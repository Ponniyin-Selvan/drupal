<p>  2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - he did<br />  not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his 15<br />  years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the kingdom<br />  was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT as<br />  generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a lot of brick<br />  temples to stone n other related endowments( would have provided<br />  lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government was<br />  responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression.

Despite all this he had to give up his throne after 15<br />  years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes to PS<br />  line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved<br />  something...or was it a compromise formula reached between PS and<br />  Uttama.</p>
<p>  3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - short<br />  tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai<br />  manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have no<br />  love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his horoscope).</p>
<p>  Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but<br />  maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS will be next<br />  in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back when<br />  PS came on....</p>
<p>  my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the<br />  services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th year<br />  of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were royality, he<br />  was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to him -<br />  we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice then) ...<br />  after a year PS went after the rest.</p>

<p>    Hello<br />    This is Shobha Ramakrishnan. I first read Ponniyin Selvan at age<br />  13 &amp; am almost reading it once in at least every two years. I always<br />  knew there should be an unwritten group of readers of this inimitable<br />  work of Kalki, but came to know only recently about an organised group<br />  such as this.</p>

<p>  Re: SabariMalai- Jyothi<br />  Posted by: "Vijay Kumar .S" <a href="mailto:vj_episteme@yahoo.com.sg">vj_episteme@yahoo.com.sg</a><br />  vj_episteme<br />  Tue Jul 17, 2007 8:13 pm (PST)<br />  Nice one rahul....todays religion makes you ask the question -<br />  are<br />  we god's creation or is god our creation...</p>
<p>  was the concept of a super power - all seeing entity created - to<br />  keep people on the `right path' - so that when no one is around ( no<br />  law enforcer is around) - people fear retribution from GOD and hence<br />  do not stray from the `right path'. is GOD humanitys moral<br />  policeman...</p>
<p>  Ummachi kanna kutthum concept ( kalki bashaila sollanumna -<br />  pullikesi kitta pudichi koduthuduven)</p>
<p>  Our organised propaganda machines are old fashioned and dont stand<br />  up to the new age reasoning - so much that today hardly a handfull<br />  of people know about vedic scriptures - they think ramayana and<br />  mahabratha /gita are the only books of hindusim - to be used only<br />  during marriage ( ok upanayayam as marriage as well) and<br />  death....mouth sync a few hymns recited by a kudumi and dhoti clad<br />  pot bellied man sporting different signs on his forehead.</p>
<p>  Going to temples has been reduced to such an ignomity due to our<br />  films - that our youngsters go there to look at auntys and tamil<br />  kalacharam ulla pengal ( incl thalaivar in shivaji).</p>
<p>  Students go around pillayar temples to pray for him to write their<br />  exams, ladies go around arasa maram to get blessed with kids....go<br />  to select temples to get married or even have a normal delivery!!!<br />  sanyasis and swamiji's incl prestigious madathipathis have become<br />  objects of ridicule.</p>
<p>  most popular abodes are the abodes of the nine planets - to rid one<br />  of the evil effects - while the masters temples are left to rot.</p>
<p>  defintely our religion is more than this - the right /wrong paths<br />  are subjective - rights are no longer rights and the wrongs are no<br />  longer wrongs. hindusim is deeper than this, but we have kept the<br />  deeper inner preachings under wraps for so long - already there are<br />  only a handful of places - our bastions in mylapore, west mambalam<br />  etc where there are pockets of communities holding on to these ....<br />  but is this enough - honestly do you think you can attract kids of<br />  these days by these stories / kan kattu vitthai...</p>
<p>  the proof is in hard numbers - ( i am not quoting these numbers to<br />  be little any of the others - but just to show what is happening)</p>
<p>  Christianity 2.1 billion<br />  Islam 1.3 billion<br />  Non-Adherent (Secular/Atheist/Irreligious/Agnostic/Nontheist) 1.1<br />  billion<br />  Hinduism 900 million</p>
<p>  Growth % 1990-2000</p>
<p>  2.65% - Zoroastrianism<br />  2.28% - Bahá'í Faith<br />  2.13% - Islam<br />  1.87% - Sikhism<br />  1.69% - Hinduism<br />  1.36% - Christianity<br />  1.09% - Buddhism</p>
<p>  Even in the above, how many would you call a true hindu ( not just<br />  born into a hindu family) - who truely knows what hindusim is - ok<br />  who has atleast heard a few hymns even once --- am not saying we<br />  should meet every sunday, or pray 5 times a day , collect funds to<br />  expand our numbers - but atleast let us not cover our inherent glory<br />  with these falses.</p>
<p>  like a child who is faced with a demon covering himself with a<br />  blanket, we hope the crisis will pass away by itself...</p>
