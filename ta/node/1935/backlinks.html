</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>There is a theory that St.Thomas met thiruvalluvar and converted him <br />to christianity.There are people who believe that Thirukural is a <br />christian book.</p>
<p>Is this true?what is the background of this story?This is how it <br />happened.</p>
<p>(Originally published under the title "Hoax!" in The Illustrated <br />Weekly of India, April 26 - May 2, 1987, Bombay)</p>
<p>It all began in the early seventies. Ganesh Iyer, who had adopted <br />the Christian faith and was a self-styled Bible preacher known as <br />John Ganesh, went to Tiruchi in the course of his evangelical <br />journeys and met a Catholic priest Father Michael of the Tamil <br />Illakiya Kazhagam (Tamil Literary Society). He is reported to have <br />presented himself to the priest as Dr. John Ganesh, professor of <br />philosophy and comparative religions at the Banaras university, and <br />recently returned from Jammu and Kashmir where he was involved in <br />research on Christianity in India. Michael put him on to another <br />priest, Father Mariadas of Sriviliputhur.</p>
<p>John Ganesh impressed Mariadas with his mastery over Christian <br />theology. He showed him copies of notices extolling him as a <br />speaker. He reportedly produced letters written to him by various <br />scholars in the fields of education and religion. He is also <br />reported to have shown Mariadas photographs of palm leaf writings <br />and copper plate inscriptions several centuries old.</p>
<p>These documents, he reportedly claimed, traced the origins and <br />development of the Christian faith in India. Since further research <br />on the subject required money which John Ganesh claimed not to have, <br />Mariadas took upon himself the task of locating funds for the <br />project the successful completion of which, he felt, would provide a <br />shot in the arm for Christianity in India.</p>
<p>Mariadas gave John Ganesh something in the range of Rs. 22,000 <br />toward the research. And as his own funds were depleted, he <br />introduced the researcher to the head of the Catholic Church in <br />Madras, R. Arulappa.</p>
<p>Arulappa was a Tamil scholar who also had the reputation of being a <br />researcher. He had translated the New Testament into Tamil and set <br />to tune the Book of Psalms. He had also rendered in Tamil the life <br />of Christ, Ulagin Uyir ( A The Life of the World ). He had learned <br />Sanskrit and translated several Christian tenets into that language. <br />He had also done extensive research on Tirukkural, the creation of <br />the Tamil bard, Tiruvalluvar.</p>
<p>Tiruvalluvar is known to modern generations through his immortal <br />literature. The exact time of his existence is lost in the mists of <br />the hoary past. Some historians believe Tiruvalluvar to be a product <br />of the early Sangam period in Tamil literature, several centuries <br />before Christ. The Tamil Nadu government bases its calendar on the <br />year of his birth. For this purpose, it is assumed that Tiruvalluvar <br />was born exactly 2018 years ago, i.e. in the first century before <br />Christ. Some literary experts place Tiruvalluvar in the first <br />century after Christ, others date him 300 years after.</p>
<p>Just as little is known about Tiruvalluvar's origins, his religious <br />beliefs are also shrouded in some mystery. Attempts have been made, <br />going by the precepts contained in his verse, to speculate about his <br />religion. While he is widely believed to have been a Hindu and the <br />Tirukkural considered a revered Hindu scripture, other religions too <br />have staked a claim on him. Since the Tirukkural enshrines the <br />ideals of ahimsa , dharma and asceticism, many experts consider <br />Tiruvalluvar to have been considerably influenced by Jain thought.</p>
<p>A recent paper presented by Dr. S. Padmanabhan makes Tiruvalluvar <br />out to be a Hindu chieftain from the Kanyakumari district. <br />Archbishop Arulappa felt that the Tirukkural was so profound and <br />filled with compassionate sentiments that it must have been <br />influenced by early Christian missionaries who came to South India <br />in the first century after Christ, notably St. Thomas, one of the <br />apostles of Christ.</p>
<p>The Christian Church of India, considered to be amongst the oldest <br />in the world, is believed to have been founded by St. Thomas in 52 <br />A.D. Arulappa held the view that St. Thomas, before his martyrdom on <br />a hill near Madras, now called St. Thomas Mount, met Tiruvalluvar <br />and influenced the bard to the extent of converting him to the <br />nascent faith. The theory had been propounded. What remained to be <br />obtained was proof of such an occurrence.</p>
<p>It was this that Ganesh Iyer, posing as John Ganesh, reportedly <br />promised to unearth for the archbishop.</p>
<p>Since this suited the archbishop's scheme and since Arulappa was <br />convinced that Ganesh was in a position to ferret out the evidence <br />necessary to prove his pet theory, he engaged him to take up the <br />research. The archbishop was apparently lulled into complacency by <br />Ganesh's mastery of Christian theology and his apparent sincerity of <br />purpose. As if establishing a nexus between St. Thomas and <br />Tiruvalluvar were not enough, John Ganesh also informed the <br />archbishop that he could bring evidence that the three wise men from <br />the East who prophesied the birth of Christ were none other than the <br />epic Hindu sages, Vasistha, Viswamithra and Agasthya.</p>
<p>In 1975-76, John Ganesh began his research. And the archbishop <br />started funding the same.</p>
<p>Ganesh produced photographs of palm leaf writings and copper plate <br />inscriptions at periodic intervals. When the archbishop asked to see <br />the originals, he was informed that they were stashed away in the <br />safe custody of the archaeological departments and museums all over <br />the country. It would therefore, not be possible to persuade these <br />agencies to part with the priceless documents. He, however, promised <br />to get his photographs authenticated by the respective agencies <br />themselves. Thereafter, all photographs produced by Ganesh Iyer <br />before the archbishop bore seals of the museums and departments from <br />which he claimed to have obtained them.</p>
<p>Using the funds provided by the archbishop, Ganesh Iyer made a <br />pretence of travelling extensively. It was a well-orchestrated <br />programme. He would first inform the archbishop that he was going to <br />Kashmir in connection with his research.</p>
<p>Next, the archbishop would receive letters from some Christian and <br />Hindu religious heads in Kashmir informing him that they had come <br />across Ganesh Iyer or, as he now called himself, Acharya Paul. The <br />letters spoke in superlative terms about his sincerity of purpose <br />and his noble research.</p>
<p>Whatever doubts the archbishop may have entertained about his <br />researcher vanished in the face of these letters from eminent <br />personages. More money changed hands. Though he was quite poor when <br />he first met the archbishop, by the time he was through, Iyer had <br />his own house in Srirangam. He owned two cars. He had purchased <br />considerable gold jewellery for his wife and daughters. He had <br />substantial deposits in banks in his name.</p>
<p>Most of the funds for the research had come from individuals and <br />organisations abroad. If Iyer is to be believed, the archbishop even <br />made out his personal car in Iyer's name for a nominal Rs. <br />25,000. .i.Iyer;Iyer himself claims that he had not paid anything.</p>
<p>Questions were being asked around this time about the large sums of <br />money being given to Acharya Paul for his research. The sceptics <br />demanded proof that something tangible, that would benefit <br />Christianity in the long run, had indeed been achieved. Only the <br />archbishop's pre-eminence prevented a direct confrontation.</p>
<p>In 1976, Iyer obtained a passport in the name of Acharya Paul. In <br />1977, accompanied by the archbishop, he went abroad. To the Vatican, <br />among other places, where he had a lengthy audience with Pope Paul <br />VI. The duo then visited several religious congregations and spoke <br />about comparative religions. Everywhere he went, he spoke about the <br />origins of Christianity in India and about his A monumental research <br />while the archbishop displayed the evidence. Money was collected for <br />funding further research.</p>
<p>During their absence from India, individuals inimical to John Ganesh <br />had organised themselves into a powerful force. Even as he was <br />relaxing in his home in Srirangam after his return, the archbishop <br />was pressurised to file a complaint with the police. That he had <br />been duped by Ganesh Iyer who had claimed to be a bachelor, but was <br />in reality a married man. That he had defrauded the archbishop to <br />the tune of around Rs. 14 lakhs in the name of research into <br />Christianity.</p>
<p>Investigations into the sordid episode began. The police, led <br />initially by Inspector Seshadri and later by Inspector Chandraya-<br />perumal, searched Iyer's residence. They unearthed the A originals <br />of all the photographs produced by Iyer as proof of his research-<br />writings on strips of brown paper cut to resemble medieval palm <br />frond writings, pasted on sheets of white paper. The police learnt <br />that the photographs had been taken at a studio in Tiruchi and this <br />led to the seizure of all the relevant negatives.</p>
<p>The police discovered how the photographs had been authenticated by <br />various institutions-seals and rubber stamps of all the concerned <br />institutions were lying in Iyer's home. Letter-heads bearing the <br />names of various Hindu and Christian scholars were recovered. The <br />letters purported to have been received by Iyer from these <br />personages, which he allegedly used to dupe Mariadas and later the <br />archbishop, were declared to be clever forgeries by the state <br />handwriting expert Srinivasan. The writing on these and the writing <br />on the brown paper, though cleverly disguised, compared favourably <br />with Iyer's specimen. Account books showing details of amounts <br />received from the archbishop and the amounts spent by him were <br />recovered.</p>
<p>Iyer's antecendents were thoroughly investigated and it was proved <br />that he was a middle school dropout, not having studied beyond <br />standard seven. Further confirmation was obtained from the Banares <br />university that they did not have Dr. John Ganesh on their staff <br />either teaching or doing research into philosophy and comparative <br />religions.</p>
<p>The police case was complete. On April 29, 1980, Iyer was arrested <br />and placed under remand, while prosecution proceedings were <br />instituted under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 <br />(cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 <br />(forgery), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 473 (making and <br />possessing counterfeit seals with intent to commit forgery) of the <br />Indian Penal Code and under section 12-B of the Indian Passports Act <br />(obtaining a passport supplying false information).</p>
<p>Archbishop Arulappa testified against Iyer before the court. Iyer <br />initially pleaded innocence, but later admitted to the fraud on all <br />counts. He prayed that in view of his advancing age and critical <br />family circumstances, he be shown leniency.</p>
<p>On February 6, 1986, P. Aruvudayappan, second metropolitan <br />magistrate, Madras, delivered his judgment in case number 100087/82: <br />A Taking advantage of the soft attitudes of public witnesses 2 and 3 <br />(Father Mariadas and Father Arulappa), he averred, A the defendant <br />(Ganesh Iyer) had taken from them about Rs. 13.5 lakhs between 1975 <br />and 1980. This has been clearly established. Taking into <br />consideration the nature of the offences, the defendant is being <br />held guilty under various sections of the I.P.C. and has to undergo <br />10 months imprisonment and 5 month's rigorous imprisonment under <br />section 12-B of the Indian Passports Act. These sentences are to run <br />concurrently. He had been arrested on April 29, 1980 and let off on <br />bail on June 27, 1980. These 59 days of imprisonment are to be <br />deducted from the total sentence as required under section 428 of <br />the code of criminal procedure.</p>
<p>The magistrate's judgment notwithstanding, doubts still linger. Why <br />were the archbishop's suspicions not aroused until he had handed <br />over a whopping Rs. 13,49,250 (according to records, though Iyer <br />claims to have received far in excess of that sum) on a spurious <br />research project? Why had the archbishop not bothered to verify the <br />authenticity of the A documents produced by Iyer with the museums <br />and other institutions concerned, directly? Why did he not bother to <br />accompany Iyer to the actual site of his A research when he had <br />found time to accompany him to Rome, the Vatican, Germany, France, <br />Spain, the United States?</p>
<p>With the archbishop still indisposed, answers to these questions are <br />not forthcoming.</p>
<p>What is even more curious is that even as criminal proceedings <br />against Iyer were in progress in the magistrate's court, a civil <br />suit for a compromise had been filed in the Madras high court. The <br />compromise decree was taken up immediately after the conclusion of <br />the criminal case. Since Iyer had admitted the offence, his jail <br />term was reduced to a mere two months imprisonment. And since he had <br />already served 59 days of remand, this period was adjusted against <br />the sentence.</p>
<p>In other words, Iyer, who had defrauded the archbishop to the tune <br />of about Rs. 14 lakhs, was let off without any further punishment. <br />He was ordered to forfeit all claim on the money given to him by the <br />archbishop. Accordingly, the ornaments and money seized from him by <br />the police were returned to the archbishop. As part of the <br />compromise, Iyer was allowed to retain the large bungalow he had <br />purchased with the archbishop's money.</p>
<p>A I agreed to this compromise because there was nothing else I could <br />do, says Iyer. His viewpoint in understandable. For, going by the <br />lower court's verdict, he would have not only had to serve 5 months <br />of rigorous imprisonment, but would have automatically had to <br />forfeit all his properties including the house. Why the archbishop <br />agreed to the compromise is not understandable.</p>
<p>Today Ganesh Iyer lives on the first floor of his house in Srirangam?<br />the lower portion is let out on rent, enabling him to receive a <br />monthly income. He is by no means affluent, but is certainly a far <br />cry from the penury to which his family and he would have been <br />consigned, if it were not for the compromise. Father Arulappa is <br />convalescing, recovering from a major surgery. He has handed over <br />the mantle of archbishop to Reverend G. Casimir on A health grounds .</p>
<p>And the case, though officially closed, remains in many minds, an <br />unsolved mystery.</p>
