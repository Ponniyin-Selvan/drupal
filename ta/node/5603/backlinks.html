</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear members,</p>
<p>A friend who is reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  (in English translation, sadly!) asked me<br />why Pazhuvettaraiyar seemingly orders the guard to stab Kandanmaran<br />while he is leaving the Suranga paadhai in vol. 1. The reasons, if I<br />remember, are not explained later in the novel. I guessed that it was<br />probably because he knew too many secrets, i.e., the suranga paadhai,<br />madurantaka devar being brought that way, or seeing Nandini in the<br />secret passage. I was wondering if there is a past discussion on this<br />in the archive....I am not too convinced by my guesses. After all,<br />Pazhuvettaraiyar needed Kadamboor Sambuvaraiyar's help at that point,<br />and it would have been inconvenient to have his son killed. Pl. let me<br />know if this discussion is already in the archive.</acronym></p>
<p>Thanks!<br />Suneeta</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>sherlock holmes and ponniyin selvan </p>
<p>Holmes fans refer to the period from 1891 to 1894 ? the time between <br />Holmes' disappearance and presumed death in "The Adventure of the <br />Final Problem" </p>
<p>one woman poked doyle with an umbrella because he had killed off his <br />charecter</p>
<p>some papers ran obituaries for the fictional charecter.<br />after starting again Conan Doyle continued to write Holmes stories <br />for a quarter-century longer.</p>
<p>but each story in itself was an episode with not much connection to <br />another unlike ponniyin selvan where the story was stopped rather <br />abruptly</p>
<p>the reasons i could attribute other than reasons already discussed<br />were <br />1) a premonition of his own death. the time between the stopping of <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and kalkis death were a few months</p>
<p>2) wanting to concentrate on amaradhara movie for which he had made <br />notes and written a partial screen play. kalki's life long ambition <br />was to succeed in movies( and perhaps beat <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  vasan on his home turf)</p>
<p>venketesh</p>

<blockquote><p>  Rahul, Very well put!! I feel similar. Also just<br />  historically another example Arthur Conan doyle, the<br />  author of Sherlock Holmes himself got so fed up<br />  writing of the same guy that he killed his hero in one<br />  episode. The angry fans went to court demanding the<br />  hero be resurrected!! Obviously the court ruled in<br />  favor of the author saying he can do what he likes<br />  with his character.</p>
<p>  But Conan doyle was so moved by his fans love for his<br />  character that he resurrected him and wrote few more<br />  episodes. We are unfortunate Amarar Kalki did not live<br />  to see his Nandhini being discussed so many years<br />  after he created her or he would have given her more<br />  detail and a sequel.</p>

<p>    &lt;< i sometimes wonder if kalki was thrusting too<br />    many things on poor<br />    nandini's head  </></p>
<p>    Sir;     you hit the nail in the head!! Im sure Kalki felt<br />    complete freedom when it<br />    came to characterizing Nandini. He gave her a<br />    villainous touch, then a<br />    damsel in distress, then revenge and last but not<br />    least ethereal beauty, for<br />    which everyone from Veerapandya to Aditya to our<br />    dear Mr.SPS (and many more<br />    in our group) have fallen hook,line and sinker.<br />    I think Kalki felt creatively stifled when writing<br />    about<br />    Arulmozhi,Aditya,Kundavai,etc as they were all<br />    historically valid<br />    characters.<br />    On the other hand he was in full flow when writing<br />    about<br />    Alwarkadiyan,Nandini, both of whom, in my humble<br />    opinion, were the best<br />    characters in the whole of PS. He felt totally free<br />    as he dint have to live<br />    upto any copper plates or kalvettus, just write!!!<br />    Kalki was so involved that he dint know how to stop!<br />    This can be seen in Dumas' 3 Musketeers also. When<br />    we are just expecting<br />    more lines or actions from the Queen, Dumas cuts and<br />    goes straight to<br />    Milady,Pothos or some other imaginary character.<br />    Maybe its what great writers do to keep the interest<br />    from stopping but i<br />    feel they feel more free in characters which are not<br />    burdened by history.</p>

<p>      We are discussing more about her because she is<br />    described as<br />        a mysterious and beautiful lady(dont we love<br />    that combination!) and<br />      the<br />        mystery is not cleared even by the author. I<br />    believe a clear'er'<br />      picture<br />        about Nandini would have made her more<br />    interesting.</p>
<p>      Hi Rahul and sivaram</p>
<p>      if we could gather all info on nandini perhaps it<br />    wil give us a<br />      clearer picture or will it make it more hazy<br />      all from kalki</p>
<p>      was born in the garden adjoining the fort to the<br />    oomairani.<br />      nandini as a baby is handed over to alwarkadiyan<br />    to bring up by<br />      anirutha brama rayar.<br />      was possibly taken to pandyanadu for up bringing<br />      suddenly appears in palayarai as a play mate for<br />    sundara's kids<br />      kundavai torments her and aditya falls for her.<br />      then she goes on a country tour singing the divya<br />    prabandhams with<br />      alvarkadiyaan<br />      then she nurses a dying veerapandyan and ses his<br />    head being choped<br />      off by an angry aaditya.<br />      actually alvarkadiyan hiding in a tree is the one<br />    who tells aaditya<br />      the direction to veerapandya's hiding place<br />      next mention of nandini is she is being bound and<br />    about to be thrown<br />      into veera pandya's pyre.<br />      next she is on the road and pazhuvetaraiyar<br />    forcibly kidnaps her to<br />      his palace.<br />      a pandya prince being brought up in the forest<br />    calls her mother.</p>
<p>      i sometimes wonder if kalki was thrusting too many<br />    things on poor<br />      nandini's head</p>
<p>      venketesh</p>
<p>        Regards<br />        Rahul</p>

        <p>Rahul and RV,</p>
<p>I agree Kalki might have mistaken in juggling Nandini's character<br />across the PS, but I still hold it as his masterstroke. May be not<br />intentional. Tell me which is most two discussed point in PS,</p>
<p>My take would be<br />1. Who killed Aditya?<br />2. Who is Nandini's father?</p>
<p>Had Kalki had wanted he could have given the answer at the post<br />script. But he never gave an hint for either of the above questions. I<br />think he was aware of the questions that might arise in the readers<br />mind and wanted to keep it a lingering thought in all the readers and<br />he has achieved it.</p>
<p>regards,<br />siva.</p>
<p>PS: Now I know how to make Rahul post a message, drag Milady in the<br />mail you can expect an reply from him :D.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Sir;   you hit the nail in the head!! Im sure Kalki felt complete freedom when it<br />  came to characterizing Nandini. He gave her a villainous touch, then a<br />  damsel in distress, then revenge and last but not least ethereal beauty, for<br />  which everyone from Veerapandya to Aditya to our dear Mr.SPS (and many more<br />  in our group) have fallen hook,line and sinker.<br />  I think Kalki felt creatively stifled when writing about<br />  Arulmozhi,Aditya,Kundavai,etc as they were all historically valid<br />  characters.<br />  On the other hand he was in full flow when writing about<br />  Alwarkadiyan,Nandini, both of whom, in my humble opinion, were the best<br />  characters in the whole of PS. He felt totally free as he dint have to live<br />  upto any copper plates or kalvettus, just write!!!<br />  Kalki was so involved that he dint know how to stop!<br />  This can be seen in Dumas' 3 Musketeers also. When we are just expecting<br />  more lines or actions from the Queen, Dumas cuts and goes stra ight to<br />  Milady,Pothos or some other imaginary character.<br />  Maybe its what great writers do to keep the interest from stopping but i<br />  feel they feel more free in characters which are not burdened by history.</p>

<p>hi</p>
<p>every writer has his style and at times get stuck to find the right <br />ending and even if he has the plot ready doesnt want to end it - so <br />the question is when to end a popular work.</p>
<p>for eg, taking dumas - his count of monte cristo ( one of our <br />personal fav) is brilliant at the start but towards the later part <br />and the end - it just keeps dragging and dragging. btw, dumas's and <br />other popular authors works are available online below</p>
<p><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/dumas/" title="http://www.online-literature.com/dumas/">http://www.online-literature.com/dumas/</a></p>
<p>so, the fans outcry when something ends - is a sense of loss - which <br />is actually a measure of the popularity of the story / credit to the <br />author,</p>

<p>Why so many years. I was told that these things were discussed in those days<br />also. But among friends and cousins (It was a joint family system in those<br />days and cousins group itself was a big gang and they discussed <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  till the<br />next issue of Kalki was published) Probably fans of those days didn't go<br />to court / protested against kalki to write more about nandhini</acronym></p>

<p>    Sir;     you hit the nail in the head!! Im sure Kalki felt<br />    complete freedom when it<br />    came to characterizing Nandini. He gave her a<br />    villainous touch, then a<br />    damsel in distress, then revenge and last but not<br />    least ethereal beauty, for<br />    which everyone from Veerapandya to Aditya to our<br />    dear Mr.SPS (and many more<br />    in our group) have fallen hook,line and sinker.<br />    I think Kalki felt creatively stifled when writing<br />    about<br />    Arulmozhi,Aditya,Kundavai,etc as they were all<br />    historically valid<br />    characters.<br />    On the other hand he was in full flow when writing<br />    about<br />    Alwarkadiyan,Nandini, both of whom, in my humble<br />    opinion, were the best<br />    characters in the whole of PS. He felt totally free<br />    as he dint have to live<br />    upto any copper plates or kalvettus, just write!!!<br />    Kalki was so involved that he dint know how to stop!<br />    This can be seen in Dumas' 3 Musketeers also. When<br />    we are just expecting<br />    more lines or actions from the Queen, Dumas cuts and<br />    goes straight to<br />    Milady,Pothos or some other imaginary character.<br />    Maybe its what great writers do to keep the interest<br />    from stopping but i<br />    feel they feel more free in characters which are not<br />    burdened by history.</p>

<p>  Hi Rahul and sivaram</p>
<p>  if we could gather all info on nandini perhaps it wil give us a<br />  clearer picture or will it make it more hazy<br />  all from kalki</p>
<p>  was born in the garden adjoining the fort to the oomairani.<br />  nandini as a baby is handed over to alwarkadiyan to bring up by<br />  anirutha brama rayar.<br />  was possibly taken to pandyanadu for up bringing<br />  suddenly appears in palayarai as a play mate for sundara's kids<br />  kundavai torments her and aditya falls for her.<br />  then she goes on a country tour singing the divya prabandhams with<br />  alvarkadiyaan<br />  then she nurses a dying veerapandyan and ses his head being choped<br />  off by an angry aaditya.<br />  actually alvarkadiyan hiding in a tree is the one who tells aaditya<br />  the direction to veerapandya's hiding place<br />  next mention of nandini is she is being bound and about to be thrown<br />  into veera pandya's pyre.<br />  next she is on the road and pazhuvetaraiyar forcibly kidnaps her to<br />  his palace.<br />  a pandya prince being brought up in the forest calls her mother.</p>
<p>  i sometimes wonder if kalki was thrusting too many things on poor<br />  nandini's head</p>

<p>Siva; Im a firm believer Kalki modelled Nandini on Milady De Winter after<br />censoring a lot. Mr.Venketesh was just informing us that Kalki could not<br />completely define Nandini, i dont this is a masterstroke and im sure neither<br />does Mr.Venketesh. I think it was a mistake on the part of Kalki to let such<br />a central character go undefined.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, we are obviously more interested in Nandini because she<br />belongs to TN. We are discussing more about her because she is described as<br />a mysterious and beautiful lady(dont we love that combination!) and the<br />mystery is not cleared even by the author. I believe a clear'er' picture<br />about Nandini would have made her more interesting.</p>

<p>Hi sampath<br />nandini was like a hot potato to kalki. he tried to juggle with her <br />till the end, not wanting to lose her and neither being able to <br />handle her.</p>
<p>he let her go alive but with a good certificate from periya <br />paluvettaraiyar.<br />pungkuzhali who gets a little level headed in the last recognizes the <br />resemblance between nandini and oomairaani.and says she wil be <br />devoted to nandini here after.</p>
<p>one thing however.veerapaandiyan in the delirium of his death throes <br />could have mistaken nadini for oomai rani because of this resemblance.</p>
<p>but kalki could never explain nandini's side of this story. <br />venketesh</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>sure she was for kalki himself</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>    Nandini was about to be thrown in the pyre by Ravidasan for not<br />  protecting Veerapandiyan</p></blockquote>
<p>a scene like this comes in three musketeers and around the world in <br />80 days. kalki seems to have been inspired by them and in a spur of a <br />moment added that scene.</p>
<p>to those who have read PS several times, nandini was certainly <br />kalki's 'sarukkal'.</p>
<p>that was more the pitfall of writing every week and comitting <br />yourself and not able to go back and correct the charecters.<br />kalki had quite a few in PS.<br />murugaiyan brother of punkuzhali was another sarukkal.<br />introduced as a physically challenged man who cant speak he later <br />talks by the ton.<br />anybody else would have been pulled up for these errors but then <br />kalki was at the pinnacle of his storytelling. i am not sure if <br />people who read it as a serial even noted them.</p>
<p>i am sure all these played a huge role for kalki abruptly stopping <br />his PS . he must have thought he couldnt go further without <br />contradicting himself.<br />new members should read a thread called " errors of kalki" where <br />these were tabulated.</p>

<p>    My humble take on Nandhini's complex relationship with<br />    Veerapandiyan is just that she really did not know who<br />    he was. He could have been father/brother/lover<br />    anyone, it is left to our imagination and quite<br />    understandable how we can be confused as readers.</p>
<p>    Nandhini's character though is just an abandoned woman<br />    who wants to use her beauty and brains to seek revenge<br />    on the world for the love and care she did not get as<br />    a child. Like many women in that situation she is<br />    often vulnerable to those who treat her with kindness<br />    and as a human instead of a beauty object - Periya<br />    Pazhuvetariar, Karikalan and Veerapandiyan were the<br />    only 3 people in h er life who gave her respect so she<br />    responded like wise that is all.</p>

<p>      I have read ponniyin selvan quite a few times but I<br />      think Kalki has<br />      confused a bit.......probably sliped a bit when he<br />      was walking<br />      between the thin line of reality and<br />      Imagination.......<br />      In one perspective we can conclude that<br />      Nandini's father is the Pandiya king who took Oomai<br />      raani with him when she as unconcious...the pandia<br />      king who died<br />      in the battle with Karikalan is his son....so<br />      nandini is his<br />      sister...<br />      In another perspective.......<br />      i gathered that nandini and mathurandakan were born<br />      to oomai rani,<br />      but st ill it is not clear about who their father.<br />      most<br />      presumably<br />      it was Pandiya king. but then again kalki raises a<br />      doubt because<br />      "how can nandini refer to her father as her lover"<br />      and in her<br />      hallucinations, nandini refers to the pandiya king<br />      as<br />      "anbe"........<br />      Not only me lot many people in the world are<br />      confused abt.<br />      If someone could throw some light on this I would be<br />      grateful.<br />      endrendrum anbudan,<br />      Ram</p>

The answer to this is not very simple I<br />      guess (if u go by what the History actually would<br />      have<br />      been)and a lot of things have to be brought to light<br />      before answering this.<br />      Instead of answering this question I would like to<br />      write a lot other things i learnt in the last couple<br />      of days during my travel to the Chola kingdom of<br />      Rajaraja chola....I had been on a religious trip to<br />      some temples near kudanthai n trichy and i happened<br />      to<br />      see the Pallippadai which Rajendra chola, son of<br />      raja<br />      raja chola has built for Panchavanmaadevi (one of<br />      the<br />      wives of Rajarajan). The question now is why did<br />      rajendra build a temple for only one of his<br />      stepmothers(n note it : not even for his mother?) n<br />      even then why only to this stepmother?! Please try n<br />      ponder over it...<br />      In the meanwhile i will try n compose a mail of<br />      all that i have learnt in the past few days from Mr.<br />      Sundhar Bhardawaj, who is an ardent fan of kalki, a<br />      very close friend of Balakumaran n who is spending a<br />      lot of his efforts in unearthing the chola history<br />      especially around the time of rajaraja chola...<br />      I am not as good a story teller as he is... but i<br />      will try my best n pass on the information to you<br />      asap...<br />      Bye till then<br />      Lavanya</p>

<p>      Yes shankar u r right. In the novel Nandhini was<br />      born to umai rani 2<br />      years after Sundara chola returned to the Chola<br />      kingdom from Boodha<br />      thevu, so there is no way that Sundara chola is the<br />      father of<br />      nandhini.</p>

        <p>Nandini was rescued by Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar, when she was about to be<br />burnt on the funeral pyre of Veerapandiyan. Only wives (not brothers or<br />other close relatives), if they want, are subjected to this horrible<br />practice. She managed to convince Ravidasan and his group that she could<br />achieve more by being alive. Does this not lead to the conclusion that<br />Nandini was considered as Veerapandian's wife by others, and she did not<br />try to dispel this idea.</p>

<blockquote><p>  My humble take on Nandhini's complex relationship with<br />  Veerapandiyan is just that she really did not know who<br />  he was. He could have been father/brother/lover<br />  anyone, it is left to our imagination and quite<br />  understandable how we can be confused as readers.</p>
<p>  Nandhini's character though is just an abandoned woman<br />  who wants to use her beauty and brains to seek revenge<br />  on the world for the love and care she did not get as<br />  a child. Like many women in that situation she is<br />  often vulnerable to those who treat her with kindness<br />  and as a human instead of a beauty object - Periya<br />  Pazhuvetariar, Karikalan and Veerapandiyan were the<br />  only 3 people in her life who gave her respect so she<br />  responded like wise that is all.</p>

<p>    I have read ponniyin selvan quite a few times but I<br />    think Kalki has<br />    confused a bit.......probably sliped a bit when he<br />    was walking<br />    between the thin line of reality and<br />    Imagination.......<br />    In one perspective we can conclude that<br />    Nandini's father is the Pandiya king who took Oomai<br />    raani with him when she as unconcious...the pandia<br />    king who died<br />    in the battle with Karikalan is his son....so<br />    nandini is his<br />    sister...<br />    In another perspective.......<br />    i gathered that nandini and mathurandakan were born<br />    to oomai rani,<br />    but still it is not clear about who their father.<br />    most<br />    presumably<br />    it was Pandiya king. but then again kalki raises a<br />    doubt because<br />    "how can nandini refer to her father as her lover"<br />    and in her<br />    hallucinations, nandini refers to the pandiya king<br />    as<br />    "anbe"........<br />    Not only me lot many people in the world are<br />    confused abt.<br />    If someone could throw some light on this I would be<br />    grateful.<br />    endrendrum anbudan,<br />    Ram</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If that is what it was - she could have met up with karikalan when <br />both were old enough and restarted the relationship. i think in the <br />interim period when she is driven away from the chola land - she <br />comes to know of her true identity.( another clue comes from the <br />fact that she uses her resemblance to her mother to play her ghost). <br />maybe she even said veerapandian was her lover to instigate aditya <br />to kill him - thereby hitting two birds with one stone - making her <br />the sole heir and also providing fresh impetus to her fighters due <br />to the gruesome killing of their wounded leader.</p>
<p>in all this, i am still apprehensive of the role of anirudar - he is <br />not the kind to throw someone into prison without an enquiry - and <br />knowing karitirumaran - he was ready to sing to anyone. so why was <br />he locked up for so many years.....</p>
<p>also anirudar had seen oomai rani alive and dead sure he would have <br />seen the resemblance in nandhini. yet he kept quiet</p>
<p>similarly - knowing that nandhini is given away to a poor household, <br />he enlists their son to be his spy......</p>
<p>inge etho idikkuthu. </p>

        <p>My humble take on Nandhini's complex relationship with<br />Veerapandiyan is just that she really did not know who<br />he was. He could have been father/brother/lover<br />anyone, it is left to our imagination and quite<br />understandable how we can be confused as readers.</p>
<p>Nandhini's character though is just an abandoned woman<br />who wants to use her beauty and brains to seek revenge<br />on the world for the love and care she did not get as<br />a child. Like many women in that situation she is<br />often vulnerable to those who treat her with kindness<br />and as a human instead of a beauty object - Periya<br />Pazhuvetariar, Karikalan and Veerapandiyan were the<br />only 3 people in her life who gave her respect so she<br />responded like wise that is all.</p>

<p>  I have read ponniyin selvan quite a few times but I<br />  think Kalki has<br />  confused a bit.......probably sliped a bit when he<br />  was walking<br />  between the thin line of reality and<br />  Imagination.......<br />  In one perspective we can conclude that<br />  Nandini's father is the Pandiya king who took Oomai<br />  raani with him when she as unconcious...the pandia<br />  king who died<br />  in the battle with Karikalan is his son....so<br />  nandini is his<br />  sister...<br />  In another perspective.......<br />  i gathered that nandini and mathurandakan were born<br />  to oomai rani,<br />  but still it is not clear about who their father.<br />  most<br />  presumably<br />  it was Pandiya king. but then again kalki raises a<br />  doubt because<br />  "how can nandini refer to her father as her lover"<br />  and in her<br />  hallucinations, nandini refers to the pandiya king<br />  as<br />  "anbe"........<br />  Not only me lot many people in the world are<br />  confused abt.<br />  If someone could throw some light on this I would be<br />  grateful.<br />  endrendrum anbudan,<br />  Ram</p>

<p>  Hi<br />  This is mainly with respect to the question "Who is<br />  Nandini?" The answer to this is not very simple I<br />  guess (if u go by what the History actually would<br />  have<br />  been)and a lot of things have to be brought to light<br />  before answering this.<br />  Instead of answering this question I would like to<br />  write a lot other things i learnt in the last couple<br />  of days during my travel to the Chola kingdom of<br />  Rajaraja chola....I had been on a religious trip to<br />  some temples near kudanthai n trichy and i happened<br />  to<br />  see the Pallippadai which Rajendra chola, son of<br />  raja<br />  raja chola has built for Panchavanmaadevi (one of<br />  the<br />  wives of Rajarajan). The question now is why did<br />  rajendra build a temple for only one of his<br />  stepmothers(n note it : not even for his mother?) n<br />  even then why only to this stepmother?! Please try n<br />  ponder over it...<br />  In the meanwhile i will try n compose a mail of<br />  all that i have learnt in the past few days from Mr.<br />  Sundhar Bhardawaj, who is an ardent fan of kalki, a<br />  very close friend of Balakumaran n who is spending a<br />  lot of his efforts in unearthing the chola history<br />  especially around the time of rajaraja chola...<br />  I am not as good a story teller as he is... but i<br />  will try my best n pass on the information to you<br />  asap...<br />  Bye till then<br />  Lavanya</p>

<p>  Yes shankar u r right. In the novel Nandhini was<br />  born to umai rani 2<br />  years after Sundara chola returned to the Chola<br />  kingdom from Boodha<br />  thevu, so there is no way that Sundara chola is the<br />  father of <br />  nandhini.</p>

<p>I have read ponniyin selvan quite a few times but I think Kalki has<br />confused a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym .......probably sliped a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  when he was walking<br />between the thin line of reality and Imagination.......<br />In one perspective we can conclude that<br />Nandini's father is the Pandiya king who took Oomai<br />raani with him when she as unconcious...the pandia king who died<br />in the battle with Karikalan is his son....so nandini is his<br />sister...<br />In another perspective.......<br />i gathered that nandini and mathurandakan were born to oomai rani,<br />but still it is not clear about who their father. most<br />presumably<br />it was Pandiya king. but then again kalki raises a doubt because<br />"how can nandini refer to her father as her lover" and in her<br />hallucinations, nandini refers to the pandiya king as<br />"anbe"........<br />Not only me lot many people in the world are confused abt.<br />If someone could throw some light on this I would be grateful.<br />endrendrum anbudan,<br />Ram</acronym></p>

<p>Hi<br />This is mainly with respect to the question "Who is<br />Nandini?" The answer to this is not very simple I<br />guess (if u go by what the History actually would have<br />been)and a lot of things have to be brought to light<br />before answering this.<br />Instead of answering this question I would like to<br />write a lot other things i learnt in the last couple<br />of days during my travel to the Chola kingdom of<br />Rajaraja chola....I had been on a religious trip to<br />some temples near kudanthai n trichy and i happened to<br />see the Pallippadai which Rajendra chola, son of raja<br />raja chola has built for Panchavanmaadevi (one of the<br />wives of Rajarajan). The question now is why did<br />rajendra build a temple for only one of his<br />stepmothers(n note it : not even for his mother?) n<br />even then why only to this stepmother?! Please try n<br />ponder over it...<br />In the meanwhile i will try n compose a mail of<br />all that i have learnt in the past few days from Mr.<br />Sundhar Bhardawaj, who is an ardent fan of kalki, a<br />very close friend of Balakumaran n who is spending a<br />lot of his efforts in unearthing the chola history<br />especially around the time of rajaraja chola...<br />I am not as good a story teller as he is... but i<br />will try my best n pass on the information to you<br />asap...<br />Bye till then<br />Lavanya</p>

<p>Yes shankar u r right. In the novel Nandhini was born to umai rani 2<br />years after Sundara chola returned to the Chola kingdom from Boodha<br />thevu, so there is no way that Sundara chola is the father of <br />nandhini.</p>

<p>Message 148 From: "sv24in" <sumeetha_pb@h...  Date: Mon Jul 8, <br />2002 6:42 pmSubject: Who is Nandini? Who is Nandini? When Ram (our <br />moderator) approached me for a weekly article based on the <br />discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how to start. <br />After much head scratching I thought<br />I would like to begin this series with a question which pops in all <br />our minds while we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?" I wonder <br />if there was a more complex character created at all by any author. <br />And the way Kalki builds her character through the entire novel is<br />beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we get to know a new <br />facet about her character and equally a new secret about her life. <br />Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />woman in a<br />palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. When <br />Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she <br />presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />powerful woman with a<br />fleet of servants to do her bidding and she also wields enough power <br />to help him get inside the Fort. After Vandiya Devan meets her we <br />know that she is an exceptionally beautiful woman. And what better <br />way could there be to compare her beauty with that of Kundavai's than<br />through a man's eyes! But it is certain that Nandini's magnetism and <br />beauty are unparalleled in the novel and she cleverly uses it as a <br />lever to wrap men around her little finger. She has a success rate <br />of 99% in creating love sick puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, <br />Aditya Karikalan, Pallava Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match <br />in Vandiya Devan who is unfazed by her hypnotic beauty. The war of <br />will between these two characters is beautiful. flirtatious yet <br />determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan escapes from <br />being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web. Why does Nandini try to <br />entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the reason immediately because <br />he does not want his audience to get the wrong impression about her. <br />She is associated with the Pandya spies who want avenge their king's <br />death. Through the course of the novel we see different <br />kaleidoscopic images of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and <br />also as an unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many <br />people. Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for <br />sure that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman? I think we can safely leave Sundara <br />Chola out of the discussion because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan <br />were born two years after Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom. The <br />crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman <br />saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />memory and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas. Karuthiruman leaves <br />them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the Pandya King's message to <br />the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall in love with her? Did <br />Mandakini have an affair with him? Now let's discuss the other <br />possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to Azhvarkadiyan that he is the <br />father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. Could this be true? We know <br />that later he falls in love with Vani, Mandakini's twin sister. <br />Could that be because he was reminded of<br />Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />recognize him? The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these <br />two individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi <br />Karai by her<br />father. But when he arrives there he finds that Mandakini has had <br />another accident with result her memory is back. Now she does not <br />recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not know what happened <br />to her from the time she fell from the lighthouse and her last <br />accident. Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman <br />to her? Was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini <br />resembles Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an <br />exceptionally beautiful woman barring the fact that she was <br />handicapped. If we assume that he had an affair with her, this fits <br />in perfectly because I cannot imagine what other business a king <br />like Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to rally <br />support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind other <br />than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had traveled <br />for a short while unless he had developed a special love or <br />affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out what <br />happened to her. Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out <br />what happened to her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his <br />baby? Karuthiruman finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being <br />brought up in Chola household but before he could get this <br />information to the king he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe <br />Veerapandiyan knows that she was pregnant but doesn't know what <br />happened to the babies or to their mother. Ram had earlier raised a <br />question in the group saying that Veerapandiyan who is rescued by <br />Karuthiruman is the father of the Veerapandiyan who is killed by <br />Karikalan. (Ref: <br /><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is also <br />possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22 years <br />before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. Either <br />way we get the same answer ?<br />Nandini is Veerapandiyan's daughter. The second possibility is that <br />Karuthiruman might be the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But <br />I find very little evidence to suggest that. All his actions prove <br />that he has been acting for the Pandya King. So it would be safe to <br />assume that he had lied to Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one <br />little point that we must note. When Karuthiruman narrates his story <br />to Vandiya Devan he starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I <br />combine some imagination as well along with the story?" Now which <br />part of it is imagination is difficult for me to concur. After the <br />babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody to <br />wonder how come they both look<br />alike. When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies <br />takes place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to <br />Nandini's house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him <br />from the Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get <br />back at the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was <br />her father? What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he <br />saw Nandini? I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out <br />the fact that Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And <br />he must have told her so as well. But Nandini confuses us all by <br />declaring to Karikalan that Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this <br />declaration takes place in the presence of Veerapandiyan who is <br />alive and kicking. How could she have declared that if she had known <br />that he is her father? Same argument can be put across if we go by <br />Ram's query. If<br />she had realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call <br />her brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />logic! Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill <br />him if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she<br />needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a <br />mad rage. Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated <br />Karikalan. She had belief in her beauty with which she was able to <br />get all her wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. <br />Karikalan in his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is <br />her lover. Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini <br />might have meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite <br />possible. Even Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few <br />chapters where he<br />and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this! Going ahead <br />with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's daughter it is no <br />surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan the way she did.  <br />Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else<br />thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love. ---------------------<br />------------------------------------------------ Message 152 <br />From: "Pavithra Srinivasan"<br />
<pavithrasri@h...  Date: Mon Jul 8, <br />2002 9:52 pmSubject: The Nandini Conundrum... Dear Sumeetha... <br />Well done. The case was well-thought out and well presented.:-) <br />(I've got a doubt though- I was of the impression that the <br />Veerapandian who had an affaire with Mandakini -I'm pretty sure that <br />Nandini was Veerapandian's daughter- and the Veerapandian who died <br />at the hands of Aditha Karikalan were one and the same...this is the <br />first I've ever heard about the 'brother' theory.) I had a <br />discussion on the same subject about a year ago with another <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  <br />fanatic. To my question about Nandini's origins, I got the reply <br />that she was undoubtedly Vaarapandian's daughter. The reasoning went <br />like this... 1) A person of Nandini's character and temperament <br />would never fall in love with any one in a space of few days (like a <br />wounded Veerapandian after math of the Madurai por). Assuming that <br />she knew something of her parentage by then, this would amount to a <br />classical "Electra complex" case study. 2) A person of Nandini's <br />character and temperament would go to any length - even to calling <br />her father her lover - for attaining what she wants. 3) The <br />chronology. Even though Kalki muddles up in the chronology, there is <br />clearly a gap of two years between, the parting of Sundara Cholar- <br />Mandagini and the birth of the twins in Pazhayarai. And these two <br />years are filled up with the Payithiyakaran a.k.a Karuthiruman <br />account. 4) The Karuthiruman story - Here he clearly states that he <br />picked up both Mandagini and Veerapandian in his "odam" and left <br />them together in northern Lanka when he went to Rohanam with Veera <br />Pandiyan's message to Mahindan. And when he returned he found <br />Mandagini pregnant. This not-so-subtle information confirms, <br />Veerapandian as the father of mandagini's twins. 5) The nature of <br />the novel. Even though p.s is a magnum opus, it suffers from a <br />serious flaw - it was serialized and it is handicapped with all the <br />trappings of a Thodarkadhai. So when in the first pagam, <br />in "Nandiniyin kadhalan", Kalki reveals a sensational item that of <br />Nandini being Veera Pandiyan's lover. In my opinion this is a <br />standard<br />trick of thodar kadhai genre to sustain reader interest - Kalki <br />would have got no inclination about how big or how long the novel <br />was going to be at that time. Later some two years later, he could <br />have decided to make Nandini the daughter and not the lover of <br />Veerapandian as he originally intended. 6) There is one more angle - <br />that Nandini knew Veerapandian was her father,when he sought refuge <br />in her house. She wanted to get back at him for abandoning his <br />mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, she does what <br />she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else her <br />lover, so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri<br />at that person - in this case VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini <br />took revenge on her father for leaving her mother destitute. Later <br />when she grieves for her father, she conveniently forgets that she <br />is the primary reason for his death and swears vengeance on the <br />cholas. This school of thought is advocated by the section that view <br />Nandini as an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi character <br />who just wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her. 7) The case <br />for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan's lover is weak. Abathudavi's claim <br />that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi before he died. <br />This could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing here as his <br />progeny (the Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have told him). <br />Thinking of a way<br />to include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her <br />as the patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the <br />continuing confrontation against the cholas after his time. He <br />doesn't know whether his official heirs have survived (like the <br />kuzhandai vandiyathevan meets). So he makes Nandini legitimate and <br />loyal to the Pandiyan cause. Well, what does everybody think? I also <br />thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or is she <br />merely a victim of circumstance??? I've<br />certain arguments there too...what do you think, Sumi? <br />Ciaow...Pavithra. </acronym></pavithrasri@h...></sumeetha_pb@h...></p>
<p>Message 154 From: "Sumeetha vijayaraghavan" <sumeetha_pb@h...  <br />Date: Tue Jul 9, 2002 1:03 pmSubject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] The <br />Nandini<br />Conundrum... Hi Pavithra, The angle about Veerapandiyan being <br />Nandini's brother was suggested by Ram in one of his threads here. I <br />think I have given the thread there. I guess we can consider the <br />possibility because if Veerapandiyan senior (the one who met <br />Karuthiruman and Mandakini) is the same one killed by Karikalan then <br />we can expect him to quite old. I guess it is difficult for think <br />that she would have fallen in love with him. But Nandini as a <br />character has puzzled me a lot for various reasons -If she wanted to <br />take revenge on the Cholas or especially Kundavai for their <br />treatment towards her the best revenge would be to marry Karikalan. <br />Being the elder brother's wife I am sure we can expect Kundavai to <br />be subservient to her in position and power. Yet she goes ahead and <br />spoils it all by telling karikalan that she had fallen in love with <br />the wounded man. Did she do it just to scorn<br />Karikalan? To show him - "You have all the power in the world but I <br />would prefer to marry a wounded and defeated king than become your <br />wife and a part of your arrogant family" Is this what she thought? <br />On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either her father or <br />brother. Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she had <br />deliberately turned Karikalan's anger on him. Why? "Electra's <br />complex" - quite possible. It can also be a deep yearning to be a <br />part of something important and dangerous. Like she<br />sees herself as a heroine liberating, avenging and taking up <br />responsibilities for an entire kingdom. We should also not forget <br />that her revenge is a double edged sword both on Veerapandiyan and <br />Karikalan. She turned Karikalan's anger on Veerapandiyan because she <br />felt that he had abandoned her mother and herself therefore he got <br />his head cut off and in the same time she took revenge on Karikalan <br />for allowing Sembiyanmadevi to send her away. In many ways her <br />revenge on Veerapandiyan was milder because it was<br />Karikalan who had to bear the guilt of his actions which was a <br />bigger revenge.

Pavithra had some very <br />interesting insights into Nandini'scharacter. 1. "A person of <br />Nandini's character and temperament<br />would neverfall in love with any one in a space of few days (like a <br />wounded Veerapandian aftermath of the Madurai por). Assuming that <br />she knew something of her parentage by then, this would amount to a <br />classical "Electra complex" case study." Now the Electra complex <br />angle was<br />something, which I had not thought about at all. That should explain <br />her attachment as well as her anger towards her father. 2. "A person <br />of Nandini's character and temperament would go toany length - even <br />to calling her father her lover - for attaining what she<br />wants." I guess that should answer Prathiba's question. 3. "There is <br />one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian washer father, when <br />he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back at him for <br />abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, <br />she<br />does what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else <br />her lover, so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri at that person - <br />in this case VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took revenge on her <br />father for leaving her mother destitute. Later when she grieves for <br />her father, she conveniently forgets that she is the primary reason <br />for his death and swears vengeance on the cholas. This<br />school of thought is advocated by the section that view Nandini as <br />an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi character who just <br />wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her." This is also quite <br />possible but we can only surmise that she wanted to be a part of <br />something<br />that is important and royal though she was responsible for <br />Veerapandiyan's death. It can also be a deepyearning to be a part of <br />something important and dangerous. Like she sees herself as a <br />heroine liberating, avenging and taking up responsibilities for an <br />entire kingdom. Was Nandini unstable? I frankly do not know. She <br />seems to be quite in control of her emotions and actions. The only <br />times we see<br />the struggle within her is when she is with Vandiya Devan. But to me <br />personally she is one of the most beautiful and yet complex <br />character created in literature. "The case for Nandini being Veera <br />Pandiyan's lover is weak. Abathudavi's claim that Veerapandian made <br />Nandini his patta magishi before he died. This could be explained as <br />Veerapandian, recognizing here as his progeny (the Mandagini - <br />Nandini resemblance would have told him). Thinking of a way to <br />include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her as <br />the patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the <br />continuing confrontation against the cholas after his time. He <br />doesn't<br />know whether his official heirs have survived (like the kuzhandai <br />vandiyathevan meets). So he makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to <br />the Pandiyan cause." Here I would like to add I.M lakshmi's views as <br />well ?"when Veerapandiyan escaped from Porkallam and met Nandhini he <br />would have mistaken Nandhini for Mandhahini. So he may have said <br />something to Nandhini as if he said it to Mandhahini.This may be the <br />reason for Veerapandian claiming nandhini as his <br />Pattamahishi.Nandhini would have worked out the truth from what he <br />said." But Lakshmi I don't agree with you. There no way <br />thatVeerapandiyan - no matter how injured he is could mistake <br />Nandini to be<br />Mandakini. The first reason being the age factor and the second <br />being the fact that Nandini is not handicapped unlike her mother. So <br />there are chances that he must have recognized her as his daughter. <br />In the end Pavithra asked me a question ? "Is Nandhini really a <br />villi...or is she merely a victim of circumstance???" I agree with <br />the latter part of her question. Nandini is undoubtedly a victim of <br />circumstances whose life has been manipulated by many people. If you <br />remember in the fourth part of the novel Kalki himself devotes an <br />entire chapter trying to unravel the turmoil of her heart where he <br />compares her life with her mother's and describes how<br />Mandakini had only the wild animals to deal with in her life in <br />jungle where as her daughter had to suffer a lot being brought up <br />amidst people. Hope that answers your question Pavithra! Guys if you <br />have any other thoughts or points to pen down please do so. I will <br />round them all up in another follow up.

<pavithrasri@h...  Date: Wed Jul 24, <br />2002 8:45 pmSubject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] The Nandini Conundrum... <br />Dear<br />Sumeetha... Sorry for the rather long gap- but I'm back anyway.:-) <br />Your views gave me a good deal of food for thought- I found myself <br />doing a lot of thinking on what you've said. About what you've said <br />about Nandhini exacting her revenge by marrying Karikalan- I though <br />of another view-point. Most of the times, the daughter-in-law of a <br />household weilds power only in name- she's generally expected to <br />keep back and do what her husband/mother-in-law tells her. The real <br />power, sometimes lies with the daughter of the house-in this case, <br />Kundhavai. Kundavai is not just the daughter of the Chola emperor, <br />but she's very popular with the masses too, and held in great esteem <br />by her people. Nandhini would be thrown into the shadow, while <br />Kundhavai would still retain her prominence. In essence, she may not <br />have been able to get her revenge at all. What do<br />you think?  On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either <br />her father or  brother. Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she <br />had deliberately  turned Karikalan's anger on him. Why? Do you mean, <br />why she made Karikalan kill<br />Veerapandian? For one thing, she is of the opinion that Karikalan <br />jilted her- in her heart of hearts, she wanted him to win her back <br />in spite of opposition. When he didn't do it, she became furious. <br />And what better way to take her revenge than to make him kill her <br />supposed lover Veerapandian (who was already three-fourths dead <br />anyway, and wouldn't have survived) in a fit of anger (notice: she <br />knows exactly how karikalan will react after he commits the deed of <br />killing her 'beloved' and knows that he will regret it because he <br />has hurt her terribly) then blame him forever? Personally, its my <br />opinion that Nandhini didn't care much about the Pandya Kingdom <br />either. *She* had been hurt by the Cholas and been humiliated by <br />them, therefore she decided to hurt them as much as she could, <br />notably Karikalan. Well...what do you think? BTW, Imli, your photos <br />are cool:-) (How are your studies going on?) Looking forward to <br />hearing more from you guys, Pavithra. Message 188 From: "Seshadri <br />Gokul" <s.gokul@l...  Date: Wed Aug 14, 2002 3:36 pmSubject:  <br />Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father Veera pandiyan MAY NOT <br />be Nandhini's father Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting <br />insights into Nandhini's parentage. My full appreciation to their <br />efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative. * Pavitra says <br />Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form ofinconsistency <br />and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan - nandini's father <br />and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not true !  <br />Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -not <br />only in the first part (Pudhu vellam) (Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but <br />even also in the fourth part ! Just before the murder of Aditya, The <br />head of Pandiyan appears before nandhini - and she exclaims and <br />talks in hallucination like this " Oh Dear ! Have you come ? <br />Welcome !....and so on ...". In fact if you carefully read the <br />novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera Pandiyan <br />she always says that he is her lover - Even at that critical moment <br />when Pandiya is in great danger! * There is only one place where <br />there is a contradiction - when she has her final talk with Aditya. <br />Even here, Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like <br />this : Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father <br />is................." Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he <br />overheard this conversation and heard that she was mentioning the <br />name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide <br />this fact directly during Nandhini's final dialogue and provides the <br />info at a much later stage ? I think there is a very very definite <br />purpose and I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly <br />ref my last lines in this mail) * Thus Kalki very deleberately <br />presents a very consistent picture throughout the Novel that Veera <br />pandiyan is indeed Nandhini's Lover. * The arguements that support <br />the fact that VPandiyan is Nandhini's father come from Karuthiruman. <br />But please remember - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his <br />story. At one point of time he says he fathered nandhini! - This <br />fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to<br />pandiyas. - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret <br />to Vandhiyathevan, that too during a time pass chat ! Remember that <br />he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly ! - Thus all of his statments <br />are to be rejected. Infact this fellow is more dangerous that all <br />others and there is more to him that what meets the eye (I plan to <br />write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future). * In <br />the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  ( I don't know whether <br />all of you have read the conclusion. It is very important for the <br />novel as a whole), Kalki says : "Just before her death, Nandhini <br />reveals her birth secret to Arulmozhi..." If Kalki felt that the <br />secret has already been revealed through Vandhiyathevan he need not <br />have written these lines at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately <br />confused the readers - he had many more ideas about the characters <br />them selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even <br />further ! Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF <br />NOT VEERA PANDIYAN????? I plan to take this topic in the near <br />future. Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome. <br />Cheers !Gokul Thread: 189, 191, 193 ---------------------------------<br />-------------------------------------- Message 189 (Attachment was <br />there)From: Prathiba<br />

I thoroughly support these views.  <br />These were exactly the lines i meant when i wrote that nandhini <br />calls veerapandian her lover. like" anbe..." etc... when she talks <br />to herself in the fourth and fifth parts (to be precise, when <br />manimekalai comes to see nandini when she is hosted by sambuvarayar{ <br />the last time i read the novel was two years ago.. but i have a <br />kinda clear picture of this} these were the words nandini says to <br />herself. she sees the head of veerapandian, calls him "en anbe" and <br />herself as his "pattamagishi". then when manimegalai comes in she <br />asks the head to go away. one can understand if she was lying bout <br />her birth to someone else. but she was talking to herself and hence <br />there can be no doubt in this regard that veerapandian was not her <br />father but her lover.

Ah, but you <br />see- that<br />was the whole idea. Nandhini was a karpanai character and so Kalki <br />could play around with it as much as he chose. He meant to leave <br />nandhini's parentage a mystery- look how many people are brought <br />into it! Kalki simply listed out a number of people who could <br />possibly be her parets, and left his readers to puzzle over it, I <br />think. Pavithra.

<p>  A friend who is reading PS (in English translation, sadly!) asked <br />me<br />  why Pazhuvettaraiyar seemingly orders the guard to stab Kandanmaran<br />  while he is leaving the Suranga paadhai in vol. 1. The reasons, if <br />I<br />  remember, are not explained later in the novel. I guessed that it <br />was<br />  probably because he knew too many secrets, i.e., the suranga <br />paadhai,<br />  madurantaka devar being brought that way, or seeing Nandini in the<br />  secret passage. I was wondering if there is a past discussion on <br />this<br />  in the archive....I am not too convinced by my guesses. After all,<br />  Pazhuvettaraiyar needed Kadamboor Sambuvaraiyar's help at that <br />point,<br />  and it would have been inconvenient to have his son killed.

<p>    Dear members,</p>
<p>    A friend who is reading PS (in English translation, sadly!)<br />    asked me</p>
<p>    why Pazhuvettaraiyar seemingly orders the guard to stab<br />    Kandanmaran</p>
<p>    while he is leaving the Suranga paadhai in vol. 1. The<br />    reasons, if I</p>
<p>    remember, are not explained later in the novel. I guessed<br />    that it was</p>
<p>    probably because he knew too many secrets, i.e., the<br />    suranga paadhai,</p>
<p>    madurantaka devar being brought that way, or seeing Nandini<br />    in the</p>
<p>    secret passage. I was wondering if there is a past<br />    discussion on this</p>
<p>    in the archive....I am not too convinced by my guesses.<br />    After all,</p>
<p>    Pazhuvettaraiyar needed Kadamboor Sambuvaraiyar' s help<br />    at that point,</p>
<p>    and it would have been inconvenient to have his son killed.<br />    Pl. let me</p>
<p>    know if this discussion is already in the archive.</p>
<p>    Thanks!</p>

        <p>Thanks...I did think it had something to do with Kandanmaran returning<br />by the suranga paadhai after sending Madurantakar and meeting<br />Pazhuvettaraiyar and Nandini unexpectedly. I seem to have forgotten<br />about his mistaking Nandini for Pazhuvettaraiyar's daughter. Is it<br />revealed later that he mistook her for the daughter? It still is a<br />pretty devious twist to the plot that he is stabbed!</p>
