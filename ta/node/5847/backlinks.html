<p>Kurunthokai 25</p>
<p>There was no one there,</p>
<p>only that man </p>
<p>who is like thief.</p>
<p>If he lies, what can I do?</p>
<p>With little green legs like millet stalks,</p>
<p>a heron searched for eels in the running water</p>
<p>when he took me.</p>
<p>Kapilar</p>
<p>(Translated by George L. Hart)</p>
<p>The Heron,indifferent and selfish , is contrasted with the heroine,who<br />gives herself to the lover.First of all,Heron is mean to be likened by<br />the world. While the heroine gives herself to her lover,the world is<br />concerned only with finding something to eat in order to stay<br />alive.The world's only concern with heroines love is to gossip about<br />it.The heron is also meant to be likened to hero who shares the<br />selfish attitude of the world. The heron's eating of the eels from the<br />running water is symbol for sexual gratification:like the heron,the<br />hero is concerned with gratifying himself, not with love and its<br />responsibilities. In the sexual act with her lover and as object of<br />gossip afterwards,the heroine is hapless as a wriggling eel in the<br />beak of the heron.The bird's leg are like millet stems.The millet stem<br />hold grain,the source of life for others and the fruit of<br />fertility,while the heron's legs hold a bird that is predatory,that<br />uses others but contributes nothing to their welfare.While it seems<br />that hero's act might lead to marriage with its fruit(children),it is<br />only a predatory act, and the hero has no intention of marrying his<br />new mistress.</p>

          What if he lies?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Vairam</p>
<p>There is no need of an apology. No offense taken, these are debates. <br />I can contest every topic in my own way but I am not sure if the <br />moderators would accept that. I have read kurunthokai and I am <br />convinced tat the nayakan kayaki kathal in Kurunji hills can be <br />attributed to Murugan Valli. I will do that for sure.</p>
<p>When a person can write Iravana kaviyam and say that this is the true <br />ramyanam, that is the power of literature, you can see in what view <br />you want it to be. I am sure every one knows the liteacy levels of <br />Pulavar Kulandai.</p>
<p>I agree, that my knowledge is practically dust compared to people <br />such as yourself and Mr.Hart so on. But you cannot discount my <br />interpretation, is how I read the poem. If it is katrathu kai man <br />alavu for avvaiyar, i am sure where I stand. <br />For me - "Yam odhiya kalviyum , yem arivum, velavar thanthanaal" - <br />Anubuthi V 17. <br />Ofcourse, we know of the 'Sutta pazham' story of avvaiyar. </p>
<p>As time moves on, people question, like how Kalki is questioned here, <br />same with any thing, I do not see anything wrong in questioning <br />interpretations. The vedas were supreme authority, Civavakiyar <br />questioned it, you pointed it out. He was termed as a mad man, by <br />some geniuses. Today we relish his work :-).</p>
<p>If you can answer on the questions I had posted on palani murugan and <br />your statement on aparajitha pallava's introduction (as you had <br />stated) on uruva vazhipaadu, it will help me in probing further by <br />checking what is myth and what is a fact. I believe, so for me a myth <br />was a fact.</p>
<p>Now:</p>
<blockquote><p> There are poems in Kurunthokai which are uttered by Concubaine(What<br /> the Concubine said).. what is the explanation for it ?...do you want<br /> to degrade your god by saying he visited Harlots?<br />a. Who is a concubine and who is not ? </p></blockquote>
<p>b. For a person such as you or me, a concubine is looked at in a <br />different view, you need to have a frame of mind to even understand <br />the concept. God is same to you or me or a stone, how we react to God <br />is what matters. <br />c. My friend, you can degrade Lord Muruga as much as you want :-) <br />but...as long as it is in tamil, such is His love for the language. <br />But what chance has a drop of dew got against a million suns ? Bring <br />it on buddy :-)</p>
<p>You ask if God visited Harlots, I say Harlots is also in God, if you <br />do not understand, thats fine, I do not expect that anyways :-)</p>
<p>Forget Andal or Ranganathar or Krsna - just read the pasurams and <br />tell me if they are not erotic enough. So would you question Andal's <br />honor ? Oh, sorry, is Andal a myth ?</p>

<p>    pl dont take this into this mode - this discussion is indeed a <br />nice <br />    topic but would prefer it on a more imperonal scale - we would <br />like <br />    to hear as many views as there are - and as long as we can stick <br />to <br />    the broad guidelines of the forum ( no personal attacks)....we <br />never <br />    know who is who in the forum and since these are in public <br />domain - <br />    its always good to have a healthy debate....its in our blood <br />after <br />    all to debate..</p>
<p>    for eg, there are a lot of works on pallava history - i have with <br />me <br />    drawings and sketches made of mallai, kanchi, srirangam, ellora, <br />    ajanta by the british ( 18th C) which will put all of us to shame <br />    with their detailing....the idea is not to comment if they were <br />    right or wrong, as SPs sir put it is for test of time to decide, <br />    future findings or future interpretations of past findings. that <br />is <br />    the charm of dwelling into the past.... but atleast we need to <br />    compliment their efforts - their meticulous nature and their <br />record <br />    keeping. compare them to portugese. well thats another story...</p>

<p>      Hi everyone,<br />      This is a very very detailed reply to prove that stance of <br />    Mr.Ravi<br />      is not true with regards to either Kurunthokai or Gorge L Hart.</p>
<p>      1. I am posting here 4 other translations of various scholars <br />of <br />    the<br />      same poem,</p>
<p>      About the Translator<br />      A.K.Ramanujan, He is considered one of the best translators in <br />this<br />      world. His translation are very famous world wide and most <br />scholars<br />      who took up Tamil research were inspired by his translations. <br />His<br />      works are so very acknowledged that an Award called <br />A.K.Ramanujan<br />      award is instituted and awarded to best translated work every <br />year.<br />      A.K. Ramanujan is popularly know for his work The Interior <br />    Landscape<br />      which is selected Translation of Kurunthokai.His verse on Red <br />earth<br />      and water is very famous and discussed already in this forum.If <br />    Tamil<br />      is known to the western world he is one of the most important <br />    factor<br />      for it.<br />      I am posting his translation of this poem</p>
<p>      Only the thief was there,no one else<br />      and if he should lie, what can I do?<br />      There was only <br />      a thin legged heron standing<br />      on legs as millet stems<br />      and looking<br />      for lampreys<br />      in the running water<br />      when he took me.<br />      (A.K.Ramanujan,The Interior Landscape)</p>
<p>      Kamil V Zvelebil, he is also another renowned scholar, google <br />his <br />    name<br />      you will know everything you need about him. I am quoting his<br />      translation below,</p>
<p>      No one was there but he, <br />      the thief.<br />      If he denies it, what shall we I do?<br />      Only a heron stood by ,<br />      its thin gold legs like millet stalks<br />      eyeing the aral fish,<br />      in the gliding water <br />      on the day<br />      he took me.<br />      (Kamil V Zvelebil,Smile of Murugan)</p>
<p>      C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature is considered <br />to <br />    be<br />      one of the great works on Tamil history. I am quoting their<br />      translation below,</p>
<p>      No one else was there, only he the thief;       should he be false,what shall I do?<br />      And when we met, there was in our sight<br />      Only the stork , with legs as thin as wisp of straw,<br />      That into gliding water peered for prey.<br />      ( C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature)</p>
<p>      This is another translation which is available, which I am <br />posting <br />    below,</p>
<p>      There were no witness <br />      when he embraced me.<br />      (If he leaves me, now what can I do?)<br />      Only the heron stood by,<br />      its thin gold legs like millet stalks,<br />      eeying the aaral fish<br />      in the flowing water.<br />      (E.Annamaalai - H.Schiffman,Mahfil)</p>
<p>      These are translation of world renowned Tamil Scholars and all <br />of<br />      their translation are similar to Gorge L Hart and means the <br />    following:<br />      The heroine who has had sexual union with her lover is worried <br />    whether<br />      he would deny that affair and cheat her.</p>
<p>      I am also quoting the word by word meaning of Tamil verse below</p>
<p>      who- ever(was)not(there) only -he the thief<br />      he that if- denies I what shall-I-do<br />      millet-stalk-like small - green leg(s)- of<br />      running- water aral(fish) seeking<br />      heron was alone (he) took (me) day.<br />      (Kamil Zvelebil, The Smile of Murugan)   </p>
<p>      2. Kurunthokai means Collection of Short poems. It is work of <br />205<br />      poets complied by Puriko. Commentaries for this book is written <br />by<br />      Peraciriyar,Naccinarkuiniyar and U.V.Swaminathan Iyer. None of <br />the<br />      these commentators have ever given an Idea that Kurunthokai was <br />    love<br />      between Murugan and Valli. I wish to ask a question if Mr.Ravi <br />is<br />      daring to question U.V.Swaminathan Iyer's interpretation and<br />      commentary on Kurunthokai.</p>
<p>      3.Kurunthokai has 27 historic allusions. If it was story of <br />Murugan<br />      and Valli, I would like to ask Mr.Ravi what those 27 historic<br />      allusions point to.</p>
<p>      4. There are references to Murugan explicitly in some poems, <br />where <br />    the<br />      hero asks heroine to do a similar act like Valli did to <br />Murugan. <br />    This<br />      a very direct indicator that the Hero and Heroine of <br />Kurunthokai <br />    are<br />      common people and not Murugan and Valli.</p>
<p>      Kurunthokai 1<br />      Making the field red with his killing</p>
<p>      he crushes demons.</p>
<p>      He has red shafted arrows,</p>
<p>      red -tusked elephants,</p>
<p>      whirling battle anklets.</p>
<p>      This hill belongs to Murugan</p>
<p>      and it is thick with clusters of blood- flowered kantal.</p>
<p>      Tipput Tolar</p>
<p>      (Translated by George L. Hart)</p>
<p>      The hero, wishing to make love to his women,has brought a gift <br />of <br />    red<br />      kantal flowers, whose acceptance means that she will have <br />him.In <br />    this<br />      poem she refuses his offering(based on commentary of U V Sa).</p>
<p>      4. There are also reference that Sangam people saw Murugan as <br />God <br />    who<br />      caused love sickness, I have written an extensive blog on it , <br />    when u<br />      finish reading it every one would surely like to question <br />Mr.Ravi's<br />      interpretations.<br />      <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/</a> </p>
<p>      5. All the foreign scholars we talk about , are not any person <br />who <br />    try<br />      their hand at translation. Each of these scholars have had <br />    intensive<br />      training in Tamil under hands of great Teachers and are <br />specially<br />      trained to read Sangam Literature. It needs special and <br />intensive<br />      training to read and understand Sangam literature. I wonder how <br />Mr.<br />      Ravi with no formal training on this note questions scholars <br />who <br />    have<br />      undergone training to read these literatures.</p>
<p>      6. Gorge L Hart is not any scholar, he is one of the most <br />respected<br />      persons in Tamil circles. People urged him to personally write a<br />      letter to Indian government to support Tamil as a classical <br />    Language.<br />      He is kept in High esteem among the scholars. I f person can <br />    commit so<br />      grave a mistake like Mr.Ravi says Hart has performed, I dont <br />think <br />    he<br />      would have had these kind of respect. Below is the link to the <br />    letter<br />      he wrote to Indian government in support of Tamil as a <br />classical <br />    Language.</p>
<p>      <a href="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-" title="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-">http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-</a><br />of-<br />    tamil-as.html</p>
<p>      These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />      I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready <br />to<br />      produce the following:<br />      1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under <br />consideration<br />      2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />      2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it <br />his <br />    own<br />      interpretation.<br />      3. Is there any written source which has been critically <br />examined <br />    to<br />      support his claim.<br />      4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has <br />    discussion<br />      of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.</p>
<p>      I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his <br />    reply. I<br />      simply cannot accept ' Fact becomes myth' story.</p>
<p>      Thank you.</p>

<p>        Dear Vijay</p>
<p>        I have heard of Mr.Hart before, he is a great literate and a <br />    person <br />        who has done immense study in tamil, I am not disputing his <br />    Tamil <br />        skill, his knowledge is amazing.</p>
<p>        But that does not mean that there is only one translation and <br />it <br />        means what he said. Other than the author, no one else can <br />        authenticate a poetic verse with a full message stating ' <br />this <br />    IS the <br />        meaning'. </p>
<p>        I am convinced on the songs as I can interpret them in a way <br />    that <br />        shows undaunted love, somewhere in the lines of Radha and <br />    Krishna or <br />        Valli and Muruga ( I chose the latter as the scenario is is <br />    Kurunji). <br />        We can even translate 'Red earth' thus.</p>
<p>        Howevr, in simple words, we cannot compare Kapilar's works <br />with <br />    a <br />        mind set of PB Shelly's translations and come up with similar <br />        translations. </p>

        <p>Ravi, please don't mistake, I have enjoyed both yours<br />and Thiru Vairam's postings immensely. Interpretation<br />of poetry is very much a question of the individual<br />and especially if the poet is no longer alive it is<br />possible to come with several interpretations it that<br />the poet may not have even imagined. I sometimes have<br />issues with poetry lovers over extending the original<br />and also with some of us thinking spiritual lovers do<br />not have same/similar emotions are human lovers. To my<br />mind it is not so.</p>

<p>    Hi everyone,<br />    This is a very very detailed reply to prove that stance of <br />  Mr.Ravi<br />    is not true with regards to either Kurunthokai or Gorge L Hart.</p>
<p>    1. I am posting here 4 other translations of various scholars of <br />  the<br />    same poem,</p>
<p>    About the Translator<br />    A.K.Ramanujan, He is considered one of the best translators in this<br />    world. His translation are very famous world wide and most scholars<br />    who took up Tamil research were inspired by his translations. His<br />    works are so very acknowledged that an Award called A.K.Ramanujan<br />    award is instituted and awarded to best translated work every year.<br />    A.K. Ramanujan is popularly know for his work The Interior <br />  Landscape<br />    which is selected Translation of Kurunthokai.His verse on Red earth<br />    and water is very famous and discussed already in this forum.If <br />  Tamil<br />    is known to the western world he is one of the most important <br />  factor<br />    for it.<br />    I am posting his translation of this poem</p>
<p>    Only the thief was there,no one else<br />    and if he should lie, what can I do?<br />    There was only <br />    a thin legged heron standing<br />    on legs as millet stems<br />    and looking<br />    for lampreys<br />    in the running water<br />    when he took me.<br />    (A.K.Ramanujan,The Interior Landscape)</p>
<p>    Kamil V Zvelebil, he is also another renowned scholar, google his <br />  name<br />    you will know everything you need about him. I am quoting his<br />    translation below,</p>
<p>    No one was there but he, <br />    the thief.<br />    If he denies it, what shall we I do?<br />    Only a heron stood by ,<br />    its thin gold legs like millet stalks<br />    eyeing the aral fish,<br />    in the gliding water <br />    on the day<br />    he took me.<br />    (Kamil V Zvelebil,Smile of Murugan)</p>
<p>    C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature is considered to <br />  be<br />    one of the great works on Tamil history. I am quoting their<br />    translation below,</p>
<p>    No one else was there, only he the thief;     should he be false,what shall I do?<br />    And when we met, there was in our sight<br />    Only the stork , with legs as thin as wisp of straw,<br />    That into gliding water peered for prey.<br />    ( C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature)</p>
<p>    This is another translation which is available, which I am posting <br />  below,</p>
<p>    There were no witness <br />    when he embraced me.<br />    (If he leaves me, now what can I do?)<br />    Only the heron stood by,<br />    its thin gold legs like millet stalks,<br />    eeying the aaral fish<br />    in the flowing water.<br />    (E.Annamaalai - H.Schiffman,Mahfil)</p>
<p>    These are translation of world renowned Tamil Scholars and all of<br />    their translation are similar to Gorge L Hart and means the <br />  following:<br />    The heroine who has had sexual union with her lover is worried <br />  whether<br />    he would deny that affair and cheat her.</p>
<p>    I am also quoting the word by word meaning of Tamil verse below</p>
<p>    who- ever(was)not(there) only -he the thief<br />    he that if- denies I what shall-I-do<br />    millet-stalk-like small - green leg(s)- of<br />    running- water aral(fish) seeking<br />    heron was alone (he) took (me) day.<br />    (Kamil Zvelebil, The Smile of Murugan)   </p>
<p>    2. Kurunthokai means Collection of Short poems. It is work of 205<br />    poets complied by Puriko. Commentaries for this book is written by<br />    Peraciriyar,Naccinarkuiniyar and U.V.Swaminathan Iyer. None of the<br />    these commentators have ever given an Idea that Kurunthokai was <br />  love<br />    between Murugan and Valli. I wish to ask a question if Mr.Ravi is<br />    daring to question U.V.Swaminathan Iyer's interpretation and<br />    commentary on Kurunthokai.</p>
<p>    3.Kurunthokai has 27 historic allusions. If it was story of Murugan<br />    and Valli, I would like to ask Mr.Ravi what those 27 historic<br />    allusions point to.</p>
<p>    4. There are references to Murugan explicitly in some poems, where <br />  the<br />    hero asks heroine to do a similar act like Valli did to Murugan. <br />  This<br />    a very direct indicator that the Hero and Heroine of Kurunthokai <br />  are<br />    common people and not Murugan and Valli.</p>
<p>    Kurunthokai 1<br />    Making the field red with his killing</p>
<p>    he crushes demons.</p>
<p>    He has red shafted arrows,</p>
<p>    red -tusked elephants,</p>
<p>    whirling battle anklets.</p>
<p>    This hill belongs to Murugan</p>
<p>    and it is thick with clusters of blood- flowered kantal.</p>
<p>    Tipput Tolar</p>
<p>    (Translated by George L. Hart)</p>
<p>    The hero, wishing to make love to his women,has brought a gift of <br />  red<br />    kantal flowers, whose acceptance means that she will have him.In <br />  this<br />    poem she refuses his offering(based on commentary of U V Sa).</p>
<p>    4. There are also reference that Sangam people saw Murugan as God <br />  who<br />    caused love sickness, I have written an extensive blog on it , <br />  when u<br />    finish reading it every one would surely like to question Mr.Ravi's<br />    interpretations.<br />    <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/</a> </p>
<p>    5. All the foreign scholars we talk about , are not any person who <br />  try<br />    their hand at translation. Each of these scholars have had <br />  intensive<br />    training in Tamil under hands of great Teachers and are specially<br />    trained to read Sangam Literature. It needs special and intensive<br />    training to read and understand Sangam literature. I wonder how Mr.<br />    Ravi with no formal training on this note questions scholars who <br />  have<br />    undergone training to read these literatures.</p>
<p>    6. Gorge L Hart is not any scholar, he is one of the most respected<br />    persons in Tamil circles. People urged him to personally write a<br />    letter to Indian government to support Tamil as a classical <br />  Language.<br />    He is kept in High esteem among the scholars. I f person can <br />  commit so<br />    grave a mistake like Mr.Ravi says Hart has performed, I dont think <br />  he<br />    would have had these kind of respect. Below is the link to the <br />  letter<br />    he wrote to Indian government in support of Tamil as a classical <br />  Language.</p>
<p>    <a href="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-" title="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-">http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-</a><br />  tamil-as.html</p>
<p>    These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />    I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready to<br />    produce the following:<br />    1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under consideration<br />    2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />    2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it his <br />  own<br />    interpretation.<br />    3. Is there any written source which has been critically examined <br />  to<br />    support his claim.<br />    4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has <br />  discussion<br />    of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.</p>
<p>    I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his <br />  reply. I<br />    simply cannot accept ' Fact becomes myth' story.</p>
<p>    Thank you.</p>

<p>      Dear Vijay</p>
<p>      I have heard of Mr.Hart before, he is a great literate and a <br />  person <br />      who has done immense study in tamil, I am not disputing his <br />  Tamil <br />      skill, his knowledge is amazing.</p>
<p>      But that does not mean that there is only one translation and it <br />      means what he said. Other than the author, no one else can <br />      authenticate a poetic verse with a full message stating ' this <br />  IS the <br />      meaning'. </p>
<p>      I am convinced on the songs as I can interpret them in a way <br />  that <br />      shows undaunted love, somewhere in the lines of Radha and <br />  Krishna or <br />      Valli and Muruga ( I chose the latter as the scenario is is <br />  Kurunji). <br />      We can even translate 'Red earth' thus.</p>
<p>      Howevr, in simple words, we cannot compare Kapilar's works with <br />  a <br />      mind set of PB Shelly's translations and come up with similar <br />      translations. </p>

<p>          While reading Mr.Hart's translations, i am wondering how <br />      Kapilar's <br />          genius can also be read in very simple worldly terms. <br />          Mr.Hart.... your words on our Valli and her love for our <br />  Lord, <br />      are <br />          heart breaking and misleading.</p>
<p>          I should insist that western people unless they understand <br />  the <br />          intricacies of our beliefs, will come out with such <br />  translations.</p>

<p>  2. Kurunthokai means Collection of Short poems. It is work of 205<br />  poets complied by Puriko. Commentaries for this book is written by<br />  Peraciriyar,Naccinarkuiniyar and U.V.Swaminathan Iyer.

        <p>I am also have one more question for Mr.Ravi</p>
<p>There are poems in Kurunthokai which are uttered by Concubaine(What<br />the Concubine said).. what is the explanation for it ?...do you want<br />to degrade your god by saying he visited Harlots?</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi everyone,<br />  This is a very very detailed reply to prove that stance of Mr.Ravi<br />  is not true with regards to either Kurunthokai or Gorge L Hart.</p>
<p>  1. I am posting here 4 other translations of various scholars of the<br />  same poem,</p>
<p>  About the Translator<br />  A.K.Ramanujan, He is considered one of the best translators in this<br />  world. His translation are very famous world wide and most scholars<br />  who took up Tamil research were inspired by his translations. His<br />  works are so very acknowledged that an Award called A.K.Ramanujan<br />  award is instituted and awarded to best translated work every year.<br />  A.K. Ramanujan is popularly know for his work The Interior Landscape<br />  which is selected Translation of Kurunthokai.His verse on Red earth<br />  and water is very famous and discussed already in this forum.If Tamil<br />  is known to the western world he is one of the most important factor<br />  for it.<br />  I am posting his translation of this poem</p>
<p>  Only the thief was there,no one else<br />  and if he should lie, what can I do?<br />  There was only <br />  a thin legged heron standing<br />  on legs as millet stems<br />  and looking<br />  for lampreys<br />  in the running water<br />  when he took me.<br />  (A.K.Ramanujan,The Interior Landscape)</p>
<p>  Kamil V Zvelebil, he is also another renowned scholar, google his name<br />  you will know everything you need about him. I am quoting his<br />  translation below,</p>
<p>  No one was there but he, <br />  the thief.<br />  If he denies it, what shall we I do?<br />  Only a heron stood by ,<br />  its thin gold legs like millet stalks<br />  eyeing the aral fish,<br />  in the gliding water <br />  on the day<br />  he took me.<br />  (Kamil V Zvelebil,Smile of Murugan)</p>
<p>  C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature is considered to be<br />  one of the great works on Tamil history. I am quoting their<br />  translation below,</p>
<p>  No one else was there, only he the thief;   should he be false,what shall I do?<br />  And when we met, there was in our sight<br />  Only the stork , with legs as thin as wisp of straw,<br />  That into gliding water peered for prey.<br />  ( C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature)</p>
<p>  This is another translation which is available, which I am posting<br />below,</p>
<p>  There were no witness <br />  when he embraced me.<br />  (If he leaves me, now what can I do?)<br />  Only the heron stood by,<br />  its thin gold legs like millet stalks,<br />  eeying the aaral fish<br />  in the flowing water.<br />  (E.Annamaalai - H.Schiffman,Mahfil)</p>
<p>  These are translation of world renowned Tamil Scholars and all of<br />  their translation are similar to Gorge L Hart and means the following:<br />  The heroine who has had sexual union with her lover is worried whether<br />  he would deny that affair and cheat her.</p>
<p>  I am also quoting the word by word meaning of Tamil verse below</p>
<p>  who- ever(was)not(there) only -he the thief<br />  he that if- denies I what shall-I-do<br />  millet-stalk-like small - green leg(s)- of<br />  running- water aral(fish) seeking<br />  heron was alone (he) took (me) day.<br />  (Kamil Zvelebil, The Smile of Murugan)   </p>
<p>  2. Kurunthokai means Collection of Short poems. It is work of 205<br />  poets complied by Puriko. Commentaries for this book is written by<br />  Peraciriyar,Naccinarkuiniyar and U.V.Swaminathan Iyer. None of the<br />  these commentators have ever given an Idea that Kurunthokai was love<br />  between Murugan and Valli. I wish to ask a question if Mr.Ravi is<br />  daring to question U.V.Swaminathan Iyer's interpretation and<br />  commentary on Kurunthokai.</p>
<p>  3.Kurunthokai has 27 historic allusions. If it was story of Murugan<br />  and Valli, I would like to ask Mr.Ravi what those 27 historic<br />  allusions point to.</p>
<p>  4. There are references to Murugan explicitly in some poems, where the<br />  hero asks heroine to do a similar act like Valli did to Murugan. This<br />  a very direct indicator that the Hero and Heroine of Kurunthokai are<br />  common people and not Murugan and Valli.</p>
<p>  Kurunthokai 1<br />  Making the field red with his killing</p>
<p>  he crushes demons.</p>
<p>  He has red shafted arrows,</p>
<p>  red -tusked elephants,</p>
<p>  whirling battle anklets.</p>
<p>  This hill belongs to Murugan</p>
<p>  and it is thick with clusters of blood- flowered kantal.</p>
<p>  Tipput Tolar</p>
<p>  (Translated by George L. Hart)</p>
<p>  The hero, wishing to make love to his women,has brought a gift of red<br />  kantal flowers, whose acceptance means that she will have him.In this<br />  poem she refuses his offering(based on commentary of U V Sa).</p>
<p>  4. There are also reference that Sangam people saw Murugan as God who<br />  caused love sickness, I have written an extensive blog on it , when u<br />  finish reading it every one would surely like to question Mr.Ravi's<br />  interpretations.<br />  <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/</a> </p>
<p>  5. All the foreign scholars we talk about , are not any person who try<br />  their hand at translation. Each of these scholars have had intensive<br />  training in Tamil under hands of great Teachers and are specially<br />  trained to read Sangam Literature. It needs special and intensive<br />  training to read and understand Sangam literature. I wonder how Mr.<br />  Ravi with no formal training on this note questions scholars who have<br />  undergone training to read these literatures.</p>
<p>  6. Gorge L Hart is not any scholar, he is one of the most respected<br />  persons in Tamil circles. People urged him to personally write a<br />  letter to Indian government to support Tamil as a classical Language.<br />  He is kept in High esteem among the scholars. I f person can commit so<br />  grave a mistake like Mr.Ravi says Hart has performed, I dont think he<br />  would have had these kind of respect. Below is the link to the letter<br />  he wrote to Indian government in support of Tamil as a classical<br />Language.</p>
<p><a href="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-tamil-as.html" title="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-tamil-as.html">http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-tamil-a...</a></p>
<p>  These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />  I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready to<br />  produce the following:<br />  1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under consideration<br />  2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />  2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it his own<br />  interpretation.<br />  3. Is there any written source which has been critically examined to<br />  support his claim.<br />  4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has discussion<br />  of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.</p>
<p>  I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his reply. I<br />  simply cannot accept ' Fact becomes myth' story.</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>

<p>    I have heard of Mr.Hart before, he is a great literate and a person <br />    who has done immense study in tamil, I am not disputing his Tamil <br />    skill, his knowledge is amazing.</p>
<p>    But that does not mean that there is only one translation and it <br />    means what he said. Other than the author, no one else can <br />    authenticate a poetic verse with a full message stating ' this IS the <br />    meaning'. </p>
<p>    I am convinced on the songs as I can interpret them in a way that <br />    shows undaunted love, somewhere in the lines of Radha and Krishna or <br />    Valli and Muruga ( I chose the latter as the scenario is is Kurunji). <br />    We can even translate 'Red earth' thus.</p>

<p>These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready to<br />produce the following:<br />1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under consideration<br />2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it his own<br />interpretation.<br />3. Is there any written source which has been critically examined to<br />support his claim.<br />4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has discussion<br />of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.</p>
<p>I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his reply. I<br />simply cannot accept ' Fact becomes myth' story.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The kurunthogai is compilation of love - Valli over Lord muruga. <br />Kura valli is she who rules over nature in its very native form.</p>
<p>I guess it has been looked over in very literal meanings. When I read <br />these lines, my heart melted for the amount of love in bhakti Valli <br />has displayed. (please read the song kalki wrote on murugan in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  <br />also). Great works which if read properly will bring tears in any <br />devotee.</acronym></p>
<p>Here is what I interpret:<br />the guy who stole my heart, it is none but He, He said he will come <br />and take me, and I wait here on that, but his words were not true.<br />The girl who guards the corn fields (Valli), waits for you on her <br />little green feet as would a heron that waits upstream, you took her <br />in or blended her in you.<br />Note:<br />It is said that Lord muruga was so deep in love with Valli that He <br />fell at her feet, something He has never done to any other, but <br />grants that wish to her bhakti. <br />Thirupugazh song Aruthi vazhvodu: <br />Isaitha naavinan ithanodu kurra magal iru paatham.</p>
<p>Valli is presented in green color and she is the guardian of corn <br />fields. (Again there is a philosophical meaning for both Valli and <br />the corn fields).</p>
<p>While reading Mr.Hart's translations, i am wondering how Kapilar's <br />genius can also be read in very simple worldly terms. <br />Mr.Hart.... your words on our Valli and her love for our Lord, are <br />heart breaking and misleading.</p>
<p>I should insist that western people unless they understand the <br />intricacies of our beliefs, will come out with such translations.</p>
<p>I feel I can only quote paana pathirar's words t the Lord 'Intha <br />ooruku pazhi nernthal unakindri yenakkilai'.</p>

<p>  Kurunthokai 25</p>
<p>  There was no one there,</p>
<p>  only that man </p>
<p>  who is like thief.</p>
<p>  If he lies, what can I do?</p>
<p>  With little green legs like millet stalks,</p>
<p>  a heron searched for eels in the running water</p>
<p>  when he took me.</p>
<p>  Kapilar</p>
<p>  (Translated by George L. Hart)</p>
<p>  The Heron,indifferent and selfish , is contrasted with the <br />heroine,who<br />  gives herself to the lover.First of all,Heron is mean to be likened <br />by<br />  the world. While the heroine gives herself to her lover,the world is<br />  concerned only with finding something to eat in order to stay<br />  alive.The world's only concern with heroines love is to gossip about<br />  it.The heron is also meant to be likened to hero who shares the<br />  selfish attitude of the world. The heron's eating of the eels from <br />the<br />  running water is symbol for sexual gratification:like the heron,the<br />  hero is concerned with gratifying himself, not with love and its<br />  responsibilities. In the sexual act with her lover and as object of<br />  gossip afterwards,the heroine is hapless as a wriggling eel in the<br />  beak of the heron.The bird's leg are like millet stems.The millet <br />stem<br />  hold grain,the source of life for others and the fruit of<br />  fertility,while the heron's legs hold a bird that is predatory,that<br />  uses others but contributes nothing to their welfare.While it seems<br />  that hero's act might lead to marriage with its fruit(children),it <br />is<br />  only a predatory act, and the hero has no intention of marrying his<br />  new mistress.</p>
