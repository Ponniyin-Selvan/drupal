<p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>You never stop me from admiring you. One of the 'class apart' <br />personality I have come across. I think the members will agree with <br />me to credit you with the title 'THE GREAT', if not in Indian/tamil <br />history, atleast in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group history. </p>
<p>Kamal's title to you - Seyal Puyal Sundar - very much apt..</p>
<p>Kamal and Arun,and others in Japan,</p>
<p>I too heard the news of Tsunami warning and wanted to enquire. Good <br />to know that nothing serious happened. Great god.</p>
<p>Sri,<br />Eager to meet you in Feb. If you can share your program details, <br />probably we can start planning for a short trip. As SPS said, lets <br />try to make this a rememberable trip :)</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p></acronym></p>

<p>    The bombing of Rangoon touched me in a personal way. I have heard the<br />  story<br />    from my maternal grandfather. He worked for the meteorological office<br />  in<br />    Rangoon. One day, on his way to work, the air raid sirens blew, and<br />  they all<br />    ran to get to some trenches. However, before my grandfather could get<br />  into<br />    one, one of the bombs burst and a fragment pierced the right side of<br />  his<br />    chest. He tore off his shirt and stuffed it into the wound and<br />  somehow, in<br />    that bleeding condition ran to the local hospital. The duty doctor ( a<br />  lady)<br />    had just finished her shift and was leaving for home when my<br />  grandfather<br />    collapsed at her feet with the words "doctor please save me". His<br />  family,<br />    consisting of my grandmother, my koLLUppaatti and 5 kids (my mom<br />  wasn't born<br />    then) of which the youngest was a year and a half had no clue as to<br />  what<br />    happened to him. Finally, a british lady, very kindly lent my<br />  grandmother<br />    the use of her vehicle to go search for him and she visited the<br />  hospital and<br />    eventually located him there. The families were then evacuated by<br />  train to<br />    Calcutta; only the women and children though. My grandfather, in that<br />    enfeebled condition, walked all the way from Rangoon to Calcutta. He<br />    mentioned that on the way he saw lots of people collapse through<br />  exhaustion<br />    and the others just left them and kept walking. To stop moving was to<br />    perish, according to him.</p>
<p>    There is a nice postscript to this story. When one of my uncles<br />  eventually<br />    passed out of AIIMS as a doctor, my grandfather tracked down the lady<br />  doctor<br />    who had saved him, who was then living in Delhi, and took him to her<br />  house<br />    to tell her that he had vowed to make at least one of his kids into a<br />  doctor<br />    because of the fact that that lady had saved his life.</p>
<p>    I remember even now the place where the shrapnel went through on the<br />  right<br />    side of his chest and exited from behind his shoulder blade... I used<br />  to<br />    touch it and ti was always very soft.. like there was just this thin<br />  tissue<br />    between my finger and the whole.</p>
<p>    I have always wanted to write a story about this. Maybe I will :)</p>

<p>      Dear Sri,</p>
<p>      I dont know who has written this above chunk about an unknown novel<br />  on<br />      Nayakars.</p>
<p>      I think, it could be "Chandra Vadhana" which has 2 big volumes. It<br />  is<br />      an excellent story of later Nayaks. A nicely blended love and<br />  bravery<br />      between Trichy Nayaks and Madurai Nayaks. The story line is a<br />      generation after ThirumalaiNayakar. It is during the teens of "Rani<br />      Mangammal" who will be addressed as "MuthuNagai" in the story.</p>
<p>      I also dont remember the author....but excellent novel to read.</p>

<p>        Dear All<br />        Was just going thro old mails there very good discussions on<br />        Sandilyan and Kalki between mails 2700-2800<br />        Reagrds<br />        Sri</p>
<p>        Dear Vaithi</p>
<p>        I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire<br />  Kalki<br />        but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading<br />        Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th<br />        time. ,</p>
<p>          The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his<br />        Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir(<br />        Kadal Pura)</p>
<p>        Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in<br />  SS<br />        its<br />        Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes.<br />  Thats<br />        their<br />        style. Now I<br />        dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is<br />        the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a<br />        sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.</p>
<p>          One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some<br />  times<br />        a bit<br />        more than the normal...</p>
<p>        What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the<br />        individuals<br />        concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy<br />  it<br />        and<br />        later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against<br />  romance, I<br />        feel.<br />        (Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)</p>
<p>        Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type<br />        panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to<br />        finish reading the<br />        book. I dont<br />        deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced<br />        masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to<br />        call for an epic status in thamil is<br />        PS Sandilyans work are more<br />        masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the<br />        will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it<br />  will<br />        be roaring success <br />        The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...<br />          Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the<br />  hero...<br />          The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the<br />  enemy<br />        is not<br />        expecting...<br />        This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero<br />        senja<br />        then the villain becomes a hero.<br />        what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in<br />        kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the<br />  same<br />        tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the<br />        same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his<br />  aides<br />        guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....<br />          the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a<br />        suspense<br />        note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working<br />  towards<br />        that<br />        suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>
<p>        Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda<br />  poruppu<br />        illaya. Adutha chapterku ilucuradu vera</p>
<p>  ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTHHHH<br />        HHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU vera<br />        Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni<br />        anuppiduvungala? Unfortunately the answer is Yes If<br />        that was what they need that was it.</p>
<p>          Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed<br />  to<br />        other<br />        authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight<br />        among<br />        themselves.</p>
<p>        Can you please tell me more about our south India history where<br />  the<br />        females<br />        played great roles in administering our territories?<br />        Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in<br />  shaping<br />        the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not<br />        administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum<br />        greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are<br />        depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding<br />        them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and<br />  orchestrad<br />        on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like<br />        Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her<br />  tune...<br />          Akilan<br />          Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the<br />        same time<br />        doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more<br />        charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin<br />  Mainthan<br />        had 4<br />        main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the<br />        times<br />        and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<p>        I really feel personally that a little bit of romance in vengaiyin<br />        mainthan<br />        would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that<br />        when<br />        lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to<br />  be<br />        away,<br />        chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.<br />          There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of<br />        Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to<br />  Irwing<br />        Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the<br />        latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no<br />  love<br />        life(physical..)Its just the author chooses to ignore it...<br />        I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo<br />  and<br />        rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />          Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one<br />  should<br />        not<br />        write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura<br />        nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki<br />  who<br />        seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of<br />        Rajendra is<br />        done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>        Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to<br />  go<br />        in<br />        search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would<br />        have read<br />        PS first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have<br />        been<br />        your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing<br />        the same<br />        situation from a different angle.<br />        Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA<br />  what<br />        do you say about NN<br />        And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember<br />        neither<br />        the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between<br />        nayakkars<br />        and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really<br />  pacy.</p>

One day, on his way to work, the air raid sirens blew, and<br />they all<br />  ran to get to some trenches. However, before my grandfather could get<br />into<br />  one, one of the bombs burst and a fragment pierced the right side of<br />his<br />  chest. He tore off his shirt and stuffed it into the wound and<br />somehow, in<br />  that bleeding condition ran to the local hospital. The duty doctor ( a<br />lady)<br />  had just finished her shift and was leaving for home when my<br />grandfather<br />  collapsed at her feet with the words "doctor please save me". His<br />family,<br />  consisting of my grandmother, my koLLUppaatti and 5 kids (my mom<br />wasn't born<br />  then) of which the youngest was a year and a half had no clue as to<br />what<br />  happened to him. Finally, a british lady, very kindly lent my<br />grandmother<br />  the use of her vehicle to go search for him and she visited the<br />hospital and<br />  eventually located him there. The families were then evacuated by<br />train to<br />  Calcutta; only the women and children though. My grandfather, in that<br />  enfeebled condition, walked all the way from Rangoon to Calcutta. He<br />  mentioned that on the way he saw lots of people collapse through<br />exhaustion<br />  and the others just left them and kept walking. To stop moving was to<br />  perish, according to him.</p>
<p>  There is a nice postscript to this story. When one of my uncles<br />eventually<br />  passed out of AIIMS as a doctor, my grandfather tracked down the lady<br />doctor<br />  who had saved him, who was then living in Delhi, and took him to her<br />house<br />  to tell her that he had vowed to make at least one of his kids into a<br />doctor<br />  because of the fact that that lady had saved his life.</p>
<p>  I remember even now the place where the shrapnel went through on the<br />right<br />  side of his chest and exited from behind his shoulder blade... I used<br />to<br />  touch it and ti was always very soft.. like there was just this thin<br />tissue<br />  between my finger and the whole.</p>
<p>  I have always wanted to write a story about this. Maybe I will :)</p>

<p>    Dear Sri,</p>
<p>    I dont know who has written this above chunk about an unknown novel<br />on<br />    Nayakars.</p>
<p>    I think, it could be "Chandra Vadhana" which has 2 big volumes. It<br />is<br />    an excellent story of later Nayaks. A nicely blended love and<br />bravery<br />    between Trichy Nayaks and Madurai Nayaks. The story line is a<br />    generation after ThirumalaiNayakar. It is during the teens of "Rani<br />    Mangammal" who will be addressed as "MuthuNagai" in the story.</p>
<p>    I also dont remember the author....but excellent novel to read.</p>

<p>      Dear All<br />      Was just going thro old mails there very good discussions on<br />      Sandilyan and Kalki between mails 2700-2800<br />      Reagrds<br />      Sri</p>
<p>      Dear Vaithi</p>
<p>      I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire<br />Kalki<br />      but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading<br />      Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th<br />      time. ,</p>
<p>        The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his<br />      Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir(<br />      Kadal Pura)</p>
<p>      Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in<br />SS<br />      its<br />      Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes.<br />Thats<br />      their<br />      style. Now I<br />      dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is<br />      the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a<br />      sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.</p>
<p>        One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some<br />times<br />      a bit<br />      more than the normal...</p>
<p>      What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the<br />      individuals<br />      concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy<br />it<br />      and<br />      later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against<br />romance, I<br />      feel.<br />      (Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)</p>
<p>      Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type<br />      panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to<br />      finish reading the<br />      book. I dont<br />      deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced<br />      masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to<br />      call for an epic status in thamil is<br />      PS Sandilyans work are more<br />      masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the<br />      will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it<br />will<br />      be roaring success <br />      The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...<br />        Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the<br />hero...<br />        The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the<br />enemy<br />      is not<br />      expecting...<br />      This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero<br />      senja<br />      then the villain becomes a hero.<br />      what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in<br />      kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the<br />same<br />      tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the<br />      same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his<br />aides<br />      guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....<br />        the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a<br />      suspense<br />      note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working<br />towards<br />      that<br />      suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>
<p>      Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda<br />poruppu<br />      illaya. Adutha chapterku ilucuradu vera</p>
<p>ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTHHHH<br />      HHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU vera<br />      Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni<br />      anuppiduvungala? Unfortunately the answer is Yes If<br />      that was what they need that was it.</p>
<p>        Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed<br />to<br />      other<br />      authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight<br />      among<br />      themselves.</p>
<p>      Can you please tell me more about our south India history where<br />the<br />      females<br />      played great roles in administering our territories?<br />      Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in<br />shaping<br />      the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not<br />      administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum<br />      greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are<br />      depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding<br />      them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and<br />orchestrad<br />      on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like<br />      Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her<br />tune...<br />        Akilan<br />        Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the<br />      same time<br />      doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more<br />      charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin<br />Mainthan<br />      had 4<br />      main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the<br />      times<br />      and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<p>      I really feel personally that a little bit of romance in vengaiyin<br />      mainthan<br />      would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that<br />      when<br />      lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to<br />be<br />      away,<br />      chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.<br />        There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of<br />      Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to<br />Irwing<br />      Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the<br />      latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no<br />love<br />      life(physical..)Its just the author chooses to ignore it...<br />      I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo<br />and<br />      rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />        Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one<br />should<br />      not<br />      write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura<br />      nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki<br />who<br />      seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of<br />      Rajendra is<br />      done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>      Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to<br />go<br />      in<br />      search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would<br />      have read<br />      PS first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have<br />      been<br />      your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing<br />      the same<br />      situation from a different angle.<br />      Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA<br />what<br />      do you say about NN<br />      And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember<br />      neither<br />      the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between<br />      nayakkars<br />      and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really<br />pacy.</p>

<p>      Dear All<br />      Was just going thro old mails there very good discussions on<br />      Sandilyan and Kalki between mails 2700-2800<br />      Reagrds<br />      Sri</p>
<p>      Dear Vaithi</p>
<p>      I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire Kalki<br />      but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading<br />      Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th<br />      time. ,</p>
<p>        The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his<br />      Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir(<br />      Kadal Pura)</p>
<p>      Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in SS<br />      its<br />      Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats<br />      their<br />      style. Now I<br />      dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is<br />      the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a<br />      sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.</p>
<p>        One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times<br />      a bit<br />      more than the normal...</p>
<p>      What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the<br />      individuals<br />      concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it<br />      and<br />      later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, I<br />      feel.<br />      (Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)</p>
<p>      Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type<br />      panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to<br />      finish reading the<br />      book. I dont<br />      deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced<br />      masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to<br />      call for an epic status in thamil is<br />      PS Sandilyans work are more<br />      masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the<br />      will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it will<br />      be roaring success <br />      The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...<br />        Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero...<br />        The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy<br />      is not<br />      expecting...<br />      This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero<br />      senja<br />      then the villain becomes a hero.<br />      what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in<br />      kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the same<br />      tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the<br />      same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his aides<br />      guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....<br />        the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a<br />      suspense<br />      note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards<br />      that<br />      suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>
<p>      Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda poruppu<br />      illaya.

Unfortunately the answer is Yes If<br />      that was what they need that was it.</p>
<p>        Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed to<br />      other<br />      authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight<br />      among<br />      themselves.</p>
<p>      Can you please tell me more about our south India history where the<br />      females<br />      played great roles in administering our territories?<br />      Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in shaping<br />      the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not<br />      administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum<br />      greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are<br />      depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding<br />      them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and orchestrad<br />      on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like<br />      Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her tune...<br />        Akilan<br />        Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the<br />      same time<br />      doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more<br />      charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin Mainthan<br />      had 4<br />      main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the<br />      times<br />      and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<p>      I really feel personally that a little bit of romance in vengaiyin<br />      mainthan<br />      would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that<br />      when<br />      lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to be<br />      away,<br />      chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.<br />        There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of<br />      Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to Irwing<br />      Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the<br />      latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no love<br />      life(physical..)Its just the author chooses to ignore it...<br />      I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo and<br />      rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />        Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should<br />      not<br />      write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura<br />      nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who<br />      seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of<br />      Rajendra is<br />      done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>      Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to go<br />      in<br />      search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would<br />      have read<br />      PS first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have<br />      been<br />      your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing<br />      the same<br />      situation from a different angle.<br />      Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA what<br />      do you say about NN<br />      And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember<br />      neither<br />      the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between<br />      nayakkars<br />      and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really pacy.</p>
<p>      There wont be a hot reply because we are just dicussing books</p>

<p>Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@gmail.com  wrote:<br />The bombing of Rangoon touched me in a personal way. I have heard the story from my maternal grandfather. He worked for the meteorological office in Rangoon. One day, on his way to work, the <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym raid sirens blew, and they all ran to get to some trenches. However, before my grandfather could get into one, one of the bombs burst and a fragment pierced the right side of his chest. He tore off his shirt and stuffed it into the wound and somehow, in that bleeding condition ran to the local hospital. The duty doctor ( a lady) had just finished her shift and was leaving for home when my grandfather collapsed at her feet with the words "doctor please save me". His family, consisting of my grandmother, my koLLUppaatti and 5 kids (my mom wasn't born then) of which the youngest was a year and a half had no clue as to what happened to him. Finally, a british lady, very kindly lent my grandmother the use of her vehicle to go search for him and she visited<br />the hospital and eventually located him there. The families were then evacuated by train to Calcutta; only the women and children though. My grandfather, in that enfeebled condition, walked all the way from Rangoon to Calcutta. He mentioned that on the way he saw lots of people collapse through exhaustion and the others just left them and kept walking. To stop moving was to perish, according to him. </acronym></drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>There is a nice postscript to this story. When one of my uncles eventually passed out of <acronym title="All India Institute of Medical Sciences" AIIMS</acronym  as a doctor, my grandfather tracked down the lady doctor who had saved him, who was then living in Delhi, and took him to her house to tell her that he had vowed to make at least one of his kids into a doctor because of the fact that that lady had saved his life. </p>
<p>I remember even now the place where the shrapnel went through on the right side of his chest and exited from behind his shoulder blade... I used to touch it and ti was always very soft.. like there was just this thin tissue between my finger and the whole. </p>
<p>I have always wanted to write a story about this. Maybe I will :)</p>

<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>I dont know who has written this above chunk about an unknown novel on<br />Nayakars.</p>
<p>I think, it could be "Chandra Vadhana" which has 2 big volumes. It is<br />an excellent story of later Nayaks. A nicely blended love and bravery <br />between Trichy Nayaks and Madurai Nayaks. The story line is a<br />generation after ThirumalaiNayakar. It is during the teens of "Rani <br />Mangammal" who will be addressed as "MuthuNagai" in the story. </p>
<p>I also dont remember the author....but excellent novel to read. </p>

        <p>Dear Arun,</p>
<p>This is touche. </p>
<p>Even the write up is no lesser story, considering the fact these days short story have become so short it is being written in a single line.</p>

To stop moving was to perish, according to him. </drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>There is a nice postscript to this story. When one of my uncles eventually passed out of <acronym title="All India Institute of Medical Sciences" AIIMS</acronym  as a doctor, my grandfather tracked down the lady doctor who had saved him, who was then living in Delhi, and took him to her house to tell her that he had vowed to make at least one of his kids into a doctor because of the fact that that lady had saved his life. </p>
<p>I remember even now the place where the shrapnel went through on the right side of his chest and exited from behind his shoulder blade... I used to touch it and ti was always very soft.. like there was just this thin tissue between my finger and the whole. </p>
<p>I have always wanted to write a story about this. Maybe I will :)</p>

<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>I dont know who has written this above chunk about an unknown novel on<br />Nayakars.</p>
<p>I think, it could be "Chandra Vadhana" which has 2 big volumes. It is<br />an excellent story of later Nayaks. A nicely blended love and bravery <br />between Trichy Nayaks and Madurai Nayaks. The story line is a<br />generation after ThirumalaiNayakar. It is during the teens of "Rani <br />Mangammal" who will be addressed as "MuthuNagai" in the story. </p>
<p>I also dont remember the author....but excellent novel to read. </p>

<p>  Dear Vaithi</p>
<p>  I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire Kalki <br />  but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading <br />  Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th <br />  time. ,</p>
<p>    The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his <br />  Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir( <br />  Kadal Pura)</p>
<p>  Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in SS <br />  its <br />  Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats <br />  their <br />  style. Now I <br />  dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is <br />  the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a <br />  sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.</p>
<p>    One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times <br />  a bit <br />  more than the normal...</p>
<p>  What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the <br />  individuals <br />  concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it <br />  and <br />  later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, I <br />  feel. <br />  (Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir) </p>
<p>  Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type <br />  panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to <br />  finish reading the <br />  book. I dont <br />  deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced <br />  masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to <br />  call for an epic status in thamil is <br />  PS Sandilyans work are more <br />  masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the <br />  will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it will <br />  be roaring success  <br />  The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies... <br />    Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero... <br />    The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy <br />  is not <br />  expecting...<br />  This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero <br />  senja <br />  then the villain becomes a hero.<br />  what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in <br />  kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the same <br />  tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the <br />  same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his aides <br />  guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....<br />    the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a <br />  suspense <br />  note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards <br />  that <br />  suspense and by then that chapter will end... </p>
<p>  Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda poruppu <br />  illaya. Adutha chapterku ilucuradu vera <br />  ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTHHHH<br />  HHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU vera <br />  Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni <br />  anuppiduvungala? Unfortunately the answer is Yes If <br />  that was what they need that was it.</p>
<p>    Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed to <br />  other <br />  authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight <br />  among <br />  themselves.</p>
<p>  Can you please tell me more about our south India history where the <br />  females <br />  played great roles in administering our territories?<br />  Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in shaping <br />  the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not <br />  administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum <br />  greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are <br />  depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding <br />  them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and orchestrad <br />  on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like <br />  Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her tune...<br />    Akilan<br />    Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the <br />  same time <br />  doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more <br />  charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin Mainthan <br />  had 4 <br />  main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the <br />  times <br />  and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<p>  I really feel personally that a little bit of romance in vengaiyin <br />  mainthan <br />  would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that <br />  when <br />  lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to be <br />  away, <br />  chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.<br />    There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of <br />  Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to Irwing <br />  Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the <br />  latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no love <br />  life(physical..)Its just the author chooses to ignore it... <br />  I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo and <br />  rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />    Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should <br />  not <br />  write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura <br />  nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who <br />  seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of <br />  Rajendra is <br />  done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>  Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to go <br />  in <br />  search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would <br />  have read <br />  PS first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have <br />  been <br />  your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing <br />  the same <br />  situation from a different angle.<br />  Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA what <br />  do you say about NN<br />  And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember <br />  neither <br />  the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between <br />  nayakkars <br />  and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really pacy.</p>

<p>    Can you please tell me more about our south India history where the<br />    females<br />    played great roles in administering our territories?<br />    Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in shaping<br />    the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not<br />    administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum<br />    greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are<br />    depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding<br />    them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and orchestrad<br />    on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like<br />    Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her tune...<br />      Akilan<br />      Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the<br />    same time<br />    doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more<br />    charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin Mainthan<br />    had 4<br />    main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the<br />    times<br />    and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<p>    I really feel personally that a little bit of romance in vengaiyin<br />    mainthan<br />    would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that<br />    when<br />    lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to be<br />    away,<br />    chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.<br />      There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of<br />    Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to Irwing<br />    Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the<br />    latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no love<br />    life(physical..)Its just the author chooses to ignore it...<br />    I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo and<br />    rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />      Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should<br />    not<br />    write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura<br />    nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who<br />    seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of<br />    Rajendra is<br />    done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>    Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to go<br />    in<br />    search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would<br />    have read<br />    PS first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have<br />    been<br />    your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing<br />    the same<br />    situation from a different angle.<br />    Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA what<br />    do you say about NN<br />    And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember<br />    neither<br />    the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between<br />    nayakkars<br />    and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really pacy.</p>

<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>I dont know who has written this above chunk about an unknown novel on<br />Nayakars.</p>
<p>I think, it could be "Chandra Vadhana" which has 2 big volumes. It is<br />an excellent story of later Nayaks. A nicely blended love and bravery<br />between Trichy Nayaks and Madurai Nayaks. The story line is a<br />generation after ThirumalaiNayakar. It is during the teens of "Rani <br />Mangammal" who will be addressed as "MuthuNagai" in the story. </p>
<p>I also dont remember the author....but excellent novel to read. </p>

<p>  Dear Vaithi</p>
<p>  I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire Kalki <br />  but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading <br />  Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th <br />  time. ,</p>
<p>    The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his <br />  Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir( <br />  Kadal Pura)</p>
<p>  Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in SS <br />  its <br />  Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats <br />  their <br />  style. Now I <br />  dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is <br />  the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a <br />  sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.</p>
<p>    One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times <br />  a bit <br />  more than the normal...</p>
<p>  What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the <br />  individuals <br />  concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it <br />  and <br />  later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, I <br />  feel. <br />  (Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)</p>
<p>  Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type <br />  panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to <br />  finish reading the <br />  book. I dont <br />  deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced <br />  masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to <br />  call for an epic status in thamil is <br />  PS Sandilyans work are more <br />  masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the <br />  will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it will <br />  be roaring success  <br />  The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...<br />    Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero... <br />    The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy <br />  is not <br />  expecting...<br />  This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero <br />  senja <br />  then the villain becomes a hero.<br />  what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in <br />  kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the same <br />  tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the <br />  same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his aides <br />  guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....<br />    the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a <br />  suspense <br />  note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards <br />  that <br />  suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>

        <p>Hi all</p>
<p>just finished zamindar magan, a short story by kalki</p>
<p>it describes graphically the bombing of rangoon by the japenese during <br />world war 2 and its evacuation.</p>
<p>in rangoon all prisons are opened, all lunatic asuylums are opened and <br />even in the zoo the carnivores are killed and the rest released. he <br />goes on to describe the across the land escape of people in 4 lorries.</p>

<p>  Dear Vaithi</p>
<p>  I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire <br />Kalki <br />  but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading <br />  Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th <br />  time. ,</p>
<p>    The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his <br />  Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir( <br />  Kadal Pura)</p>
<p>  Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in SS <br />  its <br />  Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats <br />  their <br />  style. Now I <br />  dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is <br />  the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a <br />  sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.</p>
<p>    One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times <br />  a bit <br />  more than the normal...</p>
<p>  What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the <br />  individuals <br />  concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it <br />  and <br />  later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, <br />I <br />  feel. <br />  (Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)</p>
<p>  Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type <br />  panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to <br />  finish reading the <br />  book. I dont <br />  deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced <br />  masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to <br />  call for an epic status in thamil is <br />  PS Sandilyans work are more <br />  masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the <br />  will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it <br />will <br />  be roaring success   </p>
<p>  The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...<br />    Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero... <br />    The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy <br />  is not <br />  expecting...<br />  This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero <br />  senja <br />  then the villain becomes a hero.<br />  what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in <br />  kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the same <br />  tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the <br />  same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his aides <br />  guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....<br />    the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a <br />  suspense <br />  note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards <br />  that <br />  suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>
<p>  Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda poruppu <br />  illaya. Adutha chapterku ilucuradu vera </p>
<p>ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTHHHH<br />  HHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU vera<br />  Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni <br />  anuppiduvungala? Unfortunately the answer is Yes If <br />  that was what they need that was it.</p>
<p>    Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed to <br />  other <br />  authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight <br />  among <br />  themselves.</p>
<p>  Can you please tell me more about our south India history where the <br />  females <br />  played great roles in administering our territories?<br />  Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in shaping <br />  the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not <br />  administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum <br />  greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are <br />  depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding <br />  them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and orchestrad <br />  on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like <br />  Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her tune...<br />    Akilan<br />    Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the <br />  same time <br />  doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more <br />  charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin <br />Mainthan <br />  had 4 <br />  main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the <br />  times <br />  and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<p>  I really feel personally that a little bit of romance in vengaiyin <br />  mainthan <br />  would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that <br />  when <br />  lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to be <br />  away, <br />  chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.<br />    There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of <br />  Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to Irwing <br />  Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the <br />  latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no <br />love <br />  life(physical..)Its just the author chooses to ignore it...   <br />  I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo and <br />  rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />    Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should <br />  not <br />  write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura <br />  nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who <br />  seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of <br />  Rajendra is <br />  done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>  Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to <br />go <br />  in <br />  search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would <br />  have read <br />  PS first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have <br />  been <br />  your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing <br />  the same <br />  situation from a different angle.<br />  Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA what <br />  do you say about NN<br />  And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember <br />  neither <br />  the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between <br />  nayakkars <br />  and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really pacy.</p>

<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>I dont know who has written this above chunk about an unknown novel on<br />Nayakars.</p>
<p>I think, it could be "Chandra Vadhana" which has 2 big volumes. It is<br />an excellent story of later Nayaks. A nicely blended love and bravery<br />between Trichy Nayaks and Madurai Nayaks. The story line is a<br />generation after ThirumalaiNayakar. It is during the teens of "Rani <br />Mangammal" who will be addressed as "MuthuNagai" in the story. </p>
<p>I also dont remember the author....but excellent novel to read. </p>

Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero <br />  senja <br />  then the villain becomes a hero.<br />  what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in <br />  kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the same <br />  tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the <br />  same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his aides <br />  guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....<br />    the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a <br />  suspense <br />  note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards <br />  that <br />  suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>
<p>  Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda poruppu <br />  illaya. Adutha chapterku ilucuradu vera <br />  ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTHHHH<br />  HHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU vera<br />  Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni <br />  anuppiduvungala? Unfortunately the answer is Yes If <br />  that was what they need that was it.</p>
<p>    Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed to <br />  other <br />  authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight <br />  among <br />  themselves.</p>
<p>  Can you please tell me more about our south India history where the <br />  females <br />  played great roles in administering our territories?<br />  Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in shaping <br />  the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not <br />  administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum <br />  greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are <br />  depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding <br />  them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and orchestrad <br />  on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like <br />  Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her tune...<br />    Akilan<br />    Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the <br />  same time <br />  doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more <br />  charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin Mainthan <br />  had 4 <br />  main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the <br />  times <br />  and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<p>  I really feel personally that a little bit of romance in vengaiyin <br />  mainthan <br />  would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that <br />  when <br />  lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to be <br />  away, <br />  chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.<br />    There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of <br />  Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to Irwing <br />  Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the <br />  latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no love <br />  life(physical..)Its just the author chooses to ignore it...   <br />  I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo and <br />  rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />    Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should <br />  not <br />  write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura <br />  nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who <br />  seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of <br />  Rajendra is <br />  done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>  Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to go <br />  in <br />  search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would <br />  have read <br />  PS first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have <br />  been <br />  your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing <br />  the same <br />  situation from a different angle.<br />  Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA what <br />  do you say about NN<br />  And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember <br />  neither <br />  the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between <br />  nayakkars <br />  and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really pacy.</p>

          Kalki Vs Sandilyan        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear All<br />Was just going thro old mails there very good discussions on <br />Sandilyan and Kalki between mails 2700-2800<br />Reagrds<br />Sri</p>
<p>Dear Vaithi</p>
<p>I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire Kalki <br />but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading <br />Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th <br />time. ,</p>
<blockquote><p>  The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his <br />Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir( </p></blockquote>
<p>Kadal Pura)</p>
<p>Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in SS <br />its <br />Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats <br />their <br />style. Now I <br />dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is <br />the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a <br />sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.</p>
<blockquote><p>  One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times <br />a bit </p></blockquote>
<p>more than the normal...</p>
<p>What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the <br />individuals <br />concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it <br />and <br />later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, I <br />feel. <br />(Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)</p>
<p>Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type <br />panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to <br />finish reading the <br />book. I dont <br />deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced <br />masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to <br />call for an epic status in thamil is <br />PS Sandilyans work are more <br />masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the <br />will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it will <br />be roaring success   <br />The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...</p>
<blockquote><p>  Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero... <br />  The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy <br />is not </p></blockquote>
<p>expecting...<br />This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero <br />senja <br />then the villain becomes a hero.<br />what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in <br />kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the same <br />tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the <br />same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his aides <br />guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....</p>
<blockquote><p>  the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a <br />suspense </p></blockquote>
<p>note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards <br />that <br />suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>
<p>Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda poruppu <br />illaya. Adutha chapterku ilucuradu vera <br />ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTHHHH<br />HHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU vera<br />Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni <br />anuppiduvungala?

<p>Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the <br />latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no love <br />life(physical..)Its just the author chooses to ignore it...   <br />I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo and <br />rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should <br />not </p></blockquote>
<p>write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura <br />nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who <br />seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of <br />Rajendra is <br />done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to go <br />in <br />search of this book.

      <div class="content">
        <p>The novel I was referreing to, I dont remember whether its Vijayamah <br />dhevi or moongil kottai or neither. But it was not Ranimuththu <br />kurunovel. When I happened to read some of his Rani Muththu kuru <br />novels like "Manjal Nila" etc, I dint have much expectations, so <br />wasn't disappointed.</p>
<p>Sandilyan's Jala Deepam, I felt the novel itself is almost the <br />replica of Kadal puRa. Santilyan avaroda Kadal Pura-la avarE mayangi <br />antha effect-la atha duplicate panni "Jala Deepam" aakittaronnu <br />thoniththu. Any views on this ??!! (Sathyama, Sathya-va Sani Bagavan <br />Uchchilernthu Ukkirama paarthindu irukkuan ninaikkiRen )</p>
<p>Sandilyan has written one social novel rt. "Senbaga thottam"??. I <br />guess it dint have that reach as his historical novel(if I am not <br />wrong). As Akilan and Kalki shined both in historical and social <br />novels, Santilyan dint shine that much it seems. Nothing offensive <br />meant to Santilyan and his fans. Probably I may be ignorant and I may <br />not be knowing too. (Better to put always this type of <br />disclaimers :P )</p>
<p>Akilan's "Chithirappaavai" and "paavai vilakku", u will be so <br />involved and u won't even feel to get distracted even to wipe your <br />eyes though it is moistened and the vision is blurred, but still u <br />continue reading it!!! When we read his novels, he will make us to be <br />the characters of them!!!</p>
<p>Kalki's social novels, I hadn't read anything yet :(</p>

<p>I am also at your side when it comes to YR or KP. But I read YR <br />first. I just experimented by lending the novels to some of my <br />friends and got their opinion. Surprisingly the first novel they read <br />impressed them better. Thats why I enquired Sri whether he read PS or <br />NN first.</p>

        <p>Dear Sathya <br />I do agree with your comments sat   I don't mean its a big crime.. but when I read<br />two or three Sandilyan's in the short span, I felt<br />like skipping many of the pages and skipped by getting<br />bored of the stereotypic comparison.</p>
<p>Azhakiyal description and romantic description are explicit in sandilyan...they are a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  too much If you want to you can sit together as a family and read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  with your mother gran and sister you cant do that with Sandilyans works can you? Sathya we seem to share quite a few common chraectors and books....yavanarani and rohini....bye sri</p>

          Kalki Vs Sandilyan        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Vaithi</p>
<p>I am a big Sandilyan fan I admire Sandilyan as much as i admire Kalki but you have to call a spade a spade if not I wont be reading Yavanarani and Kadal pura for the 7th or 8th time. ,</p>
<blockquote><p>  The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his <br />Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir( Kadal Pura)</p></blockquote>
<p>Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in SS its <br />Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats their <br />style. Now I dont say a hero or main charector has to be the King what I say is the way the storyline goes...the charectors theres always a sanyasi..a kadalkollaikaran...stereotyping is the word.</p>
<blockquote><p>  One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times a bit <br />more than the normal...</p></blockquote>
<p>What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the individuals <br />concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it and <br />later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, I feel. <br />(Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)</p>
<p>Ethavadhu sollanumnu sollrathukkaka 2am ku ukarnthu yarum type panrathu kidayathu especially if you have stayed up till 2 am to finish reading the book. I dont deny that Sandilyan has a style and pace and has produced masterpieces I wont call them epics the only one in my opinion to call for an epic status in thamil is PS Sandilyans work are more masala Infact I have dreamed to see if someone would have the will to make movies or seriala of yavanarani and kadalpura....it will be roaring success  The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...</p>
<blockquote><p>  Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero... <br />  The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy is not <br />expecting...</p></blockquote>
<p>This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero senja <br />then the villain becomes a hero.<br />what i meant is sterotyping there is no room for suspense like in kadalpura be it kangadevan or balavarman ilayapallavan uses the same tactic acting like a drunkard and kanchana nad manjalalaki do the same...getting angry and irritated and the hero keeps all his aides guessing and treats them like imbeciles......sterotyping.....</p>
<blockquote><p>  the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a suspense <br />note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards that </p></blockquote>
<p>suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>
<p>Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda poruppu illaya. Adutha chapterku ilucuradu vera ILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCRRRRRRAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUU vera<br />Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni anuppiduvungala? Unfortunately the answer is Yes If that was what they need that was it.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed to other <br />authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight among </p></blockquote>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>Can you please tell me more about our south India history where the females <br />played great roles in administering our territories?<br />Kundavai though was not a king or queen had a great role in shaping the greatness of chola kingdom.....and greatness is not administrating only ...murathal puliyai adithu thurathinalum greatness than....what I am saying is SSandilyans Heroines are depected as women of valour but there is always a man guiding them...even alli even yavana rani they are all guided and orchestrad on the contrary Kalkis charectors have amind of their own...like Poongulali or kundavai...nandhini she makes men dance to her tune...</p>
<blockquote><p>  Akilan<br />  Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the same time <br />doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more </p></blockquote>
<p>charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin Mainthan had 4 <br />main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the times <br />and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<p>I really feel personally that a little bit of romance in vengaiyin mainthan <br />would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that when <br />lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to be away, <br />chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.</p>
<blockquote><p>  There are people who have different ways of writing..the stle of Erich Segal,Alistair Maclean and Jeffrey archers different to Irwing Wallace and Sidney sheldon that doesnt mean the charectors in the latters books arre love machines and the previous series have no love life(physical..)Its just the author chooses to ignore it... <br />I Still think one of the greatest depiction of Romance is Ialngo and rohinis meeting near the sarakondrai maram.....   Vikraman:<br />  Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should not <br />write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura </p></blockquote>
<p>nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who <br />seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of Rajendra is <br />done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to go in <br />search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would have read <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have been <br />your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing the same <br />situation from a different angle.<br />Please read the book and Ill wait for your opinion ...PAVITHRA what do you say about NN<br />And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember neither <br />the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between nayakkars <br />and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really pacy.</acronym></p>

        <p></p>
<blockquote><p>  I dont remember that the hero karikalan falls for 2<br />heroines in 'Mannan <br />  Magal' That was also a great master piece. You can<br />compare it <br />  with 'Vengaiyin mainthan' That is also description<br />of Rajendra Chola. More <br />  over descriptions of two heroines is not a big<br />crime. </p></blockquote>
<p>sat   I don't mean its a big crime.. but when I read<br />two or three Sandilyan's in the short span, I felt<br />like skipping many of the pages and skipped by getting<br />bored of the stereotypic comparison.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Even in PS Kalki <br />  compares vanathi vs poonguzhali and also vanathi vs<br />kunthavai. Description <br />  and comparison of characteristics of two people only<br />adds to the character. </p></blockquote>
<p>sat   What are being compared and how they are<br />compared also matter a lot. In Sandilyan's, mostly the<br />comparison would be of azhakiyal. In PS, vanathi and<br />poonguzhali comparison will be mostly of their<br />characters, attitude etc. Konjam bayantha character<br />Vanathi, thunichchalaana characters Ponguzhaliyodayum,<br />koodavE irukkara Kundhavaiyodayum compare panrathu, as<br />u say it enhanced the characters. </p>
<p>But as i said, sandilyan's comparison perumpaalum<br />azhagiyal saarnthathaagavE irukkum. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Your remarks about novels, the name not worth<br />remembering is cruel. Some <br />  novels go that way also, I think you refer to<br />moongil kottai. But the <br />  standard he set for himself is what made you think<br />that way. Sollarathai <br />  sollitu adikka varathenu sonna eppadi?</p></blockquote>
<p>sat   I am not blaming Sandilyan's all novels(naan<br />padichcathum konjam thaan :P). In fact the historical<br />novel which I read very first and which made me to be<br />interested in historical novels and history (school<br />history lessons ellam just for exams thaan :P ) is of<br />Sandilyan only. Yavana Rani!! Many say Kadal PuRa is<br />his master piece. Ithula naanum Sri side. According to<br />me too, its Yavana Rani!!</p>
<blockquote><p>  Regarding Romance, that is part of life. In a novel<br />with 50 chapters, 4 <br />  chapters of romance as sandilyan himself says is not<br />crime. </p></blockquote>
<p>sat   Four chapters of romance is fine... But if the<br />same is in every fourth chapter ?!!!! (AdikkavE<br />vanthuduvinga nenaikkiren, joot :) )</p>
<p>What is normal romantic description and whats not is<br />upto the individuals <br />concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his<br />books, enjoy it and <br />later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo<br />against romance, I feel. <br />(Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)</p>
<p>sat   padikkaamalE toooooooo romantic-nu eppadi solla<br />mudiyum ;) :P</p>
<p>I really feel personally that a little bit of romance<br />in vengaiyin mainthan <br />would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot<br />agree that when <br />lovers meet, that too after one has been away or<br />rather forced to be away, <br />chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between<br />them.</p>
<p>sat   In Vengaiyin Mainthan, the emotions of each<br />persons has been handled so neat..<br />Mainly, Akilan had very well described the feeling of<br />such an emotional and eccentric character Rohanaththu<br />Ilvarasi. <br />The way she irritates the Hero, the way she makes him<br />feet pity for her later, the way she pities and curses<br />him and <br />herself and ...

<p>In one kuru-novel of Sandilyan, even the hero is an elder Arabian traveler.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in SS its <br />  Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats their <br />  style.</p></blockquote>
<p>But still Vandiya Thevan and Paranjothi are historical characters, while<br />GENERALLY Sandilyan's heroes are karpanai upathalapathi kathaapathirangal<br />but for exceptions like Ilaya Pallavan, Veerapandiyan etc. (Same side goal!)</p>

<p>  Thanks Mr.Karthik, I was really desperate to read these 2 novels which I <br />  happened to read really many years before, I forgot its names. Thanks for <br />  reminding them.</p>
<p>  Moreover, regarding your opinion on Vijayanagar, I agree it was bhamini <br />  sultans who destroyed the empire. But after reading 'Vetri thirunagar' I <br />  feel they alone were not responsible for that.</p>

<p>Ms. Prathiba, I really feel you have a biased opinion. When you have <br />already given the judgement that <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is the best, then no point in analysing <br />other novels isn't it? Be fair.</acronym></p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sridhar,</p>
<blockquote><p>  Sandilyan has produced epics like Yavanarani and Kadal pura ,kannimaadam<br />(was it sandilyan|) rjamuthirai and rajaperigai...</p>
<p>  but his charectorisation and scenarios are stereotyped..(I just recently <br />read Yavanarani and Kadal pura..I personally like YavanaRani I should Say.</p>
<p>  The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his <br />Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir( Kadal Pura)</p></blockquote>
<p>Comeon Mr.Sridhar, even in PS, the hero is Vanthiya Devan and in SS its <br />Paranjothi. The author sees the situation through their eyes. Thats their <br />style.</p>
<blockquote><p>  One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times a bit <br />more than the normal...</p></blockquote>
<p>What is normal romantic description and whats not is upto the individuals <br />concerned. But to be honest, I feel people read his books, enjoy it and <br />later comment it as too romantic. Its just a taboo against romance, I feel. <br />(Ethavathu thakkarathuna koncham pathu seiyungo sir)</p>
<blockquote><p>  The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...<br />  Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero... <br />  The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy is not <br />expecting...</p></blockquote>
<p>This is too general a statement. Villain ethirpakkaramathiri hero senja <br />then the villain becomes a hero.</p>
<blockquote><p>  the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a suspense <br />note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working towards that </p></blockquote>
<p>suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>
<p>Doctor sir, adutha chapterku ungalai izhukkarathum authoroda poruppu illaya. <br />Ungal clientsai first sittingleye finalise panni anuppiduvungala?</p>
<blockquote><p>  Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed to other <br />authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to fight among </p></blockquote>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>Can you please tell me more about our south India history where the females <br />played great roles in administering our territories?</p>
<blockquote><p>  Akilan<br />  Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the same time <br />doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more </p></blockquote>
<p>charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin Mainthan had 4 <br />main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and the times <br />and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<p>I really feel personally that a little bit of romance in vengaiyin mainthan <br />would have added flavour to the novel. I really cannot agree that when <br />lovers meet, that too after one has been away or rather forced to be away, <br />chatting and keeping a distance of a metre between them.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Vikraman:<br />  Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should not <br />write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura </p></blockquote>
<p>nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who <br />seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of Rajendra is <br />done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<p>Sir, I have not read this novel. But your comment has forced me to go in <br />search of this book. Just imagine, and Iam assured that you would have read <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  first. Had you read the nandhipura nayagi first what would have been <br />your opinion about vanathi and kunthavai? I really like analysing the same <br />situation from a different angle.</acronym></p>
<p>And there is one more novel which was also good, sorry I remember neither <br />the name of the book nor the author, but its was a story between nayakkars <br />and the cholas(after thirumalai nayakkar).That was also really pacy.</p>
<p>Expecting a hot reply<br />Vaidy</p>

        <p></p>
<blockquote><p>  In most of his novels, there would be always two heroins, <br />  always comparison about their beauty, which would also always be <br />  contrasting, like ponnira koondhal/kaarmega vaNNa koondhal, neela <br />  nayanangaL/karunthiratchai kan manigaL etc... and the hero would <br />  always love both the beauties!!</p></blockquote>
<p>I dont remember that the hero karikalan falls for 2 heroines in 'Mannan <br />Magal' That was also a great master piece. You can compare it <br />with 'Vengaiyin mainthan' That is also description of Rajendra Chola. More <br />over descriptions of two heroines is not a big crime. Even in PS Kalki <br />compares vanathi vs poonguzhali and also vanathi vs kunthavai. Description <br />and comparison of characteristics of two people only adds to the character. <br />When a person has written more than 30 novels, be fair to him also.</p>
<blockquote><p>But some of his novels<br />  (forgot the name, not that worth to remember also:P, Yaarum adikka <br />  varaathinga!! ) he has dealt mostly of romance. While reading them, I <br />  was thinking the novel would be worth atleast for the well described <br />  war sequence. Alas! that went on hardly 5-10 pages with nothing great <br />  in it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your remarks about novels, the name not worth remembering is cruel. Some <br />novels go that way also, I think you refer to moongil kottai. But the <br />standard he set for himself is what made you think that way. Sollarathai <br />sollitu adikka varathenu sonna eppadi?</p>
<p>Regarding Romance, that is part of life. In a novel with 50 chapters, 4 <br />chapters of romance as sandilyan himself says is not crime. Infact I feel <br />that's what makes the novel lively. Right from kalidasa to Bharathi, <br />romance has its place.</p>

        <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am a new member of this group and have avidly followed the goings<br />here for some time now. Intha mathiri oru group with this much amount<br />of interaction irukkaratha paarthu santhoshama irukku.</p>
<p>This thread reminded me of another thread in forum hub which was<br />forwarded by my colleague. Not quite the same topics, but<br />renduthalayume there are two categories. One who is percieved to be an<br />ilakkiyavaathi and the other a popular author. </p>

<p>  That was interesting.<br />  I have read almost all of Sandilyans novels as well like Karthikeyan<br />said yes Kalki has only written 3 historical novels and sandilyan</p></blockquote>
<p>numerous but I dont think you can take into account all of his<br />Ranimuthu kurunovels...</p>
<blockquote><p>  Sandilyan<br />  Sandilyan has produced epics like Yavanarani and Kadal pura<br />,kannimaadam(was it sandilyan|) rjamuthirai and rajaperigai...</p>
<p>  but his charectorisation and scenarios are stereotyped..(I just<br />recently read Yavanarani and Kadal pura..I personally like YavanaRani</p></blockquote>
<p>I should Say.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The Hero is always a Upathalapathi,...has a foreigner as his<br />Adimai..Hippalas(Yavanarani) Moor samath(Vijayamahadevi)...Amir( Kadal</p></blockquote>
<p>Pura)</p>
<blockquote><p>  One or more Heroines...Explicit romatintic descriptions some times a<br />bit more than the normal...</p>
<p>  The villains are all vadikattuna porukkis like tamil movies...</p>
<p>  Always the villains daughter or valarppupenn falls for the hero...</p>
<p>  The hero always fakes he is faltering and hits back when the enemy<br />is not expecting...</p>
<p>  I agree his war scenarios are good especially the final battle plan<br />for karikalan in Yavanarani or the kadal pors in Kadal Pura...He even</p></blockquote>
<p>sketches the Clives years in Rajaperigai very well.but they tend to be<br />stereotyped....</p>
<blockquote><p>  the other irritating bit in his style is ending a chapter in a<br />suspense note and starting the next chapter in retrospect and working</p></blockquote>
<p>towards that suspense and by then that chapter will end...</p>
<blockquote><p>  Sandilyans heros carry the story in their shoulders as opposed to<br />other authors...the heroines are just for beauty and sometimes to</p></blockquote>
<p>fight among themselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>  In my opinion his best is YavanaRani.</p>
<p>  Akilan<br />  Soft romance and a good storyline keeps up the suspense and the same<br />time doesnt bore you.The charectorisation is more like kalki with more</p></blockquote>
<p>charectors sharing the burden of the story like eg Vengaiyin Mainthan<br />had 4 main charectors Ilango.Arulmozhi,Rohini and Rajendra Chola and<br />the times and turmoils are well illustarted.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Vikraman:<br />  Personal opinion but he is an excellent example of how one should<br />not write sequels he tarnishes all of kalkis charectors in Nandhipura</p></blockquote>
<p>nayagi.Vanathi is a jeaulos person,Kundavai is a kodungol arakki who<br />seperates the island girl from arulmozhi,even the conception of<br />Rajendra is done as a confusion(well vanathi in sithapiramai etc)</p>
<blockquote><p>  Kovi Manisegaran:<br />  Just one Chola Nila very good pace</p>
<p>  .............................<br />  Kanchikathiravan Cant remember the author but again very nice pace<br />about mahendrapallava and simhavisnu period.</p>
<p>  Sujatha<br />  A change from his Iyandras and Vasanth and Ganesh in Ratham Ore<br />Niram...a very interesting peice of histroric novel set in the</p></blockquote>
<p>backdrop of the sepoy mutiny etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Cant say the same for his half written Kanthalur vasanthakumaran<br />kathai...</p>
<p>  So Sandilyan is good but not in the same genre as Kalki</p>

<p>I would like to add Sreevenugopalan to this list.<br />Two of his novels 'Thiruvarangan Ula' and 'Madura Vijayam' are well written. The former depicting the plight of Srirangam idol and the start of Muslim rule in TN, while the latter deals with the overthrow of the Muslim rule by Vijayanagar and restoring of the idol to Srirangam temple, with nice romance. Gr8 read. I read another of his book(Mokavlalli thoothu) recently, not as good as these two.</p>

<p>I would like to add Sreevenugopalan to this list.<br />Two of his novels 'Thiruvarangan Ula' and 'Madura Vijayam' are well written. The former depicting the plight of Srirangam idol and the start of Muslim rule in TN, while the latter deals with the overthrow of the Muslim rule by Vijayanagar and restoring of the idol to Srirangam temple, with nice romance. Gr8 read. I read another of his book(Mokavlalli thoothu) recently, not as good as these two.</p>

        <p>I'm feeling guilty that I've not read as much like the others or remember them. But what do people think of Maguda Nila by Mu. Mehta?<br />( I may have a biased opinion becos I will never accept that anything can equal PS....<br />Sujatha is a very good writer but again of a very different genre. He can be compared to Jeffrey Archer when you consider his short stories....)</p>
