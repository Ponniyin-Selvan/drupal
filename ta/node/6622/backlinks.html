</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I was Just watching Koffee with Anu on Vijay TV - 2 very good singers Deepan<br />Chakravarthi and Manicka Vinayagam.</p>
<p>Manicka Vinayagam was talking about his lineage. He mentioned that his<br />ancestor had taught dance to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's daughter Kundavai and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had honoured<br />them with land etc during Kundavai's arangetram and it is there in<br />inscriptions. It was really nice to listen to it. I was transported back in<br />time and almost instantly visualized a setting such as that.</acronym></p>
<p>As I thought about it, I realized that it was quite a link, that I was<br />watching some one who was actually connected with <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , his family and the<br />era, a straight lineage of 1000+ years.</acronym></p>

        <p>I have a family tree chart, where I can trace up about 8 nodes -<br />equivalent to 8 generations. I am not sure about the authenticity, but<br />chanced upon the chart that my grandfather had.</p>
<p>Going back to 10th century is so interesting. I can hardly imagine the<br />excitement. I bet the lineage would be through the word of mouth.</p>

<p>  Is there anything to indicate that women were restrained from certain<br />  activities those days? Were there restrictions on women of royal<br />families<br />  from doing certain things?</p>
<p>  I am asking this more out of factual ignorance. The impression I got<br />from<br />  Kalki's books + certain other bits &amp; accounts of westerners who had<br />  accounted the social life of those times, is that women were<br />generally free<br />  and were not socially oppressed (as they were later on). I also felt<br />that<br />  they were more secure then. A character like Poonkuyali travels<br />freely where<br />  ever she pleases and women generally seem to have had a say on a lot of<br />  matters.</p>
<p>  Look forward to your knowledge (and others too) on this.</p>

        <p>Yes I agree, we have a family tree too tracing back 200 years, one of my relatives did lot of research on that. We still debate that parts of it are assumptions though. 1000 years..this man is definitely spinning some reels :))</p>

<p>I share your horor. I dont think a woman needs to prove anything to anyone.The concept of Karpukkarasis is ridiculous.

<p>I just came back from Seattle attending a technical conference with <br />Microsoft. I am part of expanding a technical community related to MS <br />Software and offered to do that in India.

Since we are talking about <br />women -<br />      royal women generally were not allowed to engage in arts or any <br />  other<br />      active profession, they sponsored art and artisans which is a<br />      different story altogether but being an active singer/dancer, <br />no -<br />      remember Mahendra Pallava's extensive justification on his son <br />not<br />      marrying Sivakami as her art would then be lost to the world?</p>
<p>      Royal women were expected to be accepting of their husbands <br />having<br />      multiple wives/concubines (unlike the Mahabharat where it goes <br />  both<br />      ways!) and Sati was glorified also - even Kundavi presents Sati<br />      committed by her ancestors as a great reason while declaring <br />her <br />  love<br />      for VD? RRJ's mother herself historically committed Sati while<br />      nursing an infant.</p>
<p>      To me all this really does not add up to any great freedom. <br />There<br />      were great women like Sembian Madhevi who used their influence, <br />  money<br />      to further religious causes. But the average royal woman still <br />  had to<br />      abide by all these rules. Kalki himself was a very odd mix of<br />      conservatism and progressiveness - Kalyani, Poonguzhali and <br />  Savitri<br />      on one hand with Vanavan madhevi, Vaanadhi and other husband<br />      worshipping women on the other.</p>

        <p>Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym , I received a somewhat hurt, angry response to this <br />personally, from an elderly member - accusing me of not <br />respecting 'karpukkarasis' and those who had consented to voluntary <br />suicide by fire with their spouses. I put it down to generation gap, <br />and all respects to the elderly member but this is really not an <br />issue of debate in modern times, it is much beyond that.</acronym></p>
<p>I just came back from Seattle attending a technical conference with <br />Microsoft. I am part of expanding a technical community related to MS <br />Software and offered to do that in India. I was asked by a group of <br />white people if a woman in leadership roles would be acceptable in <br />India. This is 21st century and I was surprised and very saddened by <br />the question. I told them that there are more women statistically in <br />technology in India than in US and several are in very senior <br />positoins including CIOs. But looking at such emails I feel they had <br />a point. Yes we are not even progressed enough to condemn sati <br />unequivocally, are we? What has sati has to do with virtue by the <br />way? It takes more courage to live than to die and if it was indeed <br />in the cause of love, how is it that no man died in the cause of his <br />love/wife? Or as the great Mahakavi said 'karpai podhuvil vaippom'?</p>
<p>I really did not mean to sidetrack the thread but I just felt very <br />sad and compelled to write. Sincere apologies.</p>

<p>      Sandeep, am no history expert but based on Kalki's writing <br />and <br />  very<br />      generic information - there were LOT of restrictions royal <br />family<br />      people had, both men and women. Since we are talking about <br />women -<br />      royal women generally were not allowed to engage in arts or any <br />  other<br />      active profession, they sponsored art and artisans which is a<br />      different story altogether but being an active singer/dancer, <br />no -<br />      remember Mahendra Pallava's extensive justification on his son <br />not<br />      marrying Sivakami as her art would then be lost to the world?</p>
<p>      Royal women were expected to be accepting of their husbands <br />having<br />      multiple wives/concubines (unlike the Mahabharat where it goes <br />  both<br />      ways!) and Sati was glorified also - even Kundavi presents Sati<br />      committed by her ancestors as a great reason while declaring <br />her <br />  love<br />      for VD? RRJ's mother herself historically committed Sati while<br />      nursing an infant.</p>
<p>      To me all this really does not add up to any great freedom. <br />There<br />      were great women like Sembian Madhevi who used their influence, <br />  money<br />      to further religious causes. But the average royal woman still <br />  had to<br />      abide by all these rules. Kalki himself was a very odd mix of<br />      conservatism and progressiveness - Kalyani, Poonguzhali and <br />  Savitri<br />      on one hand with Vanavan madhevi, Vaanadhi and other husband<br />      worshipping women on the other.</p>

<p>Wouldnt that be more of a 20th century view than a factual 10th century<br />evidence? I mean I was wondering if there was any factual account of the<br />status enjoyed by common women of that period or before. Besides like you<br />said, royal family people, both men and women, have always had<br />restrictions.The old vedic dharma certainly had a more equality than the<br />post mugal period. Some one wanting to commit sati for what ever reason is<br />different from someone being forced to commit - not that I am or would like<br />to justify either.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Sandeep, am no history expert but based on Kalki's writing and very<br />  generic information - there were LOT of restrictions royal family<br />  people had, both men and women. Since we are talking about women -<br />  royal women generally were not allowed to engage in arts or any other<br />  active profession, they sponsored art and artisans which is a<br />  different story altogether but being an active singer/dancer, no -<br />  remember Mahendra Pallava's extensive justification on his son not<br />  marrying Sivakami as her art would then be lost to the world?</p>
<p>  Royal women were expected to be accepting of their husbands having<br />  multiple wives/concubines (unlike the Mahabharat where it goes both<br />  ways!) and Sati was glorified also - even Kundavi presents Sati<br />  committed by her ancestors as a great reason while declaring her love<br />  for VD? RRJ's mother herself historically committed Sati while<br />  nursing an infant.</p>
<p>  To me all this really does not add up to any great freedom. There<br />  were great women like Sembian Madhevi who used their influence, money<br />  to further religious causes. But the average royal woman still had to<br />  abide by all these rules. Kalki himself was a very odd mix of<br />  conservatism and progressiveness - Kalyani, Poonguzhali and Savitri<br />  on one hand with Vanavan madhevi, Vaanadhi and other husband<br />  worshipping women on the other.</p>

<p>    Hi Venketesh</p>
<p>    Is there anything to indicate that women were restrained from<br />  certain<br />    activities those days? Were there restrictions on women of royal<br />  families<br />    from doing certain things?</p>
<p>    I am asking this more out of factual ignorance. The impression I<br />  got from<br />    Kalki's books + certain other bits &amp; accounts of westerners who had<br />    accounted the social life of those times, is that women were<br />  generally free<br />    and were not socially oppressed (as they were later on). I also<br />  felt that<br />    they were more secure then. A character like Poonkuyali travels<br />  freely where<br />    ever she pleases and women generally seem to have had a say on a<br />  lot of<br />    matters.</p>
<p>    Look forward to your knowledge (and others too) on this.</p>

        <p>SPs, very good to know, thank you!! Are there any references to</p>
<p>a. Royal family members learning dance/music or any other art form, <br />am sure they would have considered that worthy of recording.</p>
<p>b. Dance being not practiced as a profession among elite people <br />really did not mean it was not respected, it very much was just that <br />people who are professionals were not considered 'family type'. From <br />what I know the dancers who were dedicated to God/profession (a'ala <br />Sivakami towards end of novel) were supposedly also the king's <br />concubines. Am not sure about Chola kings specifically but <br />Krishnadevaraya one of the great art patrons did have a lot of <br />dancers among his women.</p>

<p>        Royal women were expected to be accepting of their husbands <br />    having <br />        multiple wives/concubines (unlike the Mahabharat where it <br />goes <br />    both <br />        ways!) and Sati was glorified also - even Kundavi presents <br />  Sati <br />        committed by her ancestors as a great reason while declaring <br />  her <br />      love <br />        for VD? RRJ's mother herself historically committed Sati <br />while <br />        nursing an infant. </p>
<p>        To me all this really does not add up to any great freedom. <br />  There <br />        were great women like Sembian Madhevi who used their <br />  influence, <br />      money <br />        to further religious causes.

Kalki himself was a very odd mix of <br />        conservatism and progressiveness - Kalyani, Poonguzhali and <br />    Savitri <br />        on one hand with Vanavan madhevi, Vaanadhi and other husband <br />        worshipping women on the other. </p>
<p>        It would be interesting to know really though if this <br />singer's <br />        ancestor taught dance to Kundavi or was a dance teacher <br />        sponsored /supported by Kundavi, am guessing the latter <br />sounds <br />    lot <br />        more believable.</p>

        <p>Venkat, I agree 100% on all that you say. I don't know this singer <br />very much so do not want to take off on him. If someone I don't know <br />said this I would think without hesitation that he is making up <br />something to show off. Kundavi dancing and having someone teach her, <br />really probably he was inspired by Vyjayanthi mala playing Kundavi, <br />not the real one :)))</p>
<p>It is 100% true that Rukmini Arundale made Bharatham acceptable to <br />masses and conservative middle classes. I am reminded of the oft <br />repeated Thillana Mohanambal dialogue likening sathirattam to the <br />world's oldest profession, that was how it really was.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know really though if this singer's <br />ancestor taught dance to Kundavi or was a dance teacher <br />sponsored /supported by Kundavi, am guessing the latter sounds lot <br />more believable.</p>

          RRC link unexpectedly on Vijay TV        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Well, if some one has access to Manicka Vinayagam, it might be worth<br />discussing it with him. The other thing is his father is (or was) a very<br />reputed dancer and dance teacher who has taught dance to many famous dancers<br />like Padmini etc.</p>
<p>I say 'it might be worth discussing with him' because if he had said it on<br />TV, he might be having some facts and it might be worth authenticating such<br />links. He seemed like a nice bloke who sure has a tremendous voice no doubt.</p>

<p>very nice indeed.</p>
<p>not even the royal families of tamilnadu are able to trace their <br />liniage so much back<br />but its nice to find your roots.<br />i know the feling. last week there was an article on baskara <br />sethupathy in hindu by s. muthiah<br /><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/mp/2008/11/17/stories/2008111751020500.htm" title="http://www.thehindu.com/mp/2008/11/17/stories/2008111751020500.htm">http://www.thehindu.com/mp/2008/11/17/stories/2008111751020500.htm</a></p>
<p>in that he mentions that a financier family had the titles to the <br />kingdom of ramnad for the loans he had taken.<br />the family was mine.<br />rudner and west describe it more in their book, but muthiah just <br />says the family took over the kindom as settlement.</p>
<p>its a moral issue to be debated whether a kingdom can be pledged but <br />then i am only talking about the issue of tracing one's roots.</p>
