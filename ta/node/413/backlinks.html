        <p>4.May I add another point. nandhini was created just to add support to Kundavai character. In a plot where there is real no hero/heroine Vs Villain, when a plot focus on more around situations rather than characters, it imperative to create pairs of characters. <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VVD</acronym -Alwarkadiyan, Aditya-Rajaraja, Kundavai &amp; her shadow Vanadi- Nandhini, Aniruddha-Paluvetta raiyar, Pathibendran- Kandamaran, many opposing minor characters. If you write a story with just Kundavai and her shadow Vanadi, it will be a drab Kundavai pampering <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , teasing Vanadi, consulting the Kudanthai astrolgers, discussing religion with Sembiyan madevi. Kundavai character will lose its importance. So Nandhini was created by Kalki to highlight Kundavai. <br />regards<br />sriraman.p.s.</acronym></p>

<p>          but when we analyse the fictional charecters created by <br />kalki <br />  we<br />      see<br />          he was more at ease with them.he was able to go into their <br />  hearts<br />      and<br />          speak for them. even a minor charecter like manimekalai <br />comes <br />  out<br />      with<br />          flying colours. pungkuzhali, senthan amudhan,maran,<br />  karuthiruman<br />      all<br />          are full of life ,like real charecters we see in everyday <br />  life.</p>

<p>alexander dumas<br />Alexandre Dumas, p?re, was a French writer, best known for his <br />numerous historical novels of high adventure which have made him one <br />of the most widely read French authors in the world.<br />at age of 28 he participated in the revolution that ousted King <br />Charles X ( so much like kalki)<br />a trivia about his birth was that his grand mother was a negro slave. <br />he was thus denied a burial with voltaire or hugo in pantheon of <br />paris. as late as 2002 was his body moved.<br />, </p>

<blockquote><p>  Even the<br />    first scene where our hero Vandhiyathevan rides along the river <br />  Ponni is<br />    similar to D'Artagnan riding his funny looking horse in the first <br />  scene of 3 musketeers.</p>
<p>  Hi Rahul,</p>
<p>  if I remember right d'artagnan was also carrying a letter that he <br />lost<br />  just like vanthiyathevan.<br />  (I think vanthiyathevan rides on the bank of kaveri/ ponni much <br />later)</p>
<p>  in count of monte cristo there is a prison scene where one charecter <br />  reveals a secret to his neighbour.<br />  a character called Abb? Faria ? Italian priest and sage; befriends <br />  Edmond while both are prisoners in the Chateau d'If, and reveals the <br />  secret of Monte Cristo to Edmond( the hero) so much like <br />karuthiruman <br />  and senthan amudhan.</p>
<p>  and nandini and milady had much in common</p>
<p>  beautiful( hauntingly so), many charecters fall for her, and she has <br />a <br />  secret.</p>
<p>  venketesh</p>
<p>    Also the scene where Vandhiyathevan takes on Arulmozhi without <br />  knowing who<br />    he is, is similar to D'Artagnan taking on each of the 3 Musketeers <br />  without<br />    knowing who they are.</p>
<p>    These are small instances but i think the major portion of <br />  Nandhini's<br />    character is too close to Milady De Winter. Remember everybody who <br />  read 3<br />    Musketters at one stage or the other fell in love with Milady, <br />even <br />  when she<br />    is about to be executed Athos still loves her. Im sure every body <br />  (men folk<br />    only ;) ) who read PS must have fascinated by Nandhini in a <br />similar <br />  fashion.<br />    Especially the way Kalki describes her during the night, its <br />  awesome!!</p>
<p>    Before comparing the 2 great authors letrs understand that Dumas <br />was <br />  never<br />    under any pressure while writing 3 Musketeers. Kalki had to <br />deliver <br />  every<br />    week! Infact it is these errors who make the novel and man more <br />  fascinating.</p>

<blockquote><p>  first scene where our hero Vandhiyathevan rides along the river <br />Ponni is<br />  similar to D'Artagnan riding his funny looking horse in the first <br />scene of 3 musketeers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hi Rahul,</p>
<p>if I remember right d'artagnan was also carrying a letter that he lost<br />just like vanthiyathevan.<br />(I think vanthiyathevan rides on the bank of kaveri/ ponni much later)</p>
<p>in count of monte cristo there is a prison scene where one charecter <br />reveals a secret to his neighbour.<br />a character called Abb? Faria ? Italian priest and sage; befriends <br />Edmond while both are prisoners in the Chateau d'If, and reveals the <br />secret of Monte Cristo to Edmond( the hero) so much like karuthiruman <br />and senthan amudhan.</p>
<p>and nandini and milady had much in common</p>
<p>beautiful( hauntingly so), many charecters fall for her, and she has a <br />secret.</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<blockquote><p>  Also the scene where Vandhiyathevan takes on Arulmozhi without <br />knowing who<br />  he is, is similar to D'Artagnan taking on each of the 3 Musketeers <br />without<br />  knowing who they are.</p>
<p>  These are small instances but i think the major portion of <br />Nandhini's<br />  character is too close to Milady De Winter. Remember everybody who <br />read 3<br />  Musketters at one stage or the other fell in love with Milady, even <br />when she<br />  is about to be executed Athos still loves her. Im sure every body <br />(men folk<br />  only ;) ) who read PS must have fascinated by Nandhini in a similar <br />fashion.<br />  Especially the way Kalki describes her during the night, its <br />awesome!!</p>
<p>  Before comparing the 2 great authors letrs understand that Dumas was <br />never<br />  under any pressure while writing 3 Musketeers. Kalki had to deliver <br />every<br />  week! Infact it is these errors who make the novel and man more <br />fascinating.</p>
<p>  Who wants to discuss about some 3 drunken idiots from France <br />fighting a<br />  priest wearing a red robe or about a stupid French queen loosing her <br />jewels<br />  in the Buckingham palace? PS is thousand times more complicated and<br />  fascinating.</p>

<p>    that scene was totally uncalled for as nandini never betrayed<br />    verapandyan. but it must have been dumas's influence that made <br />kalki<br />    write it.</p>

<p>      Great answers, MrVenketesh. Im also of the opinion that Nandhini <br />was<br />    added<br />      as a sex siren. We all know about the similarities between <br />Alexander<br />    Dumas<br />      and Kalki. Kalki's Nandhini has a lot of similarities with <br />Dumas'<br />    Milady De<br />      Winter (pardon me if i got the spelling wrong) of Three <br />Musketeers..<br />    Even<br />      the description of Nandhini by Kalki is similar to Dumas's<br />    description of<br />      Milady. Milady was also described by Dumas as an incredible <br />beauty<br />    on whom<br />      anybody who set his eyes would fall in love (D'Artagnan in the <br />ship<br />    to<br />      England). There is a similar situation with our hero <br />Vandhiyethevan<br />    becoming<br />      speechless on seeing Nandhini.<br />      Nandhini did not have a Fleur De Lis but the event of Karikalan<br />    (lets not<br />      call him Aditya, Karikalan is more heroic) killing the pandya in <br />the<br />      presence of Nandhini is probably Kalki's version of Fleur De <br />Lis.</p>
<p>      Nandhini was probably more glamorised to increase the readership<br />    circle.<br />      Probably the concept of "poison inside a beauty" was exciting to <br />the<br />    youth<br />      of those days (it is still exciting now ;) ;)</p>
<p>      Wondeful thread, hope we get more in this subject.</p>
<p>      BTW before somebody crucifies me for talking about Dumas, let me<br />    make it<br />      clear that I strongly believe Kalki was way superior to Dumas in<br />      characterisation.</p>

<p>Not much difference Rahul<br />The Count of Monte Cristo was originally published in the Journal des <br />D?bats in eighteen parts. Publication ran from August 28, 1844 through <br />January, 1846. Complete versions of the novel in the original French <br />were published throughout the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The Three Musketeers was also first published in serial form in the <br />magazine Le Si?cle between March and July 1844</p>

<p>        but when we analyse the fictional charecters created by kalki <br />we<br />    see<br />        he was more at ease with them.he was able to go into their <br />hearts<br />    and<br />        speak for them. even a minor charecter like manimekalai comes <br />out<br />    with<br />        flying colours. pungkuzhali, senthan amudhan,maran,<br />karuthiruman<br />    all<br />        are full of life ,like real charecters we see in everyday <br />life.</p>

        <p>hi rahul,</p>
<p>fascinating comparison. i only have vague rememberance of 3 Muskateers, i think i have read it to see the similarity. </p>
<p>but as for me, the one book i most liked from Dumas writing, The count of Monte Cristo never had <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  had on me.(Am i missing the whole point here).</p>

<p>There are lots of similarities between Dumas and Kalki. I think this is a well known fact amongst the knowledgeable member of this group. Even the first scene where our hero Vandhiyathevan rides along the river Ponni is similar to D'Artagnan riding his funny looking horse in the first scene of 3 musketeers. </p>
<p>Also the scene where Vandhiyathevan takes on Arulmozhi without knowing who he is, is similar to D'Artagnan taking on each of the 3 Musketeers without knowing who they are.</p>
<p>These are small instances but i think the major portion of Nandhini's character is too close to Milady De Winter. Remember everybody who read 3 Musketters at one stage or the other fell in love with Milady, even when she is about to be executed Athos still loves her. Im sure every body (men folk only ;) ) who read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  must have fascinated by Nandhini in a similar fashion. Especially the way Kalki describes her during the night, its awesome!! </p>
<p>Before comparing the 2 great authors letrs understand that Dumas was never under any pressure while writing 3 Musketeers. Kalki had to deliver every week! Infact it is these errors who make the novel and man more fascinating. </p>
<p>Who wants to discuss about some 3 drunken idiots from France fighting a priest wearing a red robe or about a stupid French queen loosing her jewels in the Buckingham palace? <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is thousand times more complicated and fascinating. </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>theres one scene where milady is bound hand and foot. it reminded me <br />of nandini being taken thus to the funeral pyre of veera pandiyan.</p>
<p>that scene was totally uncalled for as nandini never betrayed <br />verapandyan. but it must have been dumas's influence that made kalki <br />write it.</p>
<p>now with rahul instigating the influence of 3 musketeeers on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym <br />i intend to read that book again and find similarities.</acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  Great answers, MrVenketesh. Im also of the opinion that Nandhini was <br />added<br />  as a sex siren. We all know about the similarities between Alexander <br />Dumas<br />  and Kalki. Kalki's Nandhini has a lot of similarities with Dumas' <br />Milady De<br />  Winter (pardon me if i got the spelling wrong) of Three Musketeers.. <br />Even<br />  the description of Nandhini by Kalki is similar to Dumas's <br />description of<br />  Milady. Milady was also described by Dumas as an incredible beauty <br />on whom<br />  anybody who set his eyes would fall in love (D'Artagnan in the ship <br />to<br />  England). There is a similar situation with our hero Vandhiyethevan <br />becoming<br />  speechless on seeing Nandhini.<br />  Nandhini did not have a Fleur De Lis but the event of Karikalan <br />(lets not<br />  call him Aditya, Karikalan is more heroic) killing the pandya in the<br />  presence of Nandhini is probably Kalki's version of Fleur De Lis. </p>
<p>  Nandhini was probably more glamorised to increase the readership <br />circle.<br />  Probably the concept of "poison inside a beauty" was exciting to the <br />youth<br />  of those days (it is still exciting now ;) ;) </p>
<p>  Wondeful thread, hope we get more in this subject.</p>
<p>  BTW before somebody crucifies me for talking about Dumas, let me <br />make it<br />  clear that I strongly believe Kalki was way superior to Dumas in <br />  characterisation.</p>

<p>      3. when old Mathurantakan becomes a contender, he too must have <br />been<br />      roped in by Ravidasan as he would be very happy play with two <br />spades</p>
<p>    true. somewhere later in the book a chola appreciates ravithasdan <br />who<br />    has now increased the number of contenders for the pandya throne.</p>

        <p>Mr.Venketesh;</p>
<p>There are lots of similarities between Dumas and Kalki. I think this is a<br />well known fact amongst the knowledgeable member of this group. Even the<br />first scene where our hero Vandhiyathevan rides along the river Ponni is<br />similar to D'Artagnan riding his funny looking horse in the first scene of 3<br />musketeers.</p>
<p>Also the scene where Vandhiyathevan takes on Arulmozhi without knowing who<br />he is, is similar to D'Artagnan taking on each of the 3 Musketeers without<br />knowing who they are.</p>
<p>These are small instances but i think the major portion of Nandhini's<br />character is too close to Milady De Winter. Remember everybody who read 3<br />Musketters at one stage or the other fell in love with Milady, even when she<br />is about to be executed Athos still loves her. Im sure every body (men folk<br />only ;) ) who read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  must have fascinated by Nandhini in a similar fashion.<br />Especially the way Kalki describes her during the night, its awesome!!</acronym></p>
<p>Before comparing the 2 great authors letrs understand that Dumas was never<br />under any pressure while writing 3 Musketeers. Kalki had to deliver every<br />week! Infact it is these errors who make the novel and man more fascinating.</p>
<p>Who wants to discuss about some 3 drunken idiots from France fighting a<br />priest wearing a red robe or about a stupid French queen loosing her jewels<br />in the Buckingham palace? <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is thousand times more complicated and<br />fascinating.</acronym></p>

<p>  Hi</p>
<p>  theres one scene where milady is bound hand and foot. it reminded me<br />  of nandini being taken thus to the funeral pyre of veera pandiyan.</p>
<p>  that scene was totally uncalled for as nandini never betrayed<br />  verapandyan. but it must have been dumas's influence that made kalki<br />  write it.</p>
<p>  now with rahul instigating the influence of 3 musketeeers on PS<br />  i intend to read that book again and find similarities.</p>

<p>    Great answers, MrVenketesh. Im also of the opinion that Nandhini was<br />  added<br />    as a sex siren. We all know about the similarities between Alexander<br />  Dumas<br />    and Kalki. Kalki's Nandhini has a lot of similarities with Dumas'<br />  Milady De<br />    Winter (pardon me if i got the spelling wrong) of Three Musketeers..<br />  Even<br />    the description of Nandhini by Kalki is similar to Dumas's<br />  description of<br />    Milady. Milady was also described by Dumas as an incredible beauty<br />  on whom<br />    anybody who set his eyes would fall in love (D'Artagnan in the ship<br />  to<br />    England). There is a similar situation with our hero Vandhiyethevan<br />  becoming<br />    speechless on seeing Nandhini.<br />    Nandhini did not have a Fleur De Lis but the event of Karikalan<br />  (lets not<br />    call him Aditya, Karikalan is more heroic) killing the pandya in the<br />    presence of Nandhini is probably Kalki's version of Fleur De Lis.</p>
<p>    Nandhini was probably more glamorised to increase the readership<br />  circle.<br />    Probably the concept of "poison inside a beauty" was exciting to the<br />  youth<br />    of those days (it is still exciting now ;) ;)</p>
<p>    Wondeful thread, hope we get more in this subject.</p>
<p>    BTW before somebody crucifies me for talking about Dumas, let me<br />  make it<br />    clear that I strongly believe Kalki was way superior to Dumas in<br />    characterisation.</p>

<p>      hI sriraman<br />      first of all we should realise( however hurt we may feel) that<br />  KALKI<br />      COULD ALSO ERR.<br />      Kalki finds in history that two pandya kings are killed in the<br />  battle<br />      with the cholas. one with rrc and one with rjc.<br />      so he fits in two charecters.( this he mentions in the post<br />  script)<br />      due to their age diferences he has to make one a small boy.</p>
<p>        3. when old Mathurantakan becomes a contender, he too must have<br />  been<br />        roped in by Ravidasan as he would be very happy play with two<br />  spades</p>
<p>      true. somewhere later in the book a chola appreciates ravithasdan<br />  who<br />      has now increased the number of contenders for the pandya throne.</p>
<p>        4.May I add another point. nandhini was created just to add<br />  support<br />      to<br />        Kundavai character.</p>
<p>      I think nandini was created to serve as a sex siren for the book.<br />  you<br />      cant have historical charecters like kunthavai or vanathi having a<br />      full blown romance with romantic( even erotic undertones)<br />  dialouges.</p>
<p>      but when we analyse the fictional charecters created by kalki we<br />  see<br />      he was more at ease with them.he was able to go into their hearts<br />  and<br />      speak for them. even a minor charecter like manimekalai comes out<br />  with<br />      flying colours. pungkuzhali, senthan amudhan,maran,karuthiruman<br />  all<br />      are full of life ,like real charecters we see in everyday life.</p>

<p>I think here's where Kalki and Chandilyan mainly differes and Kalki scores over with his characterization which makes a lasting impression upon the reader, just like Nandini, Kundavai and Vandiyathevan. </p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>theres one scene where milady is bound hand and foot. it reminded me <br />of nandini being taken thus to the funeral pyre of veera pandiyan.</p>
<p>that scene was totally uncalled for as nandini never betrayed <br />verapandyan. but it must have been dumas's influence that made kalki <br />write it.</p>
<p>now with rahul instigating the influence of 3 musketeeers on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym <br />i intend to read that book again and find similarities.</acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  Great answers, MrVenketesh. Im also of the opinion that Nandhini was <br />added<br />  as a sex siren. We all know about the similarities between Alexander <br />Dumas<br />  and Kalki. Kalki's Nandhini has a lot of similarities with Dumas' <br />Milady De<br />  Winter (pardon me if i got the spelling wrong) of Three Musketeers.. <br />Even<br />  the description of Nandhini by Kalki is similar to Dumas's <br />description of<br />  Milady. Milady was also described by Dumas as an incredible beauty <br />on whom<br />  anybody who set his eyes would fall in love (D'Artagnan in the ship <br />to<br />  England). There is a similar situation with our hero Vandhiyethevan <br />becoming<br />  speechless on seeing Nandhini.<br />  Nandhini did not have a Fleur De Lis but the event of Karikalan <br />(lets not<br />  call him Aditya, Karikalan is more heroic) killing the pandya in the<br />  presence of Nandhini is probably Kalki's version of Fleur De Lis.</p>
<p>  Nandhini was probably more glamorised to increase the readership <br />circle.<br />  Probably the concept of "poison inside a beauty" was exciting to the <br />youth<br />  of those days (it is still exciting now ;) ;)</p>
<p>  Wondeful thread, hope we get more in this subject.</p>
<p>  BTW before somebody crucifies me for talking about Dumas, let me <br />make it<br />  clear that I strongly believe Kalki was way superior to Dumas in<br />  characterisation.</p>

        <p>hi venkat</p>
<p>i am not a student of law. as said earlier a keen student of common<br />snese (or with common sense?). i leave it to you.</p>
<p>clarfy the following points as i do not have the copies of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  now on<br />hand.</acronym></p>
<p>1. Who is the mother of young Pandyan king?</p>
<p>2. why he was just introduced for a flash moment in the novel by Kalki?<br />T0 me he did so to keep the mometum in the serial (repeat serial novel).<br />he needed a fulcrum on which the apathudavis can take a vow. there no<br />point in just taking revenge. there must be a cause for revenge. that is<br />hindu dharma. so the author introduced a child, every one gain sympathy<br />in the cause for revenge . even some sane voice will accept that Nadhini<br />is correct in planning to kill Aditya, the focul point of the story at<br />that time.</p>
<p>3. when old Mathurantakan becomes a contender, he too must have been<br />roped in by Ravidasan as he would be very happy play with two spades A.<br />Modern management is all about Plan B. So the two contendenter are<br />mutual Plan B in ravidasan's scheme. So Kalki allowed it be so and also<br />to stand by the historical facts of war of succession to the Pandyan's<br />throne . Am I correct?</p>
<p>4.May I add another point. nandhini was created just to add support to<br />Kundavai character. In a plot where there is real no hero/heroine Vs<br />Villain, when a plot focus on more around situations rather than<br />characters, it imperative to create pairs of characters.<br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VVD</acronym -Alwarkadiyan, Aditya-Rajaraja, Kundavai &amp; her shadow Vanadi-<br />Nandhini, Aniruddha-Paluvettaraiyar, Pathibendran-Kandamaran, many<br />opposing minor characters. If you write a story with just Kundavai and<br />her shadow Vanadi, it will be a drab Kundavai pampering <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , teasing<br />Vanadi, consulting the Kudanthai astrolgers, discussing religion with<br />Sembiyan madevi. Kundavai character will lose its importance. So<br />Nandhini was created by Kalki to highlight Kundavai.</acronym></acronym></p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear all</p>
<p>I wish to one point about nandhini. As per my view nandhini had gread affection with her mother<br />when she hear about her mother story she decided to kill both veerapandya( because he raped uumai nachiar ) and sundara cholan( because he left her mother) </p>
<p>Because once adithya discussed with vandya devan, he tells that he was not at all decided to kill<br />VP when nandhini told him that he was her lover leave him., then only he got angry and<br />killed VP. and he also told to vandya devan that it is also one of the drama of nandhini<br />to kill veerapandya</p>

<p>Hi Gokul,</p>
<p>Thanks for the input. I am of the opinion, that Nandhini's father could be of pandya origin or relations.. for that matter even cholas are related Pandyas and chera, so its an maaman-machan sandai.. or is it could a dowry problem?</p>
<p>Amarabhujan cannot make a claim to the pandya throne with pandya abathuthaviyagal. . </p>
<p>Nandhini is also called "Amma" by Veera pandiyan's son.. the pandya heir... so there is no chance that Nandhini is veera pandiyan 's daughter.</p>
<p>Regards<br />Nanda</p>

<p>Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father</p>
<p>Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting insights into Nandhini's<br />parentage. My full appreciation to their<br />efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative.</p>
<p>* Pavitra says Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form of<br />inconsistency and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan -<br />nandini's<br />father and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not true !<br />Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -not<br />only in the<br />first part (Pudhu vellam)<br />(Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but even also in the fourth part !<br />Just before the murder of Aditya, The head of Pandiyan appears before<br />nandhini -<br />and she exclaims and talks in<br />hallucination like this<br />" Oh Dear ! Have you come ? Welcome !....and<br />so on ...".<br />In fact if you carefully read<br />the novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera<br />Pandiyan she<br />always says that he is her lover -<br />Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!</p>
<p>* There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when she<br />has her<br />final talk with Aditya. Even here,<br />Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this :<br />Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is.......... ......."<br />Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this<br />conversation and<br />heard that she was mentioning the<br />name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide this fact<br />directly during Nandhini's final<br />dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think there<br />is a very<br />very definite purpose and<br />I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly ref my last<br />lines in<br />this<br />mail)</p>
<p>* Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />throughout the<br />Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />indeed Nandhini's Lover.</p>
<p>* The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is Nandhini's<br />father come<br />from Karuthiruman. But please<br />remember<br />- Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point of<br />time he<br />says he fathered nandhini!<br />- This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to pandiyas.<br />- There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />Vandhiyathevan, that<br />too during a time pass chat !<br />Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />- Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow is more<br />dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets the<br />eye ( I<br />plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future).</p>
<p>* In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  ( I don't know whether<br />all of<br />you<br />have read the conclusion. It is<br />very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says :<br />"Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to Arulmozhi... "<br />If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />Vandhiyathevan<br />he need not have written these lines<br />at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers - he<br />had many<br />more ideas about the characters them<br />selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even further !</acronym></p>
<p>Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT VEERA<br />PANDIYAN<br />?????</p>
<p>I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.</p>

<blockquote><p>  3. In fact Kalki, being the master story teller, he wanted to <br />highlight<br />  the spoilt mind of Nandhini due to her lonely childhood and the <br />insults<br />  heaped at her. Nandhini must have developed a complex (can any<br />  Psychologist name it), where she wanted to become a prince/queen. <br />She<br />  must have been afraid about her parentage so she tried to unknot the<br />  secret. Perhaps by establishing her royal lineage she will be on<br />  stronger ground to fight Kundavai. Therefore she repeatedly believed <br />or<br />  rather prayed Veerapandya was her father.</p></blockquote>
<p>ravithasan was not a fool. why did he accept amarabhujangan as the <br />pandya heir and also his leader? definitely he must be in the lineage <br />of the pandyas.<br />whatever is true for amarabhujangan is true also for nandini as they <br />were twins.</p>

I think <br />there<br />    is a very<br />    very definite purpose and<br />    I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly ref my <br />last<br />    lines in<br />    this mail)</p>
<p>    * Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />    throughout the<br />    Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />    indeed Nandhini's Lover.</p>
<p>    * The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is <br />Nandhini's<br />    father come<br />    from Karuthiruman. But please<br />    remember<br />    - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point <br />of<br />    time he<br />    says he fathered nandhini!<br />    - This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to <br />  pandiyas.<br />    - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />    Vandhiyathevan, that<br />    too during a time pass chat !<br />    Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />    - Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow <br />  is more<br />    dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets <br />  the<br />    eye ( I<br />    plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the <br />future<br />  ).</p>
<p>    * In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for PS ( I don't know <br />  whether<br />    all of<br />    you have read the conclusion. It is<br />    very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says :<br />    "Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to <br />  Arulmozhi..."<br />    If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />    Vandhiyathevan<br />    he need not have written these lines<br />    at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers - <br />  he<br />    had many<br />    more ideas about the characters them<br />    selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even <br />further<br />  !</p>
<p>    Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT <br />VEERA<br />    PANDIYAN<br />    ?????</p>
<p>    I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />    Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.</p>

          NanDini!!!!!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>hi</p>
<p>A. Please refer to Karuthiruman Kathai chapter (part 5).<br />According to the statement made by him the following can be summarised:</p>
<p>1. That he saved Mandakini from lighthouse of Kodiakkari.</p>
<p>2. He met possibly Aniruddha and his men ( a statement corroborated by<br />Sundara Chola as he sent in his minister &amp; friend to search for her).</p>
<p>3. He took her to a nearby island for money. She did not recognise even<br />her father as she was having amnesia. At the same time he also gives a<br />lift to man, who turned out to be the Pandyan king. What was he doing in<br />mid sea? Why he went to Kodiakkarai? If at he wanted to go to Lanka he<br />could have easily crossed the sea at Ramesvaram? Only Kalki can answer<br />this strange coincidence.</p>
<p>4. Karuthiruman leaves Veerapandya, the girl with amnesia (or mentally<br />unsound) and goes on to meet the Lankan king. Within few days<br />Veerapandya joins Karuthiruman at the court of Lankan king. Pandyan king<br />offers gold to him for the girl at Bhutathivu.</p>
<p>5. Karuthiruman meets her again within few days at Kodiakkari. Her<br />father had already died.</p>
<p>6. She regains her memory. She is found to be pregnant. She delivers the<br />twins - Nandhini and Old Madurantakan.</p>
<p>7. So when did she become pregnant? BY the Pandyan king when she was not<br />in her senses? If so, Veerapandyan got the deserving punishment at the<br />hands of Aditya.</p>
<p>8. She could not have become a mother due to Karuthiruman as he left<br />immediately after dropping her at Bhutativu.</p>
<p>B.In the chapter 62 Etti Painthathu</p>
<p>1. OId Mathurantakan enquires about his father, fearing that he may<br />claim the right. But Karuthiruman, informs him that he is a Rajakumaran<br />and he himself is the servant of his father - obviously Veerapandyan. he<br />was pleasantly surprised after having informed he is not the rightful<br />heir to Chola throne.</p>
<p>2. In the Chapter 64 Unnmaiyai Chol, Alwakadiyan extracts some<br />information from Karuthiruman.</p>
<p>C. In Chapter 90 Ponmazhai Pozhinthatu, in the long conversation between<br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VVD</acronym  and Kundavai, she expresses a doubt over this issue - Veerapandyan<br />being the father of Nandini. <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VVD</acronym  confirms that the name was uttered by<br />Nandini, hence Paluvettaraiyar got angry with her. Again Kundavai<br />express a doubt whether a lady could call her father a lover?. <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VVD</acronym <br />substantiates that it is the character of Nandhini and the situation<br />warranted as Aditya was so hot headed at that time.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>What all this means?</p>
<p>1. Kalki wanted this issue to be live and unsettles one right through<br />like the secret about the actual assassin of Aditya. These two are the<br />core issues of the whole story and all the events leads to it until he<br />changes the track and pleased at the sacrifice of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym . Perhaps a later<br />thought.</acronym></p>
<p>2. Perhaps he introduced the character Karuthiruman only to confuse this<br />issue. He suggests that Mandakini became pregnant when she was not in<br />her senses. Both Veerapandya and Karuthiruman hardly spent few days with<br />her. How could they all be the father of her children?</p>
<p>3. In fact Kalki, being the master story teller, he wanted to highlight<br />the spoilt mind of Nandhini due to her lonely childhood and the insults<br />heaped at her. Nandhini must have developed a complex (can any<br />Psychologist name it), where she wanted to become a prince/queen. She<br />must have been afraid about her parentage so she tried to unknot the<br />secret. Perhaps by establishing her royal lineage she will be on<br />stronger ground to fight Kundavai. Therefore she repeatedly believed or<br />rather prayed Veerapandya was her father.</p>
<p>4. So Kalki wanted all of us to keep guessing. Even Nadhini was not so<br />sure, when she told what she believed to the truth to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .</p>
<p>As I said it is best kept secret of the novel. A prerogative of any<br />story teller is to leave loose ends. A tightly written story becomes<br />history, not a historical novel. Kalki is not writing history for that<br />matter. He drew a firm line as an historical novel writer and historian.<br />His post script proves it.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Sriraman.p.s</p>

<p>we have already discussed that long back .but for your benefit.</p>
<p>murugaiyyan s/o thiyaga vidangar, brother of pungkuzhali, and husband <br />of rakkamaal( niyaabakam varuthaa?) is introduced as a physically <br />challenged charecter in earluier chapters but talks volumes later in <br />the thiruvarur elephant scene.</p>
<p>kalki half way tries to rewrite it as a henpecked silent husband but <br />had already commited himeself</p>
<p>also in one place kalki uses the words mugalayar when there was anothe <br />300 yeares for babar to be born.<br />in one place he makes sembiyan mathevi ask a group of bhaktas " which <br />malapaaadi" and then later says as is true in history that she was <br />born in malapaadi itself</p>

<p>    Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father</p>
<p>    Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting insights into <br />  Nandhini's<br />    parentage. My full appreciation to their<br />    efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative.</p>
<p>    * Pavitra says Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form <br />of<br />    inconsistency and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan -<br />    nandini's<br />    father and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not <br />  true !<br />    Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -<br />not<br />    only in the<br />    first part (Pudhu vellam)<br />    (Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but even also in the fourth part !<br />    Just before the murder of Aditya, The head of Pandiyan appears <br />  before<br />    nandhini -<br />    and she exclaims and talks in<br />    hallucination like this " Oh Dear ! Have you come ? Welcome !....<br />and<br />    so on ...".<br />    In fact if you carefully read<br />    the novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera<br />    Pandiyan she<br />    always says that he is her lover -<br />    Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!</p>
<p>    * There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when <br />she<br />    has her<br />    final talk with Aditya. Even here,<br />    Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this :<br />    Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is................."<br />    Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this<br />    conversation and<br />    heard that she was mentioning the<br />    name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide <br />  this fact<br />    directly during Nandhini's final<br />    dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think <br />there<br />    is a very<br />    very definite purpose and<br />    I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly ref my <br />last<br />    lines in<br />    this mail)</p>
<p>    * Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />    throughout the<br />    Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />    indeed Nandhini's Lover.</p>
<p>    * The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is <br />Nandhini's<br />    father come<br />    from Karuthiruman. But please<br />    remember<br />    - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point <br />of<br />    time he<br />    says he fathered nandhini!<br />    - This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to <br />  pandiyas.<br />    - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />    Vandhiyathevan, that<br />    too during a time pass chat !<br />    Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />    - Thus all of his statments are to be rejected.

<p>    Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father</p>
<p>    Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting insights into <br />  Nandhini's<br />    parentage. My full appreciation to their<br />    efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative.</p>
<p>    * Pavitra says Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form <br />of<br />    inconsistency and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan -<br />    nandini's<br />    father and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not <br />  true !<br />    Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -<br />not<br />    only in the<br />    first part (Pudhu vellam)<br />    (Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but even also in the fourth part !<br />    Just before the murder of Aditya, The head of Pandiyan appears <br />  before<br />    nandhini -<br />    and she exclaims and talks in<br />    hallucination like this " Oh Dear ! Have you come ? Welcome !....<br />and<br />    so on ...".<br />    In fact if you carefully read<br />    the novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera<br />    Pandiyan she<br />    always says that he is her lover -<br />    Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!</p>
<p>    * There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when <br />she<br />    has her<br />    final talk with Aditya. Even here,<br />    Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this :<br />    Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is................."<br />    Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this<br />    conversation and<br />    heard that she was mentioning the<br />    name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide <br />  this fact<br />    directly during Nandhini's final<br />    dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think <br />there<br />    is a very<br />    very definite purpose and<br />    I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly ref my <br />last<br />    lines in<br />    this mail)</p>
<p>    * Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />    throughout the<br />    Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />    indeed Nandhini's Lover.</p>
<p>    * The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is <br />Nandhini's<br />    father come<br />    from Karuthiruman. But please<br />    remember<br />    - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point <br />of<br />    time he<br />    says he fathered nandhini!<br />    - This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to <br />  pandiyas.<br />    - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />    Vandhiyathevan, that<br />    too during a time pass chat !<br />    Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />    - Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow <br />  is more<br />    dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets <br />  the<br />    eye ( I<br />    plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the <br />future<br />  ).</p>
<p>    * In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for PS ( I don't know <br />  whether<br />    all of<br />    you have read the conclusion. It is<br />    very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says :<br />    "Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to <br />  Arulmozhi..."<br />    If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />    Vandhiyathevan<br />    he need not have written these lines<br />    at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers - <br />  he<br />    had many<br />    more ideas about the characters them<br />    selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even <br />further<br />  !</p>
<p>    Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT <br />VEERA<br />    PANDIYAN<br />    ?????</p>
<p>    I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />    Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.</p>

At one point of<br />  time he<br />  says he fathered nandhini!<br />  - This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to <br />pandiyas.<br />  - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />  Vandhiyathevan, that<br />  too during a time pass chat !<br />  Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />  - Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow <br />is more<br />  dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets <br />the<br />  eye ( I<br />  plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future<br />).</p>
<p>  * In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for PS ( I don't know <br />whether<br />  all of<br />  you have read the conclusion. It is<br />  very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says :<br />  "Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to <br />Arulmozhi..."<br />  If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />  Vandhiyathevan<br />  he need not have written these lines<br />  at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers - <br />he<br />  had many<br />  more ideas about the characters them<br />  selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even further<br />!</p>
<p>  Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT VEERA<br />  PANDIYAN<br />  ?????</p>
<p>  I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />  Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.</p>

<p>    Amarabhujan cannot make a claim to the pandya throne with <br />pandya <br />  abathuthaviyagal.. </p>
<p>    Nandhini is also called "Amma" by Veera pandiyan's son.. the <br />  pandya heir... so there is no chance that Nandhini is veera <br />pandiyan <br />  's daughter.</p>

<p>    Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father</p>
<p>    Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting insights into <br />  Nandhini's<br />    parentage. My full appreciation to their<br />    efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative.</p>
<p>    * Pavitra says Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form <br />of<br />    inconsistency and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan -<br />    nandini's<br />    father and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not <br />  true !<br />    Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -<br />not<br />    only in the<br />    first part (Pudhu vellam)<br />    (Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but even also in the fourth part !<br />    Just before the murder of Aditya, The head of Pandiyan appears <br />  before<br />    nandhini -<br />    and she exclaims and talks in<br />    hallucination like this " Oh Dear ! Have you come ? Welcome !....<br />and<br />    so on ...".<br />    In fact if you carefully read<br />    the novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera<br />    Pandiyan she<br />    always says that he is her lover -<br />    Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!</p>
<p>    * There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when <br />she<br />    has her<br />    final talk with Aditya. Even here,<br />    Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this :<br />    Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is................."<br />    Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this<br />    conversation and<br />    heard that she was mentioning the<br />    name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide <br />  this fact<br />    directly during Nandhini's final<br />    dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think <br />there<br />    is a very<br />    very definite purpose and<br />    I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly ref my <br />last<br />    lines in<br />    this mail)</p>
<p>    * Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />    throughout the<br />    Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />    indeed Nandhini's Lover.</p>
<p>    * The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is <br />Nandhini's<br />    father come<br />    from Karuthiruman. But please<br />    remember<br />    - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point <br />of<br />    time he<br />    says he fathered nandhini!<br />    - This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to <br />  pandiyas.<br />    - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />    Vandhiyathevan, that<br />    too during a time pass chat !<br />    Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />    - Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this <br />fellow <br />  is more<br />    dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what <br />meets <br />  the<br />    eye ( I<br />    plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the <br />future<br />  ).</p>
<p>    * In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for PS ( I don't know <br />  whether<br />    all of<br />    you have read the conclusion. It is<br />    very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says :<br />    "Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to <br />  Arulmozhi..."<br />    If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />    Vandhiyathevan<br />    he need not have written these lines<br />    at all.

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>in the same post script to the novel its said that amarabhujangan dies <br />in a war with <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  much later.</p>
<p>so he had been accepted a pandya heir. then his twin???</p>
<p>some of us should take pains and chronologically list nanthini's life</p>
<p>Birth: in the garden in senthan amudhans hut to uumai naachiyaar.</p>
<p>as a child she is handed to alwarkadiyan for bring up by the prime <br />minister.</p>
<p>childhood; chola palace where she is teased by kunthavai and tormented <br />by sembiyan mathevi.<br />youth. the inevitable happens. aaditya falls in love with her and <br />nanthini is banished to a gurukkals house in pandya naadu.<br />then comes a scene when she mees a violent aditya a who kills <br />veerapandiyan before her</p>
<p>ravithasan also talks to nandini about the past when he says that she <br />was bound hands and foot by pandya apathuthavis and was about to be <br />thrown into the funeral pyre of veera pandyan.( a scene similar to 3 <br />musketeers)</p>
<p>in the mean time aalvarkku adiyaan also reminicences about he and <br />nandini going from temple to temple singing prapandham songa</p>
<p>finally she is seen on the road by periya paluvettaraiyar and marries <br />him</p>
<p>THALAI SUTHUTHU.</p>
<p>how did she have time to do all this and be at so many places.</p>
<p>if you ask me Nandini was not only kalki's magnum but also his <br />sarukkal.</p>

<p>  Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father</p>
<p>  Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting insights into <br />Nandhini's<br />  parentage. My full appreciation to their<br />  efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative.</p>
<p>  * Pavitra says Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form of<br />  inconsistency and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan -<br />  nandini's<br />  father and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not <br />true !<br />  Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -not<br />  only in the<br />  first part (Pudhu vellam)<br />  (Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but even also in the fourth part !<br />  Just before the murder of Aditya, The head of Pandiyan appears <br />before<br />  nandhini -<br />  and she exclaims and talks in<br />  hallucination like this " Oh Dear ! Have you come ? Welcome !....and<br />  so on ...".<br />  In fact if you carefully read<br />  the novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera<br />  Pandiyan she<br />  always says that he is her lover -<br />  Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!</p>
<p>  * There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when she<br />  has her<br />  final talk with Aditya. Even here,<br />  Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this :<br />  Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is................."<br />  Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this<br />  conversation and<br />  heard that she was mentioning the<br />  name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide <br />this fact<br />  directly during Nandhini's final<br />  dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think there<br />  is a very<br />  very definite purpose and<br />  I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly ref my last<br />  lines in<br />  this mail)</p>
<p>  * Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />  throughout the<br />  Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />  indeed Nandhini's Lover.</p>
<p>  * The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is Nandhini's<br />  father come<br />  from Karuthiruman. But please<br />  remember<br />  - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point of<br />  time he<br />  says he fathered nandhini!<br />  - This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to <br />pandiyas.<br />  - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />  Vandhiyathevan, that<br />  too during a time pass chat !<br />  Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />  - Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow <br />is more<br />  dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets <br />the<br />  eye ( I<br />  plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future<br />).</p>
<p>  * In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for PS ( I don't know <br />whether<br />  all of<br />  you have read the conclusion. It is<br />  very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says :<br />  "Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to <br />Arulmozhi..."<br />  If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />  Vandhiyathevan<br />  he need not have written these lines<br />  at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers - <br />he<br />  had many<br />  more ideas about the characters them<br />  selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even further<br />!</p>
<p>  Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT VEERA<br />  PANDIYAN<br />  ?????</p>
<p>  I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />  Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.</p>

At one point of<br />  time he<br />  says he fathered nandhini!<br />  - This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to <br />pandiyas.<br />  - There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />  Vandhiyathevan, that<br />  too during a time pass chat !<br />  Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />  - Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow <br />is more<br />  dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets <br />the<br />  eye ( I<br />  plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future<br />).</p>
<p>  * In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for PS ( I don't know <br />whether<br />  all of<br />  you have read the conclusion. It is<br />  very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says :<br />  "Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to <br />Arulmozhi..."<br />  If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />  Vandhiyathevan<br />  he need not have written these lines<br />  at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers - <br />he<br />  had many<br />  more ideas about the characters them<br />  selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even further<br />!</p>
<p>  Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT VEERA<br />  PANDIYAN<br />  ?????</p>
<p>  I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />  Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.</p>
<p>  Cheers !<br />  Gokul</p>

          NanDini!!!!!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Message No 188 from archives reproduced:</p>
<p>Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father</p>
<p>Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting insights into Nandhini's<br />parentage. My full appreciation to their<br />efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative.</p>
<p>* Pavitra says Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form of<br />inconsistency and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan -<br />nandini's<br />father and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not true !<br />Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -not<br />only in the<br />first part (Pudhu vellam)<br />(Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but even also in the fourth part !<br />Just before the murder of Aditya, The head of Pandiyan appears before<br />nandhini -<br />and she exclaims and talks in<br />hallucination like this " Oh Dear ! Have you come ? Welcome !....and<br />so on ...".<br />In fact if you carefully read<br />the novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera<br />Pandiyan she<br />always says that he is her lover -<br />Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!</p>
<p>* There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when she<br />has her<br />final talk with Aditya. Even here,<br />Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this :<br />Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is................."<br />Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this<br />conversation and<br />heard that she was mentioning the<br />name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide this fact<br />directly during Nandhini's final<br />dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think there<br />is a very<br />very definite purpose and<br />I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly ref my last<br />lines in<br />this mail)</p>
<p>* Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture<br />throughout the<br />Novel that Veera pandiyan is<br />indeed Nandhini's Lover.</p>
<p>* The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is Nandhini's<br />father come<br />from Karuthiruman. But please<br />remember<br />- Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point of<br />time he<br />says he fathered nandhini!<br />- This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to pandiyas.<br />- There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to<br />Vandhiyathevan, that<br />too during a time pass chat !<br />Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !<br />- Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow is more<br />dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets the<br />eye ( I<br />plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future).</p>
<p>* In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  ( I don't know whether<br />all of<br />you have read the conclusion. It is<br />very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says :<br />"Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to Arulmozhi..."<br />If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through<br />Vandhiyathevan<br />he need not have written these lines<br />at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers - he<br />had many<br />more ideas about the characters them<br />selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even further !</acronym></p>
<p>Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT VEERA<br />PANDIYAN<br />?????</p>
<p>I plan to take this topic in the near future.<br />Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.</p>
<p>Cheers !<br />Gokul</p>

        <p>Hi Sathish</p>
<p>while on the topic</p>
<p>the classic hollywood movie Ben hur ( It went on to win eleven Academy <br />Awards, including best picture for 1959, a feat equaled only by <br />Titanic and The Lord of the Rings ).<br />the movie has a charriot race scene in roman times that goes on on <br />and on.<br />it was world famous.considered to be one of the most spectacular <br />action sequences ever filmed. Filmed long before the advent of <br />computer-generated effects, it took over three months to complete, <br />using 8000 extras on the largest film set ever built, some 18 acres</p>
<p>but then movie enthusiasts reportedly discovered in that scene- a <br />smalll red car moving in the opposite direction</p>
<p>also in one initial scene jesus being born in a stable is shown.In the <br />Bethlehem scene early, a young Holstein Cow appears. This breed was <br />created in Germany in the 19th century, so its appearance at Jesus' <br />birth would have been impossible.</p>

        <p>Kalki was very clear in thought. I just completed reading the book published <br />by Thendral Nilayam, Chidambaram. In the epilogue, as an answer to Question <br />No 7, Kalki answers that Nandini informs <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  about the secret of her birth and <br />who Killed Aditya. So he knew about the secret or doesn't he? Or he does not <br />want to inform the reader about it to leave them gussing? A good kept secret.<br />Regards <br />Sriraman.p.s </acronym></p>

        <p>hi<br />kalki contradicts himself quite often which can be expected because he <br />was writing one segment weekly.</p>
<p>my guess was he realised this at one point and stopped his novel.</p>
<p>except for karuthiruman here are no real witnesses for these things.<br />and nandini really has no time for this romance.<br />she is chucked out of the chola palace by sembian madevi and the rest <br />of the time spends her life with the gurukkal family in pandiyanadu.<br />in the mean time veerapaandiyan was either on the battle field or on <br />the run</p>
<p>karuthiruman accepts nandini and amara bujankan as twins. and says <br />amarabujangan was veera paandiyans son</p>
<p>an injured veerapandiyan might have mistaken nandini to have been her <br />mother oomai rani for there is a marked facial resemblance.</p>

        <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The more we get details through literary and inscriptional evidences<br />and the kind of discussions we have been having for the past 4 - 5<br />years, I am sure we all agree that KALKI is a MASTER STORY TELLER and<br />that he avoided contraversial things for speculation :</p>
<p>Apart from Who murdered Aditha Karikalan,<br />Eazham (marital ?) connections with Chozhas are touched thro" Mandhakini<br />&amp; Vani ..<br />so are the Pandya connections !</p>
<p>to zero on an equivalent character to Nandhini .. Pazhuvur Nakkan <br />PANCHAVAN MADEVI would have come closer, but Nandhini is portraited as<br />ANTI -HEROINE !<br />VEERANARAYANI - Queen - w/o Parantaka from Chera province - might have<br />been another inspiration !</p>
<p>Nandhini - as usual evasive yet haunting ! sps</p>
