<p>  Dear Friends, </p>
<p>  IT is interesting to go through these details again on the auspicious occasion of Most Rev. Alphonsa - born in Kottayam, Kerala in 1910, became aNUN in 1927 and died in 1946 is being accorded SAINTHOOD by the HH Pope Benedict XVI in Vatican as of now (ON 12.10,2008)</p>
<p>  The Sainthood is accorded since a physically challenged child got <br />  cured sometime back after praying in front of the Tomb of (St) Most <br />  Rev Alphonsa !</p>

<p>  In the FIRST issue of <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a>, an article<br />  under the caption:<br />    Udayaloril Pallippadaya ? is published. In this<br />  article, the <br />    details of inscriptions have been gone into.. and<br />    finally ending <br />    saying nothing in the inscription is related to<br />    pallippadai ..</p>
<p>    The details are like this:</p>
<p>    There was a Sivapathasekara Mangalam.. (now known as Udayalur / Near <br />    Pazhayarai @ Patteswaram - which comprises of Ariyapadaiveedu, <br />    pambapadaiveedu (Contonments) ..and nandhipuram (vinagaram !). </p>
<p>    The Siva temple in udayalur conains inscriptions showing this name.</p>
<p>    In Udayalur, there are about 3 temples. <br />    1. Siva Temple. <br />    2. Perumal (Vinnagaram). <br />    3. Paalkulathamman koil (on the banks of a village tank. </p>
<p>    Udayalur Kalyanakrishna B agavathar - propular Harikatha exponent - <br />    hails from this Village. This Agraharam figures in lot of Tamil TV <br />    serials of -late!</p>
<p>    In the entrance pillar of Palkulathaman exists the inscription !<br />    The pillars are used for installing the temple gate and almost half <br />    cemented &amp; painted red - thanks to lack of concern to our History).</p>
<p>    Kudanthai Sethuraman ( of Raman &amp; Raman bus Service<br />    - Industrialist - passed away 20 years back) published a series of <br />    articles way back in 70s - which included an article that this was <br />    related to RRC's samadhi / Pulavar Mahadevan ( of Dhinamalar - now <br />    too) has helped him in these matters.</p>
<p>    (Now retired) Principal of Thiruvaiyaru Arts<br />    College - Dr. Thangamani has supported this view (as Published in <br />    Vikadan Diwali Malar - 2007 - reported in the Gp earlier).</p>
<p>    Kudavoil Dr. Balasubamanian of Thanjavur claimed that the details <br />    are 90% true (as reported in the Junior Vikadan current issue..) but <br />    not 100% ..)</p>
<p>    What is NOT reported widely is THAT THESE <br />    INSCRIPTIONS are FOUND <br />    by the British Archeologists as early in 1927-28<br />    and Published in <br />    the Annual Report of Epigraphy (ARE) under the<br />    heading "Samadhi <br />    Temples " and " Pallipadais"</p>
<p>    Sethuraman quoted apart from this inscription, <br />    other inscriptions <br />    also :</p>
<p>    1. Easana Siva Pandithar (who was the chief Priest<br />    of the Big Temple ) was incharge of Sivapathasekaramangalam<br />    temple !</p>
<p>    2. They were practicing Mahavradham and known as<br />    Mahavradhis. Which<br />    is known as Paasupatha - Laguleesam and this cult<br />    normally maintains Pallippadais and they did maintain the Pallippadai<br />    of Panchavan Madevi - which is located about 3 KMs West of this<br />    temple ! (about 1 KM west of Patteswaram Durgai temple)</p>
<p>    3. The dilapidated MANDAP (Mundril) was renovated -<br />    after the renovator OBSERVED VRADHAMs ! - after about 100<br />    years ! in Kulothunga Period !<br />    (There is an instance where another Dilapidated Siva temple<br />    nearby was renovated, but the renovator DID NOT perform Vradham )</p>
<p>    4. RRC - atleast after making RjC as Heir -<br />    apparent in 1012 AD (both co-ruled for 3 years) - appeared to have<br />    become Godly person </p>
<p>    (Pls go through Archives - Godification of RRC) -<br />    assumed the name<br />    Sivapathasekaran and his idols were kept and<br />    worshipped in the Big<br />    Temple and several other temples including<br />    Papanasam !</p>
<p>    5. Easana Siva Pandithar - who was maintaing Udayalur / Pateswaram <br />    temples - idol is also installed in <br />    in the Big temple and several grants were<br />    accorded! Means he was kept in very high esteem by RRC as<br />    well as RjC!</p>
<p>    6. Through the 4th year inscription of RjC in the Big Temple. we <br />    realise that a VIBOODHI MADAL was also placed in front of PERIYADEVAR <br />    IDOL OF RRC ! </p>
<p>    Summarising ..</p>
<p>    The line of thinking that RRC was Godified and his<br />    mortals were accorded Godly status is not out of place ..</p>
<p>    Whether Udayalur is the Venue is to be decided beyond traces of <br />    doubt ..</p>
<p>    Scholars have taken up this matter to the State Government..</p>
<p>    A detailed excavation may reveal more details..</p>

<p>    ****************************************************<br />      S. R. Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola Art, part I, Asia<br />      Publishing house, 1966 p.18-<br />      "There are also a number of memorial (sepulchral) tomb<br />      temples called paLLippaDai or samAdhi-kOyil. The earliest<br />      epigraphical reference to the building of a pallippadai<br />      is found in an inscription of the 8th year of Vijaya<br />      Kampavarman (886 A.D.) from Cholapuram (429 of 1902 and<br />      EI, vii, p.193). It mentions that Rajaditya, a member<br />      of the Gangeya vamsa bilingual and a subordinate Chief under<br />      Pallava Vijaya Kampavarman, built a memorial Siva temple and<br />      a tomb in memory of his deceased father Prithvigangaraiyar. The<br />      inscription is bilingual. The sanskrit part gives a<br />      part of the genealogy of the Gangas descended from Kongunivarman,<br />      and the tamil part records that Rajaditya built a palippadai<br />      Siva temple in memory of his father and a tomb where his<br />      mortal remains were interred. Here are the relevant lines:<br />      'Ko visaya kamparkku yaaNDu eTTaavatu pritivigangaraiyar<br />      atitar aayina piRpaaDu tatputra Rajadityan Mahadevan<br />      tam appanaarai *paLLippaDutta iDattu* Isvara aalayamum,<br />      atita graramum (grihamum?) eDuppittuk kaNDu (ndu)<br />      sEvittaan'.</p>
<p>      The use of the expression *paLLippaDutta - iDattu* is<br />      siginficant. It means the place where the dead was laid<br />      to eternal rest - a tomb where the bones of the dead were<br />      buried. It seems to have been the practice to bury the dead<br />      in a tomb and also erect a memorial temple in memory of<br />      the dead. (The Ramayana of Valmiki mentions the<br />      'Smasana Chaitya')</p>
<p>      Other important examples are the pallippaDai temples built<br />      by Parantaka I in honor of Aditya I/Kodandaraman/Tondaimaan<br />      Arruur Tunjina Devar alias Arinjaya at Melpadi built by Rajaraja I<br />      in his 29th regnal year (1014 AD) in memory of his grandfather<br />      Arinjaya who died at Arruur- which name seems to refer to<br />      Melpadi itself, on the banks of the Niva or Ponni river.</p>
<p>      "AaRRuur tuJcina tEvarkku paLLippaDaiyaaka Sri Rajaraja<br />      Devar eDuppittaruLina tiru-ariJcikai-iicuvaram"</p>
<p>      The devaraja cult in Indo-china and Indonesia:</p>
<p>      In an excellent guidebook, G. Coedes has devoted two chapters<br />      to the institution in Cambodia similar to that of paLLippaDai<br />      prevalent S. India. He holds that the great majaority of<br />      the statues of "siva, Vishnu, Buddha and other deities found in <br />    Cambodia<br />      were really representations of kings, princes and other<br />      dignitaries in the form of the gods into whom they expected<br />      to be absorbed at the end of their earthly existence.<br />      The "royal essence" was supposed to reside in a linga, or a statue<br />      of siva, vishnu or buddha. What the body was to a person<br />      while alive, that the temple became after the lifetime, namely,<br />      the architectural abode of the God-King. The communion<br />      between the king and the god tookplace thru' the mediation of<br />      the priest on the sacred mountain in the center of the capital.<br />      The devaraja became the palladium of the kingdom. And this<br />      custom prevailed in Cambodia from about the 9th century AD<br />      (if not earlier) to at least the end of the 12th century AD.</p>
<p>      But on account of the despoliation of the monuments by<br />      treasure-hunters, Coedes was unable to establish beyond<br />      doubt if the corpse was interred, or if, as in modern<br />      Cambodia or Thailand, the ashes or bones were enclosed<br />      in an urn after cremation and the urn deposited in a pagoda.<br />      However, he concludes that the monuments from the time<br />      of Jayavarman VII were temples as well as tombs, and ends by<br />      saying that "Angkor Wat was the final habitation of a<br />      being who enjoyed certain devine prerogatives during<br />      his life, and whom death had transformed into a god.<br />      It was a funerary temple".</p>
<p>      The epigraphical evidence in S. India confirms such a<br />      conclusion. The Cholapuram inscription of the 9th<br />      century mentions clearly both an Isvara-alyam<br />      and an atita griham. Usually such funerary temples<br />      were erected over the places of burial of the mortal<br />      remains of ascetics, saints ans sages. One of the latest and most <br />    popular<br />      of such funerary temples in S. India is the that of the<br />      great musician-saint Tyagaraja, on the banks of the river Kaveri.</p>
<p>      We know that the cultural drift was generally from India to SE Asia.<br />      But we do not know whether the personality or devaraja cult had an <br />    earlier<br />      common origin or was an outflow from India or had an independent<br />      parallel development in the two regions. We have to<br />      suspend judgement till such time as we get more light on this<br />      question, and meanwhile, rest satisfied with the knowledge that<br />      similar cults were in existence more or less in the same period<br />      in the land bordering Bay of Bengal, tho' the devaraja cult<br />      of SE asia had its own pecuiar development with its own<br />      individualistic features of its own".</p>

<p>      Panchavan Maadevi Isvaram</p>
<p>      S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Chola temples, Thompson press, 1975</p>
<p>      p. 269<br />      Ramanathankoil is about 2 KM southwest of Pattisvaram. Pattisvaram,<br />      Ramanathan koil, PalaiyaaRai, TiruccattimuRRam, and Darasuram were<br />      important Chola centers lying close to one another, having formed<br />      an integral part of the ancient secondary Chola capital of <br />    Palaiyaarai.<br />      It is referred to in a record of Kundavai PiraaTTiyaar (ARE 639 of <br />    1909)<br />      as the royal home of her nephew Rajendra I.</p>
<p>      p. 270<br />      An inscription of the seventh year of Rajendra I (ARE 271 of 1927)<br />      found here, mentions a gift of land for worship and offerings, by<br />      the king and a queen of his (NampiraaTTiyaar) made to the "Mahadevar<br />      of Panchavan Maadevi Isvaran, built as a paLLiPPaDai at Palaiyaarai<br />      alias Mudikonda Cholapuram". Provisons ae made for offerings on the<br />      days of Tiruvaadirai, the natal star of Rajendra I, and Revati,<br />      stated there to be that of the (unnamed) queen.</p>
<p>      [... Two paras to establish which Panchavan Maadevi's temple is <br />    this]</p>
<p>      p.271<br />      In view of the many acts of devotion attributed to Queen Panchavan<br />      Maadevi of Rajaraja I, it is highly probable that the paLLiPPaDai<br />      temple was erected over her mortal remains (though Uttama Chola and<br />      Rajendra I had queens of the same name). Though there is no <br />    foundation<br />      inscription revealing its date or builder, it likely that it was<br />      erected by Rajendra I himself in homage to the saintly character of<br />      his step<br />      mother.</p>
<p>      In any event, this temple is unique as the only pallippaDai known<br />      to be erected in honor of a QUEEN.</p>
<p>      p.272<br />      The above inscription makes mention of a mathadhipati Lakulisvara <br />    Pandita<br />      who supervised the affairs of the temple.. We will see while <br />    discussing<br />      Tiruvorriyur, the hold which the Lakulisa and soma Siddhanta cults<br />      had over the Cholas in general, and over Rajendra I in particular.</p>
<p>      p. 307<br />      The Cholas of the Middle and Later periods seem to have been<br />      deeply interested in the Saiva cult called Lakulisa cult.<br />      it is likely that Tiruvorriyur was a strong center of this<br />      cult during these periods, and that this shrine is dedicated to<br />      Lakulisa (corrupted in course of time into Gaulisa).</p>
<p>      Rajadhiraja II is said to have attended a festival in the shrine; <br />    two<br />      gurus, Chaturaanana Pandita and Vagisvara Pandita were also<br />      present on the occasion, and the latter expounded the Soma Siddhanta<br />      (the philosophy of the Kapalika sect of Saivism) in the royal<br />      presence; later all the three listened to a discourse on the<br />      life of Sundaramurti Nayanar (Aludaiya Nambi).</p>
<p>      ******************************************<br />      2) S. R. Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola temples, Orient Longman, 1971<br />      p.213<br />      "Melpadi is situated 6 miles north of Tiruvallam on the<br />      Western bank of Niva river. It occupies an important strategic<br />      position in respect of the northern border of the Chola<br />      dominions."</p>
<p>      p. 214<br />      "Further, this temple is mentioned as the northern boundary of the<br />      new temple of Arinjihai Isvarattu Mahadevar established by<br />      Rajaraja I sometime before his 29th year (A.D. 1014) as a<br />      paLLippaDai (memorial sepulchral temple) built at the place<br />      where the mortal remains of Arinjihai devar were buried<br />      (86 of 1889 and SII, v.3, no17). Here is the relevant extract:<br />      'Sri kO Rajaraja Rajakesari varmaraana Sri Rajaraja Devarkku<br />      yaaNDu (20) 9-vatu JayamkoNDa Chola maNDalattup<br />      perumbaaNappaaDi tuu naatTu MElpaaDiyaana Rajasraya purattu<br />      Arruurt tuJcina devarkkup paLLippadaiyaaha Udaiyaar<br />      Sri rajarajadevar eDuppittaruLina Tiruvarinjihai iisvarattu<br />      Mahadevarkku ...'</p>
<p>      Arinjaya was the grandfather of Rajaraja I and a contemporary<br />      record pays him a great tribute as one 'who possessed keen<br />      intelligence, who was the beloved of the Goddess of Wealth, who was <br />    the<br />      God of Death to his enemies and whose greatness was accompanied<br />      by virtuous character and good qualities'".</p>
<p>      p.216<br />      "It may be of interest to mention that in the days of Rajendra I<br />      its management was in the hands of Lakulisa Pandita, the head of the<br />      mutt of the Saivas of the Pasupata sect."</p>
<p>      ************************************************************<br />      3) S. R. Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola temples, Orient Longman, 1971<br />      p. 101,<br />      "TondaimaanaaD is about 6 miles from Kalahasti.<br />      It was formerly called Tondaimaan Arruur (or Peraarruur) in<br />      AaRRuurnaaDu, a division of TiruvEGkaTak kOTTam in Tondainaadu.<br />      Here is a temple called KodandarAmEsvaram or Adityesvaram. This<br />      is said to be a PallippaDai temple, a tomb temple<br />      erected in honor of Kodandaraamanalias Aditya I. At Tirumalpuram<br />      there is an inscription of the 14th year and 211th day of a<br />      KOnErinmai koNDaan (230 of 1903, SII, v.3, no. 142) which<br />      should be asccribed to Uttama Chola and which mentions an earlier<br />      gift of the 21st year of 'Tondaimaan aaRRuurt tunjiya uDaiyaar'<br />      (he who died at Tondaimaan Arruur) ie., Aditya I."</p>
<p>      " Pallippadai Vagisvara Pandita Bhattaarar Sri Kodandaraamesvaram <br />    aahiya<br />      Adityesvarattu .."</p>
<p>      "for the celebration of a seven-day long festival lasting from<br />      the asterism of kETTai to that of catayam (this being the natal star<br />      of the king) in the month of puraTTaaci for feeding on all seven<br />      days of the festival, a thousand persons, tapasvins of all sects<br />      including Mahavratins, brahmins and devotees of various classes.<br />      It is of special interest that this inscription mentions among<br />      other items the time-honored celebration of the Indra festival<br />      so graphically described in the tamil epics, Silappatikaaram and<br />      Manimekhalai... The sabha and nagaram of Tondaimaan<br />      PeraaRRuur agreed to maintain this charity in favour of the<br />      Pallippadai Vagisvara Pandita Bhattarar temple, as requested by<br />      the Mahavratins of Adityesvaram, the ka.nap perumakka.l of<br />      Panriisvarattu Prithivi Vitangar temple and the Panmahesvaras<br />      (SII, v. 7, no. 529)</p>
<p>      Thus we conclude that this is a temple named after Aditya I,<br />      being in fact a pallippadai, built over the mortal remains<br />      of this king who died in this place. It was built by<br />      Parantaka I sometime before his 34th year as a tangible expression<br />      of the filial piety of a dutiful son"</p>

<p>      On the north wall of the third prakara in the Nataraja temple.</p>
<p>      This inscription, dated in the 10th year, records an order issued by<br />      Solakon for the welfare of his master. It pertains to an exchange of<br />      140 ? 7/8 kuli of land in Pallippadai alias Vikramasolanallur in <br />    which<br />      was situated the temple of Pidari Tiruchchirrambala-Makali, for an<br />      equal extent of land (i.e., 141 kuli) purchased from the temple of<br />      Varanavasi-Mahadeva, according to the sadhana given by Parasavan<br />      Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyan alias Kanakasabhapati-panditan who had the<br />      kani-right of the former temple. This land was made tax-free by <br />    order<br />      of the officer Solakon, for the welfare of Kopperunjingadeva. The<br />      inscription reveals the existence of a committee called<br />      `Nilavaravu-kuttap-perumakkal' which was probably in charge of land<br />      income. Some of the temple authorities mentioned here also figure in<br />      the time of Rajraja III and Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya in a few <br />    records<br />      of the village[6]. The documents connected with this transaction <br />    were<br />      ordered to be preserved in the temple treasury.</p>
<p>      The Pidari temple is stated to have been situated on the southern <br />    side<br />      of the `Vikkiramasolan-tengu-tiruvidi', along which the god (at<br />      Chidambaram) was taken in procession of the sea during festival <br />    days.</p>
<p>      Vikkiramasolanallur is here called Pallippadai, but in No. 275 of <br />    1913<br />      belonging to Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I dated in the 14th regnal <br />    year<br />      perhaps be inferred that the remains of the elder sister (akkan) of<br />      Vikrama-Chola were interred here and that the village called after <br />    the<br />      king as `Vikkiramasolanallur' was founded at this locality.</p>

<p>In the FIRST issue of <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a>, an article<br />under the caption:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Udayaloril Pallippadaya ? is published. In this<br />article, the <br />  details of inscriptions have been gone into.. and<br />  finally ending <br />  saying nothing in the inscription is related to<br />  pallippadai ..</p>
<p>  The details are like this:</p>
<p>  There was a Sivapathasekara Mangalam.. (now known as Udayalur / Near <br />  Pazhayarai @ Patteswaram - which comprises of Ariyapadaiveedu, <br />  pambapadaiveedu (Contonments) ..and nandhipuram (vinagaram !). </p>
<p>  The Siva temple in udayalur conains inscriptions showing this name.</p>
<p>  In Udayalur, there are about 3 temples. <br />  1. Siva Temple. <br />  2. Perumal (Vinnagaram). <br />  3. Paalkulathamman koil (on the banks of a village tank. </p>
<p>  Udayalur Kalyanakrishna B agavathar - propular Harikatha exponent - <br />  hails from this Village. This Agraharam figures in lot of Tamil TV <br />  serials of -late!</p>
<p>  In the entrance pillar of Palkulathaman exists the inscription !<br />  The pillars are used for installing the temple gate and almost half <br />  cemented &amp; painted red - thanks to lack of concern to our History).</p>
<p>  Kudanthai Sethuraman ( of Raman &amp; Raman bus Service<br />  - Industrialist - passed away 20 years back) published a series of <br />  articles way back in 70s - which included an article that this was <br />  related to RRC's samadhi / Pulavar Mahadevan ( of Dhinamalar - now <br />  too) has helped him in these matters.</p>
<p>  (Now retired) Principal of Thiruvaiyaru Arts<br />  College - Dr. Thangamani has supported this view (as Published in <br />  Vikadan Diwali Malar - 2007 - reported in the Gp earlier).</p>
<p>  Kudavoil Dr. Balasubamanian of Thanjavur claimed that the details <br />  are 90% true (as reported in the Junior Vikadan current issue..) but <br />  not 100% ..)</p>
<p>  What is NOT reported widely is THAT THESE <br />  INSCRIPTIONS are FOUND <br />  by the British Archeologists as early in 1927-28<br />  and Published in <br />  the Annual Report of Epigraphy (ARE) under the<br />  heading "Samadhi <br />  Temples " and " Pallipadais"</p>
<p>  Sethuraman quoted apart from this inscription, <br />  other inscriptions <br />  also :</p>
<p>  1. Easana Siva Pandithar (who was the chief Priest<br />  of the Big Temple ) was incharge of Sivapathasekaramangalam<br />  temple !</p>
<p>  2. They were practicing Mahavradham and known as<br />  Mahavradhis. Which<br />  is known as Paasupatha - Laguleesam and this cult<br />  normally maintains Pallippadais and they did maintain the Pallippadai<br />  of Panchavan Madevi - which is located about 3 KMs West of this<br />  temple ! (about 1 KM west of Patteswaram Durgai temple)</p>
<p>  3. The dilapidated MANDAP (Mundril) was renovated -<br />  after the renovator OBSERVED VRADHAMs ! - after about 100<br />  years ! in Kulothunga Period !<br />  (There is an instance where another Dilapidated Siva temple<br />  nearby was renovated, but the renovator DID NOT perform Vradham )</p>
<p>  4. RRC - atleast after making RjC as Heir -<br />  apparent in 1012 AD (both co-ruled for 3 years) - appeared to have<br />  become Godly person </p>
<p>  (Pls go through Archives - Godification of RRC) -<br />  assumed the name<br />  Sivapathasekaran and his idols were kept and<br />  worshipped in the Big<br />  Temple and several other temples including<br />  Papanasam !</p>
<p>  5. Easana Siva Pandithar - who was maintaing Udayalur / Pateswaram <br />  temples - idol is also installed in <br />  in the Big temple and several grants were<br />  accorded! Means he was kept in very high esteem by RRC as<br />  well as RjC!</p>
<p>  6. Through the 4th year inscription of RjC in the Big Temple. we <br />  realise that a VIBOODHI MADAL was also placed in front of PERIYADEVAR <br />  IDOL OF RRC ! </p>
<p>  Summarising ..</p>
<p>  The line of thinking that RRC was Godified and his<br />  mortals were accorded Godly status is not out of place ..</p>
<p>  Whether Udayalur is the Venue is to be decided beyond traces of <br />  doubt ..</p>
<p>  Scholars have taken up this matter to the State Government..</p>
<p>  A detailed excavation may reveal more details..</p>

<p>  ****************************************************<br />    S. R. Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola Art, part I, Asia<br />    Publishing house, 1966 p.18-<br />    "There are also a number of memorial (sepulchral) tomb<br />    temples called paLLippaDai or samAdhi-kOyil. The earliest<br />    epigraphical reference to the building of a pallippadai<br />    is found in an inscription of the 8th year of Vijaya<br />    Kampavarman (886 A.D.) from Cholapuram (429 of 1902 and<br />    EI, vii, p.193). It mentions that Rajaditya, a member<br />    of the Gangeya vamsa bilingual and a subordinate Chief under<br />    Pallava Vijaya Kampavarman, built a memorial Siva temple and<br />    a tomb in memory of his deceased father Prithvigangaraiyar. The<br />    inscription is bilingual. The sanskrit part gives a<br />    part of the genealogy of the Gangas descended from Kongunivarman,<br />    and the tamil part records that Rajaditya built a palippadai<br />    Siva temple in memory of his father and a tomb where his<br />    mortal remains were interred. Here are the relevant lines:<br />    'Ko visaya kamparkku yaaNDu eTTaavatu pritivigangaraiyar<br />    atitar aayina piRpaaDu tatputra Rajadityan Mahadevan<br />    tam appanaarai *paLLippaDutta iDattu* Isvara aalayamum,<br />    atita graramum (grihamum?) eDuppittuk kaNDu (ndu)<br />    sEvittaan'.</p>
<p>    The use of the expression *paLLippaDutta - iDattu* is<br />    siginficant. It means the place where the dead was laid<br />    to eternal rest - a tomb where the bones of the dead were<br />    buried. It seems to have been the practice to bury the dead<br />    in a tomb and also erect a memorial temple in memory of<br />    the dead. (The Ramayana of Valmiki mentions the<br />    'Smasana Chaitya')</p>
<p>    Other important examples are the pallippaDai temples built<br />    by Parantaka I in honor of Aditya I/Kodandaraman/Tondaimaan<br />    Arruur Tunjina Devar alias Arinjaya at Melpadi built by Rajaraja I<br />    in his 29th regnal year (1014 AD) in memory of his grandfather<br />    Arinjaya who died at Arruur- which name seems to refer to<br />    Melpadi itself, on the banks of the Niva or Ponni river.</p>
<p>    "AaRRuur tuJcina tEvarkku paLLippaDaiyaaka Sri Rajaraja<br />    Devar eDuppittaruLina tiru-ariJcikai-iicuvaram"</p>
<p>    The devaraja cult in Indo-china and Indonesia:</p>
<p>    In an excellent guidebook, G. Coedes has devoted two chapters<br />    to the institution in Cambodia similar to that of paLLippaDai<br />    prevalent S. India. He holds that the great majaority of<br />    the statues of "siva, Vishnu, Buddha and other deities found in <br />  Cambodia<br />    were really representations of kings, princes and other<br />    dignitaries in the form of the gods into whom they expected<br />    to be absorbed at the end of their earthly existence.<br />    The "royal essence" was supposed to reside in a linga, or a statue<br />    of siva, vishnu or buddha. What the body was to a person<br />    while alive, that the temple became after the lifetime, namely,<br />    the architectural abode of the God-King. The communion<br />    between the king and the god tookplace thru' the mediation of<br />    the priest on the sacred mountain in the center of the capital.<br />    The devaraja became the palladium of the kingdom. And this<br />    custom prevailed in Cambodia from about the 9th century AD<br />    (if not earlier) to at least the end of the 12th century AD.</p>
<p>    But on account of the despoliation of the monuments by<br />    treasure-hunters, Coedes was unable to establish beyond<br />    doubt if the corpse was interred, or if, as in modern<br />    Cambodia or Thailand, the ashes or bones were enclosed<br />    in an urn after cremation and the urn deposited in a pagoda.<br />    However, he concludes that the monuments from the time<br />    of Jayavarman VII were temples as well as tombs, and ends by<br />    saying that "Angkor Wat was the final habitation of a<br />    being who enjoyed certain devine prerogatives during<br />    his life, and whom death had transformed into a god.<br />    It was a funerary temple".</p>
<p>    The epigraphical evidence in S. India confirms such a<br />    conclusion. The Cholapuram inscription of the 9th<br />    century mentions clearly both an Isvara-alyam<br />    and an atita griham. Usually such funerary temples<br />    were erected over the places of burial of the mortal<br />    remains of ascetics, saints ans sages. One of the latest and most <br />  popular<br />    of such funerary temples in S. India is the that of the<br />    great musician-saint Tyagaraja, on the banks of the river Kaveri.</p>
<p>    We know that the cultural drift was generally from India to SE Asia.<br />    But we do not know whether the personality or devaraja cult had an <br />  earlier<br />    common origin or was an outflow from India or had an independent<br />    parallel development in the two regions. We have to<br />    suspend judgement till such time as we get more light on this<br />    question, and meanwhile, rest satisfied with the knowledge that<br />    similar cults were in existence more or less in the same period<br />    in the land bordering Bay of Bengal, tho' the devaraja cult<br />    of SE asia had its own pecuiar development with its own<br />    individualistic features of its own".</p>

<p>  **********************************************************************<br />  *<br />    1) PALLIPPADAI TEMPLE FOR A CHOLA QUEEN</p>
<p>    Panchavan Maadevi Isvaram</p>
<p>    S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Chola temples, Thompson press, 1975</p>
<p>    p. 269<br />    Ramanathankoil is about 2 KM southwest of Pattisvaram. Pattisvaram,<br />    Ramanathan koil, PalaiyaaRai, TiruccattimuRRam, and Darasuram were<br />    important Chola centers lying close to one another, having formed<br />    an integral part of the ancient secondary Chola capital of <br />  Palaiyaarai.<br />    It is referred to in a record of Kundavai PiraaTTiyaar (ARE 639 of <br />  1909)<br />    as the royal home of her nephew Rajendra I.</p>
<p>    p. 270<br />    An inscription of the seventh year of Rajendra I (ARE 271 of 1927)<br />    found here, mentions a gift of land for worship and offerings, by<br />    the king and a queen of his (NampiraaTTiyaar) made to the "Mahadevar<br />    of Panchavan Maadevi Isvaran, built as a paLLiPPaDai at Palaiyaarai<br />    alias Mudikonda Cholapuram". Provisons ae made for offerings on the<br />    days of Tiruvaadirai, the natal star of Rajendra I, and Revati,<br />    stated there to be that of the (unnamed) queen.</p>
<p>    [... Two paras to establish which Panchavan Maadevi's temple is <br />  this]</p>
<p>    p.271<br />    In view of the many acts of devotion attributed to Queen Panchavan<br />    Maadevi of Rajaraja I, it is highly probable that the paLLiPPaDai<br />    temple was erected over her mortal remains (though Uttama Chola and<br />    Rajendra I had queens of the same name). Though there is no <br />  foundation<br />    inscription revealing its date or builder, it likely that it was<br />    erected by Rajendra I himself in homage to the saintly character of<br />    his step<br />    mother.</p>
<p>    In any event, this temple is unique as the only pallippaDai known<br />    to be erected in honor of a QUEEN.</p>
<p>    p.272<br />    The above inscription makes mention of a mathadhipati Lakulisvara <br />  Pandita<br />    who supervised the affairs of the temple.. We will see while <br />  discussing<br />    Tiruvorriyur, the hold which the Lakulisa and soma Siddhanta cults<br />    had over the Cholas in general, and over Rajendra I in particular.</p>
<p>    p. 307<br />    The Cholas of the Middle and Later periods seem to have been<br />    deeply interested in the Saiva cult called Lakulisa cult.<br />    it is likely that Tiruvorriyur was a strong center of this<br />    cult during these periods, and that this shrine is dedicated to<br />    Lakulisa (corrupted in course of time into Gaulisa).</p>
<p>    Rajadhiraja II is said to have attended a festival in the shrine; <br />  two<br />    gurus, Chaturaanana Pandita and Vagisvara Pandita were also<br />    present on the occasion, and the latter expounded the Soma Siddhanta<br />    (the philosophy of the Kapalika sect of Saivism) in the royal<br />    presence; later all the three listened to a discourse on the<br />    life of Sundaramurti Nayanar (Aludaiya Nambi).</p>
<p>    ******************************************<br />    2) S. R. Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola temples, Orient Longman, 1971<br />    p.213<br />    "Melpadi is situated 6 miles north of Tiruvallam on the<br />    Western bank of Niva river. It occupies an important strategic<br />    position in respect of the northern border of the Chola<br />    dominions."</p>
<p>    p. 214<br />    "Further, this temple is mentioned as the northern boundary of the<br />    new temple of Arinjihai Isvarattu Mahadevar established by<br />    Rajaraja I sometime before his 29th year (A.D. 1014) as a<br />    paLLippaDai (memorial sepulchral temple) built at the place<br />    where the mortal remains of Arinjihai devar were buried<br />    (86 of 1889 and SII, v.3, no17). Here is the relevant extract:<br />    'Sri kO Rajaraja Rajakesari varmaraana Sri Rajaraja Devarkku<br />    yaaNDu (20) 9-vatu JayamkoNDa Chola maNDalattup<br />    perumbaaNappaaDi tuu naatTu MElpaaDiyaana Rajasraya purattu<br />    Arruurt tuJcina devarkkup paLLippadaiyaaha Udaiyaar<br />    Sri rajarajadevar eDuppittaruLina Tiruvarinjihai iisvarattu<br />    Mahadevarkku ...'</p>
<p>    Arinjaya was the grandfather of Rajaraja I and a contemporary<br />    record pays him a great tribute as one 'who possessed keen<br />    intelligence, who was the beloved of the Goddess of Wealth, who was <br />  the<br />    God of Death to his enemies and whose greatness was accompanied<br />    by virtuous character and good qualities'".</p>
<p>    p.216<br />    "It may be of interest to mention that in the days of Rajendra I<br />    its management was in the hands of Lakulisa Pandita, the head of the<br />    mutt of the Saivas of the Pasupata sect."</p>
<p>    ************************************************************<br />    3) S. R. Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola temples, Orient Longman, 1971<br />    p. 101,<br />    "TondaimaanaaD is about 6 miles from Kalahasti.<br />    It was formerly called Tondaimaan Arruur (or Peraarruur) in<br />    AaRRuurnaaDu, a division of TiruvEGkaTak kOTTam in Tondainaadu.<br />    Here is a temple called KodandarAmEsvaram or Adityesvaram. This<br />    is said to be a PallippaDai temple, a tomb temple<br />    erected in honor of Kodandaraamanalias Aditya I. At Tirumalpuram<br />    there is an inscription of the 14th year and 211th day of a<br />    KOnErinmai koNDaan (230 of 1903, SII, v.3, no. 142) which<br />    should be asccribed to Uttama Chola and which mentions an earlier<br />    gift of the 21st year of 'Tondaimaan aaRRuurt tunjiya uDaiyaar'<br />    (he who died at Tondaimaan Arruur) ie., Aditya I."</p>
<p>    " Pallippadai Vagisvara Pandita Bhattaarar Sri Kodandaraamesvaram <br />  aahiya<br />    Adityesvarattu .."</p>
<p>    "for the celebration of a seven-day long festival lasting from<br />    the asterism of kETTai to that of catayam (this being the natal star<br />    of the king) in the month of puraTTaaci for feeding on all seven<br />    days of the festival, a thousand persons, tapasvins of all sects<br />    including Mahavratins, brahmins and devotees of various classes.<br />    It is of special interest that this inscription mentions among<br />    other items the time-honored celebration of the Indra festival<br />    so graphically described in the tamil epics, Silappatikaaram and<br />    Manimekhalai... The sabha and nagaram of Tondaimaan<br />    PeraaRRuur agreed to maintain this charity in favour of the<br />    Pallippadai Vagisvara Pandita Bhattarar temple, as requested by<br />    the Mahavratins of Adityesvaram, the ka.nap perumakka.l of<br />    Panriisvarattu Prithivi Vitangar temple and the Panmahesvaras<br />    (SII, v. 7, no. 529)</p>
<p>    Thus we conclude that this is a temple named after Aditya I,<br />    being in fact a pallippadai, built over the mortal remains<br />    of this king who died in this place. It was built by<br />    Parantaka I sometime before his 34th year as a tangible expression<br />    of the filial piety of a dutiful son"</p>

<p>    Chidambaram, Chidambaram Taluk, South Arcot District.</p>
<p>    On the north wall of the third prakara in the Nataraja temple.</p>
<p>    This inscription, dated in the 10th year, records an order issued by<br />    Solakon for the welfare of his master. It pertains to an exchange of<br />    140 ? 7/8 kuli of land in Pallippadai alias Vikramasolanallur in <br />  which<br />    was situated the temple of Pidari Tiruchchirrambala-Makali, for an<br />    equal extent of land (i.e., 141 kuli) purchased from the temple of<br />    Varanavasi-Mahadeva, according to the sadhana given by Parasavan<br />    Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyan alias Kanakasabhapati-panditan who had the<br />    kani-right of the former temple. This land was made tax-free by <br />  order<br />    of the officer Solakon, for the welfare of Kopperunjingadeva. The<br />    inscription reveals the existence of a committee called<br />    `Nilavaravu-kuttap-perumakkal' which was probably in charge of land<br />    income. Some of the temple authorities mentioned here also figure in<br />    the time of Rajraja III and Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya in a few <br />  records<br />    of the village[6]. The documents connected with this transaction <br />  were<br />    ordered to be preserved in the temple treasury.</p>
<p>    The Pidari temple is stated to have been situated on the southern <br />  side<br />    of the `Vikkiramasolan-tengu-tiruvidi', along which the god (at<br />    Chidambaram) was taken in procession of the sea during festival <br />  days.</p>
<p>    Vikkiramasolanallur is here called Pallippadai, but in No. 275 of <br />  1913<br />    belonging to Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I dated in the 14th regnal <br />  year<br />    perhaps be inferred that the remains of the elder sister (akkan) of<br />    Vikrama-Chola were interred here and that the village called after <br />  the<br />    king as `Vikkiramasolanallur' was founded at this locality.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>IT is interesting to go through these details again on the auspicious <br />occasion of Most Rev.

<p>The Sainthood is accorded since a physically challenged child got <br />cured sometime back after praying in front of the Tomb of (St) Most <br />Rev Alphonsa !</p>

<blockquote><p>  In the FIRST issue of <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a>, an article<br />under the caption:</p></blockquote>
<p>Udayaloril Pallippadaya ? is published. In this<br />article, the <br />details of inscriptions have been gone into.. and<br />finally ending <br />saying nothing in the inscription is related to<br />pallippadai ..</p>
<p>The details are like this:</p>
<p>There was a Sivapathasekara Mangalam.. (now known as Udayalur / Near <br />Pazhayarai @ Patteswaram - which comprises of Ariyapadaiveedu, <br />pambapadaiveedu (Contonments) ..and nandhipuram (vinagaram !). </p>
<p>The Siva temple in udayalur conains inscriptions showing this name.</p>
<p>In Udayalur, there are about 3 temples. <br />1. Siva Temple. <br />2. Perumal (Vinnagaram). <br />3. Paalkulathamman koil (on the banks of a village tank. </p>
<p>Udayalur Kalyanakrishna B agavathar - propular Harikatha exponent - <br />hails from this Village. This Agraharam figures in lot of Tamil TV <br />serials of -late!</p>
<p>In the entrance pillar of Palkulathaman exists the inscription !<br />The pillars are used for installing the temple gate and almost half <br />cemented &amp; painted red - thanks to lack of concern to our History).</p>
<p>Kudanthai Sethuraman ( of Raman &amp; Raman bus Service<br />- Industrialist - passed away 20 years back) published a series of <br />articles way back in 70s - which included an article that this was <br />related to RRC's samadhi / Pulavar Mahadevan ( of Dhinamalar - now <br />too) has helped him in these matters.</p>
<p>(Now retired) Principal of Thiruvaiyaru Arts<br />College - Dr. Thangamani has supported this view (as Published in <br />Vikadan Diwali Malar - 2007 - reported in the Gp earlier).</p>
<p>Kudavoil Dr. Balasubamanian of Thanjavur claimed that the details <br />are 90% true (as reported in the Junior Vikadan current issue..) but <br />not 100% ..)</p>
<p>What is NOT reported widely is THAT THESE <br />INSCRIPTIONS are FOUND <br />by the British Archeologists as early in 1927-28<br />and Published in <br />the Annual Report of Epigraphy (ARE) under the<br />heading "Samadhi <br />Temples " and " Pallipadais"</p>
<p>Sethuraman quoted apart from this inscription, <br />other inscriptions <br />also :</p>
<p>1. Easana Siva Pandithar (who was the chief Priest<br />of the Big Temple ) was incharge of Sivapathasekaramangalam<br />temple !</p>
<p>2. They were practicing Mahavradham and known as<br />Mahavradhis. Which<br />is known as Paasupatha - Laguleesam and this cult<br />normally maintains Pallippadais and they did maintain the Pallippadai<br />of Panchavan Madevi - which is located about 3 KMs West of this<br />temple ! (about 1 KM west of Patteswaram Durgai temple)</p>
<p>3. The dilapidated MANDAP (Mundril) was renovated -<br />after the renovator OBSERVED VRADHAMs ! - after about 100<br />years ! in Kulothunga Period !<br />(There is an instance where another Dilapidated Siva temple<br />nearby was renovated, but the renovator DID NOT perform Vradham )</p>
<p>4. RRC - atleast after making RjC as Heir -<br />apparent in 1012 AD (both co-ruled for 3 years) - appeared to have<br />become Godly person </p>
<p>(Pls go through Archives - Godification of RRC) -<br />assumed the name<br />Sivapathasekaran and his idols were kept and<br />worshipped in the Big<br />Temple and several other temples including<br />Papanasam !</p>
<p>5. Easana Siva Pandithar - who was maintaing Udayalur / Pateswaram <br />temples - idol is also installed in <br />in the Big temple and several grants were<br />accorded! Means he was kept in very high esteem by RRC as<br />well as RjC!</p>
<p>6. Through the 4th year inscription of RjC in the Big Temple. we <br />realise that a VIBOODHI MADAL was also placed in front of PERIYADEVAR <br />IDOL OF RRC ! </p>
<p>Summarising ..</p>
<p>The line of thinking that RRC was Godified and his<br />mortals were accorded Godly status is not out of place ..</p>
<p>Whether Udayalur is the Venue is to be decided beyond traces of <br />doubt ..</p>
<p>Scholars have taken up this matter to the State Government..</p>
<p>A detailed excavation may reveal more details..</p>

<blockquote><p>  S. R. Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola Art, part I, Asia<br />  Publishing house, 1966 p.18-<br />  "There are also a number of memorial (sepulchral) tomb<br />  temples called paLLippaDai or samAdhi-kOyil. The earliest<br />  epigraphical reference to the building of a pallippadai<br />  is found in an inscription of the 8th year of Vijaya<br />  Kampavarman (886 A.D.) from Cholapuram (429 of 1902 and<br />  EI, vii, p.193). It mentions that Rajaditya, a member<br />  of the Gangeya vamsa bilingual and a subordinate Chief under<br />  Pallava Vijaya Kampavarman, built a memorial Siva temple and<br />  a tomb in memory of his deceased father Prithvigangaraiyar. The<br />  inscription is bilingual. The sanskrit part gives a<br />  part of the genealogy of the Gangas descended from Kongunivarman,<br />  and the tamil part records that Rajaditya built a palippadai<br />  Siva temple in memory of his father and a tomb where his<br />  mortal remains were interred. Here are the relevant lines:<br />  'Ko visaya kamparkku yaaNDu eTTaavatu pritivigangaraiyar<br />  atitar aayina piRpaaDu tatputra Rajadityan Mahadevan<br />  tam appanaarai *paLLippaDutta iDattu* Isvara aalayamum,<br />  atita graramum (grihamum?) eDuppittuk kaNDu (ndu)<br />  sEvittaan'.</p>
<p>  The use of the expression *paLLippaDutta - iDattu* is<br />  siginficant. It means the place where the dead was laid<br />  to eternal rest - a tomb where the bones of the dead were<br />  buried. It seems to have been the practice to bury the dead<br />  in a tomb and also erect a memorial temple in memory of<br />  the dead. (The Ramayana of Valmiki mentions the<br />  'Smasana Chaitya')</p>
<p>  Other important examples are the pallippaDai temples built<br />  by Parantaka I in honor of Aditya I/Kodandaraman/Tondaimaan<br />  Arruur Tunjina Devar alias Arinjaya at Melpadi built by Rajaraja I<br />  in his 29th regnal year (1014 AD) in memory of his grandfather<br />  Arinjaya who died at Arruur- which name seems to refer to<br />  Melpadi itself, on the banks of the Niva or Ponni river.</p>
<p>  "AaRRuur tuJcina tEvarkku paLLippaDaiyaaka Sri Rajaraja<br />  Devar eDuppittaruLina tiru-ariJcikai-iicuvaram"</p>
<p>  The devaraja cult in Indo-china and Indonesia:</p>
<p>  In an excellent guidebook, G. Coedes has devoted two chapters<br />  to the institution in Cambodia similar to that of paLLippaDai<br />  prevalent S. India. He holds that the great majaority of<br />  the statues of "siva, Vishnu, Buddha and other deities found in <br />Cambodia<br />  were really representations of kings, princes and other<br />  dignitaries in the form of the gods into whom they expected<br />  to be absorbed at the end of their earthly existence.<br />  The "royal essence" was supposed to reside in a linga, or a statue<br />  of siva, vishnu or buddha. What the body was to a person<br />  while alive, that the temple became after the lifetime, namely,<br />  the architectural abode of the God-King. The communion<br />  between the king and the god tookplace thru' the mediation of<br />  the priest on the sacred mountain in the center of the capital.<br />  The devaraja became the palladium of the kingdom. And this<br />  custom prevailed in Cambodia from about the 9th century AD<br />  (if not earlier) to at least the end of the 12th century AD.</p>
<p>  But on account of the despoliation of the monuments by<br />  treasure-hunters, Coedes was unable to establish beyond<br />  doubt if the corpse was interred, or if, as in modern<br />  Cambodia or Thailand, the ashes or bones were enclosed<br />  in an urn after cremation and the urn deposited in a pagoda.<br />  However, he concludes that the monuments from the time<br />  of Jayavarman VII were temples as well as tombs, and ends by<br />  saying that "Angkor Wat was the final habitation of a<br />  being who enjoyed certain devine prerogatives during<br />  his life, and whom death had transformed into a god.<br />  It was a funerary temple".</p>
<p>  The epigraphical evidence in S. India confirms such a<br />  conclusion. The Cholapuram inscription of the 9th<br />  century mentions clearly both an Isvara-alyam<br />  and an atita griham. Usually such funerary temples<br />  were erected over the places of burial of the mortal<br />  remains of ascetics, saints ans sages. One of the latest and most <br />popular<br />  of such funerary temples in S. India is the that of the<br />  great musician-saint Tyagaraja, on the banks of the river Kaveri.</p>
<p>  We know that the cultural drift was generally from India to SE Asia.<br />  But we do not know whether the personality or devaraja cult had an <br />earlier<br />  common origin or was an outflow from India or had an independent<br />  parallel development in the two regions. We have to<br />  suspend judgement till such time as we get more light on this<br />  question, and meanwhile, rest satisfied with the knowledge that<br />  similar cults were in existence more or less in the same period<br />  in the land bordering Bay of Bengal, tho' the devaraja cult<br />  of SE asia had its own pecuiar development with its own<br />  individualistic features of its own".</p>

<blockquote><p>  1) PALLIPPADAI TEMPLE FOR A CHOLA QUEEN</p>
<p>  Panchavan Maadevi Isvaram</p>
<p>  S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Chola temples, Thompson press, 1975</p>
<p>  p. 269<br />  Ramanathankoil is about 2 KM southwest of Pattisvaram. Pattisvaram,<br />  Ramanathan koil, PalaiyaaRai, TiruccattimuRRam, and Darasuram were<br />  important Chola centers lying close to one another, having formed<br />  an integral part of the ancient secondary Chola capital of <br />Palaiyaarai.<br />  It is referred to in a record of Kundavai PiraaTTiyaar (ARE 639 of <br />1909)<br />  as the royal home of her nephew Rajendra I.</p>
<p>  p. 270<br />  An inscription of the seventh year of Rajendra I (ARE 271 of 1927)<br />  found here, mentions a gift of land for worship and offerings, by<br />  the king and a queen of his (NampiraaTTiyaar) made to the "Mahadevar<br />  of Panchavan Maadevi Isvaran, built as a paLLiPPaDai at Palaiyaarai<br />  alias Mudikonda Cholapuram". Provisons ae made for offerings on the<br />  days of Tiruvaadirai, the natal star of Rajendra I, and Revati,<br />  stated there to be that of the (unnamed) queen.</p>
<p>  [... Two paras to establish which Panchavan Maadevi's temple is <br />this]</p>
<p>  p.271<br />  In view of the many acts of devotion attributed to Queen Panchavan<br />  Maadevi of Rajaraja I, it is highly probable that the paLLiPPaDai<br />  temple was erected over her mortal remains (though Uttama Chola and<br />  Rajendra I had queens of the same name). Though there is no <br />foundation<br />  inscription revealing its date or builder, it likely that it was<br />  erected by Rajendra I himself in homage to the saintly character of<br />  his step<br />  mother.</p>
<p>  In any event, this temple is unique as the only pallippaDai known<br />  to be erected in honor of a QUEEN.</p>
<p>  p.272<br />  The above inscription makes mention of a mathadhipati Lakulisvara <br />Pandita<br />  who supervised the affairs of the temple.. We will see while <br />discussing<br />  Tiruvorriyur, the hold which the Lakulisa and soma Siddhanta cults<br />  had over the Cholas in general, and over Rajendra I in particular.</p>
<p>  p. 307<br />  The Cholas of the Middle and Later periods seem to have been<br />  deeply interested in the Saiva cult called Lakulisa cult.<br />  it is likely that Tiruvorriyur was a strong center of this<br />  cult during these periods, and that this shrine is dedicated to<br />  Lakulisa (corrupted in course of time into Gaulisa).</p>
<p>  Rajadhiraja II is said to have attended a festival in the shrine; <br />two<br />  gurus, Chaturaanana Pandita and Vagisvara Pandita were also<br />  present on the occasion, and the latter expounded the Soma Siddhanta<br />  (the philosophy of the Kapalika sect of Saivism) in the royal<br />  presence; later all the three listened to a discourse on the<br />  life of Sundaramurti Nayanar (Aludaiya Nambi).</p>

Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola temples, Orient Longman, 1971<br />  p.213<br />  "Melpadi is situated 6 miles north of Tiruvallam on the<br />  Western bank of Niva river. It occupies an important strategic<br />  position in respect of the northern border of the Chola<br />  dominions."</p>
<p>  p. 214<br />  "Further, this temple is mentioned as the northern boundary of the<br />  new temple of Arinjihai Isvarattu Mahadevar established by<br />  Rajaraja I sometime before his 29th year (A.D. 1014) as a<br />  paLLippaDai (memorial sepulchral temple) built at the place<br />  where the mortal remains of Arinjihai devar were buried<br />  (86 of 1889 and SII, v.3, no17). Here is the relevant extract:<br />  'Sri kO Rajaraja Rajakesari varmaraana Sri Rajaraja Devarkku<br />  yaaNDu (20) 9-vatu JayamkoNDa Chola maNDalattup<br />  perumbaaNappaaDi tuu naatTu MElpaaDiyaana Rajasraya purattu<br />  Arruurt tuJcina devarkkup paLLippadaiyaaha Udaiyaar<br />  Sri rajarajadevar eDuppittaruLina Tiruvarinjihai iisvarattu<br />  Mahadevarkku ...'</p>
<p>  Arinjaya was the grandfather of Rajaraja I and a contemporary<br />  record pays him a great tribute as one 'who possessed keen<br />  intelligence, who was the beloved of the Goddess of Wealth, who was <br />the<br />  God of Death to his enemies and whose greatness was accompanied<br />  by virtuous character and good qualities'".</p>
<p>  p.216<br />  "It may be of interest to mention that in the days of Rajendra I<br />  its management was in the hands of Lakulisa Pandita, the head of the<br />  mutt of the Saivas of the Pasupata sect."</p>
<p>  ************************************************************<br />  3) S. R. Balsubrahmanyam, Early Chola temples, Orient Longman, 1971<br />  p. 101,<br />  "TondaimaanaaD is about 6 miles from Kalahasti.<br />  It was formerly called Tondaimaan Arruur (or Peraarruur) in<br />  AaRRuurnaaDu, a division of TiruvEGkaTak kOTTam in Tondainaadu.<br />  Here is a temple called KodandarAmEsvaram or Adityesvaram. This<br />  is said to be a PallippaDai temple, a tomb temple<br />  erected in honor of Kodandaraamanalias Aditya I. At Tirumalpuram<br />  there is an inscription of the 14th year and 211th day of a<br />  KOnErinmai koNDaan (230 of 1903, SII, v.3, no. 142) which<br />  should be asccribed to Uttama Chola and which mentions an earlier<br />  gift of the 21st year of 'Tondaimaan aaRRuurt tunjiya uDaiyaar'<br />  (he who died at Tondaimaan Arruur) ie., Aditya I."</p>
<p>  " Pallippadai Vagisvara Pandita Bhattaarar Sri Kodandaraamesvaram <br />aahiya<br />  Adityesvarattu .."</p>
<p>  "for the celebration of a seven-day long festival lasting from<br />  the asterism of kETTai to that of catayam (this being the natal star<br />  of the king) in the month of puraTTaaci for feeding on all seven<br />  days of the festival, a thousand persons, tapasvins of all sects<br />  including Mahavratins, brahmins and devotees of various classes.<br />  It is of special interest that this inscription mentions among<br />  other items the time-honored celebration of the Indra festival<br />  so graphically described in the tamil epics, Silappatikaaram and<br />  Manimekhalai... The sabha and nagaram of Tondaimaan<br />  PeraaRRuur agreed to maintain this charity in favour of the<br />  Pallippadai Vagisvara Pandita Bhattarar temple, as requested by<br />  the Mahavratins of Adityesvaram, the ka.nap perumakka.l of<br />  Panriisvarattu Prithivi Vitangar temple and the Panmahesvaras<br />  (SII, v. 7, no. 529)</p>
<p>  Thus we conclude that this is a temple named after Aditya I,<br />  being in fact a pallippadai, built over the mortal remains<br />  of this king who died in this place. It was built by<br />  Parantaka I sometime before his 34th year as a tangible expression<br />  of the filial piety of a dutiful son"</p>

<p>  Chidambaram, Chidambaram Taluk, South Arcot District.</p>
<p>  On the north wall of the third prakara in the Nataraja temple.</p>
<p>  This inscription, dated in the 10th year, records an order issued by<br />  Solakon for the welfare of his master. It pertains to an exchange of<br />  140 ? 7/8 kuli of land in Pallippadai alias Vikramasolanallur in <br />which<br />  was situated the temple of Pidari Tiruchchirrambala-Makali, for an<br />  equal extent of land (i.e., 141 kuli) purchased from the temple of<br />  Varanavasi-Mahadeva, according to the sadhana given by Parasavan<br />  Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyan alias Kanakasabhapati-panditan who had the<br />  kani-right of the former temple. This land was made tax-free by <br />order<br />  of the officer Solakon, for the welfare of Kopperunjingadeva. The<br />  inscription reveals the existence of a committee called<br />  `Nilavaravu-kuttap-perumakkal' which was probably in charge of land<br />  income. Some of the temple authorities mentioned here also figure in<br />  the time of Rajraja III and Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya in a few <br />records<br />  of the village[6]. The documents connected with this transaction <br />were<br />  ordered to be preserved in the temple treasury.</p>
<p>  The Pidari temple is stated to have been situated on the southern <br />side<br />  of the `Vikkiramasolan-tengu-tiruvidi', along which the god (at<br />  Chidambaram) was taken in procession of the sea during festival <br />days.</p>
<p>  Vikkiramasolanallur is here called Pallippadai, but in No. 275 of <br />1913<br />  belonging to Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I dated in the 14th regnal <br />year<br />  perhaps be inferred that the remains of the elder sister (akkan) of<br />  Vikrama-Chola were interred here and that the village called after <br />the<br />  king as `Vikkiramasolanallur' was founded at this locality.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Stonehenge Could Have Been Resting Place For Royalty</p></blockquote>
<p>Hi vijay<br />these stone structures above burial spots were common in that age.<br />we have one near guduvanjery discovered by gift siromoney<br />megaliths, or dolmen(??)</p>
<p>must have been to mark the place or protect the corpse from wild <br />animals. then ego crept in My grand father's burial stone is bigger <br />than yours type.</p>
<p>here is a small write up from gift siromoney's page</p>
<p>Around 300 B.C., there were people of the Iron Age living in Tambaram <br />area and they built their burial monuments in the form of dolmens and <br />stone circles which are called Megaliths (big stones). Fine examples <br />of such Megalithic Monuments can be seen about 100 metres east of the <br />Great Southern Trunk Road near Guduvancheri railway station.</p>

<p>  The Sheffield archaeologists, Professor Mike Parker-Pearson and <br />  Professor Andrew Chamberlain, believe that the cremation burials <br />  could represent the natural deaths of a single elite family and its <br />  descendants, perhaps a ruling dynasty. One clue to this is the <br />small <br />  number of burials in Stonehenge?s earliest phase, a number that <br />  grows larger in subsequent centuries, as offspring would have <br />  multiplied.</p>
<p>  Many archaeologists previously believed that people had been buried <br />  at Stonehenge only between 2700 and 2600 B.C., before the large <br />  stones, known as sarsens, were put in place. The new dates provide <br />  strong clues about the original purpose of the monument and show <br />  that its use as a cemetery extended for more than 500 years.</p>
<p>  The earliest cremation burial dated ? a small pile of burned bones <br />  and teeth ? came from one of the pits around Stonehenge?s edge <br />known <br />  as the Aubrey Holes and dates to 3030-2880 B.C., roughly the time <br />  when Stonehenge?s ditch-and-bank monument was cut into Salisbury <br />  Plain.</p>
<p>  The second burial, from the ditch surrounding Stonehenge, is that <br />of <br />  an adult and dates to 2930-2870 B.C. The most recent cremation <br />comes <br />  from the ditch?s northern side and was of a 25-year-old woman; it <br />  dates to 2570-2340 B.C., around the time the first arrangements of <br />  sarsen stones appeared at Stonehenge.</p>
<p>  This is the first time any of the cremation burials from Stonehenge <br />  have been radiocarbon dated. The burials dated were excavated in <br />the <br />  1950s and have been kept at the nearby Salisbury Museum.</p>
<p>  Another 49 cremation burials were dug up at Stonehenge during the <br />  1920s, but all were put back in the ground because they were <br />thought <br />  to be of no scientific value. Archaeologists estimate that up to <br />240 <br />  people were buried within Stonehenge, all as cremation deposits.</p>
<p>  The latest findings are the result of the Stonehenge Riverside <br />  Project, a collaboration between five UK universities, which is <br />  funded by the National Geographic Society and the Arts and <br />  Humanities Research Council (AHRC), with support from English <br />  Heritage. The project?s last digging season near Stonehenge saw <br />  excavation of houses at nearby Durrington Walls, the precise dating <br />  of Stonehenge?s cursus ? the ditched enclosure nearly two miles <br />long <br />  that has long puzzled archaeologists ? and new discoveries about <br />  the "Cuckoo Stone" and the timber monuments south of Woodhenge.</p>
<p>  Professor Mike Parker-Pearson, from the Department of Archaeology <br />at <br />  the University of Sheffield, who leads the Stonehenge Riverside <br />  Archaeological Project, said: "I don?t think it was the common <br />  people getting buried at Stonehenge ? it was clearly a special <br />place <br />  at that time. One has to assume anyone buried there had some good <br />  credentials.</p>
<p>  "The people buried here must have been drawn from a very small and <br />  select living population. Archaeologists have long speculated about <br />  whether Stonehenge was put up by prehistoric chiefs ? perhaps even <br />  ancient royalty ? and the new results suggest that not only is this <br />  likely to have been the case but it also was the resting place of <br />  their mortal remains</p>
