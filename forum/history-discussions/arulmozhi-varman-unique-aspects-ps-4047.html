<p>Just thought I could summarize some of the unique features of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  as<br />compared to other historic novels written in Tamil -</acronym></p>
<p>* Most of the novels have a big invasion or fighting between 2<br />kingdoms as their climax. The entire novel will be moving towards<br />this event and the author would have supported one side - portraying<br />the other as the evil force. Kalki's own <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  is no exception to this.</p>
<p>But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is different in this respect - to a careful observer it will<br />be evident that the novel does'nt have a climax on its own ! Kalki<br />felt that the renunciation of Crown by Arulmizhi was his climax<br />(refer his conclusion to the novel) - to many readers it is the<br />murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither or both. That is why when<br />you finish the novel, you always suffer from a sort of<br />dissatisfaction - no other novel can give this feeling - that too at<br />the end of 5th volume !</acronym></p>
<p>* Most of the novels have a King or a prince as its hero ? but in<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym <br />a small, insignificant and noble warrior (Vandhiyathevan) becomes a<br />hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki actually wanted Arulmozhi<br />to be recognized as a hero in his novel ? the name Ponniyin<br />selvan is<br />derived from him ? but an `all perfect' figure he<br />portrayed only<br />helped to distance readers from Arulmizhi. Moreover the chronology of<br />events was also in favour of Vandhiyathevan. It is interesting to<br />compare Vandhiyathevan with Paranjothi ? who is a character in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym <br />and<br />Ponnan of Parthiban Kanavu. In <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  Paranjothi character is used to<br />introduce many characters in the Novel ? but the real hero is<br />Narasimhavarman. It is certain that Kalki wanted to adopt a similar<br />technique but somehow Vandhiyathevan triumphed over his own creator !</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>* Usually such long historic stories have to portray some breaks in<br />timeline (invariably). For example, in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  the last part happens after<br />a gap of 9 years. But <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  portrays events continuously for a period of<br />6 months. If you trace back carefully, you can actually find out who<br />was doing what for almost every day ? for a period of 6 months.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>* Probably its portrayal of simultaneous happenings in many many<br />places is unique to Tamil historic novel genere. At some point of<br />time, he will be detailing different events happening in Srilanka,<br />Tanjore, Pazhaiyarai, Kudanthai and Kadambur ? and yet ?<br />with master<br />craftsmanship ? will link them in a very logical order ? as<br />pages<br />move by?</p>
<p>* Its characterization of people is a well discussed and well<br />researched topic</p>
<p>* This is probably the only novel in which we see almost all kinds of<br />love between human beings portrayed ?<br />- Vandhiyathevan and Kundhavai who are in love with each other since<br />their first sight.<br />- Poonguzhali's love for Arulmozhi and her compromise to marry<br />Amudhan<br />- Arulmozhi's interest in Poonguzhali and his compromise to marry<br />vanathi<br />- Vanathi's love towords Arulmizhi<br />- Amudhan's love towords Poonguzhali<br />- Nandhini's love towords Aditya and her revenge<br />- Aditya's love towords Nandhini<br />- Parthibendhran's love towords Nandhini<br />- Pazhuvettaraiyar's interest in Nandhini<br />- Manimekalai's love towords Vandhiyathevan</p>
<p>Initially I thought of categorizing them (like one sided love, two<br />sided love etc) but I find that it is difficult to do ? given the<br />wide spectrum of relationship kalki portrays</p>
<p>* <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is perhaps the only novel in which the story is not entirely<br />dominated by Hero. Sometimes I think <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  has different heros at<br />different points of time?<br />- In Pallipadai events (Part I) Azvarkadiyan sounds like a hero<br />- In Nilavarai and many other occations, ofcourse<br />Vandhiyathevan dominates<br />- In Part II Arulmozhi dominates in many occasions<br />- Sendhan amudhan surprisingly dominates certain portains in<br />Part IV and V (During Mandakini escape from Pallakku, when he becomes<br />royal heir etc)<br />- During the aftermath of floods (Part IV), Pazhuvettaraiyar<br />certainly becomes a hero for a chapter or two<br />Thus it is close to real life in which different people become heros<br />at different points of time.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>* Surprise ! <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  seems to have no villains ! (or rather everybody seem<br />to have enough justifications) Nandhini might sound like a villi but<br />after reading her childhood we understand that there are enough<br />reasons behind her abhorrence. Ravidasan ? Soman sambavan ? Remember<br />?<br />they had vowed to give their life in case they fail to protect their<br />leader. But instead they choose to live and take revenge. They<br />undergo so many troubles to achieve their goal. Considering the<br />cruelty of Pandiya's murder ? this can be understood.<br />In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with possible<br />realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.</acronym></p>
<p>I initially though of writing a small mail ? but this is close to<br />becoming an article. I can write many things like this?.and yet<br />may<br />not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this greatest<br />historic novel ever written.</p>
<p>Your comments are welcome.<br />Cheers !<br />Gokul.</p>

<p>            Just thought I could summarize some of the<br />    unique features of<br />    PS<br />      as<br />            compared to other historic novels written in<br />    Tamil -</p>
<p>            * Most of the novels have a big invasion or<br />    fighting between 2<br />            kingdoms as their climax. The entire novel<br />    will be moving<br />    towards<br />            this event and the author would have<br />    supported one side -<br />          portraying<br />            the other as the evil force. Kalki's own SS<br />    is no exception to<br />          this.</p>
<p>            But PS is different in this respect - to a<br />    careful observer it<br />      will<br />            be evident that the novel does'nt have a<br />    climax on its own !<br />    Kalki<br />            felt that the renunciation of Crown by<br />    Arulmizhi was his<br />    climax<br />            (refer his conclusion to the novel) - to<br />    many readers it is<br />    the<br />            murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither<br />    or both. That is<br />    why<br />          when<br />            you finish the novel, you always suffer from<br />    a sort of<br />            dissatisfaction - no other novel can give<br />    this feeling - that<br />    too<br />          at<br />            the end of 5th volume !</p>
<p>            * Most of the novels have a King or a prince<br />    as its hero ? but<br />      in<br />            PS<br />            a small, insignificant and noble warrior<br />    (Vandhiyathevan)<br />    becomes<br />      a<br />            hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki<br />    actually wanted</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Madan, now LOOK for a 20 year Old Agressive youth - performing<br />Dual<br />  role (!?) for ARUMOZHI and Rajendra !</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you asking for a contemporary actor?</p>
<p>Though I might disagree on the trend of movies he has been doing and though<br />he may not be 20, I would say Ajith would be a great fit... he has shown<br />that he can do negative and historical roles (asoka). He could also portray<br />a younger face, and he is a skilled actor <acronym title="In my humble opinion" IMHO</acronym  (In my humble opinion).</p>
<p>But for raja raja chola alone, I would suggest rajkiran - who is the only<br />one with the stature and Khambeeram to do it as of today.</p>
<p>On the lighter side, Dhanush could do adithya karikalan. He seems to have<br />the ill-luck of performing characters that dont suit his looks! ;)</p>
<p>Another question while on the topic... Prince Charles is 60+ today but he<br />still is not 'King'. Is it possible that that during scantily warring times<br />the kings had a long life and thier sons got to be King only at some ripe<br />age?</p>

<p>      THIS FATHER AND SON COMBINATION IS AN UNIQUE<br />    COMBINATION.<br />      (Dear Kamal @ adithakarikalan bear with me :: I<br />    personally believe<br />    it is<br />      SPS and RjC @ SSS and NOT Karuvarar / RRC - who<br />    assumed themselves<br />    as<br />      Sanathana Munivars under the (Lotus) Feet of Lord<br />    Siva - as depicted<br />    in<br />      the Big Temple!)</p>
<p>      Dear Madan, now LOOK for a 20 year Old Agressive<br />    youth - performing<br />    Dual<br />      role (!?) for ARUMOZHI and Rajendra !</p>
<p>      And Remember this Arumozhi is a Wrestler !<br />      And a very romantic guy even after became known<br />    RRC: Vows not to<br />    perform<br />      JALAKREEDA till he conquers MANYAKETAM (which he<br />    does in 1006 - 07 -<br />    by<br />      conquering Sathyashreyan !) ~</p>

<p>        Just thought I could summarize some of the unique features of <br />PS<br />  as<br />        compared to other historic novels written in Tamil -</p>
<p>        * Most of the novels have a big invasion or fighting between 2<br />        kingdoms as their climax. The entire novel will be moving <br />towards<br />        this event and the author would have supported one side -<br />      portraying<br />        the other as the evil force. Kalki's own SS is no exception to<br />      this.</p>
<p>        But PS is different in this respect - to a careful observer it<br />  will<br />        be evident that the novel does'nt have a climax on its own ! <br />Kalki<br />        felt that the renunciation of Crown by Arulmizhi was his <br />climax<br />        (refer his conclusion to the novel) - to many readers it is <br />the<br />        murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither or both. That is <br />why<br />      when<br />        you finish the novel, you always suffer from a sort of<br />        dissatisfaction - no other novel can give this feeling - that <br />too<br />      at<br />        the end of 5th volume !</p>
<p>        * Most of the novels have a King or a prince as its hero ? but<br />  in<br />        PS<br />        a small, insignificant and noble warrior (Vandhiyathevan) <br />becomes<br />  a<br />        hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki actually wanted<br />      Arulmozhi<br />        to be recognized as a hero in his novel ? the name Ponniyin<br />        selvan is<br />        derived from him ? but an `all perfect' figure he<br />        portrayed only<br />        helped to distance readers from Arulmizhi. Moreover the <br />chronology<br />      of<br />        events was also in favour of Vandhiyathevan. It is interesting <br />to<br />        compare Vandhiyathevan with Paranjothi ? who is a character in<br />  SS<br />        and<br />        Ponnan of Parthiban Kanavu. In SS Paranjothi character is used <br />to<br />        introduce many characters in the Novel ? but the real hero is<br />        Narasimhavarman. It is certain that Kalki wanted to adopt a<br />  similar<br />        technique but somehow Vandhiyathevan triumphed over his own<br />      creator !</p>
<p>        * Usually such long historic stories have to portray some <br />breaks<br />  in<br />        timeline (invariably). For example, in SS the last part <br />happens<br />      after<br />        a gap of 9 years. But PS portrays events continuously for a <br />period<br />      of<br />        6 months. If you trace back carefully, you can actually find <br />out<br />      who<br />        was doing what for almost every day ? for a period of 6<br />  months.</p>
<p>        * Probably its portrayal of simultaneous happenings in many <br />many<br />        places is unique to Tamil historic novel genere. At some point <br />of<br />        time, he will be detailing different events happening in <br />Srilanka,<br />        Tanjore, Pazhaiyarai, Kudanthai and Kadambur ? and yet ?<br />        with master<br />        craftsmanship ? will link them in a very logical order ?<br />  as<br />        pages<br />        move by?</p>
<p>        * Its characterization of people is a well discussed and well<br />        researched topic</p>
<p>        * This is probably the only novel in which we see almost all <br />kinds<br />      of<br />        love between human beings portrayed ?<br />        - Vandhiyathevan and Kundhavai who are in love with each other<br />      since<br />        their first sight.<br />        - Poonguzhali's love for Arulmozhi and her compromise to marry<br />        Amudhan<br />        - Arulmozhi's interest in Poonguzhali and his compromise to <br />marry<br />        vanathi<br />        - Vanathi's love towords Arulmizhi<br />        - Amudhan's love towords Poonguzhali<br />        - Nandhini's love towords Aditya and her revenge<br />        - Aditya's love towords Nandhini<br />        - Parthibendhran's love towords Nandhini<br />        - Pazhuvettaraiyar's interest in Nandhini<br />        - Manimekalai's love towords Vandhiyathevan</p>
<p>        Initially I thought of categorizing them (like one sided love, <br />two<br />        sided love etc) but I find that it is difficult to do ? given<br />  the<br />        wide spectrum of relationship kalki portrays</p>
<p>        * PS is perhaps the only novel in which the story is not <br />entirely<br />        dominated by Hero. Sometimes I think PS has different heros at<br />        different points of time?<br />        - In Pallipadai events (Part I) Azvarkadiyan sounds like a <br />hero<br />        - In Nilavarai and many other occations, ofcourse<br />        Vandhiyathevan dominates<br />        - In Part II Arulmozhi dominates in many occasions<br />        - Sendhan amudhan surprisingly dominates certain portains in<br />        Part IV and V (During Mandakini escape from Pallakku, when he<br />      becomes<br />        royal heir etc)<br />        - During the aftermath of floods (Part IV), Pazhuvettaraiyar<br />        certainly becomes a hero for a chapter or two<br />        Thus it is close to real life in which different people become<br />      heros<br />        at different points of time.</p>
<p>        * Surprise ! PS seems to have no villains ! (or rather <br />everybody<br />      seem<br />        to have enough justifications) Nandhini might sound like a <br />villi<br />      but<br />        after reading her childhood we understand that there are <br />enough<br />        reasons behind her abhorrence. Ravidasan ? Soman sambavan ?<br />      Remember<br />        ?<br />        they had vowed to give their life in case they fail to protect<br />      their<br />        leader. But instead they choose to live and take revenge. They<br />        undergo so many troubles to achieve their goal. Considering <br />the<br />        cruelty of Pandiya's murder ? this can be understood.<br />        In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with<br />      possible<br />        realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.</p>
<p>        I initially though of writing a small mail ? but this is close<br />  to<br />        becoming an article. I can write many things like this?.and<br />  yet<br />        may<br />        not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this <br />greatest<br />        historic novel ever written.</p>
<p>        Your comments are welcome.<br />        Cheers !<br />        Gokul.</p></madanus@></p></blockquote>

<p>      * This is probably the only novel in which we see almost all kinds<br />    of<br />      love between human beings portrayed ?<br />      - Vandhiyathevan and Kundhavai who are in love with each other<br />    since<br />      their first sight.<br />      - Poonguzhali's love for Arulmozhi and her compromise to marry<br />      Amudhan<br />      - Arulmozhi's interest in Poonguzhali and his compromise to marry<br />      vanathi<br />      - Vanathi's love towords Arulmizhi<br />      - Amudhan's love towords Poonguzhali<br />      - Nandhini's love towords Aditya and her revenge<br />      - Aditya's love towords Nandhini<br />      - Parthibendhran's love towords Nandhini<br />      - Pazhuvettaraiyar's interest in Nandhini<br />      - Manimekalai's love towords Vandhiyathevan</p>
<p>      Initially I thought of categorizing them (like one sided love, two<br />      sided love etc) but I find that it is difficult to do ? given<br />the<br />      wide spectrum of relationship kalki portrays</p>
<p>      * PS is perhaps the only novel in which the story is not entirely<br />      dominated by Hero. Sometimes I think PS has different heros at<br />      different points of time?<br />      - In Pallipadai events (Part I) Azvarkadiyan sounds like a hero<br />      - In Nilavarai and many other occations, ofcourse<br />      Vandhiyathevan dominates<br />      - In Part II Arulmozhi dominates in many occasions<br />      - Sendhan amudhan surprisingly dominates certain portains in<br />      Part IV and V (During Mandakini escape from Pallakku, when he<br />    becomes<br />      royal heir etc)<br />      - During the aftermath of floods (Part IV), Pazhuvettaraiyar<br />      certainly becomes a hero for a chapter or two<br />      Thus it is close to real life in which different people become<br />    heros<br />      at different points of time.</p>
<p>      * Surprise ! PS seems to have no villains ! (or rather everybody<br />    seem<br />      to have enough justifications) Nandhini might sound like a villi<br />    but<br />      after reading her childhood we understand that there are enough<br />      reasons behind her abhorrence. Ravidasan ? Soman sambavan ?<br />    Remember<br />      ?<br />      they had vowed to give their life in case they fail to protect<br />    their<br />      leader. But instead they choose to live and take revenge. They<br />      undergo so many troubles to achieve their goal. Considering the<br />      cruelty of Pandiya's murder ? this can be understood.<br />      In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with<br />    possible<br />      realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.</p>
<p>      I initially though of writing a small mail ? but this is close<br />to<br />      becoming an article. I can write many things like this?.and<br />yet<br />      may<br />      not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this greatest<br />      historic novel ever written.</p>

        <p>Maybe its just me... but having seen 'Raja raja cholan' - the movie, I could<br />only imagine Shivaji whenever the name arulmozhivarman was mentioned in the<br />book... which in fact doesnt match the illustrations done by maniam - in<br />which arulmozhivarman is always protrayed as a youthful character, of maybe<br />16-20 years - which in turn contradicts Kalki's own description of him as<br />powerful enough to bring down vvthevan down from a horse...</p>
<p>why am I ranting?</p>

<p>    Just thought I could summarize some of the unique features of PS as<br />    compared to other historic novels written in Tamil -</p>
<p>    * Most of the novels have a big invasion or fighting between 2<br />    kingdoms as their climax. The entire novel will be moving towards<br />    this event and the author would have supported one side -<br />  portraying<br />    the other as the evil force. Kalki's own SS is no exception to<br />  this.</p>
<p>    But PS is different in this respect - to a careful observer it will<br />    be evident that the novel does'nt have a climax on its own ! Kalki<br />    felt that the renunciation of Crown by Arulmizhi was his climax<br />    (refer his conclusion to the novel) - to many readers it is the<br />    murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither or both. That is why<br />  when<br />    you finish the novel, you always suffer from a sort of<br />    dissatisfaction - no other novel can give this feeling - that too<br />  at<br />    the end of 5th volume !</p>
<p>    * Most of the novels have a King or a prince as its hero ? but in<br />    PS<br />    a small, insignificant and noble warrior (Vandhiyathevan) becomes a<br />    hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki actually wanted<br />  Arulmozhi<br />    to be recognized as a hero in his novel ? the name Ponniyin<br />    selvan is<br />    derived from him ? but an `all perfect' figure he<br />    portrayed only<br />    helped to distance readers from Arulmizhi. Moreover the chronology<br />  of<br />    events was also in favour of Vandhiyathevan. It is interesting to<br />    compare Vandhiyathevan with Paranjothi ? who is a character in SS<br />    and<br />    Ponnan of Parthiban Kanavu. In SS Paranjothi character is used to<br />    introduce many characters in the Novel ? but the real hero is<br />    Narasimhavarman. It is certain that Kalki wanted to adopt a similar<br />    technique but somehow Vandhiyathevan triumphed over his own<br />  creator !</p>
<p>    * Usually such long historic stories have to portray some breaks in<br />    timeline (invariably). For example, in SS the last part happens<br />  after<br />    a gap of 9 years. But PS portrays events continuously for a period<br />  of<br />    6 months. If you trace back carefully, you can actually find out<br />  who<br />    was doing what for almost every day ? for a period of 6 months.</p>
<p>    * Probably its portrayal of simultaneous happenings in many many<br />    places is unique to Tamil historic novel genere. At some point of<br />    time, he will be detailing different events happening in Srilanka,<br />    Tanjore, Pazhaiyarai, Kudanthai and Kadambur ? and yet ?<br />    with master<br />    craftsmanship ? will link them in a very logical order ? as<br />    pages<br />    move by?</p>

          Arulmozhi Varman (Unique aspects of PS)        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>But, nobody can deny the beautiful way in which Arulmozhivarman, has <br />been portrayed.<br />Infact, his introduction scene, is just as pleasant as it could be.</p>
<p>He character later gains momentum, and reader expects him to be <br />there in current scene all the time.</p>
<p><acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym !</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "S.Gokul" <seshadrigokul@...  <br />wrote:</seshadrigokul@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  MESSAGE NO 201 FROM ARCHIVES REPOSTED:</p>
<p>  Just thought I could summarize some of the unique features of PS as<br />  compared to other historic novels written in Tamil -</p>
<p>  * Most of the novels have a big invasion or fighting between 2<br />  kingdoms as their climax. The entire novel will be moving towards<br />  this event and the author would have supported one side - <br />portraying<br />  the other as the evil force. Kalki's own SS is no exception to <br />this.</p>
<p>  But PS is different in this respect - to a careful observer it will<br />  be evident that the novel does'nt have a climax on its own ! Kalki<br />  felt that the renunciation of Crown by Arulmizhi was his climax<br />  (refer his conclusion to the novel) - to many readers it is the<br />  murder of Aditya - but to me it is neither or both. That is why <br />when<br />  you finish the novel, you always suffer from a sort of<br />  dissatisfaction - no other novel can give this feeling - that too <br />at<br />  the end of 5th volume !</p>
<p>  * Most of the novels have a King or a prince as its hero ? but in<br />  PS<br />  a small, insignificant and noble warrior (Vandhiyathevan) becomes a<br />  hero. It is interesting to note that Kalki actually wanted <br />Arulmozhi<br />  to be recognized as a hero in his novel ? the name Ponniyin<br />  selvan is<br />  derived from him ? but an `all perfect' figure he<br />  portrayed only<br />  helped to distance readers from Arulmizhi. Moreover the chronology <br />of<br />  events was also in favour of Vandhiyathevan. It is interesting to<br />  compare Vandhiyathevan with Paranjothi ? who is a character in SS<br />  and<br />  Ponnan of Parthiban Kanavu. In SS Paranjothi character is used to<br />  introduce many characters in the Novel ? but the real hero is<br />  Narasimhavarman. It is certain that Kalki wanted to adopt a similar<br />  technique but somehow Vandhiyathevan triumphed over his own <br />creator !</p>
<p>  * Usually such long historic stories have to portray some breaks in<br />  timeline (invariably). For example, in SS the last part happens <br />after<br />  a gap of 9 years. But PS portrays events continuously for a period <br />of<br />  6 months. If you trace back carefully, you can actually find out <br />who<br />  was doing what for almost every day ? for a period of 6 months.</p>
<p>  * Probably its portrayal of simultaneous happenings in many many<br />  places is unique to Tamil historic novel genere. At some point of<br />  time, he will be detailing different events happening in Srilanka,<br />  Tanjore, Pazhaiyarai, Kudanthai and Kadambur ? and yet ?<br />  with master<br />  craftsmanship ? will link them in a very logical order ? as<br />  pages<br />  move by?</p>
<p>  * Its characterization of people is a well discussed and well<br />  researched topic</p>
<p>  * This is probably the only novel in which we see almost all kinds <br />of<br />  love between human beings portrayed ?<br />  - Vandhiyathevan and Kundhavai who are in love with each other <br />since<br />  their first sight.<br />  - Poonguzhali's love for Arulmozhi and her compromise to marry<br />  Amudhan<br />  - Arulmozhi's interest in Poonguzhali and his compromise to marry<br />  vanathi<br />  - Vanathi's love towords Arulmizhi<br />  - Amudhan's love towords Poonguzhali<br />  - Nandhini's love towords Aditya and her revenge<br />  - Aditya's love towords Nandhini<br />  - Parthibendhran's love towords Nandhini<br />  - Pazhuvettaraiyar's interest in Nandhini<br />  - Manimekalai's love towords Vandhiyathevan</p>
<p>  Initially I thought of categorizing them (like one sided love, two<br />  sided love etc) but I find that it is difficult to do ? given the<br />  wide spectrum of relationship kalki portrays</p>
<p>  * PS is perhaps the only novel in which the story is not entirely<br />  dominated by Hero. Sometimes I think PS has different heros at<br />  different points of time?<br />  - In Pallipadai events (Part I) Azvarkadiyan sounds like a hero<br />  - In Nilavarai and many other occations, ofcourse<br />  Vandhiyathevan dominates<br />  - In Part II Arulmozhi dominates in many occasions<br />  - Sendhan amudhan surprisingly dominates certain portains in<br />  Part IV and V (During Mandakini escape from Pallakku, when he <br />becomes<br />  royal heir etc)<br />  - During the aftermath of floods (Part IV), Pazhuvettaraiyar<br />  certainly becomes a hero for a chapter or two<br />  Thus it is close to real life in which different people become <br />heros<br />  at different points of time.</p>
<p>  * Surprise ! PS seems to have no villains ! (or rather everybody <br />seem<br />  to have enough justifications) Nandhini might sound like a villi <br />but<br />  after reading her childhood we understand that there are enough<br />  reasons behind her abhorrence. Ravidasan ? Soman sambavan ? <br />Remember<br />  ?<br />  they had vowed to give their life in case they fail to protect <br />their<br />  leader. But instead they choose to live and take revenge. They<br />  undergo so many troubles to achieve their goal. Considering the<br />  cruelty of Pandiya's murder ? this can be understood.<br />  In other words, the negative forces are also portrayed with <br />possible<br />  realism a writer can bestow upon his characters.</p>
<p>  I initially though of writing a small mail ? but this is close to<br />  becoming an article. I can write many things like this?.and yet<br />  may<br />  not able to fully portray the heights and depths of this greatest<br />  historic novel ever written.</p>
<p>  Your comments are welcome.<br />  Cheers !<br />  Gokul.</p>
