        <p>Exactly! Arun has the hit the nail! Peace makes a major difference in <br />lives. To me any era that's been really peaceful with a lot of free <br />time at the hands of the able bodied people and as a result, arts <br />flourished. Such is a time that can be called a time of peace. Those <br />are glorious days for any civilization or dynasty or whatever we call <br />it. </p>
<p>As Madan rightly asked, given a choice of living between Afghanistan <br />and India, where would you want to be? Let's put two foreign places <br />which many of us may not know much. Between Afghanistan and China, <br />where would you want to be? We would still prefer China or for that <br />matter even the cold Siberian Russia to Afghanistan. The reason <br />PEACE! The present is any day peaceful times to live than the past. </p>
<p>Also, the reason, I brought in Timeline was to show this contrast and <br />not diseases. Guess that sent another track of thought to MEDICINE. <br />With all due respect to then golden era of the Chozhas, I would <br />prefer to have it as my history and roots and read about the lovely <br />times in the present day living room where I enjoy reading my books <br />drinking a cup of tea and live very much in the present and do the <br />kind of discussions that I am doing right now. (he he he -- selfish <br />me)</p>
<p>Madan do not lose heart. The kings you love are the kings we love <br />too. And that's the reason we are all here together in this group. If <br />I am to live during the 13th century and am given a choice of where I <br />want to live, I would want to live in any one or all the four of our <br />four nadus, the Thondai, Chozha, Pandiya or Chera. That was the best <br />place on earth to live then for the way and standard of lives of the <br />common man were. As Deepa said, its the life of the common man that <br />we do not have in detail. </p>
<p>And yes Sridhar thank you, it was Andre Marek. I saw the movie for <br />first time this weekend. Only when I mentioned about the book it in <br />that mail, did I realize that I had missed seeing the movie after <br />reading the book. The movie was really good. (Successfully made my <br />husband watch it?what an achievement) They had done justice to the <br />book. You do feel transported to the 100 years war that the book <br />talks about. Also, as you said, if you get a Lady Claire, then its <br />cool to live in that war mongering pestilence ridden past or may be <br />in my case, get a Vandhiyathevan or an Arul Mozhi Varmar, if not its <br />not worth it -- but even with that, I some how personally feel its <br />not worth when you have the choice of living in the present. </p>
<blockquote><p>  but can we live in that SILENCE.....Srividya<br />  will know what I am talking about</p></blockquote>
<p>--But then, Sridhar, what is the SILENCE that you were talking about? <br />I am not sure if I understand that right.. Are you talking about all <br />our discussions that we are having right now and the SILENCE or the <br />lack of it that may happen if we were to live in the past? Is that <br />what you mean as to if we can live with that? if that's the case, did <br />we not have a lot of Clubs (am unable to get the right tamil word for <br />it) those days? Oh yeah! AVAIGAL and KAVI ARANGUGAL where they had a <br />lot of literary discussions.-- Am I right? Do you not think that we <br />could have survived with those?</p>
<p>Present is my choice any day with all these lovely books that can <br />transport me to the past in between those pages. That's my wholesome <br />choice. :)</p>
<p>Sorry guys too long a mail. Got carried away! :)</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Vidya. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Madan,</p>
<p>  The point is that there never was any long term security. Even the <br />Chozhas<br />  in their time lost wars. THe problem is that if a kingdom is always <br />on the<br />  go (war oriented), then the populace has to suffer from more taxes <br />etc. Not<br />  really the ideal place to be. I suspect that the reason some of the <br />oldies<br />  wax eloquent about the British rule is that, yes, after all the <br />turmoil of<br />  petty chieftains over the past centuries, there was a measure of <br />relative<br />  calm and safety for the common man.</p>

<p>            I enjoy being transported when reading the<br />      book in<br />            my imagination,<br />            but in reality, I would very much prefer to be<br />            buried in the cozy<br />            furniture of my room when I look out of the<br />      book.<br />            The present is very<br />            much the place where I want to br grounded for<br />      live<br />            with some short<br />            imaginary visits to exotic places like our<br />      12th<br />            century choza nadu<br />            that is made possible by writers like kalki.</p>

        <p>Madan,</p>
<p>The point is that there never was any long term security. Even the Chozhas<br />in their time lost wars. THe problem is that if a kingdom is always on the<br />go (war oriented), then the populace has to suffer from more taxes etc. Not<br />really the ideal place to be. I suspect that the reason some of the oldies<br />wax eloquent about the British rule is that, yes, after all the turmoil of<br />petty chieftains over the past centuries, there was a measure of relative<br />calm and safety for the common man.</p>

<p>Current era or every era in the human history has been peaceful for some and always a struggle for some. Those who are fortunate enough would claim glory days and those on the other side will claim otherwise. Even in US everybody is not living the so called american dream. </p>

<p>        I enjoy being transported when reading the<br />  book in<br />        my imagination,<br />        but in reality, I would very much prefer to be<br />        buried in the cozy<br />        furniture of my room when I look out of the<br />  book.<br />        The present is very<br />        much the place where I want to br grounded for<br />  live<br />        with some short<br />        imaginary visits to exotic places like our<br />  12th<br />        century choza nadu<br />        that is made possible by writers like kalki.</p>
<p>        If any of you have read Timeline by Michael<br />  Crichton<br />        you may be able<br />        to relate how one of the characters of the<br />  novel--I<br />        do not remember<br />        his name--likes the middle ages and remains<br />  there in<br />        their sojurn<br />        that they take to have a real life experience<br />  of<br />        France during the<br />        middle ages.</p>
<p>        Looks like some of you want to do that--for<br />  those<br />        who want to and<br />        havent read Timeline, try reading that first<br />  (am<br />        sure you will have<br />        real fun)--While others are happy with the<br />  imaginary<br />        visits that they<br />        get like me :)</p>

<p>      I enjoy being transported when reading the book in<br />      my imagination,<br />      but in reality, I would very much prefer to be<br />      buried in the cozy<br />      furniture of my room when I look out of the book.<br />      The present is very<br />      much the place where I want to br grounded for live<br />      with some short<br />      imaginary visits to exotic places like our 12th<br />      century choza nadu<br />      that is made possible by writers like kalki.</p>
<p>      If any of you have read Timeline by Michael Crichton<br />      you may be able<br />      to relate how one of the characters of the novel--I<br />      do not remember<br />      his name--likes the middle ages and remains there in<br />      their sojurn<br />      that they take to have a real life experience of<br />      France during the<br />      middle ages.</p>
<p>      Looks like some of you want to do that--for those<br />      who want to and<br />      havent read Timeline, try reading that first (am<br />      sure you will have<br />      real fun)--While others are happy with the imaginary<br />      visits that they<br />      get like me :)</p>

        <p>Hi Arun,<br />Your mail has an interesting line of thought. I would<br />however like to add a few of my own here. War and<br />Peace co-exisist in the world. We may be at peace in a<br />community, an area where we reside, at work but one<br />can never be too sure when something bad is going to<br />happen. </p>
<p>Bad: Not really just natural calamities but problems<br />caused by man-kind. I have been travelling to Mysore<br />from Bangalore for 8 years now for my academic<br />endevors, some years ago we just hopped on to the<br />Shatabdi express and landed in Mysore. Now in either<br />station there are sniffer dogs and anxious cops trying<br />to look for possible bombs....this is far from being<br />peaceful. There are many instances, I am quoting just<br />one here.</p>
<p>War: According to my Boss, war is one of the major<br />reasons for Technical advancement. Margerine in lieu<br />of butter, canned foods etc.</p>
<p>The good exisists with the bad in this world. Looting<br />and the rest may not happen openly today. But it's not<br />that bad things have ceased to happen.</p>
<p>:)As my Patti used to say, her 2 hours of sincere<br />prayer is to request God to minimize the sufferings<br />and to give us the strength to brave the trials and<br />tribulations of life.</p>
<p>Sorry for having rambled on like this....but hey!! it<br />was FUN</p>

<p>      If any of you have read Timeline by Michael<br />  Crichton<br />      you may be able<br />      to relate how one of the characters of the<br />  novel--I<br />      do not remember<br />      his name--likes the middle ages and remains<br />  there in<br />      their sojurn<br />      that they take to have a real life experience of<br />      France during the<br />      middle ages.</p>
<p>      Looks like some of you want to do that--for<br />  those<br />      who want to and<br />      havent read Timeline, try reading that first (am<br />      sure you will have<br />      real fun)--While others are happy with the<br />  imaginary<br />      visits that they<br />      get like me :)</p>
<p>      thanks,<br />      Vidya.</p>

        <p>Ok i must confess to being the heretic here then. I still believe that our<br />Age is the most peaceful. Wars were a fact of life during those times... We<br />read all these romanticized novels.. and assume people were all healthy,<br />wealthy and wise! Come on... wars imply lots of problems for the common<br />folks. Gangs of marauding murderers bent on mayhem rape, loot. Now don't<br />tell me our glorious tamizh brethren didn't go in for that sort of a thing.<br />Human character hasn't changed all that much. Taking a look at some of the<br />rather unsavory characters infesting our political landscape, what makes one<br />believe that things were any different back then? Assuming that Raja Raja<br />Chozhan was a saint, that doesnt imply that the coterie around him would<br />have been any different from the political hangers on these days. Yes, there<br />would have been some great guys.. but there would also have been enough<br />lumpen elements. All in all, I do believe the current era we live in is the<br />most peaceful.</p>

<p>  Looks like some of you want to do that--for those<br />  who want to and <br />  havent read Timeline, try reading that first (am<br />  sure you will have <br />  real fun)--While others are happy with the imaginary<br />  visits that they <br />  get like me :)</p>
<p>  thanks,<br />  Vidya. </p>

        <p>Dear Srividya <br />interesting you should mention timeline...I have just read its a good read<br />the Charector you are talking about is Andre Marek....</p>
<p>I m sure it would be fun to go back in time as lomng as you settle with Poonguzhali or Nandhini like Andre...</p>
<p>Coming to the life in those times..we are basing most of our idea of yesteryears based on the recent history written by the British when we have been victims of newer diseases brought by the european travellers...</p>
<p>The Aztecs did not loose to cortez they lost to smallpox</p>
<p>Our ancients had a very good medical and surgical system so I dont think life would have been that bad...</p>
<p>but can we live in that SILENCE.....Srividya will know what I am talking about</p>

<p>  your mails have really become fun to read and it<br />  is becoming infectious. <br />  to be specific your use of phrases like "rocks big<br />  time", "cool dude", i think<br />  would have been used for the first time in this<br />  mailing list.</p>

<p>  But life's like that....impressions created in a<br />  positive way makes us love the person we are<br />  reading/hearing about even without knowing that<br />  person.</p>
<p>  Ideal example in all our lives....we all as children<br />  (pre-school age) would have not met our entire<br />  family<br />  but an older person at home (A patti, thatha or amma<br />  and appa) would talk with love and positivity about<br />  som e relative and viola when the kid meets that<br />  person, there is immediate happiness and<br />  connectivity.</p>
<p>  Kalki rocks big time. He has penned a lovely book<br />  making us love RRC and his people and also Kalki has<br />  brought this group of complete strangers together in<br />  a<br />  happy harmonious discussion of his book and other<br />  things.</p>

<p>    your mails have really become fun to read and it<br />  is becoming <br />  infectious. <br />    to be specific your use of phrases like "rocks<br />  big time", "cool <br />  dude", i think<br />    would have been used for the first time in this<br />  mailing list.</p>

<p>    Ideal example in all our lives....we all as<br />  children<br />    (pre-school age) would have not met our entire<br />  family<br />    but an older person at home (A patti, thatha or<br />  amma<br />    and appa) would talk with love and positivity<br />  about<br />    som e relative and viola when the kid meets that<br />    person, there is immediate happiness and<br />  connectivity.</p>
<p>    Kalki rocks big time. He has penned a lovely book<br />    making us love RRC and his people and also Kalki<br />  has<br />    brought this group of complete strangers together<br />  in a<br />    happy harmonious discussion of his book and other<br />    things.</p>

<p>    Worst of all would be the fact if I could actually<br />  see our favourite<br />  prince<br />    - it would destroy the illusion of Ponniyin<br />  Selvan. He might turn<br />  out to be<br />    a perfectly normal guy (gods!), or I might see him<br />  parading about<br />  with 15<br />    wives. The fact remains that he was a hard-headed<br />  ruler with all the<br />  tricks<br />    of raja thanthiram up his sleeve. :)</p>
<p>    That's why Kalki is such a freaking genius.<br />  Instead of taking up the<br />  adult<br />    Raja Raja Chozhan and idolizing him, he chose the<br />  young,<br />  impressionable and<br />    still idealistic Arulmozhi Varman for his hero.</p>

        <p>Ha ha....this would be fun.</p>
<p>But life's like that....impressions created in a<br />positive way makes us love the person we are<br />reading/hearing about even without knowing that<br />person.</p>
<p>Ideal example in all our lives....we all as children<br />(pre-school age) would have not met our entire family<br />but an older person at home (A patti, thatha or amma<br />and appa) would talk with love and positivity about<br />som e relative and viola when the kid meets that<br />person, there is immediate happiness and connectivity.</p>
<p>Kalki rocks big time. He has penned a lovely book<br />making us love <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and his people and also Kalki has<br />brought this group of complete strangers together in a<br />happy harmonious discussion of his book and other<br />things.</acronym></p>
<p>Lovely don't you think?</p>
<p>I don't even know who are the people I communicate<br />with, or what they do:) But it feels like "Family <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym "<br />now.</acronym></p>

        <p>Hi Madan,<br />Your thoughts are most interesting. We are all so<br />facinated by the royality that often we forget the<br />common man. In Parthiban Kanavu, the commoner<br />(Boatman) Ponna and his wife did seem to live a<br />comfortable life, food to eat, a home to live<br />in.............</p>
<p>My friend is the niece of the Mysore maharaja. Her<br />Mom, was telling me, that in the yesteryears....food<br />was distributed free from the kovils. So no person<br />goes hungry. I wouldn't be a feast but a basic<br />pullisadam thirsadam to keep body and soul together.</p>
<p>The food the royalty ate was AWSOME. My friend still<br />cooks the old mysore dishes at home.....drooling just<br />thinking of the lovely colors and flavors which are<br />prescribed to suit the eater in harmony with the<br />climate and stress:)</p>
<p>Best Wishes,<br />Deeps<br />--- Madan U Sreenivasan <madanus@gmail.com  wrote:</p></madanus@gmail.com></p>
<blockquote><p>  your observation maybe correct (am saying 'maybe'<br />  because we have no idea of<br />  the exact lifestyle of commoners of those times),<br />  Arun, and I doubt thats<br />  exactly what people thousand years from now would<br />  say about us.</p>
<p>  Am anyways a city guy, and cities are generally the<br />  last to be touched by<br />  such problems (especially the capital cities). If<br />  you doubt my words, please<br />  travel a 100 kms on kanakpura road from Bangalore.<br />  Within 20-30kms, the dust<br />  of the city would settle and you would get dusty mud<br />  roads and smaller<br />  houses - not quite what one would expect just 20-30<br />  kms away.</p>
<p>  So, in most probability, I would have settled in<br />  Thanjavur or pazhaiarai (as<br />  a spy? ;)</p>
<p>  Anyways, am not only talking of the glory of our<br />  kings and cities, but also<br />  the much healthier lifestyle - much closer to<br />  nature. Life was tougher no<br />  doubt, but much healthier too. ( I do know the<br />  statistics about how<br />  life-spans have increased from the time of<br />  independence, but I also think<br />  lifespan is such a difficult thing nowadays, because<br />  of the unhealthy,<br />  unnatural lifestyle we are leading.)</p>
<p>  Why am I so passionate? Well, you should visit the<br />  marundheeswarar temple in<br />  thiruvanmaiyoor... where they have tried to preserve<br />  the old carvings as is,<br />  they also have modern amenities like electric bulbs<br />  and varnish painted<br />  stones. Every time I go there, there is some concert<br />  happening (with at<br />  least a 100 people listening), in front of the<br />  thiagaraya sannidhi - which<br />  stands testimony to the blending of the old with new<br />  and brings the whole<br />  place back to life.</p>
<p>  But the 'pullarichifying' feeling an old stone with<br />  intricate carvings gives<br />  me is not matched when I see the unartfully lit<br />  praharams. Just shows how<br />  much less care we are taking in the maintainance. <br />  Am sure we could light<br />  up our temples much more aesthetically, than just a<br />  dozen tubelights running<br />  the length of the praharams. Same is the case with<br />  the lack of attention to<br />  where the speakers are placed for the concert. We<br />  have more power, and more<br />  speakers, so fit them wherever... not really<br />  acoustic.</p>
<p>  Thats where I feel the lack of impressiveness in<br />  today's work. We are all<br />  running around chasing the evasive happiness, which<br />  we could get just if we<br />  live in the now and here and do the work we are<br />  doing with full dedication.<br />  I find this generally missing in today's work<br />  environment.</p>
<p>  Sorrry about the rant... just what my heart yearns<br />  to do.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Madan.</p>

<p>    hmmmmm I doubt if I would want to live in those<br />  times. Wars all<br />    around... the kings and chieftains mobilizing all<br />  the time... pestilence,<br />    famine (inevitable effects of war). I think if we<br />  take off our rose tinted<br />    glasses, the current day and age is much better<br />  than the chola times :)</p>

        <p>I enjoy being transported when reading the book in my imagination, <br />but in reality, I would very much prefer to be buried in the cozy <br />furniture of my room when I look out of the book. The present is very <br />much the place where I want to br grounded for live with some short <br />imaginary visits to exotic places like our 12th century choza nadu <br />that is made possible by writers like kalki. </p>
<p>If any of you have read Timeline by Michael Crichton you may be able <br />to relate how one of the characters of the novel--I do not remember <br />his name--likes the middle ages and remains there in their sojurn <br />that they take to have a real life experience of France during the <br />middle ages. </p>
<p>Looks like some of you want to do that--for those who want to and <br />havent read Timeline, try reading that first (am sure you will have <br />real fun)--While others are happy with the imaginary visits that they <br />get like me :)</p>
<p>thanks,<br />Vidya. </p>

<p>  Hi<br />  its easy to imagine being kunthavai's tholi or kunthavai herself.  <br />or <br />  for the matter vanthiyathevan or a courtier in the chola court.</p>
<p>  but try imagining yourself as a slave slogging on a piece of stone <br />to <br />  finish it up as a pillar. </p>
<p>  most of the men had no guarentee for their next meal leave alone <br />  their lives.</p>

<p>Well said Madan. As the saying goes 'Old is gold'...There are ifs <br />and buts and when there was not a problem. Our friend said, olden <br />days people were always afraid of Wars..as if we are living total <br />peace.. endha edathual bomb vedikkum, yaru nallavan yaru <br />kettavan.....these things keeps the mind busy. </p>
<p>Can we trust anyone these days? I am not pondering on all the <br />intricate details you people talk about....am a normal <br />person...thinking normally....forget 1000 years...we have witnessed <br />the change in just two decades....</p>
<p>Even 10 years back, if someone on the road knocks at the door and <br />asks for water, everyone will give 'sombu' full of water... can we <br />get a drop of drinking water today by knocking at any door? 'asku <br />busku...naanga kasu koduthu vangarom. venumna kadaila poi vangikka' -<br />this will be the reply. Only for the past 10-12 years, we are <br />travelling with water bottles, earlier, we never bother to drink <br />water whereever available, railway stations, bus stops <br />anywhere....can we do that now?</p>
<p>My personal definition of freedom and peace is - a person should be <br />able to live happily without any artificial dependencies, and should <br />lead a natural life. Is this possible today?</p>
<p>Leave alone 1000 yeas back..even 50-60 years back, a person can <br />leave his home to travel, without worrying about anything, can get <br />food, water, shelter whereever he goes and can be happy with <br />whatever is available. If such is the case half a century back, how <br />it would have been 1000 years back....shouldnt we say 'GLORIOUS' :)</p>

        <p>your observation maybe correct (am saying 'maybe' because we have no idea of<br />the exact lifestyle of commoners of those times), Arun, and I doubt thats<br />exactly what people thousand years from now would say about us.</p>
<p>Am anyways a city guy, and cities are generally the last to be touched by<br />such problems (especially the capital cities). If you doubt my words, please<br />travel a 100 kms on kanakpura road from Bangalore. Within 20-30kms, the dust<br />of the city would settle and you would get dusty mud roads and smaller<br />houses - not quite what one would expect just 20-30 kms away.</p>
<p>So, in most probability, I would have settled in Thanjavur or pazhaiarai (as<br />a spy? ;)</p>
<p>Anyways, am not only talking of the glory of our kings and cities, but also<br />the much healthier lifestyle - much closer to nature. Life was tougher no<br />doubt, but much healthier too. ( I do know the statistics about how<br />life-spans have increased from the time of independence, but I also think<br />lifespan is such a difficult thing nowadays, because of the unhealthy,<br />unnatural lifestyle we are leading.)</p>
<p>Why am I so passionate? Well, you should visit the marundheeswarar temple in<br />thiruvanmaiyoor... where they have tried to preserve the old carvings as is,<br />they also have modern amenities like electric bulbs and varnish painted<br />stones. Every time I go there, there is some concert happening (with at<br />least a 100 people listening), in front of the thiagaraya sannidhi - which<br />stands testimony to the blending of the old with new and brings the whole<br />place back to life.</p>
<p>But the 'pullarichifying' feeling an old stone with intricate carvings gives<br />me is not matched when I see the unartfully lit praharams. Just shows how<br />much less care we are taking in the maintainance. Am sure we could light<br />up our temples much more aesthetically, than just a dozen tubelights running<br />the length of the praharams. Same is the case with the lack of attention to<br />where the speakers are placed for the concert. We have more power, and more<br />speakers, so fit them wherever... not really acoustic.</p>
<p>Thats where I feel the lack of impressiveness in today's work. We are all<br />running around chasing the evasive happiness, which we could get just if we<br />live in the now and here and do the work we are doing with full dedication.<br />I find this generally missing in today's work environment.</p>
<p>Sorrry about the rant... just what my heart yearns to do.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>

        <p>hmmmmm I doubt if I would want to live in those times. Wars all around...<br />the kings and chieftains mobilizing all the time... pestilence, famine<br />(inevitable effects of war). I think if we take off our rose tinted glasses,<br />the current day and age is much better than the chola times :)</p>
