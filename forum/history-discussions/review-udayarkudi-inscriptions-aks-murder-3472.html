</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Friends,  </p>
<p>Pls recall details of the Udayarkudi incriptions posted in the Photo <br />Section (due to paucity of storing space in the Files Section.)</p>
<p>A Retd Dy Suptt of Police (DSP)Sri RAMARAJ from <acronym title="Central Bureau of Investigation" CBI</acronym , who was in the <br />team that investigated Late PM Rajiv Gandhi's murder, has been <br />concentrating on Aditha Karikalan's murder for the past 3 - 4 years. <br />Now settled in Chennai, he has contacted Dr. Kalaikkovan (who did <br />mention this when I spoke last week) &amp; Dr. Kudavoil. He had gone <br />through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions and opined. He has <br />been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we met and spent some <br />time on this subject.</acronym></p>
<p>FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review this subject from the <br />angle of investigating agency which has specialised in Poltical <br />assassinations. Secondly such person has already invested 3 -4 <br />years of hard work in going into several inscriptions, write ups, <br />books and other sources apart from personal interviews with <br />acknowledged Scholars on this subject.</p>
<p>With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the Udayarkudi <br />inscriptions and certain details evolved :</p>
<p>1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji's murder &amp; AK's murder.<br />2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD.  <br />Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both / other reasons..?  <br />How : ?? <br />WHO :: ??<br />3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light on the above .. <br />reviewed..<br />4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..</p>
<p>Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the insctiptions a decade <br />back, personally I have been maintaining that UTHAMA has a hand in <br />the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has been disturbing me.</p>
<p>This gentleman made me to look at this from another angle::</p>
<p>The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja's SAFETY till he <br />ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the mechanism to wipe of <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He could not be Drohin.</p>
<p>Kudavoil has been maintaining that the CONFISCATION OF LANDS took <br />place during Uthama's tenure.. </p>
<p>If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes under cloud.. </p>
<p>Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under Sundara or Uthama? <br />Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule in Pandya Kingdom?</p>
<p>But when certain matters were subjected under scrutiny, the opinion <br />is still swinging ..</p>
<p>It was an interesting experience to talk to him. I have agreed to <br />provide certain materials for his expert review.  </p>
<p>Will report more in due course. sps</p></acronym></p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "R.venketesh" <br /><abhivencat@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hi Poornima Sai </p>
<p>  Nandini is fiction. mathuranthakan is not. in actuality <br />  mathuranthakan became uthama. but kalki was a great fan of <br />alexander <br />  dumas I guess and like him has a emperor growing up amongst the <br />common <br />  man.</p>
<p>  so he created a charecter called senthan amuthan who becomes <br />uthama <br />  sola.<br />  amutha and uthama are anagrams.</p>
<p>  mandakini is fiction too. but most people do not realise that one <br />  ordinary charecter in the novel is responsible for may twists in <br />the <br />  story</p>
<p>  he is karuthiman alias kariya thirumal.</p>
<p>  he saves mandakini from drowning, he saves uthama from beiung <br />buried <br />  alive as a baby, he reveals to sendan his secret of his birth. he <br />  brings back mathuranthakan to the pandyas and so on.</p>
<p>  the genius of kalki was that he could give so much importance to <br />such <br />  an ordinary charecter.</p>
<p>  pungkuzhali is also a wonderful piece of fiction. the name of the <br />  goddess in a very ancient temple adjacent to kalki's village is <br />called <br />  vandamar punkuzhali.<br />  perhaps he chose that name because of this.</p>
<p>  regards<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>==================</p></blockquote>
<p>That is very interesting. Thank youy very much,</p>
<p>Study on Uthama is also appears to be more interesting.</p>
<p>To start with ::</p>
<p>Vikrama Chozha is the son of Sembiyan madevi ( Senthanamudan being <br />fictitious).</p>
<p>@ Vikrama Chozha was the names / titles assumed by Rajendra Chozha <br />s/o <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .</p>
<p>Did Rajendra recognise Uthama as Uthama OR </p>
<p>Did Rajendra want HIM to be remembered as UTHAMA in place of S/o <br />Sembiyanmadevi ?!   </p>

<p>Aditha Karikalan murder is undoubtedly a contraversial topic - that is <br />why even today it is discussed in length.</p>
<p>There have been several school of thoughts :</p>
<p>1. <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastry suspected Uthama's hand in the Cholas; 2. Sadasiva Pandrathar did not. (Incidentally he hails from <br />Tiruperumbuyam ! - recall <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym )<br />3. Kudanthai Sethuraman has discussed in length in his book "Early <br />Cholas" AK's murder in the Chapter "The Judgement" and absolved; 4. Contemporary Historians of repute like Dr. Kalaikkovan has agreed <br />to take up these inscriptions for study. Please find time to go into <br />the details of the Articles written by Dr. Kalaikkovan and Dr. Nalini <br />in <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a> to know of UNADULTERED TRUE History.<br />5. Dr. Kudavoil Balasubramanian of Saraswathi Mahal has taken up study <br />and put a paper "Udayarkudi Kalvettukkal" - Oru Meell Paarvai - which <br />I put in the Photo Section - which is the base paper for discussion.<br />6. Apart from them, Dr. Nagaswamy - Who was Director of Tamilnadu <br />State Archeology during MGR's period - is considered to be the <br />Authority (<a href="http://www.tamilarts" title="www.tamilarts">www.tamilarts</a> academy.com - I think) in <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  because of him <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Big temple details are brought out so gloriously in the past <br />25 years.<br />7. Vikaraman - who wrote sequel to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  - as Nandhi Purathu Nayaki and <br />Vandhiyathevan Vaall - was introduced to our Group by respected Member <br />Seethalakshmi Madam. <br />8. Magic Lantern - the Group which enacted Ponniyinselvan drama - is <br />introduced to our Group (Dr. Kalaikovan's siters son Elango Directed)- <br />by respected member Seethalakshmi Madam.<br />9. Apart from the above, our Group is directly interacting with <br />Archelogical Survey of India - Chennai / Thanjai / Kerala and has <br />access to Tamilnadu Archelogy Department also; 10. Our Group has been interacting (pls refer Musiri mail also) with <br />living Legends like Dr. Subbarayalu of Thanjai Tamil University. Dr. <br />Thiagarajan of Ariyalur Arts College History Deptt HOD (Who found <br />evidence of Dyno in Aryalur - between Chidambaram / Trichy) Dr. Akila <br />and our Group interacted with Great Personalities like Airavatham Dr. <br />mahadevan on Tamil Brahmi. Recently Dr. Dasarathan (Libis ) Media <br />Person TKV Rajan attended the meets of our Group.<br />11. Fiction Writers like Mr. Balakumaran (Udayar / Kadigai) has also <br />been consulted by our Group.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>All these details - records of discussions / visits etc., are there in <br />the Archieves of our Group.</p>
<p>Outright, the entire echoleon stated above, has rejected the postulate <br />involving <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  with AKs murder.</p>
<p>The DSP / <acronym title="Central Bureau of Investigation" CBI</acronym  (Retd) has definitely visited most of the Schools of <br />thoughts and is agreeable to discuss in our Group his methodologies.</acronym></p>
<p>Re Micro discussions, we can split everything into various TOPICs - <br />Search what is already reported from our Archieves and add whatever <br />is our opinion when need be.</p>
<p>We can also organise a Seminar with this TOPIC as a point of interest.</p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Wow...a gush of mail flows after a long time in this group. And <br />great to see that many new people have joined the discussion. <br />Welcome to all first timers :) and welcome to one of the long lost <br />face in the group welcome swetha...<br />I was not able to follow even the thread of mails due to work and <br />though compelled to write, did not find time.<br />Kundavai and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  conspiring against AK...quite possible. I think <br />almost all postultes have been discussed before, but every one <br />questions the 16 year wait of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . <br />Let me try to explain that..All would accept that though it was <br />Monarchy, earlier kings had a semi democracy as well. the king <br />makers or the sitrarasars, the traders community etc. should support<br />whoever ascends the throne. Sabayom, oorom etc. Sundara chola was <br />very much alive when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was murdered. Since he would have felt that <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was too young to ascend throne, he would have given it to <br />Uthama, who in actual is the legal hier. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  who would have thought <br />that if not <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym he should have been the king, shocked and unable to <br />go against his father, kept quite. sundara's supporters who were <br />loyal to him, supported Uthama. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  who already cleared off AK, <br />would have been a threat to Uthama and hence uthamas period of 16 <br />years didnt see any major uproars in terms of wars or any great <br />things. Though outwardly it seemed peaceful, Uthama would have lived <br />in constant fear of his life. 16 years is more than enough to gather <br />support by hook or crook, which <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  accomplished. Then continuing <br />the threat, he asked Uthama to quit and ascended the throne. Later <br />thinking that Uthamas son can be a threat to him or his son, he <br />cleared him off too. <br />Tiruvalangadu Cheppedu, which says <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  sacrificed the throne, <br />hehe..sonia gandhi is also claimed to have sacrificed the throne, <br />but in actual she announced that MMS will be PM after a 40 min <br />discussion with the president. In just 40 mins if a person can <br />become a tyaga chemmal, 16 years is more than enough to say anything.<br />SPS argument of a such a ruthless <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  constructing big temple...why <br />not? Ashoka killed 8(?) of his brothers to ascend the throne. He was <br />ruthless but changed overnight and spearheaded the spread of <br />Buddhism in India and abroad. nathigam pesinavangale manja thuni <br />potutanga..appuram enna sir...<br />Anyway, all are hypothesis and no one can prove anyone right or <br />wrong. Good discussion. edho ennala mudinchadhu. en pangukku koncham <br />olarittu poren.<br />Regards,<br />Satish</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Arun<br />nice thread nice logic ...<br />Ravidasan et al were punished by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and it is found in the Udayarudi Inscriptions<br />Having not read the inscriptions myself but it is referenced in so many places So Ravidasan was not part of Kalkis imagination</acronym></p>
<p>So it is based on inscriptional evidence and we have discussed about the punishment taht was meted as well he did not kill them but excommunicated them and send them out of the country...</p>
<p>I know G will have some answers but is keeping mum because that would be a crux of his Seramaan Kottai</p>
<p>Regards<br />Sri</p>
<p>Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@gmail.com  wrote:<br />Dear All,</drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>Lets revisit the facts again. Why do people believe it was Uthama?</p>
<p>the facts as we know them. If I have missed some please correct me:</p>
<p>a) Aditya Karikalan kills Pandiyan king and displays his severed head at fort wall <br />b) Aditya Karikalan gets murdered. <br />c) Uthama gets the throne after Sundara Chozhar<br />d) <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  gets the throne after Uthama and not Uthama's son<br />e) After <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  attains throne, Ravidasan and co (referred to as Drohin) are banished from Chozha Nadu </p>
<p>With just these facts in hand, I find it very difficult to pin blame one way or the other. Circumstantial evidence might enable us to say, as Kalki did that Uthama might have been involved and hence was deposed. The other idea could be the Pandiyan angle. Although again, displaying severed heads of enemy kings at the fort was something that was done fairly regularly in those days. I belive that the evidence is rather flimsy either which way. Were Ravidasan and co ever mentioned in connection with the murder of <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym in the kalvettu? Or only as Drohins? If only as Drohins, that might have been for just revealing secrets of state to the enemy. Remember that we associate Ravidasan and Co with AK's murder purely based on Kalki's book I think. (If I am mistaken and there indeed is some mention of Ravidasan and co in connection with AK's murder in some kalvettu, please correct me). </p>

<p>Nandini is fiction. mathuranthakan is not. in actuality <br />mathuranthakan became uthama. but kalki was a great fan of alexander <br />dumas I guess and like him has a emperor growing up amongst the common <br />man.</p>
<p>so he created a charecter called senthan amuthan who becomes uthama <br />sola.<br />amutha and uthama are anagrams.</p>
<p>mandakini is fiction too. but most people do not realise that one <br />ordinary charecter in the novel is responsible for may twists in the <br />story</p>
<p>he is karuthiman alias kariya thirumal.</p>
<p>he saves mandakini from drowning, he saves uthama from beiung buried <br />alive as a baby, he reveals to sendan his secret of his birth. he <br />brings back mathuranthakan to the pandyas and so on.</p>
<p>the genius of kalki was that he could give so much importance to such <br />an ordinary charecter.</p>
<p>pungkuzhali is also a wonderful piece of fiction. the name of the <br />goddess in a very ancient temple adjacent to kalki's village is called <br />vandamar punkuzhali.<br />perhaps he chose that name because of this.</p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Poornima,<br />Kalki was genius. no doubt about that.<br />but he was also handicapped by the fact that he had to write one bit <br />every week. he was comitting himself in print with no opportunity to <br />correct himself if he was found to be wrong.</p>
<p>in this group we ran a discussion a year back on the errors of kalki.</p>
<p>this particular chronology of events was discussed and I remember <br />swetha came out with some conclusions based on the ages of the <br />charecters.<br />you are right .<br />sendan amudan just does not fit into the chronology, because he could <br />have even been born on the same day as nandini.<br />also in one paragraph nandini's identity ( as daughter/ wife of ) was <br />also confused by kalki.</p>
<p>so I suggest lets cut out the research and enjoy kalki's story <br />telling.</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<p>Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by karuthirumman <br />and when she was rescued, she was pregnant. Is it possible that she <br />had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That has not been mentioned <br />right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani gave birth to twins in <br />Sembiyan Madevi's palace and that the replacement happened after a few <br />days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which means right after Senthan <br />amudhan was born, the twins were born. But it is also said When the <br />pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar happened,Kandarathitha chozhar's <br />son(madurantakan) was one year old. I think only because of that <br />reason the guards went searching for Sundara Chozhar in the first <br />place. And only during the pattabhishekam , Oomai rani tried to kill <br />herself by falling off the light house and then was rescued and found <br />to be pregnant. Now don't you think that is confusing? Please correct <br />me if my argument is wrong. </p>

<p>  so he created a charecter called senthan amuthan who becomes uthama <br />  sola.<br />  amutha and uthama are anagrams.</p>

        <p>Hi Venkatesh, <br />First, you can call me Poornima, cut the Sai. </p>
<p>Two, thanks for that. Karuthiruman should also have been fictious. True, he was 'the one' who played a major role.. </p>
<p>Clear this one for me... this is from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  ...</p>
<p>Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by karuthirumman and when she was rescued, she was pregnant. Is it possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that?

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Lets revisit the facts again. Why do people believe it was Uthama?</p>
<p>the facts as we know them. If I have missed some please correct me:</p>
<p>a) Aditya Karikalan kills Pandiyan king and displays his severed head at<br />fort wall<br />b) Aditya Karikalan gets murdered.<br />c) Uthama gets the throne after Sundara Chozhar<br />d) <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  gets the throne after Uthama and not Uthama's son<br />e) After <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  attains throne, Ravidasan and co (referred to as Drohin) are<br />banished from Chozha Nadu</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>With just these facts in hand, I find it very difficult to pin blame one way<br />or the other. Circumstantial evidence might enable us to say, as Kalki did<br />that Uthama might have been involved and hence was deposed. The other idea<br />could be the Pandiyan angle. Although again, displaying severed heads of<br />enemy kings at the fort was something that was done fairly regularly in<br />those days. I belive that the evidence is rather flimsy either which way.<br />Were Ravidasan and co ever mentioned in connection with the murder of <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym in<br />the kalvettu? Or only as Drohins? If only as Drohins, that might have been<br />for just revealing secrets of state to the enemy. Remember that we associate<br />Ravidasan and Co with AK's murder purely based on Kalki's book I think. (If<br />I am mistaken and there indeed is some mention of Ravidasan and co in<br />connection with AK's murder in some kalvettu, please correct me).</acronym></p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi all</p>
<p>antha naal niyaabakam.......</p>
<p>a literal flood of knowledgable mails.</p>
<p>I would like to express my views too.</p>
<p>first of all we should be able to seperate and see the attributes of a <br />king.<br />if building temples is the only criterion for a good king uthama was <br />better off than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . a shaivaite revivalism happened during his times.<br />the other face of the cholas was made visible to history during his <br />rule.</acronym></p>
<p>I still beleive the pandyas were responsible for aaditya karikalans <br />murder. they avenged the atrocities of AK ( not arun krishnan) in <br />sevuur.<br />but for a common enemy , the remaining cholas would not have been <br />united thereafter.just imagine the scenario <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  spurning the throne <br />and the same deed repeated by uthama's son 14 years later.</acronym></p>
<p>in case uthama was the culprit ,just a thought. would we term the <br />pandavas of mahabaratha as murderors for killing their cousins? they <br />were trying to get their throne back( though it righfully belonged to <br />the kauravas) similarly uthama as a kshatriya was allowed to get back <br />his rightful throne by any means.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  wow.. quite a lot of mails :) Looks like I really set the cat <br />amongst the<br />  pigeons here!</p>
<p>  Dear SPS,</p>
<p>  I think your mentioning that this was a religious issue (or that I <br />had made<br />  it so ) is IMHO fallacious. It doesn't matter WHY RRC built the <br />Periya<br />  Kovil, it is still a magnificent temple. The greatness of a place of <br />worship<br />  I think does not lie with who built it or who gave how many <br />kalanjiams of<br />  gold to it. If that were the case, with all the unscrupulous <br />politicians<br />  visiting Tirupathi and dumping their black money into the hundis,<br />  Tirupathi's lustre would have been lost long ago. That hasn't <br />happened.<br />  Hence, criticizing RRC or raising the contention that RRC might not <br />have<br />  been as innocent as one is assured that he was (on what basis one <br />does not<br />  know) does NOT in any way detract from his marvellous achievement of<br />  building the Periya Kovil.</p>
<p>  Let me put another scenario: Perhaps a young RRC was completely <br />dominated by<br />  Kundavai and hence was part of the conspiracy to eliminate AK. <br />However, with<br />  age comes maturity (and wisdom hopefully). Or perhaps he turned to <br />religion<br />  later on and realized that what he had done was wrong.. this is <br />usual human<br />  nature right? Where we realize as we grow older that some of the <br />things we<br />  did when we were young was not quite cricket.. It is possible that <br />RRC had a<br />  change of heart later...</p>
<p>  However, more than RRC, I believe Kundavai's role needs to be delved <br />into...</p>
<p>  As for why RRC and Kundavai waited for 16 years after AK's death to <br />reclaim<br />  the throne.. here is an alternative scenario.. perhaps RRC and <br />Kundavai<br />  assumed that with AK gone, the throne would automatically come to <br />RRC ..<br />  Perhaps they didnt expect the other warlords like<br />  Sambuvaraiyars/Pazhuvettaraiyars etc to throw their collective <br />weights<br />  behind Uthama Chola. Perhaps the 16 year period was filled with <br />intrigue<br />  with each side manouvering for position. I would suspect that the<br />  Pazhuvettaraiyars would have passed on by the end of the 16 years <br />leaving<br />  the RRC/Kundavai jodi with enough balance of power to ultimately <br />make the<br />  move on the throne.</p>
<p>  All this is speculation of course. My only contention is that, if <br />anyone<br />  wants to "investigate" a murder, leaving out ANYONE from the list of<br />  suspects is a bad idea. The idea should be to treat EVERYONE as a <br />suspect<br />  and then go on from there eliminating people one by one.</p>
<p>  Btw, another twist to the story could be that AK was such a vile <br />person that<br />  his elimination was in the best interests of the Chozhas and so <br />Kundavai/RRC<br />  had to reluctantly do it. Maybe AK actually "imprisoned" the King in <br />the pon<br />  maaligai. :) How about that?</p>

<p>    Hi All,</p>
<p>    Think of another conspiracy theory of RRC being able to control <br />Uthama<br />    chola for 16 long years(an extra-constitutional power eg. sonia).. <br />then one<br />    day he gets tired of all this non-sense.. fine let me be the <br />consitution<br />    itself.. ;)</p>
<p>    just kidding.. another line of thought..</p>
<p>    Also as SPS or someone else had pointed out, humans tend to <br />believe what<br />    they want to believe.. eg... we have been so fantasised by the <br />greatness of<br />    colas that we refuse to believe that have always been part of the <br />land and<br />    our cultures for thousands of years...</p>
<p>    Mind you, we all have been swayed by the literary exposition of <br />KALKI.. NO<br />    doubt that we will refuse to believe anything and everything that <br />would go<br />    against the path of growth identified in the Ponniyen selvan..</p>
<p>    mughals had always had brothers fighting brothers.. except in some <br />cases<br />    in the hindu kingdoms.. eldest always ruled..</p>
<p>    Sandilyan did build a part of the core of his story for Kadal <br />puraa aournd<br />    Kulothungan's exile from his own kingdom(chalukya cholas from <br />eastern<br />    chalukya or vengi)..</p>
<p>    Also PS storyline has something similar to the way in which first<br />    kulothungan came to power in the chola country..</p>

<p>    Hi Arun @ Aditya Karikalan,<br />    ( Sound pretty Good!!!).</p>
<p>    if RRC is the culprit as per your view, why should he wait for 12 <br />years to<br />    come to the power, why should he allow UTHAMA CHOLAN to be in <br />power for 12<br />    years ? For the one who killed the bravest AK, will it be a matter <br />to Kill<br />    UTHAMA CHOLAN ?</p>
<p>    RRC got the idea of building the Big temple for Lord Shiva after <br />he saw<br />    the huge Butha Vihars in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>    So please don't defame his glory by your baseles views.</p>

<p>    haha... maybe I should use Aditya Karikalan as my punaip peyar!:-<br />D</p>
<p>    Seriously though, why isn't this feasible? Surely RRC was an <br />ambitious<br />    person... his willingness to use force to expand his state's <br />territory is a<br />    sure sign of that. Most successful, ambitious people are ruthless <br />to a<br />    certain degree. So why can't the scenario that I dished out be <br />true? His<br />    having built the Periya Kovil can be thought of as atonement for <br />his "sin"<br />    of killing his own brother :-D</p>

<p>        Shall I throw a a heretical thought here? What if<br />        RRC was involved? What if<br />        his and Kundavai's overarching ambitions led to his<br />        hiring some goons to<br />        kill AK? What if Ravidasan and co are actually<br />        innocent but RRC later on<br />        threw suspicion on them to avoid being implicated in<br />        the murder? :-)</p>

<p>          Hi Sps</p>
<p>          thats fantastic..</p>
<p>          now we can also be happy the the old cases of<br />        history are being<br />          solved.<br />          the national geographic did such an investigation<br />        ( including ct scan<br />          of the body) of tutankhamen of egyp who was also<br />        possibly murdered.</p>
<p>          I am very happy uthama was absolved. we have had<br />        similar discussions<br />          in the past and many members have said that uthama<br />        could have easily<br />          wiped out rrc with an accidental death.<br />          but my reasons are purely literary and partisan.<br />          kalki was not keen to pin it on senthan amuthan or<br />        mathuranthakan.</p>
<p>          but first of all I would request you to explain to<br />        us where udayarkudi<br />          is , and in what circumstances the kalvettu was<br />        discovered.</p>

<p>            Dear Friends,</p>
<p>            Pls recall details of the Udayarkudi incriptions<br />        posted in the Photo<br />            Section (due to paucity of storing space in the<br />        Files Section.)</p>
<p>            A Retd Dy Suptt of Police (DSP)Sri RAMARAJ from<br />        CBI, who was in the<br />            team that investigated Late PM Rajiv Gandhi's<br />        murder, has been<br />            concentrating on Aditha Karikalan's murder for<br />        the past 3 - 4 years.<br />            Now settled in Chennai, he has contacted Dr.<br />        Kalaikkovan (who did<br />            mention this when I spoke last week) &amp; Dr.<br />        Kudavoil. He had gone<br />            through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions<br />        and opined. He has<br />            been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we<br />        met and spent some<br />            time on this subject.</p>
<p>            FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review<br />        this subject from the<br />            angle of investigating agency which has<br />        specialised in Poltical<br />            assassinations. Secondly such person has already<br />        invested 3 -4<br />            years of hard work in going into several<br />        inscriptions, write ups,<br />            books and other sources apart from personal<br />        interviews with<br />            acknowledged Scholars on this subject.</p>
<p>            With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the<br />        Udayarkudi<br />            inscriptions and certain details evolved :</p>
<p>            1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji's murder<br />        &amp; AK's murder.<br />            2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD.<br />            Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both<br />        / other reasons..?<br />            How : ??<br />            WHO :: ??<br />            3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light<br />        on the above ..<br />            reviewed..<br />            4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..</p>
<p>            Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the<br />        insctiptions a decade<br />            back, personally I have been maintaining that<br />        UTHAMA has a hand in<br />            the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has<br />        been disturbing me.</p>
<p>            This gentleman made me to look at this from<br />        another angle::</p>
<p>            The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja's<br />        SAFETY till he<br />            ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the<br />        mechanism to wipe of<br />            RRC if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He<br />        could not be Drohin.</p>
<p>            Kudavoil has been maintaining that the<br />        CONFISCATION OF LANDS took<br />            place during Uthama's tenure..</p>
<p>            If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes<br />        under cloud..</p>
<p>            Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under<br />        Sundara or Uthama?<br />            Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule<br />        in Pandya Kingdom?</p>
<p>            But when certain matters were subjected under<br />        scrutiny, the opinion<br />            is still swinging ..</p>
<p>            It was an interesting experience to talk to him.<br />        I have agreed to<br />            provide certain materials for his expert review.</p>
<p>            Will report more in due course. sps</p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Having read some of the previous discussions on the<br />topic, I think this discussion is proceeding purely on<br />the basis of speculation. While <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  as a suspect is a<br />diversion, I dont think there are facts or evidence<br />supporting this. What <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym has done is assume a few<br />things and built a hypothesis with <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Kundavai as<br />conspirators but has offered no evidence. Cruelty by<br />Tamil kings has some truth in it (eg. Kabilar's songs<br />on Nannan, who supposedly raped and pillaged the<br />losers Kingdom). I think if a simple explanation is<br />suffice, then the complex is ruled out (occum's<br />razor!). The people with straight motive seems to be<br />the guards of Veera pandiyan(with probably the Cheras<br />helping out) and Utthama chola (who is rightfully the<br />heir). <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym has to build a roundabout conspiracy theory<br />for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Kundavai to kill Aditya and it doesn't<br />explain the 16 year break in the rule. Also the act of<br />sacrificing the throne to Uthama doesn't gel (please<br />dont bring Sonia here!!). <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym asks to assume two<br />things. In a previous mail, it says <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  has done great<br />things by his 16th year and thus is capable of murder.<br />In a recent one, it says he was dominated by Kundavai<br />and was driven to murder. Both are at best tangential<br />at each other. If we take it that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  killed AK, it<br />still means Uthama is standing in his way and has to<br />be eliminated. If we make <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , Kundavai and Uthama as<br />the parties to AKs murder, It leaves Uthama at a<br />stronger position to expose <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym /Kundavai's hand in the<br />murder. It needs another explanation as to why Uthama<br />didn't expose <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's hand in murder and securing the<br />line for his descendants. If we leave Uthama out of<br />this conspiracy, then the question is why did <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  wait<br />16 years for claiming the throne?. Apart from the<br />empathy for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  shown by this group, I dont think<br />logically the '<acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  conspiracy' theory stands closer<br />scrutiny and thus had to be eliminated. </acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>While AKs suggestion can be made into a sensational<br />book and will help in selling it, I dont think it has<br />any logical basis for it. </p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>

<p>What is the proof of this? Please don't quote Kalki as proof since his story<br />is part history part fiction.</p>

<p>  Here's my two cents worth:</p>
<p>  If RRC had wanted the throne, why did he decline the throne offered by the<br />  Buddihst Monks in Ceylon when he was matured enough for his age to consider<br />  murdering his brother? He could have taken up the throne, gathered enough<br />  support &amp; captured the throne from anyone, be it AK or Utthama.</p>

<p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  wow.. quite a lot of mails :) Looks like I really set the cat amongst the<br />  pigeons here!</p>
<p>  Dear SPS,</p>
<p>  I think your mentioning that this was a religious issue (or that I had<br />  made it so ) is IMHO fallacious. It doesn't matter WHY RRC built the Periya<br />  Kovil, it is still a magnificent temple. The greatness of a place of worship<br />  I think does not lie with who built it or who gave how many kalanjiams of<br />  gold to it. If that were the case, with all the unscrupulous politicians<br />  visiting Tirupathi and dumping their black money into the hundis,<br />  Tirupathi's lustre would have been lost long ago. That hasn't happened.<br />  Hence, criticizing RRC or raising the contention that RRC might not have<br />  been as innocent as one is assured that he was (on what basis one does not<br />  know) does NOT in any way detract from his marvellous achievement of<br />  building the Periya Kovil.</p>
<p>  Let me put another scenario: Perhaps a young RRC was completely dominated<br />  by Kundavai and hence was part of the conspiracy to eliminate AK. However,<br />  with age comes maturity (and wisdom hopefully). Or perhaps he turned to<br />  religion later on and realized that what he had done was wrong.. this is<br />  usual human nature right? Where we realize as we grow older that some of the<br />  things we did when we were young was not quite cricket.. It is possible that<br />  RRC had a change of heart later...</p>
<p>  However, more than RRC, I believe Kundavai's role needs to be delved<br />  into...</p>
<p>  As for why RRC and Kundavai waited for 16 years after AK's death to<br />  reclaim the throne.. here is an alternative scenario.. perhaps RRC and<br />  Kundavai assumed that with AK gone, the throne would automatically come to<br />  RRC .. Perhaps they didnt expect the other warlords like<br />  Sambuvaraiyars/Pazhuvettaraiyars etc to throw their collective weights<br />  behind Uthama Chola. Perhaps the 16 year period was filled with intrigue<br />  with each side manouvering for position. I would suspect that the<br />  Pazhuvettaraiyars would have passed on by the end of the 16 years leaving<br />  the RRC/Kundavai jodi with enough balance of power to ultimately make the<br />  move on the throne.</p>
<p>  All this is speculation of course. My only contention is that, if anyone<br />  wants to "investigate" a murder, leaving out ANYONE from the list of<br />  suspects is a bad idea. The idea should be to treat EVERYONE as a suspect<br />  and then go on from there eliminating people one by one.</p>
<p>  Btw, another twist to the story could be that AK was such a vile person<br />  that his elimination was in the best interests of the Chozhas and so<br />  Kundavai/RRC had to reluctantly do it. Maybe AK actually "imprisoned" the<br />  King in the pon maaligai. :) How about that?</p>

<p>    Hi All,</p>
<p>    Think of another conspiracy theory of RRC being able to control Uthama<br />    chola for 16 long years(an extra-constitutional power eg. sonia).. then one<br />    day he gets tired of all this non-sense.. fine let me be the consitution<br />    itself.. ;)</p>
<p>    just kidding.. another line of thought..</p>
<p>    Also as SPS or someone else had pointed out, humans tend to believe what<br />    they want to believe.. eg... we have been so fantasised by the greatness of<br />    colas that we refuse to believe that have always been part of the land and<br />    our cultures for thousands of years...</p>
<p>    Mind you, we all have been swayed by the literary exposition of KALKI..<br />    NO doubt that we will refuse to believe anything and everything that would<br />    go against the path of growth identified in the Ponniyen selvan..</p>
<p>    mughals had always had brothers fighting brothers.. except in some cases<br />    in the hindu kingdoms.. eldest always ruled..</p>
<p>    Sandilyan did build a part of the core of his story for Kadal puraa<br />    aournd Kulothungan's exile from his own kingdom(chalukya cholas from eastern<br />    chalukya or vengi)..</p>
<p>    Also PS storyline has something similar to the way in which first<br />    kulothungan came to power in the chola country..</p>

<p>    Hi Arun @ Aditya Karikalan,<br />    ( Sound pretty Good!!!).</p>
<p>    if RRC is the culprit as per your view, why should he wait for 12 years<br />    to come to the power, why should he allow UTHAMA CHOLAN to be in power for<br />    12 years ? For the one who killed the bravest AK, will it be a matter to<br />    Kill UTHAMA CHOLAN ?</p>
<p>    RRC got the idea of building the Big temple for Lord Shiva after he saw<br />    the huge Butha Vihars in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>    So please don't defame his glory by your baseles views.</p>

<p>    haha... maybe I should use Aditya Karikalan as my punaip peyar!:-D</p>
<p>    Seriously though, why isn't this feasible? Surely RRC was an ambitious<br />    person... his willingness to use force to expand his state's territory is a<br />    sure sign of that. Most successful, ambitious people are ruthless to a<br />    certain degree. So why can't the scenario that I dished out be true? His<br />    having built the Periya Kovil can be thought of as atonement for his "sin"<br />    of killing his own brother :-D</p>

<p>          Hi Sps</p>
<p>          thats fantastic..</p>
<p>          now we can also be happy the the old cases of<br />        history are being<br />          solved.<br />          the national geographic did such an investigation<br />        ( including ct scan<br />          of the body) of tutankhamen of egyp who was also<br />        possibly murdered.</p>
<p>          I am very happy uthama was absolved. we have had<br />        similar discussions<br />          in the past and many members have said that uthama<br />        could have easily<br />          wiped out rrc with an accidental death.<br />          but my reasons are purely literary and partisan.<br />          kalki was not keen to pin it on senthan amuthan or<br />        mathuranthakan.</p>
<p>          but first of all I would request you to explain to<br />        us where udayarkudi<br />          is , and in what circumstances the kalvettu was<br />        discovered.</p>

<p>            Dear Friends,</p>
<p>            Pls recall details of the Udayarkudi incriptions<br />        posted in the Photo<br />            Section (due to paucity of storing space in the<br />        Files Section.)</p>
<p>            A Retd Dy Suptt of Police (DSP)Sri RAMARAJ from<br />        CBI, who was in the<br />            team that investigated Late PM Rajiv Gandhi's<br />        murder, has been<br />            concentrating on Aditha Karikalan's murder for<br />        the past 3 - 4 years.<br />            Now settled in Chennai, he has contacted Dr.<br />        Kalaikkovan (who did<br />            mention this when I spoke last week) &amp; Dr.<br />        Kudavoil. He had gone<br />            through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions<br />        and opined. He has<br />            been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we<br />        met and spent some<br />            time on this subject.</p>
<p>            FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review<br />        this subject from the<br />            angle of investigating agency which has<br />        specialised in Poltical<br />            assassinations. Secondly such person has already<br />        invested 3 -4<br />            years of hard work in going into several<br />        inscriptions, write ups,<br />            books and other sources apart from personal<br />        interviews with<br />            acknowledged Scholars on this subject.</p>
<p>            With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the<br />        Udayarkudi<br />            inscriptions and certain details evolved :</p>
<p>            1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji's murder<br />        &amp; AK's murder.<br />            2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD.<br />            Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both<br />        / other reasons..?<br />            How : ??<br />            WHO :: ??<br />            3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light<br />        on the above ..<br />            reviewed..<br />            4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..</p>
<p>            Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the<br />        insctiptions a decade<br />            back, personally I have been maintaining that<br />        UTHAMA has a hand in<br />            the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has<br />        been disturbing me.</p>
<p>            This gentleman made me to look at this from<br />        another angle::</p>
<p>            The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja's<br />        SAFETY till he<br />            ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the<br />        mechanism to wipe of<br />            RRC if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He<br />        could not be Drohin.</p>
<p>            Kudavoil has been maintaining that the<br />        CONFISCATION OF LANDS took<br />            place during Uthama's tenure..</p>
<p>            If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes<br />        under cloud..</p>
<p>            Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under<br />        Sundara or Uthama?<br />            Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule<br />        in Pandya Kingdom?</p>
<p>            But when certain matters were subjected under<br />        scrutiny, the opinion<br />            is still swinging ..</p>
<p>            It was an interesting experience to talk to him.<br />        I have agreed to<br />            provide certain materials for his expert review.</p>
<p>            Will report more in due course. sps</p>

<p>character and the events to support and build Arulmozhi's <br />character.

<p>Secondly, Pls recall IMAYA VARAMBAN NEDUNCHERALATHAN - Pandian / <br />CHERAN CHENGUTTUVAN (Cheran) WHO BROUGHT STONE FROM GANGES. Also the <br />ANTWERP (CAMBODIA) temples were reportedly built by Pandyas. ( Our <br />Archieves contain enormous details on these.)</p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Talking about Mandakini devi.. Kalki has written the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  builts a temple name Singhala-nachiyar kovil.. and mentions that this temple is currently known as "Singachiyar" kovil and is in ruins in Thanjavur... and hence Mandikini devi is not fictious.. or thats the line that I will draw.. </p>
<p>Also, these characters Nandini, Madurantakan(Pandian), Alwar kadiyaan, manimekalai, parthibendran(some extent), kandhan maravel are not historically supported and hence can be assumed to be fictional in nature..</p>
<p>Kalki's notes towards the end of the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  book points out some of this information.</p>
<p>Also talking about AK's murder, I do feel that Kalki would have gone in depth and in detail with regards to understanding <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's character and the events to support and build Arulmozhi's character. Remember like every other heroic character he has built it up with character formation backgrounds through the 5 books.</p>
<p>As such our varalaaru group articles have also point out the benevelont nature of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , and infact, the real growth of the Tamil nation from a fragmented society to an integrated society was brought only by forming big empires(Pallavas, Cholas) had the capability and ambition to do that, while Pandyas and Cheras have never gone beyond the North Pennar(Please correct me, I am not a historian) which has always been thought to be northern border for erstwhile tamil empires. </p>

<p>In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , it is said that Nandini and Madurantakan( Valarpu pillai of Sembiyan Madevi) are twins. Does this mean Madurantakan is also fictious? Does it mean Senthan Amudhan was the only son (born or brought up) of Sembiyan Madevi? Why has Kalki introduced this twist? <br />Nandini doesn't affect any other character other than AK. Azhwarkku Adiyan also doesn't affect anything. What about Mandakini? She saves the king from falling victim to the plan of the Pandiyan aabathudavigal right? Is it possible somebody had really saved Sundara Chozhan from the enemies? </acronym></p>

If so.... the <br />conspiracy theory against Karikala within the Chola family gets <br />stronger.....<br />==================<br />Dear Sir, </acronym></p>
<p>Thanks for your Attention.</p>
<p>These queries DID figure in the Discussions. <br />We will discuss more in detail in due course.</p>
<p>Since members are showing enormous interest (obviously), let us help <br />them identifying the REAL CHARACTERS and FICTITIOUS ones..<br />Nandhini - Mandakini - Alwarkadiyan .. Manimegalai .. Fictitious.</p>
<p>Kandamaran need to be assumed as a rep of Kurunila mannar. <br />Sambuvarayars are traced only in the 11th Century Historically.</p>
<p>The <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Story takes place in the year 969 AD (10th Century).</p>
<p>Parthibendran - there is Copper plate talking of him. Even Sastry <br />is not able to IDENTIFY who he is.. speculations are made ..</p>
<p>Anirudh(PM of Sundara) - <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  - Kundavai - Arumozhi - Veerapandiyan - <br />Periya Pazhuvettarayar :: Real. Chinna P - Unreal.<br />Vaanathi Real. She is Mother of Rajendra. But Patta Mahishi of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  <br />is OLAGA MADEVI @ Danthi Sakthi Vidangi.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Uthama is normally hailed as "Sembiyan madevi thiruvayirudhitha <br />Uthama Chozha thevar ..". Dr. Kalaikkovan observed that Rajendra is <br />also notified similarly after his mother's name in Thiruvalanchuzhi <br />inscriptions. Pls Read Valachuzhi Vaanar by Dr. Kkvn.</p>
<p>Dear Friends, Please pour your views .. </p>
<p>Our Group will definitely make some progress in solving this mystry <br />over a period of time.</p>

        <p>Devi,</p>
<p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was an equally great warrior. He also had a good army. Besides there were the pazhuvettaraiyars. If <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had accepted the throne, he would have betrayed the trust of the kingdom and the people and earned the enemity of his brothers and other big generals in the King's army. He was only a prince. By custom, the eldest should be the first to assume position and responsibility. If he had accepted the throne, his own people would have turned against him. Besides, there was also the problem of food and equipment. If his people had turned against him, he would not get the necessary commodities. Why leave a big Chola kingdom and settle for a small battle ravaged Ceylon?</p>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>wow.. quite a lot of mails :) Looks like I really set the cat amongst the pigeons here! </p>
<p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>I think your mentioning that this was a religious issue (or that I had made it so ) is <acronym title="In my humble opinion" IMHO</acronym  fallacious. It doesn't matter WHY <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  built the Periya Kovil, it is still a magnificent temple. The greatness of a place of worship I think does not lie with who built it or who gave how many kalanjiams of gold to it. If that were the case, with all the unscrupulous politicians visiting Tirupathi and dumping their black money into the hundis, Tirupathi's lustre would have been lost long ago. That hasn't happened. Hence, criticizing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  or raising the contention that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  might not have been as innocent as one is assured that he was (on what basis one does not know) does NOT in any way detract from his marvellous achievement of building the Periya Kovil. </p>
<p>Let me put another scenario: Perhaps a young <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was completely dominated by Kundavai and hence was part of the conspiracy to eliminate AK. However, with age comes maturity (and wisdom hopefully). Or perhaps he turned to religion later on and realized that what he had done was wrong.. this is usual human nature right? Where we realize as we grow older that some of the things we did when we were young was not quite cricket.. It is possible that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had a change of heart later... </p>
<p>However, more than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , I believe Kundavai's role needs to be delved into...</p>
<p>As for why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Kundavai waited for 16 years after AK's death to reclaim the throne.. here is an alternative scenario.. perhaps <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Kundavai assumed that with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym gone, the throne would automatically come to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  .. Perhaps they didnt expect the other warlords like Sambuvaraiyars/Pazhuvettaraiyars etc to throw their collective weights behind Uthama Chola. Perhaps the 16 year period was filled with intrigue with each side manouvering for position. I would suspect that the Pazhuvettaraiyars would have passed on by the end of the 16 years leaving the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym /Kundavai jodi with enough balance of power to ultimately make the move on the throne. </p>
<p>All this is speculation of course. My only contention is that, if anyone wants to "investigate" a murder, leaving out ANYONE from the list of suspects is a bad idea. The idea should be to treat EVERYONE as a suspect and then go on from there eliminating people one by one. </p>
<p>Btw, another twist to the story could be that <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was such a vile person that his elimination was in the best interests of the Chozhas and so Kundavai/RRC had to reluctantly do it. Maybe <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym actually "imprisoned" the King in the pon maaligai. :) How about that? </p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>Think of another conspiracy theory of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  being able to control Uthama chola for 16 long years(an extra-constitutional power eg. sonia).. then one day he gets tired of all this non-sense.. fine let me be the consitution itself.. ;) </p>
<p>just kidding.. another line of thought.. </p>
<p>Also as SPS or someone else had pointed out, humans tend to believe what they want to believe.. eg... we have been so fantasised by the greatness of colas that we refuse to believe that have always been part of the land and our cultures for thousands of years... </p>
<p>Mind you, we all have been swayed by the literary exposition of KALKI.. NO doubt that we will refuse to believe anything and everything that would go against the path of growth identified in the Ponniyen selvan.. </p>
<p>mughals had always had brothers fighting brothers.. except in some cases in the hindu kingdoms.. eldest always ruled.. </p>
<p>Sandilyan did build a part of the core of his story for Kadal puraa aournd Kulothungan's exile from his own kingdom(chalukya cholas from eastern chalukya or vengi).. </p>
<p>Also <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  storyline has something similar to the way in which first kulothungan came to power in the chola country.. </p>

<p>if <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is the culprit as per your view, why should he wait for 12 years to come to the power, why should he allow UTHAMA CHOLAN to be in power for 12 years ? For the one who killed the bravest AK, will it be a matter to Kill UTHAMA CHOLAN ? </p>
<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  got the idea of building the Big temple for Lord Shiva after he saw the huge Butha Vihars in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>So please don't defame his glory by your baseles views.</p>

<p>Seriously though, why isn't this feasible? Surely <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was an ambitious person... his willingness to use force to expand his state's territory is a sure sign of that. Most successful, ambitious people are ruthless to a certain degree. So why can't the scenario that I dished out be true? His having built the Periya Kovil can be thought of as atonement for his "sin" of killing his own brother :-D </p>

<p>    now we can also be happy the the old cases of<br />  history are being<br />    solved.<br />    the national geographic did such an investigation<br />  ( including ct scan<br />    of the body) of tutankhamen of egyp who was also<br />  possibly murdered.</p>

<p>      Dear Friends, </p>
<p>      Pls recall details of the Udayarkudi incriptions<br />  posted in the Photo<br />      Section (due to paucity of storing space in the<br />  Files Section.)</p>
<p>      A Retd Dy Suptt of Police (DSP)Sri RAMARAJ from<br />  CBI, who was in the <br />      team that investigated Late PM Rajiv Gandhi's<br />  murder, has been<br />      concentrating on Aditha Karikalan's murder for<br />  the past 3 - 4 years.<br />      Now settled in Chennai, he has contacted Dr. <br />  Kalaikkovan (who did<br />      mention this when I spoke last week) &amp; Dr.<br />  Kudavoil. He had gone<br />      through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions<br />  and opined. He has<br />      been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we <br />  met and spent some<br />      time on this subject.</p>
<p>      FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review<br />  this subject from the<br />      angle of investigating agency which has<br />  specialised in Poltical<br />      assassinations. Secondly such person has already<br />  invested 3 -4<br />      years of hard work in going into several<br />  inscriptions, write ups,<br />      books and other sources apart from personal<br />  interviews with<br />      acknowledged Scholars on this subject.</p>
<p>      With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the <br />  Udayarkudi<br />      inscriptions and certain details evolved :</p>
<p>      1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji's murder<br />  &amp; AK's murder.<br />      2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD. <br />      Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both<br />  / other reasons..?<br />      How : ??<br />      WHO :: ??<br />      3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light<br />  on the above .. <br />      reviewed..<br />      4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..</p>
<p>      Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the<br />  insctiptions a decade<br />      back, personally I have been maintaining that<br />  UTHAMA has a hand in <br />      the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has<br />  been disturbing me.</p>
<p>      This gentleman made me to look at this from<br />  another angle::</p>
<p>      The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja's<br />  SAFETY till he<br />      ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the<br />  mechanism to wipe of<br />      RRC if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He <br />  could not be Drohin.</p>

<p>      If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes <br />  under cloud..</p>
<p>      Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under<br />  Sundara or Uthama?<br />      Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule<br />  in Pandya Kingdom?</p>
<p>      But when certain matters were subjected under<br />  scrutiny, the opinion<br />      is still swinging ..</p>
<p>      It was an interesting experience to talk to him.<br />  I have agreed to<br />      provide certain materials for his expert review.</p>
<p>      Will report more in due course. sps</p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p><html<br />
<div style='background-color:' <P Hi All,</P <br /><P Here's my two cents worth: </P <br /></p><P If <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had wanted the throne, why did he decline the throne offered by the Buddihst Monks in Ceylon when he was matured enough for his age to consider murdering his brother? He could have taken up the throne, gathered enough support &amp; captured the throne from anyone, be it <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym or Utthama.</P <br /></p><P Devi<BR <BR </P <br /><BLOCKQUOTE style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #a0c6e5 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" <FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 11px; FONT-FAMILY: tahoma,sans-serif" <br /><HR color=#a0c6e5 SIZE=1 <br />From: <I "Arun Krishnan" &lt;drarunkrishnan@gmail.com&gt;</I <BR Reply-To: <I ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</I <BR To: <I ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</I <BR Subject: <I Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK's MURDER</I <BR Date: <I Thu, 15 Jun 2006 05:29:50 +0900</I <BR <BR <br /><META content="Microsoft SafeHTML" name=Generator <br /><DIV id=ygrp-mlmsg <br /><DIV id=ygrp-msg style="PADDING-RIGHT: 20px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; Z-INDEX: 1; FLOAT: left; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; WIDTH: 530px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; POSITION: relative" <br /><DIV id=ygrp-text <br /><P Dear All,<BR <BR wow.. quite a lot of mails :) Looks like I really set the cat amongst the pigeons here! <BR <BR Dear SPS,<BR <BR I think your mentioning that this was a religious issue (or that I had made it so ) is <acronym title="In my humble opinion" IMHO</acronym  fallacious. It doesn't matter WHY <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  built the Periya Kovil, it is still a magnificent temple. The greatness of a place of worship I think does not lie with who built it or who gave how many kalanjiams of gold to it. If that were the case, with all the unscrupulous politicians visiting Tirupathi and dumping their black money into the hundis, Tirupathi's lustre would have been lost long ago. That hasn't happened. Hence, criticizing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  or raising the contention that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  might not have been as innocent as one is assured that he was (on what basis one does not know) does NOT in any way detract from his marvellous achievement of building the Periya Kovil. <BR <BR Let me <br />put another scenario: Perhaps a young <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was completely dominated by Kundavai and hence was part of the conspiracy to eliminate AK. However, with age comes maturity (and wisdom hopefully). Or perhaps he turned to religion later on and realized that what he had done was wrong.. this is usual human nature right? Where we realize as we grow older that some of the things we did when we were young was not quite cricket.. It is possible that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had a change of heart later... <BR <BR However, more than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , I believe Kundavai's role needs to be delved into...<BR <BR As for why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Kundavai waited for 16 years after AK's death to reclaim the throne.. here is an alternative scenario.. perhaps <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Kundavai assumed that with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym gone, the throne would automatically come to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  .. Perhaps they didnt expect the other warlords like Sambuvaraiyars/Pazhuvettaraiyars etc to throw their <br />collective weights behind Uthama Chola. Perhaps the 16 year period was filled with intrigue with each side manouvering for position. I would suspect that the Pazhuvettaraiyars would have passed on by the end of the 16 years leaving the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym /Kundavai jodi with enough balance of power to ultimately make the move on the throne. <BR <BR All this is speculation of course. My only contention is that, if anyone wants to "investigate" a murder, leaving out ANYONE from the list of suspects is a bad idea. The idea should be to treat EVERYONE as a suspect and then go on from there eliminating people one by one. <BR <BR Btw, another twist to the story could be that <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was such a vile person that his elimination was in the best interests of the Chozhas and so Kundavai/RRC had to reluctantly do it. Maybe <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym actually "imprisoned" the King in the pon maaligai. :) How about that? <BR <BR Regards,<BR <BR Arun<BR <BR <br /><DIV <SPAN class=gmail_quote On 6/15/06, <B class=gmail_sendername Nandakumar Selvaraj</B  &lt;<A href="mailto:snandaakumar@yahoo.co.in" snandaakumar@yahoo.co.in</A &gt; wrote:</SPAN <br /><BLOCKQUOTE class=gmail_quote <br /><DIV <br /><DIV style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)" <br /><DIV <br /><DIV <br /><DIV <br /><P </P <br /><DIV Hi All,</DIV <br /><DIV &nbsp;</DIV <br /><DIV Think of another conspiracy theory of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  being able to control Uthama chola for 16 long years(an extra-constitutional power eg. sonia).. then one day he gets tired of all this non-sense.. fine let me be the consitution itself.. ;) </DIV <br /><DIV &nbsp;</DIV <br /><DIV just kidding.. another line of thought.. </DIV <br /><DIV &nbsp;</DIV <br /><DIV Also as SPS or someone else had pointed out, humans tend to believe what they want to believe.. eg... we have been so fantasised by the greatness of colas that we refuse to believe that have always been part of the land and our cultures for thousands of years... </DIV <br /><DIV &nbsp;</DIV <br /><DIV Mind you, we all have been swayed by the literary exposition of KALKI..

Secondly such person has already<BR &gt; invested 3 -4<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; years of hard work in going into several<BR &gt; inscriptions, write ups,<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; books and other sources apart from personal<BR &gt; interviews with<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; acknowledged Scholars on this subject.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; With <br />such rich back-ground he has reviewed the <BR &gt; Udayarkudi<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions and certain details evolved :<BR &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi, </p>
<p>In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , it is said that Nandini and Madurantakan( Valarpu pillai of Sembiyan Madevi) are twins. Does this mean Madurantakan is also fictious? Does it mean Senthan Amudhan was the only son (born or brought up) of Sembiyan Madevi? Why has Kalki introduced this twist? <br />Nandini doesn't affect any other character other than AK. Azhwarkku Adiyan also doesn't affect anything. What about Mandakini? She saves the king from falling victim to the plan of the Pandiyan aabathudavigal right? Is it possible somebody had really saved Sundara Chozhan from the enemies? </acronym></p>
<p>Regards,<br />Poornima </p>

<p>mind after 16 years, eventhough that period was peaceful without any <br />major attacks on the kingodm. So can we assume that there was a <br />premediated arrangement between Uthama and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ? If so.... the <br />conspiracy theory against Karikala within the Chola family gets <br />stronger.....<br />==================<br />Dear Sir, </acronym></p>
<p>Thanks for your Attention.</p>
<p>These queries DID figure in the Discussions. <br />We will discuss more in detail in due course.</p>
<p>Since members are showing enormous interest (obviously), let us help <br />them identifying the REAL CHARACTERS and FICTITIOUS ones..<br />Nandhini - Mandakini - Alwarkadiyan .. Manimegalai .. Fictitious.</p>
<p>Kandamaran need to be assumed as a rep of Kurunila mannar. <br />Sambuvarayars are traced only in the 11th Century Historically.</p>
<p>The <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Story takes place in the year 969 AD (10th Century).</p>
<p>Parthibendran - there is Copper plate talking of him. Even Sastry <br />is not able to IDENTIFY who he is.. speculations are made ..</p>
<p>Anirudh(PM of Sundara) - <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  - Kundavai - Arumozhi - Veerapandiyan - <br />Periya Pazhuvettarayar :: Real. Chinna P - Unreal.<br />Vaanathi Real. She is Mother of Rajendra. But Patta Mahishi of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  <br />is OLAGA MADEVI @ Danthi Sakthi Vidangi.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Uthama is normally hailed as "Sembiyan madevi thiruvayirudhitha <br />Uthama Chozha thevar ..". Dr. Kalaikkovan observed that Rajendra is <br />also notified similarly after his mother's name in Thiruvalanchuzhi <br />inscriptions. Pls Read Valachuzhi Vaanar by Dr. Kkvn.</p>
<p>Dear Friends, Please pour your views .. </p>
<p>Our Group will definitely make some progress in solving this mystry <br />over a period of time.</p>

        <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I dont find myself knowledgable enought to comment... but its intriguing...</p>
<p>Also, I second SPS that 'lack of evidence' is what keeps this controversy<br />hot. As a knowledgable and empowered group, its upto us whether</p>
<p>- We are going to keep speculating and providing our point-of-views based on<br />loyalty to characters.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>- We are going to do some research (possibly unearth evidence) that would<br />shed light on what actually happened.</p>
<p>I would say its time for some textual research based on rationality and<br />existing evidence.</p>
<p>Am thinking the best place to find some evidence about the mode/manner of<br />AK's killing would be where he was killed. (Something on the lines of "Here<br />was martyred AK, conqueror of ... etc.,). Are there any known inscriptions<br />like that?</p>
<p>Just my two cents worth.</p>
<p>Could any of you suggest texts by authentic tamil historians on this period,<br />that I could borrow/buy?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  : What happened to the efforts on 'kalvettu payirchi'? Do you need my<br />help on that?</acronym></p>

<p>Dear Arun,</p>
<p>Trend is set on this topic.  </p>
<p>I am sure some one go into the earlier discussions and post more <br />details.</p>
<p>With more materials in hand, let us get into micro-study.</p>
<p>Poonguzhali - unfortunately is Unreal. So also Senthan Amudhan.  </p>
<p>But that is very clever of Kalki. He appeared to have split the <br />Historical Uthama character into two - Madurantagan ( not being <br />heroic) and Sendhan Amudhan ( Sembiyan Madevi Thiruvayirudhitha <br />Uthama Chozha thevar) and projected.. </p>
<p>Kalki has taken the period 969 containing no inscriptional evidence <br />on anything related to Uthama or Arumozhi.  </p>
<p>Dear Members, today in this Forum of less than 1000 members, we are <br />exchanging so much among ourselves.  </p>
<p>Imagine, In 1950 when Kalki wrote this, Neelakanta Sastri and <br />Sadhasiva Pandarathar were alive and Kalki's writings were subjected <br />to the Scruntiny of Dyons of South Indian and Tamil History, <br />Literature, Media and Polity - including Ra.Pi.Sethupillai, <br />Mu.Varadarajanar, Arignar Anna, Dr. Kalaignar, Periyar and Mentors <br />like Vallal Azhagappa Chettiar (Kumudam) Raja Sir Annamalai Chettiar <br />(Omissions inadvertant), Media personalities like Vikatan Vasan, <br />AVM .... Greats of yesteryears!</p>
<p>Who ever criticised also did not have support of inscriptional or <br />documentary evidences to oppose. Tho' 850 to 969 AD was the period <br />covered, the whole story is confined to a single year - eventful <br />year - which cannot be disputed. !</p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>wow.. quite a lot of mails :) Looks like I really set the cat amongst the<br />pigeons here!</p>
<p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>I think your mentioning that this was a religious issue (or that I had made<br />it so ) is <acronym title="In my humble opinion" IMHO</acronym  fallacious. It doesn't matter WHY <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  built the Periya<br />Kovil, it is still a magnificent temple. The greatness of a place of worship<br />I think does not lie with who built it or who gave how many kalanjiams of<br />gold to it. If that were the case, with all the unscrupulous politicians<br />visiting Tirupathi and dumping their black money into the hundis,<br />Tirupathi's lustre would have been lost long ago. That hasn't happened.<br />Hence, criticizing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  or raising the contention that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  might not have<br />been as innocent as one is assured that he was (on what basis one does not<br />know) does NOT in any way detract from his marvellous achievement of<br />building the Periya Kovil.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Let me put another scenario: Perhaps a young <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was completely dominated by<br />Kundavai and hence was part of the conspiracy to eliminate AK. However, with<br />age comes maturity (and wisdom hopefully). Or perhaps he turned to religion<br />later on and realized that what he had done was wrong.. this is usual human<br />nature right? Where we realize as we grow older that some of the things we<br />did when we were young was not quite cricket.. It is possible that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had a<br />change of heart later...</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>However, more than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , I believe Kundavai's role needs to be delved into...</p>
<p>As for why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Kundavai waited for 16 years after AK's death to reclaim<br />the throne.. here is an alternative scenario.. perhaps <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Kundavai<br />assumed that with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym gone, the throne would automatically come to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ..<br />Perhaps they didnt expect the other warlords like<br />Sambuvaraiyars/Pazhuvettaraiyars etc to throw their collective weights<br />behind Uthama Chola. Perhaps the 16 year period was filled with intrigue<br />with each side manouvering for position. I would suspect that the<br />Pazhuvettaraiyars would have passed on by the end of the 16 years leaving<br />the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym /Kundavai jodi with enough balance of power to ultimately make the<br />move on the throne.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>All this is speculation of course. My only contention is that, if anyone<br />wants to "investigate" a murder, leaving out ANYONE from the list of<br />suspects is a bad idea. The idea should be to treat EVERYONE as a suspect<br />and then go on from there eliminating people one by one.</p>
<p>Btw, another twist to the story could be that <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was such a vile person that<br />his elimination was in the best interests of the Chozhas and so Kundavai/RRC<br />had to reluctantly do it. Maybe <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym actually "imprisoned" the King in the pon<br />maaligai. :) How about that?</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>  Think of another conspiracy theory of RRC being able to control Uthama<br />  chola for 16 long years(an extra-constitutional power eg. sonia).. then one<br />  day he gets tired of all this non-sense.. fine let me be the consitution<br />  itself.. ;)</p>
<p>  just kidding.. another line of thought..</p>
<p>  Also as SPS or someone else had pointed out, humans tend to believe what<br />  they want to believe.. eg... we have been so fantasised by the greatness of<br />  colas that we refuse to believe that have always been part of the land and<br />  our cultures for thousands of years...</p>
<p>  Mind you, we all have been swayed by the literary exposition of KALKI.. NO<br />  doubt that we will refuse to believe anything and everything that would go<br />  against the path of growth identified in the Ponniyen selvan..</p>
<p>  mughals had always had brothers fighting brothers.. except in some cases<br />  in the hindu kingdoms.. eldest always ruled..</p>
<p>  Sandilyan did build a part of the core of his story for Kadal puraa aournd<br />  Kulothungan's exile from his own kingdom(chalukya cholas from eastern<br />  chalukya or vengi)..</p>
<p>  Also PS storyline has something similar to the way in which first<br />  kulothungan came to power in the chola country..</p>

<p>  Hi Arun @ Aditya Karikalan,<br />  ( Sound pretty Good!!!).</p>
<p>  if RRC is the culprit as per your view, why should he wait for 12 years to<br />  come to the power, why should he allow UTHAMA CHOLAN to be in power for 12<br />  years ? For the one who killed the bravest AK, will it be a matter to Kill<br />  UTHAMA CHOLAN ?</p>
<p>  RRC got the idea of building the Big temple for Lord Shiva after he saw<br />  the huge Butha Vihars in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>  So please don't defame his glory by your baseles views.</p>

<p>  haha... maybe I should use Aditya Karikalan as my punaip peyar!:-D</p>
<p>  Seriously though, why isn't this feasible? Surely RRC was an ambitious<br />  person... his willingness to use force to expand his state's territory is a<br />  sure sign of that. Most successful, ambitious people are ruthless to a<br />  certain degree. So why can't the scenario that I dished out be true? His<br />  having built the Periya Kovil can be thought of as atonement for his "sin"<br />  of killing his own brother :-D</p>

What if Ravidasan and co are actually<br />      innocent but RRC later on<br />      threw suspicion on them to avoid being implicated in<br />      the murder? :-)</p>

<p>        I am very happy uthama was absolved. we have had<br />      similar discussions<br />        in the past and many members have said that uthama<br />      could have easily<br />        wiped out rrc with an accidental death.<br />        but my reasons are purely literary and partisan.<br />        kalki was not keen to pin it on senthan amuthan or<br />      mathuranthakan.</p>

<p>          Dear Friends,</p>
<p>          Pls recall details of the Udayarkudi incriptions<br />      posted in the Photo<br />          Section (due to paucity of storing space in the<br />      Files Section.)</p>
<p>          A Retd Dy Suptt of Police (DSP)Sri RAMARAJ from<br />      CBI, who was in the<br />          team that investigated Late PM Rajiv Gandhi's<br />      murder, has been<br />          concentrating on Aditha Karikalan's murder for<br />      the past 3 - 4 years.<br />          Now settled in Chennai, he has contacted Dr.<br />      Kalaikkovan (who did<br />          mention this when I spoke last week) &amp; Dr.<br />      Kudavoil. He had gone<br />          through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions<br />      and opined. He has<br />          been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we<br />      met and spent some<br />          time on this subject.</p>
<p>          FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review<br />      this subject from the<br />          angle of investigating agency which has<br />      specialised in Poltical<br />          assassinations. Secondly such person has already<br />      invested 3 -4<br />          years of hard work in going into several<br />      inscriptions, write ups,<br />          books and other sources apart from personal<br />      interviews with<br />          acknowledged Scholars on this subject.</p>
<p>          With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the<br />      Udayarkudi<br />          inscriptions and certain details evolved :</p>
<p>          1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji's murder<br />      &amp; AK's murder.<br />          2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD.<br />          Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both<br />      / other reasons..?<br />          How : ??<br />          WHO :: ??<br />          3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light<br />      on the above ..<br />          reviewed..<br />          4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..</p>
<p>          Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the<br />      insctiptions a decade<br />          back, personally I have been maintaining that<br />      UTHAMA has a hand in<br />          the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has<br />      been disturbing me.</p>
<p>          This gentleman made me to look at this from<br />      another angle::</p>
<p>          The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja's<br />      SAFETY till he<br />          ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the<br />      mechanism to wipe of<br />          RRC if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He<br />      could not be Drohin.</p>
<p>          Kudavoil has been maintaining that the<br />      CONFISCATION OF LANDS took<br />          place during Uthama's tenure..</p>
<p>          If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes<br />      under cloud..</p>
<p>          Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under<br />      Sundara or Uthama?<br />          Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule<br />      in Pandya Kingdom?</p>
<p>          But when certain matters were subjected under<br />      scrutiny, the opinion<br />          is still swinging ..</p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Think of another conspiracy theory of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  being able to control Uthama chola for 16 long years(an extra-constitutional power eg. sonia).. then one day he gets tired of all this non-sense.. fine let me be the consitution itself.. ;)</p>
<p>just kidding.. another line of thought.. </p>
<p>Also as SPS or someone else had pointed out, humans tend to believe what they want to believe.. eg... we have been so fantasised by the greatness of colas that we refuse to believe that have always been part of the land and our cultures for thousands of years... </p>
<p>Mind you, we all have been swayed by the literary exposition of KALKI.. NO doubt that we will refuse to believe anything and everything that would go against the path of growth identified in the Ponniyen selvan..</p>
<p>mughals had always had brothers fighting brothers.. except in some cases in the hindu kingdoms.. eldest always ruled.. </p>
<p>Sandilyan did build a part of the core of his story for Kadal puraa aournd Kulothungan's exile from his own kingdom(chalukya cholas from eastern chalukya or vengi)..</p>
<p>Also <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  storyline has something similar to the way in which first kulothungan came to power in the chola country.. </p>

<p>if <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is the culprit as per your view, why should he wait for 12 years to come to the power, why should he allow UTHAMA CHOLAN to be in power for 12 years ? For the one who killed the bravest AK, will it be a matter to Kill UTHAMA CHOLAN ?</p>
<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  got the idea of building the Big temple for Lord Shiva after he saw the huge Butha Vihars in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>So please don't defame his glory by your baseles views.</p>

<p>Seriously though, why isn't this feasible? Surely <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was an ambitious person... his willingness to use force to expand his state's territory is a sure sign of that. Most successful, ambitious people are ruthless to a certain degree. So why can't the scenario that I dished out be true? His having built the Periya Kovil can be thought of as atonement for his "sin" of killing his own brother :-D </p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Inorder to check whether <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  killed his own brother,<br />we need to read the previous Tamil history and whether<br />any previous king has done the same thing. To my<br />knowledge, there is no proof that any other Tamil king<br />had done this before. </acronym></p>
<p>If <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had murdered his own brother, he might have<br />easily eliminated Utama &amp; co and become the king in<br />first place.</acronym></p>
<p>Let us remove that option from our minds.</p>
<p>When Aditya Karikalan was killed, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  wouldnt even<br />have known it as he was too young... </acronym></p>
<p>We need to trace what <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was doing during those 16<br />years of Utama chola rule. Was he imprissoned or<br />deputed to other districts ?</acronym></p>
<p>Was Sundara Chola alive when Aditya was killed ? If so<br />why didnt he find the culprits ? Was he aware that his<br />son was killed by the "drohins" ?</p>
<p>How did Aditya die ? Was he poisoned or his head<br />severed?</p>
<p>Sundara Chola was not the decendent person to claim<br />the throne. So inorder to eliminate Aditya to become<br />the king, Utama or his associates might have conspired<br />the murder.</p>
<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's waiting for 16 years might have been the natural<br />choice. Probably he had known the fact, but no<br />authority to punish the criminals. Or probably he knew<br />only after becoming the king...</acronym></p>
<p>Why there was lots of peace during the 16 year Utama<br />rule? If he was so meek, the neighbouring countries<br />would have plunged against the chola kingdom!</p>
<p>Let us think more!</p>

<blockquote><p>  dear Mr SPS;   Dont u think a 16 or 18 year old can plot and kill<br />  his own brother? I think<br />  this is possible. Wasn't RRC younger than 18 when he<br />  fought battles in<br />  Lanka? I think RRC was mature enough at 16-18 and<br />  certainly had the mental<br />  and physical capabilities to carry out such a<br />  scheme.<br />  We are still not able solve a murder which happened<br />  1000 ears ago. There<br />  have been generations who have been trying to solve<br />  this mystery and i doubt<br />  whether we ever will.<br />  Of all the people who had probably killed AK who was<br />  the person who had<br />  skill to do it and hide for 1000years and more! RRC!<br />  He even has the least<br />  amount of people suspecting him!Killing brothers at<br />  18 for the kingdom was<br />  probably not that big a deal then.<br />  I am sure some novelist will write a book on this<br />  and the debate would<br />  become even more controversial.</p>

<p>    Dear Arun,</p>
<p>    RRC was speculated and a book did spring on this a<br />  decade ago. Dr.<br />    Kalaikovan also quoted. The speculation was<br />  thrashed on several facts.</p>
<p>    Let us look at basic ground realities :</p>
<p>    1. 969 AD Aditha Karikalan was murdered.<br />    2. RRC came to throne in 985 AD. Ended his 30 yrs<br />  rule 1014.<br />    RjC co-ruled 2 yrs from 1012 AD to 1014 AD.<br />    3. Uthama 16 yr is 985. 969 Ascended.<br />    4. When was RRC born? 951 or so is my assumption.<br />  CBI DSP places 953.<br />    Means he ascended when he was 34 / 32 and quit 64<br />  /62. No mention<br />    beyond 1014. Assume he passed away.<br />    5. Uthama was married and visited with his Queen<br />  Meenavan madevi<br />    (Pandya Qn) Nageswaram Temple &amp; Thiruvottiyur -<br />  Sundara Chozha period<br />    insciptions. Means he was grown up in 969 when<br />  ascended.<br />    6. RRC should have been 18 or 16 when AK murdered.</p>
<p>    Do you mean to say that a 18 or 16 yr old boy<br />  plotted to kill his<br />    elder brother to ascend throne after another 16<br />  years ?</p>
<p>    Did he not revolt against Uthama ? Pls read<br />  Thiruvalangadu copper<br />    plates.</p>
<p>    Uthama would have wiped off RRC had RRC Murdered<br />  his Own brother.</p>
<p>    Okay.. This does give us opportunity to discuss<br />  and set aside such<br />    speculations. sps</p>

So can we assume that there was a <br />premediated arrangement between Uthama and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ? If so.... the <br />conspiracy theory against Karikala within the Chola family gets <br />stronger.....<br />==================<br />Dear Sir, </acronym></p>
<p>Thanks for your Attention.</p>
<p>These queries DID figure in the Discussions.  <br />We will discuss more in detail in due course.</p>
<p>Since members are showing enormous interest (obviously), let us help <br />them identifying the REAL CHARACTERS and FICTITIOUS ones..<br />Nandhini - Mandakini - Alwarkadiyan .. Manimegalai .. Fictitious.</p>
<p>Kandamaran need to be assumed as a rep of Kurunila mannar. <br />Sambuvarayars are traced only in the 11th Century Historically.</p>
<p>The <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Story takes place in the year 969 AD (10th Century).</p>
<p>Parthibendran - there is Copper plate talking of him. Even Sastry <br />is not able to IDENTIFY who he is.. speculations are made ..</p>
<p>Anirudh(PM of Sundara) - <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  - Kundavai - Arumozhi - Veerapandiyan - <br />Periya Pazhuvettarayar :: Real. Chinna P - Unreal.<br />Vaanathi Real. She is Mother of Rajendra. But Patta Mahishi of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  <br />is OLAGA MADEVI @ Danthi Sakthi Vidangi.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Uthama is normally hailed as "Sembiyan madevi thiruvayirudhitha <br />Uthama Chozha thevar ..". Dr. Kalaikkovan observed that Rajendra is <br />also notified similarly after his mother's name in Thiruvalanchuzhi <br />inscriptions. Pls Read Valachuzhi Vaanar by Dr. Kkvn.</p>
<p>Dear Friends, Please pour your views .. </p>
<p>Our Group will definitely make some progress in solving this mystry <br />over a period of time.</p>

<prpoornimasai@...  wrote:</p>
<p>Aditha Karikalan murder is undoubtedly a contraversial topic - that is <br />why even today it is discussed in length.</p>
<p>There have been several school of thoughts :</p>
<p>1. <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastry suspected Uthama's hand in the Cholas; 2. Sadasiva Pandrathar did not. (Incidentally he hails from <br />Tiruperumbuyam ! - recall <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym )<br />3. Kudanthai Sethuraman has discussed in length in his book "Early <br />Cholas" AK's murder in the Chapter "The Judgement" and absolved; 4. Contemporary Historians of repute like Dr. Kalaikkovan has agreed <br />to take up these inscriptions for study. Please find time to go into <br />the details of the Articles written by Dr. Kalaikkovan and Dr. Nalini <br />in <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a> to know of UNADULTERED TRUE History.<br />5. Dr. Kudavoil Balasubramanian of Saraswathi Mahal has taken up study <br />and put a paper "Udayarkudi Kalvettukkal" - Oru Meell Paarvai - which <br />I put in the Photo Section - which is the base paper for discussion.<br />6. Apart from them, Dr. Nagaswamy - Who was Director of Tamilnadu <br />State Archeology during MGR's period - is considered to be the <br />Authority (<a href="http://www.tamilarts" title="www.tamilarts">www.tamilarts</a> academy.com - I think) in <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  because of him <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Big temple details are brought out so gloriously in the past <br />25 years.<br />7. Vikaraman - who wrote sequel to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  - as Nandhi Purathu Nayaki and <br />Vandhiyathevan Vaall - was introduced to our Group by respected Member <br />Seethalakshmi Madam. <br />8. Magic Lantern - the Group which enacted Ponniyinselvan drama - is <br />introduced to our Group (Dr. Kalaikovan's siters son Elango Directed)- <br />by respected member Seethalakshmi Madam.<br />9. Apart from the above, our Group is directly interacting with <br />Archelogical Survey of India - Chennai / Thanjai / Kerala and has <br />access to Tamilnadu Archelogy Department also; 10. Our Group has been interacting (pls refer Musiri mail also) with <br />living Legends like Dr. Subbarayalu of Thanjai Tamil University. Dr. <br />Thiagarajan of Ariyalur Arts College History Deptt HOD (Who found <br />evidence of Dyno in Aryalur - between Chidambaram / Trichy) Dr. Akila <br />and our Group interacted with Great Personalities like Airavatham Dr. <br />mahadevan on Tamil Brahmi. Recently Dr. Dasarathan (Libis ) Media <br />Person TKV Rajan attended the meets of our Group.<br />11. Fiction Writers like Mr. Balakumaran (Udayar / Kadigai) has also <br />been consulted by our Group.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>All these details - records of discussions / visits etc., are there in <br />the Archieves of our Group.</p>
<p>Outright, the entire echoleon stated above, has rejected the postulate <br />involving <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  with AKs murder.</p>
<p>The DSP / <acronym title="Central Bureau of Investigation" CBI</acronym  (Retd) has definitely visited most of the Schools of <br />thoughts and is agreeable to discuss in our Group his methodologies.</acronym></p>
<p>Re Micro discussions, we can split everything into various TOPICs - <br />Search what is already reported from our Archieves and add whatever <br />is our opinion when need be.</p>
<p>We can also organise a Seminar with this TOPIC as a point of interest.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I had compared DaVinci code to this situation because both tend shake common<br />beliefs, the scale of the controversy (although the DaVinci controversy is<br />much greater),both if proved right would tear to pieces all that was<br />believed uptil now. And both have been shunned by historians.<br />I really think a good book on this subject written as a fast paced novel<br />and not as a historical account will bring more publicity to the Chola<br />dynasty. Dont get me wrong but i think the "DaVinci" code has done more to<br />Christianity in terms of publicity than any other mercenary. I really feel<br />that DaVinci code is the biggest publicity stunt by the Church or some other<br />organisation.<br />I also have another question why choose such a bloody way to finish off AK?<br />If Nandini had planned it then i feel she would have poisoned him or because<br /><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym is almost lifeless near her she could have talked him into killing<br />himself or something like that? Mind you this one incredibly<br />beautiful,talented and evil lady we are talking about here. Has this been<br />already discussed? Pardon my ignorance but i really feel the murder could<br />have been carried out better. Or has it been made this bloody by our Kalki?<br />I think we are all looking at these episodes through Kalki unintentionally<br />or intentionally.</acronym></p>

<p>  wl check and tell you the author.</p>
<p>  Remember these things :</p>
<p>  In 969, prior to murder Aditha Karikalan was in power in Kanchi.</p>
<p>  Sundara was already in power in Thanjai.</p>
<p>  Uthama married - well connected politically.</p>
<p>  Sembian Madevi - who became omnipotent - 969 - 1000 was alive.</p>
<p>  Undere these conditions, RRC (&amp; Kundavai) against AK .. to give<br />  Power to Uthama ?!</p>

        <p>We may not know what happened 1000 years back. Only speculate....<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  relinquishing the throne for Uthama and coming back after 16 years is the confusing factor here.<br />If <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  can remove Karikalan to assume power, why did he wait for 16 years with Uthama on the throne. He need not have sacrifised the throne in the first place.</p>
<p>At the same time why didnt Uthama's son was not made the king after him. Why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  who made a great sacrifice earlier changed his mind after 16 years, eventhough that period was peaceful without any major attacks on the kingodm. So can we assume that there was a premediated arrangement between Uthama and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ? If so.... the conspiracy theory against Karikala within the Chola family gets stronger.....</p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Arun @ Aditya Karikalan, <br />( Sound pretty Good!!!).</p>
<p>if <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is the culprit as per your view, why should he wait for 12 years to come to the power, why should he allow UTHAMA CHOLAN to be in power for 12 years ? For the one who killed the bravest AK, will it be a matter to Kill UTHAMA CHOLAN ?</p>
<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  got the idea of building the Big temple for Lord Shiva after he saw the huge Butha Vihars in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>So please don't defame his glory by your baseles views.</p>
<p>Regards, <br />Joseph.</p>

<p>Seriously though, why isn't this feasible? Surely <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was an ambitious person... his willingness to use force to expand his state's territory is a sure sign of that. Most successful, ambitious people are ruthless to a certain degree. So why can't the scenario that I dished out be true? His having built the Periya Kovil can be thought of as atonement for his "sin" of killing his own brother :-D </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>    Hi Sps</p>
<p>    thats fantastic..</p>
<p>    now we can also be happy the the old cases of<br />  history are being<br />    solved.<br />    the national geographic did such an investigation<br />  ( including ct scan<br />    of the body) of tutankhamen of egyp who was also<br />  possibly murdered.</p>
<p>    I am very happy uthama was absolved. we have had<br />  similar discussions<br />    in the past and many members have said that uthama<br />  could have easily<br />    wiped out rrc with an accidental death.<br />    but my reasons are purely literary and partisan.<br />    kalki was not keen to pin it on senthan amuthan or<br />  mathuranthakan.</p>
<p>    but first of all I would request you to explain to<br />  us where udayarkudi<br />    is , and in what circumstances the kalvettu was<br />  discovered.</p>

<p>      Dear Friends,</p>
<p>      Pls recall details of the Udayarkudi incriptions<br />  posted in the Photo<br />      Section (due to paucity of storing space in the<br />  Files Section.)</p>
<p>      A Retd Dy Suptt of Police (DSP)Sri RAMARAJ from<br />  CBI, who was in the<br />      team that investigated Late PM Rajiv Gandhi's<br />  murder, has been<br />      concentrating on Aditha Karikalan's murder for<br />  the past 3 - 4 years.<br />      Now settled in Chennai, he has contacted Dr.<br />  Kalaikkovan (who did<br />      mention this when I spoke last week) &amp; Dr.<br />  Kudavoil. He had gone<br />      through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions<br />  and opined. He has<br />      been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we<br />  met and spent some<br />      time on this subject.</p>
<p>      FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review<br />  this subject from the<br />      angle of investigating agency which has<br />  specialised in Poltical<br />      assassinations. Secondly such person has already<br />  invested 3 -4<br />      years of hard work in going into several<br />  inscriptions, write ups,<br />      books and other sources apart from personal<br />  interviews with<br />      acknowledged Scholars on this subject.</p>
<p>      With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the<br />  Udayarkudi<br />      inscriptions and certain details evolved :</p>
<p>      1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji's murder<br />  &amp; AK's murder.<br />      2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD.<br />      Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both<br />  / other reasons..?<br />      How : ??<br />      WHO :: ??<br />      3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light<br />  on the above ..<br />      reviewed..<br />      4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..</p>
<p>      Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the<br />  insctiptions a decade<br />      back, personally I have been maintaining that<br />  UTHAMA has a hand in<br />      the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has<br />  been disturbing me.</p>
<p>      This gentleman made me to look at this from<br />  another angle::</p>
<p>      The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja's<br />  SAFETY till he<br />      ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the<br />  mechanism to wipe of<br />      RRC if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He<br />  could not be Drohin.</p>
<p>      Kudavoil has been maintaining that the<br />  CONFISCATION OF LANDS took<br />      place during Uthama's tenure..</p>
<p>      If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes<br />  under cloud..</p>
<p>      Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under<br />  Sundara or Uthama?<br />      Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule<br />  in Pandya Kingdom?</p>
<p>      But when certain matters were subjected under<br />  scrutiny, the opinion<br />      is still swinging ..</p>
<p>      It was an interesting experience to talk to him.<br />  I have agreed to<br />      provide certain materials for his expert review.</p>
<p>      Will report more in due course. sps</p>

        <p>Dear SPS, </p>
<p>Why isn't it possible? Why not? Can anybody tell for sure? </p>
<p>tracing down the hierarchy to present day Sophia .. !?</p>
<p>Teacher turning to be the hunter guy ... No logics..</p>
<p>It is a story, yes and it must have its part of fiction else this would have turned into a religious war. Passing judgements like 'no logic' etc. without basing your comments is not appropriate. </p>
<p>Leaving Da Vinci aside.. </p>
<p>Could you tell me if any of these copper plates bear any similarities with incidents in Ponniyin Selvan? I mean it looks like Kalki has used fictious characters. I was shocked to find that Nandini is an imaginary person. Is that true? </p>
<p>And like some of us said about AK's murder, why not <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ? If not <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , I would bet it on Kundavai. Because she herself was a very ambitious person and she had wanted to rule thro' <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  , according to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . </p>
<p>Assuming that Kalki had at least portrayed the characters as they were..<br />we can safely say Kundavai had a sharp political intellect and that she was capable of induling in conspiracies!</p>
<p>Let me know your views.</p>
<p>Also, would love to read any material you may have on the inscriptions . I have also seen that the Tiruvalengadu copper plates have been mentioned in numerous places. What is the significance of these? </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Poornima. </p>

<p>  PLS READ THIRUVALANGADU COPPER PLATES VERSION.</p>
<p>  Wasn't RRC younger than 18 when he fought battles in<br />  Lanka? I think RRC was mature enough at 16-18 and certainly had the<br />  mental and physical capabilities to carry out such a scheme.</p>
<p>  And after 16 years of killing his own brother, RRC made a REGNL<br />  ORDER to Udayarkudi Sabai idetifying Ravidasan &amp; co are Drohins and<br />  lands confiscated?</p>
<p>  Uthama knew this, but did not react ?</p>
<p>  And after 18 years, RRC takes kandalurchalai ?</p>
<p>  There have to be answers to such queries ..</p>
<p>  The equation was simple : If RRC did it, he should have gained<br />  control forth with, as otherwise he would have been murdered !</p>
<p>  KUNDAVAI &amp; VANDIYATHEVAN WERE ALL PARTY THIS, YET DID NOT ENJOY ANY<br />  BENEFITS FOR 16 YEARS ?!</p>
<p>  No one will take a chance not to SACRIFICE Power for 16 long years -<br />  DURING WHICH PERIOD there was NO MENTION OF ARUMOZHI, KUNDAVAI OR<br />  VANDHIYATHEVAN !</p>
<p>  We are still not able solve a murder which happened 1000 ears ago.<br />  There have been generations who have been trying to solve this<br />  mystery and i doubt whether we ever will.</p>
<p>  Of all the people who had probably killed AK who was the person who<br />  had skill to do it and hide for 1000years and more! RRC! He even has<br />  the least amount of people suspecting him!Killing brothers at 18 for<br />  the kingdom was probably not that big a deal then.</p>
<p>  I am sure some novelist will write a book on this and the debate<br />  would become even more controversial.<br />  ====================================<br />  SUCH BOOK DID SURFACE AND WAS CRITICISED BY HISTORIANS.<br />  =================================<br />    Regards<br />    Rahul</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>As I mentioned, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  + Kundavai could have done it. True <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was only 18ish..<br />but then we ought to take into account that he was already a battle hardened<br />veteran by then. Also, the more I think about Kundavai, the more I get the<br />feeling that this was one tough lady. Perhaps she was the brains behind it?<br />Think about it.. in those days (why even in these days) when the "kal<br />aanaalum kanavan" mantra used to rule a woman, how could she remain behind<br />in her piranthaveedu and not go to her husband's house? <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had enough wives<br />to take care of Rajendra Chozhan. I would suspect that Kundavai was the<br />brains behind the murder. <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was probably too headstrong and independent for<br />Kundavai to control while <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , who probably adored her was more pliant :-)</p>

<p>  Dear Arun,</p>
<p>  RRC was speculated and a book did spring on this a decade ago. Dr.<br />  Kalaikovan also quoted. The speculation was thrashed on several facts.</p>
<p>  Let us look at basic ground realities :</p>
<p>  1. 969 AD Aditha Karikalan was murdered.<br />  2. RRC came to throne in 985 AD. Ended his 30 yrs rule 1014.<br />  RjC co-ruled 2 yrs from 1012 AD to 1014 AD.<br />  3. Uthama 16 yr is 985. 969 Ascended.<br />  4. When was RRC born? 951 or so is my assumption. CBI DSP places 953.<br />  Means he ascended when he was 34 / 32 and quit 64 /62. No mention<br />  beyond 1014. Assume he passed away.<br />  5. Uthama was married and visited with his Queen Meenavan madevi<br />  (Pandya Qn) Nageswaram Temple &amp; Thiruvottiyur - Sundara Chozha period<br />  insciptions. Means he was grown up in 969 when ascended.<br />  6. RRC should have been 18 or 16 when AK murdered.</p>
<p>  Do you mean to say that a 18 or 16 yr old boy plotted to kill his<br />  elder brother to ascend throne after another 16 years ?</p>
<p>  Did he not revolt against Uthama ? Pls read Thiruvalangadu copper<br />  plates.</p>
<p>  Uthama would have wiped off RRC had RRC Murdered his Own brother.</p>
<p>  Okay.. This does give us opportunity to discuss and set aside such<br />  speculations. sps</p>

<p>  RRC was speculated and a book did spring on this a decade ago.  <br />Dr. <br />  Kalaikovan also quoted. The speculation was thrashed on several <br />facts.</p>
<p>  Let us look at basic ground realities :</p>

Uthama 16 yr is 985. 969 Ascended.<br />  4. When was RRC born? 951 or so is my assumption. CBI DSP places <br />953. <br />  Means he ascended when he was 34 / 32 and quit 64 /62. No mention <br />  beyond 1014. Assume he passed away.<br />  5. Uthama was married and visited with his Queen Meenavan madevi <br />  (Pandya Qn) Nageswaram Temple &amp; Thiruvottiyur - Sundara Chozha <br />period <br />  insciptions. Means he was grown up in 969 when ascended.<br />  6. RRC should have been 18 or 16 when AK murdered.</p>
<p>  Do you mean to say that a 18 or 16 yr old boy plotted to kill his <br />  elder brother to ascend throne after another 16 years ?  </p>
<p>  Did he not revolt against Uthama ? Pls read Thiruvalangadu copper <br />  plates.</p>
<p>  Uthama would have wiped off RRC had RRC Murdered his Own brother.</p>
<p>  Okay.. This does give us opportunity to discuss and set aside such <br />  speculations. sps</p>

        <p>dear Mr SPS; Dont u think a 16 or 18 year old can plot and kill his own brother? I think<br />this is possible. Wasn't <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  younger than 18 when he fought battles in<br />Lanka? I think <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was mature enough at 16-18 and certainly had the mental<br />and physical capabilities to carry out such a scheme.<br />We are still not able solve a murder which happened 1000 ears ago. There<br />have been generations who have been trying to solve this mystery and i doubt<br />whether we ever will.<br />Of all the people who had probably killed <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym who was the person who had<br />skill to do it and hide for 1000years and more! <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ! He even has the least<br />amount of people suspecting him!Killing brothers at 18 for the kingdom was<br />probably not that big a deal then.<br />I am sure some novelist will write a book on this and the debate would<br />become even more controversial.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>haha... maybe I should use Aditya Karikalan as my punaip peyar!:-D</p>
<p>Seriously though, why isn't this feasible? Surely <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was an ambitious<br />person... his willingness to use force to expand his state's territory is a<br />sure sign of that. Most successful, ambitious people are ruthless to a<br />certain degree. So why can't the scenario that I dished out be true? His<br />having built the Periya Kovil can be thought of as atonement for his "sin"<br />of killing his own brother :-D</acronym></p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

What if<br />    his and Kundavai's overarching ambitions led to his<br />    hiring some goons to<br />    kill AK?

<p>      now we can also be happy the the old cases of<br />    history are being<br />      solved.<br />      the national geographic did such an investigation<br />    ( including ct scan<br />      of the body) of tutankhamen of egyp who was also<br />    possibly murdered.</p>
<p>      I am very happy uthama was absolved. we have had<br />    similar discussions<br />      in the past and many members have said that uthama<br />    could have easily<br />      wiped out rrc with an accidental death.<br />      but my reasons are purely literary and partisan.<br />      kalki was not keen to pin it on senthan amuthan or<br />    mathuranthakan.</p>
<p>      but first of all I would request you to explain to<br />    us where udayarkudi<br />      is , and in what circumstances the kalvettu was<br />    discovered.</p>

<p>        Dear Friends,</p>
<p>        Pls recall details of the Udayarkudi incriptions<br />    posted in the Photo<br />        Section (due to paucity of storing space in the<br />    Files Section.)</p>
<p>        A Retd Dy Suptt of Police (DSP)Sri RAMARAJ from<br />    CBI, who was in the<br />        team that investigated Late PM Rajiv Gandhi's<br />    murder, has been<br />        concentrating on Aditha Karikalan's murder for<br />    the past 3 - 4 years.<br />        Now settled in Chennai, he has contacted Dr.<br />    Kalaikkovan (who did<br />        mention this when I spoke last week) &amp; Dr.<br />    Kudavoil. He had gone<br />        through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions<br />    and opined. He has<br />        been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we<br />    met and spent some<br />        time on this subject.</p>
<p>        FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review<br />    this subject from the<br />        angle of investigating agency which has<br />    specialised in Poltical<br />        assassinations. Secondly such person has already<br />    invested 3 -4<br />        years of hard work in going into several<br />    inscriptions, write ups,<br />        books and other sources apart from personal<br />    interviews with<br />        acknowledged Scholars on this subject.</p>
<p>        With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the<br />    Udayarkudi<br />        inscriptions and certain details evolved :</p>
<p>        1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji's murder<br />    &amp; AK's murder.<br />        2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD.<br />        Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both<br />    / other reasons..?<br />        How : ??<br />        WHO :: ??<br />        3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light<br />    on the above ..<br />        reviewed..<br />        4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..</p>
<p>        Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the<br />    insctiptions a decade<br />        back, personally I have been maintaining that<br />    UTHAMA has a hand in<br />        the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has<br />    been disturbing me.</p>
<p>        This gentleman made me to look at this from<br />    another angle::</p>
<p>        The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja's<br />    SAFETY till he<br />        ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the<br />    mechanism to wipe of<br />        RRC if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He<br />    could not be Drohin.</p>
<p>        Kudavoil has been maintaining that the<br />    CONFISCATION OF LANDS took<br />        place during Uthama's tenure..</p>
<p>        If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes<br />    under cloud..</p>
<p>        Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under<br />    Sundara or Uthama?<br />        Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule<br />    in Pandya Kingdom?</p>
<p>        But when certain matters were subjected under<br />    scrutiny, the opinion<br />        is still swinging ..</p>
<p>        It was an interesting experience to talk to him.<br />    I have agreed to<br />        provide certain materials for his expert review.</p>
<p>        Will report more in due course. sps</p>

<p>    A Retd Dy Suptt of Police (DSP)Sri RAMARAJ from CBI, who was in the<br />    team that investigated Late PM Rajiv Gandhi's murder, has been<br />    concentrating on Aditha Karikalan's murder for the past 3 - 4 years.<br />    Now settled in Chennai, he has contacted Dr. Kalaikkovan (who did<br />    mention this when I spoke last week) &amp; Dr. Kudavoil. He had gone<br />    through the details of Udayarkudi inscriptions and opined. He has<br />    been referred to me by Dr. Kudavoil and today we met and spent some<br />    time on this subject.</p>
<p>    FIRST OF ALL, it is very apporpriate to review this subject from the<br />    angle of investigating agency which has specialised in Poltical<br />    assassinations. Secondly such person has already invested 3 -4<br />    years of hard work in going into several inscriptions, write ups,<br />    books and other sources apart from personal interviews with<br />    acknowledged Scholars on this subject.</p>
<p>    With such rich back-ground he has reviewed the Udayarkudi<br />    inscriptions and certain details evolved :</p>
<p>    1. Striking parallelism between Rajivji's murder &amp; AK's murder.<br />    2. Murder took place When :: 969 AD.<br />    Why: To Avenge / to clear Throne rivalry / Both / other reasons..?<br />    How : ??<br />    WHO :: ??<br />    3. Do Udayarkudi inscriptions throw enough light on the above ..<br />    reviewed..<br />    4. What are the postulates ..to identify WHO ..</p>
<p>    Here I must CONFESS that ever since I saw the insctiptions a decade<br />    back, personally I have been maintaining that UTHAMA has a hand in<br />    the assassination of AK. The word "Drohin" has been disturbing me.</p>
<p>    This gentleman made me to look at this from another angle::</p>
<p>    The PRIORITY of UTHAMA was to ENSURE Rajaraja's SAFETY till he<br />    ascended the THRONE in 985 AD. Uthama had the mechanism to wipe of<br />    RRC if he wanted during Uthamas tenure ... He could not be Drohin.</p>
<p>    Kudavoil has been maintaining that the CONFISCATION OF LANDS took<br />    place during Uthama's tenure..</p>
<p>    If yes, then Uthama is absolved. If no, he comes under cloud..</p>
<p>    Was Ravidasan, made a Brahmadirajan under Sundara or Uthama?<br />    Was Panchavan Brahmadirayan during Chozha rule in Pandya Kingdom?</p>
<p>    But when certain matters were subjected under scrutiny, the opinion<br />    is still swinging ..</p>
<p>    It was an interesting experience to talk to him. I have agreed to<br />    provide certain materials for his expert review.</p>
<p>    Will report more in due course. sps</p></sps10142004@...></p>

          REVIEW OF UDAYARKUDI INSCRIPTIONS :: AK&#039;s MURDER        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Sps</p>
<p>thats fantastic..</p>
<p>now we can also be happy the the old cases of history are being <br />solved.<br />the national geographic did such an investigation ( including ct scan <br />of the body) of tutankhamen of egyp who was also possibly murdered.</p>
<p>I am very happy uthama was absolved. we have had similar discussions <br />in the past and many members have said that uthama could have easily <br />wiped out <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  with an accidental death.<br />but my reasons are purely literary and partisan.<br />kalki was not keen to pin it on senthan amuthan or mathuranthakan.</acronym></p>
<p>but first of all I would request you to explain to us where udayarkudi <br />is , and in what circumstances the kalvettu was discovered.</p>
<p>regards<br />venketesh</p>
