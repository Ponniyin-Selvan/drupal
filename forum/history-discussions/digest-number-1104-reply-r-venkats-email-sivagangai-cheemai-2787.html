<p>  Dear Sri</p>
<p>  some info I gathered on kattabomman- the man</p>
<p>  Paanchalankurichi is a hamlet 18 kms from Thoothukkudi. It was here<br />  that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi was born on<br />  January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and Aarmugathammal.<br />  The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who was a minister<br />  in King Jagaveera Pandian's durbar in Azhagiya Veerapandiapuram, as<br />  Ottapidaram of today was known as.<br />  Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated from the<br />  Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and was a fearless<br />  warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died issueless, Bommu<br />  ascended the throne.<br />  Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on February 7, 1790,<br />  and ruled for 9 years<br />  The TN Government has propagated the memory of Kattabomman by<br />  erecting (in 1974) a memorial fort in his honour in<br />  Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the hereditary Goddess<br />  of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.</p>
<p>  To observe the bicentenary on 16th October 1999 of Kattabomman's<br />  hanging, the Central Government brought out a postal stamp in his<br />  honour.</p>
<p>  there are seven living direct descendents of the Kattabomman<br />  family.The Government pays each of them a monthly pension of Rs. 500,</p>
<p>  Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the nine Nava<br />  Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt between Thirunelveli<br />  and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple witnessed the<br />  battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and the British,<br />  where the British used this temple as a fortress. Battle marks are<br />  seen on the temple's door.</p>

<p>It was KAvi Yogi Shuddhananda Bharathi, the brother of my Materanl<br />grandfather who gave Kannadaasan the history of Marudhu Pandiyars. Kavi Yogi<br />has written about Marudhu Pandiyar and also a drama about ``Veera Velu<br />Naachiyar'', who was also a queen in likes of Rani Lakshmi of Jhansi. Her<br />statue is still seen in front of Sivagangai Palace. Also, my maternal<br />grandfather Shri J Rengasamy Iyer, who was the tutor to the then King Durai<br />Singam Raja and his son Shanmuga Raja, possessed a family tree shaped like a<br />Banyan Tree, which explained all the Marudhu Pandiyar, Velu NAchiyar -<br />route. This was also given to Kannadasan, for which he I doubt didnt pay any<br />amount!! True, Sivagangai Seemai was much more authentic but sadly a box<br />office failure.<br />Regards<br />J Chandrasekaran</p>

<p>  Dear Sri</p>
<p>  kattabomman the movie and sivagangai seemai</p>
<p>  the film kattabomman was not without its share of controversies.<br />  Denouncing the glorification of Kattabomman, Thamizhvaanan<br />  wrote "kattabomman telungan! koLLaikkaran! avanukku munbE pulithEvan<br />  engiRa veera maRavan pOraadinaan!"<br />  Kannadasan claimed that the Maruthu brothers were the true sons of<br />  the soil who raised their voice against the British. And to bolster<br />  his claim, he set about making the movie `sivagangai seemai'.<br />  veerapaNdiya kattabomman was released on May 6, 1959, and sivagangai<br />  seemai was released on May 19, 1959.<br />  Kannadasan Productions' Sivagangai Seemai- 1959 was Kannadasan's<br />  labour of love, He wrote the script & lyrics; and produced the film.<br />  It was his second venture in the wake of the success of Maalaiyitta<br />  Mangai the previous year. Sivagangai Seemai was directed by<br />  K.Shankar, and had a talented star cast led by T.K.Bagavathi, SSR,<br />  P.S.Veerappa, S.Varalakshmi, Kumari Kamala, M.N.Rajam and others.<br />  Unfortunately for Kannadasan, Sivagangai Seemai was consigned back<br />  to the cans within no time of its release while the successful<br />  Veerapandiya Kattabomman was acclaimed as a magnum opus. Kannadasan<br />  ended up with a huge financial loss.<br />  Sivagangai Seemai still remains among the best historical films made<br />  in Tamil. Kannadasan's native soil was the canvas, and he was<br />  familiar with its history and geography. He had a keen sense of the<br />  period, and his passion ensured that Sivagangai Seemai was much more<br />  than a commonplace costume drama.</p>

<p>  I am from Sivagangai. My grandfather, who had tutored<br />  3 generations of the Rajas of Sivagangai was the<br />  source of information for Kannadasan. I have heard<br />  from my grandmother that whenever Kannadasan came to<br />  our house to learn and discuss historical matters with<br />  him, the womenfolk of the house and street used to<br />  sort of go away, as he was a "nasthik" at that time<br />  and used to write on women in a not so dignified way..<br />  at that time. So, many people told my thatha not to<br />  co-operate with him, as he may not put the things in<br />  the right perspective. Still, my thatha liked working<br />  with him, understanding his genuine feeling for<br />  Marudhu Pandiyar and they had worked together for days<br />  on.</p>
<p>  Of course, no acknowledgement was made anywhere in the<br />  movie for all the help rendered is another thing which<br />  we Indians are used to.</p>
<p>  In fact, Kaviyogi Maharshi Suddhanandha Bharathi had<br />  written a full-fledged drama on Marudhu Sahodharargal,<br />  which is full of actual facts dramatised very well.</p>
<p>  The present family members of Sivaganga Samasthanam<br />  are associated with Suddhananda Bharathiyar's school<br />  at Cholapuram, near Sivagangai.</p>

<p>  Panchalankurichi is visited mostly by school children<br />  where they can see paintings ( recent) depicting life<br />  of Kattabomman. There is a watchman who takes you<br />  around the painting repeating what is written there in<br />  Tamil and asks you for money at the end of the trip.</p>
<p>  Just outside, there is temple of Jakkamma and ruins of<br />  the palace of Kattabomman. One interesting thing about<br />  the place is, there is a spot which is very cool even<br />  in the hot afternoon of May ( when we were there).<br />  This is open to sky, but the stone is very cool. You<br />  can feel it with your bare foot. The next stone is<br />  very hot. This one is absolutely chill.....</p>
<p>  A person who claimed that he is descendent of<br />  Kattabomman ( he had the relevant document issued by<br />  Govt.) tells you stories of Kattabomman and told us<br />  about this stone which was part of the Andhapuram,<br />  which was sort of air-coolled. This guy has got a lot<br />  of rare issues of history based books which God knows<br />  he procured from where.</p>
<p>  Sad part is, at the end of the discussion, he<br />  literally begs you for money. You are left with a<br />  mixed feeling of .............</p>

<p>  Dear uma<br />  the present sivaganga royal family has not descended from the maruthu<br />  brothers. their descendants live in an area called aranmanai<br />  siruvayal.<br />  they are still honoured on the ther thiruvizha of kalayar koil every<br />  may month</p>
<p>  kattabomman had no great conquest except occasional raids into<br />  ettayapuram zamin<br />  whereas maruthu sakotharakal even held madurai for some time.</p>
<p>  but all said and done kattabomman was a brave warrior who defended<br />  his rights against an alien.<br />  and ettayapuram which was reportedly responsible for his death<br />  repented in a great way??????<br />  know what????</p>
<p>  subramania bharathi was born there.</p>

<p>  I remember reading a book by tamilvanan called as 'Kattabomman<br />  kollaikaran'.</p>
<p>  In that book late tamilvanan says that kattabomman wasnt a hero.The<br />  movie showed him as a revolutionary leader but whereas in reality he<br />  was running after banerman requesting him to postpone tax payments<br />  says tamilvanan.</p>
<p>  The fall of kattabomman was a result of his infighting with<br />  ettayapuram maharaja it seems.</p>
<p>  Was kattabomman popular before the movie came?Or was he raised to cult<br />  status because of the movie?was he a real freedom fighter or a local<br />  king who lost the game with ettayapuram raja?</p>
<p>  I find it difficult to accept pre 1857 kings as freedom fighters.They<br />  never had any dreams of indian indpendence.They wanted to rule their<br />  province independently and dint give a damn when other indian kings<br />  were attacked.Tippu opposed british when they attacked him but kept<br />  quiet when marathas and other kings were defeated by british.</p>
<p>  British were very much an indian kingdom then.Other kings saw them as<br />  another indian kingdom and frequently entered into agreements and<br />  friendships with them.Those who fought with british were later on<br />  raised to cult status.</p>
<p>  In reality no king thought beyond his samasthanam.1857 was first<br />  attempt to chase away british from whole of india.</p>

<p>    Paanchalankurichi is a hamlet 18 kms from Thoothukkudi. It was here<br />    that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi was born on<br />    January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and Aarmugathammal.<br />    The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who was a minister<br />    in King Jagaveera Pandian's durbar in Azhagiya Veerapandiapuram, as<br />    Ottapidaram of today was known as.<br />    Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated from the<br />    Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and was a fearless<br />    warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died issueless, Bommu<br />    ascended the throne.<br />    Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on February 7, 1790,<br />    and ruled for 9 years<br />    The TN Government has propagated the memory of Kattabomman by<br />    erecting (in 1974) a memorial fort in his honour in<br />    Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the hereditary Goddess<br />    of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.</p>

<p>    there are seven living direct descendents of the Kattabomman<br />    family.The Government pays each of them a monthly pension of Rs. 500,</p>

<p>  We went to Ettayapuram thinking that we would get to<br />  see Bharathiyar's house in all its glory ( I dont mean<br />  richness..... I mean well preserved, respected and<br />  valued). Unfortunately, the guy who is supposed to<br />  come and open did not come beyond the appointed time.<br />  We made 3 repeated trips on the same day, but still it<br />  was not open. Compare this with the way Shakespeare's<br />  house is treated in England!!</p>
<p>  Why are we like this??? The neighbour of this great<br />  house, where a man like Bharathiyar lived, does not<br />  want to even open his house to answer our questions.<br />  He is happy watching a stupid serial in Sun TV when a<br />  group of us want some information from him as to the<br />  timings of the place... this house has been taken over<br />  by Govt and it employs a man to show it around. Still,<br />  this is the condition!</p>
<p>  Yes, I know Sivagangai Samasthanam has no connection<br />  with Marudhu Pandiyar. But they had access to a lot of<br />  valuable historical data which they did not really<br />  value! Their tutor had read almost all of them and<br />  knew more about Marudhu Pandyas!!</p>

<p>  sampaththukku oru salaaam</p>
<p>  he has hit the nail on its head</p>
<p>  we as students of history should realise there was no entity called<br />  india till just before the british left.<br />  and the indianness started with 1857.</p>
<p>  kattabomman and maruthu pandyar were feudatories of the arcot nawab a<br />  remnant of the mughal empire. when arcot transferred its powers to<br />  the british rose these problems.</p>
<p>  i distinctly remember having read that kattabomman visited fort st<br />  george as a valued guest of the british a few years before he turned<br />  rebel.</p>
<p>    Was kattabomman popular before the movie came?Or was he raised to<br />  cult<br />    status because of the movie?was he a real freedom fighter or a local<br />    king who lost the game with ettayapuram raja?</p>
<p>  kattabomman and the ettappaa business must be after independence when<br />  we were hunting for heroes.</p>
<p>  perhaps Bharathiyar would never have been in the employ of the<br />  ettayapuram if he had beleived it had betrayed kattabomman.(????)</p>

<p>  another reason could be</p>
<p>  The war in RR period has started with Pandiyas, needless to say, Pandiyas<br />  were the main enemy , But Uttama had a pandiya Queen , may be an arrangement<br />  to avoid the war an about Cheera also Uttama might have had the Link through<br />  with Ravidasan &amp; Co, basically because of this , Uttama didn't had great<br />  enemies to fight and even he may not be interested to expand the Kingdom.</p>

<p>  Cholas to chase the aliens out of thamil soil...come to the rescue of<br />  Kulasegara and send his regiments under Pallavarayar(s) and they do defeat<br />  the Lankan commanders and hang their head on the madurai fort...</p>
