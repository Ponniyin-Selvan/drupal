</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I came across an Article in Rediff.com which I thought is worth <br />sharing. Earlier, in one of the mails, Priya said, "Satish had a <br />torrential downpore of feelings". Its not just feelings and my words <br />are facts. All of us take it lightly saying that its just feelings <br />and not facts. Hope this article will substantiate my point.</p>
<p>Its almost a week, since Benny Hinn left India, but the scars he left <br />in the Hindus heart can never be healed. He commented that Idol <br />worship is equalant to Prostitution and such a person is strongly <br />supported by the congress govt. both at the center and the state. <br />When press reporters asked the coordination team of the event, no one <br />was able to answer any of the questions and they left out with their <br />faces red. But no media published it except "Indian Express" and this <br />weeks Thuqlaq. Such is the "secular" attitute of our media people.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, only if all Indians stay united, we can win over <br />the so called Secularist governments. Read the article below.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>
<p>Article from Rediff.com<br />=======================</p>
<p>Secularism Zindabad!!!!</p>
<p>January 27, 2005</p>
<p>Secularism Zindabad!!! Secularism Zindabad!!! Secularism Zindabad!!!<br />Wonder, why this sloganeering? Well, why not? We are after all the <br />proud citizens of our great country and we should once in a while <br />remind ourselves that our country was founded on the basic principles <br />of secularism. <br />So please join me in saying it aloud: 'Secularism Zindabad.'<br />Now that we are done with the sloganeering, let us get back to the <br />ground and the realities therein.<br />Where is secularism heading towards in this great country of ours? Do <br />we really practice the concept of secularism that our Constitution <br />refers to? <br />The Preamble of our Constitution starts as:<br />'We, The People of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute <br />India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic and to <br />secure to all its citizens:<br />JUSTICE, social, economic and political; <br />LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; <br />EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; <br />and to promote among them all <br />FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and <br />integrity of the Nation...'<br />So, does the government make every effort to uphold this Constitution <br />in letter and spirit? Does it make sure that its policies are driven <br />to maintain the secular fabric of India? Unfortunately, not.<br />What have we, the citizens of India, done to make sure that <br />secularism stays and flourishes in India? Sadly, very little! <br />What has the media -- the fourth estate -- done to make sure that <br />every citizen of this country, irrespective of his/her religion gets <br />a fair deal? Inexcusably, nothing.<br />If the government, the citizenry and the fourth estate are not doing <br />anything to secure the secular fabric of our great country, where <br />does that leave us and our future generations?<br />We have experienced numerous examples of horrendous governmental <br />policies that go against the basic tenet of secularism. Secularism <br />means 'the view that religious considerations should be excluded from <br />civil affairs or public education.' It also means 'a doctrine that <br />rejects religion and religious considerations.'<br />But how many times have we really seen it being actually practiced in <br />the policies of this or the past governments?<br />One latest example of the United Progressive Alliance government's <br />anti-secular policies has been the decision by the human resources <br />development ministry to remove S K Pandey and M K Kaw from their <br />respective posts of director and chairman of the Srinagar-based <br />National Institute of Technology.<br />Since this latest move by the UPA government is related to the domain <br />of Kashmir, it is very detrimental to the secular basis of our <br />country and thus the national security of India. This act of <br />replacing these two top officers of the institute, without <br />justifiable reasons, demonstrates the continuing appeasement policy <br />of the UPA government towards the majority community in Kashmir. By <br />taking this shocking decision, the UPA government has once again <br />succumbed to the diktats of the majority community in Kashmir and <br />confirmed that it cannot appoint any member of the minority community <br />to the top posts of such prestigious institutes. <br />In a country that is constitutionally based on the concept of <br />secularism, such decisions based on racial considerations are nothing <br />but violation of the law. One only needs to read the letters <br />published in recent editions of the vernacular press in Kashmir to <br />see the venomous attitude of majority community members towards one <br />of these two officers from the minority community. This definitely is <br />another way of ethnic cleansing of the minority community in the <br />valley, the recent wave of which started in Kashmir way back in 1989.<br />By succumbing to the blackmail tactics of the majority community in <br />Kashmir, the government is setting a very dangerous precedent in the <br />Kashmir valley. If this policy of appeasement continues to be the <br />fundamental policy of this government, it is only a matter of time <br />before every appointment to central governmental posts in Kashmir <br />will have to be ratified by its majority community chieftains. <br />In light of such policies being practiced by the government, what <br />should the mainstream media's role and responsibility be? <br />The mainstream media needs to wake up and be real about secularism. <br />It has been so far practicing pseudo-secularism and that is a death <br />knell for our country. It needs to live up to its own <br />responsibilities as a watchdog. We have plentiful examples where the <br />mainstream media has played havoc with the concept of secularism. It <br />has most often taken the side of the minority communities at the cost <br />of the interest of the majority community, all based on its <br />convenience. <br />I am not against any community per se. But in my opinion, the <br />mainstream media's job is to be fair and balanced and cover each <br />community equally and fight for each community's interests <br />irrespective of its size and religion. Wouldn't that be being truly <br />secular in principle, letter and spirit?<br />What should the role and responsibility of an Indian citizen be? <br />We, the citizens, always whine about the unjust policies of <br />governments. But is that whining enough to bring about a change, a <br />positive change? Does this whining absolve us of our <br />responsibilities? <br />NO. Simply, NO. <br />We, the citizens, need to engage in meaningful protests as well as <br />education of our elected representatives. We all should protest <br />against such high-handed policies of governments that are <br />unconstitutional and are against the national security interests of <br />our country. <br />We, the citizens, should write/speak to our elected representatives <br />and express our disgust and anger over any such policy that is unjust <br />and puts our national interests at risk. <br />We, the citizens, the electorate, need to make it very clear to our <br />elected representatives that their job is in our hands and if we are <br />not happy with their performance they will be without a job after the <br />next election. Every election has to be their performance appraisal. <br />Only then will these politicians learn and listen to us. We all need <br />to be the watch-dogs for our own national security and survival.<br />So, my fellow citizens, would you please stand up against each and <br />every anti-secular policy of this and all future governments? Would <br />you please watch your elected representatives (all the way from a <br />panchayat in a village to the national Parliament in Delhi) and their <br />actions and how those actions affect the survival of our great <br />country? <br />Would you please watch the media organisations and patronise only <br />those that work for the welfare of our great country? <br />Would you please realise your responsibility towards our great <br />country and deliver? <br />Would you, please?<br />It is now or never.<br />Lalit Koul is the publisher and editor of Kashmir Herald <br />(<http://www.kashmirherald.com/ ) and can be reached at <br /><a href="mailto:editor@kashmirherald.com">editor@kashmirherald.com</a> <mailto:editor@kashmirherald.com </p>

        <p>Satish,</p>
<p>First let me condemn that statement by Benny Hinn in the strongest <br />words possible.That is atrocious to say the least.</p>
<p>Anyway I am surprised that he gave such a statement.Because in most <br />of the christian churches they do Idol worship, in velankanni they <br />even carry the idol of mary in a charriot.In most of the churches in <br />vatican and even in Tamilnadu I have seen idols of jesus in cross <br />and as a baby in hands of mary etc.In most of the houses in usa I <br />have seen idol of jesus in cross and people kneeling and praying <br />before it.</p>
<p>This is what vatican says about Idol worship.</p>
<p>tradition whereby images of our Lord, His holy mother, and of the <br />saints are displayed in churches for the veneration of the faithful?<br />this practice of placing sacred images in churches so that they can <br />be venerated by the faithful is to be maintained. (Vatican II)</p>
<p>"The images of Christ and the Virgin Mother of God, and of the other <br />saints, are to be had and to be kept, especially in Churches, and <br />due honor and veneration are to be given them." Council of Trent, <br />25th sess. (1563).</p>
<p>From:http://www.letusreason.org/RC2.htm.</p>
<p>In most of the churches not only idols of mary,jesus but also those <br />of apostles and saints are kept.So who is benny hinn complaining <br />against?</p>
<p>Hindu religion has all forms of worship.Worshiping a formless god<br />(chidambaram), worshiping god as parents, gurus, husband and idol <br />form.Many saints have meditated on the formless bhramman.</p>
<p>I dont think hinduism stresses any form of worship as the best.It <br />accepts worshiping God in any form idol or no idol.Making that <br />difference is meaningless.When I pray before an idol I only see god <br />in that form .I dont see an idol.But it will be difficult for the <br />likes of benny hinn to understand such a powerful concept.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi all,</p>
<p>  I came across an Article in Rediff.com which I thought is worth <br />  sharing. Earlier, in one of the mails, Priya said, "Satish had a <br />  torrential downpore of feelings". Its not just feelings and my <br />words <br />  are facts. All of us take it lightly saying that its just feelings <br />  and not facts. Hope this article will substantiate my point.</p>
<p>  Its almost a week, since Benny Hinn left India, but the scars he <br />left <br />  in the Hindus heart can never be healed. He commented that Idol <br />  worship is equalant to Prostitution and such a person is strongly <br />  supported by the congress govt. both at the center and the state. <br />  When press reporters asked the coordination team of the event, no <br />one <br />  was able to answer any of the questions and they left out with <br />their <br />  faces red. But no media published it except "Indian Express" and <br />this <br />  weeks Thuqlaq. Such is the "secular" attitute of our media people.</p>
<p>  As I said earlier, only if all Indians stay united, we can win <br />over <br />  the so called Secularist governments. Read the article below.</p>

<p>  Secularism Zindabad!!!!</p>
<p>  January 27, 2005</p>
<p>  Secularism Zindabad!!! Secularism Zindabad!!! Secularism <br />Zindabad!!!<br />  Wonder, why this sloganeering? Well, why not? We are after all the <br />  proud citizens of our great country and we should once in a while <br />  remind ourselves that our country was founded on the basic <br />principles <br />  of secularism. <br />  So please join me in saying it aloud: 'Secularism Zindabad.'<br />  Now that we are done with the sloganeering, let us get back to the <br />  ground and the realities therein.<br />  Where is secularism heading towards in this great country of ours? <br />Do <br />  we really practice the concept of secularism that our Constitution <br />  refers to? <br />  The Preamble of our Constitution starts as:<br />  'We, The People of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute <br />  India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic and <br />to <br />  secure to all its citizens:<br />  JUSTICE, social, economic and political; <br />  LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; <br />  EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; <br />  and to promote among them all <br />  FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity <br />and <br />  integrity of the Nation...'<br />  So, does the government make every effort to uphold this <br />Constitution <br />  in letter and spirit? Does it make sure that its policies are <br />driven <br />  to maintain the secular fabric of India? Unfortunately, not.<br />  What have we, the citizens of India, done to make sure that <br />  secularism stays and flourishes in India? Sadly, very little! <br />  What has the media -- the fourth estate -- done to make sure that <br />  every citizen of this country, irrespective of his/her religion <br />gets <br />  a fair deal? Inexcusably, nothing.<br />  If the government, the citizenry and the fourth estate are not <br />doing <br />  anything to secure the secular fabric of our great country, where <br />  does that leave us and our future generations?<br />  We have experienced numerous examples of horrendous governmental <br />  policies that go against the basic tenet of secularism. Secularism <br />  means 'the view that religious considerations should be excluded <br />from <br />  civil affairs or public education.' It also means 'a doctrine that <br />  rejects religion and religious considerations.'<br />  But how many times have we really seen it being actually practiced <br />in <br />  the policies of this or the past governments?<br />  One latest example of the United Progressive Alliance government's <br />  anti-secular policies has been the decision by the human resources <br />  development ministry to remove S K Pandey and M K Kaw from their <br />  respective posts of director and chairman of the Srinagar-based <br />  National Institute of Technology.<br />  Since this latest move by the UPA government is related to the <br />domain <br />  of Kashmir, it is very detrimental to the secular basis of our <br />  country and thus the national security of India. This act of <br />  replacing these two top officers of the institute, without <br />  justifiable reasons, demonstrates the continuing appeasement <br />policy <br />  of the UPA government towards the majority community in Kashmir. <br />By <br />  taking this shocking decision, the UPA government has once again <br />  succumbed to the diktats of the majority community in Kashmir and <br />  confirmed that it cannot appoint any member of the minority <br />community <br />  to the top posts of such prestigious institutes. <br />  In a country that is constitutionally based on the concept of <br />  secularism, such decisions based on racial considerations are <br />nothing <br />  but violation of the law. One only needs to read the letters <br />  published in recent editions of the vernacular press in Kashmir to <br />  see the venomous attitude of majority community members towards <br />one <br />  of these two officers from the minority community. This definitely <br />is <br />  another way of ethnic cleansing of the minority community in the <br />  valley, the recent wave of which started in Kashmir way back in <br />1989.<br />  By succumbing to the blackmail tactics of the majority community <br />in <br />  Kashmir, the government is setting a very dangerous precedent in <br />the <br />  Kashmir valley. If this policy of appeasement continues to be the <br />  fundamental policy of this government, it is only a matter of time <br />  before every appointment to central governmental posts in Kashmir <br />  will have to be ratified by its majority community chieftains. <br />  In light of such policies being practiced by the government, what <br />  should the mainstream media's role and responsibility be? <br />  The mainstream media needs to wake up and be real about <br />secularism. <br />  It has been so far practicing pseudo-secularism and that is a <br />death <br />  knell for our country. It needs to live up to its own <br />  responsibilities as a watchdog. We have plentiful examples where <br />the <br />  mainstream media has played havoc with the concept of secularism. <br />It <br />  has most often taken the side of the minority communities at the <br />cost <br />  of the interest of the majority community, all based on its <br />  convenience. <br />  I am not against any community per se. But in my opinion, the <br />  mainstream media's job is to be fair and balanced and cover each <br />  community equally and fight for each community's interests <br />  irrespective of its size and religion. Wouldn't that be being <br />truly <br />  secular in principle, letter and spirit?<br />  What should the role and responsibility of an Indian citizen be? <br />  We, the citizens, always whine about the unjust policies of <br />  governments. But is that whining enough to bring about a change, a <br />  positive change? Does this whining absolve us of our <br />  responsibilities? <br />  NO. Simply, NO. <br />  We, the citizens, need to engage in meaningful protests as well as <br />  education of our elected representatives. We all should protest <br />  against such high-handed policies of governments that are <br />  unconstitutional and are against the national security interests <br />of <br />  our country. <br />  We, the citizens, should write/speak to our elected <br />representatives <br />  and express our disgust and anger over any such policy that is <br />unjust <br />  and puts our national interests at risk. <br />  We, the citizens, the electorate, need to make it very clear to <br />our <br />  elected representatives that their job is in our hands and if we <br />are <br />  not happy with their performance they will be without a job after <br />the <br />  next election. Every election has to be their performance <br />appraisal. <br />  Only then will these politicians learn and listen to us. We all <br />need <br />  to be the watch-dogs for our own national security and survival.<br />  So, my fellow citizens, would you please stand up against each and <br />  every anti-secular policy of this and all future governments? <br />Would <br />  you please watch your elected representatives (all the way from a <br />  panchayat in a village to the national Parliament in Delhi) and <br />their <br />  actions and how those actions affect the survival of our great <br />  country? <br />  Would you please watch the media organisations and patronise only <br />  those that work for the welfare of our great country? <br />  Would you please realise your responsibility towards our great <br />  country and deliver? <br />  Would you, please?<br />  It is now or never.<br />  Lalit Koul is the publisher and editor of Kashmir Herald <br />  (<http://www.kashmirherald.com/ ) and can be reached at <br />  editor@k... <mailto:editor@k... </p></mailto:editor@k...></http://www.kashmirherald.com/></p></blockquote>
