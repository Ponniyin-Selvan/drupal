</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I read this speech and bowed in the direction in which this great <br />man lives.Had this man born before 3000 years he would have been <br />hailed as a saint/prophet.See the patriotism and self confidence <br />that flows from his heart.See how he blends India's history with its <br />future.</p>
<p>regards<br />sampath<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />SPEECH DELIVERED IN HYDERABAD:</p>
<p>"I have three visions for India. </p>
<p>In 3000 years of our history, people from all over the world have <br />Alexander onwards. The Greeks, the Turks, the Moguls, the <br />Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and <br />looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any <br />other nation. We have not conquered anyone. </p>
<p>We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and <br />tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because we respect <br />the freedom of others. That is why my first vision is that of <br />FREEDOM. I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, <br />when we started the war of independence. It is this freedom that we <br />must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one <br />will respect us. </p>
<p>My second vision for India is DEVELOPMENT. For fifty years we have <br />been a developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed <br />nation. </p>
<p>We are among top 5 nations of the world in terms of GDP We have 10 <br />percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. <br />Our achievements are being globally recognized today. Yet we lack <br />the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed<br />nation, self- reliant and self-assured. Isn't this incorrect? </p>
<p>I have a THIRD vision. </p>
<p>India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that, unless <br />India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength <br />respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power <br />but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand. My good <br />fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr. Vikram <br />Sarabhai of the Dept. of space, Professor Satish Dhawan, who <br />succeeded him and Dr.Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear material. I <br />was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider <br />this the great opportunity of my life. </p>
<p>I see four milestones in my career: </p>
<p>Twenty years I spent in <acronym title="Indian Space Research Organisation" ISRO</acronym . I was given the opportunity to be the <br />project director for India's first satellite launch vehicle, SLV3. <br />The one that launched Rohini. These years played a very important <br />role in my life of Scientist. </acronym></p>
<p>After my <acronym title="Indian Space Research Organisation" ISRO</acronym  years, I joined <acronym title="Defence Research &amp; Development Organisation" DRDO</acronym  and got a chance to be the part <br />of India's guided missile program. It was my second bliss when Agni <br />met its mission requirements in 1994. </acronym></p>
<p>The Dept. of Atomic Energy and <acronym title="Defence Research &amp; Development Organisation" DRDO</acronym  had this tremendous partnership <br />in the recent nuclear tests, on May 11 and 13. This was the third <br />bliss. The joy of participating with my team in these nuclear tests <br />and proving to the world that India can make it, that we are no <br />longer a developing nation but one of them. It made me feel very <br />proud as an Indian. The fact that we have now developed for Agni a <br />re-entry structure, for which we have developed this new material. A <br />Very light material called carbon-carbon. </acronym></p>
<p>One day an orthopedic surgeon from Nizam Institute of Medical <br />Sciences visited my laboratory. He lifted the material and found it <br />so light that he took me to his hospital and showed me his patients. <br />There were these little girls and boys with heavy metallic calipers <br />weighing over three Kg. each, dragging their feet around. </p>
<p>He said to me: Please remove the pain of my patients. </p>
<p>In three weeks, we made these Floor reaction Orthosis 300-gram <br />calipers and took them to the orthopedic center. The children didn't <br />legs, they could now move around! </p>
<p>Their parents had tears in their eyes. That was my fourth bliss! </p>
<p>Why is the media here so negative? Why are we in India so <br />embarrassed to recognize our own strengths, our achievements? We are <br />such a great nation. We have so many amazing success stories but we <br />refuse to acknowledge them. </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>We are the first in milk production. <br />We are number one in Remote sensing satellites. <br />We are the second largest producer of wheat. <br />We are the second largest producer of rice. <br />Look at Dr. Sudarshan, he has transferred the tribal village into a <br />self-sustaining, self driving unit. There are millions of such <br />achievements but our media is only obsessed in the bad news and <br />failures and disasters. </p>
<p>I was in Tel Aviv once and I was reading the Israeli newspaper. It <br />was the day after a lot of attacks and bombardments and deaths had <br />taken place. The Hamas had struck. But the front page of the <br />newspaper had the picture of a Jewish gentleman who in five years <br />had transformed his desert land into an orchid and a granary. It was <br />this inspiring picture that everyone woke up to. The gory details of <br />killings, bombardments, deaths, were inside in the newspaper, buried <br />among other news. </p>
<p>In India we only read about death, sickness, terrorism, crime. Why <br />are we so NEGATIVE? </p>
<p>Another question : Why are we, as a nation so obsessed with foreign <br />things? </p>
<p>We want foreign TVs, we want foreign shirts. We want foreign <br />technology. Why this obsession with everything imported. Do we not <br />realize that self-respect comes with self-reliance? </p>
<p>I was in Hyderabad giving this lecture, when a 14 year old girl <br />asked me for my autograph. I asked her what her goal in life is. </p>
<p>She replied: I want to live in a developed India. </p>
<p>For her, you and I will have to build this developed India. You must <br />proclaim. India is not an under-developed nation; it is a highly <br />developed nation. </p>
<p>Do you have 10 minutes? Allow me to come back with a vengeance. </p>
<p>Got 10 minutes for your country? If yes, then read; otherwise, <br />choice is yours. </p>
<p>YOU say that our government is inefficient. <br />YOU say that our laws are too old. <br />YOU say that the municipality does not pick up the garbage. <br />YOU say that the phones don' t work, the railways are a joke, the <br />airline is the worst in the world, mails never reach their <br />destination. <br />YOU say that our country has been fed to the dogs and is the <br />absolute pits. <br />YOU say, say and say. </p>
<p>What do YOU do about it? Take a person on his way to Singapore..... <br />Give him a name - YOURS. Give him a face - YOURS. YOU walk out of <br />the airport and you are at your International best. In Singapore you <br />don't throw cigarette butts on the roads or eat in the stores. YOU <br />are as proud of their Underground links as they are. You pay $5 <br />(approx. Rs.60) to drive through Orchard Road (equivalent of Mahim <br />Causeway or Pedder Road) between 5 PM and 8 PM. YOU comeback to the <br />parking lot to punch your parking ticket if you have over stayed in <br />a restaurant or a shopping mall irrespective of your status <br />identity. In Singapore you don't say anything, DO YOU? YOU wouldn't <br />dare to eat in public during Ramadan, in Dubai. YOU would not dare <br />to go out without your head covered in Jeddah. YOU would not dare to <br />buy an employee of the telephone exchange in London at 10 pounds <br />(Rs.650) a month to, "see to it that my STD and ISD calls are billed <br />to someone else." YOU would not dare to speed beyond 55 mph (88 <br />km/h) in Washington and then tell the traffic cop, "Jaanta hai main <br />kaun hoon (Do you know who I am?). I am so and so's son. Take your <br />two bucks and get lost." </p>
<p>YOU wouldn't chuck an empty coconut shell anywhere other than the <br />garbage pail on the beaches in Australia and New Zealand. </p>
<p>Why don't YOU spit Paan on the streets of Tokyo? <br />Why don't YOU use examination jockeys or buy fake certificates in <br />Boston??? <br />We are still talking of the same YOU. <br />YOU who can respect and conform to a foreign system in other <br />countries but cannot in your own. <br />You who will throw papers and cigarettes on the road the moment you <br />touch Indian ground. If you can be an involved and appreciative <br />citizen in an alien country, why cannot you be the same here in <br />India? </p>
<p>Once in an interview, the famous Ex-municipal commis sioner of <br />Bombay, Mr.Tinaikar, had a point to make. "Rich people's dogs are <br />walked on the streets to leave their affluent droppings all over the <br />place," he said. "And then the same people turn around to criticize <br />and blame the authorities for inefficiency and dirty pavements. What <br />do they expect the officers to do? Go down with a broom every time <br />their dog feels the pressure in his bowels? </p>
<p>In America every dog owner has to clean up after his pet has done <br />the job. Same in Japan. Will the Indian citizen do that here?" He's <br />right. </p>
<p>We go to the polls to choose a government and after that forfeit all <br />responsibility. We sit back wanting to be pampered and expect the <br />government to do everything for us whilst our contribution is <br />totally negative. We expect the government to clean up but we are <br />not going to stop chucking garbage all over the place nor are we <br />going to stop to pick a up a stray piece of paper and throw it in <br />the bin. We expect the railways to provide clean bathrooms but we <br />are not going to learn the proper use of bathrooms. </p>
<p>We want Indian Airlines and <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym India to provide the best of food <br />and toiletries but we are not going to stop pilfering at the least <br />opportunity. This applies even to the staff who is known not to pass <br />on the service to the public. When it comes to burning social issues <br />like those related to women, dowry, girl child and others, we make <br />loud drawing room protestations and continue to do the reverse at <br />home. Our excuse? "It's the whole system which has to change, how <br />will it matter if I alone forego my sons' rights to a dowry." So <br />who's going to change the system? </acronym></p>
<p>What does a system consist of? Very conveniently for us it consists <br />of our neighbors, other households, other cities, other communities <br />and the government. But definitely not me and YOU. When it comes to <br />us actually making a positive contribution to the system we lock <br />ourselves along with our families into a safe cocoon and look into <br />the distance at countries far away and wait for a Mr. Clean to come <br />along &amp; work miracles for us with a majestic sweep of his hand or we <br />leave the country and run away.</p>
<p>Like lazy cowards hounded by our fears we run to America to bask in <br />their glory and praise their system. When New York becomes insecure <br />we run to England. When England experiences unemployment, we take <br />the next flight out to the Gulf. When the Gulf is war struck, we <br />demand to be rescued and brought home by the Indian government. <br />Everybody is out to abuse and rape the country. Nobody thinks of <br />feeding the system. Our conscience is mortgaged to money. </p>
<p>Dear Indians, The article is highly thought inductive, calls for a <br />great deal of introspection and pricks one's conscience too....I am <br />echoing J.F.Kennedy's words to his fellow Americans to relate to <br />Indians..... </p>
<p>"ASK WHAT WE CAN DO FOR INDIA AND DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO MAKE <br />INDIA WHAT AMERICA AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE TODAY" </p>
<p>Lets do what India needs from us. </p>
<p>Thank you, <br />Dr. Abdul Kalaam <br />(PRESIDENT OF INDIA) </p>

<p>    One of the things I learned in my 7 years in US is<br />    that these things <br />    need to be taught from childhood. Since my son was<br />    born and brought <br />    up in US for 3 years, he understands now that he<br />    should be throwing <br />    things around in roads and should be putting it in<br />    trash cans and he <br />    follows that also. Its just a habit for him and<br />    probably he dont <br />    realize that he is doing a good thing. My only worry<br />    is that <br />    our 'education' should not make him lose this habit.<br />    So my <br />    suggestion is to teach the kids from a early stage<br />    and it will at <br />    least make sure that we bring up a generation that<br />    is different from <br />    the current one(and older ones) and eventually leads<br />    to a better <br />    India for all.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>our education was one of the excellent ... but all degradation started becoz of our unquestioning acceptance of a system brought out by "Lord macaulay"... thinkers in those era were so obsessed with western thoughts that they accepted whatever the british said...</p>
<p>yes macaulay system had its own merits.. it helped in the spread of education.... but on the flip side we started losing our values....</p>
<p>That is why Swami Vivekananda said.."Education must be man Making ".... So let us reinvent our education system....</p>

          Blending India&#039;s history with its futu APJ Abdul Kalam        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>A group of 5-6 people in our ex-company had taken vow not to throw away<br />garbage waste paper on the roads, spit / urinate in the streets and we have<br />been following that for quite a few years now. But it doesn't create much<br />attention in my home. When I tell my sister / mother not to throw away a<br />paper on the road, they simply don't budge. How do we educate such people??<br />-----Original Message-----<br />From: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />[mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com]On Behalf Of Muruganandam<br />Sent: Wednesday, August 10, 2005 5:39 PM<br />To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />Subject: RE: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Blending India's history with its<br />future: APJ Abdul Kalam</p>
