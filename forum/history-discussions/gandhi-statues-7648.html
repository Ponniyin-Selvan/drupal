        <p>Our member muruganandam has done a complete book on GANDHIYAI SUTTA PIN</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Yuva <yuvarajam@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hi All,</p>
<p>  I would like to share the below article with you all, as we could understand<br />  what Godse's felt about Gandhiji.</p>
<p>  Gandhiji Assassin Nathuram Godse's Final Address to the Court </p>
<p>  Nathuram Godse was arrested immediately after he assassinated Gandhiji,<br />  based on a F. I. R. filed by Nandlal Mehta at the Tughlak Road Police staton<br />  at Delhi. The trial, which was held in camera, began on 27th May 1948 and<br />  concluded on 10th February 1949. He was sentenced to death.. An appeal to<br />  the Punjab High Court, then in session at Simla, did not find favour and the<br />  sentence was upheld. </p>
<p>  The statement that you are about to read is the last made by Godse before<br />  the Court on the 5th of May 1949. Such was the power and eloquence of this<br />  statement that one of the judges, G. D. Khosla, later wrote, "I have,<br />  however, no doudt that had the audience of that day been constituted intoa<br />  jury and entrusted with the task of deciding Godse's appeal, they would have<br />  brought a verdict of 'not Guilty' by an overwhelming majority" </p>
<p>  WHY I KILLED GANDHI </p>
<p>  Born in a devotional Brahmin family, I instinctively came to revere Hindu<br />  religion, Hindu history and Hindu culture. I had, therefore, been intensely<br />  proud of Hinduism as a whole. As I grew up I developed a tendency to free<br />  thinking unfettered by any superstitious allegiance to any isms, political<br />  or religious. That is why I worked actively for the eradication of<br />  untouchability and the caste system based on birth alone. I openly joined<br />  anti-caste movements and maintained that all Hindus were of equal status as<br />  to rights, social and religious and should be considered high or low on<br />  merit alone and not through the accident of birth in a particular caste or<br />  profession. I used publicly to take part in organized anti-caste dinners in<br />  which thousands of Hindus, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Chamars and<br />  Bhangis participated. We broke the caste rules and dined in the company of<br />  each other. I have read the speeches and writings of Dadabhai Naoroji,<br />  Vivekanand, Gokhale, Tilak, along with the books of ancient and modern<br />  history of India and some prominent countries like England, France, America<br />  and Russia. Moreover I studied the tenets of Socialism and Marxism. But<br />  above all I studied very closely whatever Veer Savarkar and Gandhiji had<br />  written and spoken, as to my mind these two ideologies have contributed more<br />  to the moulding of the thought and action of the Indian people during the<br />  last thirty years or so, than any other single factor has done. </p>
<p>  All this reading and thinking led me to believe it was my first duty to<br />  serve Hindudom and Hindus both as a patriot and as a world citizen. To<br />  secure the freedom and to safeguard the just interests of some thirty crores<br />  (300 million) of Hindus would automatically constitute the freedom and the<br />  well-being of all India, one fifth of human race. This conviction led me<br />  naturally to devote myself to the Hindu Sanghtanist ideology and programme,<br />  which alone, I came to believe, could win and preserve the national<br />  independence of Hindustan, my Motherland, and enable her to render true<br />  service to humanity as well. </p>
<p>  Since the year 1920, that is, after the demise of Lokamanya Tilak,<br />  Gandhiji's influence in the Congress first increased and then became<br />  supreme. His activities for public awakening were phenomenal in their<br />  intensity and were reinforced by the slogan of truth and non-violence which<br />  he paraded ostentatiously before the country. No sensible or enlightened<br />  person could object to those slogans. In fact there is nothing new or<br />  original in them. They are implicit in every constitutional public movement.<br />  But it is nothing but a mere dream if you imagine that the bulk of mankind<br />  is, or can ever become, capable of scrupulous adherence to these lofty<br />  principles in its normal life from day to day. </p>
<p>  In fact, honour, duty and love of one's own kith and kin and country might<br />  often compel us to disregard non-violence and to use force. I could never<br />  conceive that an armed resistance to an aggression is unjust. I would<br />  consider it a religious and moral duty to resist and, if possible, to<br />  overpower such an enemy by use of force. [In the Ramayana] Rama killed<br />  Ravana in a tumultuous fight and relieved Sita.. [In the Mahabharata],<br />  Krishna killed Kansa to end his wickedness; and Arjuna had to fight and slay<br />  quite a number of his friends and relations including the revered Bhishma<br />  because the latter was on the side of the aggressor. It is my firm belief<br />  that in dubbing Rama, Krishna and Arjuna as guilty of violence, the Mahatma<br />  betrayed a total ignorance of the springs of human action. In more recent<br />  history, it was the heroic fight put up by Chhatrapati Shivaji that first<br />  checked and eventually destroyed the Muslim tyranny in India. It was<br />  absolutely essentially for Shivaji to overpower and kill an aggressive Afzal<br />  Khan, failing which he would have lost his own life. In condemning history's<br />  towering warriors like Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind Singh as<br />  misguided patriots, Gandhiji has merely exposed his self-conceit. He was,<br />  paradoxical as it may appear, a violent pacifist who brought untold<br />  calamities on the country in the name of truth and non-violence, while Rana<br />  Pratap, Shivaji and the Guru will remain enshrined in the hearts of their<br />  countrymen for ever for the freedom they brought to them. </p>
<p>  The accumulating provocation of thirty-two years, culminating in his last<br />  pro-Muslim fast, at last goaded me to the conclusion that the existence of<br />  Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately. Gandhi had done very goodin<br />  South Africa to uphold the rights and well-being of the Indian community<br />  there. But when he finally returned to India he developed a subjective<br />  mentality under which he alone was to be the final judge of what was right<br />  or wrong. If the country wanted his leadership, it had to accept his<br />  infallibility; if it did not, he would stand aloof from the Congress and<br />  carry on his own way. Against such an attitude there can be no halfway<br />  house. Either Congress had to surrender its will to his and had to be<br />  content with playing second fiddle to all his eccentricity, whimsicality,<br />  metaphysics and primitive vision, or it had to carry on without him. He<br />  alone was the Judge of everyone and every thing; he was the master brain<br />  guiding the civil disobedience movement; no other could know the technique<br />  of that movement. He alone knew when to begin and when to withdraw it. The<br />  movement might succeed or fail, it might bring untold disaster and political<br />  reverses but that could make no difference to the Mahatma's infallibility.<br />  'A Satyagrahi can never fail' was his formula for declaring his own<br />  infallibility and nobody except himself knew what a Satyagrahi is. Thus, the<br />  Mahatma became the judge and jury in his own cause. These childish<br />  insanities and obstinacies, coupled with a most severe austerity of life,<br />  ceaseless work and lofty character made Gandhi formidable and irresistible.<br />  Many people thought that his politics were irrational but they had eitherto<br />  withdraw from the Congress or place their intelligence at his feet to do<br />  with as he liked. In a position of such absolute irresponsibility Gandhi was<br />  guilty of blunder after blunder, failure after failure, disaster after<br />  disaster. Gandhi's pro-Muslim policy is blatantly in his perverse attitude<br />  on the question of the national language of India. It is quite obvious that<br />  Hindi has the most prior claim to be accepted as the premier language. In<br />  the beginning of his career in India, Gandhi gave a great impetus to Hindi<br />  but as he found that the Muslims did not like it, he became a champion of<br />  what is called Hindustani.. Everybody in India knows that there is no<br />  language called Hindustani; it has no grammar; it has no vocabulary. It is a<br />  mere dialect, it is spoken, but not written. It is a bastard tongue and<br />  cross-breed between Hindi and Urdu, and not even the Mahatma's sophistry<br />  could make it popular. But in his desire to please the Muslims he insisted<br />  that Hindustani alone should be the national language of India. His blind<br />  followers, of course, supported him and the so-called hybrid language began<br />  to be used.. </p>
<p>  The charm and purity of the Hindi language was to be prostituted to please<br />  the Muslims. All his experiments were at the expense of the Hindus. From<br />  August 1946 onwards the private armies of the Muslim League began a massacre<br />  of the Hindus. The then Viceroy, Lord Wavell, though distressed at what was<br />  happening, would not use his powers under the Government of India Act of<br />  1935 to prevent the rape, murder and arson. The Hindu blood began to flow<br />  from Bengal to Karachi with some retaliation by the Hindus. The Interim<br />  Government formed in September was sabotaged by its Muslim League members<br />  right from its inception, but the more they became disloyal and treasonable<br />  to the government of which they were a part, the greater was Gandhi's<br />  infatuation for them. Lord Wavell had to resign as he could not bring about<br />  a settlement and he was succeeded by Lord Mountbatten. King Log was followed<br />  by King Stork. The Congress which had boasted of its nationalism and<br />  socialism secretly accepted Pakistan literally at the point of the bayonet<br />  and abjectly surrendered to Jinnah. India was vivisected and one-third of<br />  the Indian territory became foreign land to us from August 15, 1947. </p>
<p>  Lord Mountbatten came to be described in Congress circles as the greatest<br />  Viceroy and Governor-General this country ever had. The official date for<br />  handing over power was fixed for June 30, 1948, but Mountbatten with his<br />  ruthless surgery gave us a gift of vivisected India ten months in advance.<br />  This is what Gandhi had achieved after thirty years of undisputed<br />  dictatorship and this is what Congress party calls 'freedom' and 'peaceful<br />  transfer of power'. The Hindu-Muslim unity bubble was finally burst and a<br />  theocratic state was established with the consent of Nehru and his crowd and<br />  they have called 'freedom won by them with sacrifice' - whose sacrifice?<br />  When top leaders of Congress, with the consent of Gandhi, divided and tore<br />  the country - which we consider a deity of worship - my mind was filled with<br />  direful anger. </p>
<p>  One of the conditions imposed by Gandhi for his breaking of the fast unto<br />  death related to the mosques in Delhi occupied by the Hindu refugees. But<br />  when Hindus in Pakistan were subjected to violent attacks he did not so much<br />  as utter a single word to protest and censure the Pakistan Government or the<br />  Muslims concerned. Gandhi was shrewd enough to know that while undertaking a<br />  fast unto death, had he imposed for its break some condition on the Muslims<br />  in Pakistan, there would have been found hardly any Muslims who could have<br />  shown some grief if the fast had ended in his death. It was for this reason<br />  that he purposely avoided imposing any condition on the Muslims. He was<br />  fully aware of from the experience that Jinnah was not at all perturbed or<br />  influenced by his fast and the Muslim League hardly attached any value to<br />  the inner voice of Gandhi. Gandhi is being referred to as the Father of the<br />  Nation. But if that is so, he had failed his paternal duty inasmuch as he<br />  has acted very treacherously to the nation by his consenting to the<br />  partitioning of it. I stoutly maintain that Gandhi has failed in his duty.<br />  He has proved to be the Father of Pakistan. His inner-voice, his spiritual<br />  power and his doctrine of non-violence of which so much is made of, all<br />  crumbled before Jinnah's iron will and proved to be powerless. Briefly<br />  speaking, I thought to myself and foresaw I shall be totally ruined, and the<br />  only thing I could expect from the people would be nothing but hatred and<br />  that I shall have lost all my honour, even more valuable than my life, ifI<br />  were to kill Gandhiji. But at the same time I felt that the Indian politics<br />  in the absence of Gandhiji would surely be proved practical, able to<br />  retaliate, and would be powerful with armed forces. No doubt, my own future<br />  would be totally ruined, but the nation would be saved from the inroads of<br />  Pakistan. People may even call me and dub me as devoid of any sense or<br />  foolish, but the nation would be free to follow the course founded on the<br />  reason which I consider to be necessary for sound nation-building. After<br />  having fully considered the question, I took the final decision in the<br />  matter, but I did not speak about it to anyone whatsoever. I took couragein<br />  both my hands and I did fire the shots at Gandhiji on 30th January 1948, on<br />  the prayer-grounds of Birla House. I do say that my shots were fired at the<br />  person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin and destruction to<br />  millions of Hindus. There was no legal machinery by which such an offender<br />  could be brought to book and for this reason I fired those fatal shots. I<br />  bear no ill will towards anyone individually but I do say that I had no<br />  respect for the present government owing to their policy which was unfairly<br />  favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could clearly see<br />  that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi. </p>
<p>  I have to say with great regret that Prime Minister Nehru quite forgets<br />  that his preachings and deeds are at times at variances with each other when<br />  he talks about India as a secular state in season and out of season, because<br />  it is significant to note that Nehru has played a leading role in the<br />  establishment of the theocratic state of Pakistan, and his job was made<br />  easier by Gandhi's persistent policy of appeasement towards the Muslims. I<br />  now stand before the court to accept the full share of my responsibility for<br />  what I have done and the judge would, of course, pass against me such orders<br />  of sentence as may be considered proper. But I would like to add that I do<br />  not desire any mercy to be shown to me, nor do I wish that anyone else<br />  should beg for mercy on my behalf. My confidence about the moral side of my<br />  action has not been shaken even by the criticism levelled against it on all<br />  sides. I have no doubt that honest writers of history will weigh my act and<br />  find the true value thereof some day in future. </p>

<p>  the fact remains that everybody at the helm, the british , congress and the<br />  muslim leauge were for the partition. only gandhi was against it, but<br />  realised it was something he could never fight against.<br />  perhaps he had lost the will after seeing the riots.</p>
<p>    Venkat, no am not against the partition per se but I belive the British<br />  created the seeds of long lasting enemity and discontent when they created a<br />  hindu nation and muslim nation </p>
<p>  when bahadur shah was exiled there was an ethic cleansing in delhi. muslim<br />  men were shot or hanged. women and children thrown out of the fort walls to<br />  die of cold and were at the mercy of the gurjar dacoits.<br />  the muslim properties were auctioned and hindus picked it up.</p>
<p>  this is a fact.<br />  so playing the hindu card against muslims and viceversa was common with the<br />  british.</p>
<p>  but still looking at whats happening in pakisthan and bangladesh i am glad<br />  partition happened. it would have been anarchy otherwise. imagine governing<br />  the north west frontier. p. chidambaram would go bald faster.</p>
<p>  venketesh</p>
<p>  in other words splitting the country on religious grounds was a huge mistake<br />  to do.<br />    Gandhi's unhappiness over the partition was also based on this idea that<br />  it made religious amity impossible not to mention displacing millions of<br />  families.</p>
<p>    There is no telling what would have happened if the country was not<br />  partitioned on religious grounds. We might have had some states splitting<br />  off and making smaller countries. We might have still had a bigger country<br />  with lots of turmoil but atleast less fights on basis of religion. Who<br />  knows...it does remain a fact though that it was a poor strategy since<br />  relations remain poor to this day.</p>

<p>      . Gandhi's principles were of huge importance to him - a politician can<br />  only go so far with principles, like a businessman his primary interst<br />  should be his survival and survival of the people he represents - to my mind<br />  Gandhi did not look at it that way and we paid a very heavy price.</p>
<p>      Maloo <br />      so you think we lost because of partition.<br />      why dont you spare a thought to a complete india. i certainly don t want<br />  Swat valley in homeland. even it being in the back yard guives us so much<br />  trouble.</p>
<p>      india because of a different demographics must have been a terrible<br />  place to live in if it had not been divided. racial riot, bigotry and what<br />  not would have filed our newspapers.<br />      no thank you ma.<br />      i like the borders as they are.<br />      i think this was taken into account by leading politicians along withth<br />  british so worried about their legacy. gandhi was fighting both jinnah and<br />  the congres on this issue.</p>

        <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I would like to share the below article with you all, as we could understand<br />what Godse's felt about Gandhiji.</p>
<p>Gandhiji Assassin Nathuram Godse's Final Address to the Court </p>
<p>Nathuram Godse was arrested immediately after he assassinated Gandhiji,<br />based on a F. I. R. filed by Nandlal Mehta at the Tughlak Road Police staton<br />at Delhi. The trial, which was held in camera, began on 27th May 1948 and<br />concluded on 10th February 1949. He was sentenced to death.. An appeal to<br />the Punjab High Court, then in session at Simla, did not find favour and the<br />sentence was upheld. </p>
<p>The statement that you are about to read is the last made by Godse before<br />the Court on the 5th of May 1949. Such was the power and eloquence of this<br />statement that one of the judges, G. D. Khosla, later wrote, "I have,<br />however, no doudt that had the audience of that day been constituted into a<br />jury and entrusted with the task of deciding Godse's appeal, they would have<br />brought a verdict of 'not Guilty' by an overwhelming majority" </p>
<p>WHY I KILLED GANDHI </p>
<p>Born in a devotional Brahmin family, I instinctively came to revere Hindu<br />religion, Hindu history and Hindu culture. I had, therefore, been intensely<br />proud of Hinduism as a whole. As I grew up I developed a tendency to free<br />thinking unfettered by any superstitious allegiance to any isms, political<br />or religious. That is why I worked actively for the eradication of<br />untouchability and the caste system based on birth alone. I openly joined<br />anti-caste movements and maintained that all Hindus were of equal status as<br />to rights, social and religious and should be considered high or low on<br />merit alone and not through the accident of birth in a particular caste or<br />profession. I used publicly to take part in organized anti-caste dinners in<br />which thousands of Hindus, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Chamars and<br />Bhangis participated. We broke the caste rules and dined in the company of<br />each other. I have read the speeches and writings of Dadabhai Naoroji,<br />Vivekanand, Gokhale, Tilak, along with the books of ancient and modern<br />history of India and some prominent countries like England, France, America<br />and Russia. Moreover I studied the tenets of Socialism and Marxism. But<br />above all I studied very closely whatever Veer Savarkar and Gandhiji had<br />written and spoken, as to my mind these two ideologies have contributed more<br />to the moulding of the thought and action of the Indian people during the<br />last thirty years or so, than any other single factor has done. </p>
<p>All this reading and thinking led me to believe it was my first duty to<br />serve Hindudom and Hindus both as a patriot and as a world citizen. To<br />secure the freedom and to safeguard the just interests of some thirty crores<br />(300 million) of Hindus would automatically constitute the freedom and the<br />well-being of all India, one fifth of human race. This conviction led me<br />naturally to devote myself to the Hindu Sanghtanist ideology and programme,<br />which alone, I came to believe, could win and preserve the national<br />independence of Hindustan, my Motherland, and enable her to render true<br />service to humanity as well. </p>
<p>Since the year 1920, that is, after the demise of Lokamanya Tilak,<br />Gandhiji's influence in the Congress first increased and then became<br />supreme. His activities for public awakening were phenomenal in their<br />intensity and were reinforced by the slogan of truth and non-violence which<br />he paraded ostentatiously before the country. No sensible or enlightened<br />person could object to those slogans. In fact there is nothing new or<br />original in them. They are implicit in every constitutional public movement.<br />But it is nothing but a mere dream if you imagine that the bulk of mankind<br />is, or can ever become, capable of scrupulous adherence to these lofty<br />principles in its normal life from day to day. </p>
<p>In fact, honour, duty and love of one's own kith and kin and country might<br />often compel us to disregard non-violence and to use force. I could never<br />conceive that an armed resistance to an aggression is unjust. I would<br />consider it a religious and moral duty to resist and, if possible, to<br />overpower such an enemy by use of force. [In the Ramayana] Rama killed<br />Ravana in a tumultuous fight and relieved Sita.. [In the Mahabharata],<br />Krishna killed Kansa to end his wickedness; and Arjuna had to fight and slay<br />quite a number of his friends and relations including the revered Bhishma<br />because the latter was on the side of the aggressor. It is my firm belief<br />that in dubbing Rama, Krishna and Arjuna as guilty of violence, the Mahatma<br />betrayed a total ignorance of the springs of human action. In more recent<br />history, it was the heroic fight put up by Chhatrapati Shivaji that first<br />checked and eventually destroyed the Muslim tyranny in India. It was<br />absolutely essentially for Shivaji to overpower and kill an aggressive Afzal<br />Khan, failing which he would have lost his own life. In condemning history's<br />towering warriors like Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind Singh as<br />misguided patriots, Gandhiji has merely exposed his self-conceit. He was,<br />paradoxical as it may appear, a violent pacifist who brought untold<br />calamities on the country in the name of truth and non-violence, while Rana<br />Pratap, Shivaji and the Guru will remain enshrined in the hearts of their<br />countrymen for ever for the freedom they brought to them. </p>
<p>The accumulating provocation of thirty-two years, culminating in his last<br />pro-Muslim fast, at last goaded me to the conclusion that the existence of<br />Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately. Gandhi had done very good in<br />South Africa to uphold the rights and well-being of the Indian community<br />there. But when he finally returned to India he developed a subjective<br />mentality under which he alone was to be the final judge of what was right<br />or wrong. If the country wanted his leadership, it had to accept his<br />infallibility; if it did not, he would stand aloof from the Congress and<br />carry on his own way. Against such an attitude there can be no halfway<br />house. Either Congress had to surrender its will to his and had to be<br />content with playing second fiddle to all his eccentricity, whimsicality,<br />metaphysics and primitive vision, or it had to carry on without him. He<br />alone was the Judge of everyone and every thing; he was the master brain<br />guiding the civil disobedience movement; no other could know the technique<br />of that movement. He alone knew when to begin and when to withdraw it. The<br />movement might succeed or fail, it might bring untold disaster and political<br />reverses but that could make no difference to the Mahatma's infallibility.<br />'A Satyagrahi can never fail' was his formula for declaring his own<br />infallibility and nobody except himself knew what a Satyagrahi is. Thus, the<br />Mahatma became the judge and jury in his own cause. These childish<br />insanities and obstinacies, coupled with a most severe austerity of life,<br />ceaseless work and lofty character made Gandhi formidable and irresistible.<br />Many people thought that his politics were irrational but they had either to<br />withdraw from the Congress or place their intelligence at his feet to do<br />with as he liked. In a position of such absolute irresponsibility Gandhi was<br />guilty of blunder after blunder, failure after failure, disaster after<br />disaster. Gandhi's pro-Muslim policy is blatantly in his perverse attitude<br />on the question of the national language of India.

Everybody in India knows that there is no<br />language called Hindustani; it has no grammar; it has no vocabulary. It is a<br />mere dialect, it is spoken, but not written. It is a bastard tongue and<br />cross-breed between Hindi and Urdu, and not even the Mahatma's sophistry<br />could make it popular. But in his desire to please the Muslims he insisted<br />that Hindustani alone should be the national language of India. His blind<br />followers, of course, supported him and the so-called hybrid language began<br />to be used.. </p>
<p>The charm and purity of the Hindi language was to be prostituted to please<br />the Muslims. All his experiments were at the expense of the Hindus. From<br />August 1946 onwards the private armies of the Muslim League began a massacre<br />of the Hindus. The then Viceroy, Lord Wavell, though distressed at what was<br />happening, would not use his powers under the Government of India Act of<br />1935 to prevent the rape, murder and arson. The Hindu blood began to flow<br />from Bengal to Karachi with some retaliation by the Hindus. The Interim<br />Government formed in September was sabotaged by its Muslim League members<br />right from its inception, but the more they became disloyal and treasonable<br />to the government of which they were a part, the greater was Gandhi's<br />infatuation for them. Lord Wavell had to resign as he could not bring about<br />a settlement and he was succeeded by Lord Mountbatten. King Log was followed<br />by King Stork. The Congress which had boasted of its nationalism and<br />socialism secretly accepted Pakistan literally at the point of the bayonet<br />and abjectly surrendered to Jinnah. India was vivisected and one-third of<br />the Indian territory became foreign land to us from August 15, 1947. </p>
<p>Lord Mountbatten came to be described in Congress circles as the greatest<br />Viceroy and Governor-General this country ever had. The official date for<br />handing over power was fixed for June 30, 1948, but Mountbatten with his<br />ruthless surgery gave us a gift of vivisected India ten months in advance.<br />This is what Gandhi had achieved after thirty years of undisputed<br />dictatorship and this is what Congress party calls 'freedom' and 'peaceful<br />transfer of power'. The Hindu-Muslim unity bubble was finally burst and a<br />theocratic state was established with the consent of Nehru and his crowd and<br />they have called 'freedom won by them with sacrifice' - whose sacrifice?<br />When top leaders of Congress, with the consent of Gandhi, divided and tore<br />the country - which we consider a deity of worship - my mind was filled with<br />direful anger. </p>
<p>One of the conditions imposed by Gandhi for his breaking of the fast unto<br />death related to the mosques in Delhi occupied by the Hindu refugees. But<br />when Hindus in Pakistan were subjected to violent attacks he did not so much<br />as utter a single word to protest and censure the Pakistan Government or the<br />Muslims concerned. Gandhi was shrewd enough to know that while undertaking a<br />fast unto death, had he imposed for its break some condition on the Muslims<br />in Pakistan, there would have been found hardly any Muslims who could have<br />shown some grief if the fast had ended in his death. It was for this reason<br />that he purposely avoided imposing any condition on the Muslims. He was<br />fully aware of from the experience that Jinnah was not at all perturbed or<br />influenced by his fast and the Muslim League hardly attached any value to<br />the inner voice of Gandhi. Gandhi is being referred to as the Father of the<br />Nation. But if that is so, he had failed his paternal duty inasmuch as he<br />has acted very treacherously to the nation by his consenting to the<br />partitioning of it. I stoutly maintain that Gandhi has failed in his duty.<br />He has proved to be the Father of Pakistan. His inner-voice, his spiritual<br />power and his doctrine of non-violence of which so much is made of, all<br />crumbled before Jinnah's iron will and proved to be powerless. Briefly<br />speaking, I thought to myself and foresaw I shall be totally ruined, and the<br />only thing I could expect from the people would be nothing but hatred and<br />that I shall have lost all my honour, even more valuable than my life, if I<br />were to kill Gandhiji. But at the same time I felt that the Indian politics<br />in the absence of Gandhiji would surely be proved practical, able to<br />retaliate, and would be powerful with armed forces. No doubt, my own future<br />would be totally ruined, but the nation would be saved from the inroads of<br />Pakistan. People may even call me and dub me as devoid of any sense or<br />foolish, but the nation would be free to follow the course founded on the<br />reason which I consider to be necessary for sound nation-building. After<br />having fully considered the question, I took the final decision in the<br />matter, but I did not speak about it to anyone whatsoever. I took courage in<br />both my hands and I did fire the shots at Gandhiji on 30th January 1948, on<br />the prayer-grounds of Birla House. I do say that my shots were fired at the<br />person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin and destruction to<br />millions of Hindus. There was no legal machinery by which such an offender<br />could be brought to book and for this reason I fired those fatal shots. I<br />bear no ill will towards anyone individually but I do say that I had no<br />respect for the present government owing to their policy which was unfairly<br />favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could clearly see<br />that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi. </p>
<p>I have to say with great regret that Prime Minister Nehru quite forgets<br />that his preachings and deeds are at times at variances with each other when<br />he talks about India as a secular state in season and out of season, because<br />it is significant to note that Nehru has played a leading role in the<br />establishment of the theocratic state of Pakistan, and his job was made<br />easier by Gandhi's persistent policy of appeasement towards the Muslims. I<br />now stand before the court to accept the full share of my responsibility for<br />what I have done and the judge would, of course, pass against me such orders<br />of sentence as may be considered proper. But I would like to add that I do<br />not desire any mercy to be shown to me, nor do I wish that anyone else<br />should beg for mercy on my behalf. My confidence about the moral side of my<br />action has not been shaken even by the criticism levelled against it on all<br />sides. I have no doubt that honest writers of history will weigh my act and<br />find the true value thereof some day in future. </p>

<p>Looking from the mind-set prevailed in late forties - after WW II - Partition and subseqent formation of States based on linguistic majority - deserve serious consideration ..</p>
<p>some more reinforcements in the frame-would have been done.. !</p>
<p>As we have been reading (Forsyth ?) when the USSR Pres and the USA Pres meet - it is not that they discuss directly, but the beaurocracts discuss / would have discussed already !</p>
<p>Likewise - Gandhiji (for that matter including Nehruji - really do not knowto say YES or NO) - might not have been aware what was going on parallely between the British and the North-West leaders - just prior to Independence.</p>

        <p>Venkat, no am not against the partition per se but I belive the British created the seeds of long lasting enemity and discontent when they created a hindu nation and muslim nation in other words splitting the country on religious grounds was a huge mistake to do.<br />Gandhi's unhappiness over the partition was also based on this idea that itmade religious amity impossible not to mention displacing millions of families.</p>
<p>There is no telling what would have happened if the country was not partitioned on religious grounds. We might have had some states splitting off and making smaller countries. We might have still had a bigger country with lots of turmoil but atleast less fights on basis of religion. Who knows...it does remain a fact though that it was a poor strategy since relations remainpoor to this day.</p>

        <p>Actually there is no saint who 'would not hurt a fly' - saints are human beings with some spiritual experiences and every one of them have had their dark sides. </p>
<p>Gandhi's principles - raising the self respect of people and non violent protests are time tested values and under his great leadership they did contribute greatly. The British raj was collapsing but they would not have givenus the country we know today if it was not for Gandhi to some extent and the many people who followed his principles. Where Gandhi failed (among other things) the country was his liberal attitude towards Jinnah and his stubborness to resolve the partition his way (fasting and offering the prime ministership on a plate to a reluctant selfish Jinnah). Gandhi's principles were of huge importance to him - a politician can only go so far with principles, like a businessman his primary interst should be his survival and survival of the people he represents - to my mind Gandhi did not look at it that way and we paid a very heavy price.</p>

        <p>Hi Venkat, am not at all sure what you mean by the 'gandhi we know'? Every public figure has a private face to him, i think we talked once about the book by Gandhi's grandson where he talks of his grandfather's attraction to another woman politician in his latter years.</p>
<p>Shrewd politician? Gandhi? That sounds strange to me, he was a bad politician and let the country down especially during partition (people with valuesand integrity rarely make good politicians anyway). If anybody was shrewd I could call our late Rajaji shrewd, not Gandhi. </p>
<p>The way I see Gandhi was that a person who genuinely tried to be a better human being (btw he didnt' ask for the 'mahatma' title it was conferred on him) - a human being with many fallacies and yet someone who tried his best all the time with no cynical disbelief attached.</p>
<p>I react to these things (the initial remark) because it is somewhat of a fashion these days to throw remarks at big people like they did nothing, and I belive if we pass a criticism we must do so with due respect to what somenoe did for us, am sure you agree(or in other words better a foolish believer than a smart cynic).</p>
<p>Sorry for the long explanation, would love to hear what you say,</p>

<p>  the arch is going to be brought down because its stability is gone.</p>

<p>  of course a typical question in a quiz on chennai would be</p>
<p>  name 3 women who have statues on the marina</p>
<p>  or name 2 europeans who have statues on the marina.</p>
<p>    Thomas Manro statue ..</p>

<p>of course a typical question in a quiz on chennai would be</p>
<p>name 3 women who have statues on the marina<br />or name 2 europeans who have statues on the marina.</p>
