<p>  There is an ancient coin preserved in Chennai museum: ..ori.. <br />  Tamil writings on one side.. A small mountain like inverted M , with flowof river and rocks on other side.</p>
<p>  Kudavoil Dr. Balasubramanian researched and found that such place exists near Thirukkattupalli and the stone beds are natural. According to him THISWAS ORIGINAL KALLANAI . <br />  Trichy Kallanai is Nayakar-built. <br />  ============ ===</p>
<p>  Nearby place was Nemam Aayirathali (1000 lingas Temple).. In mid <br />  1950s when there was a flood, a bund was constructed by the locals to arrest the flow of water and alas! majority of our 1000 lingas were used as stones in the bund. <br />  Pallavas are known for such grandeurs (1000 lingas etc).. Nemam aayirathali was during Nandhivarman period... before Vijayalayan. ..located close toNandhipuram / <br />  Thirukkanbdiyur!<br />  ============<br />  OTHER INTERESTING MAILS from Archieves ::</p>

<p>  Rajarajan madai and uthamachozhan madai were used in chola land.<br />  Veerapandiyan madai was in use in pandiya land during veera pandiyan<br />  times - and continued to exist for some time during uttama times in<br />  pandiya lands.</p>

<p>      I am writing from memory and the poem is a conversation between two <br />    paanans: one is back from the court of the vaana king and the other sees <br />    him surrounded by chariots and elephants,horses etc as though he were a <br />    king.The latter asks him about the country for which he is king and forhs <br />    name.To which the former tells him that he is only a paanan who has <br />    received from the vaana king ,Mahadevan of Aarai, and assures him that he <br />    may also get similar gifts from him if he went into the courtyard of the <br />    vaana king \where an aathi tree,a vempu tree, a panai tree,an aracu tree <br />    and an athi tree would stand.These are also the insignia of the <br />    cera,cola,pandya kings.Athi stands also for an elephant which carries aking<br />    (Aracu). <br />      Aarai is here said to be the town guarded by vaanapoopati. Pazhaiya aarai <br />    might have later become pazhayaarai.

<p>        Nandhipuram @ Nadhankoil was near Kumbakonam, with a Perumal <br />      temple.</p>
<p>        Sundarachozhan is known as Nandhipura Sundaracholar which place is <br />      3 <br />        KM south west of Kumbakonam. RAJARAJAN in his last days was bed-<br />        ridden in the Aayirathali Palace in Pazhayarai. (Don't know how <br />      this <br />        information was derived)</p>
<p>        Source for these statements is from Thirukkodikka <br />        inscription : "Idhuvum oru Pazhangalpadi Kovirajakesari panmarkku <br />        yaandu 15vadhu PAZHAYATRU NANDHIPURATHU vyapari Kumaran Kanavathi <br />        Thirukkodikka Mahadevakku. . grant"</p>
<p>        person is from Pazhayarai Nandhipuram.

<p>        There were only TWO Aayirathalis in Tamil History: (1) Pandiya <br />        kulanasini valanattu aarkkattu kkootrathu Niyamathu Aayirathali; <br />      (2) <br />        Nithavinodha valanattu Kizhar kootrathu Nandhipuramana aayirathali.</p>
<p>        Nemam is near Thirukkattuppalli. There is another interesting <br />        theory. Here was the original Kallanai. I have already put this <br />      in <br />        one of my earlier mails. In Pazhayarai there was no Aayirathali. <br />        Niyamathu Sahasralingeswaram says Senthalai inscription.</p>
<p>        Thalicheri inscriptions in Big Temple denote the shares for:</p>
<p>        Door no: 49 Aayirathali Nakkan aiyaru; 18: Aayirathali Nakkan <br />        Anavaradha Sundari; 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 26, 35, 36, 37 ? were <br />      also <br />        belonged to various Nakkans of Aayirathali.</p>
<p>        Thirukkandiyur inscriptions talk of Vaageesar (Laguleesam :: <br />      earlier <br />        mail) Vanavan Madecharam etc. </p>
<p>        Periya Pazhuvettarayar was MARAVAN KANDANAR . (Ref: Earlier mails <br />      on <br />        this subject : including Udayarkudi inscriptions) Melappazhuvur <br />        inscriptions in his 10th and 11th Regnl.

<p>        After destroying Cholas, Sundara Pandiyan performed his <br />      Veerabishekam <br />        in this Nandhipuram palace only ? according to Thiruparankundram <br />        inscription. This is reconfirmed in Srivilliputhur inscription. <br />        Since this was Pallava's place, this was not under Chola's control <br />        till Parantaka I.. After Sundara cholan, Kulothunga I used this <br />      Palace <br />        which was known as Ahavamalla Kulakavathu Palace ? Kalingarayan <br />        Seat. The grant conferred for Buddist Vihar in Nagai is known as <br />        Small Leiden Copper plates. This place was also known as <br />      MEENAVANAI <br />        MEN KANDA CHOLAPURAM. Hence Sundara Pandya performed his <br />        Veerabishekam here. By Valavan, there is an interpretation for <br />        Killivalavan also. Rajendra brought Indira aaram (maalai) and <br />        Sundara Mudi (Crown of Pandyas) from Ealam. Kulothunga III <br />      destroyed <br />        Madurai Palace and seeded Varahu and ploughed with Donkeys. That <br />      is <br />        why Sundara Pandyan has taken his revenge in similar way against <br />        Cholas. Here existed Sundara Cholan &amp; Vaanavan Madevi's <br />      Pallippadai <br />        and hence he was known as "Pon Maaligai Thunjiya Devar".</p>
<p>        Presently this place is known as Rettakkoil, Veerasingampettai, <br />        Sengamedu &amp; Aavikkarai in Thirukkandiyur. Wherever they dig, the <br />        people are finding Sivalingams. <br />      ============ ========= ========= ========= ====<br />      Dear Friends,<br />      The thought of Nandhipuram has been haunting me for quite some time. <br />      Last Sunday, I visited Nandhipuram @ Veerasingampettai <br />      (Thirukkandiyur) with Dr.Kudavoil Balu.

<p>  Nearby place was Nemam Aayirathali (1000 lingas Temple). In mid <br />  1950s when there was a flood, a bund was constructed by the locals to arrest the flow of water and alas! majority of our 1000 lingas were used as stones in the bund. <br />  Pallavas are known for such grandeurs (1000 lingas etc)..

<p>      R.Gopalan says In History of Pallavas of South India:<br />      Nandhipuram is identical with Nandhipura Vinnagaram of Thirumangai <br />      alwar near Kknm;       <br />      KA Sastri :: History of South India<br />      Earlier Rajasimha formed an alliance with Vikramaditya II and <br />    after <br />      inflicting a number of defeats on Nandhivarman, Pallavamalla <br />    besieged <br />      him in a place called Nandigrama i.e., Nandhipuram near Kumbakonam?</p>
<p>      M.RASAMANICKANAR :: Pallavar Varalaru</p>
<p>      Nandhipuram @ Nadhankoil was near Kumbakonam, with a Perumal <br />    temple.</p>
<p>      Sundarachozhan is known as Nandhipura Sundaracholar which place is <br />    3 <br />      KM south west of Kumbakonam. RAJARAJAN in his last days was bed-<br />      ridden in the Aayirathali Palace in Pazhayarai. (Don't know how <br />    this <br />      information was derived)</p>
<p>      Source for these statements is from Thirukkodikka <br />      inscription : "Idhuvum oru Pazhangalpadi Kovirajakesari panmarkku <br />      yaandu 15vadhu PAZHAYATRU NANDHIPURATHU vyapari Kumaran Kanavathi <br />      Thirukkodikka Mahadevakku. . grant"</p>
<p>      person is from Pazhayarai Nandhipuram. There is another Umbala <br />      naattu Nandhipuram (near Vedharanyam) .<br />      Subject Nandhipuram is NITHA VINODHA VALANATTU KIZHAR KOOTRATHIL <br />      AAYIRATHALI NANDHIPURAM. Pazhayarai Nandhipuram is Uyyakondar <br />      valanaattu Thirunaraiyur Nattu (Thirunaraiyur = Nachiarkoil) <br />      Pazhayarai Nandhipuram.</p>
<p>      Other sources: (1) Grant to Thiruppalanam by Kizhaar Kootrathu <br />      Devadhana Nandhipuram Aayirathali thiruvadi.." (2) <br />    Thiruchotruthurai <br />      grant by "Nandhipuramana aayirathali vyabari mazhapadi.. " ? <br />      belonging to Parantaka I.</p>
<p>      There were only TWO Aayirathalis in Tamil History: (1) Pandiya <br />      kulanasini valanattu aarkkattu kkootrathu Niyamathu Aayirathali; <br />    (2) <br />      Nithavinodha valanattu Kizhar kootrathu Nandhipuramana aayirathali.</p>
<p>      Nemam is near Thirukkattuppalli. There is another interesting <br />      theory. Here was the original Kallanai. I have already put this <br />    in <br />      one of my earlier mails. In Pazhayarai there was no Aayirathali. <br />      Niyamathu Sahasralingeswaram says Senthalai inscription.</p>
<p>      Thalicheri inscriptions in Big Temple denote the shares for:</p>
<p>      Door no: 49 Aayirathali Nakkan aiyaru; 18: Aayirathali Nakkan <br />      Anavaradha Sundari; 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 26, 35, 36, 37 ? were <br />    also <br />      belonged to various Nakkans of Aayirathali.</p>
<p>      Thirukkandiyur inscriptions talk of Vaageesar (Laguleesam :: <br />    earlier <br />      mail) Vanavan Madecharam etc. </p>
<p>      Periya Pazhuvettarayar was MARAVAN KANDANAR . (Ref: Earlier mails <br />    on <br />      this subject : including Udayarkudi inscriptions) Melappazhuvur <br />      inscriptions in his 10th and 11th Regnl. Yrs speak of : " <br />      Pazhuvettarayar Maravan Kandanar Avani Kandarpurathu mandrupadu <br />      epperpattathu pandai Nandhipura mattradhiye kollka enru aruli? " <br />    For <br />      systems of Avani Kandarvapuram, follow the system that exists in <br />      Nandhipuram "</p>
<p>      After destroying Cholas, Sundara Pandiyan performed his <br />    Veerabishekam <br />      in this Nandhipuram palace only ? according to Thiruparankundram <br />      inscription. This is reconfirmed in Srivilliputhur inscription. <br />      Since this was Pallava's place, this was not under Chola's control <br />      till Parantaka I.. After Sundara cholan, Kulothunga I used this <br />    Palace <br />      which was known as Ahavamalla Kulakavathu Palace ? Kalingarayan <br />      Seat. The grant conferred for Buddist Vihar in Nagai is known as <br />      Small Leiden Copper plates. This place was also known as <br />    MEENAVANAI <br />      MEN KANDA CHOLAPURAM. Hence Sundara Pandya performed his <br />      Veerabishekam here. By Valavan, there is an interpretation for <br />      Killivalavan also. Rajendra brought Indira aaram (maalai) and <br />      Sundara Mudi (Crown of Pandyas) from Ealam. Kulothunga III <br />    destroyed <br />      Madurai Palace and seeded Varahu and ploughed with Donkeys. That <br />    is <br />      why Sundara Pandyan has taken his revenge in similar way against <br />      Cholas. Here existed Sundara Cholan &amp; Vaanavan Madevi's <br />    Pallippadai <br />      and hence he was known as "Pon Maaligai Thunjiya Devar".</p>
<p>      Presently this place is known as Rettakkoil, Veerasingampettai, <br />      Sengamedu &amp; Aavikkarai in Thirukkandiyur. Wherever they dig, the <br />      people are finding Sivalingams. <br />    ============ ========= ========= ========= ====<br />    Dear Friends,<br />    The thought of Nandhipuram has been haunting me for quite some time. <br />    Last Sunday, I visited Nandhipuram @ Veerasingampettai <br />    (Thirukkandiyur) with Dr.Kudavoil Balu.

South Indian Adviser : Dr. <br />    Nagaswamy, <br />      22, 22nd Cross Street, Besant Nagar, Chennai ? 90. (The Indian <br />      National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage).</sps10142004@y...></p>
<p>      R.Gopalan says In History of Pallavas of South India:<br />      Nandhipuram is identical with Nandhipura Vinnagaram of Thirumangai <br />      alwar near Kknm;       <br />      KA Sastri :: History of South India<br />      Earlier Rajasimha formed an alliance with Vikramaditya II and <br />    after <br />      inflicting a number of defeats on Nandhivarman, Pallavamalla <br />    besieged <br />      him in a place called Nandigrama i.e., Nandhipuram near Kumbakonam?</p>
<p>      M.RASAMANICKANAR :: Pallavar Varalaru</p>
<p>      Nandhipuram @ Nadhankoil was near Kumbakonam, with a Perumal <br />    temple.</p>
<p>      Sundarachozhan is known as Nandhipura Sundaracholar which place is <br />    3 <br />      KM south west of Kumbakonam. RAJARAJAN in his last days was bed-<br />      ridden in the Aayirathali Palace in Pazhayarai. (Don't know how <br />    this <br />      information was derived)</p>
<p>      Source for these statements is from Thirukkodikka <br />      inscription : "Idhuvum oru Pazhangalpadi Kovirajakesari panmarkku <br />      yaandu 15vadhu PAZHAYATRU NANDHIPURATHU vyapari Kumaran Kanavathi <br />      Thirukkodikka Mahadevakku.. grant"</p>
<p>      person is from Pazhayarai Nandhipuram. There is another Umbala <br />      naattu Nandhipuram (near Vedharanyam).<br />      Subject Nandhipuram is NITHA VINODHA VALANATTU KIZHAR KOOTRATHIL <br />      AAYIRATHALI NANDHIPURAM. Pazhayarai Nandhipuram is Uyyakondar <br />      valanaattu Thirunaraiyur Nattu (Thirunaraiyur = Nachiarkoil) <br />      Pazhayarai Nandhipuram.</p>
<p>      Other sources: (1) Grant to Thiruppalanam by Kizhaar Kootrathu <br />      Devadhana Nandhipuram Aayirathali thiruvadi.." (2) <br />    Thiruchotruthurai <br />      grant by "Nandhipuramana aayirathali vyabari mazhapadi.. " ? <br />      belonging to Parantaka I.</p>
<p>      There were only TWO Aayirathalis in Tamil History: (1) Pandiya <br />      kulanasini valanattu aarkkattu kkootrathu Niyamathu Aayirathali; <br />    (2) <br />      Nithavinodha valanattu Kizhar kootrathu Nandhipuramana aayirathali.</p>
<p>      Nemam is near Thirukkattuppalli. There is another interesting <br />      theory. Here was the original Kallanai. I have already put this <br />    in <br />      one of my earlier mails. In Pazhayarai there was no Aayirathali. <br />      Niyamathu Sahasralingeswaram says Senthalai inscription.</p>
<p>      Thalicheri inscriptions in Big Temple denote the shares for:</p>
<p>      Door no: 49 Aayirathali Nakkan aiyaru; 18: Aayirathali Nakkan <br />      Anavaradha Sundari; 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 26, 35, 36, 37 ? were <br />    also <br />      belonged to various Nakkans of Aayirathali.</p>
<p>      Thirukkandiyur inscriptions talk of Vaageesar (Laguleesam :: <br />    earlier <br />      mail) Vanavan Madecharam etc. </p>
<p>      Periya Pazhuvettarayar was MARAVAN KANDANAR . (Ref: Earlier mails <br />    on <br />      this subject : including Udayarkudi inscriptions) Melappazhuvur <br />      inscriptions in his 10th and 11th Regnl. Yrs speak of : " <br />      Pazhuvettarayar Maravan Kandanar Avani Kandarpurathu mandrupadu <br />      epperpattathu pandai Nandhipura mattradhiye kollka enru aruli? " <br />    For <br />      systems of Avani Kandarvapuram, follow the system that exists in <br />      Nandhipuram "</p>
<p>      After destroying Cholas, Sundara Pandiyan performed his <br />    Veerabishekam <br />      in this Nandhipuram palace only ? according to Thiruparankundram <br />      inscription. This is reconfirmed in Srivilliputhur inscription. <br />      Since this was Pallava's place, this was not under Chola's control <br />      till Parantaka I. After Sundara cholan, Kulothunga I used this <br />    Palace <br />      which was known as Ahavamalla Kulakavathu Palace ? Kalingarayan <br />      Seat. The grant conferred for Buddist Vihar in Nagai is known as <br />      Small Leiden Copper plates. This place was also known as <br />    MEENAVANAI <br />      MEN KANDA CHOLAPURAM. Hence Sundara Pandya performed his <br />      Veerabishekam here. By Valavan, there is an interpretation for <br />      Killivalavan also. Rajendra brought Indira aaram (maalai) and <br />      Sundara Mudi (Crown of Pandyas) from Ealam. Kulothunga III <br />    destroyed <br />      Madurai Palace and seeded Varahu and ploughed with Donkeys. That <br />    is <br />      why Sundara Pandyan has taken his revenge in similar way against <br />      Cholas. Here existed Sundara Cholan &amp; Vaanavan Madevi's <br />    Pallippadai <br />      and hence he was known as "Pon Maaligai Thunjiya Devar".</p>
<p>      Presently this place is known as Rettakkoil, Veerasingampettai, <br />      Sengamedu &amp; Aavikkarai in Thirukkandiyur. Wherever they dig, the <br />      people are finding Sivalingams. <br />    ===========================================<br />    Dear Friends,<br />    The thought of Nandhipuram has been haunting me for quite some time. <br />    Last Sunday, I visited Nandhipuram @ Veerasingampettai <br />    (Thirukkandiyur) with Dr.Kudavoil Balu. In 3 / 4 nearby temples we <br />    have seen more than 500 lingas -residuals of Ayirathalai!</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I don't know much about history and historical places.. But when I was<br />studying BE Civil Engg, I had a subject Hydrolgy and water resource<br />engg..during that time I had visited kallanai and read a book borrowed from<br />thanjavur central library..In which it was stated that the present kallanai<br />is founded on the original kallanai built by karikala.<br />Also<br />During the british period the engineer Sir Arthur Cotton found this kallanai<br />and built the sluices above the kallanai. Initially when they planned for<br />the sluices work they found this kallanai area is the best one because<br />during the flood period the surplus water can be diverted to kollidam. After<br />founding this site they decided to demolish the kallanai but when they<br />started demolition the identified that it was very strong due to the lime<br />mortar and also there was very big stones used to construct the kallanai.<br />Finally that engineer decided to use the original kallanai as the foundation<br />for the new kallanai later they modified it to construct sluices to divert<br />the water into differnt rivers like kaveri,vennaru,vettaru....</p>
<p>Please see this link also..<br /><a href="http://www.thanjavur.nic.in/agri.htm" title="http://www.thanjavur.nic.in/agri.htm">http://www.thanjavur.nic.in/agri.htm</a></p>
<p>That book was return by a retired engineer from PWD, I think his name is<br />karuppan...but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Hi sir,</p>
<p>With due respects and thinking aloud </p>
<p>1) if it were merely strengthening the bund, why list it along with <br />something as lofty as flying your flag in the himalayas....definitely <br />both are not at par...</p>
<p>2) why strenthen the bund with stone - without something holding the <br />bunds together a stone bund made of small stones is of no use, the <br />water would just work on the sand below and roll them away - the large <br />boulders are good only to break the speed of the waves ( like the <br />shore temple) but not to contain a flooding.</p>
<p>3) a bund would only be of use to the immediate surronding locales. <br />why would the whole tamil land sing his praise unless it was something <br />that was of use to larger porportion of the population.</p>
<p>3) are there any other dams built by tamil kings....other than the <br />kallanai. if not, why then are there so many techinical words in tamil <br />language on dams ( they dont sound like newly formed words to me)</p>

        <p>Hi <br />always heard kallanai was the oldest functioning dam in the world. <br />the oldest one is however in egypt.<br />arent there mentions of kallanai during later cholas?</p>
<p>then it should atleast be a 1000 years old</p>

<p>  This Niyamam was also known as AAYIRATHALI during Pallava period<br />.. <br />  supposed to contain about 1000 linga temple.. construction of <br />which <br />  Pallavas are known for. There were other Aayirathalis as well.</p>
<p>  Many of these lingam did were used in Kallanai during last Century.</p>
<p>  Some of them are located near Thirukandiyur also.</p>
<p>  Some of them are now positioned in the Northern prakara of Big <br />  temple / Thanjavur.</p>
<p>  Near this Niyamam, Cauvery narrows down between Two heavy rocks - <br />  forming as small mounds - due to a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>  This scene is identical with an ancient coin available in State <br />  Museum, Chennai.</p>
<p>  In this coin, two mounts are shown, water flowing in between on <br />one <br />  side... Other side there was a tamil word.. (forgot.. vaguely <br />  recollecting as THENNAN.. ).</p>
<p>  This coin was found near Nemem belt.</p>
<p>  connecting these things it was postulated that the KALLANAI <br />  originally existed at Nemam (farther East of Tiruchi - before <br />  Thiruvaiyaru) and Karikalan reinforced the bunds of this and made <br />as <br />  a NATURAL DAM .. which has nothing to do with the TRICHY KALLANAI !</p>

<p>      Myth of Antiquity of Tamil --Kallanani by Karikalan</p>
<p>      Myth of Kallanani by Karikalan<br />      The Grand Anicut, also known as the Kallanai, is an ancient <br />dam <br />  in<br />      Tamil Nadu state of south India. The Grand Anicut is the most<br />      ancient surviving irrigation work in Kaveri river delta. It is<br />      attributed to the Chola king Karikalan, and dates back to the <br />2nd<br />      century. It is considered the oldest water-diversion structure <br />in<br />      the world still in use.<br />      A poet sings<br />      "Karikaalan kattivaithaan kallanai"</p>
<p>      Let us analyze the facts<br />      The sangam literature Pattinappaalai sung by uruthirang <br />kannanar <br />  was<br />      solely sung in praise of Karikaal chola. It has no mention of<br />      Kallanai. We only understand that he strengthened the banks of<br />      cauvery.<br />      Thiruttani and Velanjeri Copper Plates<br />      Parantaka's plate is dated 932 A.D. It gives the names of the<br />      progenitors of the Chola line beginning with Vishnu, followed <br />by<br />      Brahma, Marichi, Kasyapa, Surya and Usinara. Karikala, Sibi and<br />      Koccengannan.<br />      Karikala<br />      Three important events in the life of Karikala are mentioned.<br />      (1) He caused the crest of the Cholas marked on the slopes of<br />      Himalayas.<br />      (2) He raised embankments on either side of river Kaveri and<br />      controlled its flood<br />      (3) He made Kanchi a city of palaces.<br />      Udayendram plates<br />      Parantaka Chola's Udayendram plates mention only the name of<br />      Karikala without referring to his exploits.</p>
<p>      Hence Thiruttani and Velanjeri Copper Plates are perhaps the<br />      earliest Chola record to refer to the exploits of Karikala. <br />Even<br />      though his conquests and building Kanchi palaces are as <br />debatable<br />      let us see only Kallanai now.</p>
<p>      The copper plates which mention Karikala as one of the <br />ancestors <br />  of<br />      Cholas do not mention anything about Kallanai. Usually it is<br />      customary to record the grandest achievements of their <br />ancestors<br />      (Sibi- sparrow, Manu needhi - chariot etc)</p>
<p>      One more inscription throws a different light about uruthirang<br />      kannanar A mandapa was donated to kannanar by Karikala . <br />Around <br />  1200<br />      AD Sundara pandiyan ransacked the whole of chola kingdom. He<br />      destroyed all forts, palaces etc. but left this one single <br />  mandapa<br />      untouched! There is a detailed inscription in thiruvellarai - <br />in <br />  the<br />      form of a Tamil poem ? which records this. Though it was a <br />chola<br />    who<br />      donated the gift, it was a gift for a Tamil poet - uruthirang<br />      kannanar - that's all pandiyan considered!<br />      Second if they measured the chola land to device an <br />ulagalanthan<br />      KOL, then there must be some mention of water sources and dams.<br />      However there is no such evidence.</p>
<p>      Karikalan never built Kallanai. Kaverikku iru puramum karai<br />      eduppiththaan.That's all. Kallanai was constructed during Nayak<br />      period. That was verysmall dam and today what we see is the<br />      expansion by British people. Astudent of Jawaharlal Nehru <br />  University<br />      did a PhD on Kallanai and provedbeyond any doubt that it was <br />  built<br />      by nayaks and subsequent expansions byBritish people.</p>
<p>      If we analyze the date of Karikalan , we can come to a <br />  conclusion of<br />      around 9th century or later ,And the other Famous chola king Ko<br />      Chenkkannan praised in sangam literature built Jambukeshwarar <br />  Temple<br />      which still stands today is around 10th century AD, But the <br />  legend<br />      advances the date of sangam literatue to 2nd century AD <br />without <br />  any<br />      basis.</p>

<p>    Myth of Antiquity of Tamil --Kallanani by Karikalan</p>
<p>    Myth of Kallanani by Karikalan<br />    The Grand Anicut, also known as the Kallanai, is an ancient dam in<br />    Tamil Nadu state of south India. The Grand Anicut is the most<br />    ancient surviving irrigation work in Kaveri river delta. It is<br />    attributed to the Chola king Karikalan, and dates back to the 2nd<br />    century. It is considered the oldest water-diversion structure in<br />    the world still in use.<br />    A poet sings<br />    "Karikaalan kattivaithaan kallanai"</p>
<p>    Let us analyze the facts<br />    The sangam literature Pattinappaalai sung by uruthirang kannanar was<br />    solely sung in praise of Karikaal chola. It has no mention of<br />    Kallanai. We only understand that he strengthened the banks of<br />    cauvery.<br />    Thiruttani and Velanjeri Copper Plates<br />    Parantaka's plate is dated 932 A.D. It gives the names of the<br />    progenitors of the Chola line beginning with Vishnu, followed by<br />    Brahma, Marichi, Kasyapa, Surya and Usinara. Karikala, Sibi and<br />    Koccengannan.<br />    Karikala<br />    Three important events in the life of Karikala are mentioned.<br />    (1) He caused the crest of the Cholas marked on the slopes of<br />    Himalayas.<br />    (2) He raised embankments on either side of river Kaveri and<br />    controlled its flood<br />    (3) He made Kanchi a city of palaces.<br />    Udayendram plates<br />    Parantaka Chola's Udayendram plates mention only the name of<br />    Karikala without referring to his exploits.</p>

<p>In Kumudham weekly, it was earlier reported that Karikalan<br />worshipped one "Ey Gowri amman" - now known as Vallam Kali - near<br />Thanjavur.

<p>this Palace which was known as Ahavamalla Kulakavathu Palace ?<br />Kalingarayan Seat. This place was also known as MEENAVANAI MEN<br />KANDA CHOLAPURAM. Hence Sundara Pandya performed his<br />Veerabishekam here. By Valavan, there is an interpretation for<br />Killivalavan also. Rajendra brought Indira aaram (maalai) and<br />Sundara Mudi (Crown of Pandyas) from Ealam. Kulothunga III<br />destroyed Madurai Palace and seeded Varahu and ploughed with<br />Donkeys. That is why Sundara Pandyan has taken his revenge in<br />similar way against Cholas in Pazhayarai Chozhan maligai and other<br />places.</p>
<p>In this Nandhipuram, near Thirukkandiyur - existed Sundara Cholan &amp; Vaanavan Madevi's Pallippadai and hence he was known as "Pon<br />Maaligai Thunjiya Devar" - Not in Kanchi.</p>
<p>Presently this place is known as Rettakkoil, Veerasingampettai,<br />Sengamedu &amp; Aavikkarai in Thirukkandiyur. Wherever they dig,<br />people are finding Sivalingams. More than 600 found so far.</p>

<p>  Myth of Antiquity of Tamil --Kallanani by Karikalan</p>
<p>  Myth of Kallanani by Karikalan<br />  The Grand Anicut, also known as the Kallanai, is an ancient dam in <br />  Tamil Nadu state of south India. The Grand Anicut is the most <br />  ancient surviving irrigation work in Kaveri river delta. It is <br />  attributed to the Chola king Karikalan, and dates back to the 2nd <br />  century. It is considered the oldest water-diversion structure in <br />  the world still in use.<br />  A poet sings<br />  "Karikaalan kattivaithaan kallanai"</p>
<p>  Let us analyze the facts<br />  The sangam literature Pattinappaalai sung by uruthirang kannanar <br />was <br />  solely sung in praise of Karikaal chola. It has no mention of <br />  Kallanai. We only understand that he strengthened the banks of <br />  cauvery.<br />  Thiruttani and Velanjeri Copper Plates<br />  Parantaka's plate is dated 932 A.D. It gives the names of the <br />  progenitors of the Chola line beginning with Vishnu, followed by <br />  Brahma, Marichi, Kasyapa, Surya and Usinara. Karikala, Sibi and <br />  Koccengannan.<br />  Karikala<br />  Three important events in the life of Karikala are mentioned.<br />  (1) He caused the crest of the Cholas marked on the slopes of <br />  Himalayas.<br />  (2) He raised embankments on either side of river Kaveri and <br />  controlled its flood<br />  (3) He made Kanchi a city of palaces.<br />  Udayendram plates<br />  Parantaka Chola's Udayendram plates mention only the name of <br />  Karikala without referring to his exploits.</p>
<p>  Hence Thiruttani and Velanjeri Copper Plates are perhaps the <br />  earliest Chola record to refer to the exploits of Karikala. Even <br />  though his conquests and building Kanchi palaces are as debatable <br />  let us see only Kallanai now.</p>
<p>  The copper plates which mention Karikala as one of the ancestors <br />of <br />  Cholas do not mention anything about Kallanai. Usually it is <br />  customary to record the grandest achievements of their ancestors <br />  (Sibi- sparrow, Manu needhi - chariot etc)</p>
<p>  One more inscription throws a different light about uruthirang <br />  kannanar A mandapa was donated to kannanar by Karikala . Around <br />1200 <br />  AD Sundara pandiyan ransacked the whole of chola kingdom. He <br />  destroyed all forts, palaces etc. but left this one single mandapa <br />  untouched! There is a detailed inscription in thiruvellarai - in <br />the <br />  form of a Tamil poem ? which records this. Though it was a chola <br />who <br />  donated the gift, it was a gift for a Tamil poet - uruthirang <br />  kannanar - that's all pandiyan considered!<br />  Second if they measured the chola land to device an ulagalanthan <br />  KOL, then there must be some mention of water sources and dams. <br />  However there is no such evidence.</p>
<p>  If we analyze the date of Karikalan , we can come to a conclusion <br />of <br />  around 9th century or later ,And the other Famous chola king Ko <br />  Chenkkannan praised in sangam literature built Jambukeshwarar <br />Temple <br />  which still stands today is around 10th century AD, But the legend <br />  advances the date of sangam literatue to 2nd century AD without <br />any <br />  basis.</p>

<p>After his Srilanka invasion, he brought around 15000<br />slaves and engaged them to built the dam. Originally<br />it was built to divert flooded water to save Puhar<br />city. Diverted kollidam water used for irrigation<br />system. Unfortunately great city of Puhar swallowed by<br />sea.<br />- This is a new information for me. As far as I know, it is a marvelous Engineering design, for that period.</p>
<p>Can any one specify the ruling period of "Karikal Valavan"?</p>
<p>May be Nayak kings done some fortifications as British<br />did during their respective times.</p>
<p>I am not sure whether emperor Rajaraja Cholan built<br />the big bull in the big temple or Nayak kings did.</p>
<p>- As per Madhan the big Nandhi is built by Nayaks; The original one done by Rajaraja Cholan was housed in another place.</p>
<p>- Have you all noted, The Female deity statue is also very great..... So nicely done</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Emperor Karikal Cholan built kallanai is well known<br />fact.</p>
<p>After his Srilanka invasion, he brought around 15000<br />slaves and engaged them to built the dam. Originally<br />it was built to divert flooded water to save Puhar<br />city. Diverted kollidam water used for irrigation<br />system. Unfortunately great city of Puhar swallowed by<br />sea.</p>
<p>May be Nayak kings done some fortifications as British<br />did during their respective times.</p>
<p>I am not sure whether emperor Rajaraja Cholan built<br />the big bull in the big temple or Nayak kings did.</p>

<p>      1.Was the dam was actually built by Nayak kings<br />    while Karikalan <br />    just strengthened the bunds?</p>
<p>      This question has to answered in a very detailed<br />    manner taking into <br />    account of the nayaks rule <br />      and the local people over there at that time.<br />    After the Pandya <br />    Kingdom was destroyed by maulikafur due to the<br />    Pandya brother's fued <br />    over the throne, the Tamil Land was with out any<br />    emperor, who can <br />    rule the big land mass. The warlords who existed<br />  in<br />    Pandya reign <br />    formed themsleves to be independent rulers of<br />  their<br />    places. similar <br />    to what the Chola warlords and generals have done,<br />    immediately after <br />    the destruction of the Chola Empire. Since there<br />  was<br />    no strong <br />    opposition, the nayaks invaded Tamil nadu. They<br />    where very careful <br />    that they didn't cross over the ways of those<br />  local<br />    Chieftains. After <br />    the invasion they established themselves as the<br />    rulers of Tamil <br />    Country, but their control was within the fortress<br />    and some areas <br />    around the fortress. They had to depend on the<br />    support of the local <br />    cheiftains. Infact the local cheiftains didn't pay<br />    any tribute to the <br />    Nayaks and the Maratha rulers, from start until<br />  the<br />    British rule. <br />    Even the Greatest King of Nayak Dynasty who took<br />  up<br />    wars until Mysore <br />    was unable to contain these local cheiftains and<br />    infact he even built <br />    a very storng and big fortress around Madura and<br />    Trichirapalli to <br />    safegaurd from the warlords.The region of Kallanai<br />    should also comes <br />    under the Local Chieftains, so the possibility<br />  that<br />    the Nayak kings <br />    would have build a dam was very less,as there were<br />    frequent fueds <br />    between the Nayak Kings and the local<br />    chieftains.Even if they had did <br />    so they could have built some more channels with<br />    boulders to split <br />    the water flow, nothing more than that.<br />      In saying the warlords and Chieftains, even the<br />    important Chola <br />    generals like the Mazhavarayar , Raajaleeyar,<br />    Paluvetaraiyar, <br />    Munaiyatharaiyar, Vallavaraiyar should have been<br />  the<br />    local <br />    chieftains. Infact in these Chola Areas one could<br />    still see people <br />    having their family names as Mazhavarayar ,<br />    Raajaleeyar, <br />    Paluvetaraiyar, Munaiyatharaiyar, Vallavaraiyar<br />    [Which were found in <br />    PS] and adding to it some like Eelanataraiyar,<br />    Thenkondaaar, Kalathil <br />    Vendraar, Chozhagar and many such family names.<br />  And<br />    these names are <br />    also to be found in inscriptions of Chola kings<br />  and<br />    been mentioned as <br />    the generals and cheiftains in the Chola Country.<br />  So<br />    they could be <br />    the local cheiftains in Chola Country who were<br />    called as independents <br />    during Nayaks rule as per British records.Even<br />    today, the people with <br />    such family names abound near Kallanai and other<br />    surrounding areas, <br />    thats why I feel some local cheiftain among them<br />    would have had the <br />    power over that area comprising kallanai. </p>

So<br />  they could be <br />  the local cheiftains in Chola Country who were<br />  called as independents <br />  during Nayaks rule as per British records.Even<br />  today, the people with <br />  such family names abound near Kallanai and other<br />  surrounding areas, <br />  thats why I feel some local cheiftain among them<br />  would have had the <br />  power over that area comprising kallanai. </p></blockquote>

        <p>Interesting issues discussed<br />But, Mr.Senthan Amudhan<br />Why you are comparing Karikalan.... with others?<br />He is from earlier Chola dynasty.... I think in 300 AD..... (I have <br />to check for correct year)<br />Kalanai is a great wonder, because it is the very OLD DAM (may be the <br />oldest dam in earth) .... <br />Jk<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, senthan amudan <senthana@y...  <br />wrote:</senthana@y...></p>

<p>  Regards<br />  Senthan Amudan</p>
<p>  1.Was the dam was actually built by Nayak kings while Karikalan <br />just strengthened the bunds?</p>
<p>  This question has to answered in a very detailed manner taking into <br />account of the nayaks rule <br />  and the local people over there at that time. After the Pandya <br />Kingdom was destroyed by maulikafur due to the Pandya brother's fued </p></blockquote>
<p>over the throne, the Tamil Land was with out any emperor, who can <br />rule the big land mass. The warlords who existed in Pandya reign <br />formed themsleves to be independent rulers of their places. similar <br />to what the Chola warlords and generals have done, immediately after <br />the destruction of the Chola Empire. Since there was no strong <br />opposition, the nayaks invaded Tamil nadu. They where very careful <br />that they didn't cross over the ways of those local Chieftains. After <br />the invasion they established themselves as the rulers of Tamil <br />Country, but their control was within the fortress and some areas <br />around the fortress. They had to depend on the support of the local <br />cheiftains. Infact the local cheiftains didn't pay any tribute to the <br />Nayaks and the Maratha rulers, from start until the British rule. <br />Even the Greatest King of Nayak Dynasty who took up wars until Mysore <br />was unable to contain these local cheiftains and infact he even built <br />a very storng and big fortress around Madura and Trichirapalli to <br />safegaurd from the warlords.The region of Kallanai should also comes <br />under the Local Chieftains, so the possibility that the Nayak kings <br />would have build a dam was very less,as there were frequent fueds <br />between the Nayak Kings and the local chieftains.Even if they had did <br />so they could have built some more channels with boulders to split <br />the water flow, nothing more than that.</p>
<blockquote><p>  In saying the warlords and Chieftains, even the important Chola <br />generals like the Mazhavarayar , Raajaleeyar, Paluvetaraiyar, </p></blockquote>
<p>Munaiyatharaiyar, Vallavaraiyar should have been the local <br />chieftains. Infact in these Chola Areas one could still see people <br />having their family names as Mazhavarayar , Raajaleeyar, <br />Paluvetaraiyar, Munaiyatharaiyar, Vallavaraiyar [Which were found in <br />PS] and adding to it some like Eelanataraiyar, Thenkondaaar, Kalathil <br />Vendraar, Chozhagar and many such family names. And these names are <br />also to be found in inscriptions of Chola kings and been mentioned as <br />the generals and cheiftains in the Chola Country. So they could be <br />the local cheiftains in Chola Country who were called as independents <br />during Nayaks rule as per British records.Even today, the people with <br />such family names abound near Kallanai and other surrounding areas, <br />thats why I feel some local cheiftain among them would have had the <br />power over that area comprising kallanai. </p>

<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>I hail from the banks of Vellaru (Southern boundary of Chozhas) (Pdkt) and <br />studied on the banks of Cauvery (Trichy). </p>
<p>After several years, now I see Cauvery at Trichy in its full "stream" <br />now .. exactly as Kalki described .. "Samudra raja kumaranai <br />thazhuvuvadarkku iru kaigalaiyim virithukkondu selvadhu pola .. " Cauvery <br />is flowing ... inspite of the obstructions of Krishnarajasagar &amp; <br />Bhavanisagar ..! and bifurcation of Kollidam at Mukkombu, about 15 Kms west <br />of Srirangam. </p>
<p>Imagine the same Cauvery during Karikalan's days - without concrete jungles <br />and hurdles ... should have been really furious... Karikalan should have <br />reinforced the BUNDs of Cauvery after Srirangam and managed the water- <br />flows into in-lands - between Srirangam and Thirukkandiyur / Thiruvayaru.</p>
<p>Kudavoil identified a coin in <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  Chennai .. depicting Tamil letters on one <br />side and a small mound with a recess and flow of water on other side .. and <br />explains (exclaims!) that such natural river bed-rock is located near Nemam <br />(Thirukkandiyur) even today !</acronym></p>
<p>"Ae Gouri" Vallam Kali Thalapuranam says Karikalan worshipped this Kali <br />before commencing works at Kallanai - but failed to record as inscriptions!</p>
<p>Your Thanjavur is always inspiring to think about &amp; write about..</p>

<p>Dear Gokul, Thanks for that.. </p>
<p>Member Kalpana Sruthi has filed Sundara Pandyan meykeerthi in our file <br />section narrating this..</p>
<p>Chozhas were experts in water management. </p>
<p>through a canal, which supplied and emptied water from nearby Sivaganga <br />Tank. Kamal has already posted a message on Rajrajan's Rain Water <br />Harvesting scheme in Big Temple! </p>
<p>A friend of mine has taken up Water management of Chozhas for his Doctorate <br />in Thanjai Tamil University - under the guidance of Dr. Kudavoil Balu. <br />Parantaka -I, used idle warriors to create Veeranam - as mentioned in <br />Ponniyin Selvan - which is much talked about even after 1200 yrs!</p>
<p>fondly, sps</p>

<p>The esalam and other copper plates which mention karikala as one of <br />the ancestors of cholas do not mention anything about kallanai. <br />Usually it is customery to record the grandest achievements of their <br />ancestors (sibi- sparrow, manu needhi - chariot etc)</p>

        <p>Dear Kamal<br />That is indeed shocking.....Every search says Karikalan built <br />kallanai they give various time frames frm 300BC to 2 CE</p>
<p>On what basis did they conclude tha karikalan did not built kallanai <br />clearly there must have been some evidence.</p>
<p>My understanding is there were no Meikeerthi or Seppedukkal...So all <br />we have is poetic scriptures what do they say....?</p>
<p>Second if they measured the chola land to device a ulagalanthan KOL <br />then there must be some mention of watersources and dams...<br />Is there any evidence?</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>This may be a shocking news. But fact.</p>
<p>Karikalan never built kallanai. Kaverikku iru puramum karai eduppiththaan.<br />That's all. Kallanai was constructed during Nayak period. That was very<br />small dam and today what we see is the expansion by british people. A<br />student of Jawaharlal nehru university did a Ph.D on Kallanai and proved<br />beyond any doubt that it was built by nayaks and subsequent expansions by<br />british people.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that Tamils did not have ability to construct dams.<br />Veerapandiyan constructed a dam across Kollidam river. There are<br />inscriptions stating this in Lalgudi temple. The word 'Anai' itself is used<br />in his inscription.</p>
