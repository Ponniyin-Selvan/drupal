</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>A "follow-up-note" on the Historical Study - on the years of<br />conquests of countries, listed in the Rajaraja Chola's Meikeerththi</p>
<p>In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate- "years of<br />conquests" of countries by RajarajaChola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />first made a Schedule of Inscriptions of Rajaraja - sequenced by their<br />respective years, for our study. Also I have provided a Summary on the</p>
<p>deductions made fromthe contents of these Inscriptions.<br />Rajaraja's expedition around Kalinga, and around Irattaipaadi are<br />provided below with further explanation.</p>
<p>Inscriptions</p>
<p>27 of 1906 from Thirukkadaiyur SII - XXII - 27</p>
<p>Meikeerththi includes - Kollam, Kalingam<br />- 16th year</p>
<p>AlsoThiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Vanga,</p>
<p>Magadha, Aratta, and Odda withKalingam</p>
<p>SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 ? 205</p>
<p>217 of 1894 from Thiruvaiyaaru, SII - V ? 516</p>
<p>Meikeerththi included - Irattaipaadi<br />-22nd year</p>
<p>Also an Inscription includes - Konkana 5 of 1895</p>
<p>EC ? 111 Sr 140</p>
<p>Also Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Sourashtra</p>
<p>with Irattaipaadi SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 - 205</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />part of this same year aseparate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />Orissa, which too was captured. Itappears it was in this same expedition<br />hecaptured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of West<br />Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered region<br />of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Fromthe Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates &amp; anInscription we note Rajaraja<br />Chola - 1 captured the regions of Irattaipaadi, Konkana, Sourashtra,<br />Kalingam, Odda, Magadha, Vanga&amp; Aratta among others.</p>
<p>Even though the conquests of the above countries in the north of India<br />are clearly indicated in the Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates, many<br />Historians have not discussed in respect of same in their writings. This<br />could possibly be in view - of their doubts on the authenticity of<br />these references to some countries of India, said to have been captured<br />by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>However we have further evidences toprove "that in fact" these<br />countries too have been won in warefareby Rajaraja Chola - 1, other than<br />the countries found in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>The references to the regions captured by Rajaraja in Karandai Thamil<br />SangamPlates are given as follows:</p>
<p>"?? Peruvaliyinai selvamaaka kondavanaana SeerRasarasan,<br />Singala, Pandiya, Keralaarasarkalaiyum, Kongesuvararkalaiyum,<br />Malavarkalaiyum, Thelungarkalaiyum, Gangarkalaiyum, Kalingarkalaiyum,<br />Vangarkalaiyum, Magadharkalaiyum, Chalukiya arasarkalaiyum, Kurunaattu<br />arasarkalaiyum, eanaiya ellaa arasarkalaiyum thoal valiyaal, poril<br />ventru (won in warfare), avarkaludaiya, yaanaikalaiyum,<br />kuthiraikalaiyum, naadukalaiyum, irraththinangalaiyum, selvangalaiyum,<br />kaippatrinaan??."</p>
<p>In the above reference, the countries that have been won in warefare<br />("poril ventru" in Tamil) by Rajaraja Chola - 1, there are three<br />new regions mentioned that are not found in the Thiruvaalangkadu Copper<br />plates. One is the region of the Chalukiya-arasar which we are aware was<br />the Irrataipaadi Elaraiilakkam of the Meikeerththi,and the other two<br />being the Malavar and Kurunaatu arasar.</p>
<p>Malavar (Malava) were a dynasty which was in existance in the north of<br />Maharashtra. It appears that Rajaraja's forces even won over the<br />Bhojas of Malava. There is a referance in this Karandai Thamil Sangam<br />Plates which confirms same as"?..(Rajaraja)?.. Bhojadevan<br />udauya thalaiyai thuniththaan??".</p>
<p>Also a correction has to be made on my previous articlewherin I had<br />mentioned the south Saurashtra was in north Maharashtra. But in the face<br />of more evidence it has to be correctly located in Gujarat. The<br />Kuru-naatu arasar needs further investigation and confirmation on its<br />precise location.</p>
<p>Now on investigating the contents of the Essaalam Copper Plates we have<br />the list of countries conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1stated as follows:</p>
<p>"???Arumolivarman who with his long and beautiful arms (that)<br />bored the marks of sankhu andchakra in his palms. He conquered the<br />Gangas, Vangas, Kalingas, Magadhas, Malavas, Simhalas, Andhras, Rattas,<br />Oddas, Katakas, Keralas, Gaudas and Pandiyas. By the wealth obtained<br />through his conquests he erected at Thanjapuri a very great temple named<br />Rajarajaesvarem??."</p>
<p>Odda, and the new region Gauda are mentioned again as regions conquered<br />by Rajaraja Chola ? 1 in the Esaalam Copper Plates. "Gauda Desa<br />encompassed parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh".</p>
<p>mentioned in three Copper Plate Grants.Malavas are mentioned in two<br />Copper Plate Grants</p>
<p>Rattas, Oddas too are mentioned in two Copper Plate Grants and Gauda<br />only in one Copper Plate Grant.</p>
<p>Also another correction has to be now made on my previous article wherin<br />I had mentioned the Aratta (as appearing in Thiruvaalankadu Copper<br />Plates) was in West Bengal along with Vanga. But in the face of more<br />evidence it has to be taken correctly as the short form of Irattaipaadi.<br />This same region is mentioned in Essaalam Copper Plates as Rattas and in<br />Karandai Thamil Sangham Plates as Chalukiyaregion.</p>
<p>Hence we can safely conclude that in addition to the countries found in<br />Rajaraja'sMeikeerththi, the regions of Magadha, Vanga, Odda, and<br />Gauda, (inthe north-east India), and Saurashtra, Malava and Konkana (in<br />the north-west) were conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>Then the question may be asked as to why the above regions are not<br />included in Rajaraja's Meikeerththi. The only explanation we can<br />give "for the time being" is as follows:</p>
<p>It could have been a possibillity that during the period of<br />Rajaraja's invasion of Irattaipaadi ? the king of Irattaipaadi<br />was already in authority also over Saurashtra, Malava, and Konkana -<br />being it's neighbouring regions. It appears that these three regions<br />too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />Irattaipaadi,but only the region Irattaipaadi Elarai Illakkam however<br />was mentioned in the Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>Likewise during the period of Rajaraja'sinvasion of Kalinga - the<br />king of Kalinga was already in authority also over Magadha, Vanga,<br />Gauda, and Odda - being its neighbouring regions. It appears that these<br />four regions too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />Kalinga, but onlythe region Kalinga however was mentioned in the<br />Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>Thisis an inferance only, and an indepth study on same is necessary<br />along with the study of the History of the above mentioned regions of<br />this period, to acertain whether this could have been the possible<br />reason for these regions - of not having been mentioned in the<br />Rajaraja's Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>The End</p>

The reason maybe those days there<br />couldnt have been a sea / sea battle. meaning, two ships at war. basic<br />need would be archers on ships with trained seamen to navigate. But<br />for their campaigns in lanka and incl the raids on srivijaya - most<br />possibly they would have depended on merchat ships for transport - and<br />basically standing army to land and fight. So coming back to the<br />question - did cholas have a standing navy?? </p>

<p>Dear Mr Sivapathasekaran,</p>
<p>An "extract" from my Thread in Mayyam.com which I trust is of much<br />interest to you.  </p>
<p>".....The first Prime Minister of India - Late Hon' Jawarhalal Nehru<br />had clearly acknowledged the - greatness of the Medieval Cholas in the<br />Indian History - and has stated in his book titled "Glimpses of the<br />World History that - "the Chola Empire grew to power, and about the<br />middle of the nineth century it dominated the south. It was a<br />Sea-Power and had a big Navy, with which it swept the Bay of Bengal<br />and the Arabian Sea.......The Chola Empire thus became very extensive<br />the biggest since the days of the Guptas.....Apart from their success<br />in war, the Cholas were long famous for their sea-trade". (page 126-127)</p>
<p>The North Indian Historian A.L.Basham speaks of the formidable<br />position of Cholas in the middle ages in his book titled "Wander that<br />was India" and states "The Chola Empire was one of the mightiest<br />military powers to arise in South and South-East Asia in the medieval<br />period. The Imperial Cholas were the only seafareing power to dominate<br />the Indian Ocean, and the greater part of it's littoral before modern<br />times. The Imperial Cholas were the only rulers in South Asia before<br />the British who can be credited with having a navy in the modern sense<br />of the term". (page 75)</p>
<p>Measuring their greatness achieved in all fields, a non-Tamil<br />Historian correctly and justifiably referred to the Cholas especialy<br />to Rajaraja Chola - 1 and Rajendra Chola - 1 in his book titled<br />"Currents of South-East Asian History" as "kings of World stature"....'</p>
<p>Also reminding of the words from Rajendra's Meikeerththi referring to<br />the Chola Naval expedition which is,</p>
<p>"Alai kadal naduvil pala Kalam seluththi...."</p>
<p>"....sending 'many Ships' in the centre of the ocean with waves...."</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Virarajendra </p></sps10142004@...></p>

<p>It is a very fascinating idea.<br />To accurately answer it, ( it may very well be true ),<br />The problem to be assessed, [independently of these writings ] can<br />be asked as<br />a) In all India's long History,<br />which Emperors have been classified by someone(at sometime) as ruling<br />a large portion of "INDIA-LAND" [ Baaarathavarsha]<br />b) what was(were) their territorial size, <br />c) then compare and evaluate.</p>
<p>My comments are:--</p>
<p>Emperor Asoka [ 'the Great' ] ruled a territory from modern Pakistan<br />[and possibly Afghanistan] to modern Bangladesh, and towards the South<br />, the whole of the Deccan, but clearly excluding the Tamil Lands.<br />[<br />Emperor Akbar and Harsha ruled very large areas,[ but excluding <br />probably modern Afghanistan,] including the Gangetic plain, and<br />westerly towards the Ganges delta-- Both did not rule south of the Deccan.</p>

<p>    A "follow-up-note" on the Historical Study - on the years of<br />    conquests of countries, listed in the Rajaraja Chola's Meikeerththi</p>
<p>    In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate- "years of<br />    conquests" of countries by RajarajaChola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />    first made a Schedule of Inscriptions of Rajaraja - sequenced by their<br />    respective years, for our study. Also I have provided a Summary on the</p>
<p>    deductions made fromthe contents of these Inscriptions.<br />    Rajaraja's expedition around Kalinga, and around Irattaipaadi are<br />    provided below with further explanation.</p>
<p>    Inscriptions</p>
<p>    27 of 1906 from Thirukkadaiyur SII - XXII - 27</p>
<p>    Meikeerththi includes - Kollam, Kalingam<br />    - 16th year</p>
<p>    AlsoThiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Vanga,</p>
<p>    Magadha, Aratta, and Odda withKalingam</p>
<p>    SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 ? 205</p>
<p>    217 of 1894 from Thiruvaiyaaru, SII - V ? 516</p>
<p>    Meikeerththi included - Irattaipaadi<br />    -22nd year</p>
<p>    Also an Inscription includes - Konkana 5 of 1895</p>
<p>    EC ? 111 Sr 140</p>
<p>    Also Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Sourashtra</p>
<p>    with Irattaipaadi SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 - 205</p>
<p>    Summary</p>
<p>    In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />    sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />    part of this same year aseparate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />    Orissa, which too was captured. Itappears it was in this same<br />expedition<br />    hecaptured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of West<br />    Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered region<br />    of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>    ----------------</p>
<p>    Fromthe Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates &amp; anInscription we note Rajaraja<br />    Chola - 1 captured the regions of Irattaipaadi, Konkana, Sourashtra,<br />    Kalingam, Odda, Magadha, Vanga&amp; Aratta among others.</p>
<p>    Even though the conquests of the above countries in the north of India<br />    are clearly indicated in the Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates, many<br />    Historians have not discussed in respect of same in their<br />writings. This<br />    could possibly be in view - of their doubts on the authenticity of<br />    these references to some countries of India, said to have been<br />captured<br />    by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>    However we have further evidences toprove "that in fact" these<br />    countries too have been won in warefareby Rajaraja Chola - 1,<br />other than<br />    the countries found in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>    The references to the regions captured by Rajaraja in Karandai Thamil<br />    SangamPlates are given as follows:</p>
<p>    "?? Peruvaliyinai selvamaaka kondavanaana SeerRasarasan,<br />    Singala, Pandiya, Keralaarasarkalaiyum, Kongesuvararkalaiyum,<br />    Malavarkalaiyum, Thelungarkalaiyum, Gangarkalaiyum, Kalingarkalaiyum,<br />    Vangarkalaiyum, Magadharkalaiyum, Chalukiya arasarkalaiyum, Kurunaattu<br />    arasarkalaiyum, eanaiya ellaa arasarkalaiyum thoal valiyaal, poril<br />    ventru (won in warfare), avarkaludaiya, yaanaikalaiyum,<br />    kuthiraikalaiyum, naadukalaiyum, irraththinangalaiyum, selvangalaiyum,<br />    kaippatrinaan??."</p>
<p>    In the above reference, the countries that have been won in warefare<br />    ("poril ventru" in Tamil) by Rajaraja Chola - 1, there are three<br />    new regions mentioned that are not found in the Thiruvaalangkadu<br />Copper<br />    plates. One is the region of the Chalukiya-arasar which we are<br />aware was<br />    the Irrataipaadi Elaraiilakkam of the Meikeerththi,and the other two<br />    being the Malavar and Kurunaatu arasar.</p>
<p>    Malavar (Malava) were a dynasty which was in existance in the north of<br />    Maharashtra. It appears that Rajaraja's forces even won over the<br />    Bhojas of Malava. There is a referance in this Karandai Thamil Sangam<br />    Plates which confirms same as"?..(Rajaraja)?.. Bhojadevan<br />    udauya thalaiyai thuniththaan??".</p>
<p>    Also a correction has to be made on my previous articlewherin I had<br />    mentioned the south Saurashtra was in north Maharashtra. But in<br />the face<br />    of more evidence it has to be correctly located in Gujarat. The<br />    Kuru-naatu arasar needs further investigation and confirmation on its<br />    precise location.</p>
<p>    Now on investigating the contents of the Essaalam Copper Plates we<br />have<br />    the list of countries conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1stated as<br />follows:</p>
<p>    "???Arumolivarman who with his long and beautiful arms (that)<br />    bored the marks of sankhu andchakra in his palms. He conquered the<br />    Gangas, Vangas, Kalingas, Magadhas, Malavas, Simhalas, Andhras,<br />Rattas,<br />    Oddas, Katakas, Keralas, Gaudas and Pandiyas. By the wealth obtained<br />    through his conquests he erected at Thanjapuri a very great temple<br />named<br />    Rajarajaesvarem??."</p>
<p>    Odda, and the new region Gauda are mentioned again as regions<br />conquered<br />    by Rajaraja Chola ? 1 in the Esaalam Copper Plates. "Gauda Desa<br />    encompassed parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh".</p>
<p>    mentioned in three Copper Plate Grants.Malavas are mentioned in two<br />    Copper Plate Grants</p>
<p>    Rattas, Oddas too are mentioned in two Copper Plate Grants and Gauda<br />    only in one Copper Plate Grant.</p>
<p>    Also another correction has to be now made on my previous article<br />wherin<br />    I had mentioned the Aratta (as appearing in Thiruvaalankadu Copper<br />    Plates) was in West Bengal along with Vanga. But in the face of more<br />    evidence it has to be taken correctly as the short form of<br />Irattaipaadi.<br />    This same region is mentioned in Essaalam Copper Plates as Rattas<br />and in<br />    Karandai Thamil Sangham Plates as Chalukiyaregion.</p>
<p>    Hence we can safely conclude that in addition to the countries<br />found in<br />    Rajaraja'sMeikeerththi, the regions of Magadha, Vanga, Odda, and<br />    Gauda, (inthe north-east India), and Saurashtra, Malava and<br />Konkana (in<br />    the north-west) were conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>    Then the question may be asked as to why the above regions are not<br />    included in Rajaraja's Meikeerththi. The only explanation we can<br />    give "for the time being" is as follows:</p>
<p>    It could have been a possibillity that during the period of<br />    Rajaraja's invasion of Irattaipaadi ? the king of Irattaipaadi<br />    was already in authority also over Saurashtra, Malava, and Konkana -<br />    being it's neighbouring regions. It appears that these three regions<br />    too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />    Irattaipaadi,but only the region Irattaipaadi Elarai Illakkam however<br />    was mentioned in the Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>    Likewise during the period of Rajaraja'sinvasion of Kalinga - the<br />    king of Kalinga was already in authority also over Magadha, Vanga,<br />    Gauda, and Odda - being its neighbouring regions. It appears that<br />these<br />    four regions too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />    Kalinga, but onlythe region Kalinga however was mentioned in the<br />    Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>    Thisis an inferance only, and an indepth study on same is necessary<br />    along with the study of the History of the above mentioned regions of<br />    this period, to acertain whether this could have been the possible<br />    reason for these regions - of not having been mentioned in the<br />    Rajaraja's Meikeerththi.</p>

<p>But just a little bit later the downfall of Srivijaya began.It was<br />triggered by attackers of the idian Chola-Kingdom, which didn?t try to<br />conquer Srivijaya, but to weaken it as an opponent in trading.</p>

<p>Kedah is now known for remains of Indian architecture at the Bujang<br />Valley. This was due to the invasion by the Chola kingdom from South<br />India an invasion which ultimately led to the fall of Srivijaya. How<br />did this happen?</p>
<p>In the 11th century, the south Indian Tamil kingdom of Chola launched<br />an attack on Srivijaya, systematically plundering the Srivijayan ports<br />along the Straits of Malacca, and even captured the Srivijayan king in<br />Palembang. The reasons for this change in relations between Srivijaya<br />and the Cholas are unknown, although it is theorised that plunder made<br />up an essential part of the Chola political economy. While it seemed<br />that the Cholas only intended to plunder Srivijaya, they left a<br />lasting presence on Kataha, the remains of which are still visible at<br />the Bujang Valley archaeological museum.</p>
<p>The successful sack and plunder of Srivijaya had left it in a severely<br />weakened state that marked the beginning of the end of Srivijaya.<br />Having lost its wealth and prestige from the Chola attack, the port<br />cities of the region started to initiate direct trade with China,<br />shrugging off the exclusive influence Srivijaya once held over them.<br />Towards the end of Srivijaya`s influence, the power centre of<br />Srivijaya began to oscillate between Palembang and neighbouring Jambi,<br />further fragmenting the once-great empire. Other factors included<br />Javanese invasion westwards toward Sumatra in 1275, invading the<br />Malayu kingdoms. Later towards the end of the 13th century, the Thai<br />polities from the north came down the peninsula and conquered the last<br />of the Srivijayan vassals.</p>

<p>the mahavamsa quotes the invasion of the cholas. so the argument is <br />complete.</p>
<p>what may be helpful is for you to list the present states that were <br />conquered by rrc and rjac.<br />then we need to look into the same periods of history for kingdoms <br />existed there and check for counter points.<br />for example bengal.<br />who was ruling bengal when rrc conquered. was there any distubance ?</p>

<p>    A "follow-up-note" on the Historical Study - on the years of<br />    conquests of countries, listed in the Rajaraja Chola's <br />Meikeerththi</p>
<p>    In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate- "years of<br />    conquests" of countries by RajarajaChola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />    first made a Schedule of Inscriptions of Rajaraja - sequenced by <br />their<br />    respective years, for our study. Also I have provided a Summary <br />on the</p>
<p>    deductions made fromthe contents of these Inscriptions.<br />    Rajaraja's expedition around Kalinga, and around Irattaipaadi are<br />    provided below with further explanation.</p>
<p>    Inscriptions</p>
<p>    27 of 1906 from Thirukkadaiyur SII - XXII - 27</p>
<p>    Meikeerththi includes - Kollam, Kalingam<br />    - 16th year</p>
<p>    AlsoThiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Vanga,</p>
<p>    Magadha, Aratta, and Odda withKalingam</p>
<p>    SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 ? 205</p>
<p>    217 of 1894 from Thiruvaiyaaru, SII - V ? 516</p>
<p>    Meikeerththi included - Irattaipaadi<br />    -22nd year</p>
<p>    Also an Inscription includes - Konkana 5 of 1895</p>
<p>    EC ? 111 Sr 140</p>
<p>    Also Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Sourashtra</p>
<p>    with Irattaipaadi SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 - 205</p>
<p>    Summary</p>
<p>    In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] <br />he<br />    sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the <br />second<br />    part of this same year aseparate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />    Orissa, which too was captured. Itappears it was in this same <br />expedition<br />    hecaptured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of <br />West<br />    Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered <br />region<br />    of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>    ----------------</p>
<p>    Fromthe Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates &amp; anInscription we note <br />Rajaraja<br />    Chola - 1 captured the regions of Irattaipaadi, Konkana, <br />Sourashtra,<br />    Kalingam, Odda, Magadha, Vanga&amp; Aratta among others.</p>
<p>    Even though the conquests of the above countries in the north of <br />India<br />    are clearly indicated in the Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates, many<br />    Historians have not discussed in respect of same in their <br />writings. This<br />    could possibly be in view - of their doubts on the authenticity  <br />of<br />    these references to some countries of India, said to have been <br />captured<br />    by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>    However we have further evidences toprove "that in fact" these<br />    countries too have been won in warefareby Rajaraja Chola - 1, <br />other than<br />    the countries found in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>    The references to the regions captured by Rajaraja in Karandai <br />Thamil<br />    SangamPlates are given as follows:</p>
<p>    "?? Peruvaliyinai selvamaaka kondavanaana SeerRasarasan,<br />    Singala, Pandiya, Keralaarasarkalaiyum, Kongesuvararkalaiyum,<br />    Malavarkalaiyum, Thelungarkalaiyum, Gangarkalaiyum, <br />Kalingarkalaiyum,<br />    Vangarkalaiyum, Magadharkalaiyum, Chalukiya arasarkalaiyum, <br />Kurunaattu<br />    arasarkalaiyum, eanaiya ellaa arasarkalaiyum thoal valiyaal, poril<br />    ventru (won in warfare), avarkaludaiya, yaanaikalaiyum,<br />    kuthiraikalaiyum, naadukalaiyum, irraththinangalaiyum, <br />selvangalaiyum,<br />    kaippatrinaan??."</p>
<p>    In the above reference, the countries that have been won in <br />warefare<br />    ("poril ventru" in Tamil) by Rajaraja Chola - 1, there are three<br />    new regions mentioned that are not found in the Thiruvaalangkadu <br />Copper<br />    plates. One is the region of the Chalukiya-arasar which we are <br />aware was<br />    the Irrataipaadi Elaraiilakkam of the Meikeerththi,and the other <br />two<br />    being the Malavar and Kurunaatu arasar.</p>
<p>    Malavar (Malava) were a dynasty which was in existance in the <br />north of<br />    Maharashtra. It appears that Rajaraja's forces even won over the<br />    Bhojas of Malava. There is a referance in this Karandai Thamil <br />Sangam<br />    Plates which confirms same as"?..(Rajaraja)?.. Bhojadevan<br />    udauya thalaiyai thuniththaan??".</p>
<p>    Also a correction has to be made on my previous articlewherin I <br />had<br />    mentioned the south Saurashtra was in north Maharashtra. But in <br />the face<br />    of more evidence it has to be correctly located in Gujarat. The<br />    Kuru-naatu arasar needs further investigation and confirmation on <br />its<br />    precise location.</p>
<p>    Now on investigating the contents of the Essaalam Copper Plates <br />we have<br />    the list of countries conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1stated as <br />follows:</p>
<p>    "???Arumolivarman who with his long and beautiful arms (that)<br />    bored the marks of sankhu andchakra in his palms. He conquered the<br />    Gangas, Vangas, Kalingas, Magadhas, Malavas, Simhalas, Andhras, <br />Rattas,<br />    Oddas, Katakas, Keralas, Gaudas and Pandiyas. By the wealth <br />obtained<br />    through his conquests he erected at Thanjapuri a very great <br />temple named<br />    Rajarajaesvarem??."</p>
<p>Rattaand<br />    Odda, and the new region Gauda are mentioned again as regions <br />conquered<br />    by Rajaraja Chola ? 1 in the Esaalam Copper Plates. "Gauda Desa<br />    encompassed parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh".</p>
<p>    mentioned in three Copper Plate Grants.Malavas are mentioned in <br />two<br />    Copper Plate Grants</p>
<p>    Rattas, Oddas too are mentioned in two Copper Plate Grants and <br />Gauda<br />    only in one Copper Plate Grant.</p>
<p>    Also another correction has to be now made on my previous article <br />wherin<br />    I had mentioned the Aratta (as appearing in Thiruvaalankadu Copper<br />    Plates) was in West Bengal along with Vanga. But in the face of <br />more<br />    evidence it has to be taken correctly as the short form of <br />Irattaipaadi.<br />    This same region is mentioned in Essaalam Copper Plates as Rattas <br />and in<br />    Karandai Thamil Sangham Plates as Chalukiyaregion.</p>
<p>    Hence we can safely conclude that in addition to the countries <br />found in<br />    Rajaraja'sMeikeerththi, the regions of Magadha, Vanga, Odda, and<br />    Gauda, (inthe north-east India), and Saurashtra, Malava and <br />Konkana (in<br />    the north-west) were conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>    Then the question may be asked as to why the above regions are not<br />    included in Rajaraja's Meikeerththi. The only explanation we can<br />    give "for the time being" is as follows:</p>
<p>    It could have been a possibillity that during the period of<br />    Rajaraja's invasion of Irattaipaadi ? the king of Irattaipaadi<br />    was already in authority also over Saurashtra, Malava, and <br />Konkana -<br />    being it's neighbouring regions. It appears that these three <br />regions<br />    too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />    Irattaipaadi,but only the region Irattaipaadi Elarai Illakkam <br />however<br />    was mentioned in the Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>    Likewise during the period of Rajaraja'sinvasion of Kalinga - the<br />    king of Kalinga was already in authority also over Magadha, Vanga,<br />    Gauda, and Odda - being its neighbouring regions. It appears that <br />these<br />    four regions too came under Cholas automatically when he <br />conquered the<br />    Kalinga, but onlythe region Kalinga however was mentioned in the<br />    Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>    Thisis an inferance only, and an indepth study on same is <br />necessary<br />    along with the study of the History of the above mentioned <br />regions of<br />    this period, to acertain whether this could have been the possible<br />    reason for these regions - of not having been mentioned in the<br />    Rajaraja's Meikeerththi.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear R.Venkatesh,</p>
<p>In your Message No: 28338 you have queried as follows:</p>
<p>----------</p>
<blockquote><p>  "Rajaraja Cholan - 1" (A.D.985-1014) - one among the two 'Greatest<br />  Rulers' of Tamil Nadu, -- who conquered 3/5 of India,</p></blockquote>
<p>----------</p>
<p>60%??? we should have records to prove this.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>The "strength of evidences" on which I based my conclusions and stated<br />as "Rajaraja....who conquered 3/5 of India" is clearly given in this<br />"follow-up-note" Thread. It should be noted the Copper Plate Grants<br />under reference were engraved with the Grants ordered by Rajendra<br />Chola himself, and the "Sasana" were written by the Engravers after<br />the contents were attested by responsible Officers of Rajendra Chola.<br />So can we doubt the authenticity of the information - of the<br />"countries" referred "as captured by Rajaraja Chola" in these Copper<br />Plates ?????, which are over and above the number of countries<br />mentioned in his Meikeerththi. </p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>  A "follow-up-note" on the Historical Study - on the years of<br />  conquests of countries, listed in the Rajaraja Chola's Meikeerththi</p>
<p>  In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate- "years of<br />  conquests" of countries by RajarajaChola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />  first made a Schedule of Inscriptions of Rajaraja - sequenced by their<br />  respective years, for our study. Also I have provided a Summary on the</p>
<p>  deductions made fromthe contents of these Inscriptions.<br />  Rajaraja's expedition around Kalinga, and around Irattaipaadi are<br />  provided below with further explanation.</p>
<p>  Inscriptions</p>
<p>  27 of 1906 from Thirukkadaiyur SII - XXII - 27</p>
<p>  Meikeerththi includes - Kollam, Kalingam<br />  - 16th year</p>
<p>  AlsoThiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Vanga,</p>
<p>  Magadha, Aratta, and Odda withKalingam</p>
<p>  SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 ? 205</p>
<p>  217 of 1894 from Thiruvaiyaaru, SII - V ? 516</p>
<p>  Meikeerththi included - Irattaipaadi<br />  -22nd year</p>
<p>  Also an Inscription includes - Konkana 5 of 1895</p>
<p>  EC ? 111 Sr 140</p>
<p>  Also Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Sourashtra</p>
<p>  with Irattaipaadi SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 - 205</p>
<p>  Summary</p>
<p>  In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />  sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />  part of this same year aseparate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />  Orissa, which too was captured. Itappears it was in this same expedition<br />  hecaptured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of West<br />  Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered region<br />  of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>  ----------------</p>
<p>  Fromthe Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates &amp; anInscription we note Rajaraja<br />  Chola - 1 captured the regions of Irattaipaadi, Konkana, Sourashtra,<br />  Kalingam, Odda, Magadha, Vanga&amp; Aratta among others.</p>
<p>  Even though the conquests of the above countries in the north of India<br />  are clearly indicated in the Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates, many<br />  Historians have not discussed in respect of same in their writings. This<br />  could possibly be in view - of their doubts on the authenticity of<br />  these references to some countries of India, said to have been captured<br />  by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>  However we have further evidences toprove "that in fact" these<br />  countries too have been won in warefareby Rajaraja Chola - 1, other than<br />  the countries found in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>  The references to the regions captured by Rajaraja in Karandai Thamil<br />  SangamPlates are given as follows:</p>
<p>  "?? Peruvaliyinai selvamaaka kondavanaana SeerRasarasan,<br />  Singala, Pandiya, Keralaarasarkalaiyum, Kongesuvararkalaiyum,<br />  Malavarkalaiyum, Thelungarkalaiyum, Gangarkalaiyum, Kalingarkalaiyum,<br />  Vangarkalaiyum, Magadharkalaiyum, Chalukiya arasarkalaiyum, Kurunaattu<br />  arasarkalaiyum, eanaiya ellaa arasarkalaiyum thoal valiyaal, poril<br />  ventru (won in warfare), avarkaludaiya, yaanaikalaiyum,<br />  kuthiraikalaiyum, naadukalaiyum, irraththinangalaiyum, selvangalaiyum,<br />  kaippatrinaan??."</p>
<p>  In the above reference, the countries that have been won in warefare<br />  ("poril ventru" in Tamil) by Rajaraja Chola - 1, there are three<br />  new regions mentioned that are not found in the Thiruvaalangkadu Copper<br />  plates. One is the region of the Chalukiya-arasar which we are aware was<br />  the Irrataipaadi Elaraiilakkam of the Meikeerththi,and the other two<br />  being the Malavar and Kurunaatu arasar.</p>
<p>  Malavar (Malava) were a dynasty which was in existance in the north of<br />  Maharashtra. It appears that Rajaraja's forces even won over the<br />  Bhojas of Malava. There is a referance in this Karandai Thamil Sangam<br />  Plates which confirms same as"?..(Rajaraja)?.. Bhojadevan<br />  udauya thalaiyai thuniththaan??".</p>
<p>  Also a correction has to be made on my previous articlewherin I had<br />  mentioned the south Saurashtra was in north Maharashtra. But in the face<br />  of more evidence it has to be correctly located in Gujarat. The<br />  Kuru-naatu arasar needs further investigation and confirmation on its<br />  precise location.</p>
<p>  Now on investigating the contents of the Essaalam Copper Plates we have<br />  the list of countries conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1stated as follows:</p>
<p>  "???Arumolivarman who with his long and beautiful arms (that)<br />  bored the marks of sankhu andchakra in his palms. He conquered the<br />  Gangas, Vangas, Kalingas, Magadhas, Malavas, Simhalas, Andhras, Rattas,<br />  Oddas, Katakas, Keralas, Gaudas and Pandiyas. By the wealth obtained<br />  through his conquests he erected at Thanjapuri a very great temple named<br />  Rajarajaesvarem??."</p>
<p>  Odda, and the new region Gauda are mentioned again as regions conquered<br />  by Rajaraja Chola ? 1 in the Esaalam Copper Plates. "Gauda Desa<br />  encompassed parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh".</p>
<p>  mentioned in three Copper Plate Grants.Malavas are mentioned in two<br />  Copper Plate Grants</p>
<p>  Rattas, Oddas too are mentioned in two Copper Plate Grants and Gauda<br />  only in one Copper Plate Grant.</p>
<p>  Also another correction has to be now made on my previous article wherin<br />  I had mentioned the Aratta (as appearing in Thiruvaalankadu Copper<br />  Plates) was in West Bengal along with Vanga. But in the face of more<br />  evidence it has to be taken correctly as the short form of Irattaipaadi.<br />  This same region is mentioned in Essaalam Copper Plates as Rattas and in<br />  Karandai Thamil Sangham Plates as Chalukiyaregion.</p>
<p>  Hence we can safely conclude that in addition to the countries found in<br />  Rajaraja'sMeikeerththi, the regions of Magadha, Vanga, Odda, and<br />  Gauda, (inthe north-east India), and Saurashtra, Malava and Konkana (in<br />  the north-west) were conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>  Then the question may be asked as to why the above regions are not<br />  included in Rajaraja's Meikeerththi. The only explanation we can<br />  give "for the time being" is as follows:</p>
<p>  It could have been a possibillity that during the period of<br />  Rajaraja's invasion of Irattaipaadi ? the king of Irattaipaadi<br />  was already in authority also over Saurashtra, Malava, and Konkana -<br />  being it's neighbouring regions. It appears that these three regions<br />  too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />  Irattaipaadi,but only the region Irattaipaadi Elarai Illakkam however<br />  was mentioned in the Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>  Likewise during the period of Rajaraja'sinvasion of Kalinga - the<br />  king of Kalinga was already in authority also over Magadha, Vanga,<br />  Gauda, and Odda - being its neighbouring regions. It appears that these<br />  four regions too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />  Kalinga, but onlythe region Kalinga however was mentioned in the<br />  Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>  Thisis an inferance only, and an indepth study on same is necessary<br />  along with the study of the History of the above mentioned regions of<br />  this period, to acertain whether this could have been the possible<br />  reason for these regions - of not having been mentioned in the<br />  Rajaraja's Meikeerththi.</p>
