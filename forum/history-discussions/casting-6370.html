</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear friends,<br />I realize that this is a 'Kalki' site, but would it interest anyone to<br />'cast' the Mahabharata with International actors/actresses?</p>
<p>I'm sure that the Peter Brook version is extremely controversial,<br />but I found it fascinating: all the various ethnic groups he<br />included to make it a truly global Epic.</p>
<p>He had an Israeli play Krishna; an African American: Karna; Spaniard: Yudhishthara; a Japanese actress for Gandhari; forget who played the twins. Anyway, I was really absorbed,<br />tho some were not the way my imagination had pictured them.<br />I'm pretty old so have seen lots of Western actors over the years.</p>
<p>How's this [I'm sure you won't have heard of all of these. . .]<br />Karna = Richard Burton<br />Yudhisthira = Max von Sydow<br />Bhima = Toshiro Mifune<br />Nakula &amp; Sahadeva = Oscar Werner, twice<br />Duryodhana = Laurence Olivier [when under 50]<br />Dhritarashtra = Paul Schofield<br />Gandhari = Helen Mirren<br />Krishna = Terence Stamp, at 25<br />Arjuna = Robert Redford<br />Dushasena = Conrad Veidt<br />{or he could be Sakuni}<br />Bhishma = Alec Guinness<br />Kripa = Clint Eastwood<br />Drona = Jean Gabin<br />Kunti = Simone Signoret<br />Draupadi = Nargis in her heyday<br />Abhimanyu = Leonardo di Caprio</p>

<p>     Dear Kathie, RKN himself was a very modest man and actually <br />a<br />     champion of simplicity and modesty. Did your video not have <br />subtitles, am<br />     surprised because mine did and I bought it on Amazon too.</p>
<p>     Actually RKN had a very bad experience selling his Guide to <br />movie makers<br />     up north and he refused to part with the rights of Malgudi Days <br />for a very<br />     long time. Finally he said he would watch one episode pilot and <br />go with the<br />     rest if he was happy. He ended up being really happy and <br />satisfied with the<br />     result. There is only a short two disc version available on <br />video (as far as<br />     I know). Swami and Friends and Vendor of Sweets are not yet <br />released and<br />     they are really good too.</p>

<p>     Dear Madan, The Narayan books are among my favorites. I<br />     once knew his editor at Viking, socially, a very<br />     modest man.<br />     Kathie</p>

<p>     Kathie, if you are worried about the subtitiles, you should <br />stick to the<br />     original english version of the books. As usual, the book is <br />better than the<br />     videos.

<p>   Dear Kathie, RKN himself was a very modest man and actually a<br />   champion of simplicity and modesty. Did your video not have subtitles, am<br />   surprised because mine did and I bought it on Amazon too.</p>
<p>   Actually RKN had a very bad experience selling his Guide to movie makers<br />   up north and he refused to part with the rights of Malgudi Days for a very<br />   long time. Finally he said he would watch one episode pilot and go with the<br />   rest if he was happy. He ended up being really happy and satisfied with the<br />   result. There is only a short two disc version available on video (as far as<br />   I know). Swami and Friends and Vendor of Sweets are not yet released and<br />   they are really good too.</p>

        <p>Absolutely..RKN writes of it in his My Days, when flamboyant Dev Anand walked into his home in Mysore and gave him a blank cheque in return for story rights of Guide. RKN refused saying his only request was that the story be made as is with no alterations - which of course was not respected. He tooka paltry sum of 2000/- in return for the rights of the movie. Dev Anand later even said in his bio that he had never seen anyone refuse a blank cheque like? that before.</p>

<p>  Kathie, if you are worried about the subtitiles, you should stick to the<br />  original english version of the books. As usual, the book is better than the<br />  videos. But I should admit malgudi days is one of the few dramatizations<br />  that succeed in being close to the book as possible (the video has most of<br />  the dialogues word for word from the book) - but that may also be because I<br />  saw the videos first ;)</p>

<p>Kathie, if you are worried about the subtitiles, you should stick to the original english version of the books. As usual, the book is better than the videos. But I should admit malgudi days is one of the few dramatizations that succeed in being close to the book as possible (the video has most of the dialogues word for word from the book) - but that may also be because I saw the videos first ;)</p>

        <p>A few months back I watched a couple of episodes of Malgudi daysin<br />youtube. I was so thrilled and jumping in joy that my wife was taken<br />aback and asked me why do you get so excited. I told her such things<br />cannot be explained but you have to experience it. :)</p>

<p>This link provides a overview of the chronology of Mahabaratha. Not<br />sure about its authenticity. Just look at the count of Army<br />participated in the war. this is what I mentioned in one of my earlier<br />threads that the population was too much and war was the only way for<br />krishna to control the population, though everyone said he could have<br />prevented the war. </p>

<p>  Kathie, if you are worried about the subtitiles, you should stick to <br />  the original english version of the books. As usual, the book is <br />  better than the videos. But I should admit malgudi days is one of <br />  the few dramatizations that succeed in being close to the book as <br />  possible (the video has most of the dialogues word for word from the <br />  book) - but that may also be because I saw the videos first ;)</p>

        <p>Dear Kathi, I have seen the Brook version. I didn't think it was controversial as much it was ..er.. boring. I mean perhaps i have to read his lyrics and then see the drama. But by itself I didn't find it very absorbing that is all.<br />?<br />I like your casting experiment :)) Right on with Burton, Redford and Alec Guinness. Dont' know some of the other names. And not sure at all about Nargis..to me Draupadi will always be the great actress Savitri (she didn 't play any Draupadis in tamil but twice and very memorable in Telugu). One of her 'Draupadi's is the great movie Narthanashala - on the Virata Parva of the Mahabharat. It is used in University of Wisconsin for studies in Indian mythology. I have a copy subttiled in English, if you like, one other thing to trade :))<br />?<br />BTW did you get to see Malgudi Days and did you like it?<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Dear friends,<br />I realize that this is a 'Kalki' site, but would it interest anyone to<br />'cast' the Mahabharata with International actors/actresses?</p>
<p>I'm sure that the Peter Brook version is extremely controversial,<br />but I found it fascinating: all the various ethnic groups he<br />included to make it a truly global Epic.</p>
<p>He had an Israeli play Krishna; an African American: Karna; Spaniard: Yudhishthara; a Japanese actress for Gandhari; forget who played the twins. Anyway, I was really absorbed,<br />tho some were not the way my imagination had pictured them.<br />I'm pretty old so have seen lots of Western actors over the years.</p>
