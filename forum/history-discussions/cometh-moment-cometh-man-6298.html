</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I am branching out this thread "Tribute to Kunnakudi" to the subject<br />mentioned in the subject line.</p>
<p>As mentioned healthy competition gave us good songs I am adding a few more<br />examples.</p>
<p>1. No one can forget the song "Vaan Nila Nila Alla" song. This was Mr.MSV<br />and Kaviarasar Combo. Mr.MSV had decided on the tune and asked Kaviarasar to<br />come out with lyrics which would end with 'La'. Earlier Kaviarasar was<br />lethargic or I am not sure what mind set he was in ... he didnt produce his<br />gems. Mr.MSV wanted the best of Kaviarasar and started scolding him. Why are<br />you called Kaviarasar when you cant write a simple lyric for such a simple<br />tune. Kaviarasar got furious and wrote about 15 saranams for that song.<br />2. Ninaithaale Inikkum is a KB movie and Sujtha was in charge of story<br />and Screen play. This particular incident Sujatha had narrated in his<br />Katradhum Petradhum book. KB once asked Sujatha, whether he had attended any<br />song composition session of MSV and Kaviarasar, for which Sujatha answered<br />in negative. KB took him to the studio where MSV was present with his<br />harmonium. Kaviarasar was asusual late. For the first 15 - 20 minutes they<br />both were discussing about health (Kusalam Visarichu aachu!) Then MSV<br />reminded him about the song composition and proposed the tune. Thannane<br />Thannane Thannane Thannane ... Immediate was Kaviarasar's reply "Yengeyum<br />Yeppodum Sangeetham Sandhosham" MSV sang the tune for the next line.<br />Kaviarasar enquired KB whether he can say something philasophical and KB<br />agreed. Immediate was Kaviarasar's lyric "Rathirigal Vandhuvittal<br />Sastirangal Odividum" Sujatha has written that the whole song was completed<br />in 15 minutes. Sujatha asked Kaviarasar, "How is it possible for him to<br />write lyrics with such an ease". Kaviarasar's answer was simple, "If you<br />know the "Sandha Varthaigal" then it is not at all difficult" -- Easier said<br />than done.</p>
<p>I can keep on writing about Kaviarasar but working on a project proposal and<br />my Group head is sitting on my head ...</p>
<p>Laters!</p>

<blockquote><p>  A great loss indeed.</p>
<p>  On Kunnakudi, I remember one of his yesteryear interview to DD..he was<br />  talking about greatness of Kannadasan...while composing the 'maruda<br />  malai maamuniye' song, Kunnakudi wanted to challenge Kannadasan and<br />  hence composed difficult bits but Kaviyarasu without any effort were<br />  composing the lyrics as soon as Kunnakudi finished.</p>
<p>  Towards the end of the song, Kunnakudi was really annoyed and wanted<br />  to throw the toughest and gave the tune of the final verses and again<br />  kaviyarasu with little effort came up with the words 'kadal athu,<br />  malai athu' and everyone was dumbstruck.</p>
<p>  Healthy competition gave us good songs then. Rare to see such healthy<br />  competition these days when the ego takes over everything.</p>

        <p>Ok.. from a slightly different perspective, even as a non-religious person<br />(call me agnostic..) I still find tremendous peace when I visit a temple..<br />not one of the well known temples where you get about a millisecond glimpse<br />of the Idol, but some of the older more secluded temples. (You would<br />probably have made out by now that I am not a big Thirupathi fan). Anyway,<br />regardless of whether I believe in God or not, the very sights and smells of<br />these old temples evokes something in me.. the smell of incense, of fresh<br />flowers, of sandalwood and kumkum and milk and oil... a heady sense of my<br />culture.. for I might be irreligious and agnostic or even atheistic but you<br />still can't take the sum of my culture, something that has come down through<br />millenia out of me.</p>
<p>So I would suggest that Sanathana Dharma is not merely for those that<br />believe in God.. :) but for others as well! It is more than just the sum of<br />its components.. it is a way of life.</p>

        <p>Udanx; You really had me laughing there. Your hero worship of IR is really<br />something ive never seen before. My cousins used to have some really violent<br />fights on whether SPB or KJ Yesudoss was better. I guess this is something<br />like this.<br />Its ok to think IR is a genius film musician but i dont think u can remove<br />Rehman just like that. I dont think you would ever be able to agree upon<br />this simply because your hero worship is blinding you from looking at<br />others.</p>

        <p>Udanx, everyone deserves a right to their opinion. This is exactly what I talked about what hero worship does is leading to self righteousness. If IRRwanted to be purely classical genius he should not have chosen film music as his centre, if he does film music there will be comparison to ARR and?MSV and everyone you imagine who makes film music.<br />?<br />I can read any blog discussing ragas and music objectively, go to tfmmusic.com and there is lot of discussion like that. I refuse to read blogs by hero worshippers regardless of what it may be, since it is overwhelmingly for and about one person and is not considering what others have done in true spirit and regard.(The last link you sent?said on front page that no comparisons with other directors and I left the page right away.)<br />?<br />I have tried to see your point of view, I am sorry to see that you refuse to acknowledge or see mine or any others.I don't love ARR or for that matterMSV or anyone, just like good songs.ARR may not be creative genius but hasmade a huge difference by popularizing tamil film music world over. Even abroad people know indian film music as related to Rehman. IRR's creative genius does not and should not preclude what others have done and it is very narrow minded/judgemental to think so.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

        <p>Well, this may be the last mail from my side w.r.t this thread.</p>
<p>1. I am surprised that you people discuss ARR in the same league? Well<br />there is a good gap between being Bbrilliant / Shrewed and a Genius. ARR no<br />doubt is a brilliant / street smart guy. But don't say that he is brilliant.<br />His knowledge in music is no where near the people whom we discussed<br />earlier. I know I will be in the bad books of many people who love ARR.<br />2. I had given you the link for blog where my friend Rajendran use to<br />write about ilayaraja and only about ilayaraja. Do spare time to read that<br />blog and get to know what is Raja's contribution to film music visa viz<br />others. Once you are done with that fully and ready for an argument /<br />discussion I will surface that time. Till then ... Good Luck!</p>

        <p>Dear Kathie, no problem with rambling at all, from my side:) And especiallyon the joys of ritual and celebration and all those things which I grew upwith. Just not sure where to begin. As you probably know there is no shortages of images/myths/rituals in hindu religion so much so that one forgets what is real and what is symbolic and they are blended together almost everywhere. What I remember fondly is the general sense of compassion that we were taught as children so naturally. Compassion and Kindness towards everyone and everything, including plants, animals, nature...My grandmother used to say even to murmur a prayer of apology towards a plant while plucking its flower. And flowers offered to God were never to be thrown in garbage, only buried in earth. ?If you step on paper it was considered equivalent tostepping on Saraswati so you tried to avoid it. Innumerable things like that. <br />?<br />Taking care of elders is a huge part of our dharma, I grew up in an extended family with seven elders and fond memories are about being passed around from one crinkled hand to another. We didn't have much of material wealth but we had lots and lots of love and the elders made sure there was atleast one family reunion wiht all cousins (upto 4 levels). All that is sadly a rarity in the India of today - many kids dont' even know one level of cousinslet alone 4. Taking care of elders and ensuring their?safe passage into another world is considered?an?important rite of passage and completionof cycle of life, what I find to be a huge gap in western culture, particularly american culture. <br />?<br />Another concept is Atidhi Devo Bhava or treating guests as God. Anyone who visits is treated with love, respect, courtesy - nobody is ever turned downeven if the family has humble means, lots of my cousins still recall with gratitude the experience of generosity with which my grandmother treated them, only rice with buttermilk and pickle for dinner but? everyone gets atleast a little with lots of love. <br />?<br />I have learnt lots of good things in this country but I learnt to treat these values as even more sacred after I saw how much they were missing here. One often times does not learn the value of things if they are not taught or ingrained indigenously into the culture and what our culture taught was some of these. Hope I have not bored you and salute your open mindedness andgenerosity of spirit!!<br />?<br />Bests<br />?<br />Malathi<br />?<br />?</p>

<p>Yes definitely, I like many of ARR's songs too. The issue I have with? isthis overt hero worship of Ilayaraja by many that has overshadowed almost every other music director's contributions. Actually SPB himself talks of this in Coffee with Anu, where he says Gangai Amaran and several others werenever recognized for their talent. <br />?<br />Educated people do not engage in hero worship. We recognize and respect talent in everyone and realize that it takes a variety of talent and a varietyof people who have them.</p>

<p>This is a nice discussion. But i dont think ARR is getting his due especially for what he has achieved in such a short time. He's in the industry for less than 20 years? Even IR had to reinvent his techniques (not music whichwas and is divine) after Roja. Tamil music, tamil cinema owe a lot to ARR simply for making?an effort to globalise. Regarding him redoing his own tunes, come on, its his own tune...he's not taking IR's or MSV's tune!! If he feels?Karuthamma song would have suited Vande Matharam then he can do it, its not IR's tune, is it? And Vande Mataram was a stunning album which?made the phrase Vande Mataram?comfortable to a whole new generation.<br />?<br />And the guy is inredibly shy during interviews. There was this interview inNDTV and the host was really agitated as ARR was only giving answers in "mmmm" and all the while looking down. This was sometime after Roja and then after some years they had another one which was only slightly better. <br />?<br />IR, MSV are all incredible?south Indian music directors.?ARR is of another level. A true product of globalisation.<br />?<br />Regards<br />Rahul<br />?</p></rahul.dhinakaran@></p>

        <p>Dear Malathi,<br />This is probably a very stupid question, but as a westerner<br />raised as a Protestant Christian, with a very simple severe<br />code of faith: no images, only Jesus &amp; God to be revered:<br />since you're very articulate, can you describe to me the<br />wonder and joy you felt as a child when taken to a temple?<br />If that's what you felt? What did Sanatana Dharma feel<br />like to you, growing up ? I'm fascinated with the way other<br />people see the world and how they feel they must act in it.</p>
<p>Congregational &amp; Presbyterian Christianity is very simple, no frills,<br />no images, just a cross on a table in front, good organ music<br />and quite a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of congregational singing, no images. [ I think<br />we're starved for images]<br />Only a few prayers chanted together: but it expects good behavior &amp; no <br />pride ! --<br />PRIDE's considered one of the greatest sins.<br />Northern Europe is dark a lot of the year, which I think creates a <br />dark outlook,<br />yet people descended from there love myths, rituals,<br />stories of all kinds, told in the black nights.<br />Of course you know that Indo-European languages connect<br />us from Oriya to Welsh.</acronym></p>
<p>I was thrilled when I learned that the God of Fire in India,<br />was AGNI, which means FIRE in Latin. And that he rides a<br />ram - - - Agnus is the name for lamb, in Latin. Christ<br />is Agnus Dei, Lamb of God. -- it's all related.<br />Wow, you talk of rambling ?<br />Hope you don't mind.<br />Please tell me of the pleasures of Sanatana Dharma.</p>

        <p>Kathie, of course we all have people who are our heroes and favorites, I didn't mean that way. Our minds and hearts regardless have to be open to the fact that there is never really 'one' person who is above all, in anything. <br />?<br />And people who make great sacrifices like Gandhi for example deserve a certain godly status perhaps, in my opinion atleast. People who have talent anduse it to earn money are definitely not the same, not that there is anything bad about doing that but everyone has talent and everyone makes money only different degrees that is all.<br />?<br />The mass populace in many ways in India is slave to hero worship - of moviestars, sports stars, politicians everyone, a certain blind adulation that closes thinking and makes enemies out of others with different tastes and ruins?opportunites?and recognition for others.?I meant that is not good that is all.</p>

        <p>Yes definitely, I like many of ARR's songs too. The issue I have with? isthis overt hero worship of Ilayaraja by many that has overshadowed almost every other music director's contributions. Actually SPB himself talks of this in Coffee with Anu, where he says Gangai Amaran and several others werenever recognized for their talent. <br />?<br />Educated people do not engage in hero worship. We recognize and respect talent in everyone and realize that it takes a variety of talent and a varietyof people who have them.</p>

<p>This is a nice discussion. But i dont think ARR is getting his due especially for what he has achieved in such a short time. He's in the industry for less than 20 years? Even IR had to reinvent his techniques (not music whichwas and is divine) after Roja. Tamil music, tamil cinema owe a lot to ARR simply for making?an effort to globalise. Regarding him redoing his own tunes, come on, its his own tune...he's not taking IR's or MSV's tune!! If he feels?Karuthamma song would have suited Vande Matharam then he can do it, its not IR's tune, is it? And Vande Mataram was a stunning album which?made the phrase Vande Mataram?comfortable to a whole new generation.<br />?<br />And the guy is inredibly shy during interviews. There was this interview inNDTV and the host was really agitated as ARR was only giving answers in "mmmm" and all the while looking down. This was sometime after Roja and then after some years they had another one which was only slightly better. <br />?<br />IR, MSV are all incredible?south Indian music directors.?ARR is of another level. A true product of globalisation.<br />?<br />Regards<br />Rahul<br />?</p>

And Vande Mataram was a stunning album which made the phrase Vande Mataram comfortable to a whole new generation.</p>
<p> <br />And the guy is inredibly shy during interviews. There was this interview inNDTV and the host was really agitated as ARR was only giving answers in "mmmm" and all the while looking down. This was sometime after Roja and then after some years they had another one which was only slightly better. </p>
<p> <br />IR, MSV are all incredible south Indian music directors. ARR is of another level. A true product of globalisation.<br /> <br />Regards<br />Rahul<br /> </p>

<p>  I will send the spreadsheet out next week, it is lot more time consuming<br />  that I thought. I have done a few experiments in this regard.</p>
<p>  1 Try to find baselines for ragas - meaning songs that can help you<br />  identify other songs as belonging to the same raga. MSS's Giridhara Gopala<br />  for Mohanam, PUChinnappa's incredible Chandrodayam Inile for<br />  Shankarabharanam , MKT's manmadha lelayai for Charukesi. They have NEVER<br />  failed me. The wholesomeness of music direction comes from this.</p>
<p>  2 Turn off the vocals completely on a movie, including songs. Just listen<br />  to music and let it tell you the story. I don't know how to do this<br />  technically but I have friends who do and hugely enjoyed the output on some<br />  great movies - Lavakusa(KVM/Ghantasala), MayaBazar (Rajeswara<br />  Rao/Ghantasala),Mughal E Azam and Baiju Bawra(the great Naushad) Karnan<br />  (MSV),Shankarabharanam (KVM) and Muthyala Muggu (IR). (I refuse to try<br />  SindhuBhairavi since am unable to close my mind to the MCP nature of the<br />  story). But try this if you can. It is a true tribute to the music director.</p>
<p>  Please let us not close our ears and eyes to the multitude of talent out<br />  there and enjoy *all* of it.</p>

<p>   Udanx, Lots of celebrties do unknown charities.I didnt' say he was<br />   a miser of any sort. The point is there is a direct proportion connection to<br />   the # of movies he made and the amount of money he made. Is there or is<br />   there not? So you can't say he made x movies (and therefore so many ragas,<br />   tunes this that) versus someone else who did less.<br />   It is a big factor, along with others also, ok he was more creative etc.<br />   But not like he did alll of that to use his creativity alone eh?</p>

<p>   Malathy,<br />   For your kind information. For a mammootty starer Malayalam movie in 1989,<br />   IR took just Rs.10k.<br />   And there have been movies which he did free of cost. People do not know<br />   this because he doesnt publicise all these. So your point on IR was behind<br />   money is not valid</p>

<p>  Malathy,<br />  For your kind information. For a mammootty starer Malayalam movie in 1989,<br />  IR took just Rs.10k.<br />  And there have been movies which he did free of cost. People do not know<br />  this because he doesnt publicise all these. So your point on IR was behind<br />  money is not valid</p>

        <p>Malathy,<br />For your kind information. For a mammootty starer Malayalam movie in 1989,<br />IR took just Rs.10k.<br />And there have been movies which he did free of cost. People do not know<br />this because he doesnt publicise all these. So your point on IR was behind<br />money is not valid</p>

        <p>This is a nice discussion. But i dont think ARR is getting his due<br />especially for what he has achieved in such a short time. He's in the<br />industry for less than 20 years? Even IR had to reinvent his techniques (not<br />music which was and is divine) after Roja. Tamil music, tamil cinema owe a<br />lot to ARR simply for making an effort to globalise. Regarding him redoing<br />his own tunes, come on, its his own tune...he's not taking IR's or MSV's<br />tune!! If he feels Karuthamma song would have suited Vande Matharam then he<br />can do it, its not IR's tune, is it? And Vande Mataram was a stunning album<br />which made the phrase Vande Mataram comfortable to a whole new generation.</p>
<p>And the guy is inredibly shy during interviews. There was this interview in<br />NDTV and the host was really agitated as ARR was only giving answers in<br />"mmmm" and all the while looking down. This was sometime after Roja and then<br />after some years they had another one which was only slightly better.</p>
<p>IR, MSV are all incredible south Indian music directors. ARR is of another<br />level. A true product of globalisation.</p>

<p>Dear Kathie,</p>
<p>Nothing can compare to Pallava stone work and chola bronze work. I<br />would'nt even want to comment on the current exhibits on sale in<br />mallai - they are'nt even cheap imitations - despite having such<br />amazing structures right in front of their eyes ( in other tourist<br />spots - they would sell replicas) - sadly am yet to see even one<br />replica of a pallava style sold in mallai. </p>
<p>That they could manage this with the tools, technology those days that<br />we are yet to even attempt with so called advancements in technology -<br />the problem is not there - the problem is in the heart - the passion<br />is gone.</p>

        <p>Udanx, also I forgot that whole Subbudu/Kamal thing. Subbudu was an ocean of knowledge in classical music. Kamal knows a lot about movies. But both are master bloopers. Subbudu was asked towards his later years on who was hisfavorite movie director. Take a wild guess whom he said?? IR makes songs like pazhaiya kaalam, ARR does not make music at all - my preference is Deva. Deva the copycat king, in my opinion he does not even rank on the list ofmusic directors worthy of discussion!! Subbudu continued his Deva puranam for a while actually, kumudam i think. Maybe another magazine also but I remember how he stunned the whole music world when he said that.<br />?<br />Kamal, I think I have bashed Kamal enough so not trying any further.

<p>Malathi,<br />?<br />I am Sorry madam.I just quoted what you said in the previous mail. You had written IR knows some classical music. Which is wrong statement and more over its a strong statement. He has very?sound?knowledge, so much that Critic Subbudu had lot of respect for him and has appriciated him. That's what I said as "Vasihtar Vaayala Bramma Rishi Pattam". I know,?now you will say even Subbudu is partial / also one sided?/ kakka pudikkaravar! Correct-a? If that's is the case, then we will stop arguing this point (IR is well versed in Classical Music) here itself. I need a black and white answer from your end in the next mail. Not a grey answer neither here not there.<br />?<br />Coming to the number of songs IR has in his kitty. When you talk to people who call themselves as IR fans ask them their favorite. I am sure they willsay "Poo Malaye Thol Serava" / Udaya Geetham Songs / Or if you insist on even earlier songs they may come to Jonny. But let me tell you when you lookat his career from Annakili to Moodupani (His 100th movie) he has tried / experimented many ragas during this period. I will say post 85 were all hitall his experiments were 76 - 85.<br />?<br />Coming to the Tier-1 / Tier-2 concept I do agree that MSV / KVM are all there in Tier-1. But I do have a ranking there in that Tier. I didn't reveal that. Do I need to say who is 1st rank in that Tier-1? Again we may start discussing why 1st Rank to IR?and why not MSV / KVM.<br />?<br />Thats what I said in my previous mail?- All of them have the same set of Ragas. But why didn't it strike MSV and KVM to do the experiments which IR did? Applying the same concept again and again is a ordinary thing. Being curious about new things and ideas, trying them out in?film music?by applying his imagination. This is just like a scientist. All others greats of previous generations are good teachers, not a scientist. But this man is a good scientist. So I give this extra credit to this man and I place him up on the top. Above all the greats of yester years.<br />?<br />Remember Kamal once said about IR, you should not call him "Isai Gnani" rather you should call him "Isai Vignani" Now you may question Kamal's knowledge in music. Kamal once broke his leg and was out of film shooting for sometime. He utilised that to start his music classes and his teacher was Dr.Balamuralikrishn a.<br />?<br />Again coming back to Ragas handled by other greats show me one in Kanakangi- First Ragam in Melakarta. IR has composed "Mohan Yennum" song in Sindhu Bhairavi.<br />?<br />Debate will continue! Waiting for your reply!<br />?<br />~ Udanx<br />?</p>

<p>Udanx, I will go through the excel file and respond to you on the ragas. I never disputed IR's knowledge but only said most music directors did have considerable knowledge of classical music.<br />?<br />Also, most usage of ragas in movies is diluted. Including IR they always doa lot of mix and match, we can only say what is closest. IR did more movies/music than most others, so obviously his count may be higher. <br />?<br />There is no shortage of usage of ragas by veteras - in particular G Ramanathan, Ghantasala and KVM. They have also used ragas that IR has not tried. In other words it is not a comparison and elimination game. I will post moreinfo on the specific ragas you said later tonight. In general - Let us respect, enjoy the music and then hero worship the people, if possible not hero worship at all - that is all.</p>

<p>Malati,<br />?<br /><Quote <br />IR knows some classical music <br /></quote>?<br />That was a very strong statement. Great insult! Find attached the XL sheet which I am preparing on the compositions of Raja.?As I said this is incomplete. Need to do a lot of work. But as they say in Tamizh "Oru Paanai Sotrukku oru Soru Padam" Trust this sample size will make you understand what depth of knowledge he has got. Tell me one music director who tried all these ragas?<br />?<br />I am not putting the previous generation music directors in Tier 2. When did I say that? Since Sunil Gavaskar plays perfect Copy book shot, and not innovation shots like flick / late cut?/ square cut can I?place him as a Tier 2 batsman. He is also up there. But my point was there is joy when youwatch Vishy which is lacking in Sunil Gavaskar. When Gavasakar plays a shot he needs to run and he doesnt hesitate to run. But ask Vishy fans how to play a square cut. They will imitate the shot and also raise their left hand! Reason, He is informing his partner, dont bother to run mate, it will reach the boundary. Sheer pleasure and that to classic. Not Cheap thrill!<br />?<br /><Quote <br />orchestra and singers to play the way the director wants, completing the songs in said time<br /></quote>?<br />Have you ever heard of Raja failing his dates. Never. More over he never plays the tune in his harmonium / key board or for that matter any instrument. He listens to the situation and coposes tuens - Writes the notes for the song. He never plays a tune in harmonium or any other instrument. For IR tocompose music he doesnt need any instrument just a A4 size paper is enough. All his musicians have to do is to play the notes given to them! This is just like Vaazha Pazhatha urichu Vaaila vekkara maadiri. If they cant play even after?that then they are not musicians.<br />?<br />If you have purchased Tiruvasagam Symphony with 2 CDs - One with the music and other a curtain raiser to that. IR himself will quote incident. <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  - Tiruvasagam Symphony,?had 80 different instruments and 300 odd musicians. As usual he just wrote the notes he never played the music on the instruments. He distributed the notes among musicians and was on his way to the mixer room. Hardly 2 minutes, on his way to the mixer room, he realized that the music which was being played down by the musicians didn't tally with the notes he had given to them. Are you able to appriciate this. He is able to visualize OR Internally hear the music which would come out when the 300 musicians play his notes in the 80 odd instruments!<br />?<br /><Quote <br />Using classical ragas is common with every music director since the dawn oftime <br /></quote>?<br />Agreed, but when to use what raga, depending upon the mood of the song, situation of the song / film thats where he is brilliant. For example in "Unnal Mudiyum Thambi" he could have composed the song "Idhazhil Kadhai YezhudumNeramidhu" song in any raga which brings in the mood of two people in love. But he chose to compose it on Raga Lalitha, which happens to be the name of Sita's charecter Lalithakamalam. Similarly I have quoted "Sangeethame" song from "Kovil Pura" Movie in the xl sheet. My point for IR its is not yedavadhu oru raagam .. <br />?<br /><Quote <br />IR's songs, many of them starting sounding similar because of the demand and pressure<br /></quote>?<br />In the XL sheet attached I have named so many songs which are composed on the same Raga can you see a similarity in them? "Oh Vasantha Raja"?from "Neengal Kettavai" / "Pon Vanam Thanneer Thuvuthu"?from the movie "Indru Nee Naalai Naan" / "Sindhiya Venmani" from the movie?"Poonthota Kavalkaran"are all based on one raga can you say they sound similar! Come on!<br />?<br /><Quote <br />Ungalukku IR mattum dhan pudichurikkunna that is perfectly fine<br /></quote>?<br />I do like other music directors and listen to their music. I love MSV's songs. Its like watching Gavaskar / Amarnath / Vengsarkar / Sachin / Dravid / Laxman.?They are all good batsman no doubt and I agree. But the pleasure in watching Vishy is simply missing in others. People who have watched Vishy play?will agree to what I say.?<br />?<br />?~ Udanx<br />-- <br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</acronym></p>

<p>Malathi,<br />?<br />I am Sorry madam.I just quoted what you said in the previous mail. You had written IR knows some classical music. Which is wrong statement and more over its a strong statement. He has very?sound?knowledge, so much that Critic Subbudu had lot of respect for him and has appriciated him. That's what I said as "Vasihtar Vaayala Bramma Rishi Pattam". I know,?now you will say even Subbudu is partial / also one sided?/ kakka pudikkaravar! Correct-a? If that's is the case, then we will stop arguing this point (IR is well versed in Classical Music) here itself. I need a black and white answer from your end in the next mail. Not a grey answer neither here not there.<br />?<br />Coming to the number of songs IR has in his kitty. When you talk to people who call themselves as IR fans ask them their favorite. I am sure they willsay "Poo Malaye Thol Serava" / Udaya Geetham Songs / Or if you insist on even earlier songs they may come to Jonny. But let me tell you when you lookat his career from Annakili to Moodupani (His 100th movie) he has tried / experimented many ragas during this period. I will say post 85 were all hitall his experiments were 76 - 85.<br />?<br />Coming to the Tier-1 / Tier-2 concept I do agree that MSV / KVM are all there in Tier-1. But I do have a ranking there in that Tier. I didn't reveal that. Do I need to say who is 1st rank in that Tier-1? Again we may start discussing why 1st Rank to IR?and why not MSV / KVM.<br />?<br />Thats what I said in my previous mail?- All of them have the same set of Ragas. But why didn't it strike MSV and KVM to do the experiments which IR did? Applying the same concept again and again is a ordinary thing. Being curious about new things and ideas, trying them out in?film music?by applying his imagination. This is just like a scientist. All others greats of previous generations are good teachers, not a scientist. But this man is a good scientist. So I give this extra credit to this man and I place him up on the top. Above all the greats of yester years.<br />?<br />Remember Kamal once said about IR, you should not call him "Isai Gnani" rather you should call him "Isai Vignani" Now you may question Kamal's knowledge in music. Kamal once broke his leg and was out of film shooting for sometime. He utilised that to start his music classes and his teacher was Dr.Balamuralikrishn a.<br />?<br />Again coming back to Ragas handled by other greats show me one in Kanakangi- First Ragam in Melakarta. IR has composed "Mohan Yennum" song in Sindhu Bhairavi.<br />?<br />Debate will continue! Waiting for your reply!<br />?<br />~ Udanx<br />?</p>

<p>Udanx, I will go through the excel file and respond to you on the ragas. I never disputed IR's knowledge but only said most music directors did have considerable knowledge of classical music.<br />?<br />Also, most usage of ragas in movies is diluted. Including IR they always doa lot of mix and match, we can only say what is closest. IR did more movies/music than most others, so obviously his count may be higher. <br />?<br />There is no shortage of usage of ragas by veteras - in particular G Ramanathan, Ghantasala and KVM. They have also used ragas that IR has not tried. In other words it is not a comparison and elimination game. I will post moreinfo on the specific ragas you said later tonight. In general - Let us respect, enjoy the music and then hero worship the people, if possible not hero worship at all - that is all.</p>

<p>Malati,<br />?<br /><Quote <br />IR knows some classical music <br /></quote>?<br />That was a very strong statement. Great insult! Find attached the XL sheet which I am preparing on the compositions of Raja.?As I said this is incomplete. Need to do a lot of work. But as they say in Tamizh "Oru Paanai Sotrukku oru Soru Padam" Trust this sample size will make you understand what depth of knowledge he has got. Tell me one music director who tried all these ragas?<br />?<br />I am not putting the previous generation music directors in Tier 2. When did I say that? Since Sunil Gavaskar plays perfect Copy book shot, and not innovation shots like flick / late cut?/ square cut can I?place him as a Tier 2 batsman. He is also up there. But my point was there is joy when youwatch Vishy which is lacking in Sunil Gavaskar. When Gavasakar plays a shot he needs to run and he doesnt hesitate to run. But ask Vishy fans how to play a square cut. They will imitate the shot and also raise their left hand! Reason, He is informing his partner, dont bother to run mate, it will reach the boundary. Sheer pleasure and that to classic. Not Cheap thrill!<br />?<br /><Quote <br />orchestra and singers to play the way the director wants, completing the songs in said time<br /></quote>?<br />Have you ever heard of Raja failing his dates. Never. More over he never plays the tune in his harmonium / key board or for that matter any instrument. He listens to the situation and coposes tuens - Writes the notes for the song. He never plays a tune in harmonium or any other instrument. For IR tocompose music he doesnt need any instrument just a A4 size paper is enough. All his musicians have to do is to play the notes given to them! This is just like Vaazha Pazhatha urichu Vaaila vekkara maadiri. If they cant play even after?that then they are not musicians.<br />?<br />If you have purchased Tiruvasagam Symphony with 2 CDs - One with the music and other a curtain raiser to that. IR himself will quote incident. <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  - Tiruvasagam Symphony,?had 80 different instruments and 300 odd musicians. As usual he just wrote the notes he never played the music on the instruments. He distributed the notes among musicians and was on his way to the mixer room. Hardly 2 minutes, on his way to the mixer room, he realized that the music which was being played down by the musicians didn't tally with the notes he had given to them. Are you able to appriciate this. He is able to visualize OR Internally hear the music which would come out when the 300 musicians play his notes in the 80 odd instruments!<br />?<br /><Quote <br />Using classical ragas is common with every music director since the dawn oftime <br /></quote>?<br />Agreed, but when to use what raga, depending upon the mood of the song, situation of the song / film thats where he is brilliant. For example in "Unnal Mudiyum Thambi" he could have composed the song "Idhazhil Kadhai YezhudumNeramidhu" song in any raga which brings in the mood of two people in love. But he chose to compose it on Raga Lalitha, which happens to be the name of Sita's charecter Lalithakamalam. Similarly I have quoted "Sangeethame" song from "Kovil Pura" Movie in the xl sheet. My point for IR its is not yedavadhu oru raagam .. <br />?<br /><Quote <br />IR's songs, many of them starting sounding similar because of the demand and pressure<br /></quote>?<br />In the XL sheet attached I have named so many songs which are composed on the same Raga can you see a similarity in them? "Oh Vasantha Raja"?from "Neengal Kettavai" / "Pon Vanam Thanneer Thuvuthu"?from the movie "Indru Nee Naalai Naan" / "Sindhiya Venmani" from the movie?"Poonthota Kavalkaran"are all based on one raga can you say they sound similar! Come on!<br />?<br /><Quote <br />Ungalukku IR mattum dhan pudichurikkunna that is perfectly fine<br /></quote>?<br />I do like other music directors and listen to their music. I love MSV's songs. Its like watching Gavaskar / Amarnath / Vengsarkar / Sachin / Dravid / Laxman.?They are all good batsman no doubt and I agree. But the pleasure in watching Vishy is simply missing in others. People who have watched Vishy play?will agree to what I say.?<br />?<br />?~ Udanx<br />-- <br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</acronym></p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Malathi, Udanx,</p>
<p>Good debate...Everyone has their talent and we should respect<br />everyone. My order of preference for music always goes from b/w movies<br />to IR and then only to the latest movies. Whatever said and done, IR<br />is IR and we should accept that. And I felt some of Malathi's words<br />are harsh towards IR...</p>
<p>I remember IR himself saying that, he delivers only a portion of what<br />he thinks in his mind, because by the time he gets a music in his<br />mind, and recollect and write it as notes in the paper, he misses most<br />of the them. Because music is a continuous flow and very difficult to<br />keep pace of the minds speed. So if only a portion of his creativity<br />has shaken us, what will be the full force of his thought process??</p>
<p>Recently in one concert, SPB narrated their experience of a song<br />recording in Bombay. The orchestra was local and IR, SPB and team were<br />there to record a song. After the recording is done, one of the local<br />orchestra talked with SPB and scolded IR with bad words...dont ask<br />that person to come again, he is giving very difficult notes to play<br />and better you too dont come back, because you are ruining our income<br />by finishing the song in one take....</p>
<p>As Udanx said, no one can match the mood that IR can create. As I<br />said, IR music can be visualized. When I heard a song from Pithamagan<br />before the movie was released, I was thinking that it should be a<br />climax song and could feel what the song situation could be and the<br />same I could see when the movie was released.</p>
<p>And on Hey Ram, Kamal said, the music is history, never happened and<br />will never happen - L.Subramaniam was the music director, composed the<br />songs for Hey Ram and almost 80% of the song shooting was completed.<br />Then due to some reason, L.Subramaniam moved out and due to personal<br />friendship Kamal requested IR to take over. All the filming done for<br />the movie was a loss as they have to shoot the songs again with IRs<br />music. IR coming to know of this, said, dont throw it away, show me<br />the picturisation of the songs without the music, I will compose the<br />new songs, with the same lyrics for the lip movement of what has been<br />shot already.... and thats how it was done...I dont think anyone will<br />have that guts to do such a thing and the music of HeyRam are pretty<br />decent...</p>
<p>Talking of ARR - I was a die hard fan of Rahman once. Though he is a<br />great music director, I have my reservations, when he reuses the same<br />music again and again...Tamil songs remade into Hindi, then again into<br />english...also read a review on his album,'Vande Mataram' - if this is<br />his dream project, why cant he create a new piece and why is he<br />reusing the song from Karuthamma?' very valid point....</p>
<p>And ARR's songs used in hollywood movies - The movie 'Inside Man' has<br />'Chayya Chayya' full song as its title song,with due credits to ARR.<br />It was pleasure to see a Hindi song played as title song in a<br />hollywood movie and that too the music director is a Tamil....what<br />else to say..</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

        <p>Dear Vijay,<br />Would you agree with me that stone sculpture<br />{and also bronzes} deteriorated in quality after<br />the 11th century? When I walked by the Shilpa<br />stalls in Mallai a couple of winters ago, I was<br />unhappy to see how stiff, wooden, uninspired<br />the murthis were. Where has the 'prana' gone?<br />I know they have to follow strict rules of proportion<br />and gesture, but still. . .<br />Do you agree?<br />I do admire some of the later Gopuram murthis, though.<br />They still have lots of inner energy.<br />Kathie</p>

        <p>Malathi,</p>
<p>I am Sorry madam.I just quoted what you said in the previous mail. You had<br />written IR knows some classical music. Which is wrong statement and more<br />over its a strong statement. He has very sound knowledge, so much that<br />Critic Subbudu had lot of respect for him and has appriciated him. That's<br />what I said as "Vasihtar Vaayala Bramma Rishi Pattam". I know, now you will<br />say even Subbudu is partial / also one sided / kakka pudikkaravar!<br />Correct-a? If that's is the case, then we will stop arguing this point (IR<br />is well versed in Classical Music) here itself. I need a black and white<br />answer from your end in the next mail. Not a grey answer neither here not<br />there.</p>
<p>Coming to the number of songs IR has in his kitty. When you talk to people<br />who call themselves as IR fans ask them their favorite. I am sure they will<br />say "Poo Malaye Thol Serava" / Udaya Geetham Songs / Or if you insist on<br />even earlier songs they may come to Jonny. But let me tell you when you look<br />at his career from Annakili to Moodupani (His 100th movie) he has tried /<br />experimented many ragas during this period. I will say post 85 were all hit<br />all his experiments were 76 - 85.</p>
<p>Coming to the Tier-1 / Tier-2 concept I do agree that MSV / KVM are all<br />there in Tier-1. But I do have a ranking there in that Tier. I didn't reveal<br />that. Do I need to say who is 1st rank in that Tier-1? Again we may start<br />discussing why 1st Rank to IR and why not MSV / KVM.</p>
<p>Thats what I said in my previous mail - All of them have the same set of<br />Ragas. But why didn't it strike MSV and KVM to do the experiments which IR<br />did? Applying the same concept again and again is a ordinary thing. Being<br />curious about new things and ideas, trying them out in film music by<br />applying his imagination. This is just like a scientist. All others greats<br />of previous generations are good teachers, not a scientist. But this man is<br />a good scientist. So I give this extra credit to this man and I place him up<br />on the top. Above all the greats of yester years.</p>
<p>Remember Kamal once said about IR, you should not call him "Isai Gnani"<br />rather you should call him "Isai Vignani" Now you may question Kamal's<br />knowledge in music. Kamal once broke his leg and was out of film shooting<br />for some time. He utilised that to start his music classes and his teacher<br />was Dr.Balamuralikrishna.</p>
<p>Again coming back to Ragas handled by other greats show me one in Kanakangi<br />- First Ragam in Melakarta. IR has composed "Mohan Yennum" song in Sindhu<br />Bhairavi.</p>
<p>Debate will continue! Waiting for your reply!</p>

<p>  Also, most usage of ragas in movies is diluted. Including IR they always do<br />  a lot of mix and match, we can only say what is closest. IR did more<br />  movies/music than most others, so obviously his count may be higher.</p>
<p>  There is no shortage of usage of ragas by veteras - in particular G<br />  Ramanathan, Ghantasala and KVM. They have also used ragas that IR has not<br />  tried. In other words it is not a comparison and elimination game. I will<br />  post more info on the specific ragas you said later tonight.

Tell me one music director who tried all<br />  these ragas?</p>
<p>  I am not putting the previous generation music directors in Tier 2. When<br />  did I say that? Since Sunil Gavaskar plays perfect Copy book shot, and not<br />  innovation shots like flick / late cut / square cut can I place him as a<br />  Tier 2 batsman. He is also up there. But my point was there is joy when you<br />  watch Vishy which is lacking in Sunil Gavaskar. When Gavasakar plays a shot<br />  he needs to run and he doesnt hesitate to run. But ask Vishy fans how to<br />  play a square cut. They will imitate the shot and also raise their left<br />  hand! Reason, He is informing his partner, dont bother to run mate, it will<br />  reach the boundary. Sheer pleasure and that to classic. Not Cheap thrill!</p>
<p>  <Quote <br />  orchestra and singers to play the way the director wants, completing the<br />  songs in said time<br />  </quote>
</p><p>  Have you ever heard of Raja failing his dates. Never. More over he never<br />  plays the tune in his harmonium / key board or for that matter any<br />  instrument. He listens to the situation and coposes tuens - Writes the notes<br />  for the song. He never plays a tune in harmonium or any other instrument.<br />  For IR to compose music he doesnt need any instrument just a A4 size paper<br />  is enough. All his musicians have to do is to play the notes given to them!<br />  This is just like Vaazha Pazhatha urichu Vaaila vekkara maadiri. If they<br />  cant play even after that then they are not musicians.</p>
<p>  If you have purchased Tiruvasagam Symphony with 2 CDs - One with the music<br />  and other a curtain raiser to that. IR himself will quote incident. FYI -<br />  Tiruvasagam Symphony, had 80 different instruments and 300 odd musicians. As<br />  usual he just wrote the notes he never played the music on the instruments.<br />  He distributed the notes among musicians and was on his way to the mixer<br />  room. Hardly 2 minutes, on his way to the mixer room, he realized that the<br />  music which was being played down by the musicians didn't tally with the<br />  notes he had given to them. Are you able to appriciate this. He is able to<br />  visualize OR Internally hear the music which would come out when the 300<br />  musicians play his notes in the 80 odd instruments!</p>

</p><p>  Agreed, but when to use what raga, depending upon the mood of the song,<br />  situation of the song / film thats where he is brilliant. For example in<br />  "Unnal Mudiyum Thambi" he could have composed the song "Idhazhil Kadhai<br />  Yezhudum Neramidhu" song in any raga which brings in the mood of two people<br />  in love. But he chose to compose it on Raga Lalitha, which happens to be the<br />  name of Sita's charecter Lalithakamalam. Similarly I have quoted<br />  "Sangeethame" song from "Kovil Pura" Movie in the xl sheet. My point for IR<br />  its is not yedavadhu oru raagam ..</p>
<p>  <Quote <br />  IR's songs, many of them starting sounding similar because of the demand<br />  and pressure<br />  </quote>
</p><p>  In the XL sheet attached I have named so many songs which are composed on<br />  the same Raga can you see a similarity in them? "Oh Vasantha Raja" from<br />  "Neengal Kettavai" / "Pon Vanam Thanneer Thuvuthu" from the movie "Indru Nee<br />  Naalai Naan" / "Sindhiya Venmani" from the movie "Poonthota Kavalkaran" are<br />  all based on one raga can you say they sound similar! Come on!</p>

</p><p>  I do like other music directors and listen to their music. I love MSV's<br />  songs. Its like watching Gavaskar / Amarnath / Vengsarkar / Sachin / Dravid<br />  / Laxman.

        <p>I think there is no debate at all if you agree that everyone contributed intheir own way (including ARR) as many others said!! You said quite clearlyyou thought IR had 'legend' status while others are 'just greats' and thatis the point I dispute.<br />?<br />Yeah one tune seems similar and he used the same raaga...talk of rehashing..of course he had to meet deadlines, producer enna paithyima, he is paying out of his nose :)) I mean it is a known fact against IR admitted himself that he was overcommitted and could not deliver the quality he wanted. He even went as far as saying he wished he never came to movies, in a kumudam interview. </p>
<p>Everyone used raagas, most people made it as a rags to riches story. One ofthe reasons why classical music detiorated so much is due to athiest movement and many classical music singers/directors happened to be brahmins. In fact the common man's image of a classical music singer itslef is a kudumi mama. During its worst times you could not even watch movies with lot of songs in a theatre. IR arrived at this time. He had immense talent to go withit and he made it. End of story.<br />?<br />Malathi<br />--- On Fri, 9/12/08, Udanx <udanks@gmail.com  wrote:</p>

<p>Malati,<br />?<br /><Quote <br />IR knows some classical music <br /></quote>?<br />That was a very strong statement. Great insult! Find attached the XL sheet which I am preparing on the compositions of Raja.?As I said this is incomplete. Need to do a lot of work. But as they say in Tamizh "Oru Paanai Sotrukku oru Soru Padam" Trust this sample size will make you understand what depth of knowledge he has got. Tell me one music director who tried all these ragas?<br />?<br />I am not putting the previous generation music directors in Tier 2. When did I say that? Since Sunil Gavaskar plays perfect Copy book shot, and not innovation shots like flick / late cut?/ square cut can I?place him as a Tier 2 batsman. He is also up there. But my point was there is joy when youwatch Vishy which is lacking in Sunil Gavaskar. When Gavasakar plays a shot he needs to run and he doesnt hesitate to run. But ask Vishy fans how to play a square cut. They will imitate the shot and also raise their left hand! Reason, He is informing his partner, dont bother to run mate, it will reach the boundary. Sheer pleasure and that to classic. Not Cheap thrill!<br />?<br /><Quote <br />orchestra and singers to play the way the director wants, completing the songs in said time<br /></quote>?<br />Have you ever heard of Raja failing his dates. Never. More over he never plays the tune in his harmonium / key board or for that matter any instrument. He listens to the situation and coposes tuens - Writes the notes for the song. He never plays a tune in harmonium or any other instrument. For IR tocompose music he doesnt need any instrument just a A4 size paper is enough. All his musicians have to do is to play the notes given to them! This is just like Vaazha Pazhatha urichu Vaaila vekkara maadiri. If they cant play even after?that then they are not musicians.<br />?<br />If you have purchased Tiruvasagam Symphony with 2 CDs - One with the music and other a curtain raiser to that. IR himself will quote incident. <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  - Tiruvasagam Symphony,?had 80 different instruments and 300 odd musicians. As usual he just wrote the notes he never played the music on the instruments. He distributed the notes among musicians and was on his way to the mixer room. Hardly 2 minutes, on his way to the mixer room, he realized that the music which was being played down by the musicians didn't tally with the notes he had given to them. Are you able to appriciate this. He is able to visualize OR Internally hear the music which would come out when the 300 musicians play his notes in the 80 odd instruments!<br />?<br /><Quote <br />Using classical ragas is common with every music director since the dawn oftime <br /></quote>?<br />Agreed, but when to use what raga, depending upon the mood of the song, situation of the song / film thats where he is brilliant. For example in "Unnal Mudiyum Thambi" he could have composed the song "Idhazhil Kadhai YezhudumNeramidhu" song in any raga which brings in the mood of two people in love. But he chose to compose it on Raga Lalitha, which happens to be the name of Sita's charecter Lalithakamalam. Similarly I have quoted "Sangeethame" song from "Kovil Pura" Movie in the xl sheet. My point for IR its is not yedavadhu oru raagam .. <br />?<br /><Quote <br />IR's songs, many of them starting sounding similar because of the demand and pressure<br /></quote>?<br />In the XL sheet attached I have named so many songs which are composed on the same Raga can you see a similarity in them? "Oh Vasantha Raja"?from "Neengal Kettavai" / "Pon Vanam Thanneer Thuvuthu"?from the movie "Indru Nee Naalai Naan" / "Sindhiya Venmani" from the movie?"Poonthota Kavalkaran"are all based on one raga can you say they sound similar! Come on!<br />?<br /><Quote <br />Ungalukku IR mattum dhan pudichurikkunna that is perfectly fine<br /></quote>?<br />I do like other music directors and listen to their music. I love MSV's songs. Its like watching Gavaskar / Amarnath / Vengsarkar / Sachin / Dravid / Laxman.?They are all good batsman no doubt and I agree. But the pleasure in watching Vishy is simply missing in others. People who have watched Vishy play?will agree to what I say.?<br />?<br />?~ Udanx<br />-- <br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</acronym></p></udanks@gmail.com></p>

        <p>Vijay,</p>
<p>I am sure you would have heard about the 4 qudrant matrix projected for<br />any problem in any management workshop. Money on the X axis and talent<br />on Y axis. We can ignore HT/HM (high talent, high money) - HM/LT (high<br />money, low talent) groups. It is only the HT/LM (high talent, low money)<br />group which needs patronage for full realization of the group's<br />potential. What is to be done with LT/LM group?</p>

<p>  - Is it the reward he got for his work ( like the mallai artist -<br />  hosted by the artist kings of the great pallava clan)</p>
<p>  - Is it the appreciation he got for his work - worldwide acclaim -<br />  sadly no sculpture signed his work - the fame went to the king or the<br />  donor. so cant see parallels there.</p>
<p>  A direct question that rises from this is, why did the superb art of<br />  sculpture vane - lack of talent, lack of motivation,lack of patrons<br />  /reward, lack of appreciators.</p>
<p>  If we can identify the above, maybe we can try and find the cure.</p>

        <p>Malati,</p>
<p><Quote <br />IR knows some classical music<br /></quote>
</p><p>That was a very strong statement. Great insult! Find attached the XL sheet<br />which I am preparing on the compositions of Raja. As I said this is<br />incomplete. Need to do a lot of work. But as they say in Tamizh "Oru Paanai<br />Sotrukku oru Soru Padam" Trust this sample size will make you understand<br />what depth of knowledge he has got. Tell me one music director who tried all<br />these ragas?</p>
<p>I am not putting the previous generation music directors in Tier 2. When did<br />I say that? Since Sunil Gavaskar plays perfect Copy book shot, and not<br />innovation shots like flick / late cut / square cut can I place him as a<br />Tier 2 batsman. He is also up there. But my point was there is joy when you<br />watch Vishy which is lacking in Sunil Gavaskar. When Gavasakar plays a shot<br />he needs to run and he doesnt hesitate to run. But ask Vishy fans how to<br />play a square cut. They will imitate the shot and also raise their left<br />hand! Reason, He is informing his partner, dont bother to run mate, it will<br />reach the boundary. Sheer pleasure and that to classic. Not Cheap thrill!</p>
<p><Quote <br />orchestra and singers to play the way the director wants, completing the<br />songs in said time<br /></quote>
</p><p>Have you ever heard of Raja failing his dates. Never. More over he never<br />plays the tune in his harmonium / key board or for that matter any<br />instrument. He listens to the situation and coposes tuens - Writes the notes<br />for the song. He never plays a tune in harmonium or any other instrument.<br />For IR to compose music he doesnt need any instrument just a A4 size paper<br />is enough. All his musicians have to do is to play the notes given to them!<br />This is just like Vaazha Pazhatha urichu Vaaila vekkara maadiri. If they<br />cant play even after that then they are not musicians.</p>
<p>If you have purchased Tiruvasagam Symphony with 2 CDs - One with the music<br />and other a curtain raiser to that. IR himself will quote incident. <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  -<br />Tiruvasagam Symphony, had 80 different instruments and 300 odd musicians. As<br />usual he just wrote the notes he never played the music on the instruments.<br />He distributed the notes among musicians and was on his way to the mixer<br />room. Hardly 2 minutes, on his way to the mixer room, he realized that the<br />music which was being played down by the musicians didn't tally with the<br />notes he had given to them. Are you able to appriciate this. He is able to<br />visualize OR Internally hear the music which would come out when the 300<br />musicians play his notes in the 80 odd instruments!</acronym></p>
<p><Quote <br />Using classical ragas is common with every music director since the dawn of<br />time<br /></quote>
</p><p>Agreed, but when to use what raga, depending upon the mood of the song,<br />situation of the song / film thats where he is brilliant. For example in<br />"Unnal Mudiyum Thambi" he could have composed the song "Idhazhil Kadhai<br />Yezhudum Neramidhu" song in any raga which brings in the mood of two people<br />in love. But he chose to compose it on Raga Lalitha, which happens to be the<br />name of Sita's charecter Lalithakamalam. Similarly I have quoted<br />"Sangeethame" song from "Kovil Pura" Movie in the xl sheet. My point for IR<br />its is not yedavadhu oru raagam ..</p>
<p><Quote <br />IR's songs, many of them starting sounding similar because of the demand and<br />pressure<br /></quote>
</p><p>In the XL sheet attached I have named so many songs which are composed on<br />the same Raga can you see a similarity in them? "Oh Vasantha Raja" from<br />"Neengal Kettavai" / "Pon Vanam Thanneer Thuvuthu" from the movie "Indru Nee<br />Naalai Naan" / "Sindhiya Venmani" from the movie "Poonthota Kavalkaran" are<br />all based on one raga can you say they sound similar! Come on!</p>
<p><Quote <br />Ungalukku IR mattum dhan pudichurikkunna that is perfectly fine<br /></quote>
</p><p>I do like other music directors and listen to their music. I love MSV's<br />songs. Its like watching Gavaskar / Amarnath / Vengsarkar / Sachin / Dravid<br />/ Laxman. They are all good batsman no doubt and I agree. But the pleasure<br />in watching Vishy is simply missing in others. People who have watched Vishy<br />play will agree to what I say.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi, Udanx</p>
<p>Sabash Sariyaana potti. But what interested me in the topic is the<br />true joy to the creator in the composition. </p>
<p>- Is it his personal joy on creating a masterpiece ( in sculpture - i<br />would say the kind that the ajanta artist would have felt - his art<br />was not much exhibitionist but reflected perfection), </p>
<p>- Is it the reward he got for his work ( like the mallai artist -<br />hosted by the artist kings of the great pallava clan)</p>
<p>- Is it the appreciation he got for his work - worldwide acclaim -<br />sadly no sculpture signed his work - the fame went to the king or the<br />donor. so cant see parallels there.</p>
<p>A direct question that rises from this is, why did the superb art of<br />sculpture vane - lack of talent, lack of motivation,lack of patrons<br />/reward, lack of appreciators.</p>
<p>If we can identify the above, maybe we can try and find the cure.</p>

        <p>Udanx,<br />?Hai Hai, why woudn't anyone be so inspired when they get the kind of payments he got??? IJokes aside, it is impossible for anyone to make music unless they enjoyed it and were good at it, am not discounting that - but whatI mean by hard work is the sheer logistics, getting the orchestra and singers to play the way the director wants, completing the songs in said time, and so on. IR's songs, many of them starting sounding similar because of the demand and pressure, a creative director acknowledges these difficulties and limits his projects. My point jumps back in from the window :))<br />?<br />Yeah at one point of time he didnt' have a lot of money, at one point of time most film personalites did not have a lot of money - movie stars, music directors all of them especailly in those days. Ghantasala came to Chennai with one shirt?, 2 rupees?and one leg with a limp due to a gunshot in afreedom struggle.MSV lost both his parents and suffered great poverty before he made it. ?Just saying he is not the only one with humble origins saar :))<br />?<br />I did not dispute his taste in classical music?or anything personal like having concerts at home.?Using classical ragas is common with every musicdirector since the dawn of time -Almost all his predecssors did and did soextremely well. Edhavadhu oru ragam edungalen, pappom? You said sindhu bhairavi right? Starting with MKT's vadaname chandra bimbamo(sivakavi, GR), Rajeswara Rao's Mayame Naan Ariyen (Missiamma), MSV's yennai yaar endru (paalum pazhamum), Sitthamellam enakku siva mayame (Thirvarutchelvar) - how manysindhu bhairavis you need? Balamurai, Semmangudi, ellarum greats dhaan. Aana kakka pudikkal asaamis to the core. To me anyway that is not important. IR knows some classical music and has some great compositions. People before him also had their share of that, whether or not the Balamuralis and Semmangudis accepted them is immaterial. That is all. <br />?<br />Kadasiya let us get it straight.?Ungalukku IR mattum dhan pudichurikkunnathat is perfectly fine. Everyone has their favorites and undoubtedly the guy is a great musician. The main point I disagree with you is that his predecessors were somehow secondary or inferior to him. Every man's sucess is acombination of talent and right timing. He had both. Lots of his predecessors have done yeoman contributions to the rich world of music.?We have tohonor and accept everyone in the hall of fame.?That is all. <br />?<br />Ennoda email rules follow panreengalo illayo, paravallai. Aana half mirugathoda manushiya modha naan virumbalai, logical illaya??:) Apparam varra sattham definite IR music madhiri irukkaadhu, ellarum odi do vaanga :)) Good day!!<br />?<br />Malathi?<br />?<br />?<br />?</p>

<p>Malati,</p>
<p>My reply inline in BLUE</p>

<p>Udanx, I mentioned philanthropic acts in honor of those because of <br />their dedication to music even when very little money was involved. <br />You cannot discount the money factor since composing music is very <br />hard work and very difficult to do when money involved is less.</p>
<p>?</p>
<p><Udanx <br />Composing music is hard work ... Hmm Thanks mate for writing this ... It was never a hard work or difficult one for IR. As mentioned in one of my mails "Ilamai Yenum Pookatru" was composed / recorded in 17 minutes. He is known for his speed. First year he had 4 films (Anna Kili / Paalutti Valatha Kili / Badra Kaali / One more) Third year he had 16 films and from there till90s he composed close to 40 films per year. Roughly speaking 1 film per week including songs and background score. Not to mention the diwali / pongaltimes when he use to score music for 4-5 films. So I guess the above mentioned point of yours jumps out of the window.<br /></udanx>
</p><p>?</p>
<p>Please enlighten me on who are the music directors who made more <br />money than IR? Perhaps Rehman now. But In Tamil atleast - IR in his <br />heydays made more than even top notch Hindi directors. My uncle was <br />in income tax and every year his house was a prime target for their <br />raids. They found currency even in his puja room, under the deity. It <br />is a true fact.</p>
<p><Udanx <br />Yes you are on the dot. But poor Mr.MSV, I know for sure he didn't make money. But heard Hindi music directors made lot of money. Its still debatable who made lot of money. But did your uncle say that at one point is time he didn't have any money.<br /></udanx>
</p><p>?</p>
<p>Now let us move on to creativity. One thing - the fusion music that <br />we are talking about is not special. It is one form of music, that is <br />all. Thinking it is higher/lower than traditional music is like <br />saying abstract art is better than realism, or cubism is better than <br />impressionism. No. All are art forms and there are artistes who are <br />good at each of them. IR's forte undoubtedly is his creativity and <br />innovation. Violinist L Subramaniam and Sitar maestro Ravishankar <br />have produced great fusion music - there are people who like them and <br />people who don't. L Subramaniam is not greater than Lalgudi or TN <br />Krishnan just because he produced great fusion music.</p>
<p><Udanx <br />Who said that only fusion is his forte. He used fusion to make his music stand apart from others. I am told that he has a small?auditorium/ music hall in his house and during Navarathri he invites great Vidhwans to perform in that hall. First hand information of a Mridhanga Vidhwan known to our family! Even in film music there are so many songs which he has composed on Pure Carnatic / Hindustani Raga (One example is "Chinna Kannan Azhaikiran" from the movie "Kavi Kuyil"<br /></udanx>
</p><p>?</p>
<p>Yes IR made semi classical music more hummable, hmmm, perhaps. He <br />came at a time when classical music was taking a real beating and all <br />music directors including MSV were past their time. That combined <br />with his natural genius made it click. The common man always <br />appreciated classical music provided it was sung right - MKT's <br />euphoric Manmada leelayai vendraar was enjoyed at every street corner <br />in Tamil Naadu, by the same common man!!</p>
<p><Udanx <br />Semi classical ... Raja and Raga are?inseparable. Naan idhai vanmayaaga kandikkiren. EVen doyens like Semmangudi and Critics like Subbudu accept that he is a genius. Vasishtar Vaayala Bramma Rishi.<br /></udanx>
</p><p>I give full marks to the fact that IR'background was very humble and <br />he did not have training or exposure to music. Yes definitely he <br />stands apart in that regard. But regardless of how much of training <br />and exposure you have , making a break in movies is very hard and <br />even harder to sustain. In other words nobody makes it just because <br />they are talented - with or without background.</p>
<p><Udanx <br />Nandri. For the compliments! (Hope I followed what you had mentioned in another mail. Aana idhey maadiri yeppavum irupennu solla mudiyaadhu. Naan Kadavul Paadhi Mirugam Paadhi!)?<br /></udanx>

<p><Udanx <br />Composing music is hard work ... Hmm Thanks mate for writing this ... It was<br />never a hard work or difficult one for IR. As mentioned in one of my mails<br />"Ilamai Yenum Pookatru" was composed / recorded in 17 minutes. He is known<br />for his speed. First year he had 4 films (Anna Kili / Paalutti Valatha Kili<br />/ Badra Kaali / One more) Third year he had 16 films and from there till 90s<br />he composed close to 40 films per year. Roughly speaking 1 film per week<br />including songs and background score. Not to mention the diwali / pongal<br />times when he use to score music for 4-5 films. So I guess the above<br />mentioned point of yours jumps out of the window.<br /></udanx></p>
<blockquote><p>  Please enlighten me on who are the music directors who made more<br />  money than IR? Perhaps Rehman now. But In Tamil atleast - IR in his<br />  heydays made more than even top notch Hindi directors. My uncle was<br />  in income tax and every year his house was a prime target for their<br />  raids. They found currency even in his puja room, under the deity. It<br />  is a true fact.</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p><Udanx <br />Yes you are on the dot. But poor Mr.MSV, I know for sure he didn't make<br />money. But heard Hindi music directors made lot of money. Its still<br />debatable who made lot of money. But did your uncle say that at one point is<br />time he didn't have any money.<br /></udanx></p>

<p>  Now let us move on to creativity. One thing - the fusion music that<br />  we are talking about is not special. It is one form of music, that is<br />  all. Thinking it is higher/lower than traditional music is like<br />  saying abstract art is better than realism, or cubism is better than<br />  impressionism. No. All are art forms and there are artistes who are<br />  good at each of them. IR's forte undoubtedly is his creativity and<br />  innovation. Violinist L Subramaniam and Sitar maestro Ravishankar<br />  have produced great fusion music - there are people who like them and<br />  people who don't. L Subramaniam is not greater than Lalgudi or TN<br />  Krishnan just because he produced great fusion music.</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p><Udanx <br />Who said that only fusion is his forte. He used fusion to make his music<br />stand apart from others. I am told that he has a small auditorium/ music<br />hall in his house and during Navarathri he invites great Vidhwans to perform<br />in that hall. First hand information of a Mridhanga Vidhwan known to our<br />family! Even in film music there are so many songs which he has composed on<br />Pure Carnatic / Hindustani Raga (One example is "Chinna Kannan Azhaikiran"<br />from the movie "Kavi Kuyil"<br /></udanx>

I do have the highest regards for people who do <br />all this<br />  ... That too with out a hint of publicity that they are doing that. <br />But<br />  thats not in the main stream discussion of this thread.</p>
<p>  Also earning money thats also not counted as there are other music <br />directors<br />  who have made loads of money which IR can never ever think of.</p>
<p>  So lets lets discuss music alone</p>
<p>  1. Talent / Exposure to music / Chances of learning music when <br />they were<br />  young / Surroundings ...<br />  2. Knowledge of music (Carnatic / Hindustani / Western Classic)<br />  3. Application of what they learned<br />  4. Innovation / Experiments in their field</p>
<p>  Having said that I am a great fan of Mr.MSV / Mr.KVM. I have not <br />analyzed<br />  Mr.KVM very critically to some extent Mr.MSV. Again I will tell you <br />the<br />  difference in cricketing terms (In which I am at home) In olden <br />days Leg<br />  Glance or Flick is played when the ball is pitching on leg stump <br />and leaving<br />  the leg stump. Playing that shot is not everybody's forte. Few <br />played it<br />  well.</p>
<p>  But it was GR Vishwanath who re-defined the flick / leg glance. <br />Even if the<br />  ball pitches on off stump and moves towards middle stump he would <br />flick the<br />  ball and it will run to boundary. He would do this effortlessly .<br />  Improvisation at its best. Defying the grammar of music I have given<br />  examples in my earlier posy\t.</p>
<p>  Similarly late cut between Wicket Keeper and 1st slip / 1st slip <br />and 2nd<br />  slip / Slip and Gully. All these need little variation in his hand <br />grip,<br />  open the face of the bat and timing. Similarly moving from one Raga <br />to<br />  another Rage and then coming back to the rage where he started -- <br />IR is a<br />  master in that.</p>
<p>  Vishy use to play shots in a area where there is no fielder. The <br />bowling<br />  captain would move a fielder to the position where Vishy scored <br />runs.<br />  Immediately Vishy would play a shot into the place from where the <br />fielder<br />  was moved. IR would compose on Ragas which others would not even <br />think of.</p>
<p>  Laters!</p>

<p>    Udanx, I have no problems with anyone calling IR a legend or <br />for that<br />    matter appreciating how much effort it took for him to reach <br />where he was.</p>
<p>    Also to remember - olden days musicians did not make a fraction <br />of money<br />    that IR did.Many of them did not even have their name mentioned <br />in the<br />    credits occasionally. KVM helped many younger musicians without <br />his name<br />    mentioned - including MSV and Ghantasala. Ghantasala in turn <br />helped several<br />    people like TV Raju and even SP Balasubramaiam with no credit at <br />all and he<br />    sang many of his own songs since he could not afford playback <br />singers, he<br />    was a very good singer but in spite of that. In fact it was SPB <br />who erected<br />    a statue for his guru/master as he called him very recently.  <br />Ghantasala<br />    died of throat cancer and insisting on singing even until the <br />very last day.<br />    Mohammed Rafi up north was very similar. Rafi used to send <br />anonymous money<br />    contributions in fact to struggling young playback artistes.<br />    There is no one person or one anyone who is above and beyond <br />others. Kalai<br />    ulagam is a contribution of multiple people.</p>

<p>    Arun,</p>
<p>    I have high regards / respects to all the music doyens. But in my<br />    opinion one cannot put the work of IR in simple words, as <br />mentioned in your<br />    mail. He took the "BEST" from every form of music - Carnatic / <br />Hindustani /<br />    Western Classical. He used this knowledge and fused them together <br />when he<br />    composed songs.</p>
<p>    For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal <br />training in<br />    music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in <br />his pocket,<br />    analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying <br />them to film<br />    music ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than <br />done. If I<br />    start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this <br />forum. For me<br />    other musicians great people /doyens and this man is a LEGEND.</p>

<p>     A veritable fount of information! :) Thanks for all that.<br />     I always wondered why KVM didn't do more movies in Tamizh..<br />     Shankarabharanam was KVM right?<br />     Great songs!</p>
<p>     The thing about IR was that he made songs based on classical <br />ragas but<br />     made them in such a way that it was easily hummable by the <br />masses.. amazing.</p>

<p>      Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was <br />Madurai<br />      Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was <br />Ghantasala<br />      at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let <br />the<br />      movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing.<br />      Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in<br />      Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is <br />great<br />      but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or<br />      cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he <br />has used<br />      many ragas and many singers.</p>
<p>      Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all <br />movies<br />      bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, <br />another<br />      one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best <br />movie<br />      mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on <br />African<br />      samba music is another treat.</p>
<p>      KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was <br />Ghantasala's<br />      guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai<br />      AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an <br />absolute<br />      work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to<br />      telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone <br />(until<br />      IR came on the seen again).</p>

<p>          Arun, I learnt classical music from movies too!! I had a <br />strong<br />          aversion of the way classical music was taught - rigid ways <br />with<br />          little creative force and hero worship of musicians,strong <br />caste<br />          factors - so I learnt from movies and after grade 9 attended<br />      classes<br />          and learnt formally. Some generic fyi on old tamil classical<br />      songs in<br />          case you are interested.. .</p>
<p>          G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman( SV Sekar's dad who gave <br />music for<br />      MSS's<br />          Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin<br />          Mummoorthigal in those days.</p>
<p>          Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - <br />Devadas is an<br />          evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's<br />      unbearable<br />          Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the <br />most<br />          famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU<br />      Chinnappa's<br />          clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />          (Shankarabharanam) . I can't recall more on CR right away. G<br />          Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's <br />guru.<br />          Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna<br />          Ramayanam... Wow what a list and most of them classical <br />treats. Who<br />          can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama<br />      puthiran<br />          or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used <br />Mukari<br />      that<br />          way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the <br />MLV<br />      song to<br />          Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai <br />Veeran.</p>
<p>          There are amazing directors in other languages as far as <br />classical<br />          music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala <br />in<br />          Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in <br />Tamil<br />          too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.</p>
<p>          IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have <br />to<br />      give<br />          him credit for that, and his creativity/innovati on is <br />perhaps</p>
<p>          unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which<br />      unfortunately<br />          is very forgotten.</p>

<p>                Aah Raja the Great... it is truly wonderful to listen <br />to his<br />              creations and<br />                one can appreciate it at so many different levels.. <br />carnatic<br />              classical or<br />                western.. here is something I had written on a Guitar <br />forum<br />      on<br />          Madai<br />                Thiranthu.. this might not be everyone's cup of tea <br />but<br />      just to<br />              give you a<br />                flavor for how we can all appreciate Raja in our own <br />way:</p>
<p>                Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and<br />      discusses<br />          the<br />              tamil<br />                song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/ <br />progression<br />          etc. I<br />              doubt it<br />                will be of too much interest to people other than <br />those who<br />          follow<br />              tamil<br />                songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>                I thought that I would start off by posting the <br />chords to<br />      the<br />              song "Madai<br />                Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>                I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if <br />this is<br />      the<br />              original one<br />                since I worked out the chords for this a few years <br />ago, but<br />      it<br />              still works.<br />                If this is not the original scale, you can always <br />move it<br />          around.</p>
<p>                Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>                A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>                The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>                A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>                (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I <br />have<br />      found<br />          that<br />              it<br />                usually helps to understand the scale first before <br />going on<br />      to<br />          the<br />              chords).</p>
<p>                The other thing to note is that you could call this <br />the<br />      A#maj<br />          Scale<br />              or the<br />                Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the <br />A#maj<br />      scale.<br />          (On<br />              the<br />                fretboard, you can identify this by going down three<br />      semitones<br />              (half notes)<br />                to find the relative minor of a major scale). The <br />notes and<br />          chords<br />              remain<br />                the same except that you would start from G instead <br />of A#.<br />      On<br />          second<br />                thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would <br />rather call<br />          this<br />              the Gmin<br />                Scale.</p>
<p>                Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief<br />      discussion:</p>
<p>                Dm Gm A# Dm<br />                Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>                Dm Gm A# Dm<br />                Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>
<p>                Dm Cm Gm<br />                Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram</p>
<p>                Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />                Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu</p>
<p>                Intro - 1<br />                ---------</p>
<p>                Stanza - 1<br />                ==========</p>
<p>                Dm A# Gm A#<br />                Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu</p>
<p>                Dm A# Gm A#<br />                Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>                Cm Cm Cm A#<br />                Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>                A# A# A# Cm<br />                Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>                Cm Dm<br />                YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>                The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>                A few things to note:</p>
<p>                In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>                Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>                I IV V</p>
<p>                where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and<br />      dominant of<br />          the<br />              scale.</p>
<p>                1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then <br />resolves<br />      to the<br />              tonic (Gm)<br />                at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this<br />      interesting<br />              because<br />                usually, people start off a song with the tonic and <br />usually<br />          follow<br />              some<br />                chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again <br />towards<br />      the<br />          end.</p>
<p>                2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - <br />III - V<br />          (nice..<br />              different<br />                from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>                3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />          (Ninaiththathu<br />                paLiththathu) .. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which <br />follows a I-<br />      III-<br />          V-IV-<br />              VII<br />                resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>                4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression<br />      before<br />              getting to<br />                IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like <br />that.<br />          Creates<br />              a<br />                certain tension that can ONLY be released by <br />resolving to<br />      the I,<br />              which is<br />                done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is <br />played. I<br />      have<br />              found that<br />                I usually love songs that do this uniformally. . <br />(also songs<br />          where<br />              there are<br />                scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>                5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# <br />into the<br />      mix.<br />              Now this is<br />                obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to <br />tell the<br />          Maestro<br />              that :)<br />                It creates a very nice effect.</p>
<p>                Regards,</p>
<p>                Arun</p>

        <p>Dear Udanx, yes I like this debate!! I am not that familiar with cricketingtechniques although I really like the game - but I get what you are tryingto say.

<p>Malathi,</p>
<p>We are talking about talent not about the?philanthropic activities of people in the Cine field. I do have the highest regards for people who do all this ... That too with out a hint of publicity that they are doing that. But thats not in the main stream discussion of this thread.?</p>
<p>Also earning money thats also not counted as there are other music directors who have made loads of money which IR can never ever think of.</p>
<p>So lets lets discuss music alone</p>
<p>Talent / Exposure to music / Chances of learning music when they were young/ Surroundings ...</p>
<p>Knowledge of music (Carnatic / Hindustani / Western Classic)<br />Application of what they learned<br />Innovation / Experiments in their field<br />Having said that I am a great fan of Mr.MSV / Mr.KVM. I have not?analyzedMr.KVM very critically to some extent Mr.MSV. Again I will tell you the difference in cricketing terms (In which I am at home)?In olden days?Leg Glance or Flick is played when the ball is pitching on leg stump and leaving the leg stump. Playing that shot is not everybody's forte. Few played it well.</p>
<p>But it was GR Vishwanath who re-defined the flick / leg glance. Even if theball pitches on off stump and moves towards middle stump he would flick the ball and it will run to boundary. He would do this effortlessly . Improvisation at its best. Defying the?grammar?of music I have given examples in my earlier posy\t.?</p>
<p>Similarly late cut between Wicket Keeper and 1st slip / 1st slip and 2nd slip / Slip and Gully. All these need little variation in his hand grip, openthe face of the bat and timing. Similarly moving from one Raga to another Rage and then coming back to the rage where he started -- IR is a master inthat.</p>
<p>Vishy use to play shots in a area where there is no fielder. The bowling captain would move a fielder to the position where Vishy scored runs. Immediately Vishy would play a shot into the place from where the fielder was moved. IR would compose on Ragas which others would not even think of.</p>
<p>Laters!?</p>

<p>Udanx, I have no problems with anyone calling IR a legend or for that matter appreciating how much effort it took for him to reach where he was.<br />?<br />Also to remember - olden days musicians did not make a fraction of money that IR did.Many of them did not even have their name mentioned in the credits occasionally. KVM helped many younger musicians without his name mentioned - including MSV and Ghantasala. Ghantasala in turn helped several people like TV Raju and even SP Balasubramaiam with no credit at all and he sang?many of his own songs since he could not afford playback singers, he wasa very good singer but in spite of that.?In fact it was SPB who erected a statue for his guru/master as he called him very recently.? Ghantasala died of throat cancer and insisting on singing even until the very last day. Mohammed Rafi up north was very similar. Rafi used to send anonymous money contributions in fact to struggling young playback artistes.</p>
<p>There is no one person or one anyone who is above and beyond others. Kalai ulagam is a contribution of multiple people. <br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Arun,<br />?<br />I have high regards / respects to all the music doyens. ?But in my opinion?one cannot put the work of IR?in simple words, as mentioned in your mail. He took the?"BEST" from every form of music - Carnatic / Hindustani / Western Classical.?He used this knowledge and fused them together?when he composed songs.<br />?<br />For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal training in music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in his pocket, analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying them to filmmusic ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than done. IfI start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this forum. For me other musicians great people /doyens and this man is a LEGEND.<br />?<br />~ Udanx</p>

<p>A veritable fount of information! :) Thanks for all that.<br />I always wondered why KVM didn't do more movies in Tamizh.. Shankarabharanam was KVM right?<br />Great songs!</p>
<p>The thing about IR was that he made songs based on classical ragas but madethem in such a way that it was easily hummable by the masses.. amazing.</p>

<p>Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was Madurai <br />Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was Ghantasala <br />at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let the <br />movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing. <br />Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in <br />Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great <br />but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or <br />cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he has used <br />many ragas and many singers.</p>
<p>Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies <br />bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another <br />one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie <br />mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African <br />samba music is another treat. </p>
<p>KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's <br />guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai <br />AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute <br />work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to <br />telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone (until <br />IR came on the seen again).</p>

<p>    Arun, I learnt classical music from movies too!! I had a strong<br />    aversion of the way classical music was taught - rigid ways with<br />    little creative force and hero worship of musicians,strong caste<br />    factors - so I learnt from movies and after grade 9 attended <br />classes<br />    and learnt formally. Some generic fyi on old tamil classical <br />songs in<br />    case you are interested.. .</p>
<p>    G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman( SV Sekar's dad who gave music for <br />MSS's<br />    Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin<br />    Mummoorthigal in those days.</p>
<p>    Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - Devadas is an<br />    evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's <br />unbearable<br />    Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the most<br />    famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU <br />Chinnappa's<br />    clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />    (Shankarabharanam) . I can't recall more on CR right away. G<br />    Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's guru.<br />    Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna<br />    Ramayanam... Wow what a list and most of them classical treats. Who<br />    can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama <br />puthiran<br />    or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used Mukari <br />that<br />    way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the MLV <br />song to<br />    Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai Veeran.</p>
<p>    There are amazing directors in other languages as far as classical<br />    music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala in<br />    Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil<br />    too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.</p>
<p>    IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to <br />give<br />    him credit for that, and his creativity/innovati on is perhaps</p></dmaloo@...></p></blockquote>

<p>          Aah Raja the Great... it is truly wonderful to listen to his<br />        creations and<br />          one can appreciate it at so many different levels.. carnatic<br />        classical or<br />          western.. here is something I had written on a Guitar forum <br />on<br />    Madai<br />          Thiranthu.. this might not be everyone's cup of tea but <br />just to<br />        give you a<br />          flavor for how we can all appreciate Raja in our own way:</p>
<p>          Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and <br />discusses<br />    the<br />        tamil<br />          song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/ progression<br />    etc. I<br />        doubt it<br />          will be of too much interest to people other than those who<br />    follow<br />        tamil<br />          songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>          I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to <br />the<br />        song "Madai<br />          Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>          I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is <br />the<br />        original one<br />          since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but <br />it<br />        still works.<br />          If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />    around.</p>
<p>          Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>          A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>          The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>          A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>          (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have <br />found<br />    that<br />        it<br />          usually helps to understand the scale first before going on <br />to<br />    the<br />        chords).</p>
<p>          The other thing to note is that you could call this the <br />A#maj<br />    Scale<br />        or the<br />          Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj <br />scale.<br />    (On<br />        the<br />          fretboard, you can identify this by going down three <br />semitones<br />        (half notes)<br />          to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and<br />    chords<br />        remain<br />          the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. <br />On<br />    second<br />          thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />    this<br />        the Gmin<br />          Scale.</p>
<p>          Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief <br />discussion:</p>
<p>          Dm Gm A# Dm<br />          Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>          Dm Gm A# Dm<br />          Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>
<p>          Dm Cm Gm<br />          Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram</p>
<p>          Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />          Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu</p>
<p>          Intro - 1<br />          ---------</p>
<p>          Stanza - 1<br />          ==========</p>
<p>          Dm A# Gm A#<br />          Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu</p>
<p>          Dm A# Gm A#<br />          Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>          Cm Cm Cm A#<br />          Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>          A# A# A# Cm<br />          Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>          Cm Dm<br />          YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>          The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>          A few things to note:</p>
<p>          In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>          Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>          I IV V</p>
<p>          where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and <br />dominant of<br />    the<br />        scale.</p>
<p>          1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves <br />to the<br />        tonic (Gm)<br />          at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this <br />interesting<br />        because<br />          usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />    follow<br />        some<br />          chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards <br />the<br />    end.</p>
<p>          2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />    (nice..<br />        different<br />          from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>          3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />    (Ninaiththathu<br />          paLiththathu) .. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />III-<br />    V-IV-<br />        VII<br />          resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>          4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression <br />before<br />        getting to<br />          IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that.<br />    Creates<br />        a<br />          certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to <br />the I,<br />        which is<br />          done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I <br />have<br />        found that<br />          I usually love songs that do this uniformally. . (also songs<br />    where<br />        there are<br />          scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>          5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the <br />mix.<br />        Now this is<br />          obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />    Maestro<br />        that :)<br />          It creates a very nice effect.</p>
<p>          Regards,</p>
