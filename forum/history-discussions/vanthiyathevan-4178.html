<p>I am sure you have read all this before going to the second volume.....</p>
<p>would you say Karikala wasnt valiant because a asiriri laed him to Virapandiyan?</p>
<p>Ilayapallavan looses his sword to Kanjana devi.....is saved from the courts of Kalinga by Kanjana Devi.....is saved from death from the horses by Amir.....but he is alrger than life</p>
<p>please for heavens sake stop calling him an idiot because however Kalki potrays him he was a great statsman and admistrater of the Mideaval Chola empire He was Rajendra's Samandhanayakar for gods sake<br />regards</p>

<p>    Hi Arun,</p>
<p>    I am not sure about Kadal Pura as I always felt it<br />  as a boring book <br />  to read.<br />    But <br />    I finished Three Muskateers. As far as I could see<br />  Vanthiyathevan is<br />    portraitred as<br />    no less heroic than any of them. Yeah he was<br />  lucky, but fortune <br />  favours the <br />    brave.</p>
<p>    he was brave enough to take a spear meant for<br />  another is one <br />  instance enough<br />    for his heroism,<br />    also, he was a figther and a spy, not a detective <br />  to deduce things. <br />  really<br />    his quick wit and<br />    braveness has brought him the fan following.</p>

<p>          Dear All,</p>
<p>          I am sure this will raise some hackles but<br />  that never stopped <br />  me<br />          before. :) I do believe that Vanthiyathevan,<br />  as portrayed by <br />  Kalki in PS is<br />          one of the less "heroic" heros that I have<br />  read in any book. <br />  He is more like<br />          a bumbling fool, albeit a very lucky one. He<br />  mostly has <br />  others come and bail<br />          him out of difficulties. Time and again, he<br />  stumbles across <br />  things and<br />          events more or less catch up to him rather <br />  than his shaping <br />  things. Maybe<br />          Kalki wanted to portray exactly that.. that<br />  he was like a <br />  leaf caught in the<br />          Chola war-of-succession maelstrom but that's <br />  what it looks <br />  like to me.</p>

<p>    No problem if you call the real VT as idiot. We dont<br />    know much about him. He belongs to real Kundhavai and<br />    history. But Kalki's VT is fully ours. We know most of<br />    him. You dared to call our VT as idiot and I think you<br />    do this to draw maximum out of our members. Go on. You<br />    will get it.

<p>      Dear Sri,</p>
<p>      Ok, I believe you are mixing Vanthiyathevan,<br />      Kunthavai's real life husband<br />      with Vanthiyathevan, the character. When I called<br />      Vanthiyathevan a bumbling<br />      idiot, it was the character I was referring to. The<br />      character as portrayed<br />      by Kalki. Frankly, to my view, he still seems to be<br />      someone who is very<br />      brave, very loyal but still bumbles from incident to<br />      incident, mostly by<br />      chance. Again, this is the character we are talking<br />      about, not the<br />      historical personality :)</p>

SHE hides him.. she takes him on her<br />      boat.. the idiot jumps off the<br />          boat.. she rescues him... she finds out at<br />      Boodhaththeevu about the<br />          whereabouts of ArulMozhi..</p>

<p>            He was committed in his goals</p>
<p>            its all those which make him a great hero</p>
<p>            secondly its in our mindset that hero always<br />    finds<br />            a way out and doesnt need anybody else..its<br />    his<br />            quick wit which gets him out of ravidasan<br />            its his valaour which saves him from the<br />    arabians<br />            so please dont write him off<br />            Sri<br />            Arun Krishnan &lt;    <br />  drarunkrishnan@...<drarunkrishnan%40gmail.com  <br />          wrote:<br />            Venketesh,</drarunkrishnan%40gmail.com></p>

        <p>Hi Arun,<br />A very Happy New Year from Germany.</p>
<p>I think you have started a discussion which will attract lot of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  devotees.</p>
<p>I myself think it is not correct the way how use the word "bumbling idiot". Kalki created<br />the character <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  as a young man (ilam pillai) who is brave, playful, quick in wits and<br />cheeky. He is a sort of person who does things before thinking deeply about it. I mean at 20 I <br />wasn?t much different. The youth, and adventurous nature makes people to react in such<br />manner. As you said if Karikalan would have sent Nambi instead of <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  things would have<br />been different but in a different way of spin. Nambi is a perfect spy but not a warrior. As it is <br />mentioned <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  a warrior has been requested by Karikalan to bring the message to his father<br />at any means.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Moreover if have read Alexandre Dumas? The Three Muskeeters you will find that Kalki has <br />taken the character of D?rtagnan and formed it in <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym ?s character. I mean you wouldn?t call<br />D?rtagnan a bumbling idiot because instead of looking after his own business he tends to <br />duell with almost everybody. As I recall the same situation of being a bumbling idiot happens<br />to him as well. I think Dumas?and Kalki tried to show their characters as being a young<br />fearless and cheeky sort of fellows who goes through walls with head if necessary.</acronym></p>
<p>If you read the 5 th volume you will find the situation where <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  is quite matured and at the<br />is dead) vandhiya devan will be a different man. All his playfulness and recklessness will be<br />gone from him. He will be a very matured, thoughtful and kind hearted person. The spirit<br />of Manimekala deivam will be with him. ". This is also an example of kalki?s character of <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym .</p>
<p>So please try to avoid saying <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  is a bumbling idiot. It hurts people who are really fascinated<br />and sometimes takes a sort of time journey to these periods to feel and enjoy. </acronym></p>
<p>with warm regards</p>

<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>I jumped into volume two without rereading volume 1. So please wait a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  before I answer your Q. Also, as I read volume 2, and find more instances of bumbling idiocies :p I shall let you know. I still believe if I were Karikalan, I would have sent someone more like Aazhwarkadiyaan Nambi as a thoothu.. rather than an impetuous, immature but brave and loyal friend. :) </p>

<p>Arun has raised a valuable question </p>
<p>a great strength of Kalkis writing which is making his charectors as human as possible. <br />Even arulmozhi enters Thanjavur as Vanadhi's Yanaipagan...<br />That was the very fact why everyone loves his charectors as they have identified themselves with one charector or more...</p>

<p>Vanthiyathevan a bumbling idiot, it was the character I was <br />referring to. The character as portrayed by Kalki. Frankly, to my <br />view, he still seems to be someone who is very brave, very loyal but <br />still bumbles from incident to incident, mostly by chance.

<p>    No problem if you call the real VT as idiot. We<br />  dont<br />    know much about him. He belongs to real Kundhavai<br />  and<br />    history. But Kalki's VT is fully ours. We know<br />  most of<br />    him. You dared to call our VT as idiot and I think<br />  you<br />    do this to draw maximum out of our members. Go on.<br />  You<br />    will get it. Soon you will have my share too!</p>

<p>      Dear Sri,</p>
<p>      Ok, I believe you are mixing Vanthiyathevan,<br />      Kunthavai's real life husband<br />      with Vanthiyathevan, the character. When I<br />  called<br />      Vanthiyathevan a bumbling<br />      idiot, it was the character I was referring to.<br />  The<br />      character as portrayed<br />      by Kalki. Frankly, to my view, he still seems to<br />  be<br />      someone who is very<br />      brave, very loyal but still bumbles from<br />  incident to<br />      incident, mostly by<br />      chance. Again, this is the character we are<br />  talking<br />      about, not the<br />      historical personality :)</p>

<p>          please for heavens sake stop calling him an<br />      idiot because however Kalki<br />          potrays him he was a great statsman and<br />      admistrater of the Mideaval Chola<br />          empire He was Rajendra's Samandhanayakar for<br />      gods sake<br />          regards</p>

<p>          Well I am rereading it now.. (PS I mean)..<br />  and<br />      started the second<br />          book.. so Vanthiyathevan goes to<br />  Kodikkarai..<br />      meets Poonguzhali... falls<br />          into a ditch... is rescued by her.. she<br />  tells<br />      him about people looking for<br />          him.. SHE hides him.. she takes him on her<br />      boat.. the idiot jumps off the<br />          boat.. she rescues him... she finds out at<br />      Boodhaththeevu about the<br />          whereabouts of ArulMozhi..</p>

<p>No problem if you call the real <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  as idiot. We dont<br />know much about him. He belongs to real Kundhavai and<br />history. But Kalki's <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  is fully ours. We know most of<br />him. You dared to call our <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  as idiot and I think you<br />do this to draw maximum out of our members. Go on. You<br />will get it. Soon you will have my share too!</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Sri,</p>
<p>  Ok, I believe you are mixing Vanthiyathevan,<br />  Kunthavai's real life husband<br />  with Vanthiyathevan, the character. When I called<br />  Vanthiyathevan a bumbling<br />  idiot, it was the character I was referring to. The<br />  character as portrayed<br />  by Kalki. Frankly, to my view, he still seems to be<br />  someone who is very<br />  brave, very loyal but still bumbles from incident to<br />  incident, mostly by<br />  chance. Again, this is the character we are talking<br />  about, not the<br />  historical personality :)</p>

<p>      I am sure you have read all this before going to<br />  the second volume.....</p>
<p>      would you say Karikala wasnt valiant because a<br />  asiriri laed him to<br />      Virapandiyan?</p>
<p>      Ilayapallavan looses his sword to Kanjana<br />  devi.....is saved from the<br />      courts of Kalinga by Kanjana Devi.....is saved<br />  from death from the horses by<br />      Amir.....but he is alrger than life</p>

<p>      Well I am rereading it now.. (PS I mean).. and<br />  started the second<br />      book.. so Vanthiyathevan goes to Kodikkarai..<br />  meets Poonguzhali... falls<br />      into a ditch... is rescued by her.. she tells<br />  him about people looking for<br />      him.. SHE hides him.. she takes him on her<br />  boat.. the idiot jumps off the<br />      boat.. she rescues him... she finds out at<br />  Boodhaththeevu about the<br />      whereabouts of ArulMozhi..</p>
<p>      now YOU tell me what particular aspect of his<br />  intelligence and verve and<br />      wit has Vanthiyathevan demonstrated here :)</p>

<p>        If we belive that a hero deinitely has to do<br />        everything by himself, then Vandhiyadevan may<br />  not be<br />        the choice.</p>
<p>        He is defnitley lucky but not a bumbling<br />  idiot. The<br />        way the stoy goes, it gives me a feeling that<br />  he uses<br />        his brain and quick wits to overcome any<br />  danger. So I<br />        think he indeed is a hero.</p>

<p>          Vandhiyadevan couldnt swim</p>
<p>          He was valiant and has only lost to superior<br />          warriors Arulmozhi though it is due to<br />  surprise and<br />          poonguzhlais distraction...</p>

<p>    I jumped into volume two without rereading volume 1. So please wait<br />  a bit<br />    before I answer your Q. Also, as I read volume 2, and find more<br />  instances of<br />    bumbling idiocies :p I shall let you know. I still believe if I were<br />    Karikalan, I would have sent someone more like Aazhwarkadiyaan<br />  Nambi as a<br />    thoothu.. rather than an impetuous, immature but brave and loyal<br />  friend. :)</p>

<p>        Ok, I believe you are mixing Vanthiyathevan, Kunthavai's real<br />  life<br />      husband with Vanthiyathevan, the character. When I called<br />      Vanthiyathevan a bumbling idiot, it was the character I was<br />      referring to. The character as portrayed by Kalki. Frankly, to my<br />      view, he still seems to be someone who is very brave, very loyal<br />  but<br />      still bumbles from incident to incident, mostly by chance. Again,<br />      this is the character we are talking about, not the historical<br />      personality :)</p>

As far as I could see<br />  Vanthiyathevan is<br />    portraitred as<br />    no less heroic than any of them. Yeah he was<br />  lucky, but fortune <br />  favours the <br />    brave.</p>
<p>    he was brave enough to take a spear meant for<br />  another is one <br />  instance enough<br />    for his heroism,<br />    also, he was a figther and a spy, not a detective <br />  to deduce things. <br />  really<br />    his quick wit and<br />    braveness has brought him the fan following.</p>

<p>          I am sure this will raise some hackles but <br />  that never stopped <br />  me<br />          before. :) I do believe that Vanthiyathevan,<br />  as portrayed by <br />  Kalki in PS is<br />          one of the less "heroic" heros that I have <br />  read in any book. <br />  He is more like<br />          a bumbling fool, albeit a very lucky one. He<br />  mostly has <br />  others come and bail<br />          him out of difficulties. Time and again, he <br />  stumbles across <br />  things and<br />          events more or less catch up to him rather <br />  than his shaping <br />  things. Maybe<br />          Kalki wanted to portray exactly that.. that <br />  he was like a <br />  leaf caught in the<br />          Chola war-of-succession maelstrom but that's <br />  what it looks <br />  like to me.</p>

<p>Ok, I believe you are mixing Vanthiyathevan, Kunthavai's real life husband<br />with Vanthiyathevan, the character. When I called Vanthiyathevan a bumbling<br />idiot, it was the character I was referring to. The character as portrayed<br />by Kalki. Frankly, to my view, he still seems to be someone who is very<br />brave, very loyal but still bumbles from incident to incident, mostly by<br />chance. Again, this is the character we are talking about, not the<br />historical personality :)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>          I am not sure about Kadal Pura as I always felt it<br />        as a boring book<br />        to read.<br />          But<br />          I finished Three Muskateers. As far as I could see<br />        Vanthiyathevan is<br />          portraitred as<br />          no less heroic than any of them. Yeah he was<br />        lucky, but fortune<br />        favours the<br />          brave.</p>
<p>          he was brave enough to take a spear meant for<br />        another is one<br />        instance enough<br />          for his heroism,<br />          also, he was a figther and a spy, not a detective<br />        to deduce things.<br />        really<br />          his quick wit and<br />          braveness has brought him the fan following.</p>

<p>                Dear All,</p>
<p>                I am sure this will raise some hackles but<br />        that never stopped<br />        me<br />                before. :) I do believe that Vanthiyathevan,<br />        as portrayed by<br />        Kalki in PS is<br />                one of the less "heroic" heros that I have<br />        read in any book.<br />        He is more like<br />                a bumbling fool, albeit a very lucky one. He<br />        mostly has<br />        others come and bail<br />                him out of difficulties. Time and again, he<br />        stumbles across<br />        things and<br />                events more or less catch up to him rather<br />        than his shaping<br />        things. Maybe<br />                Kalki wanted to portray exactly that.. that<br />        he was like a<br />        leaf caught in the<br />                Chola war-of-succession maelstrom but that's<br />        what it looks<br />        like to me.</p>

<p>      surely not a bumbling idiot.<br />      anyone with so many experiences would not have a<br />      definite plan of<br />      action???<br />      right</p>

<p>        Hi Arun,</p>
<p>        I am not sure about Kadal Pura as I always felt it<br />      as a boring book<br />      to read.<br />        But<br />        I finished Three Muskateers. As far as I could see<br />      Vanthiyathevan is<br />        portraitred as<br />        no less heroic than any of them. Yeah he was<br />      lucky, but fortune<br />      favours the<br />        brave.</p>
<p>        he was brave enough to take a spear meant for<br />      another is one<br />      instance enough<br />        for his heroism,<br />        also, he was a figther and a spy, not a detective<br />      to deduce things.<br />      really<br />        his quick wit and<br />        braveness has brought him the fan following.</p>

<p>          Hi Siva,</p>
<p>          There are lots.. if you look at historical<br />      novels in english..</p>
<p>          well "The count of monte christo" is one..<br />      another would be<br />      D'Artagnan<br />          from the Three Musketeers"..<br />      enterprising<br />      lad.. sure<br />          there are instances were luck plays a part but<br />      they also create<br />      their own<br />          luck sometimes through their daring and<br />      bravado...</p>
<p>          :)</p>

<p>            May I know your favorite hero from other book<br />      you have<br />      mentioned? I will<br />            comment about this after your<br />            reply.</p>

<p>              Dear All,</p>
<p>              I am sure this will raise some hackles but<br />      that never stopped<br />      me<br />              before. :) I do believe that Vanthiyathevan,<br />      as portrayed by<br />      Kalki in PS is<br />              one of the less "heroic" heros that I have<br />      read in any book.<br />      He is more like<br />              a bumbling fool, albeit a very lucky one. He<br />      mostly has<br />      others come and bail<br />              him out of difficulties. Time and again, he<br />      stumbles across<br />      things and<br />              events more or less catch up to him rather<br />      than his shaping<br />      things. Maybe<br />              Kalki wanted to portray exactly that.. that<br />      he was like a<br />      leaf caught in the<br />              Chola war-of-succession maelstrom but that's<br />      what it looks<br />      like to me.</p>
