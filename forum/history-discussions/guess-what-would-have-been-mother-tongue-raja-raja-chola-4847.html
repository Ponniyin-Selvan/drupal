<p>Sri.Nilakanta sastry in his pioneering work<br />History of South india (OUP)<br />says that ...during the historical night of kalbra's<br />period the members of chola dynasty fled to present<br />day AP and founded a dynasty called CHODA GANGA<br />dynasty. CHODA is derived from CHOLA. And after a<br />period of appx 3 centuries parantaka chola captured<br />thanjavur and set up a chola kingdom there which later<br />became a chola empire under the<br />able leadership of raja raja and his<br />more illustrious son rajendra.</p>

Human evolution has<br />  been<br />      spontaneous and there are always super humans<br />  and<br />      normal / under evolved humans on earth.<br />      Comparitively, New york is more developed than a<br />      remote village in Africa or the aborginees of<br />      australia. In about a few thousand years later,<br />  when<br />      the world graphics change and it reconstructs<br />  itself<br />      (as it did during the ice age), there may be a<br />  place<br />      where the future archeologists will<br />      find that we did not exist and the native<br />      australians were the first ones to figure out<br />      farming. </p>
<p>      Again this is a theory and logical. There are<br />      relative figuratives when we look to religion to<br />      side with this theory though. for ex: those who<br />      believe in hinduism can say that Super humans<br />      (persons like Rama / ravana etc) coexisted with<br />      humans ( common men / sages etc) and super<br />  evolved<br />      animals (hanuman etc). In short creation has<br />  been<br />      spontanic and there is no practical timeline to<br />      adjudicate the fact that this event happened<br />  only at<br />      this point in time etc. These are guidelines for<br />      this era. Creation (shristi) has been<br />  simultaneous<br />      and we are only working on a sequential program<br />  once<br />      we figure out the non sequential process of<br />  creation<br />      it will give various answers to unsolved<br />  mysteries.</p>
<p>      Hence, according to me, the real origins of<br />  physical<br />      findings on 1st tamil sangam are a very<br />  difficult<br />      pill to swallow. There can be only logical<br />      conclusions. <br />      I will try and attach some old scriptings on<br />      languages for references.</p>

<p>      wheel, and agriculture were the primary<br />  instruments<br />      of an advancing <br />      civilisation.</p>
<p>      Most historians regard the wheel as one of the<br />      oldest and most <br />      important inventions, which originated in<br />  ancient<br />      Sumer in <br />      Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in the 5th millennium<br />  BC,<br />      originally in the <br />      function of potter's wheels. The wheel reached<br />      India and Pakistan <br />      with the Indus Valley Civilization in the 3rd<br />      millennium BC</p>
<p>      so did lemuria function with out a wheel?</p>
<p>      LEMURIA</p>
<p>      Geologists today regard sunken continents as<br />      physical <br />      impossibilities, given the isostatic<br />  equilibrium of<br />      continental <br />      plates floating on the thermoplastic mantle.</p>
<p>      Though the living modern lemurs are only found<br />  in<br />      Madagascar and <br />      several surrounding islands, the biogeography<br />  of<br />      extinct lemurs <br />      extending from Pakistan to Malaysia inspired<br />  the<br />      name Lemuria, which <br />      was coined in 1864 by the geologist Philip<br />  Sclater<br />      in an article "The <br />      Mammals of Madagascar" in The Quarterly Journal<br />  of<br />      Science. Puzzled <br />      by the presence of fossil lemurs in both<br />  Madagascar<br />      and India, but <br />      not in Africa nor the Middle East, Sclater<br />  proposed<br />      that Madagascar <br />      and India had once been part of a larger<br />  continent,<br />      which he named <br />      "Lemuria" for its lemurs.</p>
<p>      Sclater's theory was hardly unusual for his<br />  time.<br />      The acceptance of <br />      Darwinism led scientists to seek to trace the<br />      diffusion of species <br />      from their points of evolutionary origin; prior<br />  to<br />      the acceptance of <br />      continental drift, biologists frequently<br />  postulated<br />      submerged land <br />      masses in order to account for populations of<br />      land-based species now <br />      separated by barriers of water. </p>
<p>      In 1999, drilling by the JOIDES Resolution<br />  research<br />      vessel in the <br />      Indian Ocean discovered evidence [1] that a<br />      continent about a third <br />      of the size of Australia sank about 20 million</p>

<p>      Hello</p>
<p>      Personally I think Lemuria sinking is prior to<br />    the age of Mathura's <br />    destruction. Lemuria is quoted as a place where<br />    Mt.Meru is ( a <br />    philosophical quote). <br />      The association of Tamil with Lemuria as Atlantis<br />    to Sanskrit is <br />    somewhat known. Veeramahendra puram and Elangai<br />    (depicted in the <br />    legends) seem to have association with the 1st<br />    tamil sangam. Ages of <br />    those are into the treta yuga and earlier to it<br />    dating the 1st to be <br />    atleast 6000 yrs BC. </p>

<p>        Fiction or not : on a side track: The origins<br />    of<br />        Sangam age have always been very confusing and<br />        debatable, I have read one convincing argument<br />    that<br />        Sangam age was in the Lemuria (for ones who<br />    believe<br />        in one) and prior to the sinking ( &amp;     Tsunamis), the<br />        then Pandya king was made to move his Capital<br />    to a<br />        high land, Then Mathurai with the same model<br />        constructions.

        <p>Again, this is theory as it states in the first words of the genographic project. They talk about human migration again based out of fossils found on earth crust. <br />The theory I believe is much earlier than the proposed genographic project. Again science can only believe what it sees on the senses. What my question would be is the process of reproduction of mankind vs conversion from monkeys or any other evolutionary theories. The timeline, in essence, for genographic project is my concern.</p>

<p>  wheel, and agriculture were the primary instruments<br />  of an advancing <br />  civilisation.</p>
<p>  Most historians regard the wheel as one of the<br />  oldest and most <br />  important inventions, which originated in ancient<br />  Sumer in <br />  Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in the 5th millennium BC,<br />  originally in the <br />  function of potter's wheels. The wheel reached<br />  India and Pakistan <br />  with the Indus Valley Civilization in the 3rd<br />  millennium BC</p>
<p>  so did lemuria function with out a wheel?</p>
<p>  LEMURIA</p>
<p>  Geologists today regard sunken continents as<br />  physical <br />  impossibilities, given the isostatic equilibrium of<br />  continental <br />  plates floating on the thermoplastic mantle.</p>
<p>  Though the living modern lemurs are only found in<br />  Madagascar and <br />  several surrounding islands, the biogeography of<br />  extinct lemurs <br />  extending from Pakistan to Malaysia inspired the<br />  name Lemuria, which <br />  was coined in 1864 by the geologist Philip Sclater<br />  in an article "The <br />  Mammals of Madagascar" in The Quarterly Journal of<br />  Science. Puzzled <br />  by the presence of fossil lemurs in both Madagascar<br />  and India, but <br />  not in Africa nor the Middle East, Sclater proposed<br />  that Madagascar <br />  and India had once been part of a larger continent,<br />  which he named <br />  "Lemuria" for its lemurs.</p>
<p>  Sclater's theory was hardly unusual for his time.<br />  The acceptance of <br />  Darwinism led scientists to seek to trace the<br />  diffusion of species <br />  from their points of evolutionary origin; prior to<br />  the acceptance of <br />  continental drift, biologists frequently postulated<br />  submerged land <br />  masses in order to account for populations of<br />  land-based species now <br />  separated by barriers of water. </p>
<p>  In 1999, drilling by the JOIDES Resolution research<br />  vessel in the <br />  Indian Ocean discovered evidence [1] that a<br />  continent about a third <br />  of the size of Australia sank about 20 million<br />  years ago. Samples <br />  showed pollen and fragments of wood in a 90<br />  million-year-old <br />  sediment. This might lead one to expect similarity<br />  of dinosaur fossil <br />  evidence and will help to understand the breakup of<br />  the Indian and <br />  Australian land masses; it does not support the<br />  concept of Lemuria OF <br />  6TH MILLIENIUM BC</p>

<p>    Hello</p>
<p>    Personally I think Lemuria sinking is prior to<br />  the age of Mathura's <br />  destruction. Lemuria is quoted as a place where<br />  Mt.Meru is ( a <br />  philosophical quote). <br />    The association of Tamil with Lemuria as Atlantis<br />  to Sanskrit is <br />  somewhat known. Veeramahendra puram and Elangai<br />  (depicted in the <br />  legends) seem to have association with the 1st<br />  tamil sangam. Ages of <br />  those are into the treta yuga and earlier to it<br />  dating the 1st to be <br />  atleast 6000 yrs BC. </p>

        <p>The Lemurian (&amp; Atlantis) continent was super developed by the time the reminder of the world was seen to even discovering fire. <br />We can only produce logical conclusions for these facts. For ex: Darwins theory, It is my personal opinion (along with many religious sects) that the theory is flawed and not true, simple question for a layman would be, if Man was to have come from the monkey, why are monkeys not becoming men any more? Geological environmental situations ? I would not buy that. So how does this context relate with Lemurians and the rest of the world. I believe that creations has been simultaneous and not based out of migration from one land to another(which is a by product at some places). Human evolution has been spontaneous and there are always super humans and normal / under evolved humans on earth. Comparitively, New york is more developed than a remote village in Africa or the aborginees of australia. In about a few thousand years later, when the world graphics change and it reconstructs itself (as it did during the ice age), there may be a place where the future archeologists will<br />find that we did not exist and the native australians were the first ones to figure out farming. </p>
<p>Again this is a theory and logical. There are relative figuratives when we look to religion to side with this theory though. for ex: those who believe in hinduism can say that Super humans (persons like Rama / ravana etc) coexisted with humans ( common men / sages etc) and super evolved animals (hanuman etc). In short creation has been spontanic and there is no practical timeline to adjudicate the fact that this event happened only at this point in time etc. These are guidelines for this era. Creation (shristi) has been simultaneous and we are only working on a sequential program once we figure out the non sequential process of creation it will give various answers to unsolved mysteries.</p>
<p>Hence, according to me, the real origins of physical findings on 1st tamil sangam are a very difficult pill to swallow. There can be only logical conclusions. <br />I will try and attach some old scriptings on languages for references.</p>

<p>wheel, and agriculture were the primary instruments of an advancing <br />civilisation.</p>
<p>Most historians regard the wheel as one of the oldest and most <br />important inventions, which originated in ancient Sumer in <br />Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in the 5th millennium BC, originally in the <br />function of potter's wheels. The wheel reached India and Pakistan <br />with the Indus Valley Civilization in the 3rd millennium BC</p>
<p>so did lemuria function with out a wheel?</p>
<p>LEMURIA</p>
<p>Geologists today regard sunken continents as physical <br />impossibilities, given the isostatic equilibrium of continental <br />plates floating on the thermoplastic mantle.</p>
<p>Though the living modern lemurs are only found in Madagascar and <br />several surrounding islands, the biogeography of extinct lemurs <br />extending from Pakistan to Malaysia inspired the name Lemuria, which <br />was coined in 1864 by the geologist Philip Sclater in an article "The <br />Mammals of Madagascar" in The Quarterly Journal of Science. Puzzled <br />by the presence of fossil lemurs in both Madagascar and India, but <br />not in Africa nor the Middle East, Sclater proposed that Madagascar <br />and India had once been part of a larger continent, which he named <br />"Lemuria" for its lemurs.</p>
<p>Sclater's theory was hardly unusual for his time. The acceptance of <br />Darwinism led scientists to seek to trace the diffusion of species <br />from their points of evolutionary origin; prior to the acceptance of <br />continental drift, biologists frequently postulated submerged land <br />masses in order to account for populations of land-based species now <br />separated by barriers of water. </p>
<p>In 1999, drilling by the JOIDES Resolution research vessel in the <br />Indian Ocean discovered evidence [1] that a continent about a third <br />of the size of Australia sank about 20 million years ago. Samples <br />showed pollen and fragments of wood in a 90 million-year-old <br />sediment. This might lead one to expect similarity of dinosaur fossil <br />evidence and will help to understand the breakup of the Indian and <br />Australian land masses; it does not support the concept of Lemuria OF <br />6TH MILLIENIUM BC</p>

<p>    DEAR NANDA :: FOR QUICK RECOLLECTION : </p>
<p>    AROUND 3RD AD : (TAMIL ) SANGAM AGE. NO<br />    INSCRIPTION. NO STANDING <br />    EVIDENCE. DURING THE BRITISH, ATLEAST TILL<br />    RECENTLY. THANKS TO <br />    TSUNAMI, DR. THIAGA SATHIYAMURTHY (AASAI Founder)<br />    Retd Suptt <br />    Archeologist FOUND &amp; IDENTIFIED A TEMPLE - MURUGA<br />    TEMPLE - WITH <br />    THREE TIER BASEMENT - BRICK - STONE - BRICK AND<br />    ATTRIBUTED TO SAMGAM <br />    AGE. NOW ASI - AFTER SCIENTIFIC TESTS - HAS AGREED<br />    TO THIS TO BE OF <br />    SANGAM AGE TEMPLE - STANDING EVIDENCE. </p>
<p>    3RD TO 5TH AD :: KALABRAS. SPECULATIONS OF THEIR<br />    ORIGIN.. INCLUDING <br />    WHETHER THEY ARE JAINS... KAADVARKON PANDYA IS<br />    CONSIDERED KALABRA - <br />    WHO IS DESIGNATED NAAYANMAR.</p>
<p>    6 to 8th AD :: " Jithath Simha Vishnu, Thanja <br />    Haraha " is the <br />    inscription (as you rightly mentioned ) in Saskrit<br />    - in Rock Fort <br />    Temple, Trichy, CONFIRMING that Trichy - Thanjavur<br />    - Cauvery Belt <br />    was under Pallava Rule from Simhavishnu Days ..</p>
<p>    Around 850 AD : (Recall PS - Kalki - Chozha<br />    details) :: Vijayalayan <br />    conquored and occupied Thanjai. Thiruvalangadu<br />    Copper plates are <br />    silent on the Mutharayas who were subdued. Our<br />    Group has discussed <br />    this extensively - thanks to Srilankan member<br />    SriHari :: SAATAN <br />    PAZHIYILI was the Mutharaya - who constructed a<br />    Siva temple and <br />    named after him as Pazhayileeswaram in Naarthamalai<br />    (enroute <br />    Pudukkottai from Trichy) - around mid 9th century<br />    (850 or so ). But <br />    from Senthalai (Near Nemam / Thirukkaattupalli<br />    inscriptions) we have <br />    KAVARAN MAARAN and Co., as Mutharayas operated from<br />    Thanjavur around <br />    that period. So it was postulated that Two Sects<br />    of Mutharayas - <br />    one Around the bordering with Pandyas at <br />    Pudukkottai and other sect <br />    at Nemam - close to Thanjai and most probably this<br />    sect of <br />    Mutharayas would have been conquered by<br />    Vijayalayan.</p>
<p>    Dr. Nagaswamy, on his study of Muthurasas<br />    postulated that the <br />    VRIDHARAJA found at Mysore around 5th AD are<br />    MUTHURAJAS from TN who <br />    paved way for this sect and probably this is time<br />    for evolution of <br />    Kannada language !</p>
<p>    Therefore with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions (pre<br />    Sangam) - Adhiyaman <br />    period inscriptions in Thirukkoilore / Dharmapuri<br />    (Sangam period), <br />    we have Sanskrit / Grantha mix inscriptions<br />    followed and then Tamil <br />    inscriptions again.... with Sankrit separated. For<br />    instance <br />    Thiruvalangadu Copper plates copper plates<br />    (Released by Rajendra I) <br />    comprised of Sanskrit Verses first followed by<br />    Tamil scripts..</p>
<p>    PLEASE PLACE KARIKALA around 500 -550 AD only.</p>
<p>    Telugu / Kannada / Malayam are of later period in<br />    comparison with <br />    Tamil - almost in that Order.</p>

        <p>Hello</p>
<p>Personally I think Lemuria sinking is prior to the age of Mathura's destruction. Lemuria is quoted as a place where Mt.Meru is ( a philosophical quote). <br />The association of Tamil with Lemuria as Atlantis to Sanskrit is somewhat known. Veeramahendra puram and Elangai (depicted in the legends) seem to have association with the 1st tamil sangam. Ages of those are into the treta yuga and earlier to it dating the 1st to be atleast 6000 yrs BC. </p>

<p>  DEAR NANDA :: FOR QUICK RECOLLECTION : </p>
<p>  AROUND 3RD AD : (TAMIL ) SANGAM AGE. NO<br />  INSCRIPTION. NO STANDING <br />  EVIDENCE. DURING THE BRITISH, ATLEAST TILL<br />  RECENTLY. THANKS TO <br />  TSUNAMI, DR. THIAGA SATHIYAMURTHY (AASAI Founder)<br />  Retd Suptt <br />  Archeologist FOUND &amp; IDENTIFIED A TEMPLE - MURUGA<br />  TEMPLE - WITH <br />  THREE TIER BASEMENT - BRICK - STONE - BRICK AND<br />  ATTRIBUTED TO SAMGAM <br />  AGE. NOW ASI - AFTER SCIENTIFIC TESTS - HAS AGREED<br />  TO THIS TO BE OF <br />  SANGAM AGE TEMPLE - STANDING EVIDENCE. </p>
<p>  3RD TO 5TH AD :: KALABRAS. SPECULATIONS OF THEIR<br />  ORIGIN.. INCLUDING <br />  WHETHER THEY ARE JAINS... KAADVARKON PANDYA IS<br />  CONSIDERED KALABRA - <br />  WHO IS DESIGNATED NAAYANMAR.</p>
<p>  6 to 8th AD :: " Jithath Simha Vishnu, Thanja <br />  Haraha " is the <br />  inscription (as you rightly mentioned ) in Saskrit<br />  - in Rock Fort <br />  Temple, Trichy, CONFIRMING that Trichy - Thanjavur<br />  - Cauvery Belt <br />  was under Pallava Rule from Simhavishnu Days ..</p>
<p>  Around 850 AD : (Recall PS - Kalki - Chozha<br />  details) :: Vijayalayan <br />  conquored and occupied Thanjai. Thiruvalangadu<br />  Copper plates are <br />  silent on the Mutharayas who were subdued. Our<br />  Group has discussed <br />  this extensively - thanks to Srilankan member<br />  SriHari :: SAATAN <br />  PAZHIYILI was the Mutharaya - who constructed a<br />  Siva temple and <br />  named after him as Pazhayileeswaram in Naarthamalai<br />  (enroute <br />  Pudukkottai from Trichy) - around mid 9th century<br />  (850 or so ). But <br />  from Senthalai (Near Nemam / Thirukkaattupalli<br />  inscriptions) we have <br />  KAVARAN MAARAN and Co., as Mutharayas operated from<br />  Thanjavur around <br />  that period. So it was postulated that Two Sects<br />  of Mutharayas - <br />  one Around the bordering with Pandyas at <br />  Pudukkottai and other sect <br />  at Nemam - close to Thanjai and most probably this<br />  sect of <br />  Mutharayas would have been conquered by<br />  Vijayalayan.</p>
<p>  Dr. Nagaswamy, on his study of Muthurasas<br />  postulated that the <br />  VRIDHARAJA found at Mysore around 5th AD are<br />  MUTHURAJAS from TN who <br />  paved way for this sect and probably this is time<br />  for evolution of <br />  Kannada language !</p>
<p>  Therefore with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions (pre<br />  Sangam) - Adhiyaman <br />  period inscriptions in Thirukkoilore / Dharmapuri<br />  (Sangam period), <br />  we have Sanskrit / Grantha mix inscriptions<br />  followed and then Tamil <br />  inscriptions again.... with Sankrit separated. For<br />  instance <br />  Thiruvalangadu Copper plates copper plates<br />  (Released by Rajendra I) <br />  comprised of Sanskrit Verses first followed by<br />  Tamil scripts..</p>
<p>  PLEASE PLACE KARIKALA around 500 -550 AD only.</p>
<p>  Telugu / Kannada / Malayam are of later period in<br />  comparison with <br />  Tamil - almost in that Order.</p>
<p>  Linguistic experts may step in and enlighten.</p>

THIAGA SATHIYAMURTHY (AASAI Founder) Retd Suptt <br />Archeologist FOUND &amp; IDENTIFIED A TEMPLE - MURUGA TEMPLE - WITH <br />THREE TIER BASEMENT - BRICK - STONE - BRICK AND ATTRIBUTED TO SAMGAM <br />AGE. NOW <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  - AFTER SCIENTIFIC TESTS - HAS AGREED TO THIS TO BE OF <br />SANGAM AGE TEMPLE - STANDING EVIDENCE. </acronym></p>
<p>3RD TO 5TH AD :: KALABRAS. SPECULATIONS OF THEIR ORIGIN.. INCLUDING <br />WHETHER THEY ARE JAINS... KAADVARKON PANDYA IS CONSIDERED KALABRA - <br />WHO IS DESIGNATED NAAYANMAR.</p>
<p>6 to 8th AD :: " Jithath Simha Vishnu, Thanja Haraha " is the <br />inscription (as you rightly mentioned ) in Saskrit - in Rock Fort <br />Temple, Trichy, CONFIRMING that Trichy - Thanjavur - Cauvery Belt <br />was under Pallava Rule from Simhavishnu Days ..</p>
<p>Around 850 AD : (Recall <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  - Kalki - Chozha details) :: Vijayalayan <br />conquored and occupied Thanjai. Thiruvalangadu Copper plates are <br />silent on the Mutharayas who were subdued. Our Group has discussed <br />this extensively - thanks to Srilankan member SriHari :: SAATAN <br />PAZHIYILI was the Mutharaya - who constructed a Siva temple and <br />named after him as Pazhayileeswaram in Naarthamalai (enroute <br />Pudukkottai from Trichy) - around mid 9th century (850 or so ). But <br />from Senthalai (Near Nemam / Thirukkaattupalli inscriptions) we have <br />KAVARAN MAARAN and Co., as Mutharayas operated from Thanjavur around <br />that period. So it was postulated that Two Sects of Mutharayas - <br />one Around the bordering with Pandyas at Pudukkottai and other sect <br />at Nemam - close to Thanjai and most probably this sect of <br />Mutharayas would have been conquered by Vijayalayan.</acronym></p>
<p>Dr. Nagaswamy, on his study of Muthurasas postulated that the <br />VRIDHARAJA found at Mysore around 5th AD are MUTHURAJAS from TN who <br />paved way for this sect and probably this is time for evolution of <br />Kannada language !</p>
<p>Therefore with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions (pre Sangam) - Adhiyaman <br />period inscriptions in Thirukkoilore / Dharmapuri (Sangam period), <br />we have Sanskrit / Grantha mix inscriptions followed and then Tamil <br />inscriptions again.... with Sankrit separated. For instance <br />Thiruvalangadu Copper plates copper plates (Released by Rajendra I) <br />comprised of Sanskrit Verses first followed by Tamil scripts..</p>
<p>PLEASE PLACE KARIKALA around 500 -550 AD only.</p>
<p>Telugu / Kannada / Malayam are of later period in comparison with <br />Tamil - almost in that Order.</p>

        <p>Vengi naadu was existant and the lineage might be right, however the language what we know of as telugu as it is today may not be the same as the language of yesteryears.</p>
<p>Even the tamil prior to Rajendran's march to the Ganges is different than the tamil after (reading of Thiruvasagam's tamil vs thirupugazh or kambha ramayana both of 1200 - 1400 ad Kulothunga III 's kingdom and later pandya regime after the Chola empire).</p>

<p>Clearly states that that Karikalan is 1-2nd century. I guess you could have mistaken Karikalan for someone else in the 5th - 6th Century in the chola. Clearly we dont know the cholas during the 550AD, isnt that time of the Kalabharas? </p>
<p>Some small doubt, are the early kalabhraras anyway linked into the kallar? kala-phirar and kala-padai? maybe spell it out it could go eerily similar. By the way, started reading V.Kanakasabhai's Tamil eighteen hundred years ago. Very nice book, probably many of us would have read it before.</p>

        <p>I doubt if there were Telugu inscriptions before or during Karikala's time(2century BC-1century AD?) Most of the inscriptions north of Tamilakam were mostly in Prakarit or sanskrit or in Brahmi. This was something I read, butno clear proof or evidences currently available. If for the very same logic or reasoning then Pallavas should be giving their inscriptions in Telugu or a Telugu Brahmi, but clearly no, as they are mostly in Sanskrit or variant. Refer to Mahabalipuram or Kanchi inscriptions from Simhavishnu or Rajasimhan.</p>
<p>Please do correct if my statement seems to be wrong.</p>

<p>The Telugu Cholas claim and are proud of their lineage leading to Karikal perumthirumavalavan , So the Telugu chodas we infact tamils.</p>

        <p>dear friends,<br />it was acutally vijayalaya chola who captured<br />thanjavur from muthhariyar chief then feudtories of<br />pallavas. Hence he was called tanjai konda.....<br />parataka was hailed as madurai konda after he won over<br />the pandyas.<br />nothing can be derived abt kalbras except they were<br />generally considered as evil rulers and there were<br />some exceptions too.<br />here we have to understand one more thing....<br />present day state boundries cannot be a yardstick to<br />ascertain the medieval period linguistic areas.<br />so what can infer is language is no bar to the<br />conquests of mighty chola empire. chola inscriptions<br />were found in tamil, telugu as well as in sanskrit.<br />we must also remember that the well trained army of <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  went as far as present day orissa(kalinga) and it<br />culminated in grand victory over pala kings of bengal<br />during rajendra's reign.<br />this is not over, chola navy crossed the palk strait<br />won over sinhala king of srilanka then crossed bay of<br />bengal to defeat the army of srivijaya .<br />its king vijayatungavarman accepted to be vassal of<br />chola empire. chola navy ransacked kadaram and<br />rajendra was hailed as kadaram konda.<br />chola empire extended upto e .asia and perhaps one of<br />the biggest in the medeival world.for 50 years cholas<br />controled the sea trade and it is generally believed <br />that rajendra undertook the kadaram operation not only<br />to extend the empire but also to check the pirates who<br />troubled indian and chinese merchants and these<br />pirates were encouraged by vijayatungavarman.<br />i hope we can understand the might of chola empire.<br />regards,<br />ramnath.</acronym></p>
<p>reg cheraman perumal...i think in those days in<br />malabar the language prevalant was koodum tamil..a<br />mixture of sanskrit and ancient tamil..forerunner to<br />present day malayalam.</p>

<p>Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Telugu Chodas are different..</p>
<p>the linear branch after <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's children got terminated and Kundavai's <br />branch took over with Kulothunga....</acronym></p>
<p>But Mdvl Chozhas did have matrimonial alliances with Rastrakutas..</p>
<p>Chalukya royal kids did get asylum on the banks of Cauvery in <br />Thanjavur during <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  period.</p>
<p>Thiruvisappa ... Cheraman Perumal's Thirukkayilaya Ula mention <br />what ? The Malabar King was so well-VERSED with Tamil language !</p>

<p>There is difference in naming of the Early Kings and Medivial Kings <br />in TN :: Eg::</p>
<p>KANAIKKAL IRUMPORAI ::: Marthanda Ravi </p>
<p>NEDUNCHEZHIAN ::: Sundara Pandian</p>
<p>KILLI VALAVAN ::: VIJAYALAYAN </p>
<p>This clarifies migration from the North in the intervening period..</p>
<p>Kalbras are postulated to be from Kalahasthi .. among other <br />speculations !</p>
<p>Among Naayanmars, the Kings identified are of Chera, Chozha, Pandya <br />and Kalabra ..</p>
<p><acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastri would have considered more details as well while putting <br />forth certain views..</acronym></p>
<p>NOW with recent finds at Adhichanallur &amp; all, the Cycle appears to <br />be complete..</p>
<p>If Tamil Civilisation is forerunner to Sind, then we are having <br />South - North - South equation is hand !</p>
<p>The thought appears to be interesting..</p>

<p>  Sri.Nilakanta sastry in his pioneering work<br />  History of South india (OUP)<br />  says that ...during the historical night of kalbra's<br />  period the members of chola dynasty fled to present<br />  day AP and founded a dynasty called CHODA GANGA<br />  dynasty. CHODA is derived from CHOLA. And after a<br />  period of appx 3 centuries parantaka chola captured<br />  thanjavur and set up a chola kingdom there which later<br />  became a chola empire under the<br />  able leadership of raja raja and his<br />  more illustrious son rajendra.</p>
