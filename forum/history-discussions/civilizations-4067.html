</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi all,<br />It is really interesting to read about <br />all these discussion on the ability of a <br />civilization to adapt to changes etc. </p>
<p>When do we say with any certainity that <br />a civilization has collapsed? I have come<br />across many arguments about how the Indian<br />civilization is the only oldest one that's <br />in existence continuously from prehistoric <br />times. Is there any truth in that? We may<br />claim ourselves to be part of that great<br />civilization. But if our ancestors time<br />travel and see the present day India they<br />would find themselves among a civilization<br />which is significantly different from <br />theirs.Can anyone in the present day Egypt <br />claim they belong to the civilization that<br />built the Pyramids? If it is so how are we<br />different from the Egyptians? We too have<br />changed completely. The dress we wear, <br />the system of education, governance and to<br />a certain extent even the language that we<br />use are of European origin. I feel it is a<br />completely different civilization which<br />sprang from the mixture of two different<br />civilizations with mutually contradicting<br />philosophies. Looking at the way we have <br />advanced in this new setup it appears that <br />the transformation is irreversible and is<br />proceeding gradually towards obliterating<br />all the traces of our parent civilization.<br />We cannot go back to the glorious parent <br />civilization but we can retain the best<br />components from getting obliterated.<br />Are we going to check this decay at all. <br />If we are going to do that how? I have <br />some ideas. I will write if anyone is <br />interested. But I am sure others have <br />better ideas than mine.</p>
<p>best wishes<br />Anand.</p>

<p>    Hi Deepa,<br />    you do generate a lot of doubts.<br />    good</p>
<p>    I think the egyptians used soapstone carved<br />    containers and leather <br />    bags for water.</p>
<p>    they must have used clay pots but which where<br />    moulded by hand and not <br />    by a wheel. the potters wheel introduced mass<br />    production of pots.</p>

<p>        while some people claim civilisations to be 10<br />    000<br />        years and older  <br />        we should pause to examine.<br />        -The driving force of mankind is the wheel.</p>
<p>        its very difficult to beleive advanced<br />    civilisations<br />        could have <br />        lived without the usage of the wheel.</p>
<p>        the first type of wheel invented was the potters<br />        wheel and then came <br />        its vertical usage.</p>
<p>        this was 5000 bc in sumeria.</p>
<p>        paleoanthropologists now date the emergence of<br />        anatomically modern <br />        humans to ca. 150,000 years ago, 143,000 of<br />    those<br />        years were "wheel-<br />        less"</p>
<p>        the pyramids were built without the use of a<br />    wheeled<br />        vehicle.</p>

<p>  I think the egyptians used soapstone carved<br />  containers and leather <br />  bags for water.</p>
<p>  they must have used clay pots but which where<br />  moulded by hand and not <br />  by a wheel. the potters wheel introduced mass<br />  production of pots.</p>

<p>    Hi</p>
<p>    while some people claim civilisations to be 10 000<br />    years and older  <br />    we should pause to examine.<br />    -The driving force of mankind is the wheel.</p>
<p>    its very difficult to beleive advanced civilisations<br />    could have <br />    lived without the usage of the wheel.</p>
<p>    the first type of wheel invented was the potters<br />    wheel and then came <br />    its vertical usage.</p>
<p>    this was 5000 bc in sumeria.</p>
<p>    paleoanthropologists now date the emergence of<br />    anatomically modern <br />    humans to ca. 150,000 years ago, 143,000 of those<br />    years were "wheel-<br />    less"</p>
<p>    the pyramids were built without the use of a wheeled<br />    vehicle.</p>
<p>    one trivia</p>
<p>    In July 2001, the wheel was patented by an <br />    Australian as a <br />    "circular transportation facilitation device". The<br />    innovation patent <br />    was obtained by John Keogh, a lawyer from Melbourne,<br />    Australia, with <br />    the declared intention of demonstrating flaws in the<br />    recently <br />    introduced innovation patent system</p>

<p>      very few if any civilsation could be older than<br />    10000 years because <br />      that was when the last glaciation period of the<br />    last ice age was <br />    over.<br />      ( inter glacial periods last 12000 years only) and<br />    so if you have <br />    any <br />      important work to finish, try to hurry.<br />      during ice ages and glacial periods men lived off<br />    nature and had <br />    very <br />      few community activity. mostly as cave men.<br />      the first signs of intelligent civilisation<br />    started in sumer( <br />      agriculture, wheel, and language developed one<br />    after another in <br />    quick <br />      succession).sumer is present day iraq.</p>

        <p>Brilliant thought Venkatesh. The <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  about the<br />Australian lawyer is hillarious.

<p>    very few if any civilsation could be older than<br />  10000 years because <br />    that was when the last glaciation period of the<br />  last ice age was <br />  over.<br />    ( inter glacial periods last 12000 years only) and<br />  so if you have <br />  any <br />    important work to finish, try to hurry.<br />    during ice ages and glacial periods men lived off<br />  nature and had <br />  very <br />    few community activity. mostly as cave men.<br />    the first signs of intelligent civilisation<br />  started in sumer( <br />    agriculture, wheel, and language developed one<br />  after another in <br />  quick <br />    succession).sumer is present day iraq.</p>

<p>            Hi all,<br />            It is really interesting to read about<br />            all these discussion on the ability of a<br />            civilization to adapt to changes etc.</p>
<p>            When do we say with any certainity that<br />            a civilization has collapsed? I have come<br />            across many arguments about how the Indian<br />            civilization is the only oldest one that's<br />            in existence continuously from prehistoric<br />            times. Is there any truth in that? We may<br />            claim ourselves to be part of that great<br />            civilization. But if our ancestors time<br />            travel and see the present day India they<br />            would find themselves among a civilization<br />            which is significantly different from<br />            theirs.Can anyone in the present day Egypt<br />            claim they belong to the civilization that<br />            built the Pyramids? If it is so how are we<br />            different from the Egyptians? We too have<br />            changed completely. The dress we wear,<br />            the system of education, governance and to<br />            a certain extent even the language that we<br />            use are of European origin. I feel it is a<br />            completely different civilization which<br />            sprang from the mixture of two different<br />            civilizations with mutually contradicting<br />            philosophies. Looking at the way we have<br />            advanced in this new setup it appears that<br />            the transformation is irreversible and is<br />            proceeding gradually towards obliterating<br />            all the traces of our parent civilization.<br />            We cannot go back to the glorious parent<br />            civilization but we can retain the best<br />            components from getting obliterated.<br />            Are we going to check this decay at all.<br />            If we are going to do that how? I have<br />            some ideas. I will write if anyone is<br />            interested. But I am sure others have<br />            better ideas than mine.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>very few if any civilsation could be older than 10000 years because <br />that was when the last glaciation period of the last ice age was over.<br />( inter glacial periods last 12000 years only) and so if you have any <br />important work to finish, try to hurry.<br />during ice ages and glacial periods men lived off nature and had very <br />few community activity. mostly as cave men.<br />the first signs of intelligent civilisation started in sumer( <br />agriculture, wheel, and language developed one after another in quick <br />succession).sumer is present day iraq.</p>

<p>        Hi all,<br />        It is really interesting to read about<br />        all these discussion on the ability of a<br />        civilization to adapt to changes etc.</p>
<p>        When do we say with any certainity that<br />        a civilization has collapsed? I have come<br />        across many arguments about how the Indian<br />        civilization is the only oldest one that's<br />        in existence continuously from prehistoric<br />        times. Is there any truth in that? We may<br />        claim ourselves to be part of that great<br />        civilization. But if our ancestors time<br />        travel and see the present day India they<br />        would find themselves among a civilization<br />        which is significantly different from<br />        theirs.Can anyone in the present day Egypt<br />        claim they belong to the civilization that<br />        built the Pyramids? If it is so how are we<br />        different from the Egyptians? We too have<br />        changed completely. The dress we wear,<br />        the system of education, governance and to<br />        a certain extent even the language that we<br />        use are of European origin. I feel it is a<br />        completely different civilization which<br />        sprang from the mixture of two different<br />        civilizations with mutually contradicting<br />        philosophies. Looking at the way we have<br />        advanced in this new setup it appears that<br />        the transformation is irreversible and is<br />        proceeding gradually towards obliterating<br />        all the traces of our parent civilization.<br />        We cannot go back to the glorious parent<br />        civilization but we can retain the best<br />        components from getting obliterated.<br />        Are we going to check this decay at all.<br />        If we are going to do that how? I have<br />        some ideas. I will write if anyone is<br />        interested. But I am sure others have<br />        better ideas than mine.</p>

          Civilizations!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Static civilizations die. Period. The only civilizations that last keep<br />changing. Even the Japanese had to undergo the Meiji Restoration in the<br />1800s in order to get rid of the terrible lethargy that had set in because<br />of being totally cut off from the rest of the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi all,<br />  It is really interesting to read about<br />  all these discussion on the ability of a<br />  civilization to adapt to changes etc.</p>
<p>  When do we say with any certainity that<br />  a civilization has collapsed? I have come<br />  across many arguments about how the Indian<br />  civilization is the only oldest one that's<br />  in existence continuously from prehistoric<br />  times. Is there any truth in that? We may<br />  claim ourselves to be part of that great<br />  civilization. But if our ancestors time<br />  travel and see the present day India they<br />  would find themselves among a civilization<br />  which is significantly different from<br />  theirs.Can anyone in the present day Egypt<br />  claim they belong to the civilization that<br />  built the Pyramids? If it is so how are we<br />  different from the Egyptians? We too have<br />  changed completely. The dress we wear,<br />  the system of education, governance and to<br />  a certain extent even the language that we<br />  use are of European origin. I feel it is a<br />  completely different civilization which<br />  sprang from the mixture of two different<br />  civilizations with mutually contradicting<br />  philosophies. Looking at the way we have<br />  advanced in this new setup it appears that<br />  the transformation is irreversible and is<br />  proceeding gradually towards obliterating<br />  all the traces of our parent civilization.<br />  We cannot go back to the glorious parent<br />  civilization but we can retain the best<br />  components from getting obliterated.<br />  Are we going to check this decay at all.<br />  If we are going to do that how? I have<br />  some ideas. I will write if anyone is<br />  interested. But I am sure others have<br />  better ideas than mine.</p>
<p>  best wishes<br />  Anand.</p>
