<p>On 8th July 2002, In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "sv24in" <br /><sumeetha_pb@...  wrote:</p>
<p>Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based <br />on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how <br />to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds while <br />we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />secret about her life.</p>
<p>Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she <br />presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she <br />also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is <br />certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the <br />novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the <br />wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies <br />who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman <br />saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />emory <br />and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall <br />in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of <br />Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />recognize him?</p>
<p>The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi <br />Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back. <br />Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not <br />know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />lighthouse and her last accident. </p>
<p>Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? <br />was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles <br />Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally <br />beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind <br />other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love <br />or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />what happened to her.</p>
<p>Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to <br />her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman <br />finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />Chola household but before he could get this information to the king <br />he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that <br />she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to <br />their mother.</p>
<p>Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the <br />Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br /><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is <br />also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22 <br />years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. <br />Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />daughter.</p>
<p>The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of <br />Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the <br />Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is <br />imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody <br />to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the <br />Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at <br />the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was <br />her father? <br />What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? <br />I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have <br />told her so as well.</p>
<p>But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the <br />presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had <br />realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />logic!</p>
<p>Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him <br />if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a <br />mad rage. </p>
<p>Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She <br />had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in <br />his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan <br />the way she did.    </p>
<p>Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<p>Though we had discussed a lot on this topic, i have a small doubt.<br />Please don't mistake me. My doubt is - </p>
<p>"Is Nandini, a fictional character or Real character who lived in<br />those time? if she is real, what proofs we have for it?"</p>

<p>  When Mandakini jumped off the light house, she was pregnant <br />wasn't she?</p>

<p>possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That has <br />not been mentioned right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani gave <br />birth to twins in "Sembiyan Madevi"s palace and that the replacement <br />happened after a few days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which <br />means right after Senthan amudhan was born, the twins were born. But <br />it is also said When the Pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar <br />happened,kandarathitha chozhar's son(Madurantakan) was one year old. <br />I think only because of that reason the guards went searching for <br />Sundara chozhar in the first place. And during the pattabhishekam <br />Oomai rani tried to kill herself by falling off the light house and <br />then was rescued and found to be pregnant. Now don't you think that <br />is confusing? </p>

<p>  Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>  When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based <br />  on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how <br />  to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />  begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds while <br />  we read this great epic &#150; "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />  any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />  entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />  get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />  secret about her life.</p>
<p>  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />  that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />  woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />  When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she <br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />  listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />  helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />  when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />  powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she <br />  also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />  beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is <br />  certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the <br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the <br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies <br />  who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />  mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />  unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />  that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>  The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman <br />  saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />  emory <br />  and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />  Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>  Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />  Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall <br />  in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>  Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />  Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of <br />  Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />  recognize him?</p>
<p>  The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />  individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />  Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi <br />  Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />  Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back. <br />  Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not <br />  know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />  lighthouse and her last accident. </p>
<p>  Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? <br />  was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles <br />  Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />  assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />  because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />  Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />  been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />  rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind <br />  other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />  traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love <br />  or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />  what happened to her.</p>
<p>  Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to <br />  her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman <br />  finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />  Chola household but before he could get this information to the <br />king <br />  he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that <br />  she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to <br />  their mother.</p>
<p>  Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />  Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the <br />  Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br />  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is <br />  also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 &#150; 22 <br />  years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. <br />  Either way we get the same answer &#150; Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />  daughter.</p>
<p>  The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of <br />  Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />  suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the <br />  Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />  vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />  starts with a preamble that &#150; "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />  imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is <br />  imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>  After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />  Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />  Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />  Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody <br />  to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>  When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />  place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />  house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the <br />  Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at <br />  the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />  Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was <br />  her father? <br />  What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? <br />  I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />  Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have <br />  told her so as well.</p>
<p>  But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />  Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the <br />  presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />  have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />  Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had <br />  realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />  brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />  logic!</p>
<p>  Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him <br />  if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />  needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />  plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />  that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a <br />  mad rage. </p>
<p>  Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She <br />  had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />  wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in <br />  his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>  Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />  meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />  Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />  where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>  Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />  daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan <br />  the way she did. </p>
<p>  Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />  thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />  unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>andamans are located 950km from the mouth of the Hooghly River,</p>
<p>thay are closer geographicaly to myanmar</p>
<p>andaman has islands which are volcanic in nature. I doubt if <br />sedimentary rocks and islands based on them can be volcanic.</p>
<p>A key scene in The Sign of Four, the second book in Conan Doyle's <br />famous Sherlock Holmes series, takes place at the British penal <br />colony in the Andamans; events there have criticial bearing on the <br />solution of the mystery taking place at London some years later and <br />involving an escaped convict from that colony.</p>
<p>The book also introduced an Andaman islander to London, who uses his <br />blowpipe and poisoned darts to deadly effect in the great Victorian <br />capital - adding the exotic touch which Doyle needed in this, as in <br />many others of his works.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Kassapa V. (ninth-tenth century), born of the twice crowned queen' <br />  Sangha, was the son of Sena II., and was made sub-king at his <br />birth. <br />  He was a man of learning, and wrote a Sinhala paraphrase of the <br />  Dhammapada which still survives. In his reign the Pandyan king <br />  Rajasinha unwisely made war on the Cholas, sad being routed asked <br />  for Kassapa's help. The Sinhala king thereupon sent an army, which <br />  returned to Lanka unsuccessful. He died according to the Mahavamsa <br />  in his tenth year His successor, Dappula IV. only ruled for a few <br />  months, and Dappula V. (early tenth century) had hardly come to <br />the <br />  throne when the Pandyan king arrived in Lanka, flying from the <br />  Cholas. The Sinhala monarch was preparing to give him help when a <br />  sudden strife arose among the princes of the Island, and the <br />Pandyan <br />  had to retire to Malabar disappointed, leaving, however, his crown <br />  and royal ornaments with the king of Lanka. The war between the <br />  Pandyans and Cholas seems to have taken place at the end of the <br />  reign of Kassapa V and at the beginning of that of Dappula V.; the <br />  invasion of Rajasinha and the king of Lanka actually is mentioned <br />in <br />  a record of the Chola king Parantaka I. (A.D. 907-953) dated in <br />his <br />  twelfth year, or A.D. 918/9. We see here the rise of the great <br />Chola <br />  Empire, which first overshadowed and finally engulfed the Island <br />  kingdom. </p>
<p>  After Udaya II. and Sena III. the Sinhala throne was occupied by <br />  Udaya III., who was `a drunkard and a sluggard.' Parantaka took <br />  advantage of this, and sent an embassy for the Pandyan regalia <br />left <br />  in Lanka in the time of Dappula V. His demand being refused, he <br />  invaded the Island, Udaya flying with the disputed regalia towards <br />  Ruhuna, which the Chola army did not succeed in entering. The <br />enemy <br />  then `returned to their own country, leaving the Island in great <br />  fear,' and Udaya took reprisals by destroying `the borders of the <br />  dominion of the king of Chola.' Parantaka's power was broken by <br />the <br />  Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. about A.D. 942 /3,. and it seems <br />  likely that this was the cause of the Chola retreat and the <br />counter-<br />  invasion of the Sinhala. Udaya died in his eighth year, while <br />  rebuilding a palace burnt by the Cholas. </p>
<p>  Udaya's second successor was his nephew Mahinda IV. (middle of <br />tenth <br />  century). He departed from former custom by marrying a princess of <br />  the ruling family of Kalinga, which in the twelfth century gave a <br />  dynasty to the Island. Before his ninth year, Lanka was attacked <br />by <br />  King Vallabha, apparently the Chola king Parantaka II., whose <br />  general was slain in Lanka about A.D. 959. The enemy army landed <br />at <br />  Uratota (Kayts). This was the last success of the Sinhala for many <br />a <br />  long year, as Mahinda's son Sena V. foolishly murdered his <br />general's <br />  brother, and the enraged officer took his revenge by assembling <br />  together the Tamils settled in Lanka and making over the country <br />to <br />  them. This took place in the second year of the reign. The Tamils <br />so <br />  oppressed the people that Sena made his peace with the general and <br />  returned to Polonnaruwa. Here, however, becoming addicted to <br />strong <br />  drink, and `like unto a mad tiger,' he died while still young, in <br />  the tenth year of his reign, and was succeeded by his brother <br />  Mahinda V. or Udaya (tenth-eleventh century). </p>
<p>  Fig 3.1Mediaval Gold Coin.  </p>
<p>  The new king reigned at Anuradhapura but governed with difficulty, <br />  as the city was full of foreigners introduced by his late <br />brother's <br />  general. In his twelfth year the revenue was withheld and the king <br />  was unable to pay his Malabar mercenaries, who mutinied. Mahinda <br />  thereupon fled to Ruhuna. leaving the country in the hands of the <br />  Malabars, Sinhala and Canarese. The opportunity was too good to be <br />  lost, and at some date between A.D. 1001/2 and 1004/5 the great <br />  Chola emperor Rajaraja I. (A.D. 985-101.2) conquered all the <br />  country, save the remoter parts which were still held by the <br />  Sinhala. The conquest was completed about A.D. 10 17 by the <br />capture <br />  of Mahinda V. himself with his crown jewels and the Pandyan <br />regalia <br />  left by Rajasinha. Lanka became a province of the Chola empire and <br />  Polonnaruwa was renamed Jananatha pura. It was at this period that <br />  miny of the Hindu shrines in the city were erected. Mahinda V. <br />died <br />  in captivity in India.</p>

<p>  In the early eleventh century, the Chola king Rajendra I furnished <br />  his capital with images he had seized from several prominent <br />  neighbouring kings: Durga and Ganesha images from the Chalukyas; <br />  Bhairava, Bhairavi, and Kali images from the Kalingas of Oris sa; <br />a <br />  Nandi image from the Eastern Chalukyas; and a bronze Siva image <br />from <br />  the Palas of Bengal (see Figure 4). In the mid-eleventh century, <br />the <br />  Chola king Rajadhiraja defeated the Chalukyas and plundered <br />Kalyani, <br />  taking a large black stone door guardian to his capital in <br />  Thanjavur, where it was displayed to his subjects as a trophy of <br />war <br />  (see Figure 5). "</p>
<p>  I am also trying to find the referred article below</p>
<p>  Buddhist literature from Sri Lanka says that the Indian king took <br />  advantage of an internal strife in Sri Lanka and invaded the <br />island. <br />  The ruthless Chola conquest was apparently no different from the <br />  conduct of Mahmud of Ghazni at Somnath. The Kulavamsa says that <br />the <br />  capital Anuradhapura, which sported many Buddhist viharas, <br />  was 'utterly destroyed in every way by the Chola army.' Not only <br />  were the viharas decimated, but the holy stupas in them were torn <br />  apart in search of treasure. As George W. Spencer observes in The <br />  Politics of Expansion: The Chola Conquest of Sri Lanka and Sri <br />  Vijaya, 'Even if we allow for the exaggeration of the chroniclers, <br />  it is clear that the Cholas devastated the city.'

<p>Dear Vj,</p>
<p>For the sake of recollection :</p>
<p>1. Pallava Narasimha I (s/o Mahendra I ) - 630 AD was the first to <br />target Srilanka with avl evidence .. Literary Pandya connections not <br />taken up.</p>
<p>2. First Medvl Chozha to get into Lankan affair was "Mathirayum <br />Eezhamum konda parakesari " - Parantaka I - about 920 AD.</p>
<p>They had reasons .. because, the Tip of the Southern peninsula has <br />always REMAINED Sensitive.. with the Presence of Cheras in <br />Trivandrum (nearby vizhignam fort was famous ... Gokul has mentioned <br />this in his works), Pandyas controlled Kumari and nearby places <br />under the Chozhas - hardly separated by not even 40 miles ! </p>
<p>Lankan alignment with any ONE of Trio or any TWO of Trio has <br />created and Bound to create imbalance in the region.</p>
<p>Pls Recall Rajendra's meykeerthi (as well as Kalki's narrations) .. <br />Pandian Crown and Haram (Indhira mudiyum Sundara haramum) were kept <br />hidden in the Rohana hills much earlier and were unearthed by <br />Rajendra !</p>
<p>Also you will be pleased to find an earlier posting in our Group <br />that topographically, Srilanka is the convenient location to plan <br />and execute any expedition towards Far East from Southern India - <br />Quoting KADALODI Narasayya.!</p>
<p>INCIDETNALLY today TN CM has announced quoting an Expert that the <br />VANDAL (Soil) THITTU (soil hardened over time-immemorial) created <br />between Danushkodi and Lanka is wrongly interpreted as having been <br />built by Raamar which has been a natural creation due to under-water <br />cross-current ..</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>this is the article that i referred to</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1725/17250620.htm" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1725/17250620.htm">http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1725/17250620.htm</a></p>
<p>quote"</p>
<p>In the early eleventh century, the Chola king Rajendra I furnished <br />his capital with images he had seized from several prominent <br />neighbouring kings: Durga and Ganesha images from the Chalukyas; <br />Bhairava, Bhairavi, and Kali images from the Kalingas of Oris sa; a <br />Nandi image from the Eastern Chalukyas; and a bronze Siva image from <br />the Palas of Bengal (see Figure 4). In the mid-eleventh century, the <br />Chola king Rajadhiraja defeated the Chalukyas and plundered Kalyani, <br />taking a large black stone door guardian to his capital in <br />Thanjavur, where it was displayed to his subjects as a trophy of war <br />(see Figure 5). "</p>
<p>I am also trying to find the referred article below</p>
<p>Buddhist literature from Sri Lanka says that the Indian king took <br />advantage of an internal strife in Sri Lanka and invaded the island. <br />The ruthless Chola conquest was apparently no different from the <br />conduct of Mahmud of Ghazni at Somnath. The Kulavamsa says that the <br />capital Anuradhapura, which sported many Buddhist viharas, <br />was 'utterly destroyed in every way by the Chola army.' Not only <br />were the viharas decimated, but the holy stupas in them were torn <br />apart in search of treasure. As George W. Spencer observes in The <br />Politics of Expansion: The Chola Conquest of Sri Lanka and Sri <br />Vijaya, 'Even if we allow for the exaggeration of the chroniclers, <br />it is clear that the Cholas devastated the city.'

        <p>Hi Vj,</p>
<p>There is no denying the fact none of the war is for peaceful purpose. it is<br />a<br />quest for supremacy, money and power and in some cases religious too.<br />If Raja Raja's conquest were true, it is also true that he would have been<br />ruthless<br />in destroying his enemies, occupying their territories and capturing their<br />treasures, that<br />should be the fact I guess.</p>

<p>        Hi,<br />        Here I would like to clarify one point that has been<br />    disturbing<br />      my mind for sometime :</p>
<p>        How old was Senthan Amudhan when Nandini and the old<br />    Madurantakan<br />      were born?</p>
<p>        When Mandakini jumped off the light house, she was pregnant<br />      wasn't she?</p>
<p>        Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by<br />      Karuthirumman and when she was rescued, she was pregnant. Is it<br />      possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That<br />    has<br />      not been mentioned right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani<br />  gave<br />      birth to twins in "Sembiyan Madevi"s palace and that the<br />    replacement<br />      happened after a few days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which<br />      means right after Senthan amudhan was born, the twins were born.<br />    But<br />      it is also said When the Pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar<br />      happened,kandarathitha chozhar's son(Madurantakan) was one year<br />    old.<br />      I think only because of that reason the guards went searching<br />  for<br />      Sundara chozhar in the first place. And during the<br />  pattabhishekam<br />      Oomai rani tried to kill herself by falling off the light house<br />    and<br />      then was rescued and found to be pregnant. Now don't you think<br />    that<br />      is confusing?</p>
<p>        Please correct me if my argument is wrong.</p>

<p>        Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>        When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article<br />    based<br />        on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering<br />    how<br />        to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to<br />        begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds<br />    while<br />        we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>        I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all<br />  by<br />        any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the<br />        entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue<br />  we<br />        get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new<br />        secret about her life.</p>
<p>        Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting<br />  images<br />        that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a<br />  mystery<br />        woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her<br />  history.<br />        When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her<br />  but<br />    she<br />        presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After<br />        listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a<br />        helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man<br />  but<br />        when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to<br />    be<br />        powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and<br />    she<br />        also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>        After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an<br />    exceptionally<br />        beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare<br />    her<br />        beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But<br />  it<br />    is<br />        certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled<br />  in<br />    the<br />        novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around<br />  her<br />        little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love<br />    sick<br />        puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan,<br />  Pallava<br />        Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan<br />  who<br />    is<br />        unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>        The war of will between these two characters is beautiful.<br />        flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya<br />    Devan<br />        escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>        Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us<br />  the<br />        reason immediately because he does not want his audience to<br />  get<br />    the<br />        wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya<br />    spies<br />        who want avenge their king's death.</p>
<p>        Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic<br />        mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an<br />        unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>        Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for<br />    sure<br />        that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it<br />        Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>        I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the<br />  discussion<br />        because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years<br />    after<br />        Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>        The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory.<br />    Karuthiruman<br />        saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her<br />        emory<br />        and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues<br />        Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>        Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes<br />  the<br />        Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan<br />    fall<br />        in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him?</p>
<p>        Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman<br />  confesses<br />    to<br />        Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and<br />    Madhuranthakan.<br />        Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with<br />    Vani,<br />        Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded<br />    of<br />        Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not<br />        recognize him?</p>
<p>        The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two<br />        individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends<br />        Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to<br />    Kodi<br />        Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that<br />        Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is<br />    back.<br />        Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does<br />    not<br />        know what happened to her from the time she fell from the<br />        lighthouse and her last accident.</p>
<p>        Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to<br />    her?<br />        was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini<br />    resembles<br />        Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an<br />    exceptionally<br />        beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If<br />  we<br />        assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly<br />        because I cannot imagine what other business a king like<br />        Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who<br />  has<br />        been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to<br />        rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in<br />    mind<br />        other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he<br />  had<br />        traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special<br />    love<br />        or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find<br />  out<br />        what happened to her.</p>
<p>        Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened<br />    to<br />        her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby?<br />    Karuthiruman<br />        finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up<br />  in<br />        Chola household but before he could get this information to<br />  the<br />      king<br />        he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows<br />    that<br />        she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies<br />  or<br />    to<br />        their mother.</p>
<p>        Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that<br />        Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of<br />    the<br />        Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref:<br />        <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That<br />  is<br />        also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ?<br />  22<br />        years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on<br />  Nandini.<br />        Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's<br />        daughter.</p>
<p>        The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the<br />  father<br />    of<br />        Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to<br />        suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting<br />  for<br />    the<br />        Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to<br />        Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must<br />        vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he<br />        starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some<br />        imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of<br />  it<br />    is<br />        imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>        After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini<br />  to<br />        Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of<br />        Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini<br />    to<br />        Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini<br />    and<br />        Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want<br />    anybody<br />        to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>        When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies<br />  takes<br />        place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to<br />  Nandini's<br />        house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him<br />  from<br />    the<br />        Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get<br />  back<br />    at<br />        the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by<br />        Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that<br />  Veerapandiyan<br />    was<br />        her father?<br />        What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw<br />    Nandini?<br />        I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact<br />    that<br />        Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must<br />    have<br />        told her so as well.</p>
<p>        But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that<br />        Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place<br />  in<br />    the<br />        presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could<br />    she<br />        have declared that if she had known that he is her father?<br />        Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If<br />  she<br />    had<br />        realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call<br />  her<br />        brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply<br />  any<br />        logic!</p>
<p>        Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill<br />    him<br />        if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him<br />  she<br />        needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she<br />  had<br />        plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man<br />    and<br />        that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got<br />    into a<br />        mad rage.</p>
<p>        Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan.<br />    She<br />        had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all<br />  her<br />        wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan<br />    in<br />        his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her<br />  lover.</p>
<p>        Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might<br />    have<br />        meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible.<br />  Even<br />        Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters<br />        where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>        Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's<br />        daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on<br />    Karikalan<br />        the way she did.</p>
<p>        Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody<br />  else<br />        thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try<br />  to<br />        unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

        <p>I have a question to the group - historic accounts seem to conflict <br />with the reglious tolerance shown by arulmozhi during his <br />conquests...Kalki portrays a more heroic /do gooder image of <br />arulmozhi during his time in ceylon, but later day accounts ( post <br />his assession to the throne) he or atleast his armies have been <br />ruthless aka decent amount of plundering. ( even during his <br />conquests against the chalukyas - referrring to an article that <br />appeared earlier in one of hindu's publications -think it was <br />frontline - on religoius plundering in india) where statues were <br />brought back to be displayed as trophies. A large number of temples, <br />monastries were ransacked in search of treasure....could it be that <br />kalki wantedly showed his hero in good light, or did the pressures <br />of mounting such a massive war efforts n temple projects drain their <br />coffers necessiating replinshing the war chests....vj</p>

<p>      Hi,<br />      Here I would like to clarify one point that has been <br />  disturbing <br />    my mind for sometime : </p>
<p>      How old was Senthan Amudhan when Nandini and the old <br />  Madurantakan <br />    were born?</p>
<p>      When Mandakini jumped off the light house, she was pregnant <br />    wasn't she?</p>
<p>      Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by <br />    Karuthirumman and when she was rescued, she was pregnant. Is it <br />    possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That <br />  has <br />    not been mentioned right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani <br />gave <br />    birth to twins in "Sembiyan Madevi"s palace and that the <br />  replacement <br />    happened after a few days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which <br />    means right after Senthan amudhan was born, the twins were born. <br />  But <br />    it is also said When the Pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar <br />    happened,kandarathitha chozhar's son(Madurantakan) was one year <br />  old. <br />    I think only because of that reason the guards went searching <br />for <br />    Sundara chozhar in the first place. And during the <br />pattabhishekam <br />    Oomai rani tried to kill herself by falling off the light house <br />  and <br />    then was rescued and found to be pregnant. Now don't you think <br />  that <br />    is confusing? </p>
<p>      Please correct me if my argument is wrong.</p>

<p>      On 8th July 2002, In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "sv24in" <br />      <sumeetha_pb@  wrote:</p>
<p>      Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>      When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article <br />  based <br />      on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering <br />  how <br />      to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />      begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds <br />  while <br />      we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>      I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all <br />by <br />      any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />      entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue <br />we <br />      get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />      secret about her life.</p>
<p>      Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting <br />images <br />      that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a <br />mystery <br />      woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her <br />history. <br />      When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her <br />but <br />  she <br />      presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />      listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />      helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man <br />but <br />      when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to <br />  be <br />      powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and <br />  she <br />      also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>      After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an <br />  exceptionally <br />      beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare <br />  her <br />      beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But <br />it <br />  is <br />      certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled <br />in <br />  the <br />      novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around <br />her <br />      little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love <br />  sick <br />      puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, <br />Pallava <br />      Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan <br />who <br />  is <br />      unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>      The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />      flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya <br />  Devan <br />      escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>      Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us <br />the <br />      reason immediately because he does not want his audience to <br />get <br />  the <br />      wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya <br />  spies <br />      who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>      Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />      mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />      unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>      Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for <br />  sure <br />      that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />      Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>      I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the <br />discussion <br />      because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years <br />  after <br />      Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>      The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. <br />  Karuthiruman <br />      saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />      emory <br />      and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />      Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>      Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes <br />the <br />      Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan <br />  fall <br />      in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>      Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman <br />confesses <br />  to <br />      Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and <br />  Madhuranthakan. <br />      Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with <br />  Vani, <br />      Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded <br />  of <br />      Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />      recognize him?</p>
<p>      The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />      individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />      Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to <br />  Kodi <br />      Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />      Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is <br />  back. <br />      Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does <br />  not <br />      know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />      lighthouse and her last accident. </p>
<p>      Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to <br />  her? <br />      was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini <br />  resembles <br />      Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an <br />  exceptionally <br />      beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If <br />we <br />      assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />      because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />      Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who <br />has <br />      been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />      rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in <br />  mind <br />      other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he <br />had <br />      traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special <br />  love <br />      or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find <br />out <br />      what happened to her.</p>
<p>      Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened <br />  to <br />      her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? <br />  Karuthiruman <br />      finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up <br />in <br />      Chola household but before he could get this information to <br />the <br />    king <br />      he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows <br />  that <br />      she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies <br />or <br />  to <br />      their mother.</p>
<p>      Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />      Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of <br />  the <br />      Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br />      <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That <br />is <br />      also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? <br />22 <br />      years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on <br />Nandini. <br />      Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />      daughter.</p>
<p>      The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the <br />father <br />  of <br />      Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />      suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting <br />for <br />  the <br />      Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />      Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />      vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />      starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />      imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of <br />it <br />  is <br />      imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>      After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini <br />to <br />      Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />      Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini <br />  to <br />      Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini <br />  and <br />      Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want <br />  anybody <br />      to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>      When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies <br />takes <br />      place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to <br />Nandini's <br />      house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him <br />from <br />  the <br />      Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get <br />back <br />  at <br />      the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />      Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that <br />Veerapandiyan <br />  was <br />      her father? <br />      What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw <br />  Nandini? <br />      I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact <br />  that <br />      Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must <br />  have <br />      told her so as well.</p>
<p>      But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />      Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place <br />in <br />  the <br />      presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could <br />  she <br />      have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />      Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If <br />she <br />  had <br />      realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call <br />her <br />      brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply <br />any <br />      logic!</p>
<p>      Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill <br />  him <br />      if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him <br />she <br />      needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she <br />had <br />      plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man <br />  and <br />      that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got <br />  into a <br />      mad rage. </p>
<p>      Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. <br />  She <br />      had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all <br />her <br />      wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan <br />  in <br />      his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her <br />lover.</p>
<p>      Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might <br />  have <br />      meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. <br />Even <br />      Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />      where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>      Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />      daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on <br />  Karikalan <br />      the way she did. </p>
<p>      Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody <br />else <br />      thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try <br />to <br />      unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<p>    Hi,<br />    Here I would like to clarify one point that has been <br />disturbing <br />  my mind for sometime : </p>
<p>    How old was Senthan Amudhan when Nandini and the old <br />Madurantakan <br />  were born?</p>
<p>    When Mandakini jumped off the light house, she was pregnant <br />  wasn't she?</p>
<p>    Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by <br />  Karuthirumman and when she was rescued, she was pregnant. Is it <br />  possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That <br />has <br />  not been mentioned right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani gave <br />  birth to twins in "Sembiyan Madevi"s palace and that the <br />replacement <br />  happened after a few days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which <br />  means right after Senthan amudhan was born, the twins were born. <br />But <br />  it is also said When the Pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar <br />  happened,kandarathitha chozhar's son(Madurantakan) was one year <br />old. <br />  I think only because of that reason the guards went searching for <br />  Sundara chozhar in the first place. And during the pattabhishekam <br />  Oomai rani tried to kill herself by falling off the light house <br />and <br />  then was rescued and found to be pregnant. Now don't you think <br />that <br />  is confusing? </p>
<p>    Please correct me if my argument is wrong.</p>

<p>    FOR NEW MEMBERS AND EVERY MEMBER .. AGAIN !</p>
<p>    On 8th July 2002, In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "sv24in" <br />    <sumeetha_pb@  wrote:</p>
<p>    Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>    When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article <br />based <br />    on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering <br />how <br />    to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />    begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds <br />while <br />    we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>    I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />    any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />    entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />    get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />    secret about her life.</p>
<p>    Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />    that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />    woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />    When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but <br />she <br />    presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />    listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />    helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />    when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to <br />be <br />    powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and <br />she <br />    also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>    After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an <br />exceptionally <br />    beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare <br />her <br />    beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it <br />is <br />    certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in <br />the <br />    novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />    little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love <br />sick <br />    puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />    Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who <br />is <br />    unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>    The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />    flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya <br />Devan <br />    escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>    Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />    reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get <br />the <br />    wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya <br />spies <br />    who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>    Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />    mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />    unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>    Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for <br />sure <br />    that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />    Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>    I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />    because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years <br />after <br />    Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>    The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. <br />Karuthiruman <br />    saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />    emory <br />    and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />    Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>    Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />    Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan <br />fall <br />    in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>    Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses <br />to <br />    Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and <br />Madhuranthakan. <br />    Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with <br />Vani, <br />    Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded <br />of <br />    Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />    recognize him?</p>
<p>    The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />    individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />    Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to <br />Kodi <br />    Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />    Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is <br />back. <br />    Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does <br />not <br />    know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />    lighthouse and her last accident. </p>
<p>    Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to <br />her? <br />    was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini <br />resembles <br />    Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an <br />exceptionally <br />    beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />    assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />    because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />    Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />    been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />    rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in <br />mind <br />    other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />    traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special <br />love <br />    or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />    what happened to her.</p>
<p>    Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened <br />to <br />    her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? <br />Karuthiruman <br />    finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />    Chola household but before he could get this information to the <br />  king <br />    he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows <br />that <br />    she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or <br />to <br />    their mother.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>-Hi</p>
<p>just remind yourself of this scene.</p>
<p>thiru koviloor malayaman talks to aditya karikalan just before he <br />goes for the last time to kadambur.</p>
<p>he tells him on the birth of aditya karikalan the festivities lasted <br />for days at a stretch and the wealth of the malayamans of three <br />generations was spent. he goes on to give a list of who all attended <br />the function.<br />it includes predecessors of sundara sola.</p>
<p>but then sundara was rescued from the island only after all his <br />predescessors had died and their was no heir to the chola throne.</p>
<p>and then he married and beget aditya.</p>
<p>kalki did slip in many places but unfortunately since he wrote weekly <br />he could not go back and correct himself.</p>
<p>another classic case is murugaiyan ( brother of pungkuzhali)who is <br />introduced as physically challenged and dumb in the start but speaks <br />volumes later.</p>

<p>possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That has <br />not been mentioned right?

Now don't you think that <br />is confusing? </p>

<p>  FOR NEW MEMBERS AND EVERY MEMBER .. AGAIN !</p>
<p>  On 8th July 2002, In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "sv24in" <br />  <sumeetha_pb@  wrote:</p>
<p>  Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>  When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based <br />  on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how <br />  to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />  begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds while <br />  we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />  any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />  entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />  get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />  secret about her life.</p>
<p>  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />  that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />  woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />  When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she <br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />  listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />  helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />  when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />  powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she <br />  also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />  beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is <br />  certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the <br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the <br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies <br />  who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />  mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />  unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />  that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>  The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman <br />  saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />  emory <br />  and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />  Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>  Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />  Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall <br />  in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>  Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />  Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of <br />  Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />  recognize him?</p>
<p>  The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />  individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />  Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi <br />  Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />  Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back. <br />  Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not <br />  know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />  lighthouse and her last accident. </p>
<p>  Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? <br />  was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles <br />  Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />  assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />  because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />  Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />  been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />  rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind <br />  other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />  traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love <br />  or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />  what happened to her.</p>
<p>  Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to <br />  her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman <br />  finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />  Chola household but before he could get this information to the <br />king <br />  he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that <br />  she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to <br />  their mother.</p>
<p>  Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />  Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the <br />  Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br />  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is <br />  also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22 <br />  years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. <br />  Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />  daughter.</p>
<p>  The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of <br />  Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />  suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the <br />  Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />  vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />  starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />  imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is <br />  imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>  After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />  Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />  Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />  Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody <br />  to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>  When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />  place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />  house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the <br />  Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at <br />  the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />  Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was <br />  her father? <br />  What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? <br />  I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />  Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have <br />  told her so as well.</p>
<p>  But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />  Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the <br />  presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />  have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />  Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had <br />  realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />  brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />  logic!</p>
<p>  Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him <br />  if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />  needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />  plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />  that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a <br />  mad rage. </p>
<p>  Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She <br />  had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />  wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in <br />  his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>  Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />  meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />  Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />  where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>  Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />  daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan <br />  the way she did. </p>
<p>  Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />  thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />  unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

Now which part of it is <br />imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody <br />to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the <br />Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at <br />the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was <br />her father? <br />What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? <br />I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have <br />told her so as well.</p>
<p>But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the <br />presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had <br />realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />logic!</p>
<p>Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him <br />if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a <br />mad rage. </p>
<p>Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She <br />had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in <br />his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan <br />the way she did. </p>
<p>Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<p>  Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>  When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based<br />  on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how<br />  to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to<br />  begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds while<br />  we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by<br />  any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the<br />  entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we<br />  get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new<br />  secret about her life.</p>
<p>  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images<br />  that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery<br />  woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history.<br />  When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she<br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After<br />  listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a<br />  helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but<br />  when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be<br />  powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she<br />  also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally<br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her<br />  beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is<br />  certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the<br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her<br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick<br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava<br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is<br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful.<br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan<br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the<br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the<br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies<br />  who want avenge their king's death.</p>
<p>  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic<br />  mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an<br />  unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure<br />  that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it<br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion<br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after<br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>  The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman<br />  saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her<br />  emory<br />  and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues<br />  Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>  Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the<br />  Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall<br />  in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him?</p>
<p>  Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan.<br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani,<br />  Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of<br />  Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not<br />  recognize him?</p>
<p>  The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two<br />  individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends<br />  Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi<br />  Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that<br />  Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back.<br />  Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not<br />  know what happened to her from the time she fell from the<br />  lighthouse and her last accident.</p>
<p>  Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her?<br />  was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles<br />  Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally<br />  beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we<br />  assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly<br />  because I cannot imagine what other business a king like<br />  Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has<br />  been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to<br />  rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind<br />  other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had<br />  traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love<br />  or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out<br />  what happened to her.</p>
<p>  Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to<br />  her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman<br />  finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in<br />  Chola household but before he could get this information to the king<br />  he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that<br />  she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to<br />  their mother.</p>
<p>  Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that<br />  Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the<br />  Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref:<br />  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is<br />  also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22<br />  years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini.<br />  Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's<br />  daughter.</p>
<p>  The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of<br />  Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to<br />  suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the<br />  Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must<br />  vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he<br />  starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some<br />  imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is<br />  imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>  After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of<br />  Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to<br />  Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and<br />  Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody<br />  to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>  When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes<br />  place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's<br />  house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the<br />  Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at<br />  the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by<br />  Kundavai?

And he must have<br />  told her so as well.</p>
<p>  But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that<br />  Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the<br />  presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she<br />  have declared that if she had known that he is her father?<br />  Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had<br />  realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her<br />  brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any<br />  logic!</p>
<p>  Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him<br />  if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she<br />  needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had<br />  plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and<br />  that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a<br />  mad rage.</p>
<p>  Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She<br />  had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her<br />  wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in<br />  his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>  Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have<br />  meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even<br />  Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters<br />  where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>  Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's<br />  daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan<br />  the way she did.</p>
<p>  Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else<br />  thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to<br />  unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>
