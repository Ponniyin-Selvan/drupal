<p>listed in the Rajaraja Chola's Meikeerththi</p>
<p>The Chola king Arumolidevan (also known as Arumolivarman) son of Sundera<br />Cholan and (periya)Vaanavan Mahaadevi ascended the Chola throne in the<br />year A.D.985 with the crown title - the Rajakesari, after 17 years of<br />rule of Uththama Cholan.</p>
<p>Note: Sundera Cholan's Queen "Vaanavan Mahaadevi" has been<br />differentiated in the inscriptions from "Vaanavan Mahaadevi alias<br />Thiribhuvanamaadevi" the Queen of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, by a<br />prefix "periya" meaning senior among them.</p>
<p>In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate - "years of<br />conquests" of countries by Rajaraja Chola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />first made a schedule of inscriptions of Rajaraja sequenced by their<br />respective years, for our study as follows:</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>570 of 1904 from Thiruvaarur<br />- 2nd year</p>
<p>Mention of title Rajakesari - No conquests</p>
<p>In the third year Rajakesari went on a war expedition to Kandalursaalai.</p>
<p>On his way he had to meet the opposition of the Pandiyan king</p>
<p>Amarabujangan whom he defeated and took away their splendour.</p>
<p>He then captured the Kaandalursaalai of the Cheras. With his rule over</p>
<p>three kingdoms namely the Chola, Pandiya and Chera, he assumed</p>
<p>the title the Mummudi Choladevar, and also given an enhanced crown title<br />as</p>
<p>Rajarajakesari from his original as Rajakesari. This crown title appears<br />to</p>
<p>have been shortened to Rajaraja in the same year, and he was known as</p>
<p>Rajaraja and Rajarajadevar (the Rajaraja Chola), as seen from</p>
<p>his 3rd year inscriptions listed below.</p>
<p>147 of 1918 from Thiruvaiyaru<br />- 3rd year</p>

<p>--------------</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>at the following conclusions in our study of the "years of his<br />conquest" of other countries mentioned in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>Note: Criteria followed in dating the year of each expedition somewhat<br />accurately, was by deducting one year, from the year each country has<br />been included in the Meikeerththi of Rajaraja Chola - 1, as the practice<br />was only after an expedition is fully complete with the forces having<br />returned to the Chola country, the name of the country was included in<br />same.</p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola - 1 commenced his war expeditions with his capture of<br />Pandiya Nadu, in in south Tamil Nadu, Kandalursaalai and Vilignam in<br />south Kerala, in the year A.D.987 (985 + [3-1]).</p>
<p>In the year A.D.990 (985 + [6-1]) he captured the regions of<br />Seetpulinaadu and Paakinaadu in south Andhra Pradesh,</p>
<p>After a lapse of eight years he turned his attention to Vengi Mandalam<br />in north Andhra Pradesh, and after its capture proceeded to the regions<br />Gangapaadi, Nulambapaadi and Thadigaipaadi the south, and central<br />regions of Karanataka, which were all captured in one single expedition<br />in the year A.D.998 (985 + [14-1]). It appears in this same expedition<br />king Rajaraja Chola captured also the Tuluva Nadu in the east Karnataka<br />adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>Then he turned his attention to Kudamalainaadu in west Kerala, and sent<br />an expedition in his A.D.999 (985 + [15-1]). It appears it was in this<br />same expedition he won over the Udagai in the west Tamilnadu bordering<br />Kerala.</p>
<p>In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />part of this same year a separate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />Orissa which too was captured. It appears it was in this same expedition<br />he captured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of West<br />Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered region<br />of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>In the year A.D.1001 (985 + [17-1] he sent his forces which crossed the<br />seas and captured the northern half of Elamandalam the Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>In the year A.D.1006 (985 + [22-1] he sent an expedition which captured<br />Irrattaipaadi Elaraiillakkam encompassing the north Karnataka and south<br />Maharashtra, and the Sourashtra of north Maharashtra. It appears in this<br />same expedition Rajaraja Chola captured also the Konkana in the east<br />Maharashtra adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>Thereafter for a period of seven years Rajaraja Chola didnot continue<br />with further expeditions.</p>
<p>However in the year A.D.1013 (985 + [29-1]) his forces again crossed the<br />seas and captured the Munneer Palanthivu Panneeraayiram the Maldives &amp; Lakshadweep islands.</p>
<p>The End</p>

          A Historical Study - on the years of conquests of countries list        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Mr S.Gokul,</p>
<p>My very humble submissions to your query.</p>
<p>You have mentioned "Udagai is Mahodagai". What you have referred - is<br />it "Mahodagai" or "Mahothai" the Chera capital. Kindly advice.</p>
<p>If it is Mahothai, then Mahothai &amp; Uthahai(Udagai)are two different<br />regions. Mahothai which was the original Vanji Nagar later renamed as<br />Kodungallur, and then again renamed as Mahothai. After the period of<br />100 years war by Cholas with the Chera country, it was again popularly<br />known as Kodungallur.</p>
<p>If what you have mentioned is "Mahodagai" then I need to make further<br />study on same, as this name is new to me.</p>
<p>Regarding the other points raised by you, I will revert to you soon.<br />I also wish to thank you, on your complementary remark on my Thread.</p>
<p>With much regards to you.</p>
<p>Virarajendra</p>

<p>  As usual, you have painstakingly summarized a complicated chronology<br />  of wars of Rajaraja-I. Excellent work</p>
<p>  Few thoughts :<br />  - Rajaraja was almost certainly his abhiseka nama with which he<br />  assumed throne. Not something that came out of other titles. It is not<br />  customary to use other titles as one's name.</p>
<p>  - Till his 15th year his meikeerthi was not formatted. Hence he was<br />  mentioned only as "Kanthaloor chalai kalamarutha ko rajakesarivarman".<br />  This was not a part of meikeerthi but just a title he assumed. His<br />  meykeerthi should be considered only with appearance of "Thirumagal<br />pola".</p>
<p>  - Udagai conquest should not be taken as "Kongu" conquest. Both are<br />  different countries. Udagai is Mahodagai and not Udagamandalam as<br />  earlier thought. His Udagai conquest - considered as a pinnacle by<br />  Ottakoothar and Jayamkondar - does not appear in his meykeerthi at all.</p>
<p>  - In order to place nolambapadi and gangapadi wars it is better to<br />  considered Ganga and Nolamba inscriptions also.</p>

His<br />  meykeerthi should be considered only with appearance <br />of "Thirumagal pola".</p>
<p>  - Udagai conquest should not be taken as "Kongu" conquest. Both are<br />  different countries. Udagai is Mahodagai and not Udagamandalam as<br />  earlier thought. His Udagai conquest - considered as a pinnacle by<br />  Ottakoothar and Jayamkondar - does not appear in his meykeerthi at <br />all.</p>
<p>  - In order to place nolambapadi and gangapadi wars it is better to<br />  considered Ganga and Nolamba inscriptions also.</p>

        <p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>As usual, you have painstakingly summarized a complicated chronology<br />of wars of Rajaraja-I. Excellent work</p>
<p>Few thoughts :<br />- Rajaraja was almost certainly his abhiseka nama with which he<br />assumed throne. Not something that came out of other titles. It is not<br />customary to use other titles as one's name.</p>
<p>- Till his 15th year his meikeerthi was not formatted. Hence he was<br />mentioned only as "Kanthaloor chalai kalamarutha ko rajakesarivarman".<br />This was not a part of meikeerthi but just a title he assumed. His<br />meykeerthi should be considered only with appearance of "Thirumagal pola".</p>
<p>- Udagai conquest should not be taken as "Kongu" conquest. Both are<br />different countries. Udagai is Mahodagai and not Udagamandalam as<br />earlier thought. His Udagai conquest - considered as a pinnacle by<br />Ottakoothar and Jayamkondar - does not appear in his meykeerthi at all.</p>
<p>- In order to place nolambapadi and gangapadi wars it is better to<br />considered Ganga and Nolamba inscriptions also.</p>

<p>  A Historical Study - on the years of conquests of countries</p>
<p>  listed in the Rajaraja Chola's Meikeerththi</p>
<p>  The Chola king Arumolidevan (also known as Arumolivarman) son of Sundera<br />  Cholan and (periya)Vaanavan Mahaadevi ascended the Chola throne in the<br />  year A.D.985 with the crown title - the Rajakesari, after 17 years of<br />  rule of Uththama Cholan.</p>
<p>  Note: Sundera Cholan's Queen "Vaanavan Mahaadevi" has been<br />  differentiated in the inscriptions from "Vaanavan Mahaadevi alias<br />  Thiribhuvanamaadevi" the Queen of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, by a<br />  prefix "periya" meaning senior among them.</p>
<p>  In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate - "years of<br />  conquests" of countries by Rajaraja Chola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />  first made a schedule of inscriptions of Rajaraja sequenced by their<br />  respective years, for our study as follows:</p>
<p>  --------------</p>
<p>  570 of 1904 from Thiruvaarur<br />  - 2nd year</p>
<p>  Mention of title Rajakesari - No conquests</p>
<p>  In the third year Rajakesari went on a war expedition to Kandalursaalai.</p>
<p>  On his way he had to meet the opposition of the Pandiyan king</p>
<p>  Amarabujangan whom he defeated and took away their splendour.</p>
<p>  He then captured the Kaandalursaalai of the Cheras. With his rule over</p>
<p>  three kingdoms namely the Chola, Pandiya and Chera, he assumed</p>
<p>  the title the Mummudi Choladevar, and also given an enhanced crown title<br />  as</p>
<p>  Rajarajakesari from his original as Rajakesari. This crown title appears<br />  to</p>
<p>  have been shortened to Rajaraja in the same year, and he was known as</p>
<p>  Rajaraja and Rajarajadevar (the Rajaraja Chola), as seen from</p>
<p>  his 3rd year inscriptions listed below.</p>
<p>  147 of 1918 from Thiruvaiyaru<br />  - 3rd year</p>

<p>  --------------</p>
<p>  Summary</p>
<p>  at the following conclusions in our study of the "years of his<br />  conquest" of other countries mentioned in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>  Note: Criteria followed in dating the year of each expedition somewhat<br />  accurately, was by deducting one year, from the year each country has<br />  been included in the Meikeerththi of Rajaraja Chola - 1, as the practice<br />  was only after an expedition is fully complete with the forces having<br />  returned to the Chola country, the name of the country was included in<br />  same.</p>
<p>  -------------</p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola - 1 commenced his war expeditions with his capture of<br />  Pandiya Nadu, in in south Tamil Nadu, Kandalursaalai and Vilignam in<br />  south Kerala, in the year A.D.987 (985 + [3-1]).</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.990 (985 + [6-1]) he captured the regions of<br />  Seetpulinaadu and Paakinaadu in south Andhra Pradesh,</p>
<p>  After a lapse of eight years he turned his attention to Vengi Mandalam<br />  in north Andhra Pradesh, and after its capture proceeded to the regions<br />  Gangapaadi, Nulambapaadi and Thadigaipaadi the south, and central<br />  regions of Karanataka, which were all captured in one single expedition<br />  in the year A.D.998 (985 + [14-1]). It appears in this same expedition<br />  king Rajaraja Chola captured also the Tuluva Nadu in the east Karnataka<br />  adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>  Then he turned his attention to Kudamalainaadu in west Kerala, and sent<br />  an expedition in his A.D.999 (985 + [15-1]). It appears it was in this<br />  same expedition he won over the Udagai in the west Tamilnadu bordering<br />  Kerala.</p>
<p>  In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />  sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />  part of this same year a separate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />  Orissa which too was captured. It appears it was in this same expedition<br />  he captured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of West<br />  Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered region<br />  of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1001 (985 + [17-1] he sent his forces which crossed the<br />  seas and captured the northern half of Elamandalam the Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1006 (985 + [22-1] he sent an expedition which captured<br />  Irrattaipaadi Elaraiillakkam encompassing the north Karnataka and south<br />  Maharashtra, and the Sourashtra of north Maharashtra. It appears in this<br />  same expedition Rajaraja Chola captured also the Konkana in the east<br />  Maharashtra adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>  Thereafter for a period of seven years Rajaraja Chola didnot continue<br />  with further expeditions.</p>
<p>  However in the year A.D.1013 (985 + [29-1]) his forces again crossed the<br />  seas and captured the Munneer Palanthivu Panneeraayiram the Maldives &amp;   Lakshadweep islands.</p>
<p>  The End</p></blockquote>
<p>I found this ABSOLUTELY enthralling <br />THANK YOU</p>

<p>  A Historical Study - on the years of conquests of countries</p>
<p>  listed in the Rajaraja Chola's Meikeerththi</p>
<p>  The Chola king Arumolidevan (also known as Arumolivarman) son of <br />Sundera<br />  Cholan and (periya)Vaanavan Mahaadevi ascended the Chola throne in <br />the<br />  year A.D.985 with the crown title - the Rajakesari, after 17 years <br />of<br />  rule of Uththama Cholan.</p>
<p>  Note: Sundera Cholan's Queen "Vaanavan Mahaadevi" has been<br />  differentiated in the inscriptions from "Vaanavan Mahaadevi alias<br />  Thiribhuvanamaadevi" the Queen of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, by a<br />  prefix "periya" meaning senior among them.</p>
<p>  In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate - "years of<br />  conquests" of countries by Rajaraja Chola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />  first made a schedule of inscriptions of Rajaraja sequenced by their<br />  respective years, for our study as follows:</p>
<p>  --------------</p>
<p>  570 of 1904 from Thiruvaarur<br />  - 2nd year</p>
<p>  Mention of title Rajakesari - No conquests</p>
<p>  In the third year Rajakesari went on a war expedition to <br />Kandalursaalai.</p>
<p>  On his way he had to meet the opposition of the Pandiyan king</p>
<p>  Amarabujangan whom he defeated and took away their splendour.</p>
<p>  He then captured the Kaandalursaalai of the Cheras. With his rule <br />over</p>
<p>  three kingdoms namely the Chola, Pandiya and Chera, he assumed</p>
<p>  the title the Mummudi Choladevar, and also given an enhanced crown <br />title<br />  as</p>
<p>  Rajarajakesari from his original as Rajakesari. This crown title <br />appears<br />  to</p>
<p>  have been shortened to Rajaraja in the same year, and he was known <br />as</p>

<p>  --------------</p>
<p>  Summary</p>
<p>arrive<br />  at the following conclusions in our study of the "years of his<br />  conquest" of other countries mentioned in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>  Note: Criteria followed in dating the year of each expedition <br />somewhat<br />  accurately, was by deducting one year, from the year each country <br />has<br />  been included in the Meikeerththi of Rajaraja Chola - 1, as the <br />practice<br />  was only after an expedition is fully complete with the forces <br />having<br />  returned to the Chola country, the name of the country was included <br />in<br />  same.</p>
<p>  -------------</p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola - 1 commenced his war expeditions with his capture of<br />  Pandiya Nadu, in in south Tamil Nadu, Kandalursaalai and Vilignam in<br />  south Kerala, in the year A.D.987 (985 + [3-1]).</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.990 (985 + [6-1]) he captured the regions of<br />  Seetpulinaadu and Paakinaadu in south Andhra Pradesh,</p>
<p>  After a lapse of eight years he turned his attention to Vengi <br />Mandalam<br />  in north Andhra Pradesh, and after its capture proceeded to the <br />regions<br />  Gangapaadi, Nulambapaadi and Thadigaipaadi the south, and central<br />  regions of Karanataka, which were all captured in one single <br />expedition<br />  in the year A.D.998 (985 + [14-1]). It appears in this same <br />expedition<br />  king Rajaraja Chola captured also the Tuluva Nadu in the east <br />Karnataka<br />  adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>  Then he turned his attention to Kudamalainaadu in west Kerala, and <br />sent<br />  an expedition in his A.D.999 (985 + [15-1]). It appears it was in <br />this<br />  same expedition he won over the Udagai in the west Tamilnadu <br />bordering<br />  Kerala.</p>
<p>  In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />  sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />  part of this same year a separate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />  Orissa which too was captured. It appears it was in this same <br />expedition<br />  he captured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of <br />West<br />  Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered <br />region<br />  of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1001 (985 + [17-1] he sent his forces which crossed <br />the<br />  seas and captured the northern half of Elamandalam the Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1006 (985 + [22-1] he sent an expedition which <br />captured<br />  Irrattaipaadi Elaraiillakkam encompassing the north Karnataka and <br />south<br />  Maharashtra, and the Sourashtra of north Maharashtra. It appears in <br />this<br />  same expedition Rajaraja Chola captured also the Konkana in the east<br />  Maharashtra adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>  Thereafter for a period of seven years Rajaraja Chola didnot <br />continue<br />  with further expeditions.</p>
<p>  However in the year A.D.1013 (985 + [29-1]) his forces again <br />crossed the<br />  seas and captured the Munneer Palanthivu Panneeraayiram the <br />Maldives &amp;   Lakshadweep islands.</p>

<p>After writing on Kerala Mercinaries, while I was driving back home, <br />I was pondering the subject again and again.<br />Suddenly I recalled: KERALANTHAGAN VOIL in Periyakoil... No <br />Madurantagan voil...  <br />Of all the names, why did he chose this <br />particular name.. He is obsessed with Kerala war.. Identifying these <br />mercinaries has only made him the King - the process by which he <br />could over-power Uthama and sit in throne - as an Emperor! </p>
<p>Incidentally do you know that Pandarathar hailed from <br />Thirupperumbuyam? </p>
<p>Ironically the Mahadevar is SATSHINADHAR - though famous for <br />Vennimaram - Kinaru - Chettippenn episode of Thiruvalayadal <br />puranam. <br />Even today you can find a Vannimaram - Chettippen - Kinaru engraving <br />in one of the pillars near old Sundareswara (protected during <br />Malikafur period) in Madurai. Thiruppurambuyam - Madurai <br />connections are un-ending! UTHAMA was also known as VIKRAMA CHOZHAN:</p>

<p>  --------------</p>
<p>  Summary</p>
<p>arrive<br />  at the following conclusions in our study of the "years of his<br />  conquest" of other countries mentioned in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>  Note: Criteria followed in dating the year of each expedition <br />somewhat<br />  accurately, was by deducting one year, from the year each country <br />has<br />  been included in the Meikeerththi of Rajaraja Chola - 1, as the <br />practice<br />  was only after an expedition is fully complete with the forces <br />having<br />  returned to the Chola country, the name of the country was included <br />in<br />  same.</p>
<p>  -------------</p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola - 1 commenced his war expeditions with his capture of<br />  Pandiya Nadu, in in south Tamil Nadu, Kandalursaalai and Vilignam in<br />  south Kerala, in the year A.D.987 (985 + [3-1]).</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.990 (985 + [6-1]) he captured the regions of<br />  Seetpulinaadu and Paakinaadu in south Andhra Pradesh,</p>
<p>  After a lapse of eight years he turned his attention to Vengi <br />Mandalam<br />  in north Andhra Pradesh, and after its capture proceeded to the <br />regions<br />  Gangapaadi, Nulambapaadi and Thadigaipaadi the south, and central<br />  regions of Karanataka, which were all captured in one single <br />expedition<br />  in the year A.D.998 (985 + [14-1]). It appears in this same <br />expedition<br />  king Rajaraja Chola captured also the Tuluva Nadu in the east <br />Karnataka<br />  adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>  Then he turned his attention to Kudamalainaadu in west Kerala, and <br />sent<br />  an expedition in his A.D.999 (985 + [15-1]). It appears it was in <br />this<br />  same expedition he won over the Udagai in the west Tamilnadu <br />bordering<br />  Kerala.</p>
<p>  In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />  sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />  part of this same year a separate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />  Orissa which too was captured. It appears it was in this same <br />expedition<br />  he captured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of <br />West<br />  Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered <br />region<br />  of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1001 (985 + [17-1] he sent his forces which crossed <br />the<br />  seas and captured the northern half of Elamandalam the Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1006 (985 + [22-1] he sent an expedition which <br />captured<br />  Irrattaipaadi Elaraiillakkam encompassing the north Karnataka and <br />south<br />  Maharashtra, and the Sourashtra of north Maharashtra. It appears in <br />this<br />  same expedition Rajaraja Chola captured also the Konkana in the east<br />  Maharashtra adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>  Thereafter for a period of seven years Rajaraja Chola didnot <br />continue<br />  with further expeditions.</p>
<p>  However in the year A.D.1013 (985 + [29-1]) his forces again <br />crossed the<br />  seas and captured the Munneer Palanthivu Panneeraayiram the <br />Maldives &amp;   Lakshadweep islands.</p>

<p>  A Historical Study - on the years of conquests of countries</p>
<p>  listed in the Rajaraja Chola's Meikeerththi</p>
<p>  The Chola king Arumolidevan (also known as Arumolivarman) son of Sundera<br />  Cholan and (periya)Vaanavan Mahaadevi ascended the Chola throne in the<br />  year A.D.985 with the crown title - the Rajakesari, after 17 years of<br />  rule of Uththama Cholan.</p>
<p>  Note: Sundera Cholan's Queen "Vaanavan Mahaadevi" has been<br />  differentiated in the inscriptions from "Vaanavan Mahaadevi alias<br />  Thiribhuvanamaadevi" the Queen of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, by a<br />  prefix "periya" meaning senior among them.</p>
<p>  In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate - "years of<br />  conquests" of countries by Rajaraja Chola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />  first made a schedule of inscriptions of Rajaraja sequenced by their<br />  respective years, for our study as follows:</p>
<p>  --------------</p>
<p>  570 of 1904 from Thiruvaarur<br />  - 2nd year</p>
<p>  Mention of title Rajakesari - No conquests</p>
<p>  In the third year Rajakesari went on a war expedition to Kandalursaalai.</p>
<p>  On his way he had to meet the opposition of the Pandiyan king</p>
<p>  Amarabujangan whom he defeated and took away their splendour.</p>
<p>  He then captured the Kaandalursaalai of the Cheras. With his rule over</p>
<p>  three kingdoms namely the Chola, Pandiya and Chera, he assumed</p>
<p>  the title the Mummudi Choladevar, and also given an enhanced crown title<br />  as</p>
<p>  Rajarajakesari from his original as Rajakesari. This crown title appears<br />  to</p>
<p>  have been shortened to Rajaraja in the same year, and he was known as</p>
<p>  Rajaraja and Rajarajadevar (the Rajaraja Chola), as seen from</p>
<p>  his 3rd year inscriptions listed below.</p>
<p>  147 of 1918 from Thiruvaiyaru<br />  - 3rd year</p>

<p>  After a lapse of eight years he turned his attention to Vengi Mandalam<br />  in north Andhra Pradesh, and after its capture proceeded to the regions<br />  Gangapaadi, Nulambapaadi and Thadigaipaadi the south, and central<br />  regions of Karanataka, which were all captured in one single expedition<br />  in the year A.D.998 (985 + [14-1]). It appears in this same expedition<br />  king Rajaraja Chola captured also the Tuluva Nadu in the east Karnataka<br />  adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>  Then he turned his attention to Kudamalainaadu in west Kerala, and sent<br />  an expedition in his A.D.999 (985 + [15-1]). It appears it was in this<br />  same expedition he won over the Udagai in the west Tamilnadu bordering<br />  Kerala.</p>
<p>  In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />  sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />  part of this same year a separate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />  Orissa which too was captured. It appears it was in this same expedition<br />  he captured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of West<br />  Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered region<br />  of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1001 (985 + [17-1] he sent his forces which crossed the<br />  seas and captured the northern half of Elamandalam the Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1006 (985 + [22-1] he sent an expedition which captured<br />  Irrattaipaadi Elaraiillakkam encompassing the north Karnataka and south<br />  Maharashtra, and the Sourashtra of north Maharashtra. It appears in this<br />  same expedition Rajaraja Chola captured also the Konkana in the east<br />  Maharashtra adjacent to the arabian sea.</p>
<p>  Thereafter for a period of seven years Rajaraja Chola didnot continue<br />  with further expeditions.</p>
<p>  However in the year A.D.1013 (985 + [29-1]) his forces again crossed the<br />  seas and captured the Munneer Palanthivu Panneeraayiram the Maldives &amp;   Lakshadweep islands.</p>
<p>  The End</p>
