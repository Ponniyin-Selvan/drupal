</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Sampath</p>
<p>That was a very nice opening series of mail...I havent read Kamba ramayanam so cannot agree or disagree but if you are comparing Kalki to Kambar ever Kalki will agree its a great honour....</p>
<p>But is that a justified comparision....My reasons for rating kalki above Kambar....</p>
<p>Kalki's charectors were all his creations....Kambars charectors were created by Valmiki...the story line was set the suspense was over....</p>
<p>its like SJ Surya saying in Kushi Ivan than hero iva than heroine ivanga seraporanga eppadi sera porangangrathu than kathai....</p>
<p>But for kalki his base was RRs ascension to throne or Mammalar's Vathapi vadam and created a whole story line plots and subplots......</p>
<p>I think we have to give credit to originality as opposed to remake....thats exactly what it is isnt it a story line improved and improvised by the creator....</p>
<p>Next is the timeline.....Kambar wrote his excellent treatise in a contemporary literary language....</p>
<p>Kalki wrote a historical novel in a different stance and language to contemporary parlance and still reached hundreds of thousand people...</p>
<p>If Kalki had lived in Kulothunga's era...we ll probably be saying Kalki veetu Kadavum Kadhai Sollum</p>
<p>Its not any disrespect to the greatest tamil literary work of Kambar but my personal veiw point</p>
<p>Regards</p>

        <p>Dear Sampath,</p>
<p>Looking forward to reading your comparisons. As I mentioned earlier,<br />with my complete ignorance of Kamban, this will be a good learning<br />opportunity for me.</p>

<p>    Agreed. We then just all have to agree on the variables to be<br />    compared. If the general consensus is to NOT compare them based on<br />    poetry/language, then I have no complaints. : - )</p>

<p>      Arun krishnan,</p>
<p>      Its not possible to compare all elements of two works.And<br />  difference<br />      also exists about perception of the key comparision variable.The<br />      variables used to compare differ from individual to<br />  individual.The<br />      variables selected are based on the purpose of comparision and<br />      skills of the critic.</p>
<p>      If an economist compares kalki and kamban he will choose the<br />      variables of contribution to GDP,creation of publishing jobs,and<br />      consumption of paper.If a publisher compares both works he will<br />      compare them using only one variable."How much can I earn?".If a<br />      reader compares both he will use the variables of price,its<br />      inclusion in his BA tamil syllabus and whether it will help him<br />  to<br />      impress his neighbour girl or not.A old books seller will only<br />  use<br />      the variable of weight.A critic of poetry will use variables of<br />      varnanai and uvamai.A critic specalizing in novels will compare<br />      suspense and plots.A social reformer will compare kundavai's<br />      diplomatic skills with seetha's jumping in fire and will say<br />  kalki<br />      scores better in feminism than kamban.</p>
<p>      So its not possible to compare two works on every aspect.Its also<br />      difficult to agree upon a key comparable variable.If you hold<br />  that<br />      feminism is the key important parameter,then how can I refuse<br />  that?I<br />      cannot.I can only say "In these parameters he is better.My<br />  knowledge<br />      is limited only in these areas.If somebody can come with some<br />  other<br />      variable,I am happy to learn it"</p>

        <p>we cannot compare these works based on poetry.But we can compare on <br />language.We can compare kalki's varnanai of srilanka with kambar's <br />varnanai of mithila.We can see what words kalki has used to describe <br />vanathi and what words kamban has used to describe seetha.We can <br />compare who has portrayed his dream heroine better,his dream love <br />better etc.Possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>    Its not possible to compare all elements of two works.And <br />difference<br />    also exists about perception of the key comparision variable.The<br />    variables used to compare differ from individual to <br />individual.The<br />    variables selected are based on the purpose of comparision and<br />    skills of the critic.</p>
<p>    If an economist compares kalki and kamban he will choose the<br />    variables of contribution to GDP,creation of publishing jobs,and<br />    consumption of paper.If a publisher compares both works he will<br />    compare them using only one variable."How much can I earn?".If a<br />    reader compares both he will use the variables of price,its<br />    inclusion in his BA tamil syllabus and whether it will help him <br />to<br />    impress his neighbour girl or not.A old books seller will only <br />use<br />    the variable of weight.A critic of poetry will use variables of<br />    varnanai and uvamai.A critic specalizing in novels will compare<br />    suspense and plots.A social reformer will compare kundavai's<br />    diplomatic skills with seetha's jumping in fire and will say <br />kalki<br />    scores better in feminism than kamban.</p>
<p>    So its not possible to compare two works on every aspect.Its also<br />    difficult to agree upon a key comparable variable.If you hold <br />that<br />    feminism is the key important parameter,then how can I refuse <br />that?I<br />    cannot.I can only say "In these parameters he is better.My <br />knowledge<br />    is limited only in these areas.If somebody can come with some <br />other<br />    variable,I am happy to learn it"</p>

<blockquote><p>  Ok, agreed that tamizh prose was non existent before the 19th <br />century,<br />  I would still say that Kamban's Ramayana has such a keen following<br />  because of the way kamban uses the language. I remember my first<br />  introduction to kamban was my dad reading me four little lines<br />  (Ainthil Onnai etc etc.. I am sure you all know the lines I am <br />talking<br />  about).. I was struck by the beauty of the language..</p>
<p>  With kalki's PS, I don't think there is any passage that simply <br />stuns<br />  you with its beauty.. linguistically speaking. So i am not so sure<br />  that simply comparing characterizations and the story itself is <br />right.<br />  Surely, when comparing two writers, one must also compare their <br />use of<br />  the language. By taking that out of the equation, you are surely<br />  handicapping Kamban, since THAT was his greatest asset, wasn't it?</p>
<p>  Again, people who know both Kamban and Kalki have more "Thaguthi" <br />than<br />  me to comment on this, and so, would definitely like to know more <br />of<br />  your views.</p>

Kamban was a poet... Kalki was a storywriter.<br />     Perhaps Kalki was a better story writer than Kamban whereas <br />Kamban was<br />     a far superior poet to Kalki? How about that folks?</p>
<p>    No. It is not comparing oranges &amp; apples. The mode stories were <br />conveyed<br />    prior to Pratapa Mudaliyar Charithiram was in poetic mode. <br />Looking at it<br />    this way makes both Kambar and Kalki comparable. </p>
<p>    So what we are comparing is the storey itself and the way <br />characters were<br />    portrayed. </p>

          kamban Vs Kalki        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Ok, agreed that tamizh prose was non existent before the 19th century,<br />I would still say that Kamban's Ramayana has such a keen following<br />because of the way kamban uses the language. I remember my first<br />introduction to kamban was my dad reading me four little lines<br />(Ainthil Onnai etc etc.. I am sure you all know the lines I am talking<br />about).. I was struck by the beauty of the language..</p>
<p>With kalki's <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , I don't think there is any passage that simply stuns<br />you with its beauty.. linguistically speaking. So i am not so sure<br />that simply comparing characterizations and the story itself is right.<br />Surely, when comparing two writers, one must also compare their use of<br />the language. By taking that out of the equation, you are surely<br />handicapping Kamban, since THAT was his greatest asset, wasn't it?</acronym></p>
<p>Again, people who know both Kamban and Kalki have more "Thaguthi" than<br />me to comment on this, and so, would definitely like to know more of<br />your views.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>  No. It is not comparing oranges &amp; apples. The mode stories were conveyed<br />  prior to Pratapa Mudaliyar Charithiram was in poetic mode. Looking at it<br />  this way makes both Kambar and Kalki comparable. </p>

<p>  DearAll,</p>
<p>  Thats a great thread going on. QUite interesting. My personal feeling<br />  is that, people out here, Sri, Ganesan et al. are hard core Kalki<br />  fans that you are not able to digest any kind of critisism against<br />  him. Just the feeling I got when I read your mails. We are not<br />  fighting here who is great, but just comparing and contrasting<br />  character sketch. I am not for or agains Kalki or Kambar. We should<br />  appreaciate those immortals for their work. If I am in this group for<br />  any reason, its because of Kalki and I think so is any other member<br />  of this group. I think Sampath has his points valid and so is Sri.</p>
<p>  I like to differ Sampath on the Hero worship thing. I am reading PS<br />  for the second time now and just completed the first part yesterday.<br />  But in the first part, RR appears only in a couple of chapters. His<br />  introduction is not that elaborative as that of Vandiyathevan.<br />  Actually the hero of PS is Vanthiyathevan and not exactly RR. RR is<br />  the second hero. Thats my view. Maybe its Kalkis style and greatness<br />  to show the great RR in the eyes of Vandhiyathevan. But througout,<br />  never Kalki worships any of the character, and again thats my opinion.</p>
<p>  Re. the politics played by RR...its arasiyal. if he doesnt play that<br />  he is not going to be a king. Its justified in arasiyal. Every king<br />  has done that. Even during our trip to Manimangalam, Kamal, Shankaran<br />  and I were talking about the killing of UC son by RR in the name of<br />  punishment. We said that 'RJ kaga UC payana RR potu thallitan, in the<br />  name of punishment. RR onnum periya sathyaseelan ella..'. I feel RR<br />  as Great because he was humble enough to praise the efforts of his<br />  subordinates. I was overwhelmed to learn about the Talicheri kalvetu<br />  where he thanked and praised every labourer who worked for the big<br />  temple. Thats his greatness.</p>
<p>  Coming to Kamban, i think there were serveral many critics in the<br />  past thousand years, who have torn apart kambans work and still could<br />  not find fault and thats why he is kavichakravarthy still. I have not<br />  read Kamba ramayanam,but hearing its glory itself I am mesmerised.</p>
<p>  Actually I reply to mails only after reading all the mails. When I<br />  read Sri's mail on the timezone concept i thought I will reply<br />  later...but when I read the paragraph at the start of this mail from<br />  Sampath, I thought I will write, because he just spoke what I ws<br />  thinking of replying. I was thinking of the Uthyrayana and<br />  dhakshinayana concept. And I also feel that Meru should be North pole<br />  and not Himalayan range. The directions of Meru are given in<br />  Thriuvilayadal puranam, bagavatham etc. I suppose. when I read, i<br />  felt it should be North Pole. So its very much possible to see sun<br />  set in NP by Hanuman when he already saw it in Lanka. Why so far?<br />  When its dar is Chennai, its still possible to see light in Gujrat..i<br />  think Sri will accept this. Because even from east to west as you<br />  say, the shadow of the sunset does not fall as a vertical line from<br />  North to south..Its a diagonal line due to the axis of earth. Hope<br />  you will agree with this. So taking all this into consideration, we<br />  can assume that Kambar or during his time, these concepts were known.<br />  Doesnt it make us feel great to know that 1000 years back our<br />  ancestors mastered the astronomy and geography and could use it in<br />  their literature?</p>
<p>  Hope the thead brings in more knowledge to the group members.Quite<br />  interesting really.</p>

        <p>To answer satish arunachalam,<br />To think further about it I think that the meru mentioned <br />in ramayana and our epics in northpole only.Meru is supposed to be <br />the center of the earth and is always in the north.And our holy <br />texts say that people always fasted to the north.Himalayas isnt <br />north to many places were hindus lived.For example till 6th century <br />AD afghanisthan was aryan country.Certainly those people also must <br />have worshipped north.But for them himalayas was in east.</p>
<p>Only northpole is north to all.I will do further research <br />on this sometime next week.But we all know that ancient indians were <br />skilled in astronomy.</p>
<p>And I am not blaming <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  for playing politics.My only <br />fault with <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  is why he didnt play politics early and did not become <br />king immediatly after sundara chola?Had he done that he would have <br />become the greatest emperor af all times,since he would have become <br />king at the prime of his youth.Without playing politics(can i use <br />the word strategy instead? without using stratgey nobody is <br />qualified enough to be a king.Uthamas 16 years are a colossal waste <br />for chola desam.</acronym></acronym></p>

We said that 'RJ kaga UC payana RR potu thallitan, in <br />the <br />  name of punishment. RR onnum periya sathyaseelan ella..'. I feel <br />RR <br />  as Great because he was humble enough to praise the efforts of his <br />  subordinates. I was overwhelmed to learn about the Talicheri <br />kalvetu <br />  where he thanked and praised every labourer who worked for the big <br />  temple. Thats his greatness.</p>
<p>  Coming to Kamban, i think there were serveral many critics in the <br />  past thousand years, who have torn apart kambans work and still <br />could <br />  not find fault and thats why he is kavichakravarthy still. I have <br />not <br />  read Kamba ramayanam,but hearing its glory itself I am mesmerised.</p>
<p>  Actually I reply to mails only after reading all the mails. When I <br />  read Sri's mail on the timezone concept i thought I will reply <br />  later...but when I read the paragraph at the start of this mail <br />from <br />  Sampath, I thought I will write, because he just spoke what I ws <br />  thinking of replying. I was thinking of the Uthyrayana and <br />  dhakshinayana concept. And I also feel that Meru should be North <br />pole <br />  and not Himalayan range. The directions of Meru are given in <br />  Thriuvilayadal puranam, bagavatham etc. I suppose. when I read, i <br />  felt it should be North Pole. So its very much possible to see sun <br />  set in NP by Hanuman when he already saw it in Lanka. Why so far? <br />  When its dar is Chennai, its still possible to see light in <br />Gujrat..i <br />  think Sri will accept this. Because even from east to west as you <br />  say, the shadow of the sunset does not fall as a vertical line <br />from <br />  North to south..Its a diagonal line due to the axis of earth. Hope <br />  you will agree with this. So taking all this into consideration, <br />we <br />  can assume that Kambar or during his time, these concepts were <br />known. <br />  Doesnt it make us feel great to know that 1000 years back our <br />  ancestors mastered the astronomy and geography and could use it in <br />  their literature? </p>
<p>  Hope the thead brings in more knowledge to the group members.Quite <br />  interesting really.</p>

<p>DearAll,</p>
<p>Thats a great thread going on. QUite interesting. My personal feeling <br />is that, people out here, Sri, Ganesan et al. are hard core Kalki <br />fans that you are not able to digest any kind of critisism against <br />him. Just the feeling I got when I read your mails. We are not <br />fighting here who is great, but just comparing and contrasting <br />character sketch. I am not for or agains Kalki or Kambar. We should <br />appreaciate those immortals for their work. If I am in this group for <br />any reason, its because of Kalki and I think so is any other member <br />of this group. I think Sampath has his points valid and so is Sri. </p>
<p>I like to differ Sampath on the Hero worship thing. I am reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  <br />for the second time now and just completed the first part yesterday. <br />But in the first part, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  appears only in a couple of chapters. His <br />introduction is not that elaborative as that of Vandiyathevan. <br />Actually the hero of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is Vanthiyathevan and not exactly <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym . <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  is <br />the second hero. Thats my view. Maybe its Kalkis style and greatness <br />to show the great <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  in the eyes of Vandhiyathevan. But througout, <br />never Kalki worships any of the character, and again thats my opinion.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Re. the politics played by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym ...its arasiyal. if he doesnt play that <br />he is not going to be a king. Its justified in arasiyal. Every king <br />has done that. Even during our trip to Manimangalam, Kamal, Shankaran <br />and I were talking about the killing of UC son by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  in the name of <br />punishment. We said that '<acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym  kaga UC payana <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  potu thallitan, in the <br />name of punishment. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  onnum periya sathyaseelan ella..'. I feel <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  <br />as Great because he was humble enough to praise the efforts of his <br />subordinates.

        <p>Dear Sampath<br />I agree with you that you can compare across the board but would <br />still stand by my statement...</p>
<p>If you visit the archives of our group there was a opinion poll and <br />discussion on whi has illustrated Kalkis charectors better<br />Maniam or Vinu....I like Vinus pictures more than maniams but our <br />freind Gokul gave an excellent reason why Maniam is better than Vinu<br />Because it was from his imagination...He gave life to the charectors <br />Kalki created.....Vinu Just improvised....</p>
<p>Kavichakravarthy is great in his literary skills but he had a sory <br />line He had charectoristics of his charectors...He couldnt make <br />Jadayu a human or vice versa....</p>
<p>Where as Kalki had to decide if he wanted to give Vikrama kesari a <br />beard...</p>
<p>So creativity is an integral part of literary excellence...</p>
<p>Second point Ill beg to differ is Kalkis charectors are human and <br />down to earth...<br />They are not praised because they are the heroes...</p>
<p>The great prince Adithya accepts he was may be wrong in killing a <br />wounded Veera pandyan...</p>
<p>A chaste Arul mozhi dreams of going to faraway lands with <br />Poonguzhali...</p>
<p>Kundavai is partial to Vanathi....</p>
<p>All because they are Human and at no point does Kalki Glorify or <br />Worship them</p>
<p>Ram Deserved it and he was a divine avatar....</p>
<p>but <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  was just human and thats how Kalki has potrayed him...</p>
<p>Regards</p>

          kamban Vs Kalki        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Thats quite interesting. My doubt is...if Kambars samadhi exists <br />after roughly 1000 years, why not <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's or <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym 's ....when a poets <br />samadhi is remembered and worshiped, wouldnt there be efforts done by <br /><acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym  or his son to hail <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym  respectively...Any information <br />available on this? Just curious to know.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>To the group members, who are interested in purchasing books...As far <br />I have seen, 'New BookLands' in North Usman Road, T.Nagar, Opp. to <br />ARR building, has wonderful collection of Tamil (even english) <br />literature. Worth visiting the shop. I bet you wont walk out without <br />a buying atleast a book if you step in casually. The shop is at the <br />basement of the building.</p>
<p>Re. Kalki and Kambar...both has their unique way of characterisation. <br />As Sampath says, telling a story already known to millions and making <br />it a success is something great. C.Sundar is hailed a good comedy <br />director because, he could reproduce Sabash Meena as Ullathai alli <br />tha, with the same story and still made it a big hit. Though the last <br />10 years gave a lot of comedy hits, still ullathai alli tha is one <br />amoung the chartbusters, with the story retold. </p>
<p>Kambar not only polished the characters, his descriptions of events <br />and places are precise and sometimes scietific. I remember reading <br />one instance which surprised me a lot. When Lakshmana fell <br />unconscious by Indrajits Brahmastiram Hanuman goes to fetch the <br />mooligai from a hill near Mount Meru. It seems Kambar gives beautful <br />preicise direction and description of the locationn etc. The main <br />point is, Hanuman starts from Lanka in the late evening and half way <br />the sun sets and it becomes dark. But when he reaches the vicinity of <br />the mountain range, he is shocked to see the Sun rise..He thinks he <br />hs travelled the whole night and the next morning sun is rising and <br />feels very bad that He cannot save lakshmana. Immediately he becomes <br />aware of the fact that he is seeing the sun in the west and not in <br />the east and so its sun set and not the sun rise. The beauty here is <br />the timezone factor is know to Kambar. TOday we know that Sun sets <br />later in western regions than the eastern regions. So by the time <br />Hanuman reaches the mountain region, he has crossed the timezone <br />region and again seeing the sun set of the same evening. I also read <br />in another article in which researchers have deduced that Hanuman <br />would have travelled at 600km per hour from and to Lanka.Isnt it <br />amazing. 1000 years back a poet is well versed in science of timezone <br />concepts. Such minute details make Kambar 'KaviChakravarthy'.</p>
<p>Again Kambar didnt translate Valmikis ramayana. Its a completely new <br />version of the same story. Since its Ithihas (history) many scenes <br />cannot be changed, but sure Kambar stamped his uniqueness in every <br />line. Tulasidas was inspired to write Ramayan in Hindi, by <br />KambaRamayanam and not valmiki ramayanam. </p>
<p>But Kalki is also great in his own ways. Even today we are puzzedled <br />as who is the real character and who is the imaginary character.SUch <br />a beautiful blend of characters in the story. As Sampath says, <br />Vairamuthu can also be called Kaviarasu,but still he is no way close <br />to kannadasan. similarly no one can match kambar.</p>

<p>Even today, new born babies are brought to this samadhi of Kambar and<br />prayers are held. They apply the sand at the samadhi as vibhoothi on the<br />child's forehead and say "kaNNE kaniyamuthE, kamban pOl kavipaadu".

<p>=================<br />Dear Sri, that's a very good tribute to Kalki !</p>
<blockquote><p>After crossing Tindivanam - before Vikaravandi (may be something to do with </p></blockquote>
<p>Vikrama chozha !?) at a curve there is a road leading to Esaalam @ <br />Ennayiram. There is a present day stone inscription indicating that <br />Ennayiram is where KAMBAR was born! This place is also known as Brahmadesam.</p>
<p>Esalam is closer to Ennayiram where Rajendra Chozha constructed a Siva <br />Temple for his Sivaguru - Sivagnana pandithar. Bronzes and copper plates <br />unearthed from a underground chamber about 20 years back by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym . </p>
<p>Esalam copper plates of Rajendra Chozha confirm that Aditha Karikalan <br />killed Veerapandiyan, beheaded him and displayed his decayed head in front <br />of Tanjore Fort!</p>
<p><acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  Nadana Kasinathan has written a book on this. Sekar Pathippagam, KK <br />Nagar, Chennai.</acronym></p>
<p>Ennayiram is supposed to be colonised by the Jains. Nearby Kundavi's <br />Jinalayam existed. Rock beds of Jains found even today. </p>
<p>Rajara's one daugher was known as MADEVADIGAL - sister of Rajendra &amp; <br />Kundavi - also known as "Naduvirpenn" says Thiruvalanzhi inscription.<br />Some opined that she adopted Jainism, but there is evidence that others <br />were also called as Madevadigal. However, Kundavai's affinity to <br />Jinalayam, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym /RC donating villages to Budha Vihars might have been having <br />stronger reasons than SECULARISTIC views of the Throne alone !</acronym></p>
<p>Ennayiram is where the Ashta Sahasra Brahmins originally hailed from, is <br />another view...</p>
<p>Finally Ennayiram was also a capital city of Kulothiunga and there was a <br />large Vedic college, says Rajavelu <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym .</p>
<p>Thus Chozha (Kalkii) and Rama (Kambar) connections ...</p>
<p>Today is Deepam day ! For more illumination of future ..</p>
<p>fondly, sps</p></acronym></p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sridhar Rathnam,</p>
<p>The most pleasurable method of enjoying literature is comparing <br />works across different timelines.Its perfectly normal to compare <br />Rajeshkumar with shakesphere and debate.</p>
<p>This is not an insult to both but is a method of literary <br />commentary.It makes it interesting.How does shakesphere compare with <br />bernard shah on characterization?it will be interesting to see <br />people lining up on both sides and throwing view points.Arts and <br />literature grow by this method.</p>
<p>Now coming to your reasons for rating kalki above kambar</p>
<p>1)Kambar's story line was already known.</p>
<p>Yes,that makes what he did even more commendable.He did <br />not rule a virgin territory.He did what valmigi and countless others <br />did in an exceptional way and showed that his style of presentation <br />was way above others.A winning script doesnt necessarily need <br />suspense as an element.Many movies are based on succesful novels.All <br />know the story and end,but see the movie only for the way in which <br />the story is told.Story is skeleton.screenplay is flesh and poetic <br />words and kavi alangaram are the decoration.</p>
<p>A story being remake doesnt matter.How it is told matters.</p>
<p>"They met each other"--sentence.</p>
<p>"Their eyes ate each other"--masterpiece.</p>
<p>And also a work being ancient in no way makes it great.There were <br />many poets after kambar,but if you ask poets to rank all time greats <br />it will be kambar,valluvar and bharathi.</p>
<p>Vairamuthu dared to call himself kaviarasu,challenging <br />kannadasan,but he never dared to call himself as <br />kavichakravarthy.Becasue he knows that only kambar deserved that <br />title.</p>
<p>kambar stands worlds apart from others.</p>
<p>regards<br />sampath</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Sampath</p>
<p>  That was a very nice opening series of mail...I havent read Kamba <br />ramayanam so cannot agree or disagree but if you are comparing Kalki </p></blockquote>
<p>to Kambar ever Kalki will agree its a great honour....</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  But is that a justified comparision....My reasons for rating kalki <br />above Kambar....</p>
<p>  Kalki's charectors were all his creations....Kambars charectors <br />were created by Valmiki...the story line was set the suspense was </p></blockquote>
<p>over....</p>
<blockquote><p>  its like SJ Surya saying in Kushi Ivan than hero iva than heroine <br />ivanga seraporanga eppadi sera porangangrathu than kathai....</p>
<p>  But for kalki his base was RRs ascension to throne or Mammalar's <br />Vathapi vadam and created a whole story line plots and subplots......</p>
<p>  I think we have to give credit to originality as opposed to <br />remake....thats exactly what it is isnt it a story line improved and </p></blockquote>
<p>improvised by the creator....</p>
<blockquote><p>  Next is the timeline.....Kambar wrote his excellent treatise in a <br />contemporary literary language....</p>
<p>  Kalki wrote a historical novel in a different stance and language <br />to contemporary parlance and still reached hundreds of thousand </p></blockquote>
<p>people...</p>
<blockquote><p>  If Kalki had lived in Kulothunga's era...we ll probably be saying <br />Kalki veetu Kadavum Kadhai Sollum</p>
<p>  Its not any disrespect to the greatest tamil literary work of <br />Kambar but my personal veiw point</p>
<p>  Regards</p>
<p>  Sri</p>
<p>  (ps ...it would be nice if we all signed off so that the responder <br />can address the person by name or profile rather than freind or </p></blockquote>
<p>member...sampaths last three mails dont have his name I didnt feel <br />like addressing him Rojatraders....Its just me being Pedantic!!!!)</p>
