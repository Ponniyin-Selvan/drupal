        <p>Hi Sathish</p>
<p>since you go so often to pune please visit the bhandarkar institute.<br />full rooms of different versions of mahabarata, ramayana vedas.<br />sanskrit and english versions.<br />I went there chasing a story line for a book and coulnt find it.<br />but i realised that there is the largest set of info in oriental <br />research<br />another problem is that you cant browse. you need to know what you <br />are looking for. refer an old index box and tell the people who will <br />get the book for you in the reading room<br />venketesh</p>

<p>history on literature, thats hailed and we </p>
<blockquote><p>  say we should learn from them. But Sri, there are so many Indians <br />  who say that Mahabaratha and Ramayana are just literature and <br />cannot <br />  be treated as History. Strong belivers of Hindus will realise that <br />  they are not mere fiction but history indeed.</p>
<p>  Lots and lots of stories are spread across the vedas, which are <br />  brushed aside as pure fiction by many pagutharivalars. Even some <br />  three years back, we had a heated argument in our group regarding <br />  vedas and many of the vedic beliefs were criticised as being pro-<br />  brahminical. Same lack of evidences were pointed out then, to <br />subdue <br />  the supremacy of vedas.</p>
<p>  So where we stand? are we behaving like politicians who bend the <br />  rules based on the benefits?</p>
<p>  I am not a regular follower of Madan's qa sessions, but whatever I <br />  have read, even for the simplest of the answers a lot of research <br />  has been done. When such a learned person says something, we <br />cannot <br />  brush aside them just like that.</p>
<p>  I accept that we do have information in bits and pices. Many have <br />  been destroyed by rivalry, either pandya invasion or muslim <br />  invasion. My point is when Indians or the historians turn blind to <br />  accept many of the facets of Indian Hisotory/Hinduism (eg. to <br />accept <br />  the aryan invasion theory as myth, because if accepted, Hinduism <br />  become native to India), will the same Indians or historians <br />accept <br />  the literature or our commitment to show our supremacy? </p>
<p>  We cant have double standard you see.</p>

        <p>Dear Satish<br />I totally agree with you..<br />Part of the problem is Mahabaratha,ramayana and vedas are classic works andare based on history....if they are not then vyasa has one hell of a crative power...<br />I think the problem with them to be treated as history is that they have become more than history in indian minds...as divine works..</p>
<p>Dear Venkat<br />I agree that brits speak the truth and publish but as far as athe common man...arthur is still a legend..<br /><a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server.php?show=conProperty.316" title="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server.php?show=conProperty.316">http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server.php?show=conProperty.316</a><br />thats the like to tintagel castle ...where visitors are welcomed with searching for arthur...</p>
<p>this is a part of english heritage...</p>
<p>I agree and disagree regarding kamls response...the sangam literature he chose was to counter the statement poets just dranke ale and wrote lies...</p>
<p>I agree with Chola pass evidence or lack of evidence</p>
<p>But I still stand my ground that a respected author should have been dismissive</p>

But Sri, there are so many Indians <br />who say that Mahabaratha and Ramayana are just literature and cannot <br />be treated as History. Strong belivers of Hindus will realise that <br />they are not mere fiction but history indeed.</satisharun@gmail.com></p>
<p>Lots and lots of stories are spread across the vedas, which are <br />brushed aside as pure fiction by many pagutharivalars. Even some <br />three years back, we had a heated argument in our group regarding <br />vedas and many of the vedic beliefs were criticised as being pro-<br />brahminical. Same lack of evidences were pointed out then, to subdue <br />the supremacy of vedas.</p>
<p>So where we stand? are we behaving like politicians who bend the <br />rules based on the benefits?</p>
<p>I am not a regular follower of Madan's qa sessions, but whatever I <br />have read, even for the simplest of the answers a lot of research <br />has been done. When such a learned person says something, we cannot <br />brush aside them just like that.</p>
<p>I accept that we do have information in bits and pices. Many have <br />been destroyed by rivalry, either pandya invasion or muslim <br />invasion. My point is when Indians or the historians turn blind to <br />accept many of the facets of Indian Hisotory/Hinduism (eg. to accept <br />the aryan invasion theory as myth, because if accepted, Hinduism <br />become native to India), will the same Indians or historians accept <br />the literature or our commitment to show our supremacy? </p>
<p>We cant have double standard you see.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Heard of King Authur </p></blockquote>
<p>sure Sri. lots about him.<br />and not all britons take him as a hero or even as one who existed</p>
<p>here's a tidbit on the king and his round table.( YOU live in a very <br />honest country , I envy you)</p>
<p>The "history of arthur " by Geoffrey of Monmouth contains little <br />trustworthy historical fact, and many scholars are tempted to agree <br />with William of Newburgh, who wrote around 1190 that "it is quite <br />clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, <br />or indeed about his predecessors from Vortigern onwards, was made up, <br />partly by himself and partly by others, either from an inordinate <br />love of lying, or for the sake of pleasing the Britons."</p>
<p>a historian of 1190 disputes the history of their greatest legend.<br />wish we had more like him around.<br />debate is healthy for progress. if one feared critiscm you wont go <br />the next step.</p>

        <p>Hi Sri<br />just to continue the debate</p>
<blockquote><p>  1.Lack of evidence doesnt mean the theory is wrong before <br />dismissing it...</p></blockquote>
<p>what theory are we talking about. we all agree that the cholas were <br />great. otherwise we wouldnt be here in the first place.</p>
<blockquote><p>  We lack that commitment and we constantly criticise the ones who do <br />it...</p></blockquote>
<p>extravagant praise does a lot more damage than critiscm.<br />I wish somebody would translate kamals answer and post it in the <br />group. then people can decide for themselves whether it was a <br />"Sattaiyadi for madan " that you christened it.<br />do you beleive kamal's mail was a fit answer to madans question<br />if you recall<br />kamal quoted from poetry ( which was precisely what madan said)<br />kamal was throwing around hearsay tidbits like the "chola pass"<br />for most of the time kamal was talking about a small clan in remote <br />tamilnadu. in what way has the geneology of the pazhuvur clan <br />drastically shaped tamil history? in fact kamal was talking about <br />something he was strong at. though it was not even remotely connected <br />with the question being asked.<br />lastly you saw kamals wordings. he asks madan " how can you say <br />karikalan did not go to the himalayas. can you prove that he did not <br />go?"<br />when somebody is asking you prove a point do you ask him "can you <br />prove its not true? thats not how true sciences operate.</p>
<p>the answer stirred up passions that tend to blind us. <br />it was not a fit answer to the question asked.in fact it didnt even <br />resemble an answer.<br />calling it in all dramatic wordings as a "bagiranga kaditham" will <br />not help. it should have the stuff within.<br />everybody who has spent time on the tamil history knows there are <br />huge lacuna. why do want to hide behind passions of patriotism.<br />those will put us behind politicians who make their living by <br />stirring up such stuff.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>

<p>    recently i attended a book release function.<br />    Vaali's poems on karunanithi. 5 poets recited their<br />    poems on the cm.<br />    pa vijay, palani barathi and vaali included. for<br />    somebody new to have <br />    beleived the 5 poets would have made them feel the<br />    tamil world is <br />    surviving only because of his endevour.<br />    I thought in this modern age this sychophancy works.<br />    how it must have <br />    been in those days.</p>

          [Hai Madan and well done Kamal        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>When Europeans base their history on literature, thats hailed and we <br />say we should learn from them. But Sri, there are so many Indians <br />who say that Mahabaratha and Ramayana are just literature and cannot <br />be treated as History. Strong belivers of Hindus will realise that <br />they are not mere fiction but history indeed.</p>
<p>Lots and lots of stories are spread across the vedas, which are <br />brushed aside as pure fiction by many pagutharivalars. Even some <br />three years back, we had a heated argument in our group regarding <br />vedas and many of the vedic beliefs were criticised as being pro-<br />brahminical. Same lack of evidences were pointed out then, to subdue <br />the supremacy of vedas.</p>
<p>So where we stand? are we behaving like politicians who bend the <br />rules based on the benefits?</p>
<p>I am not a regular follower of Madan's qa sessions, but whatever I <br />have read, even for the simplest of the answers a lot of research <br />has been done. When such a learned person says something, we cannot <br />brush aside them just like that.</p>
<p>I accept that we do have information in bits and pices. Many have <br />been destroyed by rivalry, either pandya invasion or muslim <br />invasion. My point is when Indians or the historians turn blind to <br />accept many of the facets of Indian Hisotory/Hinduism (eg. to accept <br />the aryan invasion theory as myth, because if accepted, Hinduism <br />become native to India), will the same Indians or historians accept <br />the literature or our commitment to show our supremacy? </p>
<p>We cant have double standard you see.</p>

<p>            Its good to hear that you are standing your<br />        ground.<br />            I am still wondering about one missing link.<br />    As<br />        per<br />            historical sources, there were the Thiru<br />    mandira<br />            olaikarars, who would write down the various<br />            requests of the kings. Over the years, there<br />        would<br />            have been thousands and lacs of Olais on<br />    various<br />            instructions, commands, and notifications<br />    and<br />        just<br />            like the current gazette system used by the<br />            government. It is definitely possible that<br />    these<br />            olais would survive the test of time, at<br />    least<br />        some<br />            would have definitely made it. Its just that<br />    we<br />        have<br />            not identified the source of these olais.<br />    These<br />            would possibily be safe in the private<br />        collection of<br />            many individuals or groups or people or<br />    society.<br />        Its<br />            just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>            Just another possibility, that we would have<br />            materials that we have overlooked ourselves.<br />        These<br />            would be authentic sources in the lines of<br />    what<br />        we<br />            need to validate and make use of.</p>

<p>            mere selling in hundreds &amp; thousands of a<br />    book<br />              does mean it is more authenticated than<br />    the<br />        books<br />              which sell less.</p>
<p>            mandan has his own achivements.</p>
<p>            Hi <br />            thats a good point.<br />            we do have art movies that get awards and<br />    dont<br />        run a<br />            day in the <br />            theatres.<br />            but will you disregard the achievement of<br />        rajinikant<br />            or mgr movies <br />            that run for a year.</p>
<p>            we are not comparing the historians and<br />    their<br />            achievements. but <br />            madan's book stands high on the podium as<br />    the<br />            highest selling history <br />            book in tamil.and even if the tens of<br />    thousands</p>

<p>            Hi Venkat,</p>
<p>            Its good to hear that you are standing your<br />        ground.<br />            I am still wondering about one missing link.<br />    As<br />        per<br />            historical sources, there were the Thiru<br />    mandira<br />            olaikarars, who would write down the various<br />            requests of the kings. Over the years, there<br />        would<br />            have been thousands and lacs of Olais on<br />    various<br />            instructions, commands, and notifications<br />    and<br />        just<br />            like the current gazette system used by the<br />            government. It is definitely possible that<br />    these<br />            olais would survive the test of time, at<br />    least<br />        some<br />            would have definitely made it. Its just that<br />    we<br />        have<br />            not identified the source of these olais.<br />    These<br />            would possibily be safe in the private<br />        collection of<br />            many individuals or groups or people or<br />    society.<br />        Its<br />            just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>            Just another possibility, that we would have<br />            materials that we have overlooked ourselves.<br />        These<br />            would be authentic sources in the lines of<br />    what<br />        we<br />            need to validate and make use of.</p>

<p>            mere selling in hundreds &amp; thousands of a<br />    book<br />              does mean it is more authenticated than<br />    the<br />        books<br />              which sell less.</p>
<p>            mandan has his own achivements.</p>
<p>            Hi <br />            thats a good point.<br />            we do have art movies that get awards and<br />    dont<br />        run a<br />            day in the <br />            theatres.<br />            but will you disregard the achievement of<br />        rajinikant<br />            or mgr movies <br />            that run for a year.</p>
<p>            we are not comparing the historians and<br />    their<br />            achievements. but <br />            madan's book stands high on the podium as<br />    the<br />            highest selling history <br />            book in tamil.and even if the tens of<br />    thousands</p>

        <p>Let us do digitization, indexing and reading of 100<br />palm leaf books from our group. It is a task we can<br />chew...</p>
<p>Any buyers of this idea?</p>

<blockquote><p>  Links given below will give some information on the<br />  National Mission for<br />  Manuscripts. There was a flurry of activity in<br />  2003/04, and manuscripts<br />  numbering in laks from Karnataka, Gujarat (maximum)<br />  and other states<br />  were identified from individuals for digitization.<br />  But now, there is not<br />  much news about its activities. Even the web sites<br />  are not updated. The<br />  most recent news I have seen, (last week), the<br />  National Centre for<br />  Performing Arts, the body entrusted with the<br />  project, froze distribution<br />  of funds to the manuscript mission, citing mal<br />  practices in withdrawal<br />  and spending. Let that be.</p>
<p>  In the early days, there was tremendous response,<br />  and teams visited a<br />  large number of villages/towns and collected<br />  manuscripts from<br />  individuals for digitization. They were overwhelmed<br />  by the quantity of<br />  manuscripts available, all over India. The momentum<br />  slackened and there<br />  was no publicity after some time. Not sure, how the<br />  manuscripts<br />  collected and digitized will be made available with<br />  proper indexing and<br />  search facility. I doubt whether the mission can<br />  mange this, with its<br />  inertia, availability of domain specific experts and<br />  facilities.</p>
<p>  My only sore issue is: our inability to have the<br />  evidence in a decoded<br />  printed format in our hands, is no justification to<br />  question our<br />  forefather's lack of historical sense and make fun<br />  of them. People like<br />  Madan who reach a wider reading public, must be<br />  sensitive about this.</p>
<p>  Unless the documents are available to a large group<br />  of committed and<br />  devout researchers for study and deciphering, what<br />  ever is collected may<br />  also be lost. Only IT savvy youngsters like in this<br />  group, can find a<br />  solution for this 'himalayan' problem.<br />  Sampath</p>

<p>Can you talk to them again and win their confidence<br />?We can scan these palm leaves and give it back to<br />them.</p>
<p>It is a service to our nation and our duty too... they<br />should believe it and allow digitization of the palm<br />leaf books.</p>
<p>We should also request them to donate it to a museum<br />where it could be properly preserved.</p>

The owner is living in<br />  Chennai so the house is<br />  uninhabitated. The palm leaves were quite dusty and<br />  the owner said it<br />  contained Ramayana. It was really old. The other<br />  houses are also really old<br />  so im suer there must such leaves in the other<br />  homes. There must such leaves<br />  in other houses too. Maybe we can scan them then and<br />  there. We might be<br />  saving something.</p>

<p>    Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>      u Ve Sa got a lot of palm leaf details from<br />      mithilaipatti in<br />      chettinad on shaivism.</p>
<p>    Thats why I insist that Chettinad is the last<br />  resort.<br />    Hidden treasures ( ie valuable palm leaves, copper<br />    plates and the like. Not just ivories &amp; jewellery<br />  )<br />    could be still found in Chettinad homes. It could<br />  even<br />    change the history. How about, if we find a lost<br />    Sangam Tamil literature in a Chettinad home?</p>
<p>    Somebody influential like you could only do it.<br />  Think<br />    about it... I'm willing to join you in this<br />  venture. I<br />    can also spend some money in this quest.</p>

<p>          Hi Venkat,</p>
<p>          Its good to hear that you are standing your<br />      ground.<br />          I am still wondering about one missing link.<br />  As<br />      per<br />          historical sources, there were the Thiru<br />  mandira<br />          olaikarars, who would write down the various<br />          requests of the kings. Over the years, there<br />      would<br />          have been thousands and lacs of Olais on<br />  various<br />          instructions, commands, and notifications<br />  and<br />      just<br />          like the current gazette system used by the<br />          government. It is definitely possible that<br />  these<br />          olais would survive the test of time, at<br />  least<br />      some<br />          would have definitely made it. Its just that<br />  we<br />      have<br />          not identified the source of these olais.<br />  These<br />          would possibily be safe in the private<br />      collection of<br />          many individuals or groups or people or<br />  society.<br />      Its<br />          just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>          Just another possibility, that we would have<br />          materials that we have overlooked ourselves.<br />      These<br />          would be authentic sources in the lines of<br />  what<br />      we<br />          need to validate and make use of.</p>

<p>          Its good to hear that you are standing your<br />      ground.<br />          I am still wondering about one missing link.<br />  As<br />      per<br />          historical sources, there were the Thiru<br />  mandira<br />          olaikarars, who would write down the various<br />          requests of the kings. Over the years, there<br />      would<br />          have been thousands and lacs of Olais on<br />  various<br />          instructions, commands, and notifications<br />  and<br />      just<br />          like the current gazette system used by the<br />          government. It is definitely possible that<br />  these<br />          olais would survive the test of time, at<br />  least<br />      some<br />          would have definitely made it. Its just that<br />  we<br />      have<br />          not identified the source of these olais.<br />  These<br />          would possibily be safe in the private<br />      collection of<br />          many individuals or groups or people or<br />  society.<br />      Its<br />          just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>          Just another possibility, that we would have<br />          materials that we have overlooked ourselves.<br />      These<br />          would be authentic sources in the lines of<br />  what<br />      we<br />          need to validate and make use of.</p>

<p>          mere selling in hundreds &amp; thousands of a<br />  book<br />            does mean it is more authenticated than<br />  the<br />      books<br />            which sell less.</p>
<p>          mandan has his own achivements.</p>
<p>          Hi <br />          thats a good point.<br />          we do have art movies that get awards and<br />  dont<br />      run a<br />          day in the <br />          theatres.<br />          but will you disregard the achievement of<br />      rajinikant<br />          or mgr movies <br />          that run for a year.</p>
<p>          we are not comparing the historians and<br />  their<br />          achievements. but <br />          madan's book stands high on the podium as<br />  the<br />          highest selling history <br />          book in tamil.and even if the tens of<br />  thousands</p>

<p>        Its good to hear that you are standing your<br />    ground.<br />        I am still wondering about one missing link. As<br />    per<br />        historical sources, there were the Thiru mandira<br />        olaikarars, who would write down the various<br />        requests of the kings. Over the years, there<br />    would<br />        have been thousands and lacs of Olais on various<br />        instructions, commands, and notifications and<br />    just<br />        like the current gazette system used by the<br />        government. It is definitely possible that these<br />        olais would survive the test of time, at least<br />    some<br />        would have definitely made it. Its just that we<br />    have<br />        not identified the source of these olais. These<br />        would possibily be safe in the private<br />    collection of<br />        many individuals or groups or people or society.<br />    Its<br />        just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>        Just another possibility, that we would have<br />        materials that we have overlooked ourselves.<br />    These<br />        would be authentic sources in the lines of what<br />    we<br />        need to validate and make use of.</p>

        <p>hi; just remembered something. A couple of weeks backmy father and i went to<br />Udayalur agrahaaram for a period of 2 days. We visited most of the<br />agrahaaram houses there. In one of the houses i saw a big bunch of really<br />really old palm leaves. The owner is living in Chennai so the house is<br />uninhabitated. The palm leaves were quite dusty and the owner said it<br />contained Ramayana. It was really old. The other houses are also really old<br />so im suer there must such leaves in the other homes. There must such leaves<br />in other houses too. Maybe we can scan them then and there. We might be<br />saving something.</p>

        <p>Links given below will give some information on the National Mission for<br />Manuscripts. There was a flurry of activity in 2003/04, and manuscripts<br />numbering in laks from Karnataka, Gujarat (maximum) and other states<br />were identified from individuals for digitization. But now, there is not<br />much news about its activities. Even the web sites are not updated. The<br />most recent news I have seen, (last week), the National Centre for<br />Performing Arts, the body entrusted with the project, froze distribution<br />of funds to the manuscript mission, citing mal practices in withdrawal<br />and spending. Let that be.</p>
<p>In the early days, there was tremendous response, and teams visited a<br />large number of villages/towns and collected manuscripts from<br />individuals for digitization. They were overwhelmed by the quantity of<br />manuscripts available, all over India. The momentum slackened and there<br />was no publicity after some time. Not sure, how the manuscripts<br />collected and digitized will be made available with proper indexing and<br />search facility. I doubt whether the mission can mange this, with its<br />inertia, availability of domain specific experts and facilities.</p>
<p>My only sore issue is: our inability to have the evidence in a decoded<br />printed format in our hands, is no justification to question our<br />forefather's lack of historical sense and make fun of them. People like<br />Madan who reach a wider reading public, must be sensitive about this.</p>
<p>Unless the documents are available to a large group of committed and<br />devout researchers for study and deciphering, what ever is collected may<br />also be lost. Only IT savvy youngsters like in this group, can find a<br />solution for this 'himalayan' problem.<br />Sampath</p>

<blockquote><p>  u Ve Sa got a lot of palm leaf details from<br />  mithilaipatti in <br />  chettinad on shaivism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thats why I insist that Chettinad is the last resort.<br />Hidden treasures ( ie valuable palm leaves, copper<br />plates and the like. Not just ivories &amp; jewellery )<br />could be still found in Chettinad homes. It could even<br />change the history. How about, if we find a lost<br />Sangam Tamil literature in a Chettinad home?</p>
<p>Somebody influential like you could only do it. Think<br />about it... I'm willing to join you in this venture. I<br />can also spend some money in this quest.</p>

<p>      Hi Venkat,</p>
<p>      Its good to hear that you are standing your<br />  ground.<br />      I am still wondering about one missing link. As<br />  per<br />      historical sources, there were the Thiru mandira<br />      olaikarars, who would write down the various<br />      requests of the kings. Over the years, there<br />  would<br />      have been thousands and lacs of Olais on various<br />      instructions, commands, and notifications and<br />  just<br />      like the current gazette system used by the<br />      government. It is definitely possible that these<br />      olais would survive the test of time, at least<br />  some<br />      would have definitely made it. Its just that we<br />  have<br />      not identified the source of these olais. These<br />      would possibily be safe in the private<br />  collection of<br />      many individuals or groups or people or society.<br />  Its<br />      just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>      Just another possibility, that we would have<br />      materials that we have overlooked ourselves.<br />  These<br />      would be authentic sources in the lines of what<br />  we<br />      need to validate and make use of.</p>

<p>      mere selling in hundreds &amp; thousands of a book<br />        does mean it is more authenticated than the<br />  books<br />        which sell less.</p>
<p>      mandan has his own achivements.</p>
<p>      Hi <br />      thats a good point.<br />      we do have art movies that get awards and dont<br />  run a<br />      day in the <br />      theatres.<br />      but will you disregard the achievement of<br />  rajinikant<br />      or mgr movies <br />      that run for a year.</p>
<p>      we are not comparing the historians and their<br />      achievements. but <br />      madan's book stands high on the podium as the<br />      highest selling history <br />      book in tamil.and even if the tens of thousands<br />  who<br />      bought it are <br />      idiots an achievement is an achievement.</p>
<p>      and authentication about vanthaarkal vendraarkal<br />  is<br />      not the issue <br />      here, madan has quoted from recognised sources.<br />      the very aspect that he refuses to do a book<br />  without<br />      materiel to <br />      substantiate it shows his commitment.<br />      we may not agree with him but we need to listen<br />  to<br />      him</p>

        <p>Dear Satish et al,</p>
<p>Reading the palm leaf can happen much later.</p>
<p>We need to urgently help scan all available palm leaf<br />books in a digital format.</p>
<p>Once preserved digitally, things can happen much later<br />- whenever people / funds are available.</p>
<p>Since our people dont know the value of such items,<br />and since they can be destroyed anytime, digitization<br />is to be done at high priority.</p>
<p>If we could help from our group in that, it will be<br />great. Our group will be remembered in history!</p>

<p>  Quoting uv.ve.sa, he says in his 'en sarithiram'<br />  that when he went <br />  in search of oolai chuvadis he was pained to hear<br />  that people have <br />  destroyed thousands of palm leaves either by burning<br />  or putting them <br />  in rivers. It seems people said they followed the<br />  tradition by which <br />  the palm leaves are supposed to be destroyed.</p>
<p>  Tamil thatha, with great anguish quotes that, this<br />  tradition of <br />  putting palm leaves in water or fire was done only<br />  when to old <br />  leaves are in the verge of destruction. People used<br />  to make a copy <br />  of the exisiting palm leaf and then destroy the old<br />  ones by putting <br />  in fire or water. But our later generations took<br />  only the half which <br />  was convinient to them (as we take all the<br />  convinient things from <br />  the west and leave out th good ones )</p>
<p>  In this way a lot of treasure has alredy been lost.</p>
<p>  Coming to the point of preserving the existing ones<br />  - already govt. <br />  organizations are working on it. Scanning and<br />  preserving the <br />  leaflets are not an easy joke. Whatever collection<br />  has been made, <br />  its still not yet catalogued. A three year project<br />  has been <br />  commissioned by the central govt. only to catalogue<br />  the available <br />  leaflets - like whats the name of the book, whos the<br />  author etc. <br />  After this it has to be read, deciphered, if<br />  relevant published etc. <br />  etc...</p>

<p>  I remember 2 incidents vaguely...</p>
<p>  1) When the grand father of Tamil ( Vu Ve Sa )<br />  reached<br />  a temple that kept the library of the Pandian King<br />  Sundara Pandian, he was informed that it was just<br />  burnt into ashes as they didnt have any purpose...</p>
<p>  2) A temple priest ( or a priestly man ) at Alwar<br />  Thirunagari ( it is a village between Tirunelveli<br />  and<br />  Tiruchendur with ancient temples ) possessed some<br />  palm<br />  leaf books and requested some scholars to take a<br />  look... No body in TN turned up, until somebody from<br />  Venkateshwara university.. . we dont know what was<br />  in<br />  those books,</p>
<p>  Recently a study of palm leaf books in possession of<br />  individuals in southern districts was taken and it<br />  was<br />  a big number... we dont know what is in them.. who<br />  will spend time / money to talk to these<br />  individuals,<br />  convince them to take a scanned copy, get it read<br />  and<br />  print / publish it....</p>
<p>  If we could get together and get the list from the<br />  govt body that did the census of palm leaf books,<br />  probably we could scan about 100 books during the<br />  summer vacation...</p>

<p>    Hi Venkat,</p>
<p>    Its good to hear that you are standing your<br />  ground.<br />    I am still wondering about one missing link. As<br />  per<br />    historical sources, there were the Thiru mandira<br />    olaikarars, who would write down the various<br />    requests of the kings. Over the years, there would<br />    have been thousands and lacs of Olais on various<br />    instructions, commands, and notifications and just<br />    like the current gazette system used by the<br />    government. It is definitely possible that these<br />    olais would survive the test of time, at least<br />  some<br />    would have definitely made it. Its just that we<br />  have<br />    not identified the source of these olais. These<br />    would possibily be safe in the private collection<br />  of<br />    many individuals or groups or people or society.<br />  Its<br />    just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>    Just another possibility, that we would have<br />    materials that we have overlooked ourselves. These<br />    would be authentic sources in the lines of what we<br />    need to validate and make use of.</p>

<p>    mere selling in hundreds &amp; thousands of a book<br />      does mean it is more authenticated than the<br />  books<br />      which sell less.</p>
<p>    mandan has his own achivements.</p>
<p>    Hi <br />    thats a good point.<br />    we do have art movies that get awards and dont run<br />  a<br />    day in the <br />    theatres.<br />    but will you disregard the achievement of<br />  rajinikant<br />    or mgr movies <br />    that run for a year.</p>
<p>    we are not comparing the historians and their<br />    achievements. but <br />    madan's book stands high on the podium as the<br />    highest selling history <br />    book in tamil.and even if the tens of thousands<br />  who<br />    bought it are <br />    idiots an achievement is an achievement.</p>
<p>    and authentication about vanthaarkal vendraarkal<br />  is<br />    not the issue <br />    here, madan has quoted from recognised sources.<br />    the very aspect that he refuses to do a book<br />  without<br />    materiel to <br />    substantiate it shows his commitment.<br />    we may not agree with him but we need to listen to<br />    him</p>

        <p>Hi Venkat,</p>
<p>Sorry for making you feel that way... <br />We need to understand that our resources are available and locating and tapping into resources is going to be a phenomenoal task. Are we upto task? Do we have the motivation and the commitment to do it.</p>
<p>You would have definitely known about the National archival mission to map the palm leaf manuscript across India. I did see only very few tamil works. There are definitely resources/societies/individuals who are officially or have personally committed to such endeavours.</p>
<p>Kalinga Bala had posted information on one such endeavour in virudhachalam, so why not talk to them?</p>

<p>the pandyas clearly wiped out traces of the cholas.the khiljis wiped <br />out pandya records. happens in history.<br />khusro and wassaf of the turkish army record 512 elephants loaded <br />with looted gold and precious stones. so it must have been a very <br />wealthy land.<br />but the arguments now are whether we have enough evidence to write <br />our history completely with out referring fictional sources.</p>

        <p>Is this the National palm leaf digitisation effort done by the Kanchi university also? Madan from our group or someone from our group did mention about such an activity that was/is done by Kanchi Kamakoti Univeristy also?

<p>I remember 2 incidents vaguely...</p>
<p>1) When the grand father of Tamil ( Vu Ve Sa ) reached<br />a temple that kept the library of the Pandian King<br />Sundara Pandian, he was informed that it was just<br />burnt into ashes as they didnt have any purpose...</p>
<p>2) A temple priest ( or a priestly man ) at Alwar<br />Thirunagari ( it is a village between Tirunelveli and<br />Tiruchendur with ancient temples ) possessed some palm<br />leaf books and requested some scholars to take a<br />look... No body in TN turned up, until somebody from<br />Venkateshwara university.. . we dont know what was in<br />those books,</p>
<p>Recently a study of palm leaf books in possession of<br />individuals in southern districts was taken and it was<br />a big number... we dont know what is in them.. who<br />will spend time / money to talk to these individuals,<br />convince them to take a scanned copy, get it read and<br />print / publish it....</p>
<p>If we could get together and get the list from the<br />govt body that did the census of palm leaf books,<br />probably we could scan about 100 books during the<br />summer vacation...</p>

<p>  Its good to hear that you are standing your ground.<br />  I am still wondering about one missing link. As per<br />  historical sources, there were the Thiru mandira<br />  olaikarars, who would write down the various<br />  requests of the kings. Over the years, there would<br />  have been thousands and lacs of Olais on various<br />  instructions, commands, and notifications and just<br />  like the current gazette system used by the<br />  government. It is definitely possible that these<br />  olais would survive the test of time, at least some<br />  would have definitely made it. Its just that we have<br />  not identified the source of these olais. These<br />  would possibily be safe in the private collection of<br />  many individuals or groups or people or society. Its<br />  just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>  Just another possibility, that we would have<br />  materials that we have overlooked ourselves. These<br />  would be authentic sources in the lines of what we<br />  need to validate and make use of.</p>

<p>  mere selling in hundreds &amp; thousands of a book<br />    does mean it is more authenticated than the books<br />    which sell less.</p>
<p>  mandan has his own achivements.</p>
<p>  Hi <br />  thats a good point.<br />  we do have art movies that get awards and dont run a<br />  day in the <br />  theatres.<br />  but will you disregard the achievement of rajinikant<br />  or mgr movies <br />  that run for a year.</p>
<p>  we are not comparing the historians and their<br />  achievements. but <br />  madan's book stands high on the podium as the<br />  highest selling history <br />  book in tamil.and even if the tens of thousands who<br />  bought it are <br />  idiots an achievement is an achievement.</p>
<p>  and authentication about vanthaarkal vendraarkal is<br />  not the issue <br />  here, madan has quoted from recognised sources.<br />  the very aspect that he refuses to do a book without<br />  materiel to <br />  substantiate it shows his commitment.<br />  we may not agree with him but we need to listen to<br />  him</p>

<p>Hi Nanda</p>
<p>I dont dis agree that we have had a fabulous history.<br />at least in the later history of tamil nadu we have had great <br />conquerors.<br />it was the momentum that they provided that enabled our society to <br />survive a millienium.</p>
<p>and history is not a static science. when authentic discoveries are <br />made changes have to be made in text books.<br />but unfortunately for us chola history has remained static after <br />nilakanda sastri's time.<br />it would be useful to debate what has been discovered after him.no <br />earth shaking discovery as people would lead you to beleive.<br />how do you imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . till i read ponniyin selvan i imagined him <br />from sivaji's movie. after ponniyin selvan i imagine him as a gentle <br />king who hurts no one. even refuses to plunder the country he <br />enslaves for food. he would rather let his soldiers starve.<br />sometimes a true history lover fels like screaming " will the real <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  please stand up?"</p>

It is definitely possible that these olais would survive <br />the test of time, at least some would have definitely made it. Its <br />just that we have not identified the source of these olais. These <br />would possibily be safe in the private collection of many individuals <br />or groups or people or society. Its just we need to find the source.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Just another possibility, that we would have materials that we have <br />overlooked ourselves. These would be authentic sources in the lines </p></blockquote>
<p>of what we need to validate and make use of.</p>

<p>  mere selling in hundreds &amp; thousands of a book<br />    does mean it is more authenticated than the books<br />    which sell less.</p>
<p>  mandan has his own achivements.</p>
<p>  Hi <br />  thats a good point.<br />  we do have art movies that get awards and dont run a day in the <br />  theatres.<br />  but will you disregard the achievement of rajinikant or mgr movies <br />  that run for a year.</p>
<p>  we are not comparing the historians and their achievements. but <br />  madan's book stands high on the podium as the highest selling <br />history <br />  book in tamil.and even if the tens of thousands who bought it are <br />  idiots an achievement is an achievement.</p>
<p>  and authentication about vanthaarkal vendraarkal is not the issue <br />  here, madan has quoted from recognised sources.<br />  the very aspect that he refuses to do a book without materiel to <br />  substantiate it shows his commitment.<br />  we may not agree with him but we need to listen to him</p>

        <p>VK and others,</p>
<p>There is every possibility that there can be valuable resources <br />hidden in some private collection, but practically speaking its <br />impossible. </p>
<p>without proper maintenance, it will crumble to pieces in a few <br />years. Preserving it for centuries - ruled out.</p>
<p>Quoting uv.ve.sa, he says in his 'en sarithiram' that when he went <br />in search of oolai chuvadis he was pained to hear that people have <br />destroyed thousands of palm leaves either by burning or putting them <br />in rivers. It seems people said they followed the tradition by which <br />the palm leaves are supposed to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Tamil thatha, with great anguish quotes that, this tradition of <br />putting palm leaves in water or fire was done only when to old <br />leaves are in the verge of destruction. People used to make a copy <br />of the exisiting palm leaf and then destroy the old ones by putting <br />in fire or water. But our later generations took only the half which <br />was convinient to them (as we take all the convinient things from <br />the west and leave out th good ones )</p>
<p>In this way a lot of treasure has alredy been lost.</p>
<p>Coming to the point of preserving the existing ones - already govt. <br />organizations are working on it. Scanning and preserving the <br />leaflets are not an easy joke. Whatever collection has been made, <br />its still not yet catalogued. A three year project has been <br />commissioned by the central govt. only to catalogue the available <br />leaflets - like whats the name of the book, whos the author etc. <br />After this it has to be read, deciphered, if relevant published etc. <br />etc...</p>

<p>  2) A temple priest ( or a priestly man ) at Alwar<br />  Thirunagari ( it is a village between Tirunelveli and<br />  Tiruchendur with ancient temples ) possessed some palm<br />  leaf books and requested some scholars to take a<br />  look... No body in TN turned up, until somebody from<br />  Venkateshwara university... we dont know what was in<br />  those books,</p>
<p>  Recently a study of palm leaf books in possession of<br />  individuals in southern districts was taken and it was<br />  a big number... we dont know what is in them.. who<br />  will spend time / money to talk to these individuals,<br />  convince them to take a scanned copy, get it read and<br />  print / publish it....</p>
<p>  If we could get together and get the list from the<br />  govt body that did the census of palm leaf books,<br />  probably we could scan about 100 books during the<br />  summer vacation...</p>

        <p>Hi<br />u Ve Sa got a lot of palm leaf details from mithilaipatti in <br />chettinad on shaivism. thats how he tabulated the paadal petra <br />sthalams.<br />what is the life of a palm leaf? who do we ask. any biologists in the <br />group?<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  2) A temple priest ( or a priestly man ) at Alwar<br />  Thirunagari ( it is a village between Tirunelveli and<br />  Tiruchendur with ancient temples ) possessed some palm<br />  leaf books and requested some scholars to take a<br />  look... No body in TN turned up, until somebody from<br />  Venkateshwara university... we dont know what was in<br />  those books,</p>
<p>  Recently a study of palm leaf books in possession of<br />  individuals in southern districts was taken and it was<br />  a big number... we dont know what is in them.. who<br />  will spend time / money to talk to these individuals,<br />  convince them to take a scanned copy, get it read and<br />  print / publish it....</p>
<p>  If we could get together and get the list from the<br />  govt body that did the census of palm leaf books,<br />  probably we could scan about 100 books during the<br />  summer vacation...</p>

<p>    Hi Venkat,</p>
<p>    Its good to hear that you are standing your ground.<br />    I am still wondering about one missing link. As per<br />    historical sources, there were the Thiru mandira<br />    olaikarars, who would write down the various<br />    requests of the kings. Over the years, there would<br />    have been thousands and lacs of Olais on various<br />    instructions, commands, and notifications and just<br />    like the current gazette system used by the<br />    government. It is definitely possible that these<br />    olais would survive the test of time, at least some<br />    would have definitely made it. Its just that we have<br />    not identified the source of these olais. These<br />    would possibily be safe in the private collection of<br />    many individuals or groups or people or society. Its<br />    just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>    Just another possibility, that we would have<br />    materials that we have overlooked ourselves. These<br />    would be authentic sources in the lines of what we<br />    need to validate and make use of.</p>

        <p>Hi Nanda</p>
<p>I dont dis agree that we have had a fabulous history.<br />at least in the later history of tamil nadu we have had great <br />conquerors.<br />it was the momentum that they provided that enabled our society to <br />survive a millienium.</p>
<p>and history is not a static science. when authentic discoveries are <br />made changes have to be made in text books.<br />but unfortunately for us chola history has remained static after <br />nilakanda sastri's time.<br />it would be useful to debate what has been discovered after him.no <br />earth shaking discovery as people would lead you to beleive.<br />how do you imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . till i read ponniyin selvan i imagined him <br />from sivaji's movie. after ponniyin selvan i imagine him as a gentle <br />king who hurts no one. even refuses to plunder the country he <br />enslaves for food. he would rather let his soldiers starve.<br />sometimes a true history lover fels like screaming " will the real <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  please stand up?"</p>

        <p>Hi Venkat,</p>
<p>Its good to hear that you are standing your ground. I am still wondering about one missing link. As per historical sources, there were the Thiru mandira olaikarars, who would write down the various requests of the kings. Over the years, there would have been thousands and lacs of Olais on various instructions, commands, and notifications and just like the current gazette system used by the government. It is definitely possible that these olais would survive the test of time, at least some would have definitely made it. Its just that we have not identified the source of these olais. These would possibily be safe in the private collection of many individuals or groups or people or society. Its just we need to find the source.</p>
<p>Just another possibility, that we would have materials that we have overlooked ourselves. These would be authentic sources in the lines of what we need to validate and make use of.</p>
<p>Regards<br />nanda</p>

        <p>hi; looking at the lighter side of things its really quite funny that the king<br />who the time to build some of the biggest structures in the ancient world,<br />conquer far away lands dint have time to just sit down and write about all<br />this. All he had to do was spend a month or so during his final years in<br />writing or sculpting his life. I find this very very wierd.<br />He dint even have to do it himself he could have got somebody to do it.<br />Looks like even <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  did not know how great he was and how the future<br />generations would admire him.</acronym></p>
<p>The same mistakes are being made even today. Lets compare the ancient<br />empires to the business empires of today. Almost every European or American<br />businessman or CEO (the really famous ones and the not so famous ones) take<br />time out to write books about how they got there, thier life, etc. Jack<br />Welch, Gates, Ricardo Semler, Sam Walton, etc. This way people learn about<br />thier exploits, mistakes, etc.</p>
<p>Can you name one Indian businessman who has written a book of his exploits?<br />Recently Kokila Ben launched a photograph collection of Dhirubhai Ambani's<br />life but nothing else. Even the incredible Mr. Narayana Murthy has written<br />very little about his life. Maybe im not aware of a few biogrpahies on<br />Indian businessmen but the truth is the cupboard is bare when we cmpare with<br />the Eurpeans and Americans. Thank god Dr.Kalam took time out for recording<br />this. Even in Indian cricket Sunil Gavaskar has a biography and maybe a few<br />other cricketers but absolutely nothing from some of the most incredible<br />talents like GRV (i cant remember reading even an interview from this<br />artist), Chandra, etc. Looks like we haven't learnt anything from our past.</p>

        <p>Natarajan sir,</p>
<p>Why do you take it as a pesimistic approach? Why cant we try to <br />answer these question? I am no way possess any knowledge in this <br />subject compared to the stalwarts in this group, and I do have a lot <br />of confidence on our rich and long lasting culture and history, but <br />when it comes to writing it down, we have to accept some <br />shortcomings.</p>
<p>We should admit that we dont have all the evidences to write Tamil <br />history. WE do have a lot of them but they are still not making the <br />ALL the needed stuff. I look it on a different perspective. I have <br />told this to Venkatesh a lot of times...our history is closely tied <br />with Religion. As per our religion nothing is stable and everyone <br />accepted it. Everyone had high regards for god and not for humans. <br />Thats why none of our ancestors showed much importance to human life <br />by recording the history, but recorded the lives of saints <br />(eg.periya puranam) and sang the glory of god (tirumurais)...</p>

Especially when he<br />mentions about poets that they praised the kings for<br />money and drinks when there is no need for Madan to<br />hang on unreliable evidences. There is a solid<br />evidence in these poems that the king and the poet are<br />contemporaries and this is big lead to find<br />contemporaries.</p>

<p>  his reference to mangoes on jahangirs breakfast<br />  table was a challenge.<br />  they have recorded even the king's breakfast. what<br />  do you really know <br />  about your kings.<br />  on the contrast our bunch of historians still quote<br />  poetry and <br />  hearsay stories and co incidences in words( like<br />  chola pass) to <br />  substantiate. we dont realise how funny it is to a<br />  TRUE historian.</p>
<p>  frankly we cant write more than a page on each<br />  battle of RRc.we dont <br />  even know when he died. we assume the year when his<br />  edicts stopped <br />  appearing. a similar study of such a great king in<br />  similar year ( for <br />  example william 1 of england) has enough matter to<br />  write a dozen <br />  volumes.</p>
<p>  and the contradictions. even the paintng assumed for<br />  long to be RRc <br />  above the big temple is being identified as somebody<br />  else by the <br />  esteemed historians of this group. whereas the<br />  copper plates say he <br />  was old enough to sacrifice the kingdom for his<br />  uncle a stone edict <br />  in thiru koviloor suggests he may have been just a<br />  baby when his <br />  father died.</p>
<p>  pazhuvettaraiyar is a big man for us because we love<br />  PS. but it is <br />  just a chance that you got their lineage intact.and<br />  there have been a <br />  thousand clans like pazhuvur. but the major things<br />  are still <br />  unanswered.<br />  I can tell you, inspite of all the rheotoric on<br />  behalf of the <br />  varalaaru team you cant write an authentic book<br />  about RRC with more <br />  than 24 pages with evidence available and can be<br />  coraborated by other <br />  sources. even that may be difficult.<br />  SEASONS PUBLISHING did a book on kings of india and<br />  while all other <br />  kings are written about with solid evidence the<br />  author had lifted <br />  RRc's story from ponniyin selvan.<br />  if we start seeing history as a science just like<br />  physics and <br />  chemistry it will not allow us to have a needless<br />  sentiment. this <br />  sentiment is what helps a lot of people go around in<br />  the clothing of <br />  historians.<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>    The letter was handed over to Vikatan in person by<br />  Ram<br />    and vikatan passed it to Madhan.

At that time, Iraianbu said lot of<br />  rejoinders<br />    were received from readers.</p>

<p>    Dear Kalavathy madam and Nandhakumar,</p>
<p>    There are lot of solid evidences to write<br />  tamilnadu<br />    history. It is us who refuse to look at them. Do<br />  you<br />    mean the works of K.A.Neelakanda Sasthiri,<br />    T.V.Sadhasiva Pandaraththaar, M.Rajamanickanaar,<br />    K.R.Srinivasan, etc are not authentic? They also<br />  used<br />    the same so called 'not recorded efficiently'<br />    evidences. After their era, lot of new findings<br />  were<br />    out and we have much more data to write our<br />  history<br />    perfectly. Those new findings definitely give<br />  better<br />    information than indian summer and mangoes.

<p>traces their history from the sun.<br />true all our atoms came from the sun. but isnt that too much.<br />we cant even directly and honestly connect the early cholas with the <br />later cholas. the gap is 500 years.<br />its not the medium that counts, its the sponsor.<br />whether its copper plates, or olai suvadi or kalvettu the man who <br />sponsors the writing gets a lions share of the publicity.<br />kamban himself compared major charecters in his ramayana to sadayappa <br />vallal who sponsered his daily expenses.</p>
<p>recently i attended a book release function.<br />Vaali's poems on karunanithi. 5 poets recited their poems on the cm.<br />pa vijay, palani barathi and vaali included. for somebody new to have <br />beleived the 5 poets would have made them feel the tamil world is <br />surviving only because of his endevour.<br />I thought in this modern age this sychophancy works. how it must have <br />been in those days.</p>

<p>this reminds me of the scene in Imsai Arasan, where Vadivelu is posing for a<br />painting of himself but with the body of a wrestler. He says "Varalaaru miga<br />mukkiyam amaichare". The kings of those eras would surely have exaggerated a<br />lot when describing thier victories in kalvettu and poems. They would have<br />noted down thier victories but would have conveniently forgotten to mention<br />thier failures.<br />I would like to know whether all Kalvettus are like this or how do we<br />authenticate that the kalvettu is historical account and not an exaggeration<br />by the sculptor to win gold coins from the emperor?<br />If we are not able to trust kalvettu,poems then on what do we base our<br />theories upon?The Copper plates? Doesn't this mean Madan is right?<br />Would it be possible for the people who are writing against Madan in this<br />group to prove that thier theories are based on findings which are more<br />authentic than poems and kalvettus? Can anybody list them?</p>

        <p>Stone edicts as evidence</p>
<p>in a few temples around thondai nadu we have chola inscriptions of <br />Raja raja in the walls of the inner sanctum.<br />photos of them have been published in our group photos section. <br />also there is an edict in each of these temples by one ' <br />THIRUBUVANACHAKRAVARTHI GOPALA THEVAR"<br />have you people heard of him? do we take hime to be a emperor just <br />because his edicts mention him as lord of the three worlds. he was a <br />local chieftan in the naik period.<br />it was then that i realised some edicts could be as sychophantic as <br />poetry.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>    A simple question on the Udalayur pallipadai, why cannot we as a <br />  group file a PIL saying that JV is publishing a wrong news item <br />there <br />  by misleading people?

<p>    Dear SPS, Sri and others,</p>
<p>    Thanks for bringing this to attention of the group and<br />    your kind words. I havent checked group mails for past<br />    couple of months. Yesterday i was told about these<br />    mails.</p>
<p>    The letter was handed over to Vikatan in person by Ram<br />    and vikatan passed it to Madhan. Also, it was given to<br />    Mr.Iraiyanbu when he met Dr.Kalaikkovan last week in<br />    Trichy. At that time, Iraianbu said lot of rejoinders<br />    were received from readers.</p>
<p>    We dont think vikatan will publish them. They already<br />    refused to publish our letter on Udaiyaloor<br />    pallippadai.</p>
<p>    Dear Kalavathy madam and Nandhakumar,</p>
<p>    There are lot of solid evidences to write tamilnadu<br />    history. It is us who refuse to look at them. Do you<br />    mean the works of K.A.Neelakanda Sasthiri,<br />    T.V.Sadhasiva Pandaraththaar, M.Rajamanickanaar,<br />    K.R.Srinivasan, etc are not authentic? They also used<br />    the same so called 'not recorded efficiently'<br />    evidences. After their era, lot of new findings were<br />    out and we have much more data to write our history<br />    perfectly. Those new findings definitely give better<br />    information than indian summer and mangoes. If<br />    possible, please read 'Kaala aaraaychi' by<br />    Dr.M.Rajamanickanaa r to understand how the chronology<br />    is fixed for tamil kings and literatures.</p>

        <p>Hi Kamal,</p>
<p>In no way, I am denying or turning a blind eye in the richness of our history &amp; culture. </p>
<p>A simple question on the Udalayur pallipadai, why cannot we as a group file a PIL saying that JV is publishing a wrong news item there by misleading people? This can definitely pull them up. The information on this PIL can then be sent to competitors of JV and Vikatan group. what say?</p>

<p>Dear SPS, Sri and others,</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this to attention of the group and<br />your kind words. I havent checked group mails for past<br />couple of months. Yesterday i was told about these<br />mails.</p>
<p>The letter was handed over to Vikatan in person by Ram<br />and vikatan passed it to Madhan. Also, it was given to<br />Mr.Iraiyanbu when he met Dr.Kalaikkovan last week in<br />Trichy. At that time, Iraianbu said lot of rejoinders<br />were received from readers.</p>
<p>We dont think vikatan will publish them. They already<br />refused to publish our letter on Udaiyaloor<br />pallippadai.</p>
<p>Dear Kalavathy madam and Nandhakumar,</p>
<p>There are lot of solid evidences to write tamilnadu<br />history. It is us who refuse to look at them. Do you<br />mean the works of K.A.Neelakanda Sasthiri,<br />T.V.Sadhasiva Pandaraththaar, M.Rajamanickanaar,<br />K.R.Srinivasan, etc are not authentic? They also used<br />the same so called 'not recorded efficiently'<br />evidences. After their era, lot of new findings were<br />out and we have much more data to write our history<br />perfectly. Those new findings definitely give better<br />information than indian summer and mangoes. If<br />possible, please read 'Kaala aaraaychi' by<br />Dr.M.Rajamanickanaa r to understand how the chronology<br />is fixed for tamil kings and literatures.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />Kamal</p>

<p>people are rather hesitant to publish a contradictory view.<br />there has been enough discussions in ponniyin selvan group last week <br />to literally demolish the CHOLA PASS THEORY mentioned in a very <br />knowledgable article in Varalaru.com <br />will varalaru.com publish our views which are contradictory to theirs?</p>
