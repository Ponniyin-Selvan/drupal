<p>  It is interesting to note that the gold looted by Muhammad Gauri and <br />  Muhammad Gajni was later confiscated from the Afghans by Maharaja <br />  Ranjeet Singh, the Lion of Punjab. He wanted to return the gold to <br />  the Somnath temple but since the temple was still very vulnerable to <br />  attacks, the priests of Somnath temple requested the maharaja to <br />  retain the gold with himself. The benevolent Maharaja then put the <br />  gold on the domes of the golden temple and installed the golden <br />  gates of Somnath around the Golden Temple in Amritsar.<br />-----------------</p></blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to note that the gold looted by Muhammad Gauri and <br />Muhammad Gajni was later confiscated from the Afghans by Maharaja <br />Ranjeet Singh, the Lion of Punjab. He wanted to return the gold to <br />the Somnath temple but since the temple was still very vulnerable to <br />attacks, the priests of Somnath temple requested the maharaja to <br />retain the gold with himself. The benevolent Maharaja then put the <br />gold on the domes of the golden temple and installed the golden <br />gates of Somnath around the Golden Temple in Amritsar.</p>

Among the large number of idols in the temples, five were made <br />  of pure gold, the eyes of one of them were laid with two rubies <br />  worth 100,000 dinars, and another had a sapphire of a very heavy <br />  weight. All these five idols yielded gold weighing 98,300 <br />mishkals. <br />  The idols made of silver numbered 200??. He seized all the gold <br />and <br />  silver idols and ordered his soldiers to burn all the temples to <br />the <br />  ground. The idols in them were deliberately broken into pieces. <br />The <br />  city was pillaged for 20 days, and a large number of buildings <br />were <br />  reduced to ashes." </p>

        <p>Chinese traveller and chronicler Chau Ju-kua, who travelled in the <br />Chola country c 1178 gives the following account of the Chola army:</p>
<p>This [Chola] country is at war with the kingdom of the [west] of <br />India. The government owns sixty thousand war elephants, every one <br />seven or eight feet high. When fighting these elephants carry on <br />their backs houses, and these houses are full of soldiers who shoot <br />arrows at long range, and fight with spears at close quarters.....we <br />were fighting among ourselves...despite the bitter experiances from <br />ghazni's invasions - our guys still didnt get the picture and were <br />fighting amoung themselves - with all this might we still lost <br />because of internal squables</p>

<p>  ====================</p>
<p>  Re RAJENDRA I :: Kalinga Tamil posted this earlier in May 2007 / <br />  edited / <br />  ===================<br />  Rajendra-Chola I. It may be noted that the appointment of<br />    members of the Chola family as viceroys of conquered territories<br />    started by this king was continued in the successive reigns[18].<br />    Between his 7th and 9th year Rajendra-Chola was engaged in <br />subduing<br />    the seven and a half lakhs country of Irattapadi. This was the<br />    country of the Western Chalukya kings ruled over at this time by<br />    Jayasimha II (A.D. 1018-1042). In his own inscriptions, Jayasimha<br />    claims to have defeated the Cholas. As both of them boast of <br />  having<br />    defeated each other, the fact ought to have been either that the<br />    success was on both sides alternately or that neither of the two<br />    obtained lasting advantage. Along with the Keralas he is stated <br />to<br />    have taken possession of the island of Sandimat. What this <br />island <br />  is,<br />    is not known.<br />    The inscriptions of his twelfth year mention a number of places, <br />  which<br />    do not appear in the list of conquests mentioned in the records <br />of <br />  his<br />    ninth year. During these three years, he must have carried on an<br />    extensive campaign. He is said to have taken Sakkarakottam,<br />    Maduramandalam, Namanaikkonam, Masunidesam and Panchappalli ; to <br />  have<br />    defeated a certain Indraratha of the lunar race at Adinagar and to<br />    have taken him and his family captive ; to have captured Odda-<br />  vishaya<br />    and Kosalai-nadu ; to have defeated Dharmapala and annexed <br />  Dandabutti<br />    ; to have subdued Ranasura of Takkana-Ladam ; to have overcome<br />    Govindachandra of Vangaladesa ; to have put to flight Mahipala <br />and <br />  to<br />    have taken Uttara-Ladam and the Ganga.<br />    Of the places mentioned here, it may be noted that Sakkarakottam <br />  has<br />    been identified by Rai Bahadur Hira Lal with Chakrakota, 8 miles<br />    distant from Rajapura in the Bastar State, which was under the <br />  rule of<br />    king Dharavarsha when Kulottunga I was the Chola sovereign. Dr.<br />    Hultzsch is of opinion that Maduramandalam is different from the<br />    Pandya country and that it must refer to the northern Mathura on <br />  the<br />    Yamuna river.[19] Here it may be noted that one of the kings of<br />    Rajapura called himself Madhurantakadeva perhaps on account of his<br />    capture of Madhura. It is not likely that he could have marched<br />    against Madhura of the south to earn this title. Consequently, <br />it <br />  is<br />    reasonable to suppose that Madhura or Maduramandalam was the name <br />  of a<br />    district not far from Chakrakota bordering on the Vengi country. <br />    Namanaikkonam, Panchapalli and Masunidesam have not yet been<br />    identified. Professor Kielhorn suggests that Indraratha of the <br />  lunar<br />    race captured by Rajendra-Chola at Adinagar may be identical with <br />  that<br />    Indraratha who is mentioned in the Udaipur inscription as an <br />enemy <br />  of<br />    Bhojadeva of Dhara. Odda-vishaya is the province of Orissa and<br />    Kosalai-nadu is southern Kosala. Dandabutti and its ruler <br />  Dharmapala<br />    are not known from any other sources. Mr. R. D. Banerji is of <br />  opinion<br />    that the Takkana-Ladam of the Tamil inscriptions is distinct both <br />  from<br />    Gujarat (Lata) and the territory of southern Berar (Virata), and <br />  that<br />    is should correspond to Dakshina-Radha a part of modern <br />Bengal.[20]<br />    Uttara-Ladam must, accordingly, denote the northern part of it. <br />    Mahipala whom the Chola king deprived of his elephants and women, <br />  is<br />    identified by Professor Kielhorn with the Pala king Mahipala I.<br />    Most of the places mentioned here were conquered by Rajendra-<br />Chola <br />  I<br />    in his campaign against the north for the purpose of bringing the<br />    sacred water of the Ganges, which earned for him the title<br />    Gangaikonda-Chola. The object of Rajendra-Chola in undertaking <br />  this<br />    campaign is referred to in the Tiruvalangadu grant thus[21] : -<br />    "This light of the solar race, laughing at Bhagiratha who had <br />  brought<br />    down the Ganges to the earth from heaven by the power of his<br />    austerities, wished to sanctify his own country with the water of <br />  the<br />    Ganges. Accordingly, he ordered the commander of the army, who <br />had<br />    powerful battalions under his control, who was the resort of <br />  heroism<br />    and the foremost of diplomats, to subdue the enemy kings <br />occupying <br />  the<br />    countries on the banks of that river."<br />    The conquest of Northern India by the Cholas must have taken <br />place <br />  in<br />    1023 A.D. the above account shows that it was a general of the <br />  Chola<br />    king who conducted his campaign. But it is somewhat difficult to<br />    believe how a single Chola army could overrun within one year <br />such <br />  a<br />    vast tract of country. It is also said that after vanquishing the<br />    kings of the Gangetic countries Rajendra-Chola's general caused <br />the<br />    water of the sacred river to be brought to the Chola capital on <br />the<br />    heads of the conquered kings[22]. A stone record of the king <br />  found<br />    at Ennayiram in the South Arcot district contains interesting<br />    information regarding the conquest of the northern region by the <br />  king<br />    himself, of his stately return march with all the splendour of the<br />    conqueror, of his wedding the Ganga and hence assuming the title<br />    Gangaikonda-Chola and building a hall called after the title at<br />    Ennayiram and feeding a number of people in it. The wording of <br />the<br />    inscription seems to indicate that Rajendra-Chola I was himself<br />    engaged in the expedition against the kings of Northern India<br />    (Uttarapatha) and if may not be unreasonable to suppose that he <br />did<br />    not entrust the management of it merely to his generals as the <br />  wording<br />    of the Tiruvalangadu plates at first sight would imply[23].  <br />Though<br />    the date of the record is effaced, the conquests enumerated in it <br />  show<br />    that it cannot be earlier than A.D. 1023. It interesting to note <br />  that<br />    charities which it registers for the maintenance of a hostel and a<br />    college for religious instruction of every description, were made <br />  to<br />    secure success to the arms of the king, showing clearly that the <br />  king<br />    was at the time engaged in the war. It must have been during this<br />    northern invasion that Rajendra-Chola had the lords of the Kuluta <br />  and<br />    the Utkala countries slain by his generals as reported in the<br />    Kanyakumari inscription[24]. The encounter with the Kuluta king <br />is<br />    also referred to in an inscription of the king found at <br />  Mahendragiri<br />    where he is said to haveset up a pillar of victory. The <br />Kanyakumar<br />    inscription adds Kalinga to the list of the king's conquests.  <br />  After<br />    this invasion of northern India there seems to have been <br />  considerable<br />    communication between the kings of northern India and the Chola<br />    country. During the reign of Rajadhiraja I, the son and <br />successor <br />  of<br />    Rajendra-Chola I, the title "Protector of the people of <br />  Kannakuchchi"<br />    (Kanyakubja, i.e., Kanauj) was bestowed on one of the royal <br />  princes. <br />    This shows that Kanauj had close relations with the Cholas. In an<br />    inscription of Kulottunga I found at Gangaikondacholapuram, the <br />  usual<br />    introduction of the inscriptions of Gahadavala king <br />  Govindarachandra<br />    occurs after the name of the Chola king. As the prasasti of the<br />    gahadavala king was put in after the name of Kulotunga I, it <br />seems <br />  as<br />    if the Cholas had some sort of suzerainty over that northern <br />power.<br />    In commemoration of this memorable campaign in which the waters <br />of <br />  the<br />    Ganga were carried on the heads of the subdued kings, the Chola <br />  king<br />    founded a new city, which he called Gangaikondacholapuram. In <br />this<br />    city, Rajendra-Chola built a great temple on the model of the<br />    Rajarajesvara temple at Tanjore, built by his father. This city <br />  was<br />    the capital of Chola emperors for about 100 years. Its original <br />  name<br />    seems to have been Mudikondacholapuram, after another surname of <br />  the<br />    king, and afterwards changed into that of Gangaikondacholapuram.  <br />  It<br />    had also the name Gangapuri.<br />    Great as were the military achievements of Rajendra-Chola I in the<br />    mainland of India, he acquired even greater fame by his navel<br />    engagements, which took place on the other side of the Bay of <br />  Bengal,<br />    a feat not attempted by any sovereign of India till his time. It <br />  is<br />    said that he dispatched many ships in the midst of the rolling <br />sea,<br />    captured Samgramavijajotungavarman, the king of Kadaram, along <br />with<br />    his vehicles and accumulated treasure, took Sri-Vishaya, Pannai,<br />    Malaiyur, Mayirudingam, Ilangasokam, Mappappalam, Mevilimbangam,<br />    Valaippanduru, Takkolam, Madamalingam, Ilamuridesam, Nakkavaram <br />and<br />    Kadram. Samgramavijayottungavarman, the king against whom this <br />war<br />    was waged with great advantage of the Cholas was probably a <br />  successor<br />    fo Maravijayaottungavarman of the Sailendravamsa, the lord of<br />    Sri-Vishaya, who while extending the kingdom of Kataha, is <br />  reported in<br />    the Leyden plates to have built a lofty and beautiful monastery at<br />    Nagapattanam and called it Chudamanivarma-vihara, after the name <br />of<br />    his father Chudamanivarman. Since it is stated in the plates that<br />    both Rajaraja I and Rajendra-Chola I patronized the vihara, it <br />  appears<br />    that Samgramavijayaottungavarman, proving refractory, Rajendra-<br />  Chola<br />    had to take the extreme step of conquering the whole of his <br />  kingdom ?<br />    in which must have been included all the places mentioned above ? <br />  and<br />    depriving him of his wealth. It is also learnt that Rajendra-<br />Chola<br />    (Shih-li-li-cha-yin-lo-lo-chu-lo) sent an embassy to China, <br />though <br />  we<br />    do not know what his intentions were in that direction[25].<br />    Among the places mentioned in the final campaign of the king,<br />    Sri-Vishaya or Sri-Vijaya has been taken to be the same as San-fo-<br />  tsai<br />    of the Chinese annals and identified by Mr. George Coedes with the<br />    residency of Palambang in Sumatra ; Nakkavaram and Pappalam stand<br />    respectively for the Nicobar islands and a port of that name in <br />  Burma<br />    ; Takkolam has been identified with Takopa on the western part of <br />  the<br />    Malay Peninsula and Kadaram is located in lower Burma. Rest of <br />the<br />    places are not known.<br />    We shall here notice a few facts concerning the relations of<br />    Rajendra-Chola I. Kundavai, the eldest sister of his father <br />  married a<br />    chief named Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar, who figures as a feudatory <br />  in<br />    some of the inscriptions of Rajendra-Chola I. The king's sister, <br />  the<br />    younger Kundavai, was married to the Eastern Chalukya Vimaladitya <br />  and<br />    this prince was in the Chola dominions for some time, though the<br />    object of his mission is not known. Rajendra-Chola had several<br />    queens. One of them was Panchavanmahadevi ; another was<br />    Danti-Pirattiyar[26] and a third Viramahadevi. Of the last, an<br />    inscription of Rajadhiraja states that she entered the supreme <br />  feet of<br />    Brahma (i.e., died) in the very year of demise of Rajendra-Chola <br />I<br />    and was buried in the very tomb of that king[27]. This tomb in <br />  which<br />    the bodies of the two royal personages were deposited might <br />  possibly<br />    have been at Brahmadesam in the North Arcot district. As the <br />  record<br />    is dated in the 26th year of the reign of Rajadhiraja, it is <br />  inferred<br />    that, Rajendra-Chola died in that year, i.e., A.D. 1044 and that <br />  his<br />    queen Viramahadevi committed sati and was buried with him[28].  <br />The<br />    Kanyakumari inscription settles the relationship of Rajendra-<br />Chola <br />  I<br />    and his successors Rajadhiraja, Rajendradeva and Vira-Rajendra.  <br />It<br />    states that like unto the three fires of a sacrifice there were <br />  born<br />    to Rajendra-Chola I three sons of whom the first was Rajadhiraja <br />  and<br />    that Rajendradeva and Vira-Rajaendra were his younger brothers<br />  [29]. <br />    Ammanga was the name of his daughter who married the Eastern <br />  Chalukya<br />    king Rajaraja I : their son was Kulottunga I.<br />    King Rajendra-Chola I struck coins in his own name. They are <br />  referred<br />    to in his inscriptions under the names Rajendrasolan-kasu and<br />    Madurantakadevan-Madai. Besides these, Rajarajan-kasu issued in <br />  the<br />    time of Rajaraja I was also current in his time[30].<br />    Of the literary activity displayed in the Chola country during the<br />    period of rajendra Chola's rule, we know very little. Saiva <br />works <br />  of<br />    the type of Siddhantasaravali must have been largely written and<br />    patronized by the king who was himself a devout Saiva. Jaina and<br />    Buddhist literature also had its share of royal patronage. From <br />  the<br />    Upasakajanalankara of the Mahathera Ananda, a manuscript of which <br />  has<br />    been reviewed by Dr. Barnett in the Journal of the Royal Asiactic<br />    Society for January 1901, pp. 87 to 90, it may be inferred that <br />  the<br />    king lent his patronage to Buddhist literature. Dr. Barnett <br />  thought<br />    that the Chola-Ganga mentioned in the Upasakajanalankara was <br />  identical<br />    with Anantavarman Chodaganga. This could not be, for, in the <br />first<br />    place, the latter is not a Chola but an Eastern Ganga king who <br />  ruled<br />    at Kalinganagara which has been identified with Mukhalingam in the<br />    Parlakimedi estate, Ganjam district. Pandubhumandala is stated <br />to <br />  be<br />    the country where Chola-Ganga was ruling as a samanta (a <br />  subordinate<br />    ruler) perhaps as the viceroy of his father. This fact makes the<br />    chances of his identity with Anantavarman Chodaganga very<br />    problematical. Consequently, a different identification has to be<br />    sought for. The king mentioned is in my opinion the famous Chola<br />    emperor Rajendra-Chola I who was also called Gangaikonda-Chola on<br />    account of his having subdued the country about Gangai, i.e., the<br />    Ganges. His conquests, as we know, were many and spread <br />  practically<br />    over the whole of India and extended even to Ceylon. The<br />    Tiruvalangadu grant clearly states that Rajendra-Chola I, also <br />  called<br />    Madhurantaka, took possession of the wealth of the Pandya king, <br />  placed<br />    there his own son Chola-Pandy for the protection of the Pandya<br />    country, and that he constructed in his capital the tank called<br />    Cholagangam evidently so named after one of his own titles. This <br />  last<br />    fact decisively proves the identity of the king mentioned in the<br />    Upasakajanalankara with king Rajendra-Chola I. The name<br />    Gunakara-Perumpalli which the king is stated to have given to one <br />  of<br />    the three viharas which he founded in Ceylon also clearly <br />indicates<br />    that the builder was a Tamil king.<br />    Rajendra-Chola I succeeded to the throne in A.D. 1012 and ruled <br />  till<br />    at least A.D. 1044. His position as a samanta in the Pandya <br />  country<br />    must have been during the early years of his heir-apparently <br />prior <br />  to<br />    A.D. 1012. The identification of Cholaganga with Rajendra-Chola <br />  will<br />    thus alter the dates and the identification of the Mahathera <br />  Ananda,<br />    the author of Upasakajanalankara.<br />    In addition to the surnames Gangaikonda-Chola, Mudigonda-Chola and<br />    Cholaganga, which have been noticed above, Rajendra-Chola also <br />had <br />  the<br />    surnames Madurantaka, Nigarili-Chola and Pandita-Chola. The last <br />  name<br />    shows that he must have been considered a scholar in Sanskrit.  <br />It <br />  is<br />    also stated in the Siddhantasaravali of Trilochanasivacharya that<br />    Rajendra-Chola on the occasion of his visit to the Ganges saw <br />there<br />    the best of the Saivas and brought them with him and settled them <br />  at<br />    Kanchi and other places in the Chola country. Information about<br />    Rajadhiraja and his successors could be gathered from the <br />elaborate<br />    introductions to their inscriptions given by Prof. Hultzsch in <br />  parts<br />    I. II and III.<br />    [1] Below pp. 246 ff.<br />    [2] This title suggests that Sundara-Chola's actual predecessor <br />or<br />    elected predecessor must have been a Parakesarivarman, and<br />    Uttama-Chola, the son of Gandaraditya, bore this surname but may <br />  have<br />    been too young at the time to succeed his father.<br />    [3] Ep. Ind., Vol. XII, pp. 121 ff.<br />    [4] This is a Sanskritized form of the Tamil word Valavan which <br />is<br />    synonymous with the word Chola.<br />    [5] J.R.A.S., 1913, pp. 517.<br />    [6] Ep. Ind., Vol. XV, pp. 44 to 72.<br />    [7] Another queen mentioned in inscriptions was<br />    Parantakandevi-Ammanar, the daughter of a Chera king.<br />    [8] The adoption of the title Rajakesarivarman could be <br />explained <br />  by<br />    saying that the claims of Gandaraditya's chosen successor, viz., <br />  his<br />    son Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola were temporarily set aside and<br />    postponed.<br />    [9] No. 122, dated in the 14th year of Rajakesarivarman has been<br />    attributed to Sundara-Chola Parantaka II, but may more probably <br />  belong<br />    to the reign of Rajaraja.<br />    [10] See below, p. 420 V. 68.<br />    [11] Loc.

<p>    After reading through KAN 'Colas' I am somehow convinced that we <br />  have given short change to the Chola kings who followed RJC. While <br />  RRC/RJC may be the greatest of Cholas, I strongly doubt whether RJC <br />  may have been able to maintain an empire without the aid of <br />  Rajadhiraja. Rajadhiraja, to me atleast, seems a great warrior king <br />  in the moulds of greate empire builders across the world. When I <br />  read about the battle of Koppam, the heroics of Rajadhiraja and <br />  Rajendra II shows that they are the Cholas without whom the <br />  line/empire would have perished then and there. Just the number of <br />  battles he has fought during RJCs lifetime and his own kingship <br />  attest to the problems of a great empire and I strongly doubt even <br />  under the most favorable scenario, it would've been possible for <br />  Cholas to stop the moghal invasion. After all, they couldn't subdue <br />  the W.Chalukyas even after all the fighting and the rise of the <br />  Hoysalas. My reasoning being while the entire N.India from <br />Rajasthan <br />  to Bihar can be looked on as a single entity in terms of language <br />  and culture and therefore, easier to conquer militarily and keep it <br />  at peace by a benign soverign (as is the case from Ashoka to Harsha <br />  to Akbar) whereas the deccan had too many entities (telugus, <br />  kannadigas, kerals) who identified themselves as seperate nations. <br />  This single factor bodes ill for any empire that sprang from the <br />  south and is true for the Cholas as well as the Vijayanagar empire <br />a <br />  half century later. But after all, we are talking about a 'What <br />  might have been' scenario and we can as well state that the Cholas <br />  might have been the dynasty which reversed the invasion route and <br />  invaded the persian empire itself!Muthu Prakash R--- In <br />  <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Rajendhra Cholan!" <br />  <rajendhracholan@  wrote:   But, RjC indeed fight agaist Gazni, in <br />  his way back to GKC after   vanquishing Pala's and Kosala's.    <br />  Creating something is tough, but sustaining it is more tough, thats <br />    where all kingdoms, went down.

<p>====================</p>
<p>Re RAJENDRA I :: Kalinga Tamil posted this earlier in May 2007 / <br />edited / <br />===================<br />Rajendra-Chola I. It may be noted that the appointment of</p>
<blockquote><p>  members of the Chola family as viceroys of conquered territories<br />  started by this king was continued in the successive reigns[18].<br />  Between his 7th and 9th year Rajendra-Chola was engaged in subduing<br />  the seven and a half lakhs country of Irattapadi. This was the<br />  country of the Western Chalukya kings ruled over at this time by<br />  Jayasimha II (A.D. 1018-1042). In his own inscriptions, Jayasimha<br />  claims to have defeated the Cholas. As both of them boast of <br />having<br />  defeated each other, the fact ought to have been either that the<br />  success was on both sides alternately or that neither of the two<br />  obtained lasting advantage. Along with the Keralas he is stated to<br />  have taken possession of the island of Sandimat. What this island <br />is,<br />  is not known.<br />  The inscriptions of his twelfth year mention a number of places, <br />which<br />  do not appear in the list of conquests mentioned in the records of <br />his<br />  ninth year. During these three years, he must have carried on an<br />  extensive campaign. He is said to have taken Sakkarakottam,<br />  Maduramandalam, Namanaikkonam, Masunidesam and Panchappalli ; to <br />have<br />  defeated a certain Indraratha of the lunar race at Adinagar and to<br />  have taken him and his family captive ; to have captured Odda-<br />vishaya<br />  and Kosalai-nadu ; to have defeated Dharmapala and annexed <br />Dandabutti<br />  ; to have subdued Ranasura of Takkana-Ladam ; to have overcome<br />  Govindachandra of Vangaladesa ; to have put to flight Mahipala and <br />to<br />  have taken Uttara-Ladam and the Ganga.<br />  Of the places mentioned here, it may be noted that Sakkarakottam <br />has<br />  been identified by Rai Bahadur Hira Lal with Chakrakota, 8 miles<br />  distant from Rajapura in the Bastar State, which was under the <br />rule of<br />  king Dharavarsha when Kulottunga I was the Chola sovereign. Dr.<br />  Hultzsch is of opinion that Maduramandalam is different from the<br />  Pandya country and that it must refer to the northern Mathura on <br />the<br />  Yamuna river.[19] Here it may be noted that one of the kings of<br />  Rajapura called himself Madhurantakadeva perhaps on account of his<br />  capture of Madhura. It is not likely that he could have marched<br />  against Madhura of the south to earn this title. Consequently, it <br />is<br />  reasonable to suppose that Madhura or Maduramandalam was the name <br />of a<br />  district not far from Chakrakota bordering on the Vengi country. <br />  Namanaikkonam, Panchapalli and Masunidesam have not yet been<br />  identified. Professor Kielhorn suggests that Indraratha of the <br />lunar<br />  race captured by Rajendra-Chola at Adinagar may be identical with <br />that<br />  Indraratha who is mentioned in the Udaipur inscription as an enemy <br />of<br />  Bhojadeva of Dhara. Odda-vishaya is the province of Orissa and<br />  Kosalai-nadu is southern Kosala. Dandabutti and its ruler <br />Dharmapala<br />  are not known from any other sources. Mr. R. D. Banerji is of <br />opinion<br />  that the Takkana-Ladam of the Tamil inscriptions is distinct both <br />from<br />  Gujarat (Lata) and the territory of southern Berar (Virata), and <br />that<br />  is should correspond to Dakshina-Radha a part of modern Bengal.[20]<br />  Uttara-Ladam must, accordingly, denote the northern part of it. <br />  Mahipala whom the Chola king deprived of his elephants and women, <br />is<br />  identified by Professor Kielhorn with the Pala king Mahipala I.<br />  Most of the places mentioned here were conquered by Rajendra-Chola <br />I<br />  in his campaign against the north for the purpose of bringing the<br />  sacred water of the Ganges, which earned for him the title<br />  Gangaikonda-Chola. The object of Rajendra-Chola in undertaking <br />this<br />  campaign is referred to in the Tiruvalangadu grant thus[21] : -<br />  "This light of the solar race, laughing at Bhagiratha who had <br />brought<br />  down the Ganges to the earth from heaven by the power of his<br />  austerities, wished to sanctify his own country with the water of <br />the<br />  Ganges. Accordingly, he ordered the commander of the army, who had<br />  powerful battalions under his control, who was the resort of <br />heroism<br />  and the foremost of diplomats, to subdue the enemy kings occupying <br />the<br />  countries on the banks of that river."<br />  The conquest of Northern India by the Cholas must have taken place <br />in<br />  1023 A.D. the above account shows that it was a general of the <br />Chola<br />  king who conducted his campaign. But it is somewhat difficult to<br />  believe how a single Chola army could overrun within one year such <br />a<br />  vast tract of country. It is also said that after vanquishing the<br />  kings of the Gangetic countries Rajendra-Chola's general caused the<br />  water of the sacred river to be brought to the Chola capital on the<br />  heads of the conquered kings[22]. A stone record of the king <br />found<br />  at Ennayiram in the South Arcot district contains interesting<br />  information regarding the conquest of the northern region by the <br />king<br />  himself, of his stately return march with all the splendour of the<br />  conqueror, of his wedding the Ganga and hence assuming the title<br />  Gangaikonda-Chola and building a hall called after the title at<br />  Ennayiram and feeding a number of people in it. The wording of the<br />  inscription seems to indicate that Rajendra-Chola I was himself<br />  engaged in the expedition against the kings of Northern India<br />  (Uttarapatha) and if may not be unreasonable to suppose that he did<br />  not entrust the management of it merely to his generals as the <br />wording<br />  of the Tiruvalangadu plates at first sight would imply[23]. Though<br />  the date of the record is effaced, the conquests enumerated in it <br />show<br />  that it cannot be earlier than A.D. 1023. It interesting to note <br />that<br />  charities which it registers for the maintenance of a hostel and a<br />  college for religious instruction of every description, were made <br />to<br />  secure success to the arms of the king, showing clearly that the <br />king<br />  was at the time engaged in the war. It must have been during this<br />  northern invasion that Rajendra-Chola had the lords of the Kuluta <br />and<br />  the Utkala countries slain by his generals as reported in the<br />  Kanyakumari inscription[24]. The encounter with the Kuluta king is<br />  also referred to in an inscription of the king found at <br />Mahendragiri<br />  where he is said to haveset up a pillar of victory. The Kanyakumar<br />  inscription adds Kalinga to the list of the king's conquests.  <br />After<br />  this invasion of northern India there seems to have been <br />considerable<br />  communication between the kings of northern India and the Chola<br />  country. During the reign of Rajadhiraja I, the son and successor <br />of<br />  Rajendra-Chola I, the title "Protector of the people of <br />Kannakuchchi"<br />  (Kanyakubja, i.e., Kanauj) was bestowed on one of the royal <br />princes. <br />  This shows that Kanauj had close relations with the Cholas. In an<br />  inscription of Kulottunga I found at Gangaikondacholapuram, the <br />usual<br />  introduction of the inscriptions of Gahadavala king <br />Govindarachandra<br />  occurs after the name of the Chola king. As the prasasti of the<br />  gahadavala king was put in after the name of Kulotunga I, it seems <br />as<br />  if the Cholas had some sort of suzerainty over that northern power.<br />  In commemoration of this memorable campaign in which the waters of <br />the<br />  Ganga were carried on the heads of the subdued kings, the Chola <br />king<br />  founded a new city, which he called Gangaikondacholapuram. In this<br />  city, Rajendra-Chola built a great temple on the model of the<br />  Rajarajesvara temple at Tanjore, built by his father. This city <br />was<br />  the capital of Chola emperors for about 100 years. Its original <br />name<br />  seems to have been Mudikondacholapuram, after another surname of <br />the<br />  king, and afterwards changed into that of Gangaikondacholapuram.  <br />It<br />  had also the name Gangapuri.<br />  Great as were the military achievements of Rajendra-Chola I in the<br />  mainland of India, he acquired even greater fame by his navel<br />  engagements, which took place on the other side of the Bay of <br />Bengal,<br />  a feat not attempted by any sovereign of India till his time. It <br />is<br />  said that he dispatched many ships in the midst of the rolling sea,<br />  captured Samgramavijajotungavarman, the king of Kadaram, along with<br />  his vehicles and accumulated treasure, took Sri-Vishaya, Pannai,<br />  Malaiyur, Mayirudingam, Ilangasokam, Mappappalam, Mevilimbangam,<br />  Valaippanduru, Takkolam, Madamalingam, Ilamuridesam, Nakkavaram and<br />  Kadram. Samgramavijayottungavarman, the king against whom this war<br />  was waged with great advantage of the Cholas was probably a <br />successor<br />  fo Maravijayaottungavarman of the Sailendravamsa, the lord of<br />  Sri-Vishaya, who while extending the kingdom of Kataha, is <br />reported in<br />  the Leyden plates to have built a lofty and beautiful monastery at<br />  Nagapattanam and called it Chudamanivarma-vihara, after the name of<br />  his father Chudamanivarman. Since it is stated in the plates that<br />  both Rajaraja I and Rajendra-Chola I patronized the vihara, it <br />appears<br />  that Samgramavijayaottungavarman, proving refractory, Rajendra-<br />Chola<br />  had to take the extreme step of conquering the whole of his <br />kingdom ?<br />  in which must have been included all the places mentioned above ? <br />and<br />  depriving him of his wealth. It is also learnt that Rajendra-Chola<br />  (Shih-li-li-cha-yin-lo-lo-chu-lo) sent an embassy to China, though <br />we<br />  do not know what his intentions were in that direction[25].<br />  Among the places mentioned in the final campaign of the king,<br />  Sri-Vishaya or Sri-Vijaya has been taken to be the same as San-fo-<br />tsai<br />  of the Chinese annals and identified by Mr. George Coedes with the<br />  residency of Palambang in Sumatra ; Nakkavaram and Pappalam stand<br />  respectively for the Nicobar islands and a port of that name in <br />Burma<br />  ; Takkolam has been identified with Takopa on the western part of <br />the<br />  Malay Peninsula and Kadaram is located in lower Burma. Rest of the<br />  places are not known.<br />  We shall here notice a few facts concerning the relations of<br />  Rajendra-Chola I. Kundavai, the eldest sister of his father <br />married a<br />  chief named Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar, who figures as a feudatory <br />in<br />  some of the inscriptions of Rajendra-Chola I. The king's sister, <br />the<br />  younger Kundavai, was married to the Eastern Chalukya Vimaladitya <br />and<br />  this prince was in the Chola dominions for some time, though the<br />  object of his mission is not known. Rajendra-Chola had several<br />  queens. One of them was Panchavanmahadevi ; another was<br />  Danti-Pirattiyar[26] and a third Viramahadevi. Of the last, an<br />  inscription of Rajadhiraja states that she entered the supreme <br />feet of<br />  Brahma (i.e., died) in the very year of demise of Rajendra-Chola I<br />  and was buried in the very tomb of that king[27]. This tomb in <br />which<br />  the bodies of the two royal personages were deposited might <br />possibly<br />  have been at Brahmadesam in the North Arcot district. As the <br />record<br />  is dated in the 26th year of the reign of Rajadhiraja, it is <br />inferred<br />  that, Rajendra-Chola died in that year, i.e., A.D. 1044 and that <br />his<br />  queen Viramahadevi committed sati and was buried with him[28]. The<br />  Kanyakumari inscription settles the relationship of Rajendra-Chola <br />I<br />  and his successors Rajadhiraja, Rajendradeva and Vira-Rajendra. It<br />  states that like unto the three fires of a sacrifice there were <br />born<br />  to Rajendra-Chola I three sons of whom the first was Rajadhiraja <br />and<br />  that Rajendradeva and Vira-Rajaendra were his younger brothers<br />[29]. <br />  Ammanga was the name of his daughter who married the Eastern <br />Chalukya<br />  king Rajaraja I : their son was Kulottunga I.<br />  King Rajendra-Chola I struck coins in his own name. They are <br />referred<br />  to in his inscriptions under the names Rajendrasolan-kasu and<br />  Madurantakadevan-Madai. Besides these, Rajarajan-kasu issued in <br />the<br />  time of Rajaraja I was also current in his time[30].<br />  Of the literary activity displayed in the Chola country during the<br />  period of rajendra Chola's rule, we know very little. Saiva works <br />of<br />  the type of Siddhantasaravali must have been largely written and<br />  patronized by the king who was himself a devout Saiva. Jaina and<br />  Buddhist literature also had its share of royal patronage. From <br />the<br />  Upasakajanalankara of the Mahathera Ananda, a manuscript of which <br />has<br />  been reviewed by Dr. Barnett in the Journal of the Royal Asiactic<br />  Society for January 1901, pp. 87 to 90, it may be inferred that <br />the<br />  king lent his patronage to Buddhist literature. Dr. Barnett <br />thought<br />  that the Chola-Ganga mentioned in the Upasakajanalankara was <br />identical<br />  with Anantavarman Chodaganga. This could not be, for, in the first<br />  place, the latter is not a Chola but an Eastern Ganga king who <br />ruled<br />  at Kalinganagara which has been identified with Mukhalingam in the<br />  Parlakimedi estate, Ganjam district. Pandubhumandala is stated to <br />be<br />  the country where Chola-Ganga was ruling as a samanta (a <br />subordinate<br />  ruler) perhaps as the viceroy of his father. This fact makes the<br />  chances of his identity with Anantavarman Chodaganga very<br />  problematical. Consequently, a different identification has to be<br />  sought for. The king mentioned is in my opinion the famous Chola<br />  emperor Rajendra-Chola I who was also called Gangaikonda-Chola on<br />  account of his having subdued the country about Gangai, i.e., the<br />  Ganges. His conquests, as we know, were many and spread <br />practically<br />  over the whole of India and extended even to Ceylon. The<br />  Tiruvalangadu grant clearly states that Rajendra-Chola I, also <br />called<br />  Madhurantaka, took possession of the wealth of the Pandya king, <br />placed<br />  there his own son Chola-Pandy for the protection of the Pandya<br />  country, and that he constructed in his capital the tank called<br />  Cholagangam evidently so named after one of his own titles. This <br />last<br />  fact decisively proves the identity of the king mentioned in the<br />  Upasakajanalankara with king Rajendra-Chola I. The name<br />  Gunakara-Perumpalli which the king is stated to have given to one <br />of<br />  the three viharas which he founded in Ceylon also clearly indicates<br />  that the builder was a Tamil king.<br />  Rajendra-Chola I succeeded to the throne in A.D. 1012 and ruled <br />till<br />  at least A.D. 1044. His position as a samanta in the Pandya <br />country<br />  must have been during the early years of his heir-apparently prior <br />to<br />  A.D. 1012. The identification of Cholaganga with Rajendra-Chola <br />will<br />  thus alter the dates and the identification of the Mahathera <br />Ananda,<br />  the author of Upasakajanalankara.<br />  In addition to the surnames Gangaikonda-Chola, Mudigonda-Chola and<br />  Cholaganga, which have been noticed above, Rajendra-Chola also had <br />the<br />  surnames Madurantaka, Nigarili-Chola and Pandita-Chola. The last <br />name<br />  shows that he must have been considered a scholar in Sanskrit. It <br />is<br />  also stated in the Siddhantasaravali of Trilochanasivacharya that<br />  Rajendra-Chola on the occasion of his visit to the Ganges saw there<br />  the best of the Saivas and brought them with him and settled them <br />at<br />  Kanchi and other places in the Chola country. Information about<br />  Rajadhiraja and his successors could be gathered from the elaborate<br />  introductions to their inscriptions given by Prof. Hultzsch in <br />parts<br />  I. II and III.<br />  [1] Below pp. 246 ff.<br />  [2] This title suggests that Sundara-Chola's actual predecessor or<br />  elected predecessor must have been a Parakesarivarman, and<br />  Uttama-Chola, the son of Gandaraditya, bore this surname but may <br />have<br />  been too young at the time to succeed his father.<br />  [3] Ep. Ind., Vol. XII, pp. 121 ff.<br />  [4] This is a Sanskritized form of the Tamil word Valavan which is<br />  synonymous with the word Chola.<br />  [5] J.R.A.S., 1913, pp. 517.<br />  [6] Ep. Ind., Vol. XV, pp. 44 to 72.<br />  [7] Another queen mentioned in inscriptions was<br />  Parantakandevi-Ammanar, the daughter of a Chera king.<br />  [8] The adoption of the title Rajakesarivarman could be explained <br />by<br />  saying that the claims of Gandaraditya's chosen successor, viz., <br />his<br />  son Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola were temporarily set aside and<br />  postponed.<br />  [9] No. 122, dated in the 14th year of Rajakesarivarman has been<br />  attributed to Sundara-Chola Parantaka II, but may more probably <br />belong<br />  to the reign of Rajaraja.<br />  [10] See below, p. 420 V. 68.<br />  [11] Loc.

<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym /RJC may be the greatest of Cholas, I strongly doubt whether <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  <br />may have been able to maintain an empire without the aid of <br />Rajadhiraja. Rajadhiraja, to me atleast, seems a great warrior king <br />in the moulds of greate empire builders across the world. When I <br />read about the battle of Koppam, the heroics of Rajadhiraja and <br />Rajendra II shows that they are the Cholas without whom the <br />line/empire would have perished then and there. Just the number of <br />battles he has fought during RJCs lifetime and his own kingship <br />attest to the problems of a great empire and I strongly doubt even <br />under the most favorable scenario, it would've been possible for <br />Cholas to stop the moghal invasion. After all, they couldn't subdue <br />the W.Chalukyas even after all the fighting and the rise of the <br />Hoysalas. My reasoning being while the entire N.India from Rajasthan <br />to Bihar can be looked on as a single entity in terms of language <br />and culture and therefore, easier to conquer militarily and keep it <br />at peace by a benign soverign (as is the case from Ashoka to Harsha <br />to Akbar) whereas the deccan had too many entities (telugus, <br />kannadigas, kerals) who identified themselves as seperate nations. <br />This single factor bodes ill for any empire that sprang from the <br />south and is true for the Cholas as well as the Vijayanagar empire a <br />half century later. But after all, we are talking about a 'What <br />might have been' scenario and we can as well state that the Cholas <br />might have been the dynasty which reversed the invasion route and <br />invaded the persian empire itself!Muthu Prakash R--- In <br /><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Rajendhra Cholan!" <br /><rajendhracholan@  wrote:   But, RjC indeed fight agaist Gazni, in <br />his way back to GKC after   vanquishing Pala's and Kosala's.    <br />Creating something is tough, but sustaining it is more tough, thats </rajendhracholan@></acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  Very true...every system tends towards instability. Nothing is <br />more <br />  permanent than change itself - it would call for great flair and <br />  governance to keep together a kingdom of such size and complexity. <br />  We are talking of kings holding together people under their rule <br />for <br />  century's together...On the flip side - imagine the power and <br />  absolute power at that..no wonder the princes were tutored by <br />  eminent gurus and kings advised by illustrious ministers to let <br />them <br />  not stray from the right path - when democratic governments cannot <br />  deliver theirs and people lose faith within even their elected <br />  terms..</p>
<p>  the need for a king - as advised by the great beeshma:</p>
<p>  "Beeshma said: ?Neither kingship nor<br />  king was there in the beginning, neither<br />  scepter nor the bearer of the scepter. All<br />  people protected one another another by means of<br />  righteous conduct (dharma). Thus, while<br />  protecting one another by means of righteous<br />  conduct, O Bharata, men eventually<br />  fell into a state of spiritual lassitude<br />  [weariness]. Then delusion overcame<br />  them? their sense of righteous conduct<br />  was lost. When understanding was lost,<br />  all men? became victims of greed."</p>
<p>  Later the god Vishnu chooses "? that one person among mortals who<br />  alone is worthy of high eminence." A man named Virajas is brought<br />  forth and he becomes the first king.</p>

        <p>Very true...every system tends towards instability. Nothing is more <br />permanent than change itself - it would call for great flair and <br />governance to keep together a kingdom of such size and complexity. <br />We are talking of kings holding together people under their rule for <br />century's together...On the flip side - imagine the power and <br />absolute power at that..no wonder the princes were tutored by <br />eminent gurus and kings advised by illustrious ministers to let them <br />not stray from the right path - when democratic governments cannot <br />deliver theirs and people lose faith within even their elected <br />terms..</p>
<p>the need for a king - as advised by the great beeshma:</p>
<p>"Beeshma said: ?Neither kingship nor<br />king was there in the beginning, neither<br />scepter nor the bearer of the scepter. All<br />people protected one another another by means of<br />righteous conduct (dharma). Thus, while<br />protecting one another by means of righteous<br />conduct, O Bharata, men eventually<br />fell into a state of spiritual lassitude<br />[weariness]. Then delusion overcame<br />them? their sense of righteous conduct<br />was lost. When understanding was lost,<br />all men? became victims of greed."</p>
<p>Later the god Vishnu chooses "? that one person among mortals who<br />alone is worthy of high eminence." A man named Virajas is brought<br />forth and he becomes the first king.</p>

<p>Creating something is tough, but sustaining it is more tough, thats <br />where all kingdoms, went down. Name it, Cholas, Cheras, or Pandyas. <br />This needs Valour, values and genius. Cholas lacked valour in Raja <br />Raja III, which proved fatal. Veera Pandian and his brother lacked <br />ingenuity, as they invited the terror on to themselves and the great <br />tamil nation, which was disasterous. </p>
