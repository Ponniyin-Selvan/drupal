</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Vijay!<br />the post has gone to our Sundar Krishnan's but the subject is KDR, is it not?. So, I reverted to KDR again.<br /> <br />It is right to assume that KDR did not have any son. So it has to gone to Atchutha Rayan, his brother (younger) in 1529. Then his Alludu Ramaraju cameto power in 1542, then the destruction starts for Vijayanagara. 1565, everything gone, and Ramaraju was killed at the war at the age of around 80.<br /> <br />But if studying deeply about the Vijayanagara empire, you can understand that no single race has ruled the kingdom continuously from the starting period of 1350 or so. KDR was named as 'Tuluva race' and he puts his 'initial' or family name as Tuluva Krishna Dheva Raya, and the he was the first king for this race. before him the brahmin Chellappah Saluva Nayaga or Narsinga or Narasimhan of Chandragiri fort was ruling from the both Hampi and Chandragiri (near Tirupati - if you come from Bangalore to Tirupati, you canstill see this fort), and Bukka (1344) who started this empire with the help of Saint Vidhyadhara, belongs to Salukya or related race. St. Vidhyadhara' story itself very interesting and the 'Vassthu sasthra' plays a very big game in establishing vijayanagara empire.<br /> <br />Important fact that Narasimha/Chellappa or Saluva Chellappa Nayagar  groomed KDR since childhood, according to Sewell, who was the ICS English Officer under whom our great historical scholars like Krishnaswamy Iyengar worked in Madras University. Sewell publications which was released in1900, found that the Srivilli Aandal Temple was constructed during Chellappa Nayaga's period (1490 to 1509). Burton Stein the living legend of Cambridge University, quotes this incident in his book'Vijayanagara' that when Chellapa went to deep south near Villiputhur, thde temple was so old in depleted condition, and a small and beutiful girl called him and took him insideto the temple and vanished. Then Chellappa realised and ordered to reconstruct the temple to today's pride outlook.<br /> <br />KDR must have known the details of Andaal and Periazhwar in the childhood stage itself. Otherwise how he could write such a beautiful Kavya? <br /> <br />I remember little only about RA. K. Ra's Novel (but read) which was serialised in Kumudham and I think he introduce a doctor of Portugese native and KDR's gangar's war.<br /> <br />Readers can share more.<br /> <br />Dhivakar</p>

<p>Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>this will vbe a very great Service to future generation.</p>
<p>Like Kalki created genuine interest among some of the readers (atleast) in the History of cholas and moovendars in turn, Krishnadevaraya will also generate such interest .. likewise Nayaks and Sarfoji's History  as well ...</p>
<p>when speaking to Dr. nagaswamy recently he casually told me that near Mutharasanallur (Mootha Raja Nallur ?? ) Trichy, ALLUR DEVATHANAM - the Siva Temple was Constructed by the PENDIR OF  KODUMBALUR IRUKKUVELIR  !!</p>
<p>Means w/o Sundara Chola - Vanavanmadevi related Queens constructed a Siva temple on the banks of Cauvery between Trichy and Kulithalai at a place called Allur.  (Kumbabhishegam planned again on 27th Nov this year - with the support of locals).</p>
<p>Allur is adjoining Mahadanapuram - which was ONE AMONG CHODASA (16) grants (Dhanams)  by KRISHNA DEVARAYA !!</p>
<p>Very rightly arun venkataraman pointed out... without Krishnadevaraya - cant imagine revival of our culture - language and heritage in Southern parts of India - particularly TN after invasions.</p>
<p>VERY APT TO RECALL HIS 500 YEAR GLORY..</p>
<p>And this is a SMALL SPARK created by dear friend Sunder Krishnan.</p>
<p>We will do our best to support him.</p>
<p>most welcome dear Sundar Krishnan.  pls feel at home..</p>
<p>best regards to Venkat and Sundar Krishnan,</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi all<br />  we have a silent achiever in this group.<br />  a man who has quietly gone about collecting tamil historical novels.<br />  i post here his mail to me</p>
<p>  venketesh</p>
<p>  Dear Sir</p>
<p>  Thanks for your mail.  PFA the list of my historical novel collections in pdf form.  So for I have spent Rs. 45000 to collect / purchase these novels.  60% of the novels purchased directly from publications /author.  These project started in the year of 2006.  So for 387 novels collected.  Still pending is 40 novels which is having a  problem that most of the novels are very old and not able to find the author address.</p>
<p>  I have to thank Easwary Lending library and 40% of the novels purchased from them due to out of stock in the publications.  Also  Nivethitha Mr. Swaminathan (SRS).  He helped me a lot.  In the mean time,I have to say my special thanks to Mr. Vikraman who is guided me in various time.  When I start reading Kalki's novel in my college days I was admired by his flow.  Also I noted that the historical novel shows how our ancient people live and their total living activities though it is sometime over sided by some authors.  At my early days I am unable to spend money to purchase and read the books.  Not even novels but also my college books.  I spend most of my timings in the college library and Sarasvathi Mahal library.</p>
<p>  Once I joined in the IT, I have decided to make it as a habit and met Mr.Vikraman, Mr. Kovi Manisekaran, Mr. Gowthama Neelambaran, Mr. Thivakar, Mr. Mukilan, Mr. Aikann and Mr. Viswaknesan.  When I discussed with them, I understand that how much time they are taking to write a novel and alsohow much painful it is.  To complete / write one historical novel, they have done a lot of research regarding the story main theme.</p>
<p>  I have asked them most of the novels are not re-published or after the author period, no one interested to re-publish the same.  In that case why it is not computerized.  Mr. Thivakar replied that some of the new writers they are preserving the DTP work in CD format.  But old novels…?  No answer for this.</p>
<p>  If you take Mr. Lakshmi narayanan.Y.  and Mr. Somu  most of thenovels are not available.</p>
<p>  This is the story of my interest in the historical novel collection.  Last but not least Novles are the good friend rather than a man hood.  It is not expecting any thing from me.  Only thing I have to preserve them and spend few rupees.  When ever I required, it will talk to me.</p>
<p>  Thanks and Regards</p>
<p>  Sundar Krishnan</p>

        <p>Vijay!<br /> <br />You may be right. But when KDR dies, he has no son and utilising opportunity his brother-in-law- cum-Maappillai, tried to take over the crown, with the help of Saluva Thimmarasu, but Atchutha raya thwarted that attempt and took over the realm. <br /> <br />Mr. TM Sundar asked why telugu (and not even Kannada) was extensively used when he was a Tulu by birth?<br />Even today, Tulu is not having proper lipi.(When I went to Mangalore, the Udupi University Professor whose name i will give in my next post, has shownthe script of Tulu, but yet to be popularised). But the fact is, KDR was surrounded by Telugu Kings of Velema and Reddys, who were all once enemies too, Telugu Brahmin Scholars-cum-'warriors' and his AshtathiggajangaL are mostly Telugus. <br /> <br />Bahmini sultans and Gajapathi's are staunch enemies of KDR. . He had to take sides with powerful friends for defeating them. Velema Kings from immediate Rayalaseema area, which is adjacent to Vijayanagara and Reddys of still northern (north of Tungabhadra) and their splinter groups, got plum posts with KDR. Already the Vijayanagara Kings during 1370's helped Tamils by removing Muslim kingdom at Madurai and established their overlordships with three parts, Madurai Nayaga, Tanjai Nayaga and Senji Nayaga, all are telugu's.<br /> <br />And naturally Telugu got the official language status in Tamilnadu for morethan 200 years till the arrival of Marathas at Tanjore and Muslims in the northern and western Tamilnadu.<br /> <br />One more additional information. Rayalaseema farming community are great technecians in bringing out deep ground water. For tank irrigation and watering the cotton in the plains of Madurai east and Southern parts, large sections of telugu's were sent to this part  and they have settled there permanently. Like wise the telugu brahmins were sent to Tanjai and Maudrai toassist the Kings in administrative matters and revenue collections from the villages. Even now we can see lot of Telugu speaking Brahmins in Tanjai and Madurai districts. The great Thiagayya was a telugu brahmin settled at Tiruvaiyaru.<br /> <br />D<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The telugu population slowly moved from the dry part of rayala</p>

<p>  Dear Sir</p>
<p>  Thanks for your mail.  PFA the list of my historical novel collections in pdf form.  So for I have spent Rs. 45000 to collect / purchase these novels.  60% of the novels purchased directly from publications /author.  These project started in the year of 2006.  So for 387 novels collected.  Still pending is 40 novels which is having a  problem that most of the novels are very old and not able to find the author address.</p>
<p>  I have to thank Easwary Lending library and 40% of the novels purchased from them due to out of stock in the publications.  Also  Nivethitha Mr. Swaminathan (SRS).  He helped me a lot.  In the mean time,I have to say my special thanks to Mr. Vikraman who is guided me in various time.  When I start reading Kalki's novel in my college days I was admired by his flow.  Also I noted that the historical novel shows how our ancient people live and their total living activities though it is sometime over sided by some authors.  At my early days I am unable to spend money to purchase and read the books.  Not even novels but also my college books.  I spend most of my timings in the college library and Sarasvathi Mahal library.</p>
<p>  Once I joined in the IT, I have decided to make it as a habit and met Mr.Vikraman, Mr. Kovi Manisekaran, Mr. Gowthama Neelambaran, Mr. Thivakar, Mr. Mukilan, Mr. Aikann and Mr. Viswaknesan.  When I discussed with them, I understand that how much time they are taking to write a novel and alsohow much painful it is.  To complete / write one historical novel, they have done a lot of research regarding the story main theme.</p>
<p>  I have asked them most of the novels are not re-published or after the author period, no one interested to re-publish the same.  In that case why it is not computerized.  Mr. Thivakar replied that some of the new writers they are preserving the DTP work in CD format.  But old novels…?  No answer for this.</p>
<p>  If you take Mr. Lakshmi narayanan.Y.  and Mr. Somu  most of thenovels are not available.</p>
<p>  This is the story of my interest in the historical novel collection.  Last but not least Novles are the good friend rather than a man hood.  It is not expecting any thing from me.  Only thing I have to preserve them and spend few rupees.  When ever I required, it will talk to me.</p>
<p>  Thanks and Regards</p>
<p>  Sundar Krishnan</p>

<p>     Once I joined in the IT, I have decided to make it as a habit and met<br />   Mr. Vikraman, Mr. Kovi Manisekaran, Mr. Gowthama Neelambaran, Mr. Thivakar,<br />   Mr. Mukilan, Mr. Aikann and Mr. Viswaknesan. When I discussed with them, I<br />   understand that how much time they are taking to write a novel and also how<br />   much painful it is. To complete / write one historical novel, they have<br />   done a lot of research regarding the story main theme.</p>
<p>     I have asked them most of the novels are not re-published or after the<br />   author period, no one interested to re-publish the same. In that case why<br />   it is not computerized. Mr. Thivakar replied that some of the new writers<br />   they are preserving the DTP work in CD format. But old novels?? No answer<br />   for this.</p>
<p>     If you take Mr. Lakshmi narayanan.Y. and Mr. Somu most of the novels<br />   are not available.</p>
<p>     This is the story of my interest in the historical novel collection.<br />   Last but not least Novles are the good friend rather than a man hood. It<br />   is not expecting any thing from me. Only thing I have to preserve them and<br />   spend few rupees. When ever I required, it will talk to me.</p>
<p>     Thanks and Regards</p>
<p>     Sundar Krishnan</p>
