<p>Details as follow</p>
<p>geneology is about your family tree to know about your origins.this <br />is intresting subject is part of my studies on senior sitizen <br />documenting programme.</p>
<p>What is genealogy?</p>
<p>Genealogy is: "an account or history of the descent of a person or <br />family from an ancestor; enumeration of ancestors and their children <br />in the natural order of succession; a pedigree</p>
<p>Where did you come from? What is your family history? </p>
<p>please spend some time with sr members of your family and start <br />collect information about family hisory of yoursBe exact with dates <br />and place names, if you are not sure, ask your parents to confirm <br />with correct dates . You can collect special things about your life <br />at this time, where you lived, if you've moved at all and special <br />memories you have. </p>
<p>Next, do the same as above for your brothers and sisters, if you <br />have them. If you have step-siblings, or half brothers/sisters be <br />sure to include with their information. </p>
<p>Parents: </p>
<p>Now it's time to move onto your parents. Sit down with your appa and <br />amma and record their information. Get birth dates, and where they <br />were born. Also include marriage dates and location. </p>
<p>please ask memories about your parents, or have them tell you <br />something about what they remember as children. Also include your <br />parents occupations. </p>
<p>please sitting down with your parents, you can also ask them about <br />their parents, brothers and sisters. If you do not have access to <br />your living relatives, or if they are deceased, be sure to write <br />down this information as well. </p>
<p>Grandparents: </p>
<p>If your grandparents live near by, call them and ask to set up a day <br />to record their family history. Most grandparents love doing this. <br />It's a great way to spend the day with them. </p>
<p>please be with your parents ask their Record their full names, birth <br />dates, birth locations, marriage date and other pertinent <br />information. If one of your grandparents has passed away, you can <br />get that information from the other. </p>
<p>If you have step-grandparents you can do the same for them. </p>
<p>In your leisure ask your grandparents about their lives, what they <br />did, where they have lived and travelled. You can also ask about <br />their other children, your Aunts and Uncles. If your grandparents <br />immigrated from another country be sure to collect information about <br />how they got where they are now. </p>
<p>Grandparents can be a key to going back in your family history. If <br />their parents, your Great Grandparents, have passed on, be sure to <br />collect information about them as well. If your Great Grandparents <br />are alive, you can set up meetings to talk to them yourself if they <br />live nearby. </p>
<p>Going Further Back: </p>
<p>In addition to parents and grandparents, you can talk with living <br />relatives you have to record their information. Aunts, Uncles and <br />cousins can all be very helpful with dates and information. </p>
<p>Once you have interviewed all of the living relatives you possibly <br />can, there are still ways to go further back in your family tree. <br />Once you determine where your family came from, Census records, <br />Church and Parish records, cemetery records from those locations may <br />help you determine who your ancestors were. </p>
<p>Newspaper archives will also help you trace birth, death and <br />marriage records. Many newspapers keep archives that are often <br />searchable at their locations. </p>
<p>There may also be a local genealogy club or jothidar of your family <br />that can help you find the information you need.  </p>
<p>On of my favorite sources is Family Search Organization. Not only do <br />they have wonderful resources to help you get started, they have a <br />vast database of ancestry information that is searchable and free. </p>
<p>There are hundreds of resources online for searching for your <br />ancestors. While some are free, some are pay to use. Be sure to read <br />all details when visiting these sites. Doing a simple search on a <br />search engine, like Google, of your surname, may help you get <br />started online. </p>
<p>I have done extensive research on my own family. If you have <br />questions or get stuck, feel free to post a question and I'll try to <br />help you out. My areas of research are mainly in tamilnadu and <br />orissa Tracing your family can be a lot of fun, and also sometimes, <br />frustrating but with some digging you may uncover some interesting <br />stories about who you are and where you came from. </p>

<p>    geneology is about your family tree to know about your <br />  origins.this <br />    is intresting subject is part of my studies on senior sitizen <br />    documenting programme.</p>
<p>    What is genealogy?</p>
<p>    Genealogy is: "an account or history of the descent of a person <br />or <br />    family from an ancestor; enumeration of ancestors and their <br />  children <br />    in the natural order of succession; a pedigree</p>
<p>    Where did you come from? What is your family history? </p>
<p>    please spend some time with sr members of your family and start <br />    collect information about family hisory of yoursBe exact with <br />  dates <br />    and place names, if you are not sure, ask your parents to confirm <br />    with correct dates . You can collect special things about your <br />  life <br />    at this time, where you lived, if you've moved at all and special <br />    memories you have. </p>
<p>    Next, do the same as above for your brothers and sisters, if you <br />    have them. If you have step-siblings, or half brothers/sisters be <br />    sure to include with their information. </p>
<p>    Parents: </p>
<p>    Now it's time to move onto your parents. Sit down with your appa <br />  and <br />    amma and record their information. Get birth dates, and where <br />they <br />    were born. Also include marriage dates and location. </p>
<p>    please ask memories about your parents, or have them tell you <br />    something about what they remember as children. Also include your <br />    parents occupations. </p>
<p>    please sitting down with your parents, you can also ask them <br />about <br />    their parents, brothers and sisters. If you do not have access to <br />    your living relatives, or if they are deceased, be sure to write <br />    down this information as well. </p>
<p>    Grandparents: </p>
<p>    If your grandparents live near by, call them and ask to set up a <br />  day <br />    to record their family history. Most grandparents love doing <br />this. <br />    It's a great way to spend the day with them. </p>
<p>    please be with your parents ask their Record their full names, <br />  birth <br />    dates, birth locations, marriage date and other pertinent <br />    information. If one of your grandparents has passed away, you can <br />    get that information from the other. </p>
<p>    If you have step-grandparents you can do the same for them. </p>
<p>    In your leisure ask your grandparents about their lives, what <br />they <br />    did, where they have lived and travelled. You can also ask about <br />    their other children, your Aunts and Uncles. If your grandparents <br />    immigrated from another country be sure to collect information <br />  about <br />    how they got where they are now. </p>
<p>    Grandparents can be a key to going back in your family history. <br />If <br />    their parents, your Great Grandparents, have passed on, be sure <br />to <br />    collect information about them as well. If your Great <br />Grandparents <br />    are alive, you can set up meetings to talk to them yourself if <br />  they <br />    live nearby. </p>
<p>    Going Further Back: </p>
<p>    In addition to parents and grandparents, you can talk with living <br />    relatives you have to record their information. Aunts, Uncles and <br />    cousins can all be very helpful with dates and information. </p>
<p>    Once you have interviewed all of the living relatives you <br />possibly <br />    can, there are still ways to go further back in your family tree. <br />    Once you determine where your family came from, Census records, <br />    Church and Parish records, cemetery records from those locations <br />  may <br />    help you determine who your ancestors were. </p>
<p>    Newspaper archives will also help you trace birth, death and <br />    marriage records. Many newspapers keep archives that are often <br />    searchable at their locations. </p>
<p>    There may also be a local genealogy club or jothidar of your <br />  family <br />    that can help you find the information you need. </p>
<p>    On of my favorite sources is Family Search Organization. Not only <br />  do <br />    they have wonderful resources to help you get started, they have <br />a <br />    vast database of ancestry information that is searchable and <br />free. </p>
<p>    There are hundreds of resources online for searching for your <br />    ancestors. While some are free, some are pay to use. Be sure to <br />  read <br />    all details when visiting these sites. Doing a simple search on a <br />    search engine, like Google, of your surname, may help you get <br />    started online. </p>
<p>    I have done extensive research on my own family. If you have <br />    questions or get stuck, feel free to post a question and I'll try <br />  to <br />    help you out. My areas of research are mainly in tamilnadu and <br />    orissa Tracing your family can be a lot of fun, and also <br />  sometimes, <br />    frustrating but with some digging you may uncover some <br />interesting <br />    stories about who you are and where you came from.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Did you know that a 16-year-old princess from Ayodhya went to Korea <br />  in 48 ce? A 13th-century Korean text recounts Princess Heo Hwang-ok <br />  explaining that her parents: "dreamt a God came who said, 'I have <br />  sent down Suro to be king of Kaya. Suro is a holy man and is not yet <br />  married. So send your daughter to be his Queen." She sailed from <br />  India, taking a stone pagoda (left) to what is now Kimhae city. <br />  South Korea's 72nd generation descendents of King Suro believe they <br />  are related to India's present day Raja Bimlendra Mohan Prasad <br />  Mishra, whose ancestors ruled Ayodhya. (Both families have two <br />  fishes as their insignia.) They sent delegations to India to built a <br />  monument in Ayodhya to commemorate the relationship. Though Mishra <br />  is unable to trace his ancestry back more than 300 years, he is <br />  happy to accept the Koreans' belief and their initiative to invest <br />  $2 billion to make Ayodhya a sister city of Kimhae. "It will lead to <br />  the progress of Ayodhya and I am happy, " he said. "The fact that it <br />  is associated with my family makes it special."</p>

          What is genealogy?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Did you know that a 16-year-old princess from Ayodhya went to Korea <br />in 48 ce? A 13th-century Korean text recounts Princess Heo Hwang-ok <br />explaining that her parents: "dreamt a God came who said, 'I have <br />sent down Suro to be king of Kaya. Suro is a holy man and is not yet <br />married. So send your daughter to be his Queen." She sailed from <br />India, taking a stone pagoda (left) to what is now Kimhae city. <br />South Korea's 72nd generation descendents of King Suro believe they <br />are related to India's present day Raja Bimlendra Mohan Prasad <br />Mishra, whose ancestors ruled Ayodhya. (Both families have two <br />fishes as their insignia.) They sent delegations to India to built a <br />monument in Ayodhya to commemorate the relationship. Though Mishra <br />is unable to trace his ancestry back more than 300 years, he is <br />happy to accept the Koreans' belief and their initiative to invest <br />$2 billion to make Ayodhya a sister city of Kimhae. "It will lead to <br />the progress of Ayodhya and I am happy, " he said. "The fact that it <br />is associated with my family makes it special."</p>

<p>    geneology is about your family tree to know about your <br />origins.this <br />    is intresting subject is part of my studies on senior sitizen <br />    documenting programme.</p>
<p>    What is genealogy?</p>
<p>    Genealogy is: "an account or history of the descent of a person <br />or <br />    family from an ancestor; enumeration of ancestors and their <br />  children <br />    in the natural order of succession; a pedigree</p>
<p>    Where did you come from? What is your family history? </p>
<p>    please spend some time with sr members of your family and start <br />    collect information about family hisory of yoursBe exact with <br />dates <br />    and place names, if you are not sure, ask your parents to <br />confirm <br />    with correct dates . You can collect special things about your <br />life <br />    at this time, where you lived, if you've moved at all and <br />special <br />    memories you have. </p>
<p>    Next, do the same as above for your brothers and sisters, if you <br />    have them. If you have step-siblings, or half brothers/sisters <br />be <br />    sure to include with their information. </p>
<p>    Parents: </p>
<p>    Now it's time to move onto your parents. Sit down with your appa <br />  and <br />    amma and record their information. Get birth dates, and where <br />they <br />    were born. Also include marriage dates and location. </p>
<p>    please ask memories about your parents, or have them tell you <br />    something about what they remember as children. Also include <br />your <br />    parents occupations. </p>
<p>    please sitting down with your parents, you can also ask them <br />about <br />    their parents, brothers and sisters. If you do not have access <br />to <br />    your living relatives, or if they are deceased, be sure to write <br />    down this information as well. </p>
<p>    Grandparents: </p>
<p>    If your grandparents live near by, call them and ask to set up a <br />  day <br />    to record their family history. Most grandparents love doing <br />this. <br />    It's a great way to spend the day with them. </p>
<p>    please be with your parents ask their Record their full names, <br />  birth <br />    dates, birth locations, marriage date and other pertinent <br />    information. If one of your grandparents has passed away, you <br />can <br />    get that information from the other. </p>
<p>    If you have step-grandparents you can do the same for them. </p>
<p>    In your leisure ask your grandparents about their lives, what <br />they <br />    did, where they have lived and travelled. You can also ask about <br />    their other children, your Aunts and Uncles. If your <br />grandparents <br />    immigrated from another country be sure to collect information <br />  about <br />    how they got where they are now. </p>
<p>    Grandparents can be a key to going back in your family history. <br />If <br />    their parents, your Great Grandparents, have passed on, be sure <br />to <br />    collect information about them as well. If your Great <br />Grandparents <br />    are alive, you can set up meetings to talk to them yourself if <br />they <br />    live nearby. </p>
<p>    Going Further Back: </p>
<p>    In addition to parents and grandparents, you can talk with <br />living <br />    relatives you have to record their information. Aunts, Uncles <br />and <br />    cousins can all be very helpful with dates and information. </p>
<p>    Once you have interviewed all of the living relatives you <br />possibly <br />    can, there are still ways to go further back in your family <br />tree. <br />    Once you determine where your family came from, Census records, <br />    Church and Parish records, cemetery records from those locations <br />  may <br />    help you determine who your ancestors were. </p>
<p>    Newspaper archives will also help you trace birth, death and <br />    marriage records. Many newspapers keep archives that are often <br />    searchable at their locations. </p>
<p>    There may also be a local genealogy club or jothidar of your <br />family <br />    that can help you find the information you need.  </p>
<p>    On of my favorite sources is Family Search Organization. Not <br />only <br />  do <br />    they have wonderful resources to help you get started, they have <br />a <br />    vast database of ancestry information that is searchable and <br />free. </p>
<p>    There are hundreds of resources online for searching for your <br />    ancestors. While some are free, some are pay to use. Be sure to <br />  read <br />    all details when visiting these sites. Doing a simple search on <br />a <br />    search engine, like Google, of your surname, may help you get <br />    started online. </p>
<p>    I have done extensive research on my own family. If you have <br />    questions or get stuck, feel free to post a question and I'll <br />try <br />  to <br />    help you out. My areas of research are mainly in tamilnadu and <br />    orissa Tracing your family can be a lot of fun, and also <br />sometimes, <br />    frustrating but with some digging you may uncover some <br />interesting <br />    stories about who you are and where you came from.</p></kalinga_tamil@></p></blockquote>
