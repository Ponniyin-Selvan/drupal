<p>Very good point regarding movie remixes. In telugu the<br />movie Ramadasu recently starred Suman as Sri Rama.<br />Suman was a pornographic movie actor and was arrested<br />some time ago for soliciting college girls to make<br />porn movies. I agree actors cannot live up to their<br />images but while portraying godly images some respect<br />should be there.</p>
<p>The late NTR not only was graceful as an actor, he<br />abstained taking meat and alcohol out of deference to<br />the role. His own son Balakrishna said he took alcohol<br />and cannot portray Sri Rama therefore. </p>

        <p>Dear Members,</p>
<p>When the TN Government announced that the tamil New Year begins from <br />Tamil month " Thai first " (which announcement is already 3 month <br />old) Where is the question of protesting that now?</p>
<p>When Media - particulary TV Channels with Mass viewership also <br />used " Chithirai pirappu " and things like that we can also record <br />our views here and be done with it ...</p>
<p>Since the topic is discussed my view is :</p>
<p>SARVAJITH was last Tamil New Year ..</p>
<p>IN this word SARVA is NOT TAMIL DICTION. JITH too.</p>
<p>This Year is SARVA DHARI ... Again same thing.</p>
<p>When did this 60 year NAMING OF TAMIL YEARS occur ?<br />who did ? when commenced ?<br />How commended from Chithirai ?</p>
<p>Why TN Government is telling this to be computed from " Thai" ?</p>
<p>With these concrete points made available for discussion we can put <br />forward our views .. instead of mentioning specific names / <br />parties / races.</p>
<p>Vaazhthukkal,</p>

<p>  I agree with you Satish. There should have been some protests. But <br />  nothing. Why? Tamilian's backbone is already broken.</p>
<p>  When our temple sculptures were painted with oil paints and made <br />our <br />  goddess look like a bar girl with mini skirt, we did not protest.</p>
<p>  When pillaiyaar was given AK47 and military dress during vinayakar <br />  chadhurthi, our blood did not boil.</p>
<p>  When temples were destroyed and bathroom tiles were fixed inside <br />the <br />  sanctum in the name of renovation, our nenju poruththadhu.</p>
<p>  When governments murdered their citizens in the name of religion, <br />we <br />  didnt have guts to raise the voice.</p>
<p>  When government intervened in the culture of siru dheyva <br />vazhipaadu, <br />  we least bothered about that.</p>
<p>  When mutts involved in murder cases, we convinced ourselves as <br />  political tit-for-tat.</p>
<p>  When school students were forced to sing saraswati vandhanam, we <br />  tried to justify that saraswati is common to everyone.</p>
<p>  Then, how can you expect such boneless creatures to react only for <br />  this? Just because we are programmed to attribute bad things to <br />DMK <br />  and find faults only in Dravidian parties?</p>

<p>    Hope the new year sees many more great events in PS group... <br />  wishing good luck to all the <br />    new plans that we have ahead....</p>
<p>    Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, after <br />  talking with my friend in <br />    Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the new <br />  year. The happenings in <br />    TN disturbed me....</p>
<p>    This mail might bring in a lot criticism and opposition, and <br />even <br />  the moderators might be <br />    requested to delete this posting......</p>
<p>    I am also disturbed that the number of mails wishing for the new <br />  year is only 2 or 3 <br />    compared to the previous years...Hope people got me where I am <br />  coming to....</p>
<p>    THough i read sometime back that the Govt. is planning to <br />celebrate <br />  Thai 1 as Tamil New <br />    yaer and not chittirai 1, i didnt think it will be of such <br />  magnitude. Its ATROCIOUS to <br />    intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote from <br />a <br />  few. I was shocked to hear <br />    from my friend that all tv channels say 'chitirai tirunal <br />  vazhthukkal' (as did one of our <br />    member) and not puthandu vazhtukkal..</p>
<p>    I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If people <br />say <br />  that this group is not <br />    the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is certainly <br />in <br />  our groups purview. When we <br />    say we are trying to protect our culture and history, is this <br />not a <br />  big hit to our culture?</p>
<p>    'Nenju porukudhillaye..intha nilai ketta manitharai ninaithu <br />  vittaal'..beautiful words of <br />    Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont <br />have <br />  the back bone to fight <br />    against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I <br />talked <br />  with my friend around <br />    1.30 in the night (my time) and i could not sleep further. <br />  Wondering where the country is <br />    heading.. </p>
<p>    Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not even <br />a <br />  mention of this in our <br />    group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on the <br />new <br />  year. If tanjai periya <br />    koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest <br />  saying that its a hit for our <br />    culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?</p>
<p>    who gave these people such authority to change religious things <br />as <br />  they wish. Will these <br />    people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it cam <br />eout <br />  of India we should not <br />    follow that calendar? </p>
<p>    Ravi, </p>
<p>    I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu <br />  mythology. I used to think in <br />    those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I feel <br />  these are also mini <br />    pralaya's where the dharma is being disturbed. </p>
<p>    If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the <br />  caveat of creamy layer, our <br />    so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will revisit <br />  the criteria for creamy <br />    layer..</p>
<p>    For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the state <br />and <br />  the country, say that <br />    without these people their community could not have improved, I <br />  like to quote Swami <br />    Chinmayananda,</p>
<p>    'The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they <br />could <br />  have done better, if the <br />    situations were different'.</p>
<p>    How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people will <br />be <br />  bashing the hindu and <br />    their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but <br />who <br />  the hell are they to say <br />    that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai 1? </p>
<p>    Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not <br />on <br />  the streets. </p>
<p>    Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what <br />  should be written in this <br />    group. As rightly pointed out by Arun (is that Arun? ) we try to <br />  brush things under the <br />    carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it and <br />  gain and spread knowledge <br />    about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan invasion <br />  theory is a myth, we still <br />    stick to it because talking about it going to create controversy.</p>
<p>    And we say that this group likes to bring out true history and <br />  preserve culture, but dont <br />    spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.</p>
<p>    Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from <br />others <br />  perspective, this mail is <br />    surely not related this group.</p>
<p>    God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism...</p>

        <p>you missed out cinema - divnie hymns remixed to become cheap numbers. <br />infact i was shocked to see a recent number portraying the hero and <br />heroine dressed as krishna n radha etc etc. compare this to the days <br />of yore - NTR as krishnar - so much grace and character.. </p>
<p>had this kind of degrading even attemped to any other religion, the <br />culprits behind would be facing a fatwa and running for their lives. <br />not that i am for that radical moves, but certain things have a <br />dignity and sanctity associated with it. which is shockingly mocked by <br />these and the society by turning a blind eye to them sets a <br />precedent...</p>

        <p>//I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If people say <br />that this group is not the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. <br />This is certainly in our groups purview. When we say we are trying to <br />protect our culture and history, is this not a big hit to our <br />culture?//</p>
<p>I agree with you Satish. There should have been some protests. But <br />nothing. Why? Tamilian's backbone is already broken.</p>
<p>When our temple sculptures were painted with oil paints and made our <br />goddess look like a bar girl with mini skirt, we did not protest.</p>
<p>When pillaiyaar was given AK47 and military dress during vinayakar <br />chadhurthi, our blood did not boil.</p>
<p>When temples were destroyed and bathroom tiles were fixed inside the <br />sanctum in the name of renovation, our nenju poruththadhu.</p>
<p>When governments murdered their citizens in the name of religion, we <br />didnt have guts to raise the voice.</p>
<p>When government intervened in the culture of siru dheyva vazhipaadu, <br />we least bothered about that.</p>
<p>When mutts involved in murder cases, we convinced ourselves as <br />political tit-for-tat.</p>
<p>When school students were forced to sing saraswati vandhanam, we <br />tried to justify that saraswati is common to everyone.</p>
<p>Then, how can you expect such boneless creatures to react only for <br />this? Just because we are programmed to attribute bad things to DMK <br />and find faults only in Dravidian parties?</p>

<p>  Hope the new year sees many more great events in PS group... <br />wishing good luck to all the <br />  new plans that we have ahead....</p>
<p>  Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, after <br />talking with my friend in <br />  Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the new <br />year. The happenings in <br />  TN disturbed me....</p>
<p>  This mail might bring in a lot criticism and opposition, and even <br />the moderators might be <br />  requested to delete this posting......</p>
<p>  I am also disturbed that the number of mails wishing for the new <br />year is only 2 or 3 <br />  compared to the previous years...Hope people got me where I am <br />coming to....</p>
<p>  THough i read sometime back that the Govt. is planning to celebrate <br />Thai 1 as Tamil New <br />  yaer and not chittirai 1, i didnt think it will be of such <br />magnitude. Its ATROCIOUS to <br />  intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote from a <br />few. I was shocked to hear <br />  from my friend that all tv channels say 'chitirai tirunal <br />vazhthukkal' (as did one of our <br />  member) and not puthandu vazhtukkal..</p>
<p>  I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If people say <br />that this group is not <br />  the place to discuss this...I beg to differ.

<p>  'Nenju porukudhillaye..intha nilai ketta manitharai ninaithu <br />vittaal'..beautiful words of <br />  Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont have <br />the back bone to fight <br />  against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I talked <br />with my friend around <br />  1.30 in the night (my time) and i could not sleep further. <br />Wondering where the country is <br />  heading.. </p>
<p>  Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not even a <br />mention of this in our <br />  group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on the new <br />year. If tanjai periya <br />  koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest <br />saying that its a hit for our <br />  culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?</p>
<p>  who gave these people such authority to change religious things as <br />they wish. Will these <br />  people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it cam eout <br />of India we should not <br />  follow that calendar? </p>
<p>  Ravi, </p>
<p>  I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu <br />mythology. I used to think in <br />  those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I feel <br />these are also mini <br />  pralaya's where the dharma is being disturbed. </p>
<p>  If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the <br />caveat of creamy layer, our <br />  so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will revisit <br />the criteria for creamy <br />  layer..</p>
<p>  For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the state and <br />the country, say that <br />  without these people their community could not have improved, I <br />like to quote Swami <br />  Chinmayananda,</p>
<p>  'The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they could <br />have done better, if the <br />  situations were different'.</p>
<p>  How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people will be <br />bashing the hindu and <br />  their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but who <br />the hell are they to say <br />  that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai 1? </p>
<p>  Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not on <br />the streets. </p>
<p>  Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what <br />should be written in this <br />  group. As rightly pointed out by Arun (is that Arun? ) we try to <br />brush things under the <br />  carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it and <br />gain and spread knowledge <br />  about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan invasion <br />theory is a myth, we still <br />  stick to it because talking about it going to create controversy.</p>
<p>  And we say that this group likes to bring out true history and <br />preserve culture, but dont <br />  spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.</p>
<p>  Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from others <br />perspective, this mail is <br />  surely not related this group.</p>
<p>  God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism...</p>

        <p>Ravi, in some ways we are far from ideal, but want to<br />say one thing though - seeking 'arul' is a personal<br />path for each person. It is possible if you are in<br />India, in Iceland, Australia or anywhere in the world.<br />Bharati wrote many of his poems in dark cell rooms, he<br />didn't have any ideal outside circumstance either.</p>
<p>If we seek 'perinbam' as individuals through us that<br />inbam will spread all over the world .Yaam petra inbam<br />peruga iv vaiyyagam, that is all it is.</p>

<p>  more importantly, porul illaruku ivulagam ? but the<br />  Arul is how it <br />  should end.</p>
<p>  Anyway, Barathi wrote a precision song optimal for<br />  our country in <br />  today's life ,I believe the great poet foresaw the<br />  future generations <br />  and wrote the lines 'Nallathor veenai (Bharatam)<br />  seithe athai nalam <br />  keda puzhuthiyil (Today's bharatham)<br />  erivatundo...then... he goes on <br />  to say, Solladi abirami, ennai sudar migum arivudan<br />  padaithu vittai, <br />  vallamai thaarayo intha maanilam payanura<br />  vazhvatharke (such songs <br />  are his gift to us so we can get back to<br />  establishing that path of <br />  life).</p>

<p>more importantly, porul illaruku ivulagam ? but the Arul is how it <br />should end.</p>
<p>Anyway, Barathi wrote a precision song optimal for our country in <br />today's life ,I believe the great poet foresaw the future generations <br />and wrote the lines 'Nallathor veenai (Bharatam) seithe athai nalam <br />keda puzhuthiyil (Today's bharatham) erivatundo...then... he goes on <br />to say, Solladi abirami, ennai sudar migum arivudan padaithu vittai, <br />vallamai thaarayo intha maanilam payanura vazhvatharke (such songs <br />are his gift to us so we can get back to establishing that path of <br />life).</p>

        <p>Bharathi is a genius.. again a poor soul who was neglected by the <br />govts. for the simple reason that he was a brahmin by birth. Again for <br />people who say Bharathi has been respected by all and has been given <br />the due respect, I beg to differ, no Dravida katchi quotes him and they <br />quote only Bharathidasan, no govt. officials garland him on his birth <br />or death anniversay.</p>
<p>I used to wonder, If he had sung so broken hearted in those days, what <br />would have he sung if he is alive today? Probably he would have took up <br />arms? He was a revolutionist in his own sense for his period.</p>

        <p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>The 2 or 3 wishes which i mentioned includes those 2 :) But still till <br />last year we had floods of wishes,and even for Jan 1 we do get flooded.</p>
<p>Changing Tamil new year from chitirai 1 to thai 1 is ofcourse <br />political, but forcing not to read panchangam in temples on chitirai 1 -<br />what do you want to call it? And if I am not wrong, panchangam is <br />prepared and read by brahmins in most of the temples (or all?). I have <br />never witnessed it so I am not sure who reads it or what they read. But <br />still its a attack on the hindu beliefs. Will Karunanidhi dare to do <br />this with other religions? Will he dare to say that in TN only thai 1 <br />should be observed as new year and hence there should be no prayers in <br />the church on 1st Jan? </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

<p>  Satish, no worries, people may have not protested as possibly <br />they <br />  think the govt may not last for long :-) Other option is many <br />are <br />  busy with their lives and they do not feel it necessary to <br />deem tamil <br />  new year as a critical aspect of life.<br />  Ofcourse, Pongal - Navarathiri - Diwali have bigger 'ratings' <br />than <br />  Tamil new year in many of our younger generation atleast in <br />the major <br />  cities.</p>
<p>  We are moving towards a mini pralayam ofcourse (current <br />global <br />  financial crisis is a pralyam ofcourse) - I have always <br />wondered how <br />  India manages her grass root credit and mortgage, just going <br />by pay <br />  slip etc is something I fail to understand.

<p>    Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, <br />after <br />  talking with my friend in <br />    Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the <br />new <br />  year. The happenings in <br />    TN disturbed me....</p>

<p>    THough i read sometime back that the Govt. is planning to <br />celebrate <br />  Thai 1 as Tamil New <br />    yaer and not chittirai 1, i didnt think it will be of such <br />  magnitude. Its ATROCIOUS to <br />    intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote from <br />a <br />  few. I was shocked to hear <br />    from my friend that all tv channels say 'chitirai tirunal <br />  vazhthukkal' (as did one of our <br />    member) and not puthandu vazhtukkal..</p>
<p>    I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If <br />people say <br />  that this group is not <br />    the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is certainly in <br />  our groups purview. When we <br />    say we are trying to protect our culture and history, is this <br />not a <br />  big hit to our culture?</p>
<p>    'Nenju porukudhillaye..intha nilai ketta manitharai ninaithu <br />  vittaal'..beautiful words of <br />    Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont <br />have <br />  the back bone to fight <br />    against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I <br />talked <br />  with my friend around <br />    1.30 in the night (my time) and i could not sleep further. <br />  Wondering where the country is <br />    heading.. </p>
<p>    Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not <br />even a <br />  mention of this in our <br />    group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing <br />on the new <br />  year. If tanjai periya <br />    koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we <br />protest <br />  saying that its a hit for our <br />    culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?</p>
<p>    who gave these people such authority to change religious <br />things as <br />  they wish. Will these <br />    people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it <br />cam eout <br />  of India we should not <br />    follow that calendar? </p>
<p>    Ravi, </p>
<p>    I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on <br />Hindu <br />  mythology. I used to think in <br />    those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I <br />feel <br />  these are also mini <br />    pralaya's where the dharma is being disturbed. </p>
<p>    If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with <br />the <br />  caveat of creamy layer, our <br />    so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will <br />revisit <br />  the criteria for creamy <br />    layer..</p>
<p>    For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the <br />state and <br />  the country, say that <br />    without these people their community could not have <br />improved, I <br />  like to quote Swami <br />    Chinmayananda,</p>
<p>    'The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they <br />could <br />  have done better, if the <br />    situations were different'.</p>
<p>    How long these atrocities can go on? How long these <br />people will be <br />  bashing the hindu and <br />    their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, <br />but who <br />  the hell are they to say <br />    that panchangam should not be read in the temples on <br />cithirai 1? </p>
<p>    Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if <br />not on <br />  the streets. </p>
<p>    Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and <br />what <br />  should be written in this <br />    group. As rightly pointed out by Arun (is that Arun? ) we <br />try to <br />  brush things under the <br />    carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it <br />and <br />  gain and spread knowledge <br />    about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan <br />invasion <br />  theory is a myth, we still <br />    stick to it because talking about it going to create <br />controversy.</p>

        <p>Satish, your passion is well placed. I also hear that<br />temples are not allowed to read 'panchangam' and are<br />being forced to abide by english new year. I am very<br />much shocked myself. But at this time I believe there<br />are more things to be shocked. The food crisis is #1<br />on the list. Farmers are committing suicide more than<br />ever. No vegetable is less than 40 Rs per kg and riots<br />are happening all over the world.</p>
<p>As a humanist first and foremost I prefer to pay heed<br />to this more than what the stupid DMK government does.<br />Our religion and tradition has survived years of<br />assault and will survive this also.</p>
