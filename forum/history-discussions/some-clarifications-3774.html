</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Venkatesh and Satish,</p>
<p>Thanks for your mails. We requested to notify our mistakes in the <br />past. You did it. This helps us to correct ourselves.</p>
<p>Dear VK and Shankaran,</p>
<p>That is the right attitude towards finding truth. Keep it up.</p>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Since, there were some discussions and finger pointing based on an <br />article published in our varlaaru.com, we feel it is our <br />responsibility to explain. So, I take this opportunity to clarify <br />certain things happening for past 1 year on behalf of varalaaru team.</p>
<p>1. Regarding Buddha and Rajaraja photos</p>
<p>When we made trip to thanjavur and pazhaiyaarai last year by this <br />time, some of us accepted that the person in thanjavur painting was <br />Rajaraja and the person in panchavan madhevi pallippadai was <br />Rajendra based on the location and 'who else it could be' basis. But <br />for some of us, it was not convincing proof. So, i just wanted to <br />let them understand what all they have to accept if they start <br />accepting without considering other negative evidences. So, I posted <br />a picture of Buddha statue with chakra mark in it. As Rajaraja also <br />had sangu chakra rekhai in his palms according to Thiruvalangadu <br />copper plates, i told it has to be considered as Rajaraja. People <br />started disproving the statement and gave valid points why it cannot <br />be Rajaraja. I was happy and hoped that people would apply the same <br />rules for the issues raised during the trip too. So, I ended the <br />drama with explanation of my actual intention.</p>
<p>Swetha oru dheerkka dharisi. Her words</p>
<p>"Kamal, neenga Japan ponalum intha pavam ungalai uruthu vanthu <br />oottum!"</p>
<p>has become true now. I have changed the description of the pictures. <br />So, new members won't get misguided.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>2. Rajaraja and Karuvoor thevar painting</p>
<p>It was told that the young man and old man in thanjavur painting <br />were Rajaraja and his spiritual guru Karuvoor thevar. But from <br />inscriptions of Rajarajeswaram, we knew that Rajaraja's guru <br />was 'Eesana siva pandithar' and not Karuvoor thevar. Karuvoor thevar <br />was not mentioned in any of Rajaraja period inscriptions. It clearly <br />proves that there was no relationship between Rajaraja and <br />Karuvooraar even if a person by name Karuvoor thevar lived during <br />that period. Thiruvisaippaa was quoted for proof. When i went <br />through that, i misunderstood Thirubhuvanam with Thiru poovanam. <br />When Venkatesh notified that, I couldn't reply immediately as i <br />became busy at work and some personal commitments. After that, new <br />threads were started and i forgot to reply to that. Anyway, I accept <br />that it was my mistake.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>3. Dr.Kalaikkovan magudaagamam-nu onnu illave illangararu.</p>
<p>Satish wrote this in his reply to Venkateswaran Kasirajan last week. <br />At first, SPS introduced Dr.Kudavoil Balu to varalaaru.com team <br />during mid 2004. Then, varalaaru team met Dr.Balu during December <br />2004 and early January 2005 while bringing special issue for <br />Rajarajeswaram. In all these three meetings, Dr.Balu mentioned that <br />Periya koyil was built based on Magudagamam concept. We requested <br />him to show the book. At that time, he said it is in Sanskrit. As of <br />now, in tamilnadu, only his guru Dr.Nagasamy can read and understand <br />that and even he himself cannot read it. When we met Dr.Kalaikkovan <br />on 26th January in Trichy as part of our 5 days mega trip, we asked <br />if he knows anything about Magudagamam. He said he also heard it <br />from Dr.Balu only during Big temple Kudamuzhukku around 10 years <br />ago. At that time itself he asked but couldn't see the book till <br />date. Whenever we discussed with Dr.Kalaikkovan about magudagamam <br />concept, he never told that it doesn't exist. He always told that he <br />hasn't seen it yet. Satish joined us in one or two trips during the <br />thiruvalanjuzhi research. At that time, we are not sure if <br />Dr.Kalaikkovan told satish like this. Satish only knows. In his <br />article also, he didn't mention that it does not exist. He just <br />wanted to see it.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>4. Varalaaru article claims that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's life was very well documented</p>
<p>Venkatesh raised this point in his reply to Satish's mail and he <br />tried to disprove saying "then why are we groping in the dark about <br />most of the details of his life and death?". I don't think anywhere <br />in the article it is mentioned that all the events in his life were <br />very well documented. It says only his significant achievements were <br />documented. Though unusually Rajaraja documented extensively, we <br />cannot expect him to mention when did he catch cold, how many times <br />he sneezed and all. I request to read the articles properly before <br />making such sweeping statements.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>5. Who else it could be? Rajaraja and Rajasimma</p>
<p>In his second mail to VK, Satish quoted that when Dr.Kalaikkovan <br />said that the statue of a king in Dharmaraja radham is Rajasimma <br />on 'who else it could be' basis, we accepted. In the same way, when <br />he said that painting in periya koyil is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  on the same basis, we <br />didn't accept. With this, he came to a conclusion that <br />Dr.Kalaikkovan accepts assumptions indirectly.</acronym></p>
<p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>Do you really think both 'Who else it could be' are same? I am not <br />sure if you have read the book 'Adhyandha kaamam' completely. <br />Otherwise, you wouldn't have raised this point. I give the summary <br />of points considered before concluding it is Rajasimma. If you are <br />not convinced still, it is my inability to explain as I don't have <br />the book with me right now and please go through the book.</p>
<p>Labeled Royal Portraits are usually met with only on prominent parts <br />of the temple such as the walls or the niches. You may refer to <br />Mahavaraaha temple at Mamallapuram and several other temples in the <br />cholamandalam (Thiruvaavaduthurai, Thiruvisaloor, Konerirajapuram, <br />etc). Dr. Kudavoil Balu himself has mentioned a few such labeled <br />portraits carved on the walls of the temple towers at Chidambaram in <br />his book entitled 'Goburakkalai marabu'.</p>
<p>Though labeled portrait sculptures are detected so far in the greeva <br />naasikaas or koodu in the kapodha, male figures worshipping linga <br />are depicted in many temples. Thiruvalanjuzhi is a good example <br />where one can identify many such figures. Don't you think that one <br />should take much care before identifying a figure as a particular <br />royal person? Is this not his duty to provide enough evidences to <br />substantiate such identity before it is questioned?</p>
<p>In the case of adhyandha kaamam, the creator of the temple was <br />identified after a thorough analysis of its architecture, iconology <br />and epigraphic records. This and the titles (Srimega, Sri Trilokya <br />vardhana and Vidhi) engraved on the niche where the sculpture is <br />placed, helped to confirm the portrait figure as Rajasimma.</p>
<p>Ram is translating the chapter 'Nizhalum Nijamum' from the <br />book 'Adhyandha kaamam' as Dr. Michael Lockwood asked for the <br />English version. We will send it soon.</p>
<p>Now, let us see the case of rajarajeswaram. In the saanthaaram <br />paintings, two persons are said to be Rajaraja.</p>
<p>a. Person worshipping Nataraja</p>
<p>Appearance of the person worshipping Nataraja has no dissimilarities <br />with Cheraman peruman naayanar portrayed in Sundarar panel. Cheraman <br />peruman was also a king. We cannot say only Rajaraja worshipped <br />Nataraja. So, it can be any king. All we can say is one king is <br />portrayed. That's all. 'Who else it could be' argument is <br />inappropriate here. We know for sure that two persons in other side <br />panel is Sundarar and Cheraman because we know the theme behind it <br />and other pieces of paintings in that panel are also supporting <br />this. This worshipping panel may also have some theme behind it. <br />Unless a complete study like 'Adhyandha kaamam' is carried out, we <br />cannot say who is who. Not only panel, which has that person, entire <br />panel in the wall has to be studied properly without any <br />preconceived notion. Even when the well known sundarar panel was <br />studied by Dr.Kalaikkovan, we encountered lot of stunning details. <br />They are going to be published in his book 'Vaanan vandhu vazhi <br />thandhu' shortly.</p>
<p>b. Young man and old man</p>
<p>The two persons are said to be Rajaraja and his guru karuvoor <br />thevar. Already it is proved that there is no relationship between <br />these two. The attire and hairstyle doesn't match with a king. <br />Moreover, Dr.Kudavoil Balu proved that they are 'Sanakaadhi <br />munivargal'. I am not sure if he has written any article on this. <br />But when varalaaru team met him in thanjavur for second or third <br />time, he explained how he concluded that they are sanakaadhi <br />munivargal. All his points were very much valid and acceptable. You <br />can ask him when you meet next time.</p>
<p>So, from this, we can conclude that both cannot be said to be <br />Rajaraja and both 'who else it could be' are not same.</p>
<p>Here, i would like to have a disclaimer. We are in the beginning <br />stage of learning historical research methodologies and subject. Our <br />explanation capabilities are limited. So, please do not go by our <br />statements which are not complete or quoted in different scenario. <br />When you encounter such things, please look at the source or ask for <br />more explanation. Because, already such confusion occurred in the <br />past regarding podhikai. In Pullamangai and Thiruvalanjuzhi, we had <br />less time and had lot of things to see other than podhikai. So, I <br />couldn't explain well. In that case, consulting the articles of <br />Kattadakkalai series would be helpful. Hope you understand my point.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>6. School of thought and ego clash</p>
<p>Venkatesh used to mention about "School of thought" in couple of his <br />mails in the sense we are adherents of Dr.Kalaikkovan's school of <br />thought. So, we hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu during his talk in tanjore. <br />I really don't understand where the scope for school of thought is <br />in the current scenario.</p>
<p>Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Which one do you mean by 'School of thought' here? If you <br />say 'Rajaraja was ego-centric person. So, he might have projected <br />him somewhere in his masterpiece temple', that is school of thought. <br />If you say 'Tholkappiyam has words like 'enmanaar pulavar'. So it <br />may belong to 7th century AD', that is school of thought. If you <br />say 'Thirukkural uses some of Jainism concepts. So, thiruvalluvar <br />may be a Jain', that is school of thought. But how can Magudagamam <br />and pon vimaanam concept be considered as School of thought when we <br />have evidences to disprove the role of Magudagamam in big temple?</p>
<p>And you said 'at last the clash of the egos has come to the <br />forefront'. It is not so. As i stated in the point 3, this issue was <br />brought out around 10 years before when the reference of magudagamam <br />was first quoted in Big temple Kumbabishekam malar. Many scholars <br />witnessed this. What do you mean by 'behind the scene and proxy <br />squabbling'? What is the necessity for us to hide and fight? Didn't <br />we ask these questions directly to Dr.Kudavoil Balu? If our <br />questions were answered already, why are we asking again and again? <br />Moreover, none of our questions are unanswerable during our times or <br />as difficult as finding Tutankhamen tomb.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>7. Varalaaru team hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu</p>
<p>Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>In the same mail, you said 'so many times we have all discussed how <br />Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled'. I frankly say that till this point <br />of time, we really don't understand how did we hassle him. You told <br />many times that we hassled him. But never told how. Even when Ram <br />asked you directly in the beach meeting, it was not responded <br />properly and topic got diverted. You said 'not only me. All of us <br />felt like that'. When I checked with some of the members, they said <br />they didn't think that Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled. I already <br />explained in the earlier messages. I am repeating here. Till this <br />date, varalaaru team is in good relationship with Dr.Kudavoil Balu. <br />We met couple of times even after our tanjore trip. If we are not <br />respecting him, why should we bring special issue on him? Why should <br />he allow us to publish his articles in guest section? Why should we <br />meet him again when we went to thanjavur? And I used to hear offline <br />comments like whatever Dr. Kudavoil Balu says, varalaaru team <br />doesn't accept. It is not true. When he says anything with proper <br />supportive evidences, we always accepted them. Best example is the <br />Sanakaadhi munivargal in the painting. If we oppose him blindly, why <br />should we accept this?</p>
<p>Satish may know that we ask many questions before accepting any info <br />told by even Dr.Kalaikkovan. How can cross verification be <br />considered as hassling? Dr.Balu is a well experienced scholar in the <br />field of epigraphy. His hard work cannot be discarded by anyone. <br />Already we asked him these questions we have asked here. He would <br />have faced lot of such questions from scholars like Subbarayalu as <br />well as beginners like us. He knows how to handle it. In spite of <br />all these, if you still want to believe that he was hassled, well, <br />go ahead. We don't have any objections.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>8. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru <br />team</acronym></p>
<p>I think this is the most important thing to be clarified. Because, <br />we are directly blamed here. Couldn't believe when we read the <br />following lines from SPS's mail. Immediately thought of asking 'You <br />too SB sir?'.</p>
<p>"Last year by this time we visited Thanjai ... we were thrilled to <br />go... after returning as Vencat rightly observed of various schools <br />of thoughts surfaced in open, some new members could not understand <br />the intricacies ... there was some discomfort."</p>
<p>Also, it was painful to hear from a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  member who is in close <br />friends circle that 'because of Ram's questions only, members lost <br />interest in proceeding further and not co-operating to materialize <br />anything from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym '.</p>
<p>Another statement from a member who didn't participate in the trip. <br />We don't know whether to laugh or worry. 'That was ponniyin selvan <br />tour. Varalaaru team unnecessarily involved history and spoiled the <br />mood of the trip'. If so, why was Dr. Kudavoil Balu invited? Did he <br />explain how did kalki write <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym ?</p>
<p>I am asking the following questions to all <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members.</p>
<p>Dear all <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members,</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let us assume that we had hassled Dr. <br />Kudavoil Balu. But, because of that, </p>
<p>Why should <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members get demoralised? Do you expect us not to ask <br />any questions? Where is the research without asking questions? Can <br />any student learn the subject properly without asking questions? If <br />SPS hadn't asked me and Lavanya the question 'Is Ravidasan real or <br />fictitious?' on 28th Jan 2003, what would we be doing now? Do you <br />think whatever scholars say have to be accepted without cross <br />verifying? Does cross verification mean insulting or questioning the <br />credibility of the scholar? Then what is the need of question time <br />in the conferences after presentation of each paper? Didn't <br />varalaaru team face such difference of opinions surfacing in open? <br />Wasn't the article presented by me and Pavithra in the Tamilnadu <br />history congress conference torn into pieces by scholars? Weren't <br />their questions answered patiently by us? Did we get demotivated <br />because of that? Didn't we co-operate to bring out varalaaru.com <br />after that? Do you think 2 years journey of varalaaru.com was a cake <br />walk? Did we bring out 400 articles just like that without any <br />struggle? How can things like big temple be achieved if just one <br />incident demotivates you all?</acronym></p>
<p>Since couple of our discussions with Dr.Kudavoil Balu were visible <br />to some members, above conclusion was reached. What would have <br />happened if our meetings with Dr.Rajavelu, Iravadham Mahadevan, <br />Michael Lockwood, and Dr.K.Rajan etc were seen? We would not be <br />surprised even by the comment like 'because of varalaaru team only, <br />flow of mails is less in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group'. Though we couldn't control, me <br />and Ram refrained ourselves from asking any question to <br />Mr.S.Ramachandran in T.Nagar meeting regarding his speech about <br />letters in the inscriptions. Otherwise, it would have been possible <br />to hear comment like 'because of me and Ram only, not many members <br />enrolled for inscriptions reading course'.</acronym></p>
<p>This is also one of the reasons why we don't inform the group about <br />our trips. Many members expressed their interest to participate in <br />our trips and asked to inform in advance. We also thought of doing <br />so. But after seeing these things, we changed our mind to avoid such <br />unnecessary comments. Apologies to those who were interested.</p>
<p>Varalaaru team always wanted to help <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  in all possible ways. It <br />is your responsibility or interest to ask what you need from us or <br />what do you want us to do. If you really feel that we are thorn in <br />the flesh, it is not so difficult to sideline or avoid 5 of us and <br />make things happen and continue the great work.</acronym></p>
<p>Hope you all understand what I tried to say. Though some names are <br />mentioned explicitly, no personal offense is meant.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />Kamal</p>

          Some clarifications ...        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Thank you Swetha for the clarification.</p>
<p>So far, we were groping in dark since we didnt have any clue on what <br />made trip members to think like that. Now, we understood the reason <br />and feel relieved that we didnt do anything to insult the scholar. I <br />feel sorry as my words made some of the trip members to feel upset.</p>
<p>Dear SB Sir,</p>
<blockquote><p>  For us, you and me included, really<br />  interested in knowing the Truth,<br />  whatever we discuss will look alright<br />  including expressions of because we<br />  meet and express things quite often.<br />  But for new comers - such differences<br />  may appear as if there is division.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes. I agree with you that the new comers won't understand because <br />of lack of exposure to us and our interactions with scholars like <br />Dr.Balu and Dr.Kalaikkovan. But why should this cause discomfort? If <br />it is not me, you and ram, it will be some other tom, dick and <br />harry, who will ask them such questions tomorrow, if not today. I <br />leave it here. You know better.</p>
<blockquote><p>  ALL SAID AND DONE the ONLY AND<br />  THE ONLY KAMAL CAN ORGANISE<br />  SUCH TRIP FLAWLESSLY. WE WILL<br />  REQUEST HIM TO NOTIFY HIS CONVINIENCE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the appreciation. But if you wait for me, it may not <br />happen immediately. Even if i visit india in near future, it would <br />be just 1 week or 10 days. Moreover, dont want to carry titles <br />like 'people of insecured feeling' by someone again. There are <br />members like satish, chandra and madan who already did some travel <br />and place arrangements. And members like Tholliyal thurai Sriraman <br />and Thirumurai thiruthalangkalil karai kanda Venkatesh are there to <br />guide. What else can we do more than this?</p>
<p>Thanks<br />Kamal</p>

        <p>-thank you swetha for clearing this</p>
<p>some people may know about history but they know the least about <br />respecting age and experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>the comments that were made by people who have perhaps entered this <br />big temple only in the last five years or so and comments were made on <br />a man whose lifetime work this was.</p>
<p>I basically think this stems out of a feeling of insecurity rather <br />than knowledge.</p>
<p>regards<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  I have been really tied up at office and that is why I was unable to <br />  reply to this mail or the thread in the group.</p>
<p>  I feel this discussion itself is uncalled for. Why such a thread all <br />  of a sudden?</p>
<p>  Let me tell what I felt in the temple. It was BAD. A senior person <br />is <br />  passionately talking abt one of his lifetime works and ppl pass some <br />  uncharitable comments... Is this correct?</p>
<p>  The comments that were aired included 'MGR cinema is going on'. And <br />  when he was describing the RWH system near the Chandikeswarar shrine <br />  a comment 'All this is peela, such structures exist in all temples' <br />  was made.</p>
<p>  I accept that there will always exist differences of opinion. What I <br />  accept, you needn't accept. But that does not give any of us the <br />  right to ridicule people who have a different opinion.</p>

<p>I completely agree with u..it wud be great to have a trip like that starting from veeranam..i wud like to go along with the stalwarts in this group..I dont think it is possible now, considering the pressures, our members will be facing , in the working environment..but atleast, we can give it a start, so that it may become conclusive , in the months to come..</p>

<p>Ponniyin selvan - the book and the character both are intoxicating. </p>
<p>We did get puzzled as to the differing opinions on various issues. We <br />understood it as the "regular" thing when many intellectuals try to <br />work together!</p>
<p>The Thanjavur trip did open up the floodgates of friendship, love and <br />respect amongst all of us. Each one in the team was so enthusiastic, <br />passionate and wanting to know more. Each one is in touch with all <br />others through the group and also through personal mails. The love for <br />history, especially our South Indian history is kindled in all the <br />group members. Should we not consider that a success? Most of us are <br />going beyond the literature and trying to learn history. </p>
<p>Why dont we all patch it up with a trip to Ponniyinselvan places <br />sometime soon? Starting from Veeranarayana Eeri, Kadambur and going <br />through the places our dear Vandiya Thevan travelled and end the trip <br />at Thanjavur?? We can top it with a visit to Thanjavur and Chennai <br />Museums.</p>
<p>I just bought a copy of "The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian <br />History, Culture and Identity" by Amartya Sen. - Yes, we are <br />argumentative and that is the best part of our tradition?? Isn't it? <br />Even Upanishads have Kenopanishad where a student keeps questioning <br />his teacher. Let us argue, question ( may be accept sometimes) and <br />enjoy the whole process.</p>
<p>How is this book by Amartya Sen? Anyone finished reading it?</p>

<p>8. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru team</p>
<p>I think this is the most important thing to be clarified. Because, <br />we are directly blamed here. Couldn't believe when we read the <br />following lines from SPS's mail. Immediately thought of asking 'You <br />too SB sir?'.</p>
<p>"Last year by this time we visited Thanjai ... we were thrilled to <br />go... after returning as Vencat rightly observed of various schools <br />of thoughts surfaced in OPEN some new members could not understand <br />the intricacies ... there was some discomfort."<br />=========================</p>
<p>Dear Kamal, <br />Thanks for complimenting me in earlier mail. Felt Happy!<br />Now criticising .. Unhappy ?! No .. Nice that you sought<br />clarification. Thanks for providing the opportunity:</p>
<p>Main Word is "OPEN " in my message ..</p>
<p>For us, you and me included, really interested in knowing the Truth,<br />whatever we discuss will look alright including expressions of<br />opposite stands.. because we meet and express things quite often. But<br />for new comers - including such of those who flew from as far place<br />from Mumbai and enrolled membersship in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  to join the tour - such<br />differences may appear as if there is division.</acronym></p>
<p>I recall onething in the trip : <br />Just then we were enchanted by the Architecture marvel.. we were<br />thrilled by 81 dance postures .. <br />Kamal and Ram did the explaining of the paintings to our group  </p>
<p>" People may think it is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and his Queens .. There is no conclusive<br />evidence ..<br />People may think this is Karuvurar and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , there is no conclusive<br />evidence ..<br />Some of the members opined it is likely to be <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  .."</p>
<p>I would have preferred <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  guide to do his <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  and then we share our<br />views ... I meant this when I put the word OPEN. I do not regret Dear<br />Kamal... Nobody's view - Dr. Nagaswamy - Dr. Kudavoil - Dr. Kvn or <br />Dr. Rjvelu 's view is conclusive on this because nothing is supported<br />by any inscriptional evidence..</acronym></p>
<p>In ground level, Ram asked me it may be Kulothunga also .. !  </p>
<p>You yourself gracefully admit that we are all students .. not Scholars .. </p>
<p>That is why we have to discuss among ourselves before bringing out<br />things with the scholars ....</p>
<p>Beyond this I want to put the Lakshman Rekha ..for myself.</p>
<p>But there are interesting issues :</p>
<p>1. Was it <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  or not ? I vote for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  because in the opposite side<br />wall painting similar looking person is sitting in devotion in front<br />of Peruvudyar. Cheramanperumal is out of the list.</acronym></p>
<p>2. Was it Sanakadhi munivars .. In the book (1973) Themizhaga koir<br />kalaigal, Dr. Nagaswamy observed that they were Karuvurar and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . Now<br />they are viewed as Sanakaadhi munivars by him, Dr Kudavoil and Dr Kkvn<br />included...</acronym></p>
<p>My view is : In <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's life there are three impt segments :</p>
<p>i. ARUMOZHI : Pre 985 - Ponniyinselvan - Darling of Chozha crowd<br />ii. RAJARAJAN : 985 - 1006 AD . Commencing Big temple construction.<br />More as a Wattior.. King of Kings .. 1006 to 1010 Transition to<br />Sivapathasekaran.</p>
<p>iii. SIVA PATHASEKARAN 1010 - 1014?<br />This is a crucial period .. </p>
<p>We are discussing of " .. Ezhundaruliya thirumundril .. " "<br />Periyadevar ..Godification. " etc. In this process, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  might have<br />preferred to be identified more as a Sivanadiyar .. His grant to<br />Thiruchengottangudi - Seeradevar etc., are all need to be studied in<br />detail apart from Thiruvisalur - Thiruvalanchuzhi - Papanasam<br />inscriptions .</acronym></p>
<p>I think Kalki also thought of this and introduces Mahendra as<br />Sivanadiyar (apart from conversion from Jain to Sivam ) in Sivakamiyin<br />Sabadam .. </p>
<p>Therefore I opine the person with Beard might be <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and the person<br />with Royal illumination in face might have been Rajendra - both SIVA<br />PAATHA SEKARAN and SIVA SARANA SEKARAN would have considered<br />themselves as the Disciples of Dakshinamurthy or so they Artists<br />depicted them.</acronym></p>
<p>It is purely my view ..but the Paintings might have been from Rajendra<br />period - prior to <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  in memory of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ! </p>
<p>Expecting more to hear ..</p>
<p>Re other points I prefer to go under the rug..</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Friends,</p>
<p>First of all Congrrats Varalaaru team.</p>
<p>An article in last issue reached many and its bought up many valuable discussions here, so our varalaaru .com is a gr8 sucess, keep up the good work.</p>
<p>Venkatesh/Satish</p>
<p>Its as simple as , our varalaaru team having Dr.Kalikovan as their master, nothing wrong it, thier views with Dr.Kudavayil diff many times , we have seen. Its all based thier approach towards history.Let me put it like this Dr.Kudavayil balu has a style of taking history to common man, so his style and his finding may differ from others, thats dosen't mean that any of us under grading him.</p>
<p>Kamal</p>
<p>Really its a big mail.anyhow my name is also mentioned in ur mail , i feel i have to explain my views in that :</p>
<p>Regarding Buddha and Rajaraja photos</p>
<p>Pls take it lightly a sort of fun, in the middle of hard subject.We every one knows that</p>
<p>2. Rajaraja and Karuvoor thevar painting</p>
<p>As i have told earlier Karuvoor thevar is not a single person, may be that even been a title given as like Viyasar, but sure <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  's guru is not Karuvoor thevar, Guru is "Eesana siva pandithar" .</p>
<p>3.Dr.Kalaikkovan magudaagamam-nu onnu illave illangararu</p>
<p>Dr.Kalaikovan in his article saying that he wants a read that magudaagamam, and now we r in the process of finding that book, sure we can come back with better result in coming days. Let us wait for sometime in this pls, really its a good input and we can have some interesting inputs.</p>
<p>4. Varalaaru article claims that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's life was very well documented</p>
<p>Yes <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  achivements well documented, accept still there are so many questions left, let us take it like this " May be <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  is keen on documenting his achivements and not his personal life" may be thats y we have left out with questions like " what he did in between 969 to 985 , and how and where he died and all.</p>
<p>But Kamal you could have posted this better way - sorry kamal</p>
<p>a. Person worshipping Nataraja</p>
<p>Its a long pending question, even i too remember i have asked the same to Dr.Kalaikovan in Rajarajeswaram and his reply" could be" even Gokul perosnally accepted that it should be only <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym , the point we need to take up here is , that painting are fresco, and panel need to be completed in set few hrs. We can think like this " as a great person <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  buliding that temple , we can feel that it should be only <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym " </p>
<p>But friends we have no evidence, we can feel and belive that all.</p>
<p>8. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru <br />team</acronym></p>
<p>NO , i am not accepting that, <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  is the second line team of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group , which is require lot of support and inputs for First line Varalaaru team.</p>
<p>Let the questions come, by that way only we can understand the history, views may diff, discussion will go , i feel thats all require, we all r matured persons, been together on subject interest, we need questions , may be the questions from few like me on basic things , but our first line team responded postively , and the qestions from them giving us new lights, so let us welcome and <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  NEVER GOT DEMOTIVATED and its welcomes the questions and open discussion as a subject matter. </p>
<p>Regards<br />Shankaran</p>
<p>"S.Kamalakkannan" <adhitha_karikalan@yahoo.com  wrote:<br />Dear Venkatesh and Satish,</adhitha_karikalan@yahoo.com></p>
<p>Thanks for your mails. We requested to notify our mistakes in the <br />past. You did it. This helps us to correct ourselves.</p>
<p>Dear VK and Shankaran,</p>
<p>That is the right attitude towards finding truth. Keep it up.</p>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Since, there were some discussions and finger pointing based on an <br />article published in our varlaaru.com, we feel it is our <br />responsibility to explain. So, I take this opportunity to clarify <br />certain things happening for past 1 year on behalf of varalaaru team.</p>
<p>1. Regarding Buddha and Rajaraja photos</p>
<p>When we made trip to thanjavur and pazhaiyaarai last year by this <br />time, some of us accepted that the person in thanjavur painting was <br />Rajaraja and the person in panchavan madhevi pallippadai was <br />Rajendra based on the location and 'who else it could be' basis. But <br />for some of us, it was not convincing proof. So, i just wanted to <br />let them understand what all they have to accept if they start <br />accepting without considering other negative evidences. So, I posted <br />a picture of Buddha statue with chakra mark in it. As Rajaraja also <br />had sangu chakra rekhai in his palms according to Thiruvalangadu <br />copper plates, i told it has to be considered as Rajaraja. People <br />started disproving the statement and gave valid points why it cannot <br />be Rajaraja. I was happy and hoped that people would apply the same <br />rules for the issues raised during the trip too. So, I ended the <br />drama with explanation of my actual intention.</p>
<p>Swetha oru dheerkka dharisi. Her words</p>
<p>"Kamal, neenga Japan ponalum intha pavam ungalai uruthu vanthu <br />oottum!"</p>
<p>has become true now. I have changed the description of the pictures. <br />So, new members won't get misguided.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>2. Rajaraja and Karuvoor thevar painting</p>
<p>It was told that the young man and old man in thanjavur painting <br />were Rajaraja and his spiritual guru Karuvoor thevar. But from <br />inscriptions of Rajarajeswaram, we knew that Rajaraja's guru <br />was 'Eesana siva pandithar' and not Karuvoor thevar. Karuvoor thevar <br />was not mentioned in any of Rajaraja period inscriptions. It clearly <br />proves that there was no relationship between Rajaraja and <br />Karuvooraar even if a person by name Karuvoor thevar lived during <br />that period. Thiruvisaippaa was quoted for proof. When i went <br />through that, i misunderstood Thirubhuvanam with Thiru poovanam. <br />When Venkatesh notified that, I couldn't reply immediately as i <br />became busy at work and some personal commitments. After that, new <br />threads were started and i forgot to reply to that. Anyway, I accept <br />that it was my mistake.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>3. Dr.Kalaikkovan magudaagamam-nu onnu illave illangararu.</p>
<p>Satish wrote this in his reply to Venkateswaran Kasirajan last week. <br />At first, SPS introduced Dr.Kudavoil Balu to varalaaru.com team <br />during mid 2004. Then, varalaaru team met Dr.Balu during December <br />2004 and early January 2005 while bringing special issue for <br />Rajarajeswaram. In all these three meetings, Dr.Balu mentioned that <br />Periya koyil was built based on Magudagamam concept. We requested <br />him to show the book. At that time, he said it is in Sanskrit. As of <br />now, in tamilnadu, only his guru Dr.Nagasamy can read and understand <br />that and even he himself cannot read it. When we met Dr.Kalaikkovan <br />on 26th January in Trichy as part of our 5 days mega trip, we asked <br />if he knows anything about Magudagamam. He said he also heard it <br />from Dr.Balu only during Big temple Kudamuzhukku around 10 years <br />ago. At that time itself he asked but couldn't see the book till <br />date. Whenever we discussed with Dr.Kalaikkovan about magudagamam <br />concept, he never told that it doesn't exist. He always told that he <br />hasn't seen it yet. Satish joined us in one or two trips during the <br />thiruvalanjuzhi research. At that time, we are not sure if <br />Dr.Kalaikkovan told satish like this. Satish only knows. In his <br />article also, he didn't mention that it does not exist. He just <br />wanted to see it.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>4. Varalaaru article claims that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's life was very well documented</p>
<p>Venkatesh raised this point in his reply to Satish's mail and he <br />tried to disprove saying "then why are we groping in the dark about <br />most of the details of his life and death?". I don't think anywhere <br />in the article it is mentioned that all the events in his life were <br />very well documented. It says only his significant achievements were <br />documented. Though unusually Rajaraja documented extensively, we <br />cannot expect him to mention when did he catch cold, how many times <br />he sneezed and all. I request to read the articles properly before <br />making such sweeping statements.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>5. Who else it could be? Rajaraja and Rajasimma</p>
<p>In his second mail to VK, Satish quoted that when Dr.Kalaikkovan <br />said that the statue of a king in Dharmaraja radham is Rajasimma <br />on 'who else it could be' basis, we accepted. In the same way, when <br />he said that painting in periya koyil is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  on the same basis, we <br />didn't accept. With this, he came to a conclusion that <br />Dr.Kalaikkovan accepts assumptions indirectly.</acronym></p>
<p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>Do you really think both 'Who else it could be' are same? I am not <br />sure if you have read the book 'Adhyandha kaamam' completely. <br />Otherwise, you wouldn't have raised this point. I give the summary <br />of points considered before concluding it is Rajasimma. If you are <br />not convinced still, it is my inability to explain as I don't have <br />the book with me right now and please go through the book.</p>
<p>Labeled Royal Portraits are usually met with only on prominent parts <br />of the temple such as the walls or the niches. You may refer to <br />Mahavaraaha temple at Mamallapuram and several other temples in the <br />cholamandalam (Thiruvaavaduthurai, Thiruvisaloor, Konerirajapuram, <br />etc). Dr. Kudavoil Balu himself has mentioned a few such labeled <br />portraits carved on the walls of the temple towers at Chidambaram in <br />his book entitled 'Goburakkalai marabu'.</p>
<p>Though labeled portrait sculptures are detected so far in the greeva <br />naasikaas or koodu in the kapodha, male figures worshipping linga <br />are depicted in many temples. Thiruvalanjuzhi is a good example <br />where one can identify many such figures. Don't you think that one <br />should take much care before identifying a figure as a particular <br />royal person? Is this not his duty to provide enough evidences to <br />substantiate such identity before it is questioned?</p>
<p>In the case of adhyandha kaamam, the creator of the temple was <br />identified after a thorough analysis of its architecture, iconology <br />and epigraphic records. This and the titles (Srimega, Sri Trilokya <br />vardhana and Vidhi) engraved on the niche where the sculpture is <br />placed, helped to confirm the portrait figure as Rajasimma.</p>
<p>Ram is translating the chapter 'Nizhalum Nijamum' from the <br />book 'Adhyandha kaamam' as Dr. Michael Lockwood asked for the <br />English version. We will send it soon.</p>
<p>Now, let us see the case of rajarajeswaram. In the saanthaaram <br />paintings, two persons are said to be Rajaraja.</p>
<p>a. Person worshipping Nataraja</p>
<p>Appearance of the person worshipping Nataraja has no dissimilarities <br />with Cheraman peruman naayanar portrayed in Sundarar panel. Cheraman <br />peruman was also a king. We cannot say only Rajaraja worshipped <br />Nataraja. So, it can be any king. All we can say is one king is <br />portrayed. That's all. 'Who else it could be' argument is <br />inappropriate here. We know for sure that two persons in other side <br />panel is Sundarar and Cheraman because we know the theme behind it <br />and other pieces of paintings in that panel are also supporting <br />this. This worshipping panel may also have some theme behind it. <br />Unless a complete study like 'Adhyandha kaamam' is carried out, we <br />cannot say who is who. Not only panel, which has that person, entire <br />panel in the wall has to be studied properly without any <br />preconceived notion. Even when the well known sundarar panel was <br />studied by Dr.Kalaikkovan, we encountered lot of stunning details. <br />They are going to be published in his book 'Vaanan vandhu vazhi <br />thandhu' shortly.</p>
<p>b. Young man and old man</p>
<p>The two persons are said to be Rajaraja and his guru karuvoor <br />thevar. Already it is proved that there is no relationship between <br />these two. The attire and hairstyle doesn't match with a king. <br />Moreover, Dr.Kudavoil Balu proved that they are 'Sanakaadhi <br />munivargal'. I am not sure if he has written any article on this. <br />But when varalaaru team met him in thanjavur for second or third <br />time, he explained how he concluded that they are sanakaadhi <br />munivargal. All his points were very much valid and acceptable. You <br />can ask him when you meet next time.</p>
<p>So, from this, we can conclude that both cannot be said to be <br />Rajaraja and both 'who else it could be' are not same.</p>
<p>Here, i would like to have a disclaimer. We are in the beginning <br />stage of learning historical research methodologies and subject. Our <br />explanation capabilities are limited. So, please do not go by our <br />statements which are not complete or quoted in different scenario. <br />When you encounter such things, please look at the source or ask for <br />more explanation. Because, already such confusion occurred in the <br />past regarding podhikai. In Pullamangai and Thiruvalanjuzhi, we had <br />less time and had lot of things to see other than podhikai. So, I <br />couldn't explain well. In that case, consulting the articles of <br />Kattadakkalai series would be helpful. Hope you understand my point.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>6. School of thought and ego clash</p>
<p>Venkatesh used to mention about "School of thought" in couple of his <br />mails in the sense we are adherents of Dr.Kalaikkovan's school of <br />thought. So, we hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu during his talk in tanjore. <br />I really don't understand where the scope for school of thought is <br />in the current scenario.</p>
<p>Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Which one do you mean by 'School of thought' here? If you <br />say 'Rajaraja was ego-centric person. So, he might have projected <br />him somewhere in his masterpiece temple', that is school of thought. <br />If you say 'Tholkappiyam has words like 'enmanaar pulavar'. So it <br />may belong to 7th century AD', that is school of thought. If you <br />say 'Thirukkural uses some of Jainism concepts. So, thiruvalluvar <br />may be a Jain', that is school of thought. But how can Magudagamam <br />and pon vimaanam concept be considered as School of thought when we <br />have evidences to disprove the role of Magudagamam in big temple?</p>
<p>And you said 'at last the clash of the egos has come to the <br />forefront'. It is not so. As i stated in the point 3, this issue was <br />brought out around 10 years before when the reference of magudagamam <br />was first quoted in Big temple Kumbabishekam malar. Many scholars <br />witnessed this. What do you mean by 'behind the scene and proxy <br />squabbling'? What is the necessity for us to hide and fight? Didn't <br />we ask these questions directly to Dr.Kudavoil Balu? If our <br />questions were answered already, why are we asking again and again? <br />Moreover, none of our questions are unanswerable during our times or <br />as difficult as finding Tutankhamen tomb.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>7. Varalaaru team hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu</p>
<p>Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>In the same mail, you said 'so many times we have all discussed how <br />Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled'. I frankly say that till this point <br />of time, we really don't understand how did we hassle him. You told <br />many times that we hassled him. But never told how. Even when Ram <br />asked you directly in the beach meeting, it was not responded <br />properly and topic got diverted. You said 'not only me. All of us <br />felt like that'. When I checked with some of the members, they said <br />they didn't think that Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled. I already <br />explained in the earlier messages. I am repeating here. Till this <br />date, varalaaru team is in good relationship with Dr.Kudavoil Balu. <br />We met couple of times even after our tanjore trip. If we are not <br />respecting him, why should we bring special issue on him? Why should <br />he allow us to publish his articles in guest section? Why should we <br />meet him again when we went to thanjavur? And I used to hear offline <br />comments like whatever Dr. Kudavoil Balu says, varalaaru team <br />doesn't accept. It is not true. When he says anything with proper <br />supportive evidences, we always accepted them. Best example is the <br />Sanakaadhi munivargal in the painting. If we oppose him blindly, why <br />should we accept this?</p>
<p>Satish may know that we ask many questions before accepting any info <br />told by even Dr.Kalaikkovan. How can cross verification be <br />considered as hassling? Dr.Balu is a well experienced scholar in the <br />field of epigraphy. His hard work cannot be discarded by anyone. <br />Already we asked him these questions we have asked here. He would <br />have faced lot of such questions from scholars like Subbarayalu as <br />well as beginners like us. He knows how to handle it. In spite of <br />all these, if you still want to believe that he was hassled, well, <br />go ahead. We don't have any objections.</p>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p>8. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru <br />team</acronym></p>
<p>I think this is the most important thing to be clarified. Because, <br />we are directly blamed here. Couldn't believe when we read the <br />following lines from SPS's mail. Immediately thought of asking 'You <br />too SB sir?'.</p>
<p>"Last year by this time we visited Thanjai ... we were thrilled to <br />go... after returning as Vencat rightly observed of various schools <br />of thoughts surfaced in open, some new members could not understand <br />the intricacies ... there was some discomfort."</p>
<p>Also, it was painful to hear from a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  member who is in close <br />friends circle that 'because of Ram's questions only, members lost <br />interest in proceeding further and not co-operating to materialize <br />anything from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym '.</p>
<p>Another statement from a member who didn't participate in the trip. <br />We don't know whether to laugh or worry. 'That was ponniyin selvan <br />tour. Varalaaru team unnecessarily involved history and spoiled the <br />mood of the trip'. If so, why was Dr. Kudavoil Balu invited? Did he <br />explain how did kalki write <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym ?</p>
<p>I am asking the following questions to all <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members.</p>
<p>Dear all <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members,</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let us assume that we had hassled Dr. <br />Kudavoil Balu. But, because of that, </p>
<p>Why should <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  members get demoralised? Do you expect us not to ask <br />any questions? Where is the research without asking questions? Can <br />any student learn the subject properly without asking questions? If <br />SPS hadn't asked me and Lavanya the question 'Is Ravidasan real or <br />fictitious?' on 28th Jan 2003, what would we be doing now? Do you <br />think whatever scholars say have to be accepted without cross <br />verifying? Does cross verification mean insulting or questioning the <br />credibility of the scholar? Then what is the need of question time <br />in the conferences after presentation of each paper? Didn't <br />varalaaru team face such difference of opinions surfacing in open? <br />Wasn't the article presented by me and Pavithra in the Tamilnadu <br />history congress conference torn into pieces by scholars? Weren't <br />their questions answered patiently by us? Did we get demotivated <br />because of that? Didn't we co-operate to bring out varalaaru.com <br />after that? Do you think 2 years journey of varalaaru.com was a cake <br />walk? Did we bring out 400 articles just like that without any <br />struggle? How can things like big temple be achieved if just one <br />incident demotivates you all?</acronym></p>
<p>Since couple of our discussions with Dr.Kudavoil Balu were visible <br />to some members, above conclusion was reached. What would have <br />happened if our meetings with Dr.Rajavelu, Iravadham Mahadevan, <br />Michael Lockwood, and Dr.K.Rajan etc were seen? We would not be <br />surprised even by the comment like 'because of varalaaru team only, <br />flow of mails is less in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group'. Though we couldn't control, me <br />and Ram refrained ourselves from asking any question to <br />Mr.S.Ramachandran in T.Nagar meeting regarding his speech about <br />letters in the inscriptions. Otherwise, it would have been possible <br />to hear comment like 'because of me and Ram only, not many members <br />enrolled for inscriptions reading course'.</acronym></p>
<p>This is also one of the reasons why we don't inform the group about <br />our trips. Many members expressed their interest to participate in <br />our trips and asked to inform in advance. We also thought of doing <br />so. But after seeing these things, we changed our mind to avoid such <br />unnecessary comments. Apologies to those who were interested.</p>
<p>Varalaaru team always wanted to help <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  in all possible ways. It <br />is your responsibility or interest to ask what you need from us or <br />what do you want us to do. If you really feel that we are thorn in <br />the flesh, it is not so difficult to sideline or avoid 5 of us and <br />make things happen and continue the great work.</acronym></p>
<p>Hope you all understand what I tried to say. Though some names are <br />mentioned explicitly, no personal offense is meant.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />Kamal</p>

<p>Hi kamal.</p>
<p>pretty long mail eh?</p>
<p>but I still stick to my stand.</p>
<p>and it reminded me of a very apt and cute description</p>
<p>IN THE LAND OF THE BLIND THE ONE EYED MAN IS THE KING</p>
<p>Karuvoor thevar </p>
<blockquote><p>  was not mentioned in any of Rajaraja period inscriptions.<br />It clearly <br />  proves that there was no relationship between Rajaraja and <br />  Karuvooraar even if a person by name Karuvoor thevar lived during <br />  that period. </p></blockquote>
<p>if something is not mentioned in rrc kalvettu then it never happened?</p>
<p>it PROVES nothing. nothing at all</p>
<p>the only song of rajarajeshwaram is by karuvooraar and that is <br />accepted when the thirumurais were codified in 13- 14th centuries.</p>
<p>sticking only to epigraphy is a dark alley especially in tamilnadu <br />where in comparison to other dynasties of the same time history was <br />not recorded properly. wherever it was it was a mostly sychophancy of <br />the highest order.<br />other sources of history have to be examined just like the <br />thirubuvanam thirupoovanam episode.</p></abhivencat@yahoo.com></p>
<blockquote><p>  Venkatesh raised this point in his reply to Satish's mail and he <br />  tried to disprove saying "then why are we groping in the dark about <br />  most of the details of his life and death?". I don't think anywhere <br />  in the article it is mentioned that all the events in his life were <br />  very well documented. </p></blockquote>
<p>and please read kkvns article once more. the last but one paragraph <br />starts with the extreme documentation of rrc and rjc's period.</p>
<p>and why should I spread insinuations against you or ram for that <br />matter. I am not aspiring to be an archeologist as others do.</p>
<p>Even when Ram </p>
<blockquote><p>  asked you directly in the beach meeting, it was not responded <br />  properly and topic got diverted. You said 'not only me. All of us <br />  felt like that'. When I checked with some of the members, they said <br />  they didn't think that Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled. </p></blockquote>
<p>did you ask swetha</p>
<p>shall I quote your exact words here in which you described kudavoil's <br />lecture to the group.<br />if you want to refresh your memory dear kamal ask swetha.</p>
<p>also look at the mails which came soon after the tanjore trip</p>
<p>one thing kamal</p>
<p>some people seem to think that kkvn and kudavoil are the only two <br />people involved in chola history. there are hundreds who have a <br />personal involvement over decades.</p>
<p>there can be other schools of thought( i use the word again) other <br />than these two people. just dont think that if we are not adherents to <br />one of the two we follow the other.</p></acronym></p>
<blockquote><p>  8. PSVP members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru <br />  team</p>
<p>  kamal out of the 600 members in the group or the 40 members in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  <br />how many are really interested in epigraphy.</acronym></p></blockquote>
<p>I for one dont give it a damn.there are enough sources of history and <br />other than that and there is more to history than just cholas or <br />tamils.</p>
<p>how many are even going to read my mail or yours completely.</p>
<p>we are a drop in the ocean kamal and neither can we motivate or <br />demoralise anybody for long</p>

          Some clarifications ...        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Kamal,</p>
<p>Quite a long mail. Took a long time for me to read. All your points <br />are very much valid. I am bound to reply, because my name was openly <br />quoted many a times.</p>
<p>First things first, I am a very poor reader, second, I have a very <br />poor retention power. So even if I had read the books you quoted, i <br />dont realize the points. Third, I am not a great scholor in any <br />subject and I dont have even the basic knowledge to question on many <br />of the points you raise. I am just like any other common man, who <br />has a passion for history but not as high as yours. YOu people are <br />becoming experts and proven writers, but I am not. So many of my <br />words would have been on the cream and not in depth.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Dear Venkatesh and Satish,</p>
<p>  1. Regarding Buddha and Rajaraja photos</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry to say, this was a real mockery which took everyone aback. <br />Your intentions might be good, but the way it was presented was not <br />good. Lets admit that.</p>
<blockquote><p>  *****************************************</p>
<p>  3. Dr.Kalaikkovan magudaagamam-nu onnu illave illangararu.</p></blockquote>
<p>Any common man like me will decipher this only as I quoted. On the <br />surface, it looks like saying it doesnt exisit. As I said, I am not <br />a scholar to understand such nuances of the article and its my <br />mistake. Apologies.</p>
<blockquote><p>  5. Who else it could be? Rajaraja and Rajasimma</p></blockquote>
<p>Again the above point holds good. For a common man like me same <br />logic holds good. Probably, if just a gist about the difference was <br />given to me or anyone like me, even an one liner, as you <br />said, 'Adyantha kamam deals with this', it would have made a <br />difference, rather than brushing aside the topic with a giggle.</p>
<blockquote><p>  *****************************************</p>
<p>  6. School of thought and ego clash<br />  7. Varalaaru team hassled Dr.Kudavoil Balu</p></blockquote>
<p>I dont even remember what Venkatesh claims or swetha says, or for <br />that matter I even dont know what was said on that day, one thing is <br />fresh in my memory even now. Do you remember my question to you all, <br />I mean ALL, on the very first day of the first trip I came with you? <br />It was 29 January, Sunday, evening, in the van, after a days trip <br />with Dr.Kudavoil - I was new to this arena and was just observing <br />what Dr.KB told and what you people questioned. THough much of that <br />didnt enter my blockhead, I asked you people, 'why do you laugh for <br />everything Dr.Balu says?'. Its the first impression everyone gets. <br />Only after a couple of visits with you and getting to know each one <br />personally, I could digest that point. </p>
<p>I am extremely sorry for bringing this up, but since I am quoted, I <br />am bound to respond. I was thinking that its only me who took it in <br />that sense, but later came to know that(after nearly 10 months) <br />everyone feels the same. Thats the first impression every one gets. <br />If I am pointed one time, it can be others mistake,if I am pointed <br />more than once, its my mistake.</p>
<blockquote><p>  8. PSVP members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru <br />  team</p></blockquote>
<p>Same as above. First impression is the best impression, it could be <br />wrong, but still you are making an impression, my friend. That makes <br />all the difference.</p>
<p>Kamal, Ram, Lavanya, Gokul and Krupa,</p>
<p>I think I am one of the very few fortunate (I think I can count the <br />numbers) people who know all five of you personally and I take the <br />pride of knowing you all. I share a very special friendship with you <br />all. Request you to contribute more and keep up the spirit of this <br />group alive for the coming years. One thing, this mail is good to <br />have put out everything openly. I always feel its better to pour <br />out rather than taking things personally to heart. </p>
<p>What the scholars say are above the heads of the common people like <br />me. Thats one of the main reason history is not appreciated by many. <br />You being in the younger age group can bridge this gap and make <br />things simple and interesting to all. As I commented for this months <br />varallaru.com, two years you have come a long way, get into the next <br />orbit and try to make things simpler and intersting to all. </p>
<p>As Venkatesh pointed, if anything more, lets take in the personal <br />mail chain.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish </p>

          Some clarifications ...        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi kamal.</p>
<p>pretty long mail eh?</p>
<p>but I still stick to my stand.</p>
<p>and it reminded me of a very apt and cute description</p>
<p>IN THE LAND OF THE BLIND THE ONE EYED MAN IS THE KING</p>
<p>Karuvoor thevar </p>
<blockquote><p>  was not mentioned in any of Rajaraja period inscriptions.<br />It clearly <br />  proves that there was no relationship between Rajaraja and <br />  Karuvooraar even if a person by name Karuvoor thevar lived during <br />  that period. </p></blockquote>
<p>if something is not mentioned in rrc kalvettu then it never happened?</p>
<p>it PROVES nothing. nothing at all</p>
<p>the only song of rajarajeshwaram is by karuvooraar and that is  <br />accepted when the thirumurais were codified in 13- 14th centuries.</p>
<p>sticking only to epigraphy is a dark alley especially in tamilnadu <br />where in comparison to other dynasties of the same time history was <br />not recorded properly. wherever it was it was a mostly sychophancy of <br />the highest order.<br />other sources of history have to be examined just like the <br />thirubuvanam thirupoovanam episode.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Venkatesh raised this point in his reply to Satish's mail and he <br />  tried to disprove saying "then why are we groping in the dark about <br />  most of the details of his life and death?". I don't think anywhere <br />  in the article it is mentioned that all the events in his life were <br />  very well documented. </p></blockquote>
<p>and please read kkvns article once more. the last but one paragraph <br />starts with the extreme documentation of rrc and rjc's period.</p>
<p>and why should I spread insinuations against you or ram for that <br />matter. I am not aspiring to be an archeologist as others do.</p>
<p>Even when Ram </p>
<blockquote><p>  asked you directly in the beach meeting, it was not responded <br />  properly and topic got diverted. You said 'not only me. All of us <br />  felt like that'. When I checked with some of the members, they said <br />  they didn't think that Dr. Kudavoil Balu was hassled. </p></blockquote>
<p>did you ask swetha</p>
<p>shall I quote your exact words here in which you described kudavoil's <br />lecture to the group.<br />if you want to refresh your memory dear kamal ask swetha.</p>
<p>also look at the mails which came soon after the tanjore trip</p>
<p>one thing kamal</p>
<p>some people seem to think that kkvn and kudavoil are the only two <br />people involved in chola history. there are hundreds who have a <br />personal involvement over decades.</p>
<p>there can be other schools of thought( i use the word again) other <br />than these two people. just dont think that if we are not adherents to <br />one of the two we follow the other.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  8. PSVP members got demotivated because of questions by varalaaru <br />  team</p>
<p>  kamal out of the 600 members in the group or the 40 members in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym   <br />how many are really interested in epigraphy.</acronym></p></blockquote>
<p>I for one dont give it a damn.there are enough sources of history and <br />other than that and there is more to history than just cholas or <br />tamils.</p>
<p>how many are even going to read my mail or yours completely.</p>
<p>we are a drop in the ocean kamal and neither can we motivate or <br />demoralise anybody for long</p>
<p>I think this issue is getting very personal and we should continue to <br />argue if need be only in the personal channel.</p>
<p>with warm regards<br />venketesh</p>
