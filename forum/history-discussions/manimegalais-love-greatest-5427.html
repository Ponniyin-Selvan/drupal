<p>Hi --</p>
<p>* Kundhavai's Love for VD</p>
<p>Kundhaivai's love is more of the kind where she was conscious of <br />what she was giving and what she was getting. But as a princess, she <br />has to be. When taking kundhavai's love for VD we need to consider a <br />lot of things. A princess of a big kingdom, who has been brought up <br />in such a set up, actually,<br />falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If you <br />look at the way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and <br />helps the love to grow between the two. Her spontaneity could be <br />because, she wanted to be in Chozha nadu and by falling in love with <br />a vagabond like VD, she needn't<br />have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th <br />bagam if I am right in PS that she loves Chozha nadu above anything <br />else in her life. She knows what she wants, what she is capable of <br />giving and for that what she can expect in return. She is pretty <br />clear. </p>
<p>* Vanathi's love for AM</p>
<p>She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have to <br />keep that in mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love <br />and she takes a wow that she will not sit on the throne as his patta <br />magishi(pm). As Ram aptly puts it, the wow was to silence people <br />like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />harping that she loves AM to be his pm. </p>
<p>* Manimekalai's love for VD</p>
<p>As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls in <br />love with VD from what her brother tells her about VD. Its like, she <br />loves her brother so much and this friendship between them (VD and <br />her brother) has been instrumental for the love to blossom. In the <br />end too, its because she<br />realizes that all that her brother had projected about VD is wrong <br />that she goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux situation <br />where she loves this guy but is unable to accept for her brother is <br />giving a conflicting version and then she realizes something else. <br />And in the end, everything<br />goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its <br />fate that plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do with <br />the love she has for VD. If she were to be convinced that VD has <br />done harm to her brother, I doubt she would have acted the way she <br />did. That's not in her character. </p>
<p>* Nandini's love for KK</p>
<p>Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic example <br />of leaf who is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants <br />as and when she wants to just satisfy her whims and fancies of that <br />moment. I doubt if she herself knows what she wants. She is not <br />clear. All she wants is power. In<br />the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using VD <br />seeing how strong his will is, but in the process somewhere she does <br />fall for VD. But in the end she ends up using this guy too as a <br />scape goat elsewhere. But she did have a lot of respect and <br />reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people <br />including Ravidasan. </p>
<p>* Mandhakini's love for SC</p>
<p>She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost his <br />way. So all she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that's <br />another love at first sight, which happened, when she tried saving <br />this guy from a bear. She is an exceptional person who loses memory <br />of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and <br />disappointment in life. But her love for one man in her life is <br />predominant above everything else. She lives for SC. She has no life <br />of herself. She keeps roaming around SC and his life and by her <br />extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life in <br />the process of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary <br />character who cant be compared to anyone else in the novel. Not can <br />you compare her love with anyone's for as I said, she did not live <br />her life for herself. Her life was<br />dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him. </p>
<p>* Poonguzhali's love for AM</p>
<p>This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She realized <br />that there was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />never get fulfilled. Instead, she realized that its better to <br />acknowledge the love that Sendhan Amudhan was showering on her. And <br />that was a wise decision both for<br />herself and for AM. </p>
<p>Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would say <br />it was Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And <br />she died in the process of saving his life. </p>
<p>But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give <br />(she too has plans for her life) and she is deciding things <br />accordingly and handling things accordingly. Here this woman is an <br />individual by herself and is clear in what she wants and what she <br />can give. She is not interested in going<br />about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste her <br />time on it. I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own <br />life happy rather than creating unhappiness for you and for your <br />beloved. That way, I would rate Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai <br />second. </p>
<p>I don't know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain Head <br />by Any Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a <br />particular place, that unless you know the meaning of 'I' in 'I love <br />you' you cannot understand what it actually means to love another <br />person. That way, I feel both<br />Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the 'I' well and <br />emphatically. </p>
<p>To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and both <br />you and your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love. <br />That way I feel the only sensible women of the novel were <br />Poonguzhali and Kundhavai. And both do not expect anything in return <br />for their love. They are happy and<br />they make their loved ones happy too. </p>
<p>My 5 cents :)</p>
<p>thanks,<br />Vidya. </p>

          MANIMEGALAI&#039;S LOVE IS GREATEST        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Nanbargaley,</p>
<p>Please forgive for delayed response. <br />No one will ever disagree that Megala's love is the<br />greatest, but that doesn't mean Kundavai does not have<br />gr8 love to Vandiya or AV forgot Vandiya. Think about<br />the situation. With a brother dead under mysterical<br />condiditions and another brother is framed against the<br />throne, kinsmen fighting each other and mainly the<br />effect that would arise if she meets Vandiya in that<br />situation. Similarly, AV was totally into the<br />political confusions. Instead of worrying mch about<br />his late brother, he was worrying about his nation<br />which would die if he haven't taken any steps. They<br />are not ordinary people, and their acts would have<br />effect all through out the nation. Hence they have to<br />think and move.</p>
<p>But Megala's love is like a devotion of a pure being<br />on god (as Kalki describes it, through vandiya in one<br />scene - 'Deivathin meedu veika vendiya patrai en<br />meedhu veithullal').Hence, like meera, she was ready<br />to give her life for Vandiya. Noone can compare two<br />persons in this world, then how can we compare their<br />love.</p>

<p>      Hi --</p>
<p>      * Kundhavai's Love for VD</p>
<p>      Kundhaivai's love is more of the kind where she<br />  was conscious of <br />      what she was giving and what she was getting.<br />  But as a princess, <br />    she <br />      has to be. When taking kundhavai's love for VD<br />  we need to <br />  consider <br />    a <br />      lot of things. A princess of a big kingdom, who<br />  has been brought <br />    up <br />      in such a set up, actually,<br />      falls in love at first sight, not knowing who<br />  this guy is. If <br />  you <br />      look at the way she responds to people, she<br />  actually nurtures <br />  and <br />      helps the love to grow between the two. Her<br />  spontaneity could be <br />      because, she wanted to be in Chozha nadu and by<br />  falling in love <br />    with <br />      a vagabond like VD, she needn't<br />      have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says<br />  somewhere in the 4th <br />      bagam if I am right in PS that she loves Chozha<br />  nadu above <br />    anything <br />      else in her life. She knows what she wants, what<br />  she is capable <br />  of <br />      giving and for that what she can expect in<br />  return. She is pretty <br />      clear. </p>
<p>      * Vanathi's love for AM</p>
<p>      She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not<br />  with AM. We have <br />  to <br />      keep that in mind. She is ready to go to any<br />  extreme for her <br />  love <br />      and she takes a wow that she will not sit on the<br />  throne as his <br />    patta <br />      magishi(pm). As Ram aptly puts it, the wow was<br />  to silence people <br />      like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />      harping that she loves AM to be his pm. </p>
<p>      * Manimekalai's love for VD</p>
<p>      As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She<br />  actually falls <br />  in <br />      love with VD from what her brother tells her<br />  about VD. Its like, <br />    she <br />      loves her brother so much and this friendship<br />  between them (VD <br />  and <br />      her brother) has been instrumental for the love<br />  to blossom. In <br />  the <br />      end too, its because she<br />      realizes that all that her brother had projected<br />  about VD is <br />  wrong <br />      that she goes head strong in saving him. She is<br />  in a crux <br />    situation <br />      where she loves this guy but is unable to accept<br />  for her brother <br />    is <br />      giving a conflicting version and then she<br />  realizes something <br />  else. <br />      And in the end, everything<br />      goes hay way for this poor girl and she is<br />  thrown <br />=== message truncated ===</p></srividya.ramaswami@></p></vj.episteme@></p></sps10142004@></p></bhuvana_sundaram11@></p></vj.episteme@...></p></blockquote>

<p>    As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls <br />in <br />    love with VD from what her brother tells her about VD. Its like, <br />  she <br />    loves her brother so much and this friendship between them (VD <br />and <br />    her brother) has been instrumental for the love to blossom. In <br />the <br />    end too, its because she<br />    realizes that all that her brother had projected about VD is <br />wrong <br />    that she goes head strong in saving him.

Its <br />    fate that plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do <br />  with <br />    the love she has for VD. If she were to be convinced that VD has <br />    done harm to her brother, I doubt she would have acted the way <br />she <br />    did. That's not in her character. </p>
<p>    * Nandini's love for KK</p>
<p>    Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic <br />example <br />    of leaf who is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she <br />wants <br />    as and when she wants to just satisfy her whims and fancies of <br />  that <br />    moment. I doubt if she herself knows what she wants. She is not <br />    clear. All she wants is power. In<br />    the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using VD <br />    seeing how strong his will is, but in the process somewhere she <br />  does <br />    fall for VD. But in the end she ends up using this guy too as a <br />    scape goat elsewhere. But she did have a lot of respect and <br />    reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />    again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people <br />    including Ravidasan. </p>
<p>    * Mandhakini's love for SC</p>
<p>    She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost <br />  his <br />    way. So all she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And <br />that's <br />    another love at first sight, which happened, when she tried <br />saving <br />    this guy from a bear. She is an exceptional person who loses <br />  memory <br />    of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />    around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and <br />    disappointment in life. But her love for one man in her life is <br />    predominant above everything else. She lives for SC. She has no <br />  life <br />    of herself. She keeps roaming around SC and his life and by her <br />    extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />    time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life <br />  in <br />    the process of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary <br />    character who cant be compared to anyone else in the novel. Not <br />  can <br />    you compare her love with anyone's for as I said, she did not <br />live <br />    her life for herself. Her life was<br />    dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him. </p>
<p>    * Poonguzhali's love for AM</p>
<p>    This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She <br />  realized <br />    that there was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />    never get fulfilled. Instead, she realized that its better to <br />    acknowledge the love that Sendhan Amudhan was showering on her. <br />  And <br />    that was a wise decision both for<br />    herself and for AM. </p>
<p>    Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would <br />say <br />    it was Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. <br />And <br />    she died in the process of saving his life. </p>
<p>    But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give <br />    (she too has plans for her life) and she is deciding things <br />    accordingly and handling things accordingly. Here this woman is <br />an <br />    individual by herself and is clear in what she wants and what <br />she <br />    can give. She is not interested in going<br />    about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste <br />  her <br />    time on it. I would say its being more intelligent to make ones <br />  own <br />    life happy rather than creating unhappiness for you and for your <br />    beloved. That way, I would rate Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai <br />    second. </p>
<p>    I don't know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain <br />  Head <br />    by Any Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at <br />a <br />    particular place, that unless you know the meaning of 'I' in 'I <br />  love <br />    you' you cannot understand what it actually means to love <br />another <br />    person. That way, I feel both<br />    Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the 'I' well and <br />    emphatically. </p>
<p>    To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and <br />  both <br />    you and your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that <br />love. <br />    That way I feel the only sensible women of the novel were <br />    Poonguzhali and Kundhavai. And both do not expect anything in <br />  return <br />    for their love. They are happy and<br />    they make their loved ones happy too. </p>
<p>    My 5 cents :)</p>
<p>    thanks,<br />    Vidya. </p>

<p>  Hi --</p>
<p>  * Kundhavai's Love for VD</p>
<p>  Kundhaivai's love is more of the kind where she was conscious of <br />  what she was giving and what she was getting. But as a princess, <br />she <br />  has to be. When taking kundhavai's love for VD we need to consider <br />a <br />  lot of things. A princess of a big kingdom, who has been brought up <br />  in such a set up, actually,<br />  falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If you <br />  look at the way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and <br />  helps the love to grow between the two. Her spontaneity could be <br />  because, she wanted to be in Chozha nadu and by falling in love <br />with <br />  a vagabond like VD, she needn't<br />  have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th <br />  bagam if I am right in PS that she loves Chozha nadu above anything <br />  else in her life. She knows what she wants, what she is capable of <br />  giving and for that what she can expect in return. She is pretty <br />  clear. </p>
<p>  * Vanathi's love for AM</p>
<p>  She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have to <br />  keep that in mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love <br />  and she takes a wow that she will not sit on the throne as his <br />patta <br />  magishi(pm). As Ram aptly puts it, the wow was to silence people <br />  like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />  harping that she loves AM to be his pm. </p>
<p>  * Manimekalai's love for VD</p>
<p>  As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls in <br />  love with VD from what her brother tells her about VD. Its like, <br />she <br />  loves her brother so much and this friendship between them (VD and <br />  her brother) has been instrumental for the love to blossom. In the <br />  end too, its because she<br />  realizes that all that her brother had projected about VD is wrong <br />  that she goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux situation <br />  where she loves this guy but is unable to accept for her brother is <br />  giving a conflicting version and then she realizes something else. <br />  And in the end, everything<br />  goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its <br />  fate that plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do <br />with <br />  the love she has for VD. If she were to be convinced that VD has <br />  done harm to her brother, I doubt she would have acted the way she <br />  did. That's not in her character. </p>
<p>  * Nandini's love for KK</p>
<p>  Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic example <br />  of leaf who is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants <br />  as and when she wants to just satisfy her whims and fancies of that <br />  moment. I doubt if she herself knows what she wants. She is not <br />  clear. All she wants is power. In<br />  the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using VD <br />  seeing how strong his will is, but in the process somewhere she <br />does <br />  fall for VD. But in the end she ends up using this guy too as a <br />  scape goat elsewhere. But she did have a lot of respect and <br />  reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />  again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people <br />  including Ravidasan. </p>
<p>  * Mandhakini's love for SC</p>
<p>  She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost his <br />  way. So all she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that's <br />  another love at first sight, which happened, when she tried saving <br />  this guy from a bear. She is an exceptional person who loses memory <br />  of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />  around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and <br />  disappointment in life. But her love for one man in her life is <br />  predominant above everything else. She lives for SC. She has no <br />life <br />  of herself. She keeps roaming around SC and his life and by her <br />  extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />  time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life in <br />  the process of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary <br />  character who cant be compared to anyone else in the novel. Not can <br />  you compare her love with anyone's for as I said, she did not live <br />  her life for herself. Her life was<br />  dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him. </p>
<p>  * Poonguzhali's love for AM</p>
<p>  This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She realized <br />  that there was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />  never get fulfilled. Instead, she realized that its better to <br />  acknowledge the love that Sendhan Amudhan was showering on her. And <br />  that was a wise decision both for<br />  herself and for AM. </p>
<p>  Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would say <br />  it was Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And <br />  she died in the process of saving his life. </p>
<p>  But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give <br />  (she too has plans for her life) and she is deciding things <br />  accordingly and handling things accordingly. Here this woman is an <br />  individual by herself and is clear in what she wants and what she <br />  can give.

I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own <br />  life happy rather than creating unhappiness for you and for your <br />  beloved.

<p>  WHOSE LOVE WAS THE GREATEST :: MESSAGE :: 288 :: REPOSTED.</p>

<p>  Hi --</p>
<p>  * Kundhavai's Love for VD</p>
<p>  Kundhaivai's love is more of the kind where she was conscious of <br />  what she was giving and what she was getting. But as a princess, <br />she <br />  has to be. When taking kundhavai's love for VD we need to consider <br />a <br />  lot of things. A princess of a big kingdom, who has been brought <br />up <br />  in such a set up, actually,<br />  falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If you <br />  look at the way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and <br />  helps the love to grow between the two. Her spontaneity could be <br />  because, she wanted to be in Chozha nadu and by falling in love <br />with <br />  a vagabond like VD, she needn't<br />  have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th <br />  bagam if I am right in PS that she loves Chozha nadu above <br />anything <br />  else in her life. She knows what she wants, what she is capable of <br />  giving and for that what she can expect in return. She is pretty <br />  clear. </p>
<p>  * Vanathi's love for AM</p>
<p>  She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have to <br />  keep that in mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love <br />  and she takes a wow that she will not sit on the throne as his <br />patta <br />  magishi(pm). As Ram aptly puts it, the wow was to silence people <br />  like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />  harping that she loves AM to be his pm. </p>
<p>  * Manimekalai's love for VD</p>
<p>  As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls in <br />  love with VD from what her brother tells her about VD. Its like, <br />she <br />  loves her brother so much and this friendship between them (VD and <br />  her brother) has been instrumental for the love to blossom. In the <br />  end too, its because she<br />  realizes that all that her brother had projected about VD is wrong <br />  that she goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux <br />situation <br />  where she loves this guy but is unable to accept for her brother <br />is <br />  giving a conflicting version and then she realizes something else. <br />  And in the end, everything<br />  goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its <br />  fate that plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do <br />with <br />  the love she has for VD. If she were to be convinced that VD has <br />  done harm to her brother, I doubt she would have acted the way she <br />  did. That's not in her character. </p>
<p>  * Nandini's love for KK</p>
<p>  Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic example <br />  of leaf who is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants <br />  as and when she wants to just satisfy her whims and fancies of <br />that <br />  moment. I doubt if she herself knows what she wants. She is not <br />  clear. All she wants is power. In<br />  the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using VD <br />  seeing how strong his will is, but in the process somewhere she <br />does <br />  fall for VD. But in the end she ends up using this guy too as a <br />  scape goat elsewhere. But she did have a lot of respect and <br />  reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />  again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people <br />  including Ravidasan. </p>
<p>  * Mandhakini's love for SC</p>
<p>  She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost <br />his <br />  way. So all she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that's <br />  another love at first sight, which happened, when she tried saving <br />  this guy from a bear. She is an exceptional person who loses <br />memory <br />  of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />  around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and <br />  disappointment in life. But her love for one man in her life is <br />  predominant above everything else. She lives for SC. She has no <br />life <br />  of herself. She keeps roaming around SC and his life and by her <br />  extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />  time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life <br />in <br />  the process of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary <br />  character who cant be compared to anyone else in the novel. Not <br />can <br />  you compare her love with anyone's for as I said, she did not live <br />  her life for herself. Her life was<br />  dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him. </p>
<p>  * Poonguzhali's love for AM</p>
<p>  This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She <br />realized <br />  that there was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />  never get fulfilled. Instead, she realized that its better to <br />  acknowledge the love that Sendhan Amudhan was showering on her. <br />And <br />  that was a wise decision both for<br />  herself and for AM. </p>
<p>  Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would say <br />  it was Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And <br />  she died in the process of saving his life. </p>
<p>  But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give <br />  (she too has plans for her life) and she is deciding things <br />  accordingly and handling things accordingly. Here this woman is an <br />  individual by herself and is clear in what she wants and what she <br />  can give. She is not interested in going<br />  about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste <br />her <br />  time on it. I would say its being more intelligent to make ones <br />own <br />  life happy rather than creating unhappiness for you and for your <br />  beloved. That way, I would rate Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai <br />  second. </p>
<p>  I don't know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain <br />Head <br />  by Any Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a <br />  particular place, that unless you know the meaning of 'I' in 'I <br />love <br />  you' you cannot understand what it actually means to love another <br />  person. That way, I feel both<br />  Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the 'I' well and <br />  emphatically. </p>
<p>  To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and <br />both <br />  you and your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love. <br />  That way I feel the only sensible women of the novel were <br />  Poonguzhali and Kundhavai. And both do not expect anything in <br />return <br />  for their love. They are happy and<br />  they make their loved ones happy too. </p>
<p>  My 5 cents :)</p>
<p>  thanks,<br />  Vidya. </p>
