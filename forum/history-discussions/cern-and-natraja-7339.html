<blockquote><p>  Actually Monalisa symbolises the heart of 'enigma' or struggle between opposites that is at the heart of any true creative person. Monalisa is far from a beautiful woman (if you look closely she even has a light moustache!)but her engimatic smile is what compels the viewer to see her again and again.</p>
<p>  I agree with Venkat that Leonardo was a good artist although I do understand that is a personal opinion. There were lots of painters who were far greater than him, Raphael and most of the Impressionists did lot of paintingsthat are worth dying for. Leonardo is a genius thinker, not a genius painter, and his genius so apparent in what he wrote in his notebooks. He pre concieved so much and his brain could hardly hold all that he knew that he left out lot of detail and there fore the detail oriented scientific world did not get what he was thinking right away. But to understand how the moon gets its light and what can hold a bridge together with hardly any instruments...now there is no word for that other than...PURE GENIUS... </p>

<p>      My earlier mail (the below one) says Leonardo was a genius painter and<br />      exceptional engineer, the arguement is about which skill in him was higher<br />      and not whether Leonardo was a good engineer or not. He was still a better<br />      engineer/scientist than most normal people like us put together but its just<br />      that i feel a Mona Lisa is a thousand times better work than a helicopter, a<br />      tank or a textile machine invention.</p>

I know about the helicopter and his other<br />        machines which he had sketched in his sketch book. These are more artist<br />        representations of ideas he had.

        <p>Rahul, Leonardo postulated how moon gets its light and how fossils are found on the moon, hundreds of years before scientists studied all that with sophisticated instruments and technology (and proved he was right!).His theories on leverage and cantilevers are responsible for several inventions including machines that grind lenses for spectacles and huge bridges across rivers. The wiki article on his science would help understand better</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_scientist_and_inventor#Practical_inventions_and_projects" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_scientist_and_inventor#Practical_inventions_and_projects">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_scientist_and_inventor#...</a></p>
<p>Noone denied the beauty of his artwork but to trivialise him as a scientistis not right, he was among the greatest thinking and creative minds of ourtime. One cannot possibly say which is more valuable, his science or his art, as much as one can choose one eye over another. </p>

<blockquote><p>    &lt;< Leonardo was more of a scientist than an artist   </p>
<p></p></></p></blockquote>
<p>agreed<br />Two of his works, the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, are the most famous, most reproduced and most parodied portrait and religious painting of all time, <br />Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon,[3] being reproduced on everything from the Euro to text books </p>
<p>but only fifteen of his paintings survive, the small number due to his constant, and frequently disastrous, experimentation with new techniques, and his chronic procrastination.</p>
<p>in 1466, at the age of fourteen, Leonardo was apprenticed to one of the most successful artists of his day, Verrocchio. Much of the painted productionof Verrocchio's workshop was done by his employees. Leonardo collaboratedwith Verrocchio on his 'Baptism of Christ', painting the young angel holding Jesus's robe in a manner that was so far superior to his master's that legend has it that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again.</p>
<p>no doubt he was a great painter. but that wasnt his greatest attribute</p>
<p>he was far greater in other things.</p>
<p>he was a scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, painter, sculptor, architect, botanist, musician and writer. <br />he was also a grave robber.<br />da vinci frequently had fresh graves robbed so that he could dissect the bodies( it was a major crime those days)</p>

        <p>&lt;< Leonardo was more of a scientist than an artist   </p>
<p>Hi; Actually it was the other way around. He was an genius artist with<br />exceptional science skills. There is a specific art division in the field of<br />engineering(especially automotive engineering) called Cutaway art. Not many<br />are aware of that as it requires a certain high degree of skill and<br />visualization. The Cutaway artist requires some engineering knowledge to do<br />this work. Here the artist sketches the car/machine as a whole and reveals<br />the innards with breathtaking detail. Sometimes these are better than most<br />CAD models. This is a dying art as high resolution CAD models have replaced<br />this but this is still practiced by some car stylists in the UK and some in<br />the US.</p>
<p>Leonardo was the earliest Cutaway artist with incredible engineering<br />knowledge. Remember, most of his sketches remained sketches and he ony<br />built/prototyped a few of his ideas. He was an artist (thereby the<br />incredible imagination as most ideas were too radical for his times) with<br />exceptional engineering/science knowledge.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Leonardo was more of a scientist than an artist but whatever he did his genius was unparelled. He is one of the earliest known vegetarians (in Rome that too!)</p></blockquote>
<p>Many authors have speculated on various aspects of Leonardo's personality.One such aspect is his respect for life evidenced by his vegetarianism andhis habit, described by Vasari, of purchasing caged birds and releasing them</p>
<p>in is obsession to draw human and animal bodies to perfection davinci dissected dead bodies of men and animals.</p>
<p>though it is later said he had permission to do it it was very common for unconnected people to be charged as witches and burnt for the same crime.</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<p>and is credited with so many inventions starting with bobbin on seweing machine that it is fairly common to say if you don't know who invented something it is probably him.</p>
<blockquote><p>  His scientific notebook called Codex Leicester, (named after the Duke of Leicester who owned it first) is now in posession of Bill Gates who has made it digital and available for the rest of the world. It had explanations (among other things including his grocery list and debt details) of why fossils are found on the moon and luminosity of the moon, both of which were found to be accurate hundreds of years later.</p>

<p>      Also just after his novel was released they did find a 'secret code' in Da Vinci's work which added up to a musical note (the research was goingon long before his book but nevertheless the discovery was sensational because of his book).</p>
<p>    Hi</p>
<p>    davinci was just one crazy man in crazier times.<br />    he was lucky to have lived so long.<br />    half the things that he did were punishable by death in those days law.by burning on the stake.<br />    but he continued to do them and recorded them too in his own codes.</p>
<p>    of course though people remember him for the mona lisa his achievementswere elsewhere and much better.</p>

<p>        Hi Maloo<br />        somehow though it may not be historical fact browns books do give small pieces of info on history, architecture, geography and technology which certainly enhance GK. wallace used to do it and so did sheldon.</p>
<p>        CERN and the internet is one key exapmple.</p>
<p>        venketesh<br />          My humble appeal to fellow book lovers, please do not confuse DanBrown and other very convincing writers of fiction to be stating any factsas they are. Brown actually got into a lot of trouble even with Da Vinci Code by stating on his website that everything he had there was historical fact. He retracted and changed it later.</p>
<p>          It is very common among book lovers and sometimes even movie lovers to make this misjudgement - like we talked of the holocaust before and there are an incredible number of people who think it is like it is in numerous hollywood movies. Very very far from the truth - but can provide a gateway for our interest, just like PS provided a gateway for so many of us forinterest in culture and history.</p>

        <p>Leonardo was more of a scientist than an artist but whatever he did his genius was unparelled. He is one of the earliest known vegetarians (in Rome that too!) and is credited with so many inventions starting with bobbin on seweing machine that it is fairly common to say if you don't know who invented something it is probably him.</p>
<p>His scientific notebook called Codex Leicester, (named after the Duke of Leicester who owned it first) is now in posession of Bill Gates who has made it digital and available for the rest of the world. It had explanations (among other things including his grocery list and debt details) of why fossils are found on the moon and luminosity of the moon, both of which were found to be accurate hundreds of years later.</p>

<p>      venketesh<br />        My humble appeal to fellow book lovers, please do not confuse Dan Brown and other very convincing writers of fiction to be stating any facts as they are. Brown actually got into a lot of trouble even with Da Vinci Code by stating on his website that everything he had there was historical fact. He retracted and changed it later.</p>
<p>        It is very common among book lovers and sometimes even movie loversto make this misjudgement - like we talked of the holocaust before and there are an incredible number of people who think it is like it is in numerous hollywood movies. Very very far from the truth - but can provide a gateway for our interest, just like PS provided a gateway for so many of us for interest in culture and history.</p>

<p>  venketesh<br />    My humble appeal to fellow book lovers, please do not confuse Dan Brownand other very convincing writers of fiction to be stating any facts as they are. Brown actually got into a lot of trouble even with Da Vinci Code bystating on his website that everything he had there was historical fact. He retracted and changed it later.</p>
<p>    It is very common among book lovers and sometimes even movie lovers to make this misjudgement - like we talked of the holocaust before and there are an incredible number of people who think it is like it is in numerous hollywood movies. Very very far from the truth - but can provide a gateway for our interest, just like PS provided a gateway for so many of us for interest in culture and history.</p>

<p>I beg to differ.. digital fortress was a load of hocus-pocus. . if you really want to know more about encryption etc.. read a book by Simon Singh on it.. where he talks about how codes developed (from the humble Ceaser's code) to current day RSA based encryption strategies.</p>

        <p>ACtually the Internet/World Wide Web was the idea of an English scientist name Tim Berners-Lee who worked at CERN. The US Military bought his idea andgave their powerful computers as base for testing and implementing it. Of course once it worked they wanted to keep it patented to them which Lee wasagainst and the idea was publicised to the whole world.</p>
<p>Some also make the distinction and say the Internet was invented by US Military while World Wide Web was invented by CERN.</p>

        <p>Yeah Brown is definitely a good writer. I can't say I enjoyed Angels and Demons as much as I did the Da Vinci Code though. It is full of odd and highly improbable situations. Perhaps since it is a predecessor to Da Vinci Codethe author may have matured in his work.</p>
<p>I am yet to read anything more of his yet.</p>
