<p>Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@gmail.com  wrote:<br />Dear Vijay,</drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her opinions. We can't say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is wrong (that is my own view of course) but at the same time I also believe he has every right to his opinion. Who was it who said that "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"? Or words to that effect.. </p>
<p>I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of Googling got me this :</p>
<p>This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely attributed to the French writer Voltaire, that master of liberal philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. Fran?ois-Marie Arouet ( Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to England. <br />But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment you quote. According to a number of web sites, "The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's words in his "Treatise on Toleration," which includes such thoughts as: <br />Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,</p>

<p>Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />shouldn't have saying "not considered <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is not<br />historic novel" when <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is completely based on <br />historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to <br />disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.</p>
<p>Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />arrogant.</p>
<p>So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />mass opinion.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  Ok here's my tuppence worth. PS is a work of<br />  historical fiction. No one can<br />  refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />  like that, it is either<br />  out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />  or out of arrogance<br />  (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />  have to realize that he<br />  is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />  If we all love PS and<br />  Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />  disagrees with us or<br />  disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />  his opinion, just as the<br />  fact that we think PS is good is just our opinion. <br />  Also, one doesn't need to<br />  be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />  Ganguly now, does one? Or be<br />  a politician to comment on politics. :-) Similarly,<br />  IMHO, one does not need<br />  to be a great writer to critique novels.</p>
<p>  My 0.02 $ worth!</p>

<p>      ====================<br />    Dear Sridhar,</p>
<p>    I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />  mail.</p>
<p>    If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />  about 56 to<br />    various questions, the concentration is more on<br />  Love / Women /<br />    Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>    Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />  out of scope of our<br />    main line of communications ...</p>
<p>    There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />  - at Thillaisthanam <br />    (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />  Social Novels with<br />    Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />  Vaanam" in mid<br />    70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa <br />  ... forerunner for<br />    titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>    I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />  touch all these years ..</p>
<p>    As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />  about 40 names to<br />    Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />  the most enchanting<br />    name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />  himself could not<br />    find! </p>
<p>    Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />  first .. then they<br />    comment on acknowledged ones ..</p>

        <p>Dear SriRaman,</p>
<p>PP had many wives before nandini.Even though she was his legally <br />wedded wife,it is the equilant of kovalan going after madhavi and <br />leaving away kannagi.After marrying nadhini pp never thought about <br />his wives.He paid the price for it.</p>
<p>Love often starts with infatuation,but goes beyond it.</p>

<p>  I agree with you.Pennasai will throw a man to dirt.But that will <br />not <br />  be because of legally wedded wife.It will come only because of <br />going <br />  astray from your wife.</p>
<p>  In history examples are sultan suleiman falling prey to his <br />russian <br />  concubine Roxalina and killing his sons and marking the downfall <br />of <br />  ottomon empire,paris abducting helen and losing a kingdom <br />  etc,English king,henry VIII converting entire Britain to <br />protestents <br />  from catholics to marry the woman of his choice etc.</p>
<p>  True love will not destroy.Illicit love will destroy.</p>

<p>    i think we are becoming too obsessed with Prabanchan and <br />deviating <br />  from the purpose.....</p>
<p>    It is like Ravana being too obsessed with Rama , whereby he lost <br />  all his virtues and ultimately perished.......(pls do not start a <br />  thread as to whether is right to compare Rama with Prabanchan and <br />us <br />  with Ravana)...</p>
<p>    by concentrating too much on prabanchan, we are losing our <br />  focus.....</p>
<p>    today, even a great Person like "Mahatma Gandhi" is not above <br />  Criticism.. so accept it as a way of life...</p>

<p>    I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her <br />opinions. <br />  We can't say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can <br />  disagree with his opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is <br />  wrong (that is my own view of course) but at the same time I also <br />  believe he has every right to his opinion. Who was it who said <br />  that "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death <br />  your right to say it"? Or words to that effect.. </p>
<p>    I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little bit of Googling got me <br />  this :</p>
<p>    This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is <br />widely <br />  attributed to the French writer Voltaire, that master of liberal <br />  philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. Fran?ois-Marie Arouet ( <br />  Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated <br />  writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the <br />  Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were <br />in <br />  sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries <br />  twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to <br />  England. <br />    But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the <br />  sentiment you quote. According to a number of web sites, "The <br />phrase <br />  was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It <br />  comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice <br />Hall <br />  and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. <br />  Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's words in his "Treatise <br />on <br />  Toleration," which includes such thoughts as: <br />    Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life <br />  those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it <br />might <br />  be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,</p>

<p>    Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />    shouldn't have saying "not considered PS is not<br />    historic novel" when PS is completely based on <br />    historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />    Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />    Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".</p>
<p>    Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to <br />    disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />    writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.</p>
<p>    Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />    doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />    world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />    arrogant.</p>
<p>    So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />    mass opinion.</p>

<p>      Dear All,</p>
<p>      Ok here's my tuppence worth. PS is a work of<br />      historical fiction. No one can<br />      refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />      like that, it is either<br />      out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />      or out of arrogance<br />      (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />      have to realize that he<br />      is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />      If we all love PS and<br />      Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />      disagrees with us or<br />      disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />      his opinion, just as the<br />      fact that we think PS is good is just our opinion. <br />      Also, one doesn't need to<br />      be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />      Ganguly now, does one? Or be<br />      a politician to comment on politics. :-) Similarly,<br />      IMHO, one does not need<br />      to be a great writer to critique novels.</p>

<p>          ====================<br />        Dear Sridhar,</p>
<p>        I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />      mail.</p>
<p>        If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />      about 56 to<br />        various questions, the concentration is more on<br />      Love / Women /<br />        Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>        Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />      out of scope of our<br />        main line of communications ...</p>
<p>        There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />      - at Thillaisthanam <br />        (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />      Social Novels with<br />        Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />      Vaanam" in mid<br />        70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa <br />      ... forerunner for<br />        titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>        I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />      touch all these years ..</p>
<p>        As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />      about 40 names to<br />        Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />      the most enchanting<br />        name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />      himself could not<br />        find! </p>
<p>        Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />      first .. then they<br />        comment on acknowledged ones ..</p>

        <p>Dear Sampath,<br />If I recall <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  correctly, Nandhini is the legally wedded wife of PP. PP did not abduct her like Paris did Helen, nor did he kill people because of her. He was only infatuated with her.....so that brings us to the question......is infatuation true love...? I would say yes, my friend...</p>

<p>  Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />  shouldn't have saying "not considered PS is not<br />  historic novel" when PS is completely based on <br />  historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />  Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />  Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".</p>
<p>  Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to <br />  disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />  writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.</p>
<p>  Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />  doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />  world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />  arrogant.</p>
<p>  So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />  mass opinion.</p>

<p>    Dear All,</p>
<p>    Ok here's my tuppence worth. PS is a work of<br />    historical fiction. No one can<br />    refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />    like that, it is either<br />    out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />    or out of arrogance<br />    (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />    have to realize that he<br />    is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />    If we all love PS and<br />    Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />    disagrees with us or<br />    disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />    his opinion, just as the<br />    fact that we think PS is good is just our opinion. <br />    Also, one doesn't need to<br />    be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />    Ganguly now, does one? Or be<br />    a politician to comment on politics. :-) Similarly,<br />    IMHO, one does not need<br />    to be a great writer to critique novels.</p>

<p>        ====================<br />      Dear Sridhar,</p>
<p>      I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />    mail.</p>
<p>      If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />    about 56 to<br />      various questions, the concentration is more on<br />    Love / Women /<br />      Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>      Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />    out of scope of our<br />      main line of communications ...</p>
<p>      There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />    - at Thillaisthanam <br />      (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />    Social Novels with<br />      Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />    Vaanam" in mid<br />      70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa <br />    ... forerunner for<br />      titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>      I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />    touch all these years ..</p>
<p>      As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />    about 40 names to<br />      Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />    the most enchanting<br />      name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />    himself could not<br />      find! </p>
<p>      Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />    first .. then they<br />      comment on acknowledged ones ..</p>

<p>  Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />  shouldn't have saying "not considered PS is not<br />  historic novel" when PS is completely based on <br />  historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />  Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />  Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".</p>
<p>  Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to <br />  disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />  writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.</p>
<p>  Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />  doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />  world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />  arrogant.</p>
<p>  So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />  mass opinion.</p>

<p>    Ok here's my tuppence worth. PS is a work of<br />    historical fiction. No one can<br />    refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />    like that, it is either<br />    out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />    or out of arrogance<br />    (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />    have to realize that he<br />    is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />    If we all love PS and<br />    Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />    disagrees with us or<br />    disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />    his opinion, just as the<br />    fact that we think PS is good is just our opinion. <br />    Also, one doesn't need to<br />    be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />    Ganguly now, does one?

<p>        ====================<br />      Dear Sridhar,</p>
<p>      I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />    mail.</p>
<p>      If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />    about 56 to<br />      various questions, the concentration is more on<br />    Love / Women /<br />      Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>      Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />    out of scope of our<br />      main line of communications ...</p>
<p>      There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />    - at Thillaisthanam <br />      (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />    Social Novels with<br />      Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />    Vaanam" in mid<br />      70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa <br />    ... forerunner for<br />      titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>      I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />    touch all these years ..</p>
<p>      As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />    about 40 names to<br />      Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />    the most enchanting<br />      name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />    himself could not<br />      find! </p>
<p>      Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />    first .. then they<br />      comment on acknowledged ones ..</p>

<p>      ====================<br />    Dear Sridhar,</p>
<p>    I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />  mail.</p>
<p>    If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />  about 56 to<br />    various questions, the concentration is more on<br />  Love / Women /<br />    Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>    Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />  out of scope of our<br />    main line of communications ...</p>
<p>    There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />  - at Thillaisthanam <br />    (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />  Social Novels with<br />    Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />  Vaanam" in mid<br />    70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa <br />  ... forerunner for<br />    titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>    I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />  touch all these years ..</p>
<p>    As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />  about 40 names to<br />    Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />  the most enchanting<br />    name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />  himself could not<br />    find! </p>
<p>    Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />  first .. then they<br />    comment on acknowledged ones ..</p>
