        <p>Dear Vijay</p>
<p>As I see this message from the group's website, I see some obscure <br />characters below for the verses of Andal. Please tell me how to read <br />it properly. I mean what should I do to my PC, so that I can read it <br />properly. I have most of the Tamizh fonts installed in my PC.</p>

<p>  Hi ravi,</p>
<p>  Andaal verses were immortalised in mallai ( kudavoil balu sir had <br />  written a superb article on this - the govardana panel in mallai) -</p>
<p>  i was writing about this in another forum ( i will save the <br />pictures <br />  in the photos section) - this is a comaprison between the varaha <br />  images in udayagiri n mallai. </p>
<p>  I was always fasinated by so many depictiond of this scene n had <br />  wrongly surmised that canons for such sculpture was not existent <br />  then. For eg, in mallai varaha panel - you will see the devi <br />  lovingly placed on the lords thighs - if you really watch closely <br />  you will see that her upper garment has come loose and is lying on <br />  her right leg ...and her face is slightly bent to the right ( <br />  depiction of shyness) and the the lord is lovingly embracing <br />mother <br />  earth (ok since we are talking of mature subjects here - he is <br />  actually nuzzling her ......)....but in udayagiri she is shown as <br />  dangling from his tusks......</p>
<p>  It was only after i read andaals verses that I realised both were <br />  correct......just that they were two acts of the same story</p>
<p>  Aandaal had ..... Fallen in love with the lord n composed some of <br />  the very open verses of love</p>
<p>  She sings thus.... </p>

        <p>Ravi,</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Ravi" <ravi_eds@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Vairam</p>
<p>  Again, neenga conceptually different people comparison panaringa...<br />  Comparing Andal with Ayana chirpi is totally wrong.<br />  Andal, is an epitome of Bhakti or She is devotion itself. She, if <br />I <br />  am allowed to say, is greater than Ranganatha himself. As with <br />Valli, <br />  where it is said 'Kura magal iru patham paritha sekara', devotion <br />has <br />  that respect with the greater spiritual plane.</p>
<p>  Ayana sirpi's love for sculpture is dazzled when sivakami is lost. <br />  Andal...Ranga is NEVER lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>May be true. But until the conclusion happened, i.e, losing <br />sivakami, definitely Ayana siRpi's passion was the same as that of <br />Andal. Only the end result can compared for quality. Otherwise the <br />thought or passion in both is the same. It is only the strength and <br />determination which was present in Andal is missing in Ayana siRpi. <br />That does not mean that his passion, when exhibited, was impure.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  In any form, Andal's poo malai or paa malai, never die with time, <br />but <br />  Ayana sirpi may be lost in a few hundred years. <br />  Any art alone is mortal but lives longer than any human work, <br />however <br />  art (poo malai - paa malai etc) devoted in the service of God, is <br />  immortal.</p></blockquote>
<p>I beg to differ here. Here is where, the spirituality comes into <br />fore. Nammazhwar says ".... un manathAl en ninaindhirundhAi ivaL <br />thiRathu en seiginRAyE". This is one of the life lines of <br />Vaishnavite Philosophy. This says that what ever happens in the <br />world is due to Gods Sankalpam, i.e, His desire and determination. <br />So if Andal's pA mAlai did not die with time, it is His grace, and <br />if Ayana siRpi's sculpture is lost, it is also destined by Him. </p>
<p>Atleast for now, both Andal's pAmAlai and Ayana siRi's kal malai are <br />co-existing. We do not know about the future. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>
<p>PS: Andal's Poo malai, though is lost now. :-)  </p></ravi_eds@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  I believe there is a vaishnava expert here to guide us on Andal, i <br />am <br />  too small a being to talk of such a great bhaktai, even to think <br />of <br />  her as human.</p>
<p>  -- R</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Ha Ha Ha, if this is intended towards me, I am no expert Ravi. I <br />mean this. However, from an unbiased view point, especially when you <br />compare Andal and Ayana siRpi, I believe, they both had great <br />passions on their objectives, only that Andal was more determined <br />and the destiny favoured Her ("un manathAl en ninaindhirundhAi") <br />while Ayana siRpi was less determined and so was his destiny. We can <br />easily compare the passion of both. Andal's passion made her go <br />against the ritualistic practice of not adorning the garland, before <br />offering it to God, while Ayana siRpi's passion, made him mad, even <br />to the extent that he struck a deal with the enemy of His king <br />(Mahendravarman) who he respected so much. </p>
<p>This is height of devotion. Not knowing what one does out of great <br />devotion. Periyazhwar, father of Andal, incidentally describes this <br />state of mind in his periyAzhwAr thirumozhi says "atthA ariyE endRu <br />nAn azhaithAl, pithA enbar piRar..."</p>
<p>Thirumangai Azhwar personifies this state of bliss, unmindful of the <br />worldly logics, that he even went to the extent of performing "madal <br />eduthal". Actually, madal eduthal, as per the Tamizh Ilakkiyams is <br />ordained only for the male, who will wear a garland out of the palm <br />leaf and sit on a Donkey and go around the town saying that the <br />women he loves does not turn her eyes towards him. This is something <br />like emotional black mail. The reason I say that Thirumangai Azhwar <br />went against the norm is that, he had sung the two <br />prabhandhams "siRiya thirumaDal" and "periya thirumaDal" in nAyaki <br />bhAvam, means, thinking of him as a women. So a women should not be <br />doing this as per the customs prevalent in those times. But his love <br />for reaching God and the frustration that He is not showing up, made <br />him go well against the customs and rituals, prevalent at those <br />times.</p>
<p>So the Love, Devotion towards God are in one's thought and no <br />customs and rituals can stipulate a boundary for these, when the <br />jeevAtmA goes into a state of eternal bliss.</p>

        <p>Hi Vairam, Malathi,</p>
<p>Have you guys come across some good western country music ? I guess <br />you both are based in the US... Most of these songs carry this tender <br />feeling in utterly simple words. Lets sample a few songs here, if you <br />have the patience to read:</p>
<p>George Strait - It just comes natural<br />====================================</p>
<p>Sun shines, Clouds rain,<br />Train whistles blow and guitars play,<br />Preachers preach, farmers plow,<br />Wishes go up and the world goes round.</p>
<p>And I love you, It just come natural,<br />It just comes natural.<br />Seasons change, Rivers wind.<br />Tumble weeds roll and the stars shine.<br />Wind howls, dawn breaks<br />Cowboys riding' time slips away.</p>
<p>And I love you, It just come natural,<br />It's what I was born to do,<br />Don't have to think it through,<br />Baby, it's so easy loving you<br />It just come natural.</p>
<p>Fire burns, waves crash,<br />Seeds grow and good things last,<br />Ships sail, dreams fly,<br />Night falls and full moons rise.</p>
<p>And I love you, It just come Natural<br />And I love you, It just come Natural<br />It just come Natural<br />It just come Natural</p>
<p>Don Williams - Nobody, but you<br />==============================</p>
<p>Who, by touching my hand<br />Makes me understand, questions my heart is asking<br />Who, opened my eyes, made me realise<br />Love is everlasting</p>
<p>Nobody but you, nobody but you<br />Nobody else, could love me, like you do<br />Nobody but you, could see me through<br />Your love is true and I don't need nobody but you</p>
<p>Who comes just close enough<br />And shows me that love is nothing to be afraid of<br />Who, holds me so tight every night <br />And shows me what love is made of</p>
<p>Nobody but you, nobody but you<br />Nobody else, could love me, like you do<br />Nobody but you, could see me through<br />Your love is true and I don't need nobody but you</p>
<p>Don Williams - Lay down beside me<br />=================================</p>
<p>I've spent my life looking for you<br />Finding my way wasn't easy to do<br />but I knew there was you all the while<br />And it's been worth every mile</p>
<p>So lay down beside me<br />Love me and hide me <br />Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away<br />Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat<br />And don't ever wander away</p>
<p>Mornings and evenings all were the same<br />And there was no music till I heard your name<br />But I knew when I saw you smile<br />Now I can rest for a while</p>
<p>So lay down beside me<br />Love me and hide me <br />Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away<br />Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat<br />And don't ever wander away</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>I can just go on ( or may be write about 1 song per week! )... one of <br />my ambitions is to write a treatise on Cankam poetry and contemporary <br />country music.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Malathi, I totally accept your views.</p>
<p>  But one great thing about Sangam is it describes every small feeling<br />  lovers have.Young Kids of school though have access to internet and<br />  use to its maximum utility can never understand it , till they grow <br />as<br />  an adult and experience something called love. The feelings are too<br />  subtle, one has to experience such kind of feelings to really<br />  appreciate the depth of the poem.</p>
<p>  The problem these days is every thing is so open the art of being<br />  subtle is totally missing, the fine line between being artistic and<br />  being gross is often crossed.</p>
<p>  No wonder every scholar who has read Sangam literature says the<br />  greatness of Sangam poetry has never been surpassed in this 2000<br />  years. The greatness of Sangam lies in its simple down to earth<br />  feelings.Probably this would be the only class of poetry in India<br />  which was so secular and concerned with lives of common people.</p>

<p>    Vairam, of course you need to be an adult to<br />    appreciate it fully. Books have changed a lot, i saw<br />    ninth grade text book it was quite unlike anything we<br />    learnt. On the other hand, these poems and stories in<br />    those days were subtle ways of educating growing<br />    children on adult realities, there was no television<br />    or internet in those days so pondering on what it<br />    means perhaps is a gentle way to waken the adult in a<br />    child and far less intrusive that modern methods :)</p>
<p>    My grandmother used to say the subtle practical<br />    intention behind young women chanting Tiruppavai (to<br />    get married soon) was similar, a gentle awakening of<br />    adult emotions mixed with devotional rasa,</p>

<p>hi venkatesh</p>
<p>you are welcome - we are all learning and thanks for those extensive <br />works. but one thing you need to know is that when you talk of alwars <br />and nayanmaars - these were special people - they had already reached <br />a plane - a divine sublime state - where they could see the <br />manifestations of the lords in everything. </p>
<p>But to the common man he needed more tools and had to led on the path -<br />temples, worship, rituals, the mantras - are all tools that help the <br />not so endowed common man to see the higher light - to help him <br />focus... its akin to a walker ( toy) for a baby or training wheels for <br />a novice cycle learner - at first you just cant do without the <br />supports, but once you have mastered the craft - you dont need them. </p>
<p>The concept of a hindu temple, its construction, placement of idols - <br />every slab, every elevation - has a meaning - they are there for a <br />purpose and the purpose is to help you attain the best state to <br />experience god. </p>

<p>Sorry for taking a new question out of this. It is just my curiosity. <br />On seeing the picture, I noticed that Uma Parameshwari was sporting <br />a "poonal". Just curious to know, if there is any reference to ladies <br />wearing a Poonal in older days. </p>

        <p>Vairam,</p>
<p>Well said!! I am very much with you on this. Just to corroborate, we <br />all know the story of ManakkOil koNda MaNikkanAr. It is know to all <br />that God, just ignored the temple built by the king and placed <br />Himself in the heart of this devotee. Yes, it is the BhAvam of Love <br />and Servitude, which is important here.</p>
<p>Again another quote from NammAzhwar. He says</p>
<p>"poosum sAndhu en nenjamE, punayun kaNNi enadhuyirE<br />vAsagam sei mAlayE vAn pattAdayum agdhE<br />thEsamAna aNigalanum en kai kooppuch cheigayE <br />Isan gnyAlam uNdu umizhndha endhai Eka mUrthikkE".</p>
<p>This situation is a similar blissful situation like Andal <br />experienced. Here the Azhwar goes to the extent of saying that his <br />Heart is the Sandhanam, and his Life is the Poem, and chanting His <br />names is the Garland etc.... At this state, it does not matter, <br />whether the Idol is consecrated or not. He (Nammazhwar) even goes to <br />the extent of saying </p>
<p>"uNNum sORu, parugum nIr, thinnum vetRilai, ellam kaNNan.." and <br />obviously we do not consecrate these vasthus. Right?</p>

<p>      Regards,<br />      Vairam</p>
<p>    Hi vairam,</p>
<p>    A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt become god - <br />meaning <br />    its is not treated as moolavar ( if in stone) or utsavar ( if <br />metal) <br />    just like that.... there are a lot of proceedings ( ok - you may <br />    call it rituals) - which are performed to infuse the idol with <br />the <br />    qualities that lift if from being a mere mortal creation to the <br />    plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats with regard to <br />temple <br />    sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.</p>
<p>    as regards the god of man's creation and the man of god's <br />creation - <br />    these are concepts that have spawned entire religions. the <br />question <br />    of who is god is different from is God there.</p>
<p>    so what does god look like etc is for us to see within <br />ourselves - <br />    to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are different schools <br />of <br />    thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and beliefs - a <br />fistfull <br />    of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a handful of clay. </p>
<p>    But the beauty in all this is the transformation was right in <br />front <br />    of the eyes of the worshipper and once transformed the powers <br />were <br />    deemed to be infused into the idol. this is the power of <br />suggestion -<br />    but i would like to disagree on the sculpture being in a museum <br />    just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the eyes of the <br />beholder <br />    and not the location. I can vouch of this personally - a year <br />back i <br />    had such a profound experience - a chance visit to the singapore <br />    museum....reposting below</p>
<p>    We were greated at the entrance itself by a cut out of a chola<br />    bronze - an 11th C Uma Parameshwari. There were a couple of other<br />    chola bronzes ..incl one of Sambandar. There was also a beautiful<br />    stone sculpture of Subramaniar - chola era</p>
<p>    Unfortunately the piece de resistance - the Uma paramershwari <br />idol<br />    was a special exhibit and the guards wouldnt allow us to take<br />    pictures of this one alone...</p>
<p>    The beauty of this piece was breathtaking - more than the aura <br />of <br />    seeing the handiwork of agifted artist over 1000 years ago - the <br />    sheer mastery ofcraftsmanship left us spell bound. statue was at <br />    best 2 feet in height, but the detailing was exqusite...the <br />grace <br />    and calm of herface and love in the smile, the lovely locks of <br />her <br />    hair fallinginto rolling tresses over her sholders..the <br />intricate <br />    ornaments on his neck, the grace of her poise - the gentle sway <br />    acccentuating the narrow waist, the beautiful and elaborate work <br />on <br />    his lower garments..her hands and fingers bring life to the <br />    figurine...it was the pure mixing of artistic beauty with <br />    spirituality - the experience left me spell bound - which is <br />what <br />    the original chola patrons would have wanted the image to do...</p>
<p>    this is the image...</p>

        <p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<blockquote><p>  A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt become god - meaning <br />  its is not treated as moolavar ( if in stone) or utsavar ( if <br />metal) <br />  just like that.... there are a lot of proceedings ( ok - you may <br />  call it rituals) - which are performed to infuse the idol with the <br />  qualities that lift if from being a mere mortal creation to the <br />  plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats with regard to <br />temple <br />  sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is true that certain rituals called "prathistai" makes the <br />idol get the Godly powers, it is also true that the God is <br />Omnipresent. He also manifests in every form that his devotee thinks <br />of Him. Remember the pAsuram from Prabhandham that I quoted during <br />discussion on Ramanuja ("thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam <br />thAnE.."). That was a Vaishnavite work. I am pretty sure that the <br />same would have been said by Nayanmars as well. Afterall, keeping <br />aside certain High level philosophies and the Supreme God <br />differences, the AzhwArs and Nayanmars talk about the same love and <br />devotion. </p>
<p>Just to substantiate this, are we not seeing so many sculptures in <br />the pillars of a temple being worshipped as Gods by devotees out of <br />love and affection. These sculptures are not consecrated. Still they <br />go about doing pradhakshiNam or kaRpUra hArathi for these. This is <br />what is signified in the pAsuram "thamar ugandhadhu...". So the <br />words of Kannadasan as quoted by Malathi "Kadavul enru pArthAl, <br />kadavuL, silai endru pArthAl silai" is exactly in the same lines.</p>
<p>In fact the lines of KD as quoted by Malathi, "uNdu enRAl uNdu, <br />illai endrAl illai" is also sung by NammAzhwAr in ThiruvAimozhi, </p>
<p>"uLan enil uLan, avan uruvam ivvuruvugaL<br />uLan alan enil, avan aruvam ivvaruvugaL<br />uLanena ilanena ivai guNamudaimayin<br />uLaniru thagaimaiOdu ozhivilan paranthE"</p>
<p>Similarly regarding the "satha kooru", the very next pAsuram says</p>
<p>"parantha thaN paRavayuL nIr thorum parandhuLan<br />parantha aNdamidhena, nila visumbu ozhivara<br />karantha sil idanthorum idam thigazh poruLthorum<br />karandhengum parandhuLan ivayuNda suranE"</p>
<p>That He is omnipresent in every water, land, sky and everything that <br />is manifest and unmanifest is signified here. The upanishads, <br />glorify this aspect of the Supreme God as "aNoraNIyAn mahatho <br />mahIyAn". He is the smallest of the smallest atom and the largest of <br />the largest thing to exist in the universe".</p>
<p>Taking this into cognizance, it wouldn't be unfair to say that if <br />one sees a sculpture as a true god, it indeed becomes one, no matter <br />if the ritualistic consecration is done or not.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  so what does god look like etc is for us to see within ourselves - <br />  to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are different schools <br />of <br />  thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and beliefs - a fistfull <br />  of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a handful of clay. </p></blockquote>
<p>Very well said Vijay. This is exactly what I tried to describe above.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  But the beauty in all this is the transformation was right in <br />front <br />  of the eyes of the worshipper and once transformed the powers were <br />  deemed to be infused into the idol. this is the power of <br />suggestion -<br />  but i would like to disagree on the sculpture being in a museum <br />  just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the eyes of the beholder <br />  and not the location. </p></blockquote>
<p>Again another well said sentence and I was meaning this too above. <br />While I am not greater authority than you to certify you, I only <br />wanted to substantiate these words, by providing certain references <br />to the spiritual scriptures. So please do not mistake me as I am <br />trying to certify you.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

        <p>as anuman said, 'kanden seethayai'.... I am a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  excited.</p>
<p>Many of our group members must be already knowing this, but for a <br />novice like me its a treasure (how far I am going to use it..will i <br />ever use it, time only will answer).</p>
<p>I came across <a href="http://www.tamilvu.org" title="www.tamilvu.org">www.tamilvu.org</a> and under their library section, they <br />have almost all the sangam literature, with.. urai...this is what I was <br />looking for. Because Project Madurai gives only the original text but <br />not the 'urai'...</p>
<p>I am yet to browse fully the library, thought will share with the <br />group, before I proceed.</p>

<p>  It was only after i read andaals verses that I realised both were <br />  correct......just that they were two acts of the same story</p>
<p>  Aandaal had ..... Fallen in love with the lord n composed some of <br />  the very open verses of love</p>

<p>Again, neenga conceptually different people comparison panaringa...<br />Comparing Andal with Ayana chirpi is totally wrong.<br />Andal, is an epitome of Bhakti or She is devotion itself. She, if I <br />am allowed to say, is greater than Ranganatha himself. As with Valli, <br />where it is said 'Kura magal iru patham paritha sekara', devotion has <br />that respect with the greater spiritual plane.</p>
<p>Ayana sirpi's love for sculpture is dazzled when sivakami is lost. <br />Andal...Ranga is NEVER lost.</p>
<p>In any form, Andal's poo malai or paa malai, never die with time, but <br />Ayana sirpi may be lost in a few hundred years. <br />Any art alone is mortal but lives longer than any human work, however <br />art (poo malai - paa malai etc) devoted in the service of God, is <br />immortal.</p>
<p>I believe there is a vaishnava expert here to guide us on Andal, i am <br />too small a being to talk of such a great bhaktai, even to think of <br />her as human.</p>

<p>    Hi vairam,</p>
<p>    A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt become god - <br />meaning <br />    its is not treated as moolavar ( if in stone) or utsavar ( if <br />metal) <br />    just like that.... there are a lot of proceedings ( ok - you may <br />    call it rituals) - which are performed to infuse the idol with <br />the <br />    qualities that lift if from being a mere mortal creation to the <br />    plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats with regard to <br />temple <br />    sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.</p>
<p>    as regards the god of man's creation and the man of god's <br />creation - <br />    these are concepts that have spawned entire religions. the <br />question <br />    of who is god is different from is God there.</p>
<p>    so what does god look like etc is for us to see within ourselves -</p>
<p>    to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are different schools <br />of <br />    thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and beliefs - a <br />fistfull <br />    of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a handful of clay. </p>
<p>    But the beauty in all this is the transformation was right in <br />front <br />    of the eyes of the worshipper and once transformed the powers <br />were <br />    deemed to be infused into the idol. this is the power of <br />suggestion -<br />    but i would like to disagree on the sculpture being in a museum <br />    just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the eyes of the beholder <br />    and not the location. I can vouch of this personally - a year <br />back i <br />    had such a profound experience - a chance visit to the singapore <br />    museum....reposting below</p>
<p>    We were greated at the entrance itself by a cut out of a chola<br />    bronze - an 11th C Uma Parameshwari. There were a couple of other<br />    chola bronzes ..incl one of Sambandar. There was also a beautiful<br />    stone sculpture of Subramaniar - chola era</p>
<p>    Unfortunately the piece de resistance - the Uma paramershwari idol<br />    was a special exhibit and the guards wouldnt allow us to take<br />    pictures of this one alone...</p>
<p>    The beauty of this piece was breathtaking - more than the aura of <br />    seeing the handiwork of agifted artist over 1000 years ago - the <br />    sheer mastery ofcraftsmanship left us spell bound. statue was at <br />    best 2 feet in height, but the detailing was exqusite...the grace <br />    and calm of herface and love in the smile, the lovely locks of <br />her <br />    hair fallinginto rolling tresses over her sholders..the intricate <br />    ornaments on his neck, the grace of her poise - the gentle sway <br />    acccentuating the narrow waist, the beautiful and elaborate work <br />on <br />    his lower garments..her hands and fingers bring life to the <br />    figurine...it was the pure mixing of artistic beauty with <br />    spirituality - the experience left me spell bound - which is what <br />    the original chola patrons would have wanted the image to do...</p>

        <p>There is a whole south indian temple installed within<br />Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was 'sold' or so I<br />heard by a famous south indian merchant (brothers)<br />some years ago, how they 'sold' century old art is<br />quite a mystery but possible considering the sad state<br />of our temples and historical monuments.</p>
<p>An exhibit in a museum is of course not the same<br />purpose as a temple exhibit - but look at some of our<br />temples, the century old pillars 'adorned' by human<br />spittle, red dye(kumkum?:)) and waste and names<br />scribbled on stone where the sculptor himself did not<br />leave his..Some of them are much better off as museum<br />exhibits atleast our future generations will get to<br />see them in good form.</p>

        <p>Hi Vijay,<br />I am surely ignorant about temple sculpture. I spoke more in terms<br />of the thought process of the sculpture.. though there might be so<br />many procedures before installing a sculpture as god...the creator of<br />the idol would have had immense pleasure while he created it..<br />Very similar thought process like Andal had ...happiness that the<br />garland she had woven would be used to decorate the lord...<br />Even till day you will see people happy when the garland they bring<br />is used to decorate the lord in the temple.<br />I spoke about simple emotions/happiness that people have and what<br />kind of happiness sculptor would have had when he knows the idol he is<br />sculpting is going to be installed in a temple.</p>

<p>    Regards,<br />    Vairam</p>
<p>  Hi vairam,</p>
<p>  A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt become god - meaning <br />  its is not treated as moolavar ( if in stone) or utsavar ( if metal) <br />  just like that.... there are a lot of proceedings ( ok - you may <br />  call it rituals) - which are performed to infuse the idol with the <br />  qualities that lift if from being a mere mortal creation to the <br />  plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats with regard to temple <br />  sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.</p>
<p>  as regards the god of man's creation and the man of god's creation - <br />  these are concepts that have spawned entire religions. the question <br />  of who is god is different from is God there.</p>
<p>  so what does god look like etc is for us to see within ourselves - <br />  to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are different schools of <br />  thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and beliefs - a fistfull <br />  of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a handful of clay. </p>
<p>  But the beauty in all this is the transformation was right in front <br />  of the eyes of the worshipper and once transformed the powers were <br />  deemed to be infused into the idol. this is the power of suggestion -<br />  but i would like to disagree on the sculpture being in a museum <br />  just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the eyes of the beholder <br />  and not the location. I can vouch of this personally - a year back i <br />  had such a profound experience - a chance visit to the singapore <br />  museum....reposting below</p>
<p>  We were greated at the entrance itself by a cut out of a chola<br />  bronze - an 11th C Uma Parameshwari. There were a couple of other<br />  chola bronzes ..incl one of Sambandar. There was also a beautiful<br />  stone sculpture of Subramaniar - chola era</p>
<p>  Unfortunately the piece de resistance - the Uma paramershwari idol<br />  was a special exhibit and the guards wouldnt allow us to take<br />  pictures of this one alone...</p>
<p>  The beauty of this piece was breathtaking - more than the aura of <br />  seeing the handiwork of agifted artist over 1000 years ago - the <br />  sheer mastery ofcraftsmanship left us spell bound. statue was at <br />  best 2 feet in height, but the detailing was exqusite...the grace <br />  and calm of herface and love in the smile, the lovely locks of her <br />  hair fallinginto rolling tresses over her sholders..the intricate <br />  ornaments on his neck, the grace of her poise - the gentle sway <br />  acccentuating the narrow waist, the beautiful and elaborate work on <br />  his lower garments..her hands and fingers bring life to the <br />  figurine...it was the pure mixing of artistic beauty with <br />  spirituality - the experience left me spell bound - which is what <br />  the original chola patrons would have wanted the image to do...</p>
<p>  this is the image...</p>

<p>Hi vairam,</p>
<p>A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt become god - meaning <br />its is not treated as moolavar ( if in stone) or utsavar ( if metal) <br />just like that.... there are a lot of proceedings ( ok - you may <br />call it rituals) - which are performed to infuse the idol with the <br />qualities that lift if from being a mere mortal creation to the <br />plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats with regard to temple <br />sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.</p>
<p>as regards the god of man's creation and the man of god's creation - <br />these are concepts that have spawned entire religions. the question <br />of who is god is different from is God there.</p>
<p>so what does god look like etc is for us to see within ourselves - <br />to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are different schools of <br />thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and beliefs - a fistfull <br />of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a handful of clay. </p>
<p>But the beauty in all this is the transformation was right in front <br />of the eyes of the worshipper and once transformed the powers were <br />deemed to be infused into the idol. this is the power of suggestion -<br />but i would like to disagree on the sculpture being in a museum <br />just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the eyes of the beholder <br />and not the location. I can vouch of this personally - a year back i <br />had such a profound experience - a chance visit to the singapore <br />museum....reposting below</p>
<p>We were greated at the entrance itself by a cut out of a chola<br />bronze - an 11th C Uma Parameshwari. There were a couple of other<br />chola bronzes ..incl one of Sambandar. There was also a beautiful<br />stone sculpture of Subramaniar - chola era</p>
<p>Unfortunately the piece de resistance - the Uma paramershwari idol<br />was a special exhibit and the guards wouldnt allow us to take<br />pictures of this one alone...</p>
<p>The beauty of this piece was breathtaking - more than the aura of <br />seeing the handiwork of agifted artist over 1000 years ago - the <br />sheer mastery ofcraftsmanship left us spell bound. statue was at <br />best 2 feet in height, but the detailing was exqusite...the grace <br />and calm of herface and love in the smile, the lovely locks of her <br />hair fallinginto rolling tresses over her sholders..the intricate <br />ornaments on his neck, the grace of her poise - the gentle sway <br />acccentuating the narrow waist, the beautiful and elaborate work on <br />his lower garments..her hands and fingers bring life to the <br />figurine...it was the pure mixing of artistic beauty with <br />spirituality - the experience left me spell bound - which is what <br />the original chola patrons would have wanted the image to do...</p>
<p>this is the image...</p>

<p>    On a serious note, I am not ignorant as far as<br />    spirituality goes. I don't think it is appropriate<br />  to<br />    mix it everywhere and coming up with creative<br />    interpretations. As an example - It is your call<br />  if<br />    you find 'kodi asaidhanadum' as a lofty spiritual<br />    work, just fyi even Kaviarasar never listed it<br />    anywhere in his favorites, just a romantic song<br />  that<br />    is often known in western world as 'chicken and<br />  egg<br />    story, which came first.

We may never what he really thought while he wrote that.</p>

        <p>one thought occurred to me now....<br />Already discussed in Kannadasan thread, 'padaipathanal nanum kadavul<br />than'..if you are able to create you are god...</p>
<p>Then think in the point of view of a sculptor who is also a<br />creator....if he thinks its just stone he is working on, his motive is<br />pure art, he is a creator who creates some thing which has never been<br />in this world(like the god himself).<br />Think about it in another angle if he thinks, he is making god out of<br />the stone... then he becomes the god who created the god worshiped by<br />so many... how good it would be for whim while he works ...to know<br />that the creator of the world is getting a rebirth through his own hands!</p>
<p>Whether you see it as Kal/Kadavul/Kalai ... the sole reason the stone<br />is placed in the museum is to respect the creativity of the<br />GOD(sculptor) who created it.</p>

<p>    Vairam, of course you need to be an adult to<br />    appreciate it fully. Books have changed a lot, i<br />  saw<br />    ninth grade text book it was quite unlike anything<br />  we<br />    learnt. On the other hand, these poems and stories<br />  in<br />    those days were subtle ways of educating growing<br />    children on adult realities, there was no<br />  television<br />    or internet in those days so pondering on what it<br />    means perhaps is a gentle way to waken the adult<br />  in a<br />    child and far less intrusive that modern methods<br />  :)</p>
<p>    My grandmother used to say the subtle practical<br />    intention behind young women chanting Tiruppavai<br />  (to<br />    get married soon) was similar, a gentle awakening<br />  of<br />    adult emotions mixed with devotional rasa,</p>

The emotions<br />      and allusions cannot be surely understood when<br />  you<br />      are kid and a<br />      teacher who takes care that you really dont<br />      understand the intended<br />      allusions! :D ....</p>

        <p>Vairam, of course you need to be an adult to<br />appreciate it fully. Books have changed a lot, i saw<br />ninth grade text book it was quite unlike anything we<br />learnt. On the other hand, these poems and stories in<br />those days were subtle ways of educating growing<br />children on adult realities, there was no television<br />or internet in those days so pondering on what it<br />means perhaps is a gentle way to waken the adult in a<br />child and far less intrusive that modern methods :)</p>
<p>My grandmother used to say the subtle practical<br />intention behind young women chanting Tiruppavai (to<br />get married soon) was similar, a gentle awakening of<br />adult emotions mixed with devotional rasa,</p>

        <p>Vairam: I love tamil and anything that comes along with it. I enjoy <br />all the versions, the third is my best however.</p>
<p>I will keep it simple and those who want to investigate can do it.<br />I can say in a simple cue: Land is prakriti, Tiller is the Paramatma <br />and seed is the jeevatma. <br />The Gita also explains this, I am sure there are experts here who can <br />read between the lines. <br />As with any ancient literature in india, unless one understands and <br />appreciates the philosophy behind it, the literature remains embedded <br />waiting for it to be decoded...somewhere there are people like those <br />who read into davinci code and there are alwys people to dismiss <br />them :-) </p>
