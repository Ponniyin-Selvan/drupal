        <p>Muthu, am sure you and your wife did what was right for your child, according to your priorities. I wish more indians would admit what is important tothem and do the same instead of making excuses such as needing more money,or raising kids 'indian' and so on. I have no issues with people raising their kids abroad as long as they understand what the child goes through, and provide for some outlet for the child's needs for community and companionship. Wealthy gujarati and some telugu families are able to do that since they are large communities settled together. <br />?<br />Children grow up in india with family ties, granted increased modernizationhas perhaps taken away some old values but still no drugs, no promiscuity,and no guns in school. A lot to be grateful for (I think). Am also reminded of Thoreau's quote at the end of the journey we come back to where we started and begin all over again (or something like that).<br />?<br />Bests<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Malathi, you struck a chord there. I lived in US for about 8 years. <br />Mostly in LA(3 years) and in Omaha, Des Moines, Scranton, Greenville <br />and Atlanta(about a year each in these places). My general <br />observation is that people in the mid-west and the south were <br />culturally conservative but were most fun. I was invited for thanks <br />giving dinner in Omaha, Greenville and Des moines by different <br />people. Given that usually the family congregates for thanks giving, <br />I think the gesture made was more than just symbolic. I was living <br />alone in LA before I got married and moved to Iowa. My wife remember <br />the Iowa/South Carolina/Penn days as the best as she made a lot of <br />friends in the apartment community we were living. <br />That said, when we enrolled our son in a local catholic school for <br />his pre-kindergarden, thats when we noticed that my son was not very <br />happy about school and had problems moving with other kids in <br />school. His only friend was a Indian girl in his class. <br />Though we got our green cards by that time, we decided to move out <br />and settle back in Chennai for his sake as much as our sake. Its <br />been 2 years since, I dont know whether it was a right decision or <br />not but I am seeing my son having more friends and more importantly <br />for me, he now is more closer to his cousins and is happy to go to <br />school(I mean, he really likes his school). <br />May be, its just that I panicked but I think I made the right <br />decision to come back. I am planning to settle down back in Madurai <br />may be in another 10 years time. <br />Like I was telling my friends here, I was chasing the dream of <br />leaving Madurai and landing in United states for the first 22 years <br />of my life and now I am chasing the dream of settling back in <br />Madurai for the past 11 years and hopefully will do that in another <br />10-11 years. Life is crazy, aint it?</p>

<p>at home and school. The majority of immigrant parents do not think <br />deeply about raising kids in another culture, they just 'settle <br />down' because they got their green cards and life is indeed cleaner <br />and more comfortable. When children grow up they are shocked because <br />for all reasons children speak in a completely alien accent, cannot <br />communicate with grandparents or cousins in India, and do not share <br />their own sentiments on our culture. Let us face it, cultures are <br />differnt. Although we want a 'vasudeva kudumbakam' we often come <br />face to face with totally different ways of living, almost like <br />people are from a different plant. Immigrant children who run into <br />such differences chooose 'their planet' that is the land they are <br />in, for survival more than anything else. It is immature to think <br />they are 'indians' in the literal</p>

<p>  Hi</p>
<p>  malathi's observations do give us an insight into the problems <br />faced <br />  by immigrants.<br />  malathi, does this isolation also happen at university levels?</p>

<p>    Please let us show some degree of caution while labelling <br />american <br />  indians as indians or for that matter all people of indian origin <br />as <br />  indians. I have learnt this the hard way believe me. Deepak Chopra <br />  once made a controversial statement that he was not a Hindu (after <br />  adopting and explaining several hindu practices and making <br />millions <br />  of $). In the same fashion several american indians completely <br />disown <br />  their origins.

<p>    Jeffrey Archer during his latest tour of India, for promoting <br />his <br />  book, said this "One day every person in this world will be an <br />  Indian". <br />    There are Indian origin players in the US gymnast team, probably <br />  90% of the English cricket team is of Indian origin, etc...i dont <br />  think we are talking about globalisation here.

<p>    thats globalisation for you.</p>
<p>    venketesh </p>
<p>    Whether you<br />      accept or not, it takes a big heart to say that. As I <br />mentioned, <br />    our<br />      own country men do not say 'vande mataram' - i salute my <br />  motherland<br />      and there was a huge protest for this. </p>
<p>      Vivekananda got a 2 minute standing ovation in Chicago <br />religious<br />      conference, just for 6 words..'my brothers and sisters of <br />  america'. <br />    As<br />      far as I know, no country or no religion teaches universal <br />    brotherhood<br />      and this was new to the west and thats the reason for 2 minute<br />      standing ovation. If he had said that in India, its just part <br />of <br />  the<br />      game and no one would have noticed.</p>
<p>      Our scriptures say,'vasudeva kudumbakam' - the entire human <br />race <br />  is<br />      vasudeva's (krishna/vishnu) family, meaning all are brothers <br />and<br />      sisters and there should be love and no hatred.</p>
<p>      So when Kathie said 'Jai Hind', it gave me a pleasant feeling <br />and <br />  at<br />      the same time pain (for the 'vande mataram' incident). I <br />thought <br />    its a<br />      good sign for a true universal brotherhood concept. </p>
<p>      Maybe I am going too far, but when Indian's and Indian <br />politicians<br />      make a mockery of our country/system (you even elaborated on <br />the<br />      sports system) an american saying 'Jai Hind'....I am moved.</p>

They <br />get <br />  teased and isolated mercilessly - and unless the home is very <br />stable <br />  and parents are very mature that often times turns into a strong <br />  dislike and hatred of indian origins.<br />    ?<br />    Bottom line - if someone calls himself of indian origin and is <br />  proud of it fine, being brown skinned and born in America makes <br />him <br />  more American than Indian that is all.<br />    ?<br />    Malathi</p>

<p>    Jeffrey Archer during his latest tour of India, for promoting <br />his <br />  book, said this "One day every person in this world will be an <br />  Indian". <br />    There are Indian origin players in the US gymnast team, probably <br />  90% of the English cricket team is of Indian origin, etc...i dont <br />  think we are talking about globalisation here. "Indianisation" <br />would <br />  be a more apt word.<br />    ?<br />    Regards<br />    Rahul<br />    ?<br />    On 8/12/08, R.venketesh <abhivencat@ yahoo. com  wrote: </p>

<p>    thats globalisation for you.</p>
<p>    venketesh </p>
<p>    Whether you<br />      accept or not, it takes a big heart to say that. As I <br />mentioned, <br />    our<br />      own country men do not say 'vande mataram' - i salute my <br />  motherland<br />      and there was a huge protest for this. </p>
<p>      Vivekananda got a 2 minute standing ovation in Chicago <br />religious<br />      conference, just for 6 words..'my brothers and sisters of <br />  america'. <br />    As<br />      far as I know, no country or no religion teaches universal <br />    brotherhood<br />      and this was new to the west and thats the reason for 2 minute<br />      standing ovation. If he had said that in India, its just part <br />of <br />  the<br />      game and no one would have noticed.</p>
<p>      Our scriptures say,'vasudeva kudumbakam' - the entire human <br />race <br />  is<br />      vasudeva's (krishna/vishnu) family, meaning all are brothers <br />and<br />      sisters and there should be love and no hatred.</p>
<p>      So when Kathie said 'Jai Hind', it gave me a pleasant feeling <br />and <br />  at<br />      the same time pain (for the 'vande mataram' incident). I <br />thought <br />    its a<br />      good sign for a true universal brotherhood concept. </p>
<p>      Maybe I am going too far, but when Indian's and Indian <br />politicians<br />      make a mockery of our country/system (you even elaborated on <br />the<br />      sports system) an american saying 'Jai Hind'....I am moved.</p>

        <p>Yes it is true that it varies around the country and also that it is a new country and so on. Also with globalisation more people travel especailly inIT and find out what it is like for themselves, of course travel it self does not mean a broadened mind but it is one way to develop one.<br />?<br />I believe it is one of the issues with capitalism - that thrives on people making quick and less informed choices. I am not talking of some farmer in Kentucky having ignorant ideas, it is educated people, degree holders - later on I learnt most colored people, not just indians face the same, stereotyped ideas and racist ignorance. <br />?<br />I don't want to disregard the fact that us indians many times hold stereotyped ideas all the time (I have met several racist indians who think their american neighbor is racist but have no problems addressing an african american 'kallu' or having stereotyped ideas about them. But am not sure we are known to be a liberal country either, our prejudices are centuries old and we inherited most of them. It is sad to see the degree of ignorance in a country that is a melting pot of so many cutlures and has little by way of prejudiced baggage (comparatively that is).<br />--- On Wed, 8/13/08, Ravi <ravi_eds@yahoo.com  wrote:</p>

        <p>Ah..Ravi, you have to really befriend and talk to people for all those things to come out. I mean nobody will walk upto you and ask like that. If you be friends for a while you can understand what they know, which is often times downright stupid ideas. I have lived up north too, generally am of the opinion that the average american's knowledge of other countries and cultures is a little pathetic - I don't mean exceptions like our Kathy here. <br />?<br />More often than not it is ignorance, I mean how many indians have ignorant ideas about western culture, same way. But one does get more upset because the avenues for seeking and learning in this country are way way better than in India, so really there is no excuse for ignorance other than that people don't want to learn.</p>

<p>Malathi, I have been here for a decade but yet to meet any one who <br />ask such questions. <br />I believe there is a divide in the regions also in the US which makes <br />some people totally ignorant of oher geo's.

<p>    Hi satish</p>
<p>    dont see the meaning of vasudeva kudumbakam here - can you <br />elaborate.</p>
<p>  Vijay,</p>
<p>  An american saying 'long live India'. Though globalization has <br />brought<br />  the world closer, i thought this is a noble gesture. Whether you<br />  accept or not, it takes a big heart to say that. As I mentioned, our<br />  own country men do not say 'vande mataram' - i salute my motherland<br />  and there was a huge protest for this. </p>
<p>  Vivekananda got a 2 minute standing ovation in Chicago religious<br />  conference, just for 6 words..'my brothers and sisters of america'. <br />As<br />  far as I know, no country or no religion teaches universal <br />brotherhood<br />  and this was new to the west and thats the reason for 2 minute<br />  standing ovation. If he had said that in India, its just part of the<br />  game and no one would have noticed.</p>
<p>  Our scriptures say,'vasudeva kudumbakam' - the entire human race is<br />  vasudeva's (krishna/vishnu) family, meaning all are brothers and<br />  sisters and there should be love and no hatred.</p>
<p>  So when Kathie said 'Jai Hind', it gave me a pleasant feeling and at<br />  the same time pain (for the 'vande mataram' incident). I thought <br />its a<br />  good sign for a true universal brotherhood concept. </p>
<p>  Maybe I am going too far, but when Indian's and Indian politicians<br />  make a mockery of our country/system (you even elaborated on the<br />  sports system) an american saying 'Jai Hind'....I am moved.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Satish</p>

<p>Dear Satish</p>
<p>I hope my earlier post clarified my question better....with all due <br />respects...Kathie's gesture is infectious. infact that is the bane of <br />india now - we have lost the sense of pride - failed to realise what <br />great a land we hail from. this was a reply of mine in another forum - <br />wherein in the name of globalisation ....a friend wrote that sport ( <br />olympics) and nation pride was not interconnected - that reward ( <br />monetary is the goal of sportsmen. </p>
<p>i am appending my responses ( they are in tamil)</p>

        <p>Malathi, I have been here for a decade but yet to meet any one who <br />ask such questions. <br />I believe there is a divide in the regions also in the US which makes <br />some people totally ignorant of oher geo's.

<p>    Hi satish</p>
<p>    dont see the meaning of vasudeva kudumbakam here - can you <br />elaborate.</p>
<p>  Vijay,</p>
<p>  An american saying 'long live India'. Though globalization has <br />brought<br />  the world closer, i thought this is a noble gesture. Whether you<br />  accept or not, it takes a big heart to say that. As I mentioned, our<br />  own country men do not say 'vande mataram' - i salute my motherland<br />  and there was a huge protest for this. </p>
<p>  Vivekananda got a 2 minute standing ovation in Chicago religious<br />  conference, just for 6 words..'my brothers and sisters of america'. <br />As<br />  far as I know, no country or no religion teaches universal <br />brotherhood<br />  and this was new to the west and thats the reason for 2 minute<br />  standing ovation. If he had said that in India, its just part of the<br />  game and no one would have noticed.</p>
<p>  Our scriptures say,'vasudeva kudumbakam' - the entire human race is<br />  vasudeva's (krishna/vishnu) family, meaning all are brothers and<br />  sisters and there should be love and no hatred.</p>
<p>  So when Kathie said 'Jai Hind', it gave me a pleasant feeling and at<br />  the same time pain (for the 'vande mataram' incident). I thought <br />its a<br />  good sign for a true universal brotherhood concept. </p>
<p>  Maybe I am going too far, but when Indian's and Indian politicians<br />  make a mockery of our country/system (you even elaborated on the<br />  sports system) an american saying 'Jai Hind'....I am moved.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Our scriptures say,'vasudeva kudumbakam' - the entire human race is<br />  vasudeva's (krishna/vishnu) family, meaning all are brothers and<br />  sisters and there should be love and no hatred.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>That was precisely why i asked you that question. </p>
<p>1) As per vaishnava tradition - the entire world was born of the <br />golden egg ( hiranya grabha)....the cosmic egg that floated on the <br />cosmic ocean - a creation of vishnu from which sprung brahma ( i am <br />still searching for the story of how brahma sprouted from vishnu's <br />navel - giving him the name naabeeja ....) who then created <br />rudra....Am i right. and that is why the above usage... so if you <br />are using vasudeva as a name of vishnu then the above makes sense... </p>
<p>now coming to say krishna    </p>
<p>2) Please dont mistake me but enlighten me - on the use of the term <br />vasudeva. </p>
<p>In Hindu mythology, Vasudeva is the father of Krishna, the son of <br />Surasena, of the Yadava dynasty. The closing chapters of mahabartha <br />portray a vivid picture of destruction and massacre. distraught at <br />the loss of her sons, gandhari breaks her vow by removing her <br />blindfold and seeing the mass of bodies in front of her - pins the <br />blame on sri krishna and curses the entire yadava dynasty to die of <br />internecine conflict....there is even a lovely amarchitra katha <br />version of this - recollecting from memory now - pl correct if i am <br />wrong</p>
<p>....the yadava youths making fun of a rishi - by posing one of their <br />boys as a pregnant lady ( he bundles a stone pestle in his <br />belly)...the rishi sees though the ruse and curses that he will <br />indeed give birth to a pestle that will the cause for the end of the <br />yadhava clan....the birth takes place and in fear - they try every <br />method to destroy the pestle- to no avail - finally it is ground to <br />dust ( the last piece - with which you hold on to while griding - <br />akin to grating a carrot was left behind)....all which we thrown in <br />the ocean....a fish ate the last piece....the rest washed ashore and <br />from which grew some wild grass....the yadavas were playing there <br />got into an argument ...and they hit each other with bunch of this <br />grass and loo...died... the fish was caught was a hunter who in turn <br />used the last piece to fashion an arrow - krishna had come to the <br />end of his stay here - and was resting under a tree...from the thick <br />folliage the hunter mistook his big toe to be a deer and shot the <br />fatefull arrow....( achilles heel!!) .....so if all of vasudeva <br />kudumbam aka yadavas were illfated / to die....</p>

        <p>Venkat, yes it does everywhere. Perhaps the hardest hit are young children in schools since they face radically different environments at home and school. The majority of immigrant parents do not think deeply about raising kids in another culture, they just 'settle down' because they got their greencards and life is indeed cleaner and more comfortable. When children grow up they are shocked because for all reasons children speak in a completely alien accent, cannot communicate with grandparents or cousins in India, anddo not share their own sentiments on our culture. Let us face it, culturesare differnt. Although we want a 'vasudeva kudumbakam' we often come face to face with totally different ways of living, almost like people are from a different plant. Immigrant children who run into such differences chooose'their planet' that is the land they are in, for survival more than anything else. It is immature to think they are 'indians' in the literal<br />sense of the word although many do seek a connection and community back home especially after they are older.<br />?<br />Malathi<br />--- On Tue, 8/12/08, R.venketesh <abhivencat@yahoo.com  wrote:</p>

<p>indians. I have learnt this the hard way believe me. Deepak Chopra <br />once made a controversial statement that he was not a Hindu (after <br />adopting and explaining several hindu practices and making millions <br />of $). In the same fashion several american indians completely disown <br />their origins. Our identity is not just a biological/geograph ical <br />fact, it is something we accept and integrate as our own.</p>

        <p>I concur with every word Satish has said. It is one thing to appreciate/accept a foreigner for likeing and accepting our cutlure, but how tough that is one can only see if you have travelled and understood popular conceptions(or rather misconceptions) of our culture and how deep rooted they are. I have had educated americans ask me about tigers and elephants on the streets of India, of child marriage and Sati like those things happen every day. <br />?<br />As for that crowd that will not sing 'Vande materam' - well they have to come here and see what that can do in public (of course in private every democracy allows freedom). Try condemning one word of the Bible down south in public. Try arguing about why the currency used every day by every human has'In God we trust' (or better still try not to use it!!!).<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>For me our Tamil lines "Yaadhum oorey, Yaavarum Kelir" sounds really touching that this "Vasudheva Kudumbakam".<br /> <br />In Sanskrit, they see it with GOD.. but in Tamil, we make it more humanized!!

<p>For me our Tamil lines "Yaadhum oorey, Yaavarum Kelir" sounds really touching that this "Vasudheva Kudumbakam".<br />?<br />In Sanskrit, they see it with GOD.. but in Tamil, we make it more humanized!! (ie, it goes sounds good to all kind of people atheist and non-atheist)<br />?<br />:D Vaazhga Thamizh!!<br />?<br />Shri</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi satish</p>
<p>  dont see the meaning of vasudeva kudumbakam here - can you elaborate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Vijay,</p>
<p>An american saying 'long live India'. Though globalization has brought<br />the world closer, i thought this is a noble gesture. Whether you<br />accept or not, it takes a big heart to say that. As I mentioned, our<br />own country men do not say 'vande mataram' - i salute my motherland<br />and there was a huge protest for this. </p>
<p>Vivekananda got a 2 minute standing ovation in Chicago religious<br />conference, just for 6 words..'my brothers and sisters of america'. As<br />far as I know, no country or no religion teaches universal brotherhood<br />and this was new to the west and thats the reason for 2 minute<br />standing ovation. If he had said that in India, its just part of the<br />game and no one would have noticed.</p>
<p>Our scriptures say,'vasudeva kudumbakam' - the entire human race is<br />vasudeva's (krishna/vishnu) family, meaning all are brothers and<br />sisters and there should be love and no hatred.</p>
<p>So when Kathie said 'Jai Hind', it gave me a pleasant feeling and at<br />the same time pain (for the 'vande mataram' incident). I thought its a<br />good sign for a true universal brotherhood concept. </p>
<p>Maybe I am going too far, but when Indian's and Indian politicians<br />make a mockery of our country/system (you even elaborated on the<br />sports system) an american saying 'Jai Hind'....I am moved.</p>

        <p>Jeffrey Archer during his latest tour of India, for promoting his book, said<br />this "One day every person in this world will be an Indian".<br />There are Indian origin players in the US gymnast team, probably 90% of the<br />English cricket team is of Indian origin, etc...i dont think we are talking<br />about globalisation here. "Indianisation" would be a more apt word.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi satish</p>
<p>  dont see the meaning of vasudeva kudumbakam here - can you elaborate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Vijay,</p>
<p>An american saying 'long live India'. Though globalization has brought<br />the world closer, i thought this is a noble gesture. Whether you<br />accept or not, it takes a big heart to say that. As I mentioned, our<br />own country men do not say 'vande mataram' - i salute my motherland<br />and there was a huge protest for this. </p>
<p>Vivekananda got a 2 minute standing ovation in Chicago religious<br />conference, just for 6 words..'my brothers and sisters of america'. As<br />far as I know, no country or no religion teaches universal brotherhood<br />and this was new to the west and thats the reason for 2 minute<br />standing ovation. If he had said that in India, its just part of the<br />game and no one would have noticed.</p>
<p>Our scriptures say,'vasudeva kudumbakam' - the entire human race is<br />vasudeva's (krishna/vishnu) family, meaning all are brothers and<br />sisters and there should be love and no hatred.</p>
<p>So when Kathie said 'Jai Hind', it gave me a pleasant feeling and at<br />the same time pain (for the 'vande mataram' incident). I thought its a<br />good sign for a true universal brotherhood concept. </p>
<p>Maybe I am going too far, but when Indian's and Indian politicians<br />make a mockery of our country/system (you even elaborated on the<br />sports system) an american saying 'Jai Hind'....I am moved.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Congrats to Abhinav for bringing home something that we have never <br />got so far.</p>
<p>Hi Vijay - this is apples to oranges. Usha was yester year, she <br />trained with discipline, i can relate her work to 'Thavam' and she <br />had support from her near and dear, that day India is different from <br />today's India. She is a legend and will always remain one. Going <br />forward, today we have all that is availble in across the globe for <br />our atheletes... the best is available for us now, however we have <br />only one to bring home the top deal. Does the individual however do <br />the 'thavam' model of work ? I believe Abhinav did it, reading the <br />articles on his training.</p>
<p>My .02 cents:</p>
<p>There seems to be various ideologies, socio-political and economic <br />issues that come together in evolving today's youth. Unless a strong <br />high command is available - leading by example, we are headed into a <br />roller coaster time. </p>
<p>The only thing we are close to china is in population at this time.</p>
<p>I can only hope and pray for a stronger youth as what Swami <br />Vivekananda wanted.</p>

<p>  Hi satish</p>
<p>  dont see the meaning of vasudeva kudumbakam here - can you <br />elaborate.</p>
<p>  meantime, on the gold medal - though this a admirable feat ( as the <br />  tri color went up - what an emotion) - but its taken a long time <br />  coming. At this time amidst all the celebration, it time to ask <br />some <br />  questions.</p>
<p>  The official machinery as usual has come up with lots of cash <br />  prices - but its pure mockery. a.S.

<p>  you should publicise all sports - if cricket brings you money, get <br />  the channel to also telecast atleast 1/10th of that time - for <br />  hockey or other sports. similarly even for cricket - the local <br />  leagues must also be telecast - the more open is the game the more <br />  talent comes up. i dont want to talk of sports selection- having <br />  witnessed the rape of young talent in the name of selection by <br />  corrupt officials - </p>
<p>  lastly sports quota - is a lovely scheme to ensure talent gets <br />  rewarded with a stable vocation, but now its become not the reward <br />  by the goal - people play just to get the job and once they are <br />  confirmed they retire from the sport. there has to be some <br />  accountability to the whole system.</p>

<p>Hi satish</p>
<p>dont see the meaning of vasudeva kudumbakam here - can you elaborate.</p>
<p>meantime, on the gold medal - though this a admirable feat ( as the <br />tri color went up - what an emotion) - but its taken a long time <br />coming. At this time amidst all the celebration, it time to ask some <br />questions.</p>
<p>The official machinery as usual has come up with lots of cash <br />prices - but its pure mockery. a.S. Bhindra is already a <br />millionaire. infact he has made sure his son got the best in terms <br />of training, equipment by spending a fortune ( how many can afford <br />such). </p>
<p>when will the government learn to spend money to bring pride back <br />into indian hearts - they have to work at grass root levels - the <br />rewards announced now can be better used if only they can go into <br />promoting sports talent at the school level - else these will be <br />lone flash in the pan - kerela has produced lot of track atheletes - <br />but what has been done there - weight lifting simiarly - archery. <br />hockey....</p>
<p>first things first - the official machinery has to be revamped and <br />people made accountable for performance. it goes without saying that <br />you got to have only sportspersons to occupy sports positions.</p>
