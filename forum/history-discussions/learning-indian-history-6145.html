<p>Below is the mail i had posted in the bulletin board of my company. i<br />posted it as an offshoot of a discussion on whether Indian literature<br />should be included in our school curriculum, along with Keats and<br />Wordsworth and Shakespeare. The response was pathetic. But i thought<br />this very much relevant to our group and its intentions. So, please<br />provide your views on this.</p>

<p>Worst thing is they don't even present North Indian history properly.<br />Glorification of Islamic / Mughal Empire out of proportion (without<br />showcasing atrocities done by them), not showcasing atrocities done by<br />English are some things communists are good at. You'll not find any<br />mention of cultures of Nepal (which was part of erstwhile kingdoms)<br />except that of Buddha's birthplace, no mention of other sub-himalayan<br />cultures (like that of Himanchal Pradesh, Kashmir, Uttarakhand),<br />nothing about tribal cultures of North India. Only things which are<br />there are of UP, Bihar, Punjab and to some extent upper MP and<br />Rajasthan (called as Cow belt in many parts of India).  </p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing about NE, very little about Bengal,<br />Orissa, all of South India, there is little about Maharashtra (that<br />too only because of Shiavji and because he fought with Moghuls), not<br />much about Gujarat (minus that of because of Gandhi which is anyway<br />not history). </p>
<p>So you can say we read history of Cow Belt (old), Islamic / Moghuls,<br />English rule and Congress. </p>
<p>You've mentioned something about lot of evidence found. Is there<br />anything happening about inclusion of these in textbooks? This is a<br />far-fetched idea, but is there any South Indian group actively<br />pursuing this cause? They should really petition the Supreme Court<br />with this evidence.</p>

<p>True to the core Ruchin.</p>
<p>I'm shocked to see how people at the helm of designing the curriculum<br />are indifferent to `other than north Indian' history. While they will<br />counter our argument stating that the evidences for the south Indian<br />empires(and even west/east/central) is very negligible compared to<br />those of their NI counter parts, I would have agreed to their argument<br />if it was in 1900. But now we have come up with so many inscriptions,<br />copper plates and literary evidence, I think it is high time they<br />relent a little and include these as well. </p>

<p>From: Ruchin Pandey <br />Sent: Thursday, August 14, 2008 12:07 PM<br />To: Chandramouli Balakrishnan<br />Subject: RE: Learning Indian History</p>
<p>There is a bias towards only North Indian history in Indian History<br />textbooks. Blame it on only North Indians being at helm of educational<br />bodies like NCERT / <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education" CBSE</acronym  etc. which are in charge of writing material<br />for books (and their communist bent). They are reluctant to change<br />content and don't have knowledge / information about South Indian<br />empires / culture. You suggest this to even eminent historians like<br />Romila Thapar and you'll be blamed for regionalism (while they<br />themselves indulge in blatant regionalism).</acronym></p>
<p>Unless South Indian representation is heard in these educational<br />bodies, we'll not have due presentation of South Indian empires in<br />History textbooks. Not only South Indian, you'll see very little about<br />East / West / Central India (mostly it stops at Kaling Empire and that<br />too because of Ashok).  </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Changing the track slightly. While I agree with including Indian<br />literature as well, I was having a thought about the history being<br />currently being taught in schools.<br />If you see the curriculum, you can observe that starts from<br />prehistoric times, moves onto the Guptas and Ashoka(with the advent of<br />Buddhism),Harshavardhana and then onto the Delhi sultanate and mughal<br />rule and then enters the East India company and culminates with the<br />second world war. While I completely agree with these, I would still<br />prefer the inclusion of the other major empires which have been pushed<br />to oblivion. I refer to the pallavas, chalukyas (both eastern and<br />western), kalinga, pandyas, Cholas, cheras and the vijayanagar<br />empires. I sincerely feel that the people who framed the curriculum<br />didn't do justice by neglecting these. I think these empires also had<br />great contributions to their states and country in their own ways.<br />Many historians during the initial part of the 20th century virtually<br />neglected the region below the vindhyas and this remained the same<br />until K.A.Nilakanta Shastri explored the evidences and wrote on the<br />history of South India. You can Google on him and find out more.<br />We should include these in our history curriculum so that our children<br />come to know of how great our kings were, the culture prevalent in the<br />region and derive pride and passion out of it.</p>
<p>My 2 cents worth. And no offence meant to anyone. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Mouli</p>

        <p>'Indian History' is an active topic, discussed in several groups.<br />The coming decade is sure to change our perception.</p>
<p>Sampath</p>
<p>De-falsification of India's history -- Dr. Subramanian Swamy</p>
<p>Before departing to India after a two month teaching stint at Harvard<br />University, the Janata Party President Dr.Subramanian Swamy today<br />addressed the inaugural meeting of the scholars of the newly established<br />Center for Indic Studies at the University of Massachusetts at<br />Dartmouth. The Center in which the University's Professor Balram Singh<br />and Rajiv Malhotra of the Infinity Foundation are it's driving force,<br />has already received an initial grant of US $ 1 million to conduct<br />research on all aspects of India's civilisation.</p>
<p>In his address titled "De-Falsification of India's History" Dr.Swamy<br />said that at present Indian history text books used in universities in<br />India and in US were first written by British imperialist-sponsored<br />foreign historians and their Indian tutees. These books are completely<br />and mischievously distorted, and since Independence these books have<br />been updated by<br />Communist-controlled scholars. Hence a complete re-writing of these text<br />books is necessary for Indians to develop an healthy Indian identity.</p>
<p>Dr.Swamy urged the Center's scholars to consciously be aware, at every<br />stage of research, the difference between propaganda and scholarship.<br />Scholarship, he said, must recognise ambiguity in data and be<br />transparent in sourcing inferences by adequate references. He gave the<br />example of Megasthenes writing in his Indica that the king in the<br />capital city of 'Palimbothra' was 'Sandrocottas'. Later British<br />historians identified these names as Patliputra and Chandragupta, and<br />declared Megasthenes to have been at the Mauryan dynasty capital. But in<br />Indian history there are two Chandraguptas, one of Maurayan and another<br />in the Gupta dynasty, and they were 1200 years apart. Moreover<br />Sandracottas could be Samudragupta Gupta, the son of Chandragupta.<br />Further, the Mauryan capital was Rajgriha and not Patliputra.Recently,<br />he said, in the Supreme Court in the Rama Setu matter, a whole host of<br />bogus translations of the Puranas and Ramayana was off-loaded by the<br />government. When the translations were challenged by him, the government<br />had no answer. Translation from Sanskrit texts have to be done by<br />spiritually evolved scholars and pandits since every sanskrit word has<br />many meanings.Dr.Swamy said, Indian historians have consistently refused<br />to consider this ambiguity or go against their Imperialist mentors and<br />foreign benefactors.He recalled that in 1968 he had sent a paper on this<br />subject to the Indian History Congress but the organisers not only would<br />not list his paper for discussion but even refused him entry into the<br />auditorium. Let us not have this fascist approach when we de-falsify<br />history, he urged. Let us challenge the Marxist historians by debating<br />with them and exposing their ignorance and propaganda to the world<br />academia, Dr.Swamy added.</p>

        <p>Dear Member,<br />??? The song refers only the Mahabharatha Por. Eraimbadhu - 2 x 5 x 10 = 100 (Gouravas) vs Pandavas.<br />?????? This song tells the Udhiyan Cheraladhan was the Great King,? who helped the Kings of Northern India, during their wars.? Particularly "Ivarodu (Pandavas) ...............Eeraim Pathinmarum (Gouravas). Itis clear enough to understand, that his kingdom was extended upto the limit of Northern Region.<br />??? Gouravas are 100 only. (If you want their names, I will furnish)<br />Vishwak</p>

<p>   We all know the Mahabharata has references to Cholas (besides Pandiyas and<br />   Cheras). They all took part in the great war, and were on the Pandava side<br />   (thank god for that). I was looking for some info, and I found this ISKCON<br />   article that says the Chola ran the kitchen at the war, for the Pandiyas<br />   (would you thank god for that?).</p>
<p>   Here is the link:<br />   <a href="http://www.bvashram" title="http://www.bvashram">http://www.bvashram</a> .org/articles/ 105/1/Mahabharat a-The-Great- War-and-World- History/Page1. html</p>
<p>   The article, by itself is very interesting. But I was wondering, were<br />   RRC's<br />   forefathers good cooks (Thala's thondars are going to rip me apart)? And<br />   were later-day Pandiyas so antagonistic to the Cholas because of the<br />   imperfect culinary skills the Cholas possessed during Mahabharat times?</p>
<p>   Jokes apart, the article says there are references to this fact (hundreds<br />   of<br />   verses, the article claims), in Tamil literature. Any Tamil Ilakkiya<br />   Expert<br />   here who can provide more clues?</p>
<p>   BTW, I found this great post on the PS group, dated Apr 2004, that talks<br />   about references to south indian kings in the Mahabharata:</p>

<p>   too much water has flown under the bridge and we can now do two<br />   things.</p>

<p>   if second way i (sorry) we, can provide you with enough ammunition,<br />   but someone has to taken the baton and run.</p>
<p>   pl list you ideas to spread this awareness.</p>
<p>   sadly lot of people talk ( write) but when we organise something there<br />   are no takers. couple of months ago i was down there and we got<br />   saminathan sir to give a splendid presention on tamil scripts and<br />   sittanavaasal. ...we had 5 in attendance incl sir's wife.</p>
<p>   our reach foundation does splendid work on temple renovation,let alone<br />   monetary donations ( for ligthing oil lamp!!!) even physical work- not<br />   one volunteer from PS came for their renovation works.</p>
<p>   are we willing to commit time, resources to work towards this<br />   movement. it has to be a lifelong commitment not a flash in the pan<br />   outburst. we all have tough careers to balance but to spend an hour a<br />   day on this ( away from the idiot box) is defn possible.</p>
<p>   manam irunthaal maargam undu..its a thankless job but very satisfying.</p>
<p>   instead of blindly apeing the west we can make our youngsters realise<br />   how great a land they hail from.</p>

        <p>I just want to point out tha many iskcon articles are extremely poorly researched and based on convenince based logic. If mumudi kings lived during mahabhrat it would be pertinent to look into timelines for any justification . There are lots of puranic fables that liberally use their names but not historically true.</p>

<p>  We all know the Mahabharata has references to Cholas (besides Pandiyas and<br />  Cheras). They all took part in the great war, and were on the Pandava side<br />  (thank god for that). I was looking for some info, and I found this ISKCON<br />  article that says the Chola ran the kitchen at the war, for the Pandiyas<br />  (would you thank god for that?).</p>
<p>  Here is the link:<br />  <a href="http://www.bvashram.org/articles/105/1/Mahabharata-The-Great-War-and-World-History/Page1.html" title="http://www.bvashram.org/articles/105/1/Mahabharata-The-Great-War-and-World-History/Page1.html">http://www.bvashram.org/articles/105/1/Mahabharata-The-Great-War-and-Wor...</a></p>
<p>  The article, by itself is very interesting. But I was wondering, were RRC's<br />  forefathers good cooks (Thala's thondars are going to rip me apart)? And<br />  were later-day Pandiyas so antagonistic to the Cholas because of the<br />  imperfect culinary skills the Cholas possessed during Mahabharat times?</p>
<p>  Jokes apart, the article says there are references to this fact (hundreds of<br />  verses, the article claims), in Tamil literature. Any Tamil Ilakkiya Expert<br />  here who can provide more clues?</p>
<p>  BTW, I found this great post on the PS group, dated Apr 2004, that talks<br />  about references to south indian kings in the Mahabharata:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Below is the mail i had posted in the bulletin board of my company. i<br />posted it as an offshoot of a discussion on whether Indian literature<br />should be included in our school curriculum, along with Keats and<br />Wordsworth and Shakespeare. The response was pathetic. But i thought<br />this very much relevant to our group and its intentions. So, please<br />provide your views on this.</p>

<p>Worst thing is they don't even present North Indian history properly.<br />Glorification of Islamic / Mughal Empire out of proportion (without<br />showcasing atrocities done by them), not showcasing atrocities done by<br />English are some things communists are good at. You'll not find any<br />mention of cultures of Nepal (which was part of erstwhile kingdoms)<br />except that of Buddha's birthplace, no mention of other sub-himalayan<br />cultures (like that of Himanchal Pradesh, Kashmir, Uttarakhand) ,<br />nothing about tribal cultures of North India. Only things which are<br />there are of UP, Bihar, Punjab and to some extent upper MP and<br />Rajasthan (called as Cow belt in many parts of India). </p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing about NE, very little about Bengal,<br />Orissa, all of South India, there is little about Maharashtra (that<br />too only because of Shiavji and because he fought with Moghuls), not<br />much about Gujarat (minus that of because of Gandhi which is anyway<br />not history). </p>
<p>So you can say we read history of Cow Belt (old), Islamic / Moghuls,<br />English rule and Congress. </p>
<p>You've mentioned something about lot of evidence found. Is there<br />anything happening about inclusion of these in textbooks? This is a<br />far-fetched idea, but is there any South Indian group actively<br />pursuing this cause? They should really petition the Supreme Court<br />with this evidence.</p>

<p>True to the core Ruchin.</p>
<p>I'm shocked to see how people at the helm of designing the curriculum<br />are indifferent to `other than north Indian' history. While they will<br />counter our argument stating that the evidences for the south Indian<br />empires(and even west/east/central) is very negligible compared to<br />those of their NI counter parts, I would have agreed to their argument<br />if it was in 1900. But now we have come up with so many inscriptions,<br />copper plates and literary evidence, I think it is high time they<br />relent a little and include these as well. </p>

<p>There is a bias towards only North Indian history in Indian History<br />textbooks. Blame it on only North Indians being at helm of educational<br />bodies like NCERT / <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education" CBSE</acronym  etc. which are in charge of writing material<br />for books (and their communist bent). They are reluctant to change<br />content and don't have knowledge / information about South Indian<br />empires / culture. You suggest this to even eminent historians like<br />Romila Thapar and you'll be blamed for regionalism (while they<br />themselves indulge in blatant regionalism) .</acronym></p>
<p>Unless South Indian representation is heard in these educational<br />bodies, we'll not have due presentation of South Indian empires in<br />History textbooks. Not only South Indian, you'll see very little about<br />East / West / Central India (mostly it stops at Kaling Empire and that<br />too because of Ashok). </p>

While I agree with including Indian<br />literature as well, I was having a thought about the history being<br />currently being taught in schools.<br />If you see the curriculum, you can observe that starts from<br />prehistoric times, moves onto the Guptas and Ashoka(with the advent of<br />Buddhism),Harshavar dhana and then onto the Delhi sultanate and mughal<br />rule and then enters the East India company and culminates with the<br />second world war. While I completely agree with these, I would still<br />prefer the inclusion of the other major empires which have been pushed<br />to oblivion. I refer to the pallavas, chalukyas (both eastern and<br />western), kalinga, pandyas, Cholas, cheras and the vijayanagar<br />empires. I sincerely feel that the people who framed the curriculum<br />didn't do justice by neglecting these. I think these empires also had<br />great contributions to their states and country in their own ways.<br />Many historians during the initial part of the 20th century virtually<br />neglected the region below the vindhyas and this remained the same<br />until K.A.Nilakanta Shastri explored the evidences and wrote on the<br />history of South India. You can Google on him and find out more.<br />We should include these in our history curriculum so that our children<br />come to know of how great our kings were, the culture prevalent in the<br />region and derive pride and passion out of it.</p>
<p>My 2 cents worth. And no offence meant to anyone. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Mouli</p>

<p>Sorry there is a mistake (as usual) in my post.... Cholas ran the kitchen for the Pandavas (and not Pandiyas as I had written). My obsession with <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  possibly made me read Pandiyas for Pandavas. </p>

<p>We all know the Mahabharata has references to Cholas (besides Pandiyas and Cheras). They all took part in the great war, and were on the Pandava side (thank god for that). I was looking for some info, and I found this ISKCON article that says the Chola ran the kitchen at the war, for the Pandiyas (would you thank god for that?). </p>
<p>Here is the link: <a href="http://www.bvashram" title="http://www.bvashram">http://www.bvashram</a> .org/articles/ 105/1/Mahabharat a-The-Great- War-and-World- History/Page1. html</p>
<p>The article, by itself is very interesting. But I was wondering, were <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 'sforefathers good cooks (Thala's thondars are going to rip me apart)? And were later-day Pandiyas so antagonistic to the Cholas because of the imperfect culinary skills the Cholas possessed during Mahabharat times?</p>
<p>Jokes apart, the article says there are references to this fact (hundreds of verses, the article claims), in Tamil literature. Any Tamil Ilakkiya Expert here who can provide more clues?</p>
<p>BTW, I found this great post on the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group, dated Apr 2004, that talks about references to south indian kings in the Mahabharata: </p>

        <p>Yes vijay. Your observation is correct. I was sharing chandra's<br />concern that seldom people attend the uzhavarapanis, let alone<br />contribute financially to those. I was also guilty to some extent, in<br />that, i was traveling most of the time, almost always abroad. But i<br />would contribute something financially to Reach, whenever it was<br />possible. I was not able to contribute physically, and i accept that<br />and am guilty of that.<br />Now coming to the subject, i agree that we need action and not mere<br />words. We should compile our case with supporting facts, truth and the<br />need for the change. With the number of scholars in our group, we can<br />give it a try, to put forth our point to alteast our state government<br />and lets see if we can see a change, if not now, atleast later.Lets<br />start this right now vijay.<br />we will try to come up with some ideas soon.</p>
