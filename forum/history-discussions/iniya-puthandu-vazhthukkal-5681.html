<p>Hope the new year sees many more great events in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group... wishing good luck to all the <br />new plans that we have ahead....</acronym></p>
<p>Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, after talking with my friend in <br />Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the new year. The happenings in <br />TN disturbed me....</p>
<p>This mail might bring in a lot criticism and opposition, and even the moderators might be <br />requested to delete this posting......</p>
<p>I am also disturbed that the number of mails wishing for the new year is only 2 or 3 <br />compared to the previous years...Hope people got me where I am coming to....</p>
<p>THough i read sometime back that the Govt. is planning to celebrate Thai 1 as Tamil New <br />yaer and not chittirai 1, i didnt think it will be of such magnitude. Its ATROCIOUS to <br />intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote from a few. I was shocked to hear <br />from my friend that all tv channels say 'chitirai tirunal vazhthukkal' (as did one of our <br />member) and not puthandu vazhtukkal..</p>
<p>I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If people say that this group is not <br />the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is certainly in our groups purview. When we <br />say we are trying to protect our culture and history, is this not a big hitto our culture?</p>
<p>'Nenju porukudhillaye..intha nilai ketta manitharai ninaithu vittaal'..beautiful words of <br />Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont have the back bone to fight <br />against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I talked with my friend around <br />1.30 in the night (my time) and i could not sleep further. Wondering where the country is <br />heading.. </p>
<p>Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not even a mention of this in our <br />group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on the new year. If tanjai periya <br />koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest saying that its a hit for our <br />culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?</p>
<p>who gave these people such authority to change religious things as they wish. Will these <br />people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it cam eout of Indiawe should not <br />follow that calendar? </p>
<p>Ravi, </p>
<p>I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu mythology. I used to think in <br />those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I feel these are also mini <br />pralaya's where the dharma is being disturbed. </p>
<p>If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the caveat of creamy layer, our <br />so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will revisit the criteria for creamy <br />layer..</p>
<p>For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the state and the country, say that <br />without these people their community could not have improved, I like to quote Swami <br />Chinmayananda,</p>
<p>'The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they could have donebetter, if the <br />situations were different'.</p>
<p>How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people will be bashing the hindu and <br />their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but who the hellare they to say <br />that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai 1? </p>
<p>Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not on the streets. </p>
<p>Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what should be written in this <br />group. As rightly pointed out by Arun (is that Arun? ) we try to brush things under the <br />carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it and gain and spread knowledge <br />about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan invasion theory is a myth, we still <br />stick to it because talking about it going to create controversy.</p>
<p>And we say that this group likes to bring out true history and preserve culture, but dont <br />spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.</p>
<p>Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from others perspective, this mail is <br />surely not related this group.</p>
<p>God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism...</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

        <p>All,<br />?<br />I am sorry for writing a mail on this topic again, but I would like to clear my stance.<br />?<br />I suppose this is were people mistook me grossly ,,?I said i am in? loos of words ..??Because I jus can understand how people can?jus meditate on the outer facade without concentrating on the Soul.. As Gita calls.... its a Ostrich philosophy.. Where the Atheist thinks he is safe because hehas called others Muttal... Prbly my sarcasm did not work!!<br />I kept calm, only for the reason that I did not want to protract the issue even after knowing that I was mistook, and the same was getting vicious. The argument was getting more political, and I was not concerned to encourageit.<br />?<br />Hope I have cleared thy stand.

<p>/////  One cannot help</p>

<p>  The most effective way to make an illiterate mass to<br />  HEAR (listening <br />  is after that) to what you say could be this. Kind<br />  of shock treatment <br />  for attention drawing. Its like vaariyaar shouting<br />  'Maaaarchhhh. ..' <br />  in the middle of his speech. If we ask him 'Swami,<br />  why did you <br />  shout?', his reply would be 'thoongaravanellaam<br />  ezhundhirikka <br />  vendaamaa?'. Its more or less similar to that. There<br />  may be any other <br />  better way, but periyar thought this would work out<br />  well where <br />  superstition is spread in the name of god. Samething<br />  for slipper <br />  garland for idols to show that god wont punish if we<br />  dont worship.</p>
<p>  Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was<br />  misunderstood. <br />  Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that<br />  these puranas have <br />  good things too. But there are many other people to<br />  explain that. <br />  Periyar's motive was different. If anything makes<br />  the man slave to <br />  another man or spoils his self respect, eradicate it<br />  without any <br />  hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if it<br />  is Thamizhp <br />  pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana fit<br />  into this category, <br />  suggest to read his 'Characters of Ramayana' and<br />  Anna's 'Aariya <br />  maayai' or 'Needhi dhevan mayakkam'. The court scene<br />  in needhi dhevan <br />  mayakkam perfectly fits for today's sethu samudhram<br />  case also.</p>

<p>    Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />    said, TN is one of the most casteist states.<br />  Casteism<br />    is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In<br />  parts of<br />    Kanyakumari/ Nagercoil district where my uncle used<br />  to<br />    live, there are whole villages that are christian<br />  and<br />    muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />    escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />    true fact.</p>
<p>    During EVR's time there were lot of brahmins<br />  employed<br />    with British like Venkat said. Temples were<br />  largely<br />    governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />    brahmin communities particularly widows was very<br />  poor.<br />    All these factors contributed him to start the<br />    struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR<br />  was<br />    alive today he would continue this struggle the<br />  same<br />    way or even use the same language that he did. </p>
<p>    I have shown the EVR site to american atheists<br />  even,<br />    before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />    them on his history and service. They did<br />  understand<br />    but many of them felt in all respect that the<br />  quotes<br />    of 'kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu<br />  mirandi'<br />    were completely outdated with today's times.<br />  Atheism<br />    in the west places huge emphasis on give and take<br />  of<br />    respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are<br />  rewritten.<br />    Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />    hindus. British edited a popular children's author<br />    Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />    wonder, would our dravidian friends consider<br />  putting a<br />    disclaimer, that 'muttal' and 'kattu mirandi' do<br />  not<br />    include many believers who have supported anti<br />    casteism and rational thought? I am sure the<br />  answer<br />    you will get is total silence.</p>
<p>    I would end here, with deference to SPS and forum<br />    rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility<br />  to go<br />    through archives for all that has been said on the<br />    subject but when I do perhaps will have more<br />  questions<br />    :)) Thanks.</p>

<p>      Hi<br />      i for one have come from one of the most<br />  casteist<br />      areas of tamil nadu.<br />      a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news<br />      every year for the <br />      high tensions prevailing during the ther<br />  function.<br />      the government has <br />      cancelled the ther rather than shed blood<br />  sometimes.</p>
<p>      the swarna murthy temple is owned by the<br />  sivaganga<br />      queen, was rebuilt <br />      and embellished with sculpture by the<br />  nagarathars.<br />      but the fight is between the thevar cast and the<br />      dalits.</p>
<p>      where did the bramhin come into this?<br />      the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the<br />  picture.</p>
<p>      this example i am quoting to 'absolve" the<br />  bramhin<br />      community of <br />      creating caste divides in a major part of<br />  tamilnadu.<br />      the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900<br />  -1945<br />      was not the <br />      bramhin if you take village wise.<br />      the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the<br />  moopanars<br />      and the vandayars <br />      in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the<br />      reddiars in mid <br />      tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north,<br />  the<br />      thevars in the <br />      south etc....<br />      they controlled the village temple, they ran the<br />      local school and <br />      generally decided who had to do what. if you<br />  observe<br />      without bias <br />      these caste configurations still prevail in<br />  these<br />      areas.<br />      the aim of the 'justice party' was to target<br />      braminism not in village <br />      level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />      a huge bramhin migration to the city , their<br />      aptitude for learning <br />      caused a huge power shift in favour of them in<br />      british india. the <br />      justice party caused a bogey man. a fear<br />  psychosis.<br />      this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly<br />  propelled<br />      them towards <br />      greener pastures.</p>
<p>      like everybody before i need to put in a<br />  disclaimer.<br />      my family was <br />      closely involved in the justice party in the<br />  early<br />      years.</p>

<p>  The most effective way to make an illiterate mass to<br />  HEAR (listening <br />  is after that) to what you say could be this. Kind<br />  of shock treatment <br />  for attention drawing. Its like vaariyaar shouting<br />  'Maaaarchhhh...' <br />  in the middle of his speech. If we ask him 'Swami,<br />  why did you <br />  shout?', his reply would be 'thoongaravanellaam<br />  ezhundhirikka <br />  vendaamaa?'. Its more or less similar to that. There<br />  may be any other <br />  better way, but periyar thought this would work out<br />  well where <br />  superstition is spread in the name of god. Samething<br />  for slipper <br />  garland for idols to show that god wont punish if we<br />  dont worship.</p>
<p>  Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was<br />  misunderstood. <br />  Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that<br />  these puranas have <br />  good things too. But there are many other people to<br />  explain that. <br />  Periyar's motive was different. If anything makes<br />  the man slave to <br />  another man or spoils his self respect, eradicate it<br />  without any <br />  hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if it<br />  is Thamizhp <br />  pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana fit<br />  into this category, <br />  suggest to read his 'Characters of Ramayana' and<br />  Anna's 'Aariya <br />  maayai' or 'Needhi dhevan mayakkam'. The court scene<br />  in needhi dhevan <br />  mayakkam perfectly fits for today's sethu samudhram<br />  case also.</p>

<p>    Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />    said, TN is one of the most casteist states.<br />  Casteism<br />    is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In<br />  parts of<br />    Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle used<br />  to<br />    live, there are whole villages that are christian<br />  and<br />    muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />    escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />    true fact.</p>
<p>    During EVR's time there were lot of brahmins<br />  employed<br />    with British like Venkat said. Temples were<br />  largely<br />    governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />    brahmin communities particularly widows was very<br />  poor.<br />    All these factors contributed him to start the<br />    struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR<br />  was<br />    alive today he would continue this struggle the<br />  same<br />    way or even use the same language that he did. </p>
<p>    I have shown the EVR site to american atheists<br />  even,<br />    before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />    them on his history and service. They did<br />  understand<br />    but many of them felt in all respect that the<br />  quotes<br />    of 'kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu<br />  mirandi'<br />    were completely outdated with today's times.<br />  Atheism<br />    in the west places huge emphasis on give and take<br />  of<br />    respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are<br />  rewritten.<br />    Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />    hindus. British edited a popular children's author<br />    Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />    wonder, would our dravidian friends consider<br />  putting a<br />    disclaimer, that 'muttal' and 'kattu mirandi' do<br />  not<br />    include many believers who have supported anti<br />    casteism and rational thought? I am sure the<br />  answer<br />    you will get is total silence.</p>
<p>    I would end here, with deference to SPS and forum<br />    rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility<br />  to go<br />    through archives for all that has been said on the<br />    subject but when I do perhaps will have more<br />  questions<br />    :)) Thanks.</p>

<p>      Hi<br />      i for one have come from one of the most<br />  casteist<br />      areas of tamil nadu.<br />      a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news<br />      every year for the <br />      high tensions prevailing during the ther<br />  function.<br />      the government has <br />      cancelled the ther rather than shed blood<br />  sometimes.</p>
<p>      the swarna murthy temple is owned by the<br />  sivaganga<br />      queen, was rebuilt <br />      and embellished with sculpture by the<br />  nagarathars.<br />      but the fight is between the thevar cast and the<br />      dalits.</p>
<p>      where did the bramhin come into this?<br />      the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the<br />  picture.</p>
<p>      this example i am quoting to 'absolve" the<br />  bramhin<br />      community of <br />      creating caste divides in a major part of<br />  tamilnadu.<br />      the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900<br />  -1945<br />      was not the <br />      bramhin if you take village wise.<br />      the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the<br />  moopanars<br />      and the vandayars <br />      in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the<br />      reddiars in mid <br />      tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north,<br />  the<br />      thevars in the <br />      south etc....<br />      they controlled the village temple, they ran the<br />      local school and <br />      generally decided who had to do what. if you<br />  observe<br />      without bias <br />      these caste configurations still prevail in<br />  these<br />      areas.<br />      the aim of the 'justice party' was to target<br />      braminism not in village <br />      level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />      a huge bramhin migration to the city , their<br />      aptitude for learning <br />      caused a huge power shift in favour of them in<br />      british india. the <br />      justice party caused a bogey man. a fear<br />  psychosis.<br />      this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly<br />  propelled<br />      them towards <br />      greener pastures.</p>
<p>      like everybody before i need to put in a<br />  disclaimer.<br />      my family was <br />      closely involved in the justice party in the<br />  early<br />      years.</p>

        <p>hi<br />In the past ,particularly during the sangam period ,ilakkiangal and ilakkanangal for those ilakkiyangal rose.five ilakkanangal.<br />ezhuthilakkanam,sollilakkanam,porulilakkanam,yaappilakkanam,aniyilakkanam.</p>
<p>under yaappu, so many subdivisions such as nilam(kurinji,etc),pozhuthu,porul(karupporul,uriporul)etc are present.regarding this pozhuthu</p>
<p>pozhuthu-sirupozhuthu<br />perumpozhuthu<br />are he classifications of pozhuthu which indicate the seasons.<br />ilavenil,muthuvenil,munpanikaalam,pinpani kaalam,koothirkaalam,kaarkaalam<br />are under .and completion of every <br />kaalam takes some months.<br />if u take thai as the starting of the year it will be an itermediate period of pani kaalam.so it will be somewhat vittakurai thottakurai.also in llakkanam and ilakkiyam if they mention about these kaalangal they firstly use to mention ILAVENIL.it starts from chithirai.so may be the reason for selecting chithirai as the first month.</p>
<p>and another path.there are twelve zodiacs.it is said that suriyabaghavaanstays in each zodiac for a month.and therefore completes 12 raasis.in chithirai his sanchaara is in mesha raasi.and in panguni he completes one cyclein meena raasi.this also can be considered.</p>
<p>but i think this chithirai new year cannot be considered as tamil new year alone.the whole india might have followed the same pattern.because thosekaalams are formulated and followed by tamils and those raasis and all based upon raasis are formulated by aryans.if u just relate the above two u will find that there is a coincidence of the starting month as chithirai.they might have followed the same pattern but with different names just like different versions of diwali(narahaasura vatham,ramar vanavaasam mudinthu naadu thirumbuthal,etc)</p>
<p>but a thing to think,while we have lo........ng distance to go,that is toreach a position that "THANI ORUVANUKKU UNAVILLAIYENIL JAGATHINAI AZHITHIDUVOM" bharathi's lines do we need this change?i think this problem has beencreated by kalaignar just for political reasons.of course there may be some impact.that also will be in this single way only.like us somewhat educated people and "THOSE WHO ARE HAVING NET FACILITIES" will be discussing of this change through net.the result of those discussions will be emergence ofso many older news( i am mentioning about the fights between polotical parties).but the use of them to common people????????????ipdiye nadanthu kondirunthaal entha paathahamum illai,ithu tharpozhuthu maariyathaal entha saathahamum illai.so intha maatrathai tharpozhuthu kalaignar erpaduthuyathu sirchila porihalai mattume kilappi vidum.entha vazhiyil endraal "avar hindu manangalai punpaduthuhiraar?" .<br />i am not criticizing anyone.but i am asking "is this change necessary now?"oru velai saappaadu kedaikaadhavanukku avanukku ennaikku saappaadu kedaikutho athu than new year".evalavo prachanaihal irukkaiyil prachanaiye illaatha vishayathil govt ipdi concentrate panrathu sariya?</p>

<p>Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>what Satish is asking "On what Grounds the date changed from April </p>
<p>15th to Jan 15th..</p>
<p>since no direct answer came so far, I mention :</p>
<p>This date is commenced as Thiruvalluvar Year commencement date.</p>
<p>But there are several quries unanswered :</p>
<p>1. Why the Nomenclatures of the Tamil months remain in alien-to </p>
<p>Tamil language.</p>
<p>2. When the system started.</p>
<p>To the Second query :</p>
<p>We have seen from inscriptions that the Year / Tamil year was </p>
<p>related to Ruling Kings' Ascendancy date..</p>
<p>Here there is another interpretation :</p>
<p>Aandu and Yaandu (Kudanthai Sethuraman).</p>
<p>Hijri - current 1429.</p>
<p>Kollam of Malayalam Calender commenced behind Christian Era and some </p>
<p>were in the 7th Century or so.</p>
<p>Likewise Thiruvallurvarandu is also calculated based on certain </p>
<p>data.</p>
<p>TN Government announced commencement of Thiruvalluvar aandu as the </p>
<p>official Tamil New Year...</p>
<p>Dear Venkateswaran, '</p>
<p>In the light of these when we read the Dinamani article, we realise </p>
<p>that even Commencement dates for these calenders are not FIXED / </p>
<p>ABSOLUTE.</p>

        <p>Venkat, you can delete from archives also, I don't<br />have a problem. If we start a debate we have to<br />conclude it that was my intention that is all.</p>
<p>Kalki himself had no real need to touch on social<br />issues, he was best selling writer of historic<br />fiction. He took advantage of the forum to say what<br />was right. There is NOTHING WRONG in discussing<br />socially important issues that impact every area of<br />our life. As someone said we are scared and want to<br />sweep it under the carpet that is all under the name<br />of harmony and sensitivity.</p>

        <p>Hope one of the moderators just deletes this thread. The argument is getting<br />ridiculous by the day. The group has been started to discuss about <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and<br />other related ones. A once in a while off-topic discussion is good but this<br />is bordering on madness.<br />Just delete the whole thing and lets start something on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .</p>

        <p>AK, I have not ever refered to myself as 'upper caste'<br />and this was only in the context of discussion.In any<br />case my sincere apologies if that reference hurt<br />anyone including yourself.</p>
<p>Of course Kalaignar's ethics figure in the subject, as<br />much as anyone elses. As far as the 'muttaal' issue<br />goes - that is exactly what I meant by disclaimer. It<br />would be good for you too to say I did not intend<br />anytihng personal to anyone who is non dravidian, that<br />is all. That is all what anyone looks for, a certain<br />safety and minimal respect so that we can talk. .</p>
<p>My apologies to the moderators for taking this issue<br />so further.<br />Thank you </p>

<p>    AK, I was hoping to stop but it looks like it is<br />  not<br />    yet time. </p>
<p>    . So the statement was put in to 'wake up'<br />  masses??<br />    How long has it been since masses actually<br />  believed<br />    priests and brahmins? <br />    And how many DMK politicians including Kalaignar<br />  have<br />    taken total advantage of their ignorance for<br />  getting<br />    votes and staying in office? It was a time when<br />  EVR<br />    said that, how many years have gone by? Nowadays<br />  an<br />    average brahmin boy or girl cannot even get<br />  college<br />    admission.Most brahmins like someone said have<br />  gone<br />    abroad to further their living.</p>
<p>    Second I don't think you can group<br />    Periyar/Anna/Kalignar like they all have same<br />  values<br />    and principles. Periyar was from the freedom<br />  fighers<br />    generation, he was unselfish and committed to his<br />    cause. The cause was diluted in Anna's times.<br />  Perhaps<br />    the only thing you can respect about Kalaignar is<br />  that<br />    he is a tamil scholar. He is one of the most<br />  corrupt<br />    politicians there ever was. </p>
<p>    Lastly reasons are not excuses. The fact that<br />  someone<br />    else is poor/illiterate/some way is not mine or<br />  your<br />    excuse to treat others with rudeness and<br />  disrespect.<br />    If you are poor, illiterate, one of those<br />  conditions<br />    and you call a believer 'kattu mirandi' I can<br />  forgive,<br />    perhaps. The fact that so many like you are<br />  educated,<br />    literate people writing on these blogs and using<br />    'those' people as an excuse to propogate this<br />  rudeness<br />    is itself unethical and demeaning.</p>

I am sure the<br />      answer<br />        you will get is total silence.</p>
<p>      It obviously means that only. No need for any<br />      disclaimer. I know many <br />      people who dont get offended by this and<br />  understand<br />      the reality and <br />      necessity of this statement, like our SPS and<br />      Nithya.</p>
<p>      The most effective way to make an illiterate<br />  mass to<br />      HEAR (listening <br />      is after that) to what you say could be this.<br />  Kind<br />      of shock treatment <br />      for attention drawing. Its like vaariyaar<br />  shouting<br />      'Maaaarchhhh...' <br />      in the middle of his speech. If we ask him<br />  'Swami,<br />      why did you <br />      shout?', his reply would be 'thoongaravanellaam<br />      ezhundhirikka <br />      vendaamaa?'. Its more or less similar to that.<br />  There<br />      may be any other <br />      better way, but periyar thought this would work<br />  out<br />      well where <br />      superstition is spread in the name of god.<br />  Samething<br />      for slipper <br />      garland for idols to show that god wont punish<br />  if we<br />      dont worship.</p>
<p>      Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it<br />  was<br />      misunderstood. <br />      Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that<br />      these puranas have <br />      good things too. But there are many other people<br />  to<br />      explain that. <br />      Periyar's motive was different. If anything<br />  makes<br />      the man slave to <br />      another man or spoils his self respect,<br />  eradicate it<br />      without any <br />      hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if<br />  it<br />      is Thamizhp <br />      pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana<br />  fit<br />      into this category, <br />      suggest to read his 'Characters of Ramayana' and<br />      Anna's 'Aariya <br />      maayai' or 'Needhi dhevan mayakkam'. The court<br />  scene<br />      in needhi dhevan <br />      mayakkam perfectly fits for today's sethu<br />  samudhram<br />      case also.</p>

<p>      Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />      said, TN is one of the most casteist states.<br />    Casteism<br />      is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In<br />    parts of<br />      Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle used<br />    to<br />      live, there are whole villages that are christian<br />    and<br />      muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />      escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />      true fact.</p>
<p>      During EVR's time there were lot of brahmins<br />    employed<br />      with British like Venkat said. Temples were<br />    largely<br />      governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />      brahmin communities particularly widows was very<br />    poor.<br />      All these factors contributed him to start the<br />      struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR<br />    was<br />      alive today he would continue this struggle the<br />    same<br />      way or even use the same language that he did. </p>
<p>      I have shown the EVR site to american atheists<br />    even,<br />      before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />      them on his history and service. They did<br />    understand<br />      but many of them felt in all respect that the<br />    quotes<br />      of 'kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu<br />    mirandi'<br />      were completely outdated with today's times.<br />    Atheism<br />      in the west places huge emphasis on give and take<br />    of<br />      respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are<br />    rewritten.<br />      Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />      hindus. British edited a popular children's author<br />      Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />      wonder, would our dravidian friends consider<br />    putting a<br />      disclaimer, that 'muttal' and 'kattu mirandi' do<br />    not<br />      include many believers who have supported anti<br />      casteism and rational thought? I am sure the<br />    answer<br />      you will get is total silence.</p>
<p>      I would end here, with deference to SPS and forum<br />      rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility<br />    to go<br />      through archives for all that has been said on the<br />      subject but when I do perhaps will have more<br />    questions<br />      :)) Thanks.</p>

        <p>There is an unsubstantiated story that EVR himself was<br />a 'secret beliver' in his last days, being fed up with<br />politics in his party and workers. Venkat mentioned<br />opulent pooja rooms in his family, I have heard of<br />that also, from some relatives in Trichy.</p>
<p>This type of twisted argument that slipper garland was<br />to prove God does not take offence is not convincing<br />to anyone. First of all neither Periyar nor his<br />followers ever said that, it is others saying that for<br />them. Secondly there are limits to subscribe to as far<br />as interpretation goes. I cannot slap my mother to<br />prove to the world that she won't take offence. A slap<br />hurts and implies disrespect that is all. If I want to<br />prove she wont take offence I say that first of all,<br />and prove it in less insulting ways if I have to.</p>

<p>    It obviously means that only. No need for any<br />  disclaimer. I know <br />  many <br />    people who dont get offended by this and<br />  understand the reality and <br />    necessity of this statement, like our SPS and<br />  Nithya.</p>
<p>    The most effective way to make an illiterate mass<br />  to HEAR <br />  (listening <br />    is after that) to what you say could be this. Kind<br />  of shock <br />  treatment <br />    for attention drawing. Its like vaariyaar shouting<br />  'Maaaarchhhh...' <br />    in the middle of his speech. If we ask him 'Swami,<br />  why did you <br />    shout?', his reply would be 'thoongaravanellaam<br />  ezhundhirikka <br />    vendaamaa?'. Its more or less similar to that.<br />  There may be any <br />  other <br />    better way, but periyar thought this would work<br />  out well where <br />    superstition is spread in the name of god.<br />  Samething for slipper <br />    garland for idols to show that god wont punish if<br />  we dont worship.</p>
<p>    Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was<br />  misunderstood. <br />    Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that<br />  these puranas have <br />    good things too. But there are many other people<br />  to explain that. <br />    Periyar's motive was different. If anything makes<br />  the man slave to <br />    another man or spoils his self respect, eradicate<br />  it without any <br />    hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if<br />  it is Thamizhp <br />    pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana fit<br />  into this <br />  category, <br />    suggest to read his 'Characters of Ramayana' and<br />  Anna's 'Aariya <br />    maayai' or 'Needhi dhevan mayakkam'. The court<br />  scene in needhi <br />  dhevan <br />    mayakkam perfectly fits for today's sethu<br />  samudhram case also.</p>

<p>      Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and<br />  Ravi<br />      said, TN is one of the most casteist states.<br />  Casteism<br />      is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In<br />  parts of<br />      Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle<br />  used to<br />      live, there are whole villages that are<br />  christian and<br />      muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will<br />  be<br />      escorted out politely to village limits. This is<br />  a<br />      true fact.</p>
<p>      During EVR's time there were lot of brahmins<br />  employed<br />      with British like Venkat said. Temples were<br />  largely<br />      governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />      brahmin communities particularly widows was very<br />  poor.<br />      All these factors contributed him to start the<br />      struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if<br />  EVR was<br />      alive today he would continue this struggle the<br />  same<br />      way or even use the same language that he did. </p>
<p>      I have shown the EVR site to american atheists<br />  even,<br />      before this gentleman showed it to me, and<br />  briefed<br />      them on his history and service. They did<br />  understand<br />      but many of them felt in all respect that the<br />  quotes<br />      of 'kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu<br />  mirandi'<br />      were completely outdated with today's times.<br />  Atheism<br />      in the west places huge emphasis on give and<br />  take of<br />      respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are<br />  rewritten.<br />      Manu smriti is being reworded by many<br />  progressive<br />      hindus. British edited a popular children's<br />  author<br />      Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />      wonder, would our dravidian friends consider<br />  putting a<br />      disclaimer, that 'muttal' and 'kattu mirandi' do<br />  not<br />      include many believers who have supported anti<br />      casteism and rational thought? I am sure the<br />  answer<br />      you will get is total silence.</p>
<p>      I would end here, with deference to SPS and<br />  forum<br />      rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility<br />  to go<br />      through archives for all that has been said on<br />  the<br />      subject but when I do perhaps will have more<br />  questions<br />      :)) Thanks.</p>

Samething for slipper <br />  garland for idols to show that god wont punish if we dont worship.</p>
<p>  Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was misunderstood. <br />  Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that these puranas have <br />  good things too.

The court scene in needhi <br />dhevan <br />  mayakkam perfectly fits for today's sethu samudhram case also.</p>

Lot of old sayings and quotes are rewritten.<br />    Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />    hindus. British edited a popular children's author<br />    Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />    wonder, would our dravidian friends consider putting a<br />    disclaimer, that 'muttal' and 'kattu mirandi' do not<br />    include many believers who have supported anti<br />    casteism and rational thought?

<p>      Hi<br />      i for one have come from one of the most casteist<br />      areas of tamil nadu.<br />      a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news<br />      every year for the <br />      high tensions prevailing during the ther function.<br />      the government has <br />      cancelled the ther rather than shed blood sometimes.</p>
<p>      the swarna murthy temple is owned by the sivaganga<br />      queen, was rebuilt <br />      and embellished with sculpture by the nagarathars.<br />      but the fight is between the thevar cast and the<br />      dalits.</p>
<p>      where did the bramhin come into this?<br />      the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the picture.</p>
<p>      this example i am quoting to 'absolve" the bramhin<br />      community of <br />      creating caste divides in a major part of tamilnadu.<br />      the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900 -1945<br />      was not the <br />      bramhin if you take village wise.<br />      the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the moopanars<br />      and the vandayars <br />      in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the<br />      reddiars in mid <br />      tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north, the<br />      thevars in the <br />      south etc....<br />      they controlled the village temple, they ran the<br />      local school and <br />      generally decided who had to do what. if you observe<br />      without bias <br />      these caste configurations still prevail in these<br />      areas.<br />      the aim of the 'justice party' was to target<br />      braminism not in village <br />      level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />      a huge bramhin migration to the city , their<br />      aptitude for learning <br />      caused a huge power shift in favour of them in<br />      british india. the <br />      justice party caused a bogey man. a fear psychosis.<br />      this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly propelled<br />      them towards <br />      greener pastures.</p>
<p>      like everybody before i need to put in a disclaimer.<br />      my family was <br />      closely involved in the justice party in the early<br />      years.</p>

<p>        Having some familiarity with the tamil movement<br />      in the last 150 <br />        years and read through a few of the books, here<br />      are my comments.</p>
<p>        1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south<br />      Tamilnadu as a <br />        antidote to the active missionary activities in<br />      these areas. Refer <br />        Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a<br />      movement fostered <br />        primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with<br />      the Athinams of <br />        these areas to counter the conversion activities<br />      and promote <br />      Saivism <br />        as an active alternative.<br />        2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the<br />      Saivism is based on <br />        the fact that it lead to the contact with 'low'<br />      castes and the <br />        language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the<br />      'exclusivity' of <br />        sanskrit.<br />        3. This happens about 150 years back and if you<br />      look into the <br />        history of the ascendent 'low' castes/high castes<br />      of these times <br />        (like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc), they<br />      ended up building <br />        temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests<br />      and the pooja was <br />        done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my<br />      Kuladeivam temple is <br />        in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on<br />      my talks with the <br />        poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for<br />      atleast 3-4 <br />        generations. This is also recorded in the<br />      Hardgrave's history on <br />        Nadars and Caldwell's history on Thirunelveli<br />      (both are available <br />        and in print). This is true in any number of<br />      temples built by the <br />        low/high castes for the siru as well as<br />      perunthivangal. <br />        4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the<br />      society in terms of <br />        prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating<br />      the Brahmins who <br />        were already there as the highest caste. When that<br />      was found to not <br />        yield results, they sort of 'rebelled' and<br />      asserted themselves by <br />        building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />        5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most<br />      of you here for <br />        the kind of reaction espoused by DK (the Justice<br />      party before that) <br />        is actually surprising. To understand the kind of<br />      oppression that <br />        went through in the rural areas of southern TN in<br />      the late last <br />        century, you need to read the histories mentioned<br />      above along with <br />        the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references<br />      to it in <br />        U.Ve.Sa's 'En sarithiram', the journals of the<br />      Saveriraya pillai <br />        (who converted to Christianity) etc. It is no use<br />      just expressing <br />        outrage at Periyar without understanding the<br />      context. <br />        Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of<br />      avoiding the <br />        Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the<br />      DK. If you look <br />        into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he<br />      comes from a <br />      very <br />        religious background with a lot of compassion for<br />      the downtrodden. <br />        Only when he realized that it is not possible to<br />      change the system <br />        from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to<br />      break up the <br />      entire <br />        system and built it anew. There his opposition for<br />      Ramayan and <br />      other <br />        established scriptures which need to be tossed<br />      aside and a new <br />        society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />      now.</p>
<p>        The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a<br />      Tamil, for better or <br />        worse and it is not a 'religious fundamentalist'<br />      movement but a <br />        nationalist movement trying to free the masses<br />      from years of <br />        oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />      people together <br />        and build a new society. How much good/bad came<br />      out of it is <br />        debatable. </p>

<p>        PS - As an aside my father spent a day in the<br />      police station during <br />        the 1964 agitations for taking part in a<br />      anti-hindi rally in <br />        Madurai. My grandfather took him out but strictly<br />      forbidden him to <br />        do any such things again. There ended my family's<br />      association with <br />        this movement. </p>

        <p>AK, I was hoping to stop but it looks like it is not<br />yet time. </p>
<p>. So the statement was put in to 'wake up' masses??<br />How long has it been since masses actually believed<br />priests and brahmins? <br />And how many DMK politicians including Kalaignar have<br />taken total advantage of their ignorance for getting<br />votes and staying in office? It was a time when EVR<br />said that, how many years have gone by? Nowadays an<br />average brahmin boy or girl cannot even get college<br />admission.Most brahmins like someone said have gone<br />abroad to further their living.</p>
<p>Second I don't think you can group<br />Periyar/Anna/Kalignar like they all have same values<br />and principles. Periyar was from the freedom fighers<br />generation, he was unselfish and committed to his<br />cause. The cause was diluted in Anna's times. Perhaps<br />the only thing you can respect about Kalaignar is that<br />he is a tamil scholar. He is one of the most corrupt<br />politicians there ever was. </p>
<p>Lastly reasons are not excuses. The fact that someone<br />else is poor/illiterate/some way is not mine or your<br />excuse to treat others with rudeness and disrespect.<br />If you are poor, illiterate, one of those conditions<br />and you call a believer 'kattu mirandi' I can forgive,<br />perhaps. The fact that so many like you are educated,<br />literate people writing on these blogs and using<br />'those' people as an excuse to propogate this rudeness<br />is itself unethical and demeaning.</p>

<p>It obviously means that only. No need for any disclaimer. I know many <br />people who dont get offended by this and understand the reality and <br />necessity of this statement, like our SPS and Nithya.</p>
<p>The most effective way to make an illiterate mass to HEAR (listening <br />is after that) to what you say could be this. Kind of shock treatment <br />for attention drawing. Its like vaariyaar shouting 'Maaaarchhhh...' <br />in the middle of his speech. If we ask him 'Swami, why did you <br />shout?', his reply would be 'thoongaravanellaam ezhundhirikka <br />vendaamaa?'. Its more or less similar to that. There may be any other <br />better way, but periyar thought this would work out well where <br />superstition is spread in the name of god. Samething for slipper <br />garland for idols to show that god wont punish if we dont worship.</p>
<p>Regarding good things about Ramayana, again it was misunderstood. <br />Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar knows very well that these puranas have <br />good things too. But there are many other people to explain that. <br />Periyar's motive was different. If anything makes the man slave to <br />another man or spoils his self respect, eradicate it without any <br />hesitation. As simple as that. No matter even if it is Thamizhp <br />pattru. If you want to know how does Ramayana fit into this category, <br />suggest to read his 'Characters of Ramayana' and Anna's 'Aariya <br />maayai' or 'Needhi dhevan mayakkam'. The court scene in needhi dhevan <br />mayakkam perfectly fits for today's sethu samudhram case also.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />  said, TN is one of the most casteist states. Casteism<br />  is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In parts of<br />  Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle used to<br />  live, there are whole villages that are christian and<br />  muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />  escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />  true fact.</p>
<p>  During EVR's time there were lot of brahmins employed<br />  with British like Venkat said. Temples were largely<br />  governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />  brahmin communities particularly widows was very poor.<br />  All these factors contributed him to start the<br />  struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR was<br />  alive today he would continue this struggle the same<br />  way or even use the same language that he did. </p>
<p>  I have shown the EVR site to american atheists even,<br />  before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />  them on his history and service. They did understand<br />  but many of them felt in all respect that the quotes<br />  of 'kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu mirandi'<br />  were completely outdated with today's times. Atheism<br />  in the west places huge emphasis on give and take of<br />  respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are rewritten.<br />  Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />  hindus. British edited a popular children's author<br />  Enid Blyton for racist comments.

<p>      Sathish</p>
<p>      Having some familiarity with the tamil movement<br />    in the last 150 <br />      years and read through a few of the books, here<br />    are my comments.</p>
<p>      1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south<br />    Tamilnadu as a <br />      antidote to the active missionary activities in<br />    these areas. Refer <br />      Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a<br />    movement fostered <br />      primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with<br />    the Athinams of <br />      these areas to counter the conversion activities<br />    and promote <br />    Saivism <br />      as an active alternative.<br />      2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the<br />    Saivism is based on <br />      the fact that it lead to the contact with 'low'<br />    castes and the <br />      language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the<br />    'exclusivity' of <br />      sanskrit.<br />      3. This happens about 150 years back and if you<br />    look into the <br />      history of the ascendent 'low' castes/high castes<br />    of these times <br />      (like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc), they<br />    ended up building <br />      temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests<br />    and the pooja was <br />      done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my<br />    Kuladeivam temple is <br />      in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on<br />    my talks with the <br />      poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for<br />    atleast 3-4 <br />      generations. This is also recorded in the<br />    Hardgrave's history on <br />      Nadars and Caldwell's history on Thirunelveli<br />    (both are available <br />      and in print). This is true in any number of<br />    temples built by the <br />      low/high castes for the siru as well as<br />    perunthivangal. <br />      4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the<br />    society in terms of <br />      prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating<br />    the Brahmins who <br />      were already there as the highest caste. When that<br />    was found to not <br />      yield results, they sort of 'rebelled' and<br />    asserted themselves by <br />      building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />      5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most<br />    of you here for <br />      the kind of reaction espoused by DK (the Justice<br />    party before that) <br />      is actually surprising. To understand the kind of<br />    oppression that <br />      went through in the rural areas of southern TN in<br />    the late last <br />      century, you need to read the histories mentioned<br />    above along with <br />      the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references<br />    to it in <br />      U.Ve.Sa's 'En sarithiram', the journals of the<br />    Saveriraya pillai <br />      (who converted to Christianity) etc. It is no use<br />    just expressing <br />      outrage at Periyar without understanding the<br />    context. <br />      Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of<br />    avoiding the <br />      Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the<br />    DK. If you look <br />      into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he<br />    comes from a <br />    very <br />      religious background with a lot of compassion for<br />    the downtrodden. <br />      Only when he realized that it is not possible to<br />    change the system <br />      from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to<br />    break up the <br />    entire <br />      system and built it anew. There his opposition for<br />    Ramayan and <br />    other <br />      established scriptures which need to be tossed<br />    aside and a new <br />      society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />    now.</p>
<p>      The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a<br />    Tamil, for better or <br />      worse and it is not a 'religious fundamentalist'<br />    movement but a <br />      nationalist movement trying to free the masses<br />    from years of <br />      oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />    people together <br />      and build a new society. How much good/bad came<br />    out of it is <br />      debatable. </p>

<p>      PS - As an aside my father spent a day in the<br />    police station during <br />      the 1964 agitations for taking part in a<br />    anti-hindi rally in <br />      Madurai. My grandfather took him out but strictly<br />    forbidden him to <br />      do any such things again. There ended my family's<br />    association with <br />      this movement. </p>

        <p>Yes Venkat, am shocked by Kapali temple theft. Temples<br />being without funds is not uncommon nowadays. During<br />my last visit we visited Ooothukaadu, a famous krishna<br />temple, perhaps you all have seen. The archagar there<br />was paid 30 Rs per month. Two years ago, 30 Rs in<br />today's times!! He only opened the temple on request,<br />obviously. </p>
<p>It is my hope and dream someday to adopt a temple and<br />a village around it and retire there. Am only hoping<br />there will be some temples left by the time I get to<br />that age!!</p>

        <p>Hi malathi</p>
<p>the real world he is talking aboput is the status quo maintained in <br />rural tamilnadu regardless of the ravings of the dk that one <br />community is suppressing all others.</p>
<p>you can see it in the daily activities or the annual activities like <br />temple festival.</p>
<p>the dominant caste in 99.9 villages is not the bramhin.<br />its the so called local upper caste.<br />they get the first rights in the temples, they run the institutions  <br />and usually stand for elections too.</p>
<p>if one should honmestly accept these communities lost as much as the <br />bramhins if not more. they lost control of the temples which they had <br />built up over centuries.<br />the systematic lootuing of temple properties and lands started after  <br />that movement.<br />so many temples in tamilnadu with thousands of acres owned cannot <br />even light a lamp daily.<br />yesterday the theft in mylapore temple not many were really perturbed.<br />intha thirudan illai na hr&amp;ce thirudan.</p>

        <p>Just some thoughts about the atheist movements in tamilnadu</p>
<p>periyar also talked badly about christian and muslim gods. but the <br />politicians to ensnare a political constituency quietly left them out.<br />when the periyar movie was screened schools across tamil nadu were <br />forced to take the entire school children for a show.<br />the orders emanated from the district educational officer.<br />kumarakuruparan- this is a fact for i am involved in 2 schools.</p>
<p>in contrast i was wondering then how streets are empty when a <br />religious serial is aired on television.</p>
<p>some of disciples of periyar like rajaram openly rejected atheismlat <br />in life. some like anna objected to periyar marrying a young girl. i <br />personally know some of periyars close relatives in chennai and have <br />been stunned by their oppulent puja rooms.</p>
<p>I am also stunned when I hear of the asset base of the dk <br />organisation, the properties they own especially in trichy and how it <br />has become a closely mananged institution.<br />venketesh</p>

<blockquote><p>  Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />  said, TN is one of the most casteist states. Casteism<br />  is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In parts of<br />  Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle used to<br />  live, there are whole villages that are christian and<br />  muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />  escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />  true fact.</p>
<p>  During EVR's time there were lot of brahmins employed<br />  with British like Venkat said. Temples were largely<br />  governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />  brahmin communities particularly widows was very poor.<br />  All these factors contributed him to start the<br />  struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR was<br />  alive today he would continue this struggle the same<br />  way or even use the same language that he did. </p>
<p>  I have shown the EVR site to american atheists even,<br />  before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />  them on his history and service. They did understand<br />  but many of them felt in all respect that the quotes<br />  of 'kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu mirandi'<br />  were completely outdated with today's times. Atheism<br />  in the west places huge emphasis on give and take of<br />  respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are rewritten.<br />  Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />  hindus. British edited a popular children's author<br />  Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />  wonder, would our dravidian friends consider putting a<br />  disclaimer, that 'muttal' and 'kattu mirandi' do not<br />  include many believers who have supported anti<br />  casteism and rational thought? I am sure the answer<br />  you will get is total silence.</p>
<p>  I would end here, with deference to SPS and forum<br />  rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility to go<br />  through archives for all that has been said on the<br />  subject but when I do perhaps will have more questions<br />  :)) Thanks.</p>

<p>    Hi<br />    i for one have come from one of the most casteist<br />    areas of tamil nadu.<br />    a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news<br />    every year for the <br />    high tensions prevailing during the ther function.<br />    the government has <br />    cancelled the ther rather than shed blood sometimes.</p>
<p>    the swarna murthy temple is owned by the sivaganga<br />    queen, was rebuilt <br />    and embellished with sculpture by the nagarathars.<br />    but the fight is between the thevar cast and the<br />    dalits.</p>
<p>    where did the bramhin come into this?<br />    the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the picture.</p>
<p>    this example i am quoting to 'absolve" the bramhin<br />    community of <br />    creating caste divides in a major part of tamilnadu.<br />    the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900 -1945<br />    was not the <br />    bramhin if you take village wise.<br />    the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the moopanars<br />    and the vandayars <br />    in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the<br />    reddiars in mid <br />    tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north, the<br />    thevars in the <br />    south etc....<br />    they controlled the village temple, they ran the<br />    local school and <br />    generally decided who had to do what. if you observe<br />    without bias <br />    these caste configurations still prevail in these<br />    areas.<br />    the aim of the 'justice party' was to target<br />    braminism not in village <br />    level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />    a huge bramhin migration to the city , their<br />    aptitude for learning <br />    caused a huge power shift in favour of them in<br />    british india. the <br />    justice party caused a bogey man. a fear psychosis.<br />    this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly propelled<br />    them towards <br />    greener pastures.</p>
<p>    like everybody before i need to put in a disclaimer.<br />    my family was <br />    closely involved in the justice party in the early<br />    years.</p>

<p>      Having some familiarity with the tamil movement<br />    in the last 150 <br />      years and read through a few of the books, here<br />    are my comments.</p>
<p>      1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south<br />    Tamilnadu as a <br />      antidote to the active missionary activities in<br />    these areas. Refer <br />      Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a<br />    movement fostered <br />      primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with<br />    the Athinams of <br />      these areas to counter the conversion activities<br />    and promote <br />    Saivism <br />      as an active alternative.<br />      2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the<br />    Saivism is based on <br />      the fact that it lead to the contact with 'low'<br />    castes and the <br />      language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the<br />    'exclusivity' of <br />      sanskrit.<br />      3. This happens about 150 years back and if you<br />    look into the <br />      history of the ascendent 'low' castes/high castes<br />    of these times <br />      (like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc), they<br />    ended up building <br />      temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests<br />    and the pooja was <br />      done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my<br />    Kuladeivam temple is <br />      in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on<br />    my talks with the <br />      poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for<br />    atleast 3-4 <br />      generations. This is also recorded in the<br />    Hardgrave's history on <br />      Nadars and Caldwell's history on Thirunelveli<br />    (both are available <br />      and in print). This is true in any number of<br />    temples built by the <br />      low/high castes for the siru as well as<br />    perunthivangal. <br />      4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the<br />    society in terms of <br />      prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating<br />    the Brahmins who <br />      were already there as the highest caste. When that<br />    was found to not <br />      yield results, they sort of 'rebelled' and<br />    asserted themselves by <br />      building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />      5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most<br />    of you here for <br />      the kind of reaction espoused by DK (the Justice<br />    party before that) <br />      is actually surprising. To understand the kind of<br />    oppression that <br />      went through in the rural areas of southern TN in<br />    the late last <br />      century, you need to read the histories mentioned<br />    above along with <br />      the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references<br />    to it in <br />      U.Ve.Sa's 'En sarithiram', the journals of the<br />    Saveriraya pillai <br />      (who converted to Christianity) etc. It is no use<br />    just expressing <br />      outrage at Periyar without understanding the<br />    context. <br />      Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of<br />    avoiding the <br />      Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the<br />    DK. If you look <br />      into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he<br />    comes from a <br />    very <br />      religious background with a lot of compassion for<br />    the downtrodden. <br />      Only when he realized that it is not possible to<br />    change the system <br />      from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to<br />    break up the <br />    entire <br />      system and built it anew. There his opposition for<br />    Ramayan and <br />    other <br />      established scriptures which need to be tossed<br />    aside and a new <br />      society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />    now.</p>
<p>      The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a<br />    Tamil, for better or <br />      worse and it is not a 'religious fundamentalist'<br />    movement but a <br />      nationalist movement trying to free the masses<br />    from years of <br />      oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />    people together <br />      and build a new society. How much good/bad came<br />    out of it is <br />      debatable. </p>

<p>      PS - As an aside my father spent a day in the<br />    police station during <br />      the 1964 agitations for taking part in a<br />    anti-hindi rally in <br />      Madurai. My grandfather took him out but strictly<br />    forbidden him to <br />      do any such things again. There ended my family's<br />    association with <br />      this movement. </p>

        <p>Sridhar, am not sure what you mean by 'real world',<br />there are lot of very liberal people in 'upper'<br />castes and lot of very conservative 'others. The world<br />is what we choose to see, often times.</p>
<p>I disagree with you completely that being without food<br />is being without faith. That is a misconception<br />strongly propogated by DK. Study the history of<br />african americans and slavery - their faith was<br />strenghtened by their struggle, not weakened.</p>
<p>Let us not believe everything we hear as the 'only<br />way'. Respect and acceptance of diversity is at the<br />heart of every great culture. Even in Ramayana's times<br />athiesm co existed with other forms of faith, only<br />possible if there is give and take of respect.</p>

<p>  You mention " if DK was not there, the rampant<br />  practices of casteisum would have <br />  deteriorated the country". Having lived outside<br />  Tamil Nadu for the majority of my life</p>
<p>  I can say with some degree of confidence that TN is<br />  probably one of the most casteist</p>
<p>  states along with Bihar and UP. And that has very<br />  little to do with Brahmins I think. </p>
<p>  I remember my first day in a school in Chennai and<br />  some classmate asking me "Which caste </p>
<p>  are you from" and for someone who had just come from<br />  Bengal (where nobody bothers about caste..</p>
<p>  one of the few good things to come from Communist<br />  Bengal), this was quite a shock. </p>
<p>  Yes, DK did some good with the whole Rational<br />  movement.. but their Brahmin - bashing has </p>
<p>  become quite irrational. If they are truly rational,<br />  let us see them try and criticize Islam ;) and other</p>
<p>  religions along with the ills of Hinduism. </p>
<p>  Not sure how good an idea THAT would be!</p>

<p>  SPs, I am sorry to disagree. Reading with purpose of<br />  understanding and reading with purpose of trashing are<br />  completely different. If they read the books to<br />  understand, why is it that they found nothing<br />  positive, or could not tell public what was true about<br />  Ramayana and what was not? I have known westerners,<br />  completely alein to hinduism, who read Ramayana and<br />  were very impressed by qualities they found. They did<br />  find issues too but not like the mindset the DKites<br />  had.</p>
<p>  I realize you want to close the thread, as this is not<br />  going to lead anywhere anyway. That is ok. I am just<br />  disappointed that you chose to see one member's stance<br />  only and conclude based on that.</p>
<p>  Noone is disputing the need for anti religious, anti<br />  caste struggle that started with EVR's leadership. But<br />  to continue the line of hate propoganda and label all<br />  believers as 'kattu mirandis' and 'mutttaals' is<br />  outdated and uncivilised. To do away with 'give and<br />  take respect' is even more uncivilised. I have<br />  attended meetings of Atheist associations in america<br />  also. Athiesm by itself one is not a beleif system -<br />  most athiests believe either in science, aliens,<br />  something alternate, just calling 'kadavul illai' is<br />  not what one believes in. Second in western countries<br />  you can get sued for verbal abuse if you call the<br />  other person 'muttal' and 'kattumirandi'. If you think<br />  they abuse you with their beliefs substantiate that<br />  and attack the abuse, not the belief system.</p>
<p>  I am stopping here, and again am very disappointed<br />  that a balance is not brought to this debate before<br />  conclusion. It makes me very hesitant to share views<br />  on similar subjects any more.</p>

        <p>Muthu, great information, thank you!! I am aware of<br />EVR's background and what prompted him but the<br />information on Shaivism and Tamil language was very<br />enlightening.</p>

<p>  Having some familiarity with the tamil movement in<br />  the last 150 <br />  years and read through a few of the books, here are<br />  my comments.</p>
<p>  1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south<br />  Tamilnadu as a <br />  antidote to the active missionary activities in<br />  these areas. Refer <br />  Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a movement<br />  fostered <br />  primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with<br />  the Athinams of <br />  these areas to counter the conversion activities and<br />  promote Saivism <br />  as an active alternative.<br />  2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the<br />  Saivism is based on <br />  the fact that it lead to the contact with 'low'<br />  castes and the <br />  language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the<br />  'exclusivity' of <br />  sanskrit.<br />  3. This happens about 150 years back and if you look<br />  into the <br />  history of the ascendent 'low' castes/high castes of<br />  these times <br />  (like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc), they<br />  ended up building <br />  temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests and<br />  the pooja was <br />  done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my<br />  Kuladeivam temple is <br />  in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on my<br />  talks with the <br />  poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for<br />  atleast 3-4 <br />  generations. This is also recorded in the<br />  Hardgrave's history on <br />  Nadars and Caldwell's history on Thirunelveli (both<br />  are available <br />  and in print). This is true in any number of temples<br />  built by the <br />  low/high castes for the siru as well as<br />  perunthivangal. <br />  4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the<br />  society in terms of <br />  prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating<br />  the Brahmins who <br />  were already there as the highest caste. When that<br />  was found to not <br />  yield results, they sort of 'rebelled' and asserted<br />  themselves by <br />  building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />  5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most<br />  of you here for <br />  the kind of reaction espoused by DK (the Justice<br />  party before that) <br />  is actually surprising. To understand the kind of<br />  oppression that <br />  went through in the rural areas of southern TN in<br />  the late last <br />  century, you need to read the histories mentioned<br />  above along with <br />  the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references to<br />  it in <br />  U.Ve.Sa's 'En sarithiram', the journals of the<br />  Saveriraya pillai <br />  (who converted to Christianity) etc. It is no use<br />  just expressing <br />  outrage at Periyar without understanding the<br />  context. <br />  Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of<br />  avoiding the <br />  Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the<br />  DK. If you look <br />  into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he<br />  comes from a very <br />  religious background with a lot of compassion for<br />  the downtrodden. <br />  Only when he realized that it is not possible to<br />  change the system <br />  from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to<br />  break up the entire <br />  system and built it anew. There his opposition for<br />  Ramayan and other <br />  established scriptures which need to be tossed aside<br />  and a new <br />  society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />  now.</p>
<p>  The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a Tamil,<br />  for better or <br />  worse and it is not a 'religious fundamentalist'<br />  movement but a <br />  nationalist movement trying to free the masses from<br />  years of <br />  oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />  people together <br />  and build a new society. How much good/bad came out<br />  of it is <br />  debatable. </p>

<p>  PS - As an aside my father spent a day in the police<br />  station during <br />  the 1964 agitations for taking part in a anti-hindi<br />  rally in <br />  Madurai. My grandfather took him out but strictly<br />  forbidden him to <br />  do any such things again. There ended my family's<br />  association with <br />  this movement. </p>

<p>    Since I could not lay my hands on any of the<br />  information <br />  pertaining to<br />    the basis of Jan 14 being tamil new year (again i<br />  should admit I <br />  might<br />    not be doing a good search), I started searching<br />  for Maraimalai<br />    adigal, since he was one of the key person in the<br />  1921 convention.</p>
<p>    Not much I could get, but came across an<br />  interesting book by <br />  Sumathi<br />    ramaswamy, titled 'Passion of the Tongue -<br />  Language Devotion in <br />  Tamil<br />    India, 1891&#150;1970' published in the year 1997. This<br />  book is <br />  available<br />    in the link below -</p>
<p><a href="http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol" title="http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol">http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol</a></p>
<p>    I didnt go through the entire book, but a quick<br />  scan on a few <br />  pages, i<br />    got something. I should admit, my understanding<br />  could be totally <br />  wrong<br />    or I would have missed the context. Scholars in<br />  this group can <br />  correct me.</p>
<p>    - The need for Tamil Passion came as an offshoot<br />  of religious<br />    fundamentalism. If I understand right,<br />  anti-brahminism<br />    - Indian National Congress was full of active<br />  brahmins and the<br />    non-brahmin community feared this prosperity of<br />  brahmins.<br />    - To alienate the brahmins or the aryan influence,<br />  a need was felt <br />  to<br />    come out with a Tamil based culture - glorifying<br />  Tamil, calling <br />  tamil<br />    as 'Taniththamizh' (without mix of Sanskrit),<br />  'theivath thamizh'<br />    taking the language to godliness.<br />    - This continued to the movement to clear tamil of<br />  other langauge <br />  mix,<br />    like english, sanskrit and persian (?) and make<br />  the tamil language<br />    pure. Thats when pure tamil movement was started<br />    - Many stalwarts including Maraimalai adigal were<br />  part of this<br />    movement. they were not atheist but said that siva<br />  is a tamil god <br />  and<br />    not a aryan god. This gave raise to the Saiva<br />  sidhantham. later<br />    Periya, Anna et al are said to have adopted this<br />  thani tamil<br />    ideology.This gave raise to the draidian movement.<br />  (but I am not <br />  sure<br />    how the atheism came in)</p>
<p>    Good to know that Maraimalai adigal has published<br />  nearly 54 books,<br />    both in english and tamil.</p>
<p>    Someon said that only mylapore ,mambalam people<br />  accepted aryan </p>

        <p>SPS, scholars are rarely acceptable to masses, the<br />vast majority of masses are illiterate people who live<br />hand to mouth existence, what do they care about<br />whether their leader is tamil scholar or not?</p>
<p>I don't know what context you mean - but I have always<br />maintaned mass popularity in any cutlure and any<br />country does not mean anything in particular. I mean<br />it could be certain qualities the person has, good<br />qualities but there are hundreds of people with<br />similar qualities. Like MGR was a good philanthropist,<br />how many people there are who do 'quiet donations' all<br />the time and are never talked about? There is a big<br />element of luck to why people become famous among<br />common man. I don't know if you mean anything else but<br />just my 2 cents.</p>
<p>Regarding posts being unrelated to subject matter,<br />that is a fairly common occurence on blogs and group<br />emails.</p>

<p>  Dear Satish,</p>
<p>  I was thinking aloud on this subject, since you<br />  opened saying " let <br />  us not say this is not the forum to discuss ..."</p>
<p>  But to discuss, several essential facts needed ..</p>
<p>  And primarily religeous and Cultural outfits should<br />  have opened <br />  their views... surprisingly very less..</p>
<p>  Let me put one question straight ::</p>
<p>  WHOM DO YOU THINK IS THE ACKNOWLEDGED TAMIL SCHOLAR<br />  IN TODAY'S <br />  TAMIL <br />  WORLD ..OTHER THAN DOCTOR KALAIGNAR ?</p>
<p>  Atleast put 5 names for comparison ..</p>
<p>  Mu Va<br />  Thae Po Mee<br />  Bharathi Dasan<br />  Parithimal Kalaignar<br />  Ma Po Sivagnam <br />  Kripananda Variyar ..... all gone</p>
<p>  My Tamil Professor Dr.SATHIYA SEELAN (tamil) is a<br />  Living Legend ..</p>
<p>  Kavipperasu is my very good friend... </p>
<p>  There are Scholarly Professors very good at Tamil<br />  language ..</p>
<p>  But with due regards to most of them, are they<br />  acceptable to the <br />  Mass ?</p>
<p>  I prefer to keep POLITY out of this .. since no<br />  Political gain <br />  is apparently by this.</p>
<p>  I am yet to get convinced What Prabava - Vibhava<br />  ---- Sarvajithu - <br />  Sarvadhari (tamil years) have to do with Tamil !</p>
<p>  regards/ sps</p>
<p>  =========================<br />  Hi Malathi,</p>
<p>  The points are covered .. </p>
<p>  Satish came out with another fresh round ..and<br />  exclaimed HE was not <br />  aware of certain things ...</p>
<p>  There were two responses :</p>
<p>  1. Dear Member Kumaraguruparan replied whether<br />  Innocence / Pretence ?</p>
<p>  2. Respected Member Muthukumar ( pls go through<br />  Archives .. so his <br />  postings on Far-East culture etc., etc., studded<br />  with informations ) <br />  gave an account of Events .. covering a span of<br />  about 150 years..</p>
<p>  Now PLS READ THE SUBJECT AGAIN..</p>
<p>  INIYA PUTHANDU VAAZHTHUKKAL ..</p>
<p>  Is the mail flow in that Direction really ???</p>
<p>  up..</p>
<p>  Mr. Muthukumar cautiously chose the words.. That is<br />  why I did not go <br />  into content of his mail, but in a way supplimented<br />  ...</p>
<p>  -----------------------------</p>
<p>  I am stopping here, and again am very disappointed<br />  that a balance is not brought to this debate before<br />  conclusion. It makes me very hesitant to share<br />  views<br />  on similar subjects any more.<br />  ==============================</p>
<p>  I am sure you have acknowledged the sensitivity of<br />  the subject <br />  already ..</p>
<p>  There are ample fresh things to discuss, share and<br />  cherish..</p>
<p>  Let us look forward ..</p>
<p>  NOW IN GENERAL I AM ALSO DISAPPOINTED THAT :</p>
<p>  Indira Vizha - Chithra Pournami + Rohini combination<br />  ... the <br />  romantic idea of the Tamils more than 2000 years,<br />  posted in my <br />  earlier mail ... has gone un-noticed .... !</p>
<p>  regards / sps</p>
<p>  If they read the books to<br />    understand, why is it that they found nothing<br />    positive, or could not tell public what was true<br />  about<br />    Ramayana and what was not? I have known<br />  westerners,<br />    completely alein to hinduism, who read Ramayana<br />  and<br />    were very impressed by qualities they found. They<br />  did<br />    find issues too but not like the mindset the<br />  DKites<br />    had.</p>
<p>    I realize you want to close the thread, as this is<br />  not<br />    going to lead anywhere anyway. That is ok. I am<br />  just<br />    disappointed that you chose to see one member's<br />  stance<br />    only and conclude based on that.</p>
<p>    Noone is disputing the need for anti religious,<br />  anti<br />    caste struggle that started with EVR's leadership.<br />  But<br />    to continue the line of hate propoganda and label<br />  all<br />    believers as 'kattu mirandis' and 'mutttaals' is<br />    outdated and uncivilised. To do away with 'give<br />  and<br />    take respect' is even more uncivilised. I have<br />    attended meetings of Atheist associations in<br />  america<br />    also. Athiesm by itself one is not a beleif system<br />  -<br />    most athiests believe either in science, aliens,<br />    something alternate, just calling 'kadavul illai'<br />  is<br />    not what one believes in. Second in western<br />  countries<br />    you can get sued for verbal abuse if you call the<br />    other person 'muttal' and 'kattumirandi'. If you<br />  think<br />    they abuse you with their beliefs substantiate<br />  that<br />    and attack the abuse, not the belief system.</p>

        <p>Thanks Venkat. Yes I agree with what you and Ravi<br />said, TN is one of the most casteist states. Casteism<br />is not limited to Brahmins or even Hindus. In parts of<br />Kanyakumari/Nagercoil district where my uncle used to<br />live, there are whole villages that are christian and<br />muslim. Even if you wear a bindi ther you will be<br />escorted out politely to village limits. This is a<br />true fact.</p>
<p>During EVR's time there were lot of brahmins employed<br />with British like Venkat said. Temples were largely<br />governed by them too, and treatment of women in<br />brahmin communities particularly widows was very poor.<br />All these factors contributed him to start the<br />struggle as anti brahmin. I seriously doubt if EVR was<br />alive today he would continue this struggle the same<br />way or even use the same language that he did. </p>
<p>I have shown the EVR site to american atheists even,<br />before this gentleman showed it to me, and briefed<br />them on his history and service. They did understand<br />but many of them felt in all respect that the quotes<br />of 'kadulavai nambubavan muttaal and kattu mirandi'<br />were completely outdated with today's times. Atheism<br />in the west places huge emphasis on give and take of<br />respect. Lot of old sayings and quotes are rewritten.<br />Manu smriti is being reworded by many progressive<br />hindus. British edited a popular children's author<br />Enid Blyton for racist comments. One cannot help<br />wonder, would our dravidian friends consider putting a<br />disclaimer, that 'muttal' and 'kattu mirandi' do not<br />include many believers who have supported anti<br />casteism and rational thought? I am sure the answer<br />you will get is total silence.</p>
<p>I would end here, with deference to SPS and forum<br />rules. My time does not allow enough flexibility to go<br />through archives for all that has been said on the<br />subject but when I do perhaps will have more questions<br />:)) Thanks.</p>

<p>  this example i am quoting to 'absolve" the bramhin<br />  community of <br />  creating caste divides in a major part of tamilnadu.<br />  the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900 -1945<br />  was not the <br />  bramhin if you take village wise.<br />  the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the moopanars<br />  and the vandayars <br />  in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the<br />  reddiars in mid <br />  tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north, the<br />  thevars in the <br />  south etc....<br />  they controlled the village temple, they ran the<br />  local school and <br />  generally decided who had to do what. if you observe<br />  without bias <br />  these caste configurations still prevail in these<br />  areas.<br />  the aim of the 'justice party' was to target<br />  braminism not in village <br />  level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />  a huge bramhin migration to the city , their<br />  aptitude for learning <br />  caused a huge power shift in favour of them in<br />  british india. the <br />  justice party caused a bogey man. a fear psychosis.<br />  this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly propelled<br />  them towards <br />  greener pastures.</p>
<p>  like everybody before i need to put in a disclaimer.<br />  my family was <br />  closely involved in the justice party in the early<br />  years.</p>

<p>    Having some familiarity with the tamil movement<br />  in the last 150 <br />    years and read through a few of the books, here<br />  are my comments.</p>
<p>    1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south<br />  Tamilnadu as a <br />    antidote to the active missionary activities in<br />  these areas. Refer <br />    Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a<br />  movement fostered <br />    primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with<br />  the Athinams of <br />    these areas to counter the conversion activities<br />  and promote <br />  Saivism <br />    as an active alternative.<br />    2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the<br />  Saivism is based on <br />    the fact that it lead to the contact with 'low'<br />  castes and the <br />    language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the<br />  'exclusivity' of <br />    sanskrit.<br />    3. This happens about 150 years back and if you<br />  look into the <br />    history of the ascendent 'low' castes/high castes<br />  of these times <br />    (like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc), they<br />  ended up building <br />    temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests<br />  and the pooja was <br />    done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my<br />  Kuladeivam temple is <br />    in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on<br />  my talks with the <br />    poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for<br />  atleast 3-4 <br />    generations. This is also recorded in the<br />  Hardgrave's history on <br />    Nadars and Caldwell's history on Thirunelveli<br />  (both are available <br />    and in print). This is true in any number of<br />  temples built by the <br />    low/high castes for the siru as well as<br />  perunthivangal. <br />    4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the<br />  society in terms of <br />    prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating<br />  the Brahmins who <br />    were already there as the highest caste. When that<br />  was found to not <br />    yield results, they sort of 'rebelled' and<br />  asserted themselves by <br />    building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />    5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most<br />  of you here for <br />    the kind of reaction espoused by DK (the Justice<br />  party before that) <br />    is actually surprising. To understand the kind of<br />  oppression that <br />    went through in the rural areas of southern TN in<br />  the late last <br />    century, you need to read the histories mentioned<br />  above along with <br />    the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references<br />  to it in <br />    U.Ve.Sa's 'En sarithiram', the journals of the<br />  Saveriraya pillai <br />    (who converted to Christianity) etc. It is no use<br />  just expressing <br />    outrage at Periyar without understanding the<br />  context. <br />    Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of<br />  avoiding the <br />    Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the<br />  DK. If you look <br />    into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he<br />  comes from a <br />  very <br />    religious background with a lot of compassion for<br />  the downtrodden. <br />    Only when he realized that it is not possible to<br />  change the system <br />    from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to<br />  break up the <br />  entire <br />    system and built it anew. There his opposition for<br />  Ramayan and <br />  other <br />    established scriptures which need to be tossed<br />  aside and a new <br />    society to be built. We know what happened to that<br />  now.</p>
<p>    The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a<br />  Tamil, for better or <br />    worse and it is not a 'religious fundamentalist'<br />  movement but a <br />    nationalist movement trying to free the masses<br />  from years of <br />    oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the<br />  people together <br />    and build a new society. How much good/bad came<br />  out of it is <br />    debatable. </p>

<p>    PS - As an aside my father spent a day in the<br />  police station during <br />    the 1964 agitations for taking part in a<br />  anti-hindi rally in <br />    Madurai. My grandfather took him out but strictly<br />  forbidden him to <br />    do any such things again. There ended my family's<br />  association with <br />    this movement. </p>

        <p>Thanks Vijay , that was a wonderful narration, <br />i had know a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  about the Muslim invasion in down south, but not in detailas you have given in your mail.</p>
<p>I suppose this community is named after a Great King, called Raja Raja Cholan, whom himself built such a great monument in Tanjai. <br />It was love for God which pursued him to construct that temple in such a magnificent scale. With such a big temple was to sing, to dance and relish almighty?s names, and if this is to termed ?Muttal? or Katumirandi??I am in loose of words. </p>
<p>As rightly pointed out by Malathi, the discussion out of this is not going to lead anywhere and it might prbly dig and salt the old wounds.<br />I am a Tamil and i proudly say it so...i don?t care weather any body would consider me Tamil or not since because i hail from a particular community. <br />We have thousand things to cherish upon like Divaya prabandham, Thrivaimozhi, Devaram and N number of things..

<blockquote><p>  Now let us slightly go back to POST GAZNI - or Malik Gafur in <br />  Southern India (say 1350 AD) Just prior to Vijayanagara (in about <br />  1500 AD)!</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear sps</p>
<p>Just today i was seeing this reference... talk of <br />coincidences. ....also venkat your madurai - when is it going to come <br />out in tamil...</p>
<p>1311C.E.- Attacks by Malik Kafur, the general of Allauddin Khilji: </p>
<p>According the traditional accounts, the Muslim army lead by Malik <br />Kafur entered the Srirangam temple throught the northern gateway of <br />the 3rd enclosure. The resistance of the Brahmins was overcome <br />easily, the treasury and the storehouse were plundered and numerous <br />icons were desecrated and destroyed. Malik Kafur?s foray however did <br />not last long and soon, he retreated to the north with all the <br />treasure he had looted from the temples of South India. The temple <br />rituals resumed as before after the Muslim army retreated.</p>
<p>1323 C.E.- Ulugh Khan?s expedition and the sack of Srirangam temple: </p>
<p>Ghiyas-ud-din Tuglaq, the Sultan of Delhi, deputed his eldest son <br />Ulugh Khan to invade the Hindu kingdoms of South India in 1321 C.E. <br />When the Muslim army of Ulugh Khan was close to the Srirangam <br />temple, a festival was being conducted, in the course of which the <br />procession image of Lord Ranganath was taken to a nearby shrine. The <br />gathered devotees decided to keep the image where it was and the <br />festival was continued. When the invaders reached Samayapuram, <br />Srirangarajanathan Vaduldesika, a senior official of the temple, <br />decided that no time was to be lost, and commanding the 12000 <br />ascetics who had gathered there not to disperse, he sent away the <br />procession image of the deity in the southern direction secretly, <br />with Pillai Lokacarya as the guide of the secret party. Then, he <br />dispatched secretly the image of Sriranga Nacciyar and a few boxes <br />of treasure with a few attendants to a safe place, locked the doors <br />of the sanctum sanctorum, barred the doorways of the shrines of both <br />Lord Ranganayaka and Devi Ranganayika, placed pseudo images outside <br />and then fled to the shrine of Panvijavian. The invading army <br />desecrated the shrine, killed all the 12000 ascetics, including the <br />great scholar Sri Sundarsana Bhatta. Another sage, Sri Vedanta <br />Desika, hid himself amongst the corpses together with the sole <br />manuscript of the Srutaprakasika, the magnum opus of Sri Sudarsana, <br />and also the latter?s two sons. When the massacre was over, they <br />fled to Satyamangalam in Mysore, where Sri Vedanta Desika published <br />the Srutaprakasika. It is said that the image was finally housed in <br />the protected sanctuary of Tirupati, unfortunately after Pillai <br />Lokacarya died of shock when he heard of the slaughter of his kith <br />and kin at Srirangam.</p>
<p>The Muslim army occupied the temple precincts and put and an end to <br />Hindu worship. A temple courtesan, who fascinated the invading <br />general, prevailed upon him not to destroy the temple altogether, <br />and restrict his vandalism to the destruction of a few cornices. The <br />Brahmins in the surrounding areas tried to perform the sacred <br />rituals whenever they could, but were harassed by the occupying <br />Muslim forces constantly. The general was constantly attacked by <br />disease as long as he remained in the temple, and so he moved to the <br />nearby Poysalesvara temple, which he destroyed and erected a <br />fortress at its place. </p>
<p>The tale of sack of Srirangam cannot be complete without the mention <br />of the sacrifice of the temple courtesan. Unable to bear the <br />harassment of the devotees by the Muslims, she enticed the Muslim <br />chief, took him up a temple tower in the east, and in the pretext of <br />showing him a famous icon from there, she pushed him down and killed <br />him. Scared that she will be tortured by the Muslims as a result of <br />her deed, she threw herself also down. According to tradition, to <br />honor her memory, the funeral pyres of temple courtesans are lit by <br />fire brought from the temple kitchen.</p>
<p>In 1371 C.E., the newly founded Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar wrested <br />back Srirangam from Muslim control, and re-installed the icon hidden <br />at Tirupati with full ceremonies and processions.</p>
<p>1752-1758 C.E.- Depredations by the French:</p>
<p>During these 6 years, the temple was under the occupation of the <br />French, who ruled from Pondicherry. They plundered the temple, and <br />were planning on harassing the entire population that had taken <br />refuge in the shrine, when an old Frenchman pleaded for mercy on <br />behalf of the local inhabitants. Numerous accounts exist of the <br />harassment of the inhabitants of the nearby areas by the occupying <br />troops, including the molestation of women. The inner precincts of <br />the temple were saved from desecration by 1000 Rajput soldiers of <br />the army of Chanda Saheb. </p>
<p>1781 C.E.- The threat of another sack by Haider Ali:</p>
<p>Haider Ali was the Muslim ruler of Mysore, who invaded Srirangam in <br />1781, devastating territories en route. The inhabitants of the <br />region sought refuge in the shrine, and locked themselves in, <br />whereupon Haider Ali decided to destroy the temple altogether. <br />However, his Brahmin officers intervened and averted the disaster.</p>
<p>1790 C.E.- The threat from Tippu Sultan:</p>
<p>Tippu, the son of Haider Ali, invaded the Carnatic in 1790 C.E. with <br />his mammoth army, causing considerable havoc and destruction. He <br />stationed his army in the temple for 6 days, and demanded 100000 <br />gold pieces for his army from the temple authorities. The demand was <br />refused, at which the Sultan turned wild. Fortunately however, Tippu <br />had to flee for his own safety before he could wreak his vengeance <br />upon the temple.</p>
<p>____________ _________ ___</p>
<p>The instance below took place during the 'Carnatic Wars' (1743-1763) <br />fought between the British and the French for the control of South <br />India. Various Indian rulers also allied themselves along these two <br />European rivals. In their mutual warfare, the Srirangam and the <br />Jambukesvaram temples suffered a lot. Chanda Saheb allied with the <br />French. Note that Chanda Saheb was the son in law of the Nawab of <br />Arcot namely Dost Ali. He took advantage of a civil war at <br />Tiruchirapalli and imprisoned the Hindu queen Minaksi (1732-36) of <br />the town, establishing his own rule there. Stung by the indignities <br />heaped upon her by Chanda Saheb's men, the queen took poison and <br />died in 1736. During his rule (1736-1740), Chanda Saheb harassed the <br />temple authorities a lot and extracted large amounts of money from <br />them as tribute, till he was vanquished by the invading Maratha <br />forces in 1740.</p>
<p>"Writing in his diary under date 30 May 1752, Ananda Ranga Pillai, <br />the well known dubash and courtier of Dupleix ( = the French <br />Commander), states; 'Today I heard the following news. Of the troops <br />at Srirangam with Chanda Saheb, M. Law, etc., only 300 troopers have <br />received any pay for the last 6 months; the rest have no money to <br />live on and have suffered much from the enemy's (= the British) <br />blockade...They intended to have destroyed the Srirangam temple just <br />as they destroyed the Jambukesvaram temple; but the temple people <br />saved it for the present by giving them Rs. 60,000 and the grain <br />stored there." (pg. 212)</p>
<p>When the British finally overcame the French, they invaded the <br />Srirangam temple as well, but the 1000 Hindu Rajputs who worked for <br />Chanda Saheb refused to allow the British to invade the temple and <br />ruin its sanctity. Impressed by the bravery of the Rajputs, the <br />British abandoned their attack on the Srirangam temple.</p>

<p>  Yes, DK did some good with the whole Rational movement.. but their <br />Brahmin -<br />  bashing has<br />  become quite irrational. If they are truly rational, let us see <br />them try and<br />  criticize Islam ;) and other<br />  religions along with the ills of Hinduism.<br />  Not sure how good an idea THAT would be!</p>
<p>  Cheers,</p>

        <p>No one told me. I remember reading this somewhere around 10 to 15 (?)<br />years ago. Not sure while I was in High school or college. I seldom<br />remember things (have a poor memory :) ) but these figures fascinated<br />me so much that it got registered in my mind. </p>
<p>I have heard that Einstein had dyslexia (Aamir Kahn's Tare zameen Par<br />(?) ) but no sure about Hitler. He should be surely a sort of psycho<br />to do all those things.</p>
<p>He was considered genius because he used to think of innovative ways<br />to torture and kill the Jews.</p>

<p>  Dear Satish,</p>
<p>  I was thinking aloud on this subject, since you opened saying " <br />let <br />  us not say this is not the forum to discuss ..."</p>
<p>  But to discuss, several essential facts needed ..</p>
<p>  And primarily religeous and Cultural outfits should have opened <br />  their views... surprisingly very less..</p>
<p>  Let me put one question straight ::</p>
<p>  WHOM DO YOU THINK IS THE ACKNOWLEDGED TAMIL SCHOLAR IN TODAY'S <br />  TAMIL <br />  WORLD ..OTHER THAN DOCTOR KALAIGNAR ?</p>
<p>  Atleast put 5 names for comparison ..</p>
<p>  Mu Va<br />  Thae Po Mee<br />  Bharathi Dasan<br />  Parithimal Kalaignar<br />  Ma Po Sivagnam  <br />  Kripananda Variyar ..... all gone</p>
<p>  My Tamil Professor Dr.SATHIYA SEELAN (tamil) is a Living Legend ..</p>
<p>  Kavipperasu is my very good friend... </p>
<p>  There are Scholarly Professors very good at Tamil language ..</p>
<p>  But with due regards to most of them, are they acceptable to the <br />  Mass ?</p>
<p>  I prefer to keep POLITY out of this .. since no Political gain <br />  is apparently by this.</p>
<p>  I am yet to get convinced What Prabava - Vibhava ---- Sarvajithu - <br />  Sarvadhari (tamil years) have to do with Tamil !</p>
<p>  regards/ sps</p>
<p>  =========================<br />  Hi Malathi,</p>
<p>  The points are covered .. </p>
<p>  Satish came out with another fresh round ..and exclaimed HE was not <br />  aware of certain things ...</p>
<p>  There were two responses :</p>
<p>  1. Dear Member Kumaraguruparan replied whether Innocence / <br />Pretence ?</p>
<p>  2. Respected Member Muthukumar ( pls go through Archives .. so his <br />  postings on Far-East culture etc., etc., studded with <br />informations ) <br />  gave an account of Events .. covering a span of about 150 years..</p>
<p>  Now PLS READ THE SUBJECT AGAIN..</p>
<p>  INIYA PUTHANDU VAAZHTHUKKAL ..</p>
<p>  Is the mail flow in that Direction really ???</p>
<p>  Mr. Muthukumar cautiously chose the words.. That is why I did not <br />go <br />  into content of his mail, but in a way supplimented ...</p>
<p>  -----------------------------</p>
<p>  I am stopping here, and again am very disappointed<br />  that a balance is not brought to this debate before<br />  conclusion. It makes me very hesitant to share views<br />  on similar subjects any more.<br />  ==============================</p>
<p>  I am sure you have acknowledged the sensitivity of the subject <br />  already ..</p>
<p>  There are ample fresh things to discuss, share and cherish..</p>
<p>  Let us look forward ..</p>
<p>  NOW IN GENERAL I AM ALSO DISAPPOINTED THAT :</p>
<p>  Indira Vizha - Chithra Pournami + Rohini combination ... the <br />  romantic idea of the Tamils more than 2000 years, posted in my <br />  earlier mail ... has gone un-noticed .... !</p>
<p>  regards / sps</p>
<p>  If they read the books to<br />    understand, why is it that they found nothing<br />    positive, or could not tell public what was true about<br />    Ramayana and what was not? I have known westerners,<br />    completely alein to hinduism, who read Ramayana and<br />    were very impressed by qualities they found. They did<br />    find issues too but not like the mindset the DKites<br />    had.</p>
<p>    I realize you want to close the thread, as this is not<br />    going to lead anywhere anyway. That is ok. I am just<br />    disappointed that you chose to see one member's stance<br />    only and conclude based on that.</p>
<p>    Noone is disputing the need for anti religious, anti<br />    caste struggle that started with EVR's leadership. But<br />    to continue the line of hate propoganda and label all<br />    believers as 'kattu mirandis' and 'mutttaals' is<br />    outdated and uncivilised. To do away with 'give and<br />    take respect' is even more uncivilised. I have<br />    attended meetings of Atheist associations in america<br />    also. Athiesm by itself one is not a beleif system -<br />    most athiests believe either in science, aliens,<br />    something alternate, just calling 'kadavul illai' is<br />    not what one believes in. Second in western countries<br />    you can get sued for verbal abuse if you call the<br />    other person 'muttal' and 'kattumirandi'. If you think<br />    they abuse you with their beliefs substantiate that<br />    and attack the abuse, not the belief system.</p>

<p>        SPS I would correct what you said a little, one<br />      should<br />        read and understand more not just on Periyar, Anna<br />      and<br />        Kalignar, but on *anyone* we choose to comment or<br />        develop strong feelings around. That applies to<br />        dravidians as much as to 'others' (if that is a<br />        classification we want to keep).<br />      ====================================</p>
<p>      Hi,</p>
<p>      Member Kumaraguruparan elaborated this nicely.</p>
<p>      Before such personalities CRITICISED certain <br />      Beliefs / mentions/ <br />      customs, they FULLY read, understood and then<br />      putforward their <br />      views .. say 80 to 50 years back ... !</p>
<p>      And imagine the society prevailed at that point of<br />      time.</p>
<p>      Dear Satish,</p>
<p>      Glad to know that you are not able to understand<br />      certain things in <br />      Maraimalai Adigalar book. Means it has served the<br />      purpose.</p>

        <p>Hi<br />i for one have come from one of the most casteist areas of tamil nadu.<br />a neighbouring village kandadevi is in the news every year for the <br />high tensions prevailing during the ther function. the government has <br />cancelled the ther rather than shed blood sometimes.</p>
<p>the swarna murthy temple is owned by the sivaganga queen, was rebuilt <br />and embellished with sculpture by the nagarathars.<br />but the fight is between the thevar cast and the dalits.</p>
<p>where did the bramhin come into this?<br />the poor gurukal is the only bramhin in the picture.</p>
<p>this example i am quoting to 'absolve" the bramhin community of <br />creating caste divides in a major part of tamilnadu.<br />the dominant caste in 90% or even more in 1900 -1945 was not the <br />bramhin if you take village wise.<br />the chettiars dominated in chetinad, the moopanars and the vandayars <br />in most of tanjore, the naickers in covai, the reddiars in mid <br />tamilnadu the vaniyars in a bulk of the north, the thevars in the <br />south etc....<br />they controlled the village temple, they ran the local school and <br />generally decided who had to do what. if you observe without bias <br />these caste configurations still prevail in these areas.<br />the aim of the 'justice party' was to target braminism not in village <br />level but in the coridoors of power in madras.<br />a huge bramhin migration to the city , their aptitude for learning <br />caused a huge power shift in favour of them in british india. the <br />justice party caused a bogey man. a fear psychosis.<br />this hurt the bramhins but inadverantly propelled them towards <br />greener pastures.</p>
<p>like everybody before i need to put in a disclaimer. my family was <br />closely involved in the justice party in the early years.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Sathish</p>
<p>  Having some familiarity with the tamil movement in the last 150 <br />  years and read through a few of the books, here are my comments.</p>
<p>  1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south Tamilnadu as a <br />  antidote to the active missionary activities in these areas. Refer <br />  Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a movement fostered <br />  primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with the Athinams of <br />  these areas to counter the conversion activities and promote <br />Saivism <br />  as an active alternative.<br />  2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the Saivism is based on <br />  the fact that it lead to the contact with 'low' castes and the <br />  language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the 'exclusivity' of <br />  sanskrit.<br />  3. This happens about 150 years back and if you look into the <br />  history of the ascendent 'low' castes/high castes of these times <br />  (like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc), they ended up building <br />  temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests and the pooja was <br />  done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my Kuladeivam temple is <br />  in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on my talks with the <br />  poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for atleast 3-4 <br />  generations. This is also recorded in the Hardgrave's history on <br />  Nadars and Caldwell's history on Thirunelveli (both are available <br />  and in print). This is true in any number of temples built by the <br />  low/high castes for the siru as well as perunthivangal. <br />  4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the society in terms of <br />  prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating the Brahmins who <br />  were already there as the highest caste. When that was found to not <br />  yield results, they sort of 'rebelled' and asserted themselves by <br />  building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />  5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most of you here for <br />  the kind of reaction espoused by DK (the Justice party before that) <br />  is actually surprising. To understand the kind of oppression that <br />  went through in the rural areas of southern TN in the late last <br />  century, you need to read the histories mentioned above along with <br />  the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references to it in <br />  U.Ve.Sa's 'En sarithiram', the journals of the Saveriraya pillai <br />  (who converted to Christianity) etc. It is no use just expressing <br />  outrage at Periyar without understanding the context. <br />  Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of avoiding the <br />  Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the DK. If you look <br />  into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he comes from a <br />very <br />  religious background with a lot of compassion for the downtrodden. <br />  Only when he realized that it is not possible to change the system <br />  from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to break up the <br />entire <br />  system and built it anew. There his opposition for Ramayan and <br />other <br />  established scriptures which need to be tossed aside and a new <br />  society to be built. We know what happened to that now.</p>
<p>  The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a Tamil, for better or <br />  worse and it is not a 'religious fundamentalist' movement but a <br />  nationalist movement trying to free the masses from years of <br />  oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the people together <br />  and build a new society. How much good/bad came out of it is <br />  debatable. </p>

<p>  PS - As an aside my father spent a day in the police station during <br />  the 1964 agitations for taking part in a anti-hindi rally in <br />  Madurai. My grandfather took him out but strictly forbidden him to <br />  do any such things again. There ended my family's association with <br />  this movement. </p>

<p>    Since I could not lay my hands on any of the information <br />  pertaining to<br />    the basis of Jan 14 being tamil new year (again i should admit I <br />  might<br />    not be doing a good search), I started searching for Maraimalai<br />    adigal, since he was one of the key person in the 1921 convention.</p>
<p>    Not much I could get, but came across an interesting book by <br />  Sumathi<br />    ramaswamy, titled 'Passion of the Tongue - Language Devotion in <br />  Tamil<br />    India, 1891?1970' published in the year 1997. This book is <br />  available<br />    in the link below -</p>
<p>    <a href="http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol" title="http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol">http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol</a></p>
<p>    I didnt go through the entire book, but a quick scan on a few <br />  pages, i<br />    got something. I should admit, my understanding could be totally <br />  wrong<br />    or I would have missed the context. Scholars in this group can <br />  correct me.</p>
<p>    - The need for Tamil Passion came as an offshoot of religious<br />    fundamentalism. If I understand right, anti-brahminism<br />    - Indian National Congress was full of active brahmins and the<br />    non-brahmin community feared this prosperity of brahmins.<br />    - To alienate the brahmins or the aryan influence, a need was <br />felt <br />  to<br />    come out with a Tamil based culture - glorifying Tamil, calling <br />  tamil<br />    as 'Taniththamizh' (without mix of Sanskrit), 'theivath thamizh'<br />    taking the language to godliness.<br />    - This continued to the movement to clear tamil of other langauge <br />  mix,<br />    like english, sanskrit and persian (?) and make the tamil language<br />    pure. Thats when pure tamil movement was started<br />    - Many stalwarts including Maraimalai adigal were part of this<br />    movement. they were not atheist but said that siva is a tamil god <br />  and<br />    not a aryan god. This gave raise to the Saiva sidhantham. later<br />    Periya, Anna et al are said to have adopted this thani tamil<br />    ideology.This gave raise to the draidian movement. (but I am not <br />  sure<br />    how the atheism came in)</p>
<p>    Good to know that Maraimalai adigal has published nearly 54 books,<br />    both in english and tamil.</p>
<p>    Someon said that only mylapore ,mambalam people accepted aryan <br />  theory<br />    and this book says that the non-brahmins of tamil nadu wanted to<br />    alienate brahmins who are aryans. I am totally confused :( manda<br />    kayuthu...</p>
<p>    The best part is - The tamil purist said tamil has a religion of <br />  their<br />    own and a person is considered a 'Tamilan' only if his uyir porul <br />  aavi<br />    is tamil. They also add that people who came from outside with <br />  tamil<br />    not as their mother tongue, and still love tamil, they are also<br />    tamilan. Whoever wishes to learn and love tamil is also 'tamilan'.</p>
<p>    BUT....tamil brahmins are not tamilan!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Let me put one question straight ::</p>
<p>WHOM DO YOU THINK IS THE ACKNOWLEDGED TAMIL SCHOLAR IN TODAY'S <br />TAMIL <br />WORLD ..OTHER THAN DOCTOR KALAIGNAR ?</p>
<p>Atleast put 5 names for comparison ..</p>
<p>Mu Va<br />Thae Po Mee<br />Bharathi Dasan<br />Parithimal Kalaignar<br />Ma Po Sivagnam  <br />Kripananda Variyar ..... all gone</p>
<p>My Tamil Professor Dr.SATHIYA SEELAN (tamil) is a Living Legend ..</p>
<p>Kavipperasu is my very good friend... </p>
<p>There are Scholarly Professors very good at Tamil language ..</p>
<p>But with due regards to most of them, are they acceptable to the <br />Mass ?</p>
<p>I prefer to keep POLITY out of this .. since no Political gain <br />is apparently by this.</p>
<p>I am yet to get convinced What Prabava - Vibhava ---- Sarvajithu - <br />Sarvadhari (tamil years) have to do with Tamil !</p>
<p>regards/ sps</p>
<p>=========================<br />Hi Malathi,</p>
<p>The points are covered .. </p>
<p>Satish came out with another fresh round ..and exclaimed HE was not <br />aware of certain things ...</p>
<p>There were two responses :</p>
<p>1. Dear Member Kumaraguruparan replied whether Innocence / Pretence ?</p>
<p>2. Respected Member Muthukumar ( pls go through Archives .. so his <br />postings on Far-East culture etc., etc., studded with informations ) <br />gave an account of Events .. covering a span of about 150 years..</p>
<p>Now PLS READ THE SUBJECT AGAIN..</p>
<p>INIYA PUTHANDU VAAZHTHUKKAL ..</p>
<p>Is the mail flow in that Direction really ???</p>
<p>Mr. Muthukumar cautiously chose the words.. That is why I did not go <br />into content of his mail, but in a way supplimented ...</p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>I am stopping here, and again am very disappointed<br />that a balance is not brought to this debate before<br />conclusion. It makes me very hesitant to share views<br />on similar subjects any more.<br />==============================</p>
<p>I am sure you have acknowledged the sensitivity of the subject <br />already ..</p>
<p>There are ample fresh things to discuss, share and cherish..</p>
<p>Let us look forward ..</p>
<p>NOW IN GENERAL I AM ALSO DISAPPOINTED THAT :</p>
<p>Indira Vizha - Chithra Pournami + Rohini combination ... the <br />romantic idea of the Tamils more than 2000 years, posted in my <br />earlier mail ... has gone un-noticed .... !</p>
<p>regards / sps</p>
<p>If they read the books to</p>
<blockquote><p>  understand, why is it that they found nothing<br />  positive, or could not tell public what was true about<br />  Ramayana and what was not? I have known westerners,<br />  completely alein to hinduism, who read Ramayana and<br />  were very impressed by qualities they found. They did<br />  find issues too but not like the mindset the DKites<br />  had.</p>
<p>  I realize you want to close the thread, as this is not<br />  going to lead anywhere anyway. That is ok. I am just<br />  disappointed that you chose to see one member's stance<br />  only and conclude based on that.</p>
<p>  Noone is disputing the need for anti religious, anti<br />  caste struggle that started with EVR's leadership. But<br />  to continue the line of hate propoganda and label all<br />  believers as 'kattu mirandis' and 'mutttaals' is<br />  outdated and uncivilised. To do away with 'give and<br />  take respect' is even more uncivilised. I have<br />  attended meetings of Atheist associations in america<br />  also. Athiesm by itself one is not a beleif system -<br />  most athiests believe either in science, aliens,<br />  something alternate, just calling 'kadavul illai' is<br />  not what one believes in. Second in western countries<br />  you can get sued for verbal abuse if you call the<br />  other person 'muttal' and 'kattumirandi'. If you think<br />  they abuse you with their beliefs substantiate that<br />  and attack the abuse, not the belief system.</p>

<p>    Hi,</p>

<p>    Before such personalities CRITICISED certain <br />    Beliefs / mentions/ <br />    customs, they FULLY read, understood and then<br />    putforward their <br />    views .. say 80 to 50 years back ... !</p>
<p>    And imagine the society prevailed at that point of<br />    time.</p>
<p>    Dear Satish,</p>
<p>    Glad to know that you are not able to understand<br />    certain things in <br />    Maraimalai Adigalar book. Means it has served the<br />    purpose.</p>
<p>    Shall we say we close this subject.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi</p>
<p>My quote was not saying you disputed the fact of beliefs. My point <br />is, the non believers are essential catalysts to spiral the believer <br />clause.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Ravi wrote: <br />    Malathi , there is always going to be believers and <br />non believers. <br />    My .02 cents... <br />the <br />    very purpose of Budhisum and Samana religions to have marched <br />across <br />    the land was to revive hinduism. <br />    Gyana sambandar was the best example "padi vEdham padiyAp <br />pAthakar <br />    pAy andriyudAp pEdhaigaL kEsam paRi kOppALigaL yaarum kazhuvERa" <br />    According to Arunagiri, the people who refused to acknowledge the <br />    veda were led to destruction following the avatar of Sambandar. <br />    Now going back to the times in the 80 - 90's and today, has not <br />the <br />    belief in religion gone up ? As sins mount, man looks for the <br />    ultimate to help him. There are people who do believe blindly, <br />never <br />    the more - they have began to believe. <br />    As the crowd for DK begins to thin the crowd at temples begin to <br />    bulge. <br />    These activists are only a part of the grander scheme of the Lord <br />to <br />    enable the path of Dharma. Like some one quoted...irulai irul <br />aaki <br />    velicham tharuvan. <br />    If DK was not there, the rampant practices of casteisum would <br />have <br />    deteriorated the country, the very fact that DK quashed that is a <br />    start of what was to happen in the future. Well if we had all <br />walked <br />    on the path of Lord Ram, DK would have never been born. However <br />that <br />    birth led to a movement that is on the process to be quelled now. <br />    Nature - will recyle itself. The truth of Vedas is eternal and no <br />    force in the cosmos can supress that for a long time. <br />    -- R <br />    --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com , Malathi Mahadevan <br /><dmaloo@  <br />    wrote: </dmaloo@></p>

        <p>AK, I agree sometimes tone is important. Answer this<br />question for me, if you claim DKites read Ramayana why<br />is it that none of them were able to find anything<br />positive in the story/epic? For centuries even people<br />totally alien to Hinduism have been able to relate to<br />the Ramayana and understand its essence and message.</p>
<p>I will tell you why - they read it with purpose of<br />attacking the Brahmin community which often used the<br />epic for developing a poor belief system and keeping<br />others suppressed. It was not an unbiased reading.<br />That might have been valid at some point of time, but<br />we have outgrown that situation now. </p>
<p>We have outgrown the situation they were dealing with<br />in many ways now. People in any generation always need<br />a belief system. Athiesm or negating and attacking<br />someone else is not a belief system. Rationatiy by<br />itself is not enough for human beings to deal with<br />life, life has many irrational and completely tough,<br />hard situations that force a human to believe in<br />things beyond. Gandhi said once that his faith in God<br />is not a choice, it is a necessity.</p>
<p>Noone negated what these people did for tamils. But to<br />understand what they did not do correctly is also<br />equally important and correct as we grow.</p>

<p>  This was already answered in messages 22089 and<br />  22095. Not sure if <br />  you are not convinced or have not read.</p>
<p>  misunderstood<br />    something, no one tries to clarify and make me<br />  understand, but <br />  downpour<br />    with trashings pulling out unwanted things. </p>
<p>  It may be because of not able to identify the tone.<br />  There is a <br />  difference between asking a doubt without knowing<br />  the answer and <br />  asking sarcastically with known answer. The level of<br />  submissiveness <br />  differs. But, unfortunately, the latter uses the<br />  same tone of the <br />  formar by wearing the mask of innocent. Answering<br />  the latter's <br />  question in the same way it is answered to the<br />  formar will make the <br />  replier fool.

        <p>SPs, I am sorry to disagree. Reading with purpose of<br />understanding and reading with purpose of trashing are<br />completely different. If they read the books to<br />understand, why is it that they found nothing<br />positive, or could not tell public what was true about<br />Ramayana and what was not? I have known westerners,<br />completely alein to hinduism, who read Ramayana and<br />were very impressed by qualities they found. They did<br />find issues too but not like the mindset the DKites<br />had.</p>
<p>I realize you want to close the thread, as this is not<br />going to lead anywhere anyway. That is ok. I am just<br />disappointed that you chose to see one member's stance<br />only and conclude based on that.</p>
<p>Noone is disputing the need for anti religious, anti<br />caste struggle that started with EVR's leadership. But<br />to continue the line of hate propoganda and label all<br />believers as 'kattu mirandis' and 'mutttaals' is<br />outdated and uncivilised. To do away with 'give and<br />take respect' is even more uncivilised. I have<br />attended meetings of Atheist associations in america<br />also. Athiesm by itself one is not a beleif system -<br />most athiests believe either in science, aliens,<br />something alternate, just calling 'kadavul illai' is<br />not what one believes in. Second in western countries<br />you can get sued for verbal abuse if you call the<br />other person 'muttal' and 'kattumirandi'. If you think<br />they abuse you with their beliefs substantiate that<br />and attack the abuse, not the belief system.</p>
<p>I am stopping here, and again am very disappointed<br />that a balance is not brought to this debate before<br />conclusion. It makes me very hesitant to share views<br />on similar subjects any more.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Now let us slightly go back to POST GAZNI - or Malik Gafur in <br />  Southern India (say 1350 AD) Just prior to Vijayanagara (in about <br />  1500 AD)!</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear sps</p>
<p>Just today i was seeing this reference...talk of <br />coincidences.....also venkat your madurai - when is it going to come <br />out in tamil...</p>
<p>1311C.E.- Attacks by Malik Kafur, the general of Allauddin Khilji: </p>
<p>According the traditional accounts, the Muslim army lead by Malik <br />Kafur entered the Srirangam temple throught the northern gateway of <br />the 3rd enclosure. The resistance of the Brahmins was overcome <br />easily, the treasury and the storehouse were plundered and numerous <br />icons were desecrated and destroyed. Malik Kafur?s foray however did <br />not last long and soon, he retreated to the north with all the <br />treasure he had looted from the temples of South India. The temple <br />rituals resumed as before after the Muslim army retreated.</p>
<p>1323 C.E.- Ulugh Khan?s expedition and the sack of Srirangam temple: </p>
<p>Ghiyas-ud-din Tuglaq, the Sultan of Delhi, deputed his eldest son <br />Ulugh Khan to invade the Hindu kingdoms of South India in 1321 C.E. <br />When the Muslim army of Ulugh Khan was close to the Srirangam <br />temple, a festival was being conducted, in the course of which the <br />procession image of Lord Ranganath was taken to a nearby shrine. The <br />gathered devotees decided to keep the image where it was and the <br />festival was continued. When the invaders reached Samayapuram, <br />Srirangarajanathan Vaduldesika, a senior official of the temple, <br />decided that no time was to be lost, and commanding the 12000 <br />ascetics who had gathered there not to disperse, he sent away the <br />procession image of the deity in the southern direction secretly, <br />with Pillai Lokacarya as the guide of the secret party. Then, he <br />dispatched secretly the image of Sriranga Nacciyar and a few boxes <br />of treasure with a few attendants to a safe place, locked the doors <br />of the sanctum sanctorum, barred the doorways of the shrines of both <br />Lord Ranganayaka and Devi Ranganayika, placed pseudo images outside <br />and then fled to the shrine of Panvijavian. The invading army <br />desecrated the shrine, killed all the 12000 ascetics, including the <br />great scholar Sri Sundarsana Bhatta. Another sage, Sri Vedanta <br />Desika, hid himself amongst the corpses together with the sole <br />manuscript of the Srutaprakasika, the magnum opus of Sri Sudarsana, <br />and also the latter?s two sons. When the massacre was over, they <br />fled to Satyamangalam in Mysore, where Sri Vedanta Desika published <br />the Srutaprakasika. It is said that the image was finally housed in <br />the protected sanctuary of Tirupati, unfortunately after Pillai <br />Lokacarya died of shock when he heard of the slaughter of his kith <br />and kin at Srirangam.</p>
<p>The Muslim army occupied the temple precincts and put and an end to <br />Hindu worship. A temple courtesan, who fascinated the invading <br />general, prevailed upon him not to destroy the temple altogether, <br />and restrict his vandalism to the destruction of a few cornices. The <br />Brahmins in the surrounding areas tried to perform the sacred <br />rituals whenever they could, but were harassed by the occupying <br />Muslim forces constantly. The general was constantly attacked by <br />disease as long as he remained in the temple, and so he moved to the <br />nearby Poysalesvara temple, which he destroyed and erected a <br />fortress at its place. </p>
<p>The tale of sack of Srirangam cannot be complete without the mention <br />of the sacrifice of the temple courtesan. Unable to bear the <br />harassment of the devotees by the Muslims, she enticed the Muslim <br />chief, took him up a temple tower in the east, and in the pretext of <br />showing him a famous icon from there, she pushed him down and killed <br />him. Scared that she will be tortured by the Muslims as a result of <br />her deed, she threw herself also down. According to tradition, to <br />honor her memory, the funeral pyres of temple courtesans are lit by <br />fire brought from the temple kitchen.</p>
<p>In 1371 C.E., the newly founded Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar wrested <br />back Srirangam from Muslim control, and re-installed the icon hidden <br />at Tirupati with full ceremonies and processions.</p>
<p>1752-1758 C.E.- Depredations by the French:</p>
<p>During these 6 years, the temple was under the occupation of the <br />French, who ruled from Pondicherry. They plundered the temple, and <br />were planning on harassing the entire population that had taken <br />refuge in the shrine, when an old Frenchman pleaded for mercy on <br />behalf of the local inhabitants. Numerous accounts exist of the <br />harassment of the inhabitants of the nearby areas by the occupying <br />troops, including the molestation of women. The inner precincts of <br />the temple were saved from desecration by 1000 Rajput soldiers of <br />the army of Chanda Saheb. </p>
<p>1781 C.E.- The threat of another sack by Haider Ali:</p>
<p>Haider Ali was the Muslim ruler of Mysore, who invaded Srirangam in <br />1781, devastating territories en route. The inhabitants of the <br />region sought refuge in the shrine, and locked themselves in, <br />whereupon Haider Ali decided to destroy the temple altogether. <br />However, his Brahmin officers intervened and averted the disaster.</p>
<p>1790 C.E.- The threat from Tippu Sultan:</p>
<p>Tippu, the son of Haider Ali, invaded the Carnatic in 1790 C.E. with <br />his mammoth army, causing considerable havoc and destruction. He <br />stationed his army in the temple for 6 days, and demanded 100000 <br />gold pieces for his army from the temple authorities. The demand was <br />refused, at which the Sultan turned wild. Fortunately however, Tippu <br />had to flee for his own safety before he could wreak his vengeance <br />upon the temple.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>The instance below took place during the 'Carnatic Wars' (1743-1763) <br />fought between the British and the French for the control of South <br />India. Various Indian rulers also allied themselves along these two <br />European rivals. In their mutual warfare, the Srirangam and the <br />Jambukesvaram temples suffered a lot. Chanda Saheb allied with the <br />French. Note that Chanda Saheb was the son in law of the Nawab of <br />Arcot namely Dost Ali. He took advantage of a civil war at <br />Tiruchirapalli and imprisoned the Hindu queen Minaksi (1732-36) of <br />the town, establishing his own rule there. Stung by the indignities <br />heaped upon her by Chanda Saheb's men, the queen took poison and <br />died in 1736. During his rule (1736-1740), Chanda Saheb harassed the <br />temple authorities a lot and extracted large amounts of money from <br />them as tribute, till he was vanquished by the invading Maratha <br />forces in 1740.</p>
<p>"Writing in his diary under date 30 May 1752, Ananda Ranga Pillai, <br />the well known dubash and courtier of Dupleix ( = the French <br />Commander), states; 'Today I heard the following news. Of the troops <br />at Srirangam with Chanda Saheb, M. Law, etc., only 300 troopers have <br />received any pay for the last 6 months; the rest have no money to <br />live on and have suffered much from the enemy's (= the British) <br />blockade...They intended to have destroyed the Srirangam temple just <br />as they destroyed the Jambukesvaram temple; but the temple people <br />saved it for the present by giving them Rs. 60,000 and the grain <br />stored there." (pg. 212)</p>
<p>When the British finally overcame the French, they invaded the <br />Srirangam temple as well, but the 1000 Hindu Rajputs who worked for <br />Chanda Saheb refused to allow the British to invade the temple and <br />ruin its sanctity. Impressed by the bravery of the Rajputs, the <br />British abandoned their attack on the Srirangam temple.</p>

        <p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Muthu Prakash R" <br /><mprakas@...  wrote:</p>
<p>Sathish<br />================================================== <br />Having some familiarity with the tamil movement in the last 150 <br />years and read through a few of the books, here are my comments.</p>
<p>1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south Tamilnadu as a <br />antidote to the active missionary activities in these areas. Refer <br />Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a movement fostered <br />primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with the Athinams of <br />these areas to counter the conversion activities and promote <br />Saivism as an active alternative.</p>
<p>2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the Saivism is based on <br />the fact that it lead to the contact with 'low' castes and the <br />language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the 'exclusivity' of <br />sanskrit.</p>
<p>3. This happens about 150 years back and if you look into the <br />history of the ascendent 'low' castes/high castes of these times <br />(like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc), they ended up building <br />temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests and the pooja was <br />done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my Kuladeivam temple is <br />in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on my talks with the <br />poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for atleast 3-4 <br />generations. This is also recorded in the Hardgrave's history on <br />Nadars and Caldwell's history on Thirunelveli (both are available <br />and in print). This is true in any number of temples built by the <br />low/high castes for the siru as well as perunthivangal. </p>
<p>4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the society in terms of <br />prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating the Brahmins who <br />were already there as the highest caste. When that was found to not <br />yield results, they sort of 'rebelled' and asserted themselves by <br />building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.</p>
<p>5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most of you here for <br />the kind of reaction espoused by DK (the Justice party before that) <br />is actually surprising. To understand the kind of oppression that <br />went through in the rural areas of southern TN in the late last <br />century, you need to read the histories mentioned above along with <br />the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references to it in <br />U.Ve.Sa's 'En sarithiram', the journals of the Saveriraya pillai <br />(who converted to Christianity) etc. It is no use just expressing <br />outrage at Periyar without understanding the context. <br />Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of avoiding the <br />Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the DK. If you look <br />into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he comes from a <br />very religious background with a lot of compassion for the <br />downtrodden.</p>
<p>Only when he realized that it is not possible to change the system <br />from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to break up the <br />entire system and built it anew. There his opposition for Ramayan <br />and other established scriptures which need to be tossed aside and <br />a new society to be built. We know what happened to that now.</p>
<p>The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a Tamil, for better or <br />worse and it is not a 'religious fundamentalist' movement but a <br />nationalist movement trying to free the masses from years of <br />oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the people together <br />and build a new society. How much good/bad came out of it is <br />debatable. </p>
<p>Muthu Prakash R<br /><a href="http://sibipranav.blogpost.com" title="http://sibipranav.blogpost.com">http://sibipranav.blogpost.com</a><br />============================================ </p>
<p>DEAR MUTHUPRAKASH,</p>
<p>Very good summation. Precise. </p>
<p>A couple of observations ::</p>
<p>The point of reference is about 150 years back. <br />Means let us say by about 1850 AD... <br />Also let us say at formation of Indian National Congress...</p>
<p>Therefore the above summation need to be run into our minds taking <br />into consideration the FREEDOM MOVEMENT as well ..</p>
<p>In front of the Freedom Fighters, there were TWO MAIN ISSUES :</p>
<p>1. CHASING AWAY THE BRITISH out of India.<br />2. Setting right the Deep rooted Superstitious customs amidst native <br />Hindus. (Balya Vivaham - Vidhava Vivaham - untouchability etc etc).</p>
<p>And The British too were against Balya Vivaham - Vidhava Vivaham.. <br />Re Untouchability - they played COLOR Cord effectively..</p>
<p>Now let us slightly go back to POST GAZNI - or Malik Gafur in <br />Southern India (say 1350 AD) Just prior to Vijayanagara (in about <br />1500 AD)!</p>
<p>Convert to Islam or face Death- to men,<br />Molastation of Women (infront of their family)</p>
<p>This problem was on the higher Degree for Brahmin community - <br />particularly Brahmin women. Thousands of men died.</p>
<p>Owners - who enjoyed prefernces from previous Chozha - Pandya rulers <br />paid dealy for all their Aristocracy.</p>
<p>Madhan's Vandhargal Vendrargal does talk some of these in detail.</p>
<p>With Harihara - Bukkar Brahmins, on the banks of Thungabadra River - <br />with Krishna Deva Rayar uprising against the Moghals, the Mohammedan <br />Rule was nearing an end in the Southern India.. </p>
<p>But with infight among various Palaykkarars - in TN - The East India <br />Trading Company (Like PEPSI &amp; COKE of today )could Rule the  <br />Tamilnadu - with an Iron hand.</p>
<p>There was uprise against the British from all the sections of the <br />communities in Tamilnadu..</p>
<p>But the elite among the upper Castes maintained friendly ties with <br />the British .. (though we blame the British for dividing and <br />ruling .. ! ) and got SIR title and what not .. !</p>

        <p>Dear Eswaran.</p>
<p>How can a Tamil Year be named after Sanskrit ?</p>
<p>The period appears to be post Vijayanagara - Nayaks..</p>
<p>That is the point for reference ..</p>
<p>But in all the mails related to this, one significant point is not <br />touched.</p>
<p>Tamil Years .. commencing on Chithirai 1 - with Prabava to.. 60 <br />years is a cycle.. and again on the 61st year it is PRABAVA...</p>
<p>by following this system, We can never denote the (atleast 3rd BC to <br />13th AD) - Ancient Tamil History...  </p>
<p>Hence it did not exist during this period either..</p>
<p>Valluvarandu is there for the Government to consider against <br />Prabava .. Vibhava... 60 year cycle..</p>
<p>Fasli (Revenue Year) ... is interesting diction ..</p>
<p>Hope Venkat enlightens ..</p>

<p>    regards/ sps<br />    ------------ --------</p>
<p>  Just because they are in sanskrit, can we ignore it.</p>
<p>  Many present popular names of Tamilnadu are sanskrit.</p>
<p>  1) Karunanithi,udhaya suriyan,Ramadas are sanskrit<br />  names</p>
<p>  2) karthar,kirubai (Tamil christians' usage words) are<br />  sanskrit. Are they not tamilians?</p>
<p>  3) Tamil muslims follow arabic calendar. Their names<br />  are mostly from Arabic or persian. Are they not<br />  tamils?</p>
<p>  Politicians make big hue and cry only incase of Hindus<br />  to follow pure tamil names , tamil archanai at temples<br />  and tamil marriages etc.</p>
<p>  But they dare to call it for other religious groups<br />  for obvious reasons</p>

        <p>Sathish</p>
<p>Having some familiarity with the tamil movement in the last 150 <br />years and read through a few of the books, here are my comments.</p>
<p>1. Shaivism came into being primarily in the south Tamilnadu as a <br />antidote to the active missionary activities in these areas. Refer <br />Arumuga Navalar/Dandapani Pillai. This is a movement fostered <br />primarily by the Saiva Pillai community along with the Athinams of <br />these areas to counter the conversion activities and promote Saivism <br />as an active alternative.<br />2. The braminical/high caste opposition to the Saivism is based on <br />the fact that it lead to the contact with 'low' castes and the <br />language used was Tamil, thereby taking away the 'exclusivity' of <br />sanskrit.<br />3. This happens about 150 years back and if you look into the <br />history of the ascendent 'low' castes/high castes of these times <br />(like Thevars, Pillais, Nadar/Shanars etc), they ended up building <br />temples for themselves with non-Brahmin priests and the pooja was <br />done in Tamil. This, I know, even today, as my Kuladeivam temple is <br />in the Therimedu area in Tiruchendur and based on my talks with the <br />poojaris there tamil poojas are conducted for atleast 3-4 <br />generations. This is also recorded in the Hardgrave's history on <br />Nadars and Caldwell's history on Thirunelveli (both are available <br />and in print). This is true in any number of temples built by the <br />low/high castes for the siru as well as perunthivangal. <br />4. When the middle/high castes ascended in the society in terms of <br />prosperity/status, at first, they tried emulating the Brahmins who <br />were already there as the highest caste. When that was found to not <br />yield results, they sort of 'rebelled' and asserted themselves by <br />building temples and conducting poojas in Tamil.<br />5. The anti-brahminism which seem to surprise most of you here for <br />the kind of reaction espoused by DK (the Justice party before that) <br />is actually surprising. To understand the kind of oppression that <br />went through in the rural areas of southern TN in the late last <br />century, you need to read the histories mentioned above along with <br />the writings of Ayothidasar. There are references to it in <br />U.Ve.Sa's 'En sarithiram', the journals of the Saveriraya pillai <br />(who converted to Christianity) etc. It is no use just expressing <br />outrage at Periyar without understanding the context. <br />Justice party was founded with the avowed aim of avoiding the <br />Brahmin-dominated Congress. This later became the DK. If you look <br />into the life of Periyar, you will realize that he comes from a very <br />religious background with a lot of compassion for the downtrodden. <br />Only when he realized that it is not possible to change the system <br />from within, he ended up an atheist and urged to break up the entire <br />system and built it anew. There his opposition for Ramayan and other <br />established scriptures which need to be tossed aside and a new <br />society to be built. We know what happened to that now.</p>
<p>The Tamil movement defined what it is to be a Tamil, for better or <br />worse and it is not a 'religious fundamentalist' movement but a <br />nationalist movement trying to free the masses from years of <br />oppression. Tamil was used as a tool to bring the people together <br />and build a new society. How much good/bad came out of it is <br />debatable. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Since I could not lay my hands on any of the information <br />pertaining to<br />  the basis of Jan 14 being tamil new year (again i should admit I <br />might<br />  not be doing a good search), I started searching for Maraimalai<br />  adigal, since he was one of the key person in the 1921 convention.</p>
<p>  Not much I could get, but came across an interesting book by <br />Sumathi<br />  ramaswamy, titled 'Passion of the Tongue - Language Devotion in <br />Tamil<br />  India, 1891?1970' published in the year 1997. This book is <br />available<br />  in the link below -</p>
<p>  <a href="http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol" title="http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol">http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol</a></p>
<p>  I didnt go through the entire book, but a quick scan on a few <br />pages, i<br />  got something. I should admit, my understanding could be totally <br />wrong<br />  or I would have missed the context. Scholars in this group can <br />correct me.</p>
<p>  - The need for Tamil Passion came as an offshoot of religious<br />  fundamentalism. If I understand right, anti-brahminism<br />  - Indian National Congress was full of active brahmins and the<br />  non-brahmin community feared this prosperity of brahmins.<br />  - To alienate the brahmins or the aryan influence, a need was felt <br />to<br />  come out with a Tamil based culture - glorifying Tamil, calling <br />tamil<br />  as 'Taniththamizh' (without mix of Sanskrit), 'theivath thamizh'<br />  taking the language to godliness.<br />  - This continued to the movement to clear tamil of other langauge <br />mix,<br />  like english, sanskrit and persian (?) and make the tamil language<br />  pure. Thats when pure tamil movement was started<br />  - Many stalwarts including Maraimalai adigal were part of this<br />  movement. they were not atheist but said that siva is a tamil god <br />and<br />  not a aryan god. This gave raise to the Saiva sidhantham. later<br />  Periya, Anna et al are said to have adopted this thani tamil<br />  ideology.This gave raise to the draidian movement. (but I am not <br />sure<br />  how the atheism came in)</p>
<p>  Good to know that Maraimalai adigal has published nearly 54 books,<br />  both in english and tamil.</p>
<p>  Someon said that only mylapore ,mambalam people accepted aryan <br />theory<br />  and this book says that the non-brahmins of tamil nadu wanted to<br />  alienate brahmins who are aryans. I am totally confused :( manda<br />  kayuthu...</p>
<p>  The best part is - The tamil purist said tamil has a religion of <br />their<br />  own and a person is considered a 'Tamilan' only if his uyir porul <br />aavi<br />  is tamil. They also add that people who came from outside with <br />tamil<br />  not as their mother tongue, and still love tamil, they are also<br />  tamilan. Whoever wishes to learn and love tamil is also 'tamilan'.</p>
<p>  BUT....tamil brahmins are not tamilan!!!!!!!!</p>
