<p>It is also true that we can reject a hypothesis in history if there is<br />zero percentage of truth with full falsity.</p>
<p>As SB Sir and Sankaran have pointed out, not all of Rajaraja Chola's<br />employees were from the same caste/family. So the hypothesis of BV<br />that ALL of his employees shall be rejected. Oh well, most of his<br />employees is different from ALL of his employees, because there can be<br />either THIS or THAT. Therefore the hypothesis/observation that<br />Rajaraja is Egoist (because he wanted to control a particular caste as<br />his servants) is also not true.</p>

<p>    Aside from that, from what you have said NHST is to find out what <br />  is wrong and what is right, right? I take it NHST concludes <br />  hypothesis in history would turn the path of a researcher to find <br />  proof for his theory whereas it would be more apt to conclude <br />  issues based on facts and correlation.</p>
<p>  ---------- No.NHST says "Given the null hypothesis is true what is <br />  the probablity that the data we have in our hand is a wrong <br />  data?"If the probablity is less than 0.05 we reject the null <br />  hypothesis.That indicates that the research has succeeded.</p>
<p>  It doesnt say anything about truth or falsity of the <br />  hypothesis.Actually in science no hypothesis can ever be proved to <br />  be true or untrue.Many researchers misunderstand NHST and P&lt;0.05 to <br />  indicate "What is the probablity that this hypothesis is <br />  false?".That is a popular myth in research field.</p>
<p>  I take it NHST concludes hypothesis in<br />  history would turn the path of a researcher to find proof for his<br />  theory whereas it would be more apt to conclude issues based on facts<br />  and correlation.</p>
<p>  ------- History has very little quantitative research.Research based <br />  on "facts" is not-existant.Actually thomas kuhn says that a <br />  scientist doesnt search for 'facts' in research.Maybe you are <br />  talking about theory driven research,but the concept of fact and <br />  truth are contradictory to the ideas of science and research.Truth <br />  is not a goal of scientific enquiry according to kuhn.</p>
<p>  Correlation research too needs hypothesis testing.Actually <br />  only some fields of historical research can be quantified.Again that <br />  depends on the nature of enquiry.To research social status of chola <br />  people we need less quantitative tools.But to find out whether most <br />  of Rjaraja's employees were bhramins we need to use NHST.</p>

<p>I think the easiest way to understand temple architecture would be<br />through direct coaching. When we identify the name of a part in the<br />structure and someone corrects, we wont forget it ever. Whatever we<br />learn theoritically may dim during the course of months.</p>
<p>Though it may not be possible to for everyone to take direct coaching,<br />we can simulate it powered by a computer.</p>
<p>Please visit this site:<br /><a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/pathology/teach/va/welcome.html" title="http://www.le.ac.uk/pathology/teach/va/welcome.html">http://www.le.ac.uk/pathology/teach/va/welcome.html</a></p>
<p>It is about autopsy. When I was doing medical transcription, I had<br />difficulty understanding the inner parts and functions of the human<br />body. I had books, theories explained and what not. Nothing equals<br />practical learning. So I went to the above site and practised. The<br />program will present cases of dead persons and will ask us to<br />indentify the cause of his death. We can do a virtual postmortem and<br />find out the cause of death.</p>
<p>It is an interesting way of learning. Maybe we shall try something<br />like that for temple architecture also with a new section?</p>

<p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>There is no contradiction. It is very clear. I didn't say that period<br />cannot be distinguished by style. What I meant was, based on the style<br />of only one component we cannot decide the period. My statement is<br />"POdhikais are not the ONLY parameter for judging the period". Many<br />components of architecture got changed over a period of time. For ex,<br />growth of naga bandham, growth of poomottu in podhikai, change in<br />paali, etc. This combination matching will help us to solve the<br />ambiguity caused by using the early style in later structures (like<br />tharangkap podhikai in later chola period). The last paragraph (before<br />sevvindhiya chozhan) in that podhikai article talks about the period<br />identification.</p>
<p>Hope you are clear now.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />Kamal</p>

<p>Refer below portion of your mail. I remember that Ksethrabalar <br />temple was built during the last few years of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's reign, as the <br />inscriptions mentione both <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym 's corule. Do you mean to say <br />that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  introduced vettu podigai only during his last few years, <br />say 2-3 years? Just wanted to clarify.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>

<p> .  <br />  If RRC hadn't mentioned that he built kshethrabalar shrine, we can<br />  come to the conclusion that it was built by either Paranthaka or <br />after<br />  him. RRC introduced 'vettup pOdhikai'. Till then 'kuzhavu pOdhikai'<br />  was used. It is possible that kshethrabalar shrine was built before<br />  the vettup pOdhikai was introduced.</p>

        <p>Dear Kamal,</p>
<p>Thanks for your explanation and I agree your points. I am not as <br />knowledgeable as you people are. Just throwing my points in this <br />thread. and I clearly said, people can have opinion and it can be <br />wrong,but making mockery of that opinion is wrong. THATS THE MAIN <br />POINT I AM TRYING TO DERIVE</p>

<p>Reg. Archi. I do accept that it can be mixture of different period. <br />You only taught me that if such a style exist its of a certain <br />period and you yourself now say that period cannot be distinguished <br />by style. Arent you contradicting? Thats why I say that, the <br />hypothesis that a particular style is used in a certain period is <br />negated by the fact that similar style can be used at different <br />period. So both go hand in hand and only facts cannot lead us to <br />anywhere.

If we dont get the facts we <br />say our initial understanding was wrong. Hope you atlest agree with <br />this. This is what happened in the case of Kanchi and Mamallapuram, <br />which I tried to point out.</p>
<p>Reg. Sculpture. Again I think I didnt put my points clearly. I never <br />said that the icon in the sculpture or painting should be mentioned. <br />What i said is determining the period of an art piece by looking at <br />it. again we do a pattern matching and if we find similarities <br />between two, for which we have proof for one, we conclude that the <br />other is of the same period. It can be Nataraja statue or a kotravi <br />or anyting. Identifying the period is my point of discussion and not <br />the diety. So we do identify a diety's period without any written <br />proof. Dont we? If we get a written proof which says our <br />understanding s wrong, we stand corrected. So facts will surely <br />supplement hypothesis, but Human brain first tends to devise <br />hypothesis rather than finding facts. I never linked this with the <br />painting which is called <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym . I was giving this example to <br />substantiate that assumptions do help us to find facts. If my words <br />misled you or Krupa, i beg pordon.</acronym></p>
<p>Lets take the example of Eka Veeri pidari. We did had the FACT from <br />the kalvettu that Eka Veeri Pidari existed. But what will you do <br />with the FACT alone. Its known that a kali statue is there, but the <br />location do not match with the place mentioned in kalvettu. Then a <br />hypothesis can be conceived that this statue could have been brought <br />from there, which was confirmed by the local people. So you say you <br />have discovered Eka veeri. Could you hae done this only with the <br />Kalvettu? If you say yes, I dont have an answer. Probably I am so <br />ignorant to understand such great things.</p>
<p>The basic thing is, no one knows clearly as what happened. We try to <br />derive history from whatever we have at hand. The more the evidence <br />the more the better. We should understand this basics.</p>

<p>It is true that architects and engineers played major role in temple<br />construction. But why there are no temples like Rajarajeswaram, <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym <br />and Darasuram built during other king's periods?

Don't the Kalvettus have the<br />information of who was the chief architect behind the construction of that<br />temple. A kIng alone can;t just bring changes in Architecture / Engineering<br />of a temple. There might be a Ayanar like person involved in the contruction<br />of all these temples. Can anybody mention such people?</p>

<p>Satish,</p>
<p>Such pOdhikai is called as 'kuzhavup pOdhikai'. It was introduced<br />during the period of Paranthaka I and Adhitha I. As Krupa said, it is<br />not necessary that all parts of architecture should change over a<br />period of time. Still we see some tharangap pOdhikai (introduced by<br />Mahendra I) in later chola temples. POdhikais are not the only<br />parameter for judging the period.</p>
<p>Read my article on pOdhikai for more clarifications.</p>

<p>If <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  hadn't mentioned that he built kshethrabalar shrine, we can<br />come to the conclusion that it was built by either Paranthaka or after<br />him. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  introduced 'vettup pOdhikai'. Till then 'kuzhavu pOdhikai'<br />was used. It is possible that kshethrabalar shrine was built before<br />the vettup pOdhikai was introduced.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Regarding sculptures and paintings, based on certain features only we<br />can say the period. We cannot expect the name of the person to be<br />carved under each sculpture or painting. We all accept that the person<br />sitting on the elephant is Sundarar and person on the horse is<br />Cheraman perumal. Is there any name mentioned there? The evidences are<br />in the literature. The sculptures like Dhakshinamurthy and Bikshadanar<br />are known to us from Puranams. They also dont carry names under/above<br />that. But to say so and so person is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , where are the evidences that<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  will look like this? One of the features of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  we know very well<br />from Thiruvalangadu CPs are the sangu/chakra rekhai in his palms.<br />Where are they shown in the painting or sculpture which is considered<br />to be <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ?</p>

<p>First of all, nobody had any hypothesis denying the lingam is<br />periyakoil's just because there is no kalvettu below it. It might be a<br />possibility, that is all.</p>
<p>Second, the same people could have thought there is a possibility had<br />the entire periya kovil been covered with gold if at least the words<br />"pon vimaanam" were there. The actual inscription text that scholars<br />can make out is as follows:</p>
<p>""raajaraajeswaram udaiyaar koyil sri vimaanam pon".</p>
<p>Note, not even "pon vimaanam". After this the lines are not clear. The<br />inscription is extremely damaged. Actually not everyone is sure of<br />even the word "pon". So it is clear that there is no mention of gold<br />vimaanam.</p>

        <p>I guess the Tamil kings had atleast the courtesy not<br />to destroy temples and places of worship. Thats why<br />most of the temples and what ever kalvettu they had<br />survived the waves of changing politics.</p>
<p>Even the cankam age brahmi inscriptions carry the same<br />tone - who donated what to which saint for what<br />purpose etc., Only a few bear kings names. This might<br />have been the trend since civilization.</p>
<p>So the people had the authority and literacy to issue<br />local kalvettus that marked donations. These were of<br />little interest to the kings, so they survived<br />perhaps.</p>

<blockquote><p>  thousands of kalvettu may have been in palaces. the<br />  enemies destroyed <br />  the palaces perhaps irritated at the content.</p>
<p>  in chola land palaces were destroyed by invading<br />  pandyas who destroyed <br />  the palaces, ploughed the land and sowed crops( they<br />  were just doing <br />  what the cholas did in madurai 2 centuries earlier)</p>
<p>  an entire place area in gkc (maaligaimedu???) was<br />  thus destroyed and <br />  with them the kalvettu.</p>
<p>  one case of a kalvettu being erased deliberately was<br />  pointed to us by <br />  ram in the pallipadai of panchavan madevi.</p>
<p>  the word palli padai was erased purposefully. that<br />  was perhaps to <br />  remove the negative aspect of the temple and<br />  encourage more people to <br />  go there.</p>
<p>  the kalvettus at the destroyed palaces may have been<br />  more useful for <br />  their historical content.temple kalvettus dont give<br />  direct info about <br />  history and they have to read with a generous dollop<br />  of imagination.</p>

        <p>the style of sculpture and architecture</p>
<p>the masons and the sculptors must have been trainees under one man or <br />a school of thought during one era.</p>
<p>or they may have all followed the design prevalent at that time.</p>
<p>i certainly dont feel that the royalty had the time or energy to <br />stand by and supervise these things.<br />definitely the style of art remained similar during an era- in <br />sculpture, painting or architecture.thus being a great tool in <br />identifying the era.<br />perhaps that was because it was a proven concept or prevailing <br />fashion.<br />changes started occuring when creativity on part of the artist crept <br />in.<br />or people from faraway moved in.<br />this is common in technology also. for example the huge chinese <br />fishing nets we find in cochin have exactly the same design in far <br />east.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Of course no one can exclude a possibility if there is no evidence<br />  against it. 100% true that such a possibility exists, I never denied<br />  THE possibility. But saying it IS RJC is different from it MAY BE <br />RJC.<br />  illayaa?</p>
<p>  Reg. that tharanga poadhigai concept. I dont know about it. Maybe<br />  Kamal will give evidence if such a style had Parantaka's kalvettu<br />  below it or any other inference to support that. But there we cannot<br />  say that other kings did not build temples with the same style.</p>
<p>  Identifying a sculpture's period is entirely different from saying <br />the<br />  name of a person in a sculpture. It is so because at least we have <br />one<br />  conclusive evidence in the first case, whereas in the second case<br />  (identifying a person in a sculpture), we dont have any evidence on<br />  both the places. If we know for sure at least one person is Rajendra<br />  Chozha, then we can say both of them are RJC who built the temple.<br />  Again, I dont deny the possibility.</p>
<p>  Regarding your monalisa example, I would like to add more.</p>
<p>  The subject in the instance you gave is the name of the person in <br />the<br />  painting, not its period. So when it was replicated, it would be <br />done<br />  on a different canvas, or photographed. Still we can identify it as<br />  Monolisa. The point here is we are able to say WHO IT IS by seeing <br />the<br />  face and smile.</p>
<p>  Now if you want to say all the replicated mona lisa were painted<br />  during the same period by different people, the first criteria <br />should<br />  be all the canvasas should be of the same period. So seeing the type<br />  of canvas, its weight, the dust in the canvas, the condition of the<br />  canvas, we can safely say it is this much or that much old. Then we<br />  can conclude that all the paintings were made on the same <br />date/period.</p>
<p>  So identification of the person requires different parameters than<br />  identifying the period of the canvas.</p>
<p>  The features of the sculpture would help us to say whether a <br />sculpture<br />  is of pallava's or chozha's. We cant say who is there in the sirppam<br />  by seeing the features. We determine if a sculpture is a Murugan or<br />  Shiva by using different parameters (like senni, virisadai, etc.), <br />not<br />  features.</p>
<p>    Even Dr.Kkv said that people were carried away by this hypothesis <br />    for so long that kanchi kailasanathar and mamallapuram temples <br />were <br />    built by different person because of the dissimilarities. Unless <br />    this hypothesis was broken down with proof, all belived that <br />    mamallapuram was built by mahendra and narasimha. Dont you agree <br />on <br />    this?</p>
<p>    So facts alone can mislead sometimes and hypothesis do help us. I <br />    feel both compliment each other.</p>
<p>  See now. The hypothesis mislead and facts helped us to identify who<br />  built the temple. Why did people believe kailasanathar and<br />  mamallapuram temples were built by mahendra/maamalla? Must be on the<br />  hypothesis that both of them were on pallava region and mahendra and<br />  narasimha were famous. Could be otherwise? Okay, so this<br />  belief/hypothesis was proved false by the dissimilarities which is <br />a FACT </p>

<p>      of a person who built the temple, I have nothing to say; it is a<br />      possibility, not truth. If you are going to call THIS a <br />    hypothesis, go<br />      ahead. This need not be disproved, as possibilities cannot be<br />      disproved; rather a possibility can only be further researched.</p>
<p>    Krupa,<br />    we are indeed sailing on the same boat. I too mean the same. Its <br />a <br />    POSSIBILITY. So you too accept that its a possibility. In that <br />case <br />    you cannot argue that its totally false unless proved wrong or <br />    right. Thats what I mean to say. </p>
<p>      I dont know what made you call Kamal's answer as a simple <br />answer, <br />    and<br />      I cannot understand the reason behind the question why <br />something <br />    did<br />      not change because some other thing changed...like architecture<br />      changed in 30 years but tharanga podhigai did not change even <br />after<br />      150 years.</p>
<p>      Also, I beg to differ from your statement that history cannot be<br />      written without hypothesis. After all, all of us would love to <br />know<br />      100% true history, dont we?</p>
<p>      Krupa</p>
<p>    I quoted Kamal only as an example. If we go by the taranga <br />podigai <br />    concept alone, we will be misled. So in this case even facts that <br />    such a style was practiced during parantaka, are proven wrong. <br />    Unless we go for hypothesis like, same style can be used by other <br />    kings as well, then the kalvettu will suppliment the hypothesis <br />to <br />    make it a fact. Otherwise the facts we will belive will be <br />    kshetrabalar temple was built during parantaka, but RRj inscribed <br />    that he built it. Hope I am making myself clear that some facts <br />    cannot be taken directly.</p>
<p>    Lets also take the sirpams we see in the temples. By seeing a <br />    sculpture itself Dr.KKV or you varalaaru team are able to <br />identify <br />    which period it is. I dont think any sculpture has a kalvettu <br />below <br />    it saying it was chisled in so and so era by so and so king....<br />    but when we find similarity between sculptures, then we say its <br />    chozha or pallava etc. Mona lisa was replicated thousands of time <br />    and even today people can mimic the same. Does this mean all the <br />    mona lisa were paited during the same period by different people? <br />    Similarly a good sculpture can even mimic the same anatomy as <br />    followed by chozha, if the sculptur really has the talent to do <br />so. <br />    Then seeing the similarity its very well possible that we can <br />    conclude that its chozha period. </p>
<p>    But the scholars will be able to do by carbon dating or any other <br />    scietific method. But on the first look its very much possible <br />that <br />    we can conclude both belong to the same period. So in identifying <br />    the chozha sculptures we do use hypothesis, like the anatomy <br />looks <br />    similar, so its of chozha period etc.</p></shankarkrupa@y...></satisharun@g...></p></blockquote>

        <p>thousands of kalvettu may have been in palaces. the enemies destroyed <br />the palaces perhaps irritated at the content.</p>
<p>in chola land palaces were destroyed by invading pandyas who destroyed <br />the palaces, ploughed the land and sowed crops( they were just doing <br />what the cholas did in madurai 2 centuries earlier)</p>
<p>an entire place area in <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  (maaligaimedu???) was thus destroyed and <br />with them the kalvettu.</acronym></p>
<p>one case of a kalvettu being erased deliberately was pointed to us by <br />ram in the pallipadai of panchavan madevi.</p>
<p>the word palli padai was erased purposefully. that was perhaps to <br />remove the negative aspect of the temple and encourage more people to <br />go there.</p>
<p>the kalvettus at the destroyed palaces may have been more useful for <br />their historical content.temple kalvettus dont give direct info about <br />history and they have to read with a generous dollop of imagination.</p>

        <p>Question: Why did conquering empire not destroy Kalvettu in the<br />conquered country? Does this mean the kalvettus were very close to the<br />truth or only hidden kalvettus survived to see our times <br />- There is no evidence that the conquering empire did not destroy the<br />kalvettus in a country. So Possibility 1: There is a possibility what<br />we see is the remaining kalvettus if the kings had such a practice.<br />Possibility 2: They dont have the habit of destroying the kalvettus or<br />were cunning enough to hide other's glory. We have or had all of them<br />intact in place.</p>
<p>Question: the kings intelligently inscribed on places like temple<br />walls which no hindu king will dare to touch.</p>
<p>- Inscribing text on temple walls was in practice even when enemy was<br />not a Saivitte/Vaishnavaitte. Therefore this excludes the possibility<br />that kalvettus were free from attack when inscribed on a temple wall.<br />Only possibility is the appropriateness of the place for the<br />particular purpose (kovil patriya seidhigal kovilgalildhaan irukkanum).</p>

<p>  Does this mean the kalvettus were very close to the truth (or) that<br />only <br />  hidden kalvettus survived to see our times (or) the kings intelligently <br />  inscribed on places like temple walls which no hindu king will dare to <br />  touch.</p>
<p>  Copper plates could have easily been hidden. Hence, the doubt is<br />regarding <br />  kalvettus only.</p>

        <p>Of course no one can exclude a possibility if there is no evidence<br />against it. 100% true that such a possibility exists, I never denied<br />THE possibility. But saying it IS RJC is different from it MAY BE RJC.<br />illayaa?</p>
<p>Reg. that tharanga poadhigai concept. I dont know about it. Maybe<br />Kamal will give evidence if such a style had Parantaka's kalvettu<br />below it or any other inference to support that. But there we cannot<br />say that other kings did not build temples with the same style.</p>
<p>Identifying a sculpture's period is entirely different from saying the<br />name of a person in a sculpture. It is so because at least we have one<br />conclusive evidence in the first case, whereas in the second case<br />(identifying a person in a sculpture), we dont have any evidence on<br />both the places. If we know for sure at least one person is Rajendra<br />Chozha, then we can say both of them are RJC who built the temple.<br />Again, I dont deny the possibility.</p>
<p>Regarding your monalisa example, I would like to add more.</p>
<p>The subject in the instance you gave is the name of the person in the<br />painting, not its period. So when it was replicated, it would be done<br />on a different canvas, or photographed. Still we can identify it as<br />Monolisa. The point here is we are able to say WHO IT IS by seeing the<br />face and smile.</p>
<p>Now if you want to say all the replicated mona lisa were painted<br />during the same period by different people, the first criteria should<br />be all the canvasas should be of the same period. So seeing the type<br />of canvas, its weight, the dust in the canvas, the condition of the<br />canvas, we can safely say it is this much or that much old. Then we<br />can conclude that all the paintings were made on the same date/period.</p>
<p>So identification of the person requires different parameters than<br />identifying the period of the canvas.</p>
<p>The features of the sculpture would help us to say whether a sculpture<br />is of pallava's or chozha's. We cant say who is there in the sirppam<br />by seeing the features. We determine if a sculpture is a Murugan or<br />Shiva by using different parameters (like senni, virisadai, etc.), not<br />features.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Even Dr.Kkv said that people were carried away by this hypothesis <br />  for so long that kanchi kailasanathar and mamallapuram temples were <br />  built by different person because of the dissimilarities. Unless <br />  this hypothesis was broken down with proof, all belived that <br />  mamallapuram was built by mahendra and narasimha. Dont you agree on <br />  this?</p>
<p>  So facts alone can mislead sometimes and hypothesis do help us. I <br />  feel both compliment each other.</p></blockquote>
<p>See now. The hypothesis mislead and facts helped us to identify who<br />built the temple. Why did people believe kailasanathar and<br />mamallapuram temples were built by mahendra/maamalla? Must be on the<br />hypothesis that both of them were on pallava region and mahendra and<br />narasimha were famous. Could be otherwise? Okay, so this<br />belief/hypothesis was proved false by the dissimilarities which is a FACT </p>

<p>    I dont know what made you call Kamal's answer as a simple answer, <br />  and<br />    I cannot understand the reason behind the question why something <br />  did<br />    not change because some other thing changed...like architecture<br />    changed in 30 years but tharanga podhigai did not change even after<br />    150 years.</p>
<p>    Also, I beg to differ from your statement that history cannot be<br />    written without hypothesis. After all, all of us would love to know<br />    100% true history, dont we?</p>
<p>    Krupa</p>
<p>  I quoted Kamal only as an example. If we go by the taranga podigai <br />  concept alone, we will be misled. So in this case even facts that <br />  such a style was practiced during parantaka, are proven wrong. <br />  Unless we go for hypothesis like, same style can be used by other <br />  kings as well, then the kalvettu will suppliment the hypothesis to <br />  make it a fact. Otherwise the facts we will belive will be <br />  kshetrabalar temple was built during parantaka, but RRj inscribed <br />  that he built it. Hope I am making myself clear that some facts <br />  cannot be taken directly.</p>
<p>  Lets also take the sirpams we see in the temples. By seeing a <br />  sculpture itself Dr.KKV or you varalaaru team are able to identify <br />  which period it is. I dont think any sculpture has a kalvettu below <br />  it saying it was chisled in so and so era by so and so king....<br />  but when we find similarity between sculptures, then we say its <br />  chozha or pallava etc. Mona lisa was replicated thousands of time <br />  and even today people can mimic the same. Does this mean all the <br />  mona lisa were paited during the same period by different people? <br />  Similarly a good sculpture can even mimic the same anatomy as <br />  followed by chozha, if the sculptur really has the talent to do so. <br />  Then seeing the similarity its very well possible that we can <br />  conclude that its chozha period. </p>
<p>  But the scholars will be able to do by carbon dating or any other <br />  scietific method. But on the first look its very much possible that <br />  we can conclude both belong to the same period. So in identifying <br />  the chozha sculptures we do use hypothesis, like the anatomy looks <br />  similar, so its of chozha period etc.</p></shankarkrupa@y...></p></blockquote>

<p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>Here comes the difficulty. When two persons are not in the same frame<br />of mind, one person's argument with proof may seem to other as just a<br />mockery. If one cannot understand the proof given, the proof is set<br />aside and the persons arguing would be called "mocking the other".</p>

As Sampath rightly pointed out, <br />  null hyposthesis though not foolproof, is the only way out to find <br />  out whether our hypothesis is correct or not. If proven, correct, <br />  else incorrect.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would differ from you on this point of forming a hypothesis to "get<br />a full picture." I feel it is wiser to accept the fact we cannot make<br />it out clearly when there is no evidence rather than forming a theory<br />and "creating a full picture." If one wishes to conclude something<br />based on hypothesis, it is all right and he/she can go ahead. No one<br />is going to question him/her. However, the created picture would at no<br />point show what is history. If you feel this statement is not<br />acceptable, then our definition of the term history differs. We are<br />not sailing on the same boat.</p>
<p>If you feel that no fool will project the same common devotee in two<br />different places, then you have a point. There must be a meaning. But<br />based on this statement if you are going to conclude it is the picture<br />of a person who built the temple, I have nothing to say; it is a<br />possibility, not truth. If you are going to call THIS a hypothesis, go<br />ahead. This need not be disproved, as possibilities cannot be<br />disproved; rather a possibility can only be further researched.</p>
<p>I dont know what made you call Kamal's answer as a simple answer, and<br />I cannot understand the reason behind the question why something did<br />not change because some other thing changed...like architecture<br />changed in 30 years but tharanga podhigai did not change even after<br />150 years.</p>
<p>Also, I beg to differ from your statement that history cannot be<br />written without hypothesis. After all, all of us would love to know<br />100% true history, dont we?</p>
<p>Krupa</p>

        <p>Excellent satish</p>
<p>to formulate a hypothesis is everybody's right<br />we saw it happen in the entrance to the periya koil<br />two words, pon and vimanam(?)<br />the hypothesis is an extreme one.the entire vimana of periya koil was <br />covered with gold.</p>
<p>such a stupendous feat would definitely have found mention else where.</p>
<p>and that would have been the single most expensive thing in the temple <br />costs. why was it not mentioned in the kalvettu?</p>
<p>so every kalvettu, every copper plate and every literary mention is <br />subject to many things that corrupt the truth<br />sychophancy, exuberance, poetric nature can all enhance the content <br />appearance and thereby lowering its intrinsic truth<br />so everybody has a right to have an opinion and others cannot mock it.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Excellent points Sampath. Good food for thought. </p>
<p>Krupa, Samptha and all,</p>
<p>I too feel History cannot be purely facts. Even though we get <br />inscriptions, a percentage of hypothesis only can give full picture <br />to what we read from inscriptions. As Sampath rightly pointed out, <br />null hyposthesis though not foolproof, is the only way out to find <br />out whether our hypothesis is correct or not. If proven, correct, <br />else incorrect.</p>
<p>Lets take our own debate, whether the paintings are of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  or not. <br />One group says its not while the other says it is. But either of the <br />group dont have proof. In this case, the statement of hypothesis can <br />be framed as per the groups wish and can be proved or disproved. If <br />you frame the statement you can easily disprove it and if I frame <br />the statement with the opposite meaning I can prove it. Just a <br />thought flashed in my mind. I remember seeing a similar posture of <br />the painting with a male and a couple of females standing and <br />praying as a miniature sculpture in Mappedu gopuram near Arakkonam, <br />which is supposed to be constructed by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . I dont have further <br />details or proof, we can analyse. So as of now I have two instance <br />where the persons looks similar and no fool will project the same <br />COMMON MAN/DEVOTEE in two differnt places he has built. </acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Similarly, in Rams photo collection of <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  photos I saw a sculpture <br />very much similar to the one in Panchavan madevi pallipadai, one <br />kudumi asami praying before a siva lingam. Both the temples are <br />built by <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym . I think you will accept that both were built by <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  <br />becuase you have FACT for them.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>If I create a null hypothesis with these evidences i have, I can <br />prove that they are indeed <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym . If you creat the null <br />hypothese you can disprove it in your own way. </acronym></p>
<p>As sampath said, as long as a theory has been disproved, it will be <br />accepted as fact. And History cannot be written without hypothesis. <br />If I construct a temple, you can very well put a kalvettu there <br />saying that you built it and after 100 years, that becomes history. <br />I am just talking about possibilities. No offense meant my friend.</p>
<p>You talk about evidences and facts. But I would say what you say <br />also maynot be 100% true. Another instance I can quote.</p>
<p>When we were in Pullamangai, Kamal showed a pillar with tarangam and <br />said such taranga podigai with one tarangam in the opposite <br />direction means its of parantaka period. In tiruvalanchuzhi <br />kshetrabalar temple I foudn a very striking similarity between <br />pullamangai pillar and this pillar. And the kalvettu's says <br />kshetrabalar sannidhi was built by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . When I showed this to Kamal <br />and asked why there is a conflict, the simple answer was,"its not <br />that all such taranga podigai are of parantaka, but parantaka and <br />later". I think there is around 150 years gap between these two <br />temples and from Venkatesh I learn that in 40 years, the chola <br />architecture reached its pinnacle from mazhapadi to periya koil. If <br />in just 40 years things can change, why the taranga podigai didt <br />change for nearly 150 years.</acronym></p>
<p>Can I say Kamal or the source from where Kamal got his information <br />is totally wrong? I can and I cannot, depending on how well I <br />project my hypothesis. </p>
<p>What i mean to say is, its easy to mock others for their aruguement, <br />just for arguement sake. but its difficult to prove or disprove. <br />Each one can have their own school of thought, and its their <br />freedom. If we can , we should prove them otherwise else we should <br />not comment on them as long as we dont have evidences supporting our <br />arguement.</p>

<p>Thalaiva,</p>
<p>B.V spoke about "Male servants" of Rajarajan being from bhramin <br />community.I dont know what is meant by "Male servants".What does <br />that indicate?Cook,body guard,ordinary servants..I dont know.Maybe <br />BV misunderstood bhramdeya villages as bhramdeya community,but I <br />dont understand the logic behind appointing people hailing only from <br />certain villages.I can understand certain communities,because that <br />was how our society was organized then.</p>
<p>One small correction to the title of the thread "Is raja raja an <br />egoist?".The word egoist doesnt mean a person who is full of <br />headweight and arrogance.Egoist means a selfish person.The correct <br />word might be egomaniac or ego-centric.</p>
<p>regards<br />sampath</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  So I understand NHST accepts a hypothesis as not false because <br />there<br />  is less falsity.</p>
<p>  It is also true that we can reject a hypothesis in history if <br />there is<br />  zero percentage of truth with full falsity.</p>
<p>  As SB Sir and Sankaran have pointed out, not all of Rajaraja <br />Chola's<br />  employees were from the same caste/family. So the hypothesis of BV<br />  that ALL of his employees shall be rejected. Oh well, most of his<br />  employees is different from ALL of his employees, because there <br />can be<br />  either THIS or THAT. Therefore the hypothesis/observation that<br />  Rajaraja is Egoist (because he wanted to control a particular <br />caste as<br />  his servants) is also not true.</p>

<p>      Aside from that, from what you have said NHST is to find out <br />what <br />    is wrong and what is right, right? I take it NHST concludes <br />    hypothesis in history would turn the path of a researcher to <br />find <br />    proof for his theory whereas it would be more apt to conclude <br />    issues based on facts and correlation.</p>
<p>    ---------- No.NHST says "Given the null hypothesis is true what <br />is <br />    the probablity that the data we have in our hand is a wrong <br />    data?"If the probablity is less than 0.05 we reject the null <br />    hypothesis.That indicates that the research has succeeded.</p>
<p>    It doesnt say anything about truth or falsity of the <br />    hypothesis.Actually in science no hypothesis can ever be proved <br />to <br />    be true or untrue.Many researchers misunderstand NHST and P&lt;0.05 <br />to <br />    indicate "What is the probablity that this hypothesis is <br />    false?".That is a popular myth in research field.</p>
<p>    I take it NHST concludes hypothesis in<br />    history would turn the path of a researcher to find proof for his<br />    theory whereas it would be more apt to conclude issues based on <br />facts<br />    and correlation.</p>
<p>    ------- History has very little quantitative research.Research <br />based <br />    on "facts" is not-existant.Actually thomas kuhn says that a <br />    scientist doesnt search for 'facts' in research.Maybe you are <br />    talking about theory driven research,but the concept of fact and <br />    truth are contradictory to the ideas of science and <br />research.Truth <br />    is not a goal of scientific enquiry according to kuhn.</p>
<p>    Correlation research too needs hypothesis <br />testing.Actually <br />    only some fields of historical research can be quantified.Again <br />that <br />    depends on the nature of enquiry.To research social status of <br />chola <br />    people we need less quantitative tools.But to find out whether <br />most <br />    of Rjaraja's employees were bhramins we need to use NHST.</p>
