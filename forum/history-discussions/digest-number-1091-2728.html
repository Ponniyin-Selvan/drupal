<p>    In the past few days there is a strong debate going on that<br />  Kalvettu<br />    are the ultimate source of facts. We all are debating on<br />    the inscriptional evidences of various things.</p>
<p>    If we take a stand that inscriptions are FACTS, then what I posted<br />    is just a FACT.</p>
<p>  dear sathish<br />  just because its inscribed on stone does it become a fact???</p>
<p>  if the presence of an inscription proves a point does the abscence of<br />  an inscription negate the point</p>
<p>  for example<br />  the absence of a kalvettu under rrcs painting in the upper floors of<br />  big temple made experts say its not him.<br />  where as all logic points to him</p>
<p>  the same way the absence of a kalvettu about karuvur thevar has made<br />  the experts say that he did not live along with rrc.<br />  infact those who read his thiruvisaipa and its description of thanjai<br />  in its hey days will understad its an eye witness account.<br />  it is being brushed under the carpet because no kalvettu mentions him</p>
<p>  is it not a costly mistake if we are wrong?????</p>
<p>  perhaps the only eye witness account is made to lose its credibility<br />  because of over dependence on kalvettus.</p>
<p>  but i for one would rather beleive a venerable saint than a sculptor<br />  working as a stenographer.</p>

<p>  Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  I am much impressed with your reading Thirumurais meticulously now<br />  with a specific agenda. It is not FINDING TIME as such, it is the<br />  INCLINATION TO FIND TIME is more impressive.</p>
<p>  Of late, I was remembering Tiruvalluvar again and again:</p>

<p>    Kamal, We have discussed this programme among us. Pls work out some<br />    progm.</p>
<p>    First Step :: Those interested in Overseas Visit, PLEASE KEEP YOUR<br />    PASSPORT ready.</p>
<p>    anbudan / sps</p>
<p>  I suggest to have this trip sometime in March 2006. There are 2 reasons.</p>
<p>  1. Till february, it will be winter in south east asia countries.</p>
<p>  2. We need enough time to plan ourselves financially as it involves<br />  big amount.</p>
<p>  Also it gives window for the first time flyers to arrange their passport.</p>
<p>  Step 1 : Collecting the location details.</p>
<p>  Country name - Place name (nearest airport) - Temple name combination<br />  for each temple in south east asia.</p>
<p>  Step 2 : Deciding feasible route and number of days calculation.</p>
<p>  Step 3 : Collecting air fare and accommodation details for cost<br />  estimation. As for the air fare, we (myself and Lavanya) found that<br />  Thai airlines is economical.</p>
<p>  Step 4 : Finalising participants list. The reason for this step being<br />  next to cost estimation is that last minute drop outs cannot be afforded.</p>
<p>  Step 5 : Other arrangements pertaining to overseas travel.</p>
<p>  All those who have visited earlier, please provide the details to plan<br />  effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>  Thanks<br />  Kamal</p>

<p>  Dear Venketesh,</p>
<p>  I just didn't like the rather supercilious tone of the narrator especially<br />  when dealing with the religious aspects. I have frequently seen this; when<br />  christianity or Islam or Judaism is being presented there is some sort of<br />  "hushed reverance".. when discussing other religious beliefs both living <br />  and<br />  extinct (like the Egyptian) there is this strong undercurrent of<br />  superciliousness. And I am saying this despite not being particulary<br />  religious. :)</p>
<p>  Cheers,</p>
<p>  Arun</p>

<p>          It is our ambition to bring forth History in its True Nature -<br />    or<br />          atleast without adultering - using the skills of devoated<br />    Scholars.<br />          Let us say we are talking of Kalyana Saapaadu.</p>

<p>  I too read 'chariot of gods' when I was in school and was fascinated<br />  by it. It talked about so many places and so many things that I was<br />  mesmerised. But as I grew, I started doubting everything in it.<br />  Finally once I was introduced to Sagan, Hawking, Penrose, Feynman et<br />  al, I understood what made me doubt in the first place.</p>
<p>  "Making an hypothesis is not science; it's what you do with an<br />  hypothesis that more or less is science and is to be judged by<br />  others. Von D�niken is entitled to his hypothesis. But what does he<br />  do with it? "<br />  Read more, <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/7601/daniken.html" title="http://www.csicop.org/si/7601/daniken.html">http://www.csicop.org/si/7601/daniken.html</a></p>
<p>  Instead, I would recommend 'Guns, germs and steel' by Jared Diamond,<br />  a book worthy of read and analysis by this group.</p>
<p>  Of course, I am not an expert on commenting on the discussions<br />  here. I am more inclined towards the literary value of PS than its<br />  historical context.</p>
<p>  Based on my readings, I am actually surprised that we have the<br />  Romans leave so much of textual, architectural and other evidences<br />  while we have a king coming in 1000 years after the Romans, yet<br />  leave so little evidence as to his reign and the general socio-<br />  economic dimension of the rule. Although there are inscriptional<br />  evidences, it is still inadequate to reconstruct the life of an<br />  ordinary person during RRC/RJC times. This actually leave a lot of<br />  gaps and a lot of scope for assumptions and hypothesis (which has<br />  been used to the hilt by the Dravida parties!).</p>
<p>  Is it because our kings wrote in the palmyra leaves which got<br />  decomposed/destroyed etc?. I remember Tamil thatha's efforts in<br />  recovering the 'eadu's from the various villages and persons. I dont<br />  think this work was continued after him. Do we know of any palmyra<br />  leaves written during the RRC/RJC times?.</p>

<p>  The lost empire explored<br />  By David Keys</p>
<p>  Deep in the south of India lie the spectacular remains of one of the<br />  world's most remarkable and most forgotten civilsations. In its<br />  heyday it was one of the half-dozen greatest powers on Earth. It<br />  controlled half a million square miles - more than five times the<br />  size of Britain. And under its wing literacy and the arts flourished.</p>
<p>  Yet today, 1,000 years later, the Chola Empire is remembered only by<br />  a handful of specialist historians. If it had been European, or had<br />  given its name to some still-surviving nation, things might be<br />  different. But despite 400 years of glory, the Chola Empire<br />  disappeared from history; a sad fate for a civilisation which was<br />  among the most remarkable produced by the medieval world.</p>
<p>  In some ways, it was the most significant of the dozen or so empires<br />  which rose and fell during India's long, tumultuous history. It<br />  lasted some 460 years, longer than any of them. The Chola was also<br />  the only Asian empire (bar the Japanese) to have indulged, albeit<br />  briefly, in overseas expansion. It conquered Sri Lanka, the Andaman<br />  and Nicobar islands and, temporarily, parts of south-east Asia - the<br />  islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali, and the southern part of the<br />  Malay peninsula.</p>
<p>  Most of these overseas conquests are shrouded in mystery. All that<br />  is known is that, in 1025, the Chola emperor Rajendra I dispatched<br />  an army, presumably on a large fleet, across 2000 miles of ocean to<br />  conquer the southern half of south-east Asia. The records show that<br />  he succeeded and received the submission of large numbers of cities.<br />  Some historians believe that the Cholas then simply sailed back to<br />  India, but others suspect that Chola power persisted in some form in<br />  south-east Asia for two or three generations.</p>
<p>  Certainly, the Chola conquest contributed to a long process that had<br />  already started and which linked southern India and south-east Asia<br />  together in terms of trade and religion. The Indonesia/Malay region<br />  was a pivotal point in trade between China and India (and, indeed,<br />  the West), and both Java and Bali were largely Hindu. Rajendra's<br />  conquest was perhaps the first military expression of a more general<br />  connection which had been developing for centuries.</p>
<p>  Closer to home, in Sri Lanka, the Cholas' overseas expansion is<br />  better documented, both in text, and in stone. Tourists today can<br />  still explore the great ruined city of Polonnaruva, founded by the<br />  Cholas as a capital for their newly conquered island territory.</p>
<p>  But the emperor's armies didn't only head southwards. In the early<br />  11th century, Chola forces marched almost 1000 miles through India<br />  to the banks of the Ganges. Like the south-east Asian conquest, this<br />  epic ''long march'' is also shrouded in mystery. Whether the<br />  emperor's objectives in marching an army<br />  to the sacred river were political or purely religious is unknown.<br />  Certainly, the north of India, though temporarily subdued, was not<br />  incorporated into the empire - although holy Ganges water was<br />  carried back to a great new capital named in honour of the sacred<br />  river, and the ruler who had conquered it.</p>
<p>  This capital was called Gangaikondacholapuram - literally ''the City<br />  to which the Chola emperor brought the Ganges''. At the centre of<br />  their new metropolis, the Cholas built a magnificent temple and a<br />  vast three mile-long reservoir symbolically to hold the ''captured''<br />  waters of the Ganges. Both have survived. Under Chola rule, religion<br />  and politics grew ever closer together, with the emperor projecting<br />  himself as the representative, almost a manifestation, of God on<br />  Earth. Large temples were built, for the first time, as royal<br />  establishments. The Cholas probably built more temples than any<br />  other Indian kingdom or empire. Each temple was a masterpiece. Even<br />  today, the Chola heartland - along the Kaveri River in the state of<br />  Tamil Nadu - is full of beautiful, delicately carved temples, some<br />  the size of tiny chapels, others as big as European cathedrals. In<br />  the very centre of what was the empire, there are still 40 Chola<br />  temples in an area half the size of greater London. The most<br />  spectacular structure is the 63m-high pyramid- shaped centralshrine<br />  in the city of Thanjavur, the Chola capital before<br />  Gangaikondacholapuram.</p>
<p>  Chola art and architecture were among the finest in the world.<br />  Indeed, in cast bronze sculpture and hard-stone sculpture, Chola art<br />  is unsurpassed. Millions of figures, deftly carved in granite, can<br />  still be seen on their temples, while in museums, in Thanjavur and<br />  Madras, visitors can marvel at the artistry and craftsmanship of the<br />  bronze figurines and statues.</p>
<p>  The Cholas not only nurtured an artistic boom; they also fostered a<br />  massive expansion in education. Political stability and imperial<br />  grants - both to the temples which ran education and to the students<br />  themselves - led to the expansion of local schools and elite<br />  colleges for higher castes. The education system - which operated<br />  from a religious perspective but also promoted literacy, mathematics<br />  and astronomy - was probably, at least in part, responsible for the<br />  development of a competent imperial administration and broadened<br />  international horizons. Some estimates suggest that literacy rose to<br />  around 20 per cent - perhaps the highest in the medieval world.</p>
<p>  An unplanned result of this high level of education was an increase<br />  in intellectual dissidence. One of the greatest Indian religious<br />  thinkers - the 11th-century philosopher Ramanuja - was a product of<br />  the Chola empire, although he was ultimately expelled for his views.<br />  In many ways, he can be seen as the founder of Hindu monotheism with<br />  his belief in a<br />  unitary personal god, the ultimate font of love and compassion.</p>
<p>  In the 12th century there flourished an even more dissident<br />  religious movement. The Lingayats professed a sort of cynical<br />  humanism which questioned the very fundamentals of religion - the<br />  authority of India's holy books, the Vedas (the equivalent of the<br />  Bible), and reincarnation itself. Socially, they were also radical,<br />  challenging the taboo on widows re-marrying, and condemning child<br />  marriages. This dissident movement derived much support from the<br />  lower castes.</p>
<p>  The empire also increased the importance and institutionalisation of<br />  local government. Each group of five to 10 villages had an elected<br />  district council, which in turn had endless sub-committees dealing<br />  with everything from land rights to irrigation, law and order to<br />  food storage. Every household in a district had the right to vote -<br />  and the councils enjoyed considerable power. The Chola emperors<br />  encouraged their development, probably as a counter-balance to the<br />  power of local vassal rulers, who owed obedience to the empire.</p>
<p>  Although the Cholas ruled for more than four centuries, they did so<br />  with a remarkable light touch. Local responsibility for local<br />  affairs was encouraged, and newly conquered local rulers were<br />  allowed to keep their titles and lands, though under ultimate Chola<br />  control.</p>
<p>  The light touch was brought even to waging war. The Cholas<br />  exemplified the Indian principle of war - the dharma yuddha,<br />  literally, the principle of the fair fight. Battles were normally<br />  pre- arranged and fought in daylight on a level field between equal<br />  numbers of troops. Defeated princes could carry on living and<br />  prospering, but had to pay homage and cough up tribute for the<br />  emperor's treasury and women to act as concubines<br />  and courtiers.</p>
<p>  Presiding over this mixture of autocracy and democracy, a cocktail<br />  of religious orthodoxy and dissidence, and a surge of artistic<br />  creativity - not to mention their concubines - the Chola emperors<br />  considered themselves the rulers of the world. They did, of course,<br />  look on India as the Continent of the Cosmos.</p>
<p>  Yet now they are forgotten, their achievements ignored by the world.<br />  There is not one book in print on the Chola Empire; nor a travel-<br />  company tour to most of their extraordinary temples.</p>

<p>  The empire also increased the importance and<br />  institutionalisation of<br />  local government. Each group of five to 10 villages<br />  had an elected<br />  district council, which in turn had endless<br />  sub-committees dealing<br />  with everything from land rights to irrigation, law<br />  and order to<br />  food storage. Every household in a district had the<br />  right to vote -<br />  and the councils enjoyed considerable power. The Chola<br />  emperors<br />  encouraged their development, probably as a<br />  counter-balance to the<br />  power of local vassal rulers, who owed obedience to<br />  the empire.</p>
<p>  Although the Cholas ruled for more than four<br />  centuries, they did so<br />  with a remarkable light touch. Local responsibility<br />  for local<br />  affairs was encouraged, and newly conquered local<br />  rulers were<br />  allowed to keep their titles and lands, though under<br />  ultimate Chola<br />  control.</p>
<p>  The light touch was brought even to waging war. The<br />  Cholas<br />  exemplified the Indian principle of war - the dharma<br />  yuddha,<br />  literally, the principle of the fair fight. Battles<br />  were normally<br />  pre- arranged and fought in daylight on a level field<br />  between equal<br />  numbers of troops. Defeated princes could carry on<br />  living and<br />  prospering, but had to pay homage and cough up tribute<br />  for the<br />  emperor's treasury and women to act as concubines<br />  and courtiers.</p>
<p>  Presiding over this mixture of autocracy and<br />  democracy, a cocktail<br />  of religious orthodoxy and dissidence, and a surge of<br />  artistic<br />  creativity - not to mention their concubines - the<br />  Chola emperors<br />  considered themselves the rulers of the world. They<br />  did, of course,<br />  look on India as the Continent of the Cosmos.</p>
<p>  Yet now they are forgotten, their achievements ignored<br />  by the world.<br />  There is not one book in print on the Chola Empire;<br />  nor a travel-<br />  company tour to most of their extraordinary temples.</p>
