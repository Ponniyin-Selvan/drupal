<p>A British Governor's romance with Ram Sethu </p>
<p>V SUNDARAM | Mon, 05 May, 2008 , 03:22 PM <br />. </p>
<p>It is reliably understood that in the ongoing Ram Sethu Case, the <br />Hon. Supreme Court of India asked the Senior Counsel <br />Sri.Venugopal `Did anybody request the Archeological Survey of India <br />(<acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym ) to undertake an extensive survey of the area in and around Ram <br />Sethu in Rameswaram, even prior to 1999?' The answer to this <br />question is straight and simple.</acronym></p>
<p>The Rt. Honourable Lord Pentland (1860-1925 )<br />Governor of Madras (1912-1919)</p>
<p>Lord Pentland, a British Governor of Madras Presidency from 1912 <br />to 1919, had a great fascination for Rameshwaram in general and Ram <br />Sethu in particular. Before coming to Madras in 1912, he had a <br />distinguished career as Secretary of Scotland and as Aide-de-Camp <br />and Official Secretary to Lord Aberdeen in Ireland in 1886 and in <br />Canada. He sat as Liberal member for Dumbartonshire and Forfarshire <br />in the House of Commons and acted as Parliamentary Secretary to Sir <br />Henry Campbell Bannerman for many years. He did outstanding War work <br />between 1914 and 1918 in the Presidency of Madras, ably assisted by <br />his public-spirited wife Lady Pentland. Both of them together raised <br />a large sum of money for building a magnificent Hospital Ship <br />equipped and maintained by the people of Madras, during the I World <br />War. This Hospital Ship created military history by plying <br />regularly between Africa and India, and subsequently between <br />Mesapotomia and India and rendering a splendid and much needed <br />medical service in those hectic and turbulent days. </p>
<p>Lord and Lady Pentland were deeply interested in Hindu Religion, <br />Hindu culture, Hindu mythology and Hindu philosophy.Lord Pentland <br />visited Rameshwaram in 1914 when Sir Alexander Tottenham (1873-1946) <br />was the District Collector of Ramanathapuram. Lord Pentland was so <br />overwhelmed by what he saw in Rameshwaram that he wrote as follows <br />to Lord Hardinge, the then Viceroy of India on 1st December <br />1914: `For me Rameshwaram, very much like India as a whole is the <br />real world. We English men live in a mad house of abstractions. <br />Vital life in Rameshwaram has not yet withdrawn into the capsule of <br />the head. It is the whole body that lives. No wonder the English man <br />feels dreamlike: the complete life of Rameshwaram is something of <br />which he merely dreams.... I did not see an English man in India who <br />really lived there. They are all living in England, that is, in a <br />sort of bottle filled with English air.... History can be events or <br />memory of events.... along the Bay of Bengal the Madras Presidency <br />runs, with the well-governed city of Madras at its center and the <br />sublime and glorious temples of Tanjore, Tiruchi, Madurai and <br />Rameshwaram adorning its Southern boundaries. And then Adam's Bridge-<br />a reef of sunken islands' beckons us across the Palk Straits to <br />Ceylon, where civilization flourished more than 2000 years <br />ago....Linga stones may be seen in many places on the highways in my <br />Presidency. Hindus break upon them the coconuts which they are about <br />to offer in sacrifice. Usually the phallic ritual is simple and <br />becoming; it consists in anointing the stone with consecrated water <br />or oil, and decorating it with leaves. At the Rameshwaram temple, <br />the Linga stone is daily washed with Ganga water, which is <br />afterwards sold to the pious, as holy water or mesmerized water has <br />been sold in Europe. All these are a little part of my beloved <br />Presidency - indeed my favourite India. Right from the dawn of <br />history, India is extraordinarily continuous in time. In space, on <br />the other hand, it is extraordinarily discontinuous. ... from early <br />times in India, it is ethnology, philology, and archaeology that <br />much can be expected. I would earnestly request you to direct the <br />Archaeological Survey of India (<acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym ) to undertake an extensive and <br />intensive survey of Rameshwaram and its beautiful environs, <br />particularly with reference to the historic and primordial Adam's <br />Bridge'. After 93 years and 60 years after our independence, this <br />very request of Lord Pentland made in 1914 for the conduct of an <br />intensive and extensive archeological survey of Rameswaram and Ram <br />Sethu by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  , was again reiterated by Dr Subramanian Swamy in <br />his letter sent to Mrs Ambika Soni, Union Minister for Culture on <br />March 3, 2007. This known anti-Hindu Christian Minister for Culture <br />(a political tenant- at –will totally at the mercy of Sonia Gandhi!) <br />treated Dr.Swami's reasonable request made in the larger public <br />interest with supreme-Sonia contempt and hatred.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Sir. Alexander Tottenham I.C.S. <br />( 1873-1946)<br />B Dewan of Pudukkottai <br />(1934-1946)</p>
<p>I got to know about Lord Pentland's letter of December 1914 <br />addressed to Lord Hardinge from my friend Late Shri.K.Nagarajan of <br />Pudukkottai. He was a great friend of Sir.Alexander Tottenham ICS <br />who was Dewan of Pudukkotttai from 1934 to 1946. Tottenham passed <br />away in Pudukkotai on December 13 1946. He lies buried in the <br />Lutheran Mission Churchyard at Machuvadi in Pudukkottai. As Dewan of <br />Pudukkottai, Tottenham became a legend as a great public servant—a <br />good man, noble,, just and generous. <br />Tottenham had given the excerpts from the letter of Lord Pentland <br />addressed to Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of India (already referred <br />to above) to Shri.K.Nagarajan and Shri.K.Nagarajan was good enough <br />to give me in December 1984, a copy of Sir.Alexander Tottenham's <br />letter dated 6th December 1941 addressed to Shri.K.Nagarajan. This <br />is a historic letter which speaks for itself. I am giving below a <br />facsimile of this letter of Sir.Alexander Tottenham dated 6th <br />December 1941.</p>
<p>Though Lord Pentland had recommended a Survey of the area in and <br />around Ram Sethu in December 1914 to Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of <br />India, yet no action was immediately taken by the Government of <br />India because of the intervention of the I World War Even after the <br />end of the I World War, nothing was done because the allocation of <br />funds for archeological work was substantially reduced during the <br />inter-war period between 1919 to 1939. The political turmoil created <br />by the rising independence movement in India also contributed to <br />this process. With the advent of II World War on September 3 1939, <br />all archeological survey work came to a standstill till 1945. This <br />position was clearly explained by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, Director <br />General of Archeology in 1946. </p>
<p>After our Independence, the Congress Government under Nehru <br />functioned as an Islamic anti-Hindu Government. The assassination of <br />Mahatma Gandhi on 30th January 1948, only strengthened the hands of <br />Congress Party to crush the spirit and culture of the Hindus of <br />India in a systematic manner. Nehru saw to it that the new <br />Constitution of India gave greater privileges and protection to the <br />anti-national Muslims of India who had just 1 year earlier in 1946 <br />voted enmasse for Muslim League and Pakistan. In a criminal <br />fashion, Nehru admitted the very same anti-national Muslim members <br />into the Congress Party, who had earlier voted for Jinnah and his <br />Pakistan. This `glorious' anti-Hindu tradition has reached its <br />climax under UPA Government today. The anti-national Sachar <br />Committee is an instance in point. Our surrogate Prime Minister is a <br />disposable pawn in the hands of a woman imposter from Italy who owes <br />no allegiance to the Indian State or the Indian Constitution. As a <br />known anti-Hindu Roman Catholic, she is acting as an active agent of <br />the Pope in Rome whose only programme is to evangelize India by <br />hook or by crook. Their larger hidden plan is to dismember India. It <br />is against this background, in these columns I had written as <br />follows in September 2007: `In my view, Union Shipping Minister TR <br />Baalu, Union Minister for Culture Ambika Soni, Tamil Nadu Chief <br />Minister Karunanidhi are all guilty of uttering unabashed falsehoods <br />when they say in unison, flanked and blessed by non-Hindu and anti-<br />Hindu Sonia Gandhi: `There is no credible or valid or tenable or <br />acceptable archeological or scientific evidence about the existence <br />of Ram Sethu Bridge'. Their deliberate falsehoods, individually or <br />collectively or severally, dished out in this context, not only come <br />into fierce conflict with historically established truths but also <br />raucously (if not `rationally' in the dastardly Dravidian sense!) <br />quarrel among themselves. Das Munshi, Union Minister for <br />Parliamentary Affairs, has squarely beaten the virulently anti-Hindu <br />trio of TR Baalu, Ambika Soni and Karunanidhi by declaring that Ram <br />Sethu Bridge would not be allowed to be destroyed during the UPA <br />rule like the Babri Masjid that was demolished when BJP was in power <br />in Uttar Pradesh in December 1992! More and more original fireworks <br />of similar diabolic duplicity and wickedness can be expected from <br />other anti-Hindu and Islam-embracing Union Ministers like Arjun <br />Singh, Antulay, Mani Shankar Iyer on this very exciting, excitable <br />and Congress-titillatin g `secular theme' of planned destruction of <br />Ram Sethu Bridge as an integral part of the Sethusamudram Shipping <br />Canal Project (SSCP)."</p>
<p>K.NAGARAJA IYER (1891-1986)</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I am indebted to Shri.K.Nagarajan for his <br />kindness in giving me a copy of Sir.Alexander Tottenham's letter to <br />me. K.Nagarajan was born on 20th June 1893. His father, Shri <br />A.G.Krishnaswamy Aiyar, was the Chief of the Pudukkottai State <br />Police Service. After graduating from Madras Christian College, he <br />joined the Madras Law College and completed his Bachelor of Law <br />course. After 2 years of legal practice in Madurai from 1913 to <br />1915, he settled down as a lawyer in Pudukkottai and continued in <br />his profession till his 82nd year in 1975. He was also State Vakil <br />and Public Prosecutor in Pudukkottai State. In 1980, the Department <br />of Archives of the Tamil Nadu Government, commissioned K.Nagarajan <br />to write a book on the life of Sir.Alexander Tottenham. He completed <br />this work and soon thereafter he passed away in the summer of 1986.</p>
<p>The historian is both discoverer and creator. To the uniqueness of <br />his role we have a clue in the very word `HISTORY', which means both <br />the course of the past and the legible account of the past. The <br />historian is always trying to reduce or remove, that ambiguity. If <br />he is successful, he leads his readers to take—or mistake—his <br />account for what was really there. Thus the historian sets himself a <br />dangerous, even an impossible, task. That is why, the great Dutch <br />historian, JH Huizinga used the phrase `A Wrestler with the Angel' <br />to describe a historian. The historian can rediscover the past only <br />by the relics it has left for the present. What his imagination is <br />to the poet, facts are to the historian. His exercise of judgement <br />comes in their selection, his art in their arrangement. His method <br />is narrative. His subject is the story of man's past. His function <br />is to make it known.</p>

He sat as Liberal member for Dumbartonshire and Forfarshire <BR in the House of Commons and acted asParliamentary Secretary to Sir <BR Henry Campbell Bannerman for many years.. He did outstanding War work <BR between 1914 and 1918 in the Presidency of Madras, ably assisted by <BR his public-spirited wife Lady Pentland. Both of them together raised <BR a large sum of money for building a magnificent Hospital Ship <BR equipped and maintained by the people of Madras, during the I World <BR War. This Hospital Ship created military history by plying <BR regularly between Africa and India, and subsequently between <BR Mesapotomia and India and rendering a splendid and much needed <BR medical service in those hectic and turbulent days. <BR <BR Lord and Lady Pentland weredeeply interested in Hindu Religion, <BR Hindu culture, Hindu<br />mythology and Hindu philosophy.Lord Pentland <BR visited Rameshwaram in 1914 when Sir Alexander Tottenham (1873-1946) <BR was the District Collector of Ramanathapuram. Lord Pentland was so <BR overwhelmed by what he saw in Rameshwaram that he wrote as follows <BR to Lord Hardinge, the then Viceroy of India on 1st December <BR 1914: `For me Rameshwaram, very much like India as a whole is the <BR real world. We English men live in a mad house of abstractions. <BR Vital life in Rameshwaram has not yet withdrawn into the capsule of <BR the head. It is the whole body that lives. No wonder the English man <BR feels dreamlike: the complete life of Rameshwaram is something of <BR which he merely dreams.... I did not see an English man in India who<BR really lived there. They are all living in England, that is, in a <BR sort of bottle filled with English air.... History can be events or <BR memory of events.... along the Bay of Bengal the Madras Presidency<br /><BR runs, with the well-governed city of Madras at its center and the <BR sublime and glorious temples of Tanjore, Tiruchi, Madurai and <BR Rameshwaram adorning its Southern boundaries. And then Adam's Bridge-<BR a reef of sunken islands' beckons us across the Palk Straits to <BR Ceylon, where civilization flourished more than 2000 years <BR ago....Linga stones may be seen in many places on the highways in my <BR Presidency. Hindus break upon them the coconuts which they are about <BR to offer in sacrifice. Usually thephallic ritual is simple and <BR becoming; it consists in anointing the stone with consecrated water <BR or oil, and decorating it with leaves. At the Rameshwaram temple, <BR the Linga stone is daily washed with Ganga water,which is <BR afterwards sold to the pious, as holy water or mesmerized water has <BR been sold in Europe. All these are a little part of my beloved <BR Presidency - indeed my favourite India. Right from the dawn of<br /><BR history, India is extraordinarily continuous in time. In space, on <BR the other hand, it is extraordinarily discontinuous. ... from early <BR times in India, it is ethnology, philology, and archaeology that <BR give andxpected. I would earnestly request you to direct the <BR Archaeological Survey of India (<acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym ) to undertake an extensive and <BR intensive survey of Rameshwaram and its beautiful environs, <BR particularly with reference to the historic and primordial Adam's <BR Bridge'. After 93 years and 60 years after our independence, this <BR very request of Lord Pentland made in 1914 for the conduct of an <BR intensive and extensive archeological survey of Rameswaram and Ram <BR Sethu by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  , was again reiterated by Dr Subramanian Swamy in <BR his letter sent to Mrs Ambika Soni, Union Minister for Culture on <BR March 3, 2007. This known anti-Hindu Christian Minister<br />for Culture <BR (a political tenant- at –will totally at the mercyof Sonia Gandhi!) <BR treated Dr.Swami's reasonable request made in the larger public <BR interest with supreme-Sonia contempt and hatred.<BR <BR Sir.. Alexander Tottenham I.C.S. <BR ( 1873-1946)<BR B Dewan of Pudukkottai <BR (1934-1946)<BR <BR I got to know about Lord Pentland's letter of December1914 <BR addressed to Lord Hardinge from my friend Late Shri.K.Nagarajan of <BR Pudukkottai. He was a great friend of Sir.Alexander Tottenham ICS <BR who was Dewan of Pudukkotttai from 1934 to 1946. Tottenham passed <BR awayin Pudukkotai on December 13 1946. He lies buried in the <BR Lutheran Mission Churchyard at Machuvadi in Pudukkottai. As Dewan of <BR Pudukkottai, Tottenham became a legend as a great public servant—a <BR good man, noble,, just and generous. <BR Tottenham had given the excerpts from the letter of Lord Pentland <BR addressed to Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of India<br />(already referred <BR to above) to Shri.K.Nagarajan and Shri.K.Nagarajan was good enough <BR to give me in December 1984, a copy of Sir.Alexander Tottenham's <BR letter dated 6th December 1941 addressed to Shri.K.Nagarajan. This <BR is a historic letter which speaks for itself. I am giving below a <BR facsimile of this letter of Sir.Alexander Tottenham dated 6th <BR December 1941.<BR <BR Though Lord Pentland had recommended a Survey of the area in and <BR around Ram Sethu in December 1914 to Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of <BR India, yet no action was immediately taken by the Government of <BR India because of the intervention of the I World War Even after the <BR endof the I World War, nothing was done because the allocation of <BR funds for archeological work was substantially reduced during the <BR inter-war period between 1919 to 1939. The political turmoil created <BR by the rising independence movement in India also contributed to <BR this process.<br />With the advent of II World War on September 3 1939, <BR all archeologicalsurvey work came to a standstill till 1945. This <BR position was clearly explained by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, Director <BR General of Archeology in 1946. <BR <BR After our Independence, the Congress Government under Nehru <BR functioned as an Islamic anti-Hindu Government. The assassination of <BR Mahatma Gandhi on 30th January 1948, only strengthened the hands of <BR Congress Party to crush the spirit and culture of the Hindus of <BR India in a systematic manner. Nehru saw to it that the new <BR Constitution of India gave greater privileges and protection to the <BR anti-national Muslims of India who had just 1 year earlier in 1946 <BR voted enmasse for Muslim League and Pakistan. In a criminal <BR fashion, Nehru admitted the very same anti-national Muslim members <BR into the Congress Party, who had earlier voted for Jinnah and his <BR Pakistan. This `glorious' anti-Hindu<br />tradition has reached its <BR climax under UPA Government today. The anti-national Sachar <BR Committee is an instance in point. Our surrogate Prime Minister is a <BR disposable pawn in the hands of a woman imposter from Italy who owes <BR no allegiance to the Indian State or the Indian Constitution. As a <BR known anti-Hindu Roman Catholic, she is acting as an active agent of <BR the Pope in Rome whose only programme is to evangelize India by <BR hook or by crook. Their larger hidden plan is to dismember India. It <BR is against this background, in these columns I had written as <BR follows in September 2007: `In my view, Union Shipping Minister TR <BR Baalu, UnionMinister for Culture Ambika Soni, Tamil Nadu Chief <BR Minister Karunanidhi are all guilty of uttering unabashed falsehoods <BR when they say in unison, flanked and blessed by non-Hindu and anti-<BR Hindu Sonia Gandhi: `There is no credible or valid or tenable or <BR acceptable archeological<br />or scientific evidence about the existence <BR of Ram Sethu Bridge'. Theirdeliberate falsehoods, individually or <BR collectively or severally, dished out in this context, not only come <BR into fierce conflict with historically established truths but also <BR raucously (if not `rationally' in thedastardly Dravidian sense!) <BR quarrel among themselves. Das Munshi, Union Minister for <BR Parliamentary Affairs, has squarely beaten the virulently anti-Hindu <BR trio of TR Baalu, Ambika Soni and Karunanidhi by declaringthat Ram <BR Sethu Bridge would not be allowed to be destroyed during the UPA <BR rule like the Babri Masjid that was demolished when BJP was in power <BR in Uttar Pradesh in December 1992! More and more original fireworks <BR of similar diabolic duplicity and wickedness can be expected from <BR other anti-Hindu and Islam-embracing Union Ministers like Arjun <BR Singh, Antulay, Mani Shankar Iyer on this very exciting, excitable <BR and<br />Congress-titillatin g `secular theme' of planned destruction of <BR Ram Sethu Bridge as an integral part of the Sethusamudram Shipping <BR Canal Project (SSCP)."<BR <BR K.NAGARAJA IYER (1891-1986)<BR <BR <BR As I mentioned earlier, I am indebted to Shri.K.Nagarajan for his <BR kindness in giving mea copy of Sir.Alexander Tottenham's letter to <BR me. K.Nagarajan was bornon 20th June 1893. His father, Shri <BR A.G.Krishnaswamy Aiyar, was the Chief of the Pudukkottai State <BR Police Service. After graduating from Madras Christian College, he <BR joined the Madras Law College and completed his Bachelor of Law <BR course. After 2 years of legal practice in Madurai from 1913 to <BR 1915, he settled down as a lawyer in Pudukkottai and continued in <BR his profession till his 82nd year in 1975. He was also State Vakil <BR and Public Prosecutor in Pudukkottai State. In 1980, the Department <BR of Archives of the Tamil Nadu Government, commissioned<br />K.Nagarajan <BR to write a book on the life of Sir.Alexander Tottenham. Hecompleted <BR this work and soon thereafter he passed away in the summer of 1986.<BR <BR The historian is both discoverer and creator. To the uniqueness of <BR his role we have a clue in the very word `HISTORY', which means both <BR the course of the past and the legible account of the past. The <BR historian is always trying to reduce or remove, that ambiguity. If <BR heis successful, he leads his readers to take—or mistake—his<BR account for what was really there. Thus the historian sets himself a <BR dangerous, even an impossible, task. That is why, the great Dutch <BR historian, JH Huizinga used the phrase `A Wrestler with the Angel' <BR to describe a historian. The historian can rediscover the past only <BR by the relics it has left for the present. What his imagination is <BR to the poet, facts are to the historian. His exercise of judgement <BR comes in their<br />selection, his art in their arrangement. His method <BR is narrative. His subject is the story of man's past. His function <BR is to make it known.<BR <BR (concluded)<BR <BR <BR <BR <BR <BR <BR </P </DIV </DIV </DIV </DIV <BR <br /><HR SIZE=1 <br />Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
