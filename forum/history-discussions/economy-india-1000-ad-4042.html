<p>Economy of india from 1000 AD</p>
<p>While we have made reasonable progress since independence, a <br />substantial part of our countrymen continue to live in poverty.</p>
<p>Indian Economy 1000 to 1300 a.d.</p>
<p>Agriculture was well cared after during this period. It appears that <br />scientific agriculture systems were followed. </p>
<p>The Cholas constructed a huge dam across the Caveri river, later <br />renovated by the British. </p>
<p>Fruits, cardamom, sandalwood, saffron, cotton, indigo etc were grown <br />in various parts of the country. <br />Manufacture of leather was greatly developed. </p>
<p>Pearl fisheries and ornaments were popular. Textiles business, stone <br />cutting, the art of working metals were very successful.</p>
<p>International trade was flourishing. Malabar was a sort of clearing <br />house between East and West. Broach and Sindh were important ports. <br />As in the past, industrial and commercial guilds played an important <br />part. <br />The condition of agriculture and trade indicate a high level of <br />prosperity prevailed at the beginning of this period. Marco Polo <br />described the land of Malabar as the best of all the Indies.</p>
<p>During his various invasions, Mahmud Ghazni drained India of enormous <br />wealth and manpower resources ( totally 60,098,300 dirhams ). He <br />plundered and looted every place that he conquered, the quantifiable <br />amounts being Somnath 20,000,000 , Kanuaj 20,000,000 , Mathura 98,300 <br />and Multan 20,000,000 dirhams.</p>
<p>Indian Economy 1300 to 1526 a.d.</p>
<p>The textile industry continued to flourish with Gujarat being the <br />largest exporter. Cotton and silk items from Cambay found their way <br />into Western Europe, South Africa, South-East Asia. </p>
<p>Bengal excelled in abundance and variety of its finer textiles. <br />Malabar was famous for its cotton fabrics. <br />Work in gold, silver, precious stones, ivory work was very popular in <br />Cambay, Vijayanagar and Malabar. <br />Inland trade was very activein orissa . There was a vibrant trade <br />with the Arab world and East Africa.</p>
<p>The Delhi Sultanate was amazingly affluent with extraordinary <br />splendor in the court of Muhammad bin Tughuluq. Immense bouty was <br />obtained by Malik Kafur from his devastating campaigns of South India <br />between 1309 and 1311.</p>
<p>Various accounts indicate that there was a wide diffusion of material <br />prosperity in the country with exceptional prosperity in Gujarat. <br />Vijayanagara in the South is described by a traveler as the best <br />provided city in the world. Bengal was prosperous too. The economic <br />prosperity of Delhi was shattered by the invasion of Timur in 1398.</p>
<p>Besides plundering the North, a historian very correctly said that <br />Timur had inflected more misery on India than ever had been inflicted <br />by any conqueror in a single invasion.</p>
<p>Economy 1526 to 1707 A.D.</p>
<p>The Indian economy was predominantly agricultural. "The country was <br />full of food and products," quoting Babur's memoirs. Cotton was <br />widely grown. In almost every village there were looms for <br />manufacturing cloth. Cotton cloth was exported to Burma, Arabia and <br />the east coast of Africa. Sericulture has been known in India from <br />remote ages. Silk pieces were exported to Indonesia, East Africa, <br />Philippines, Holland. Indigo was used for dying cloth and washing it <br />crystal white. It was grown in large parts of the country and <br />exported to Europe.</p>
<p>Sugarcane produced in Bengal was exported to Arabia and Persia. The <br />country had large forests cover because of which people used to take <br />shelter there after revolting. Akbar therefore, reclaimed forest land <br />for cultivation. The Dutch purchased large quantities of Gum Lac for <br />export to Persia. Ships were built for use by locals. Gold was found <br />in the Northern mountains. Diamond mines were found in Golconda. <br />India, particularly the Malabar region was rich in spices, one of the <br />reasons why the Portuguese tried to discover the sea route to our <br />country. Tobacco was unknown to India till the 16th century and was <br />brought to India by the Portuguese.</p>
<p>The nature of India's trade was the same as in earlier periods. <br />Amongst the largest items of export were Cotton and Pepper. She <br />traded with all of Asia and parts of Europe. Lahari Bandar was the <br />chief sea port in Sind from where cotton cloths were exported. Some <br />of the other ports were Cambay, Dabhol, Goa, Vizag, Hooghly, Calicut. <br />India maintained a balance of trade in her favor during the Mughal <br />age. </p>
<p>The quality of manufactured articles had improved during this period <br />and higher technical skill had diffused to some of the industrial <br />centers of the country. The artisans continued to produce stereotype <br />articles in their cottages. Net net India was in a state of overall <br />prosperity as has been articulated by various Muslim and Christian <br />visitors. Despite recurring famines they were confined to local <br />areas. However, during this period the average standard of living was <br />low. The condition of the masses was unsatisfactory, the fault lying <br />with faulty distribution and governmental extortion.</p>
<p>In their hearts the Mughal Emperors wanted to recapture their Central <br />Asian homeland. Their dream ended in 1647. Three futile sieges on <br />Quandhar ( for strategic importance) cost the Empire crores of <br />rupees. Having lost control over Afghanistan, the age long trade and <br />commerce between India and Persia/Central Asia suffered forcing <br />diversion of trade from the North to the sea ports of South India. <br />This was a source of great advantage of the Europeans but tremendous <br />loss to the Mughal treasury.</p>
<p>The ferocity and frequency of wars took its toll on the economic, <br />spiritual prosperity of the people. Regular conquest, reconquest, a <br />standing army cost money and eventually had to be funded by the <br />common man. At the time of Aurangzib's death peace and prosperity no <br />longer existed. The laboring populations suffered from violent <br />capture, forced labor and starvation but also from epidemics.</p>
<p>Economy 1708 to 1818 A.D.</p>
<p>A brief summary</p>
<p>The British conquest of India, starting 1757 compensated her for the <br />loss of her American colonies which till then had been a great supply <br />of cotton and foodgrains. With the technological inventions of 1760, <br />Britain created a capitalist class to take advantage of the new <br />inventions which led to the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>With the conquest of Bengal, the Company's servants edged out <br />competition and weavers were forced to deliver their goods at a price <br />decided by the company. The land revenue system was reorganized <br />giving Zamindars contracts for collection of revenue. Colossal <br />fortunes were made by the company's servants, mostly by unscrupulous <br />means. Since 1793, the condition of the agriculturists in Bengal <br />greatly deteriorated. ( one of the reasons the Marxists continue to <br />be in power in West Bengal for nearly 25 yrs is the far reaching land <br />reforms that they implemented in the state.)</p>
<p>In most of the South, the Ryotwari system was introduced where <br />settlement was made for a period of 20 to 30 yrs. As a result revenue <br />was pitched high initially and was periodically revised upward <br />squeezing the farmer. He had to borrow to pay revenue and when he <br />defaulted his land got sold. Thus made land a tradable commodity.</p>
<p>The Indian economy began to be modernized as a result of the British <br />conquest. On one hand it lead to the disintegration of the old social <br />order which provided security in times of need and scarcity and on <br />the other it increased hold of the foreign capitalist over the Indian <br />economy. With the state establishing direct contact with the farmer, <br />it dealt a great blow to age old village community and competition <br />took precedence over custom.</p>
<p>Mechanical and technological inventions in England began to <br />revolutionize the cotton industry starting 1760. The machinery could <br />not be used without the use of Capital. This came from the loot by <br />the Company servants in Bengal. Macaulay said " Treasure flowed to <br />England in oceans". This helped industry and agriculture for a credit <br />system based on Indian metal sprang up in England and farmers who <br />could borrow imported cattle.</p>
<p>Thus the foundation of England's economic prosperity was made <br />possible by the flow of Indian treasure and a ready made market for <br />goods produced in UK There may be a dispute regarding the degree of <br />India's contribution in the making of the Industrial Revolution but <br />none can deny India's contribution.</p>
<p>When the European merchants first arrived, the Indian traders served <br />as their brokers and cashiers lending them money. As time passed <br />these traders got ruined due to monopoly established by the English <br />company on the ordinary trade. Many merchants gave up trade and <br />acquired estates. Village communities began to disintegrate in the <br />18th century as a result of the increasing vogue of farming out <br />government revenues. For various reasons, a land less laborers, a <br />class of people, not altogether new to India, multiplied and came <br />into prominence.</p>
<p>The Portuguese carried out a profitable trade in slaves through the <br />16th and 17th centuries. Although traffic in slaves was banned in <br />1789, rural slavery continued. The 18th century saw a complete <br />revolution in the price structure. An intolerable increase in the <br />burden of revenue on agriculturists was the depreciation of the value <br />of , from 40 to 30 dams, silver in terms of copper as the revenue was <br />assessed in copper but paid in silver. This lead to an appreciation <br />of copper which was equal to a fall in the prices of agricultural <br />produce and a diminution of agricultural income measured in terms of <br />copper. Thus the farmer had to share more of his produce to pay <br />revenue and interest to creditors.</p>
<p>The Mughal practice of assigning jagirs to a host of civil/defense <br />officials instead of paying cash led to greater exploitation of the <br />peasant class. Taking advantage the British decided to debase the <br />coinage leading to a great loss to the population.</p>
<p>In the 16th and the 17th centuries, India was the magnet of the <br />world's precious metals. European nations had nothing of substance <br />except gold to give for all that they imported from India. By the end <br />of the 18th century, trade suffered a decline. Lack of peace was one <br />of the reasons. The Maratha system of exercising their supremacy over <br />provinces by extracting revenue without proper administration was <br />wasteful and expensive. Their armies destroyed whatever they could <br />not carry.</p>
<p>The Indian shipping industry was hit by the Portuguese, Dutch and <br />English in that order. While the Indian cotton industry was hit by <br />the ban on import of cotton into England, it lost hold over <br />traditional markets like Persia due to loss of naval power. By <br />imposition of various discriminatory duties, the ship building <br />industry was killed.</p>
<p>The economic decline of the country started around 1650. <br />Reduction/exemption of duties to the Brits and the Dutch was the <br />beginning. Import of printed calicos and silks was banned into <br />England in 1720. The English industry thrived on import of plain <br />Indian calicos. It was in 1799 that a duty of GBP 67-10-0 was imposed <br />on plain white clothes. The gradual rise in the prices of Indian <br />cotton towards the end of the 18th century deprived India of a <br />competitive advantage. The export of Indian silk and cotton to Europe <br />was around GBP 2.5 million ie beginning of 18th century. The import <br />of British cloth into India began to rise from about 1813.</p>
<p>Indigo was an important export item. There were about 400 factories <br />in Bengal and Bihar. And stuff worth GBP 3.6 million was exported. <br />But indigo cultivation led to great oppression of the cultivating <br />class by the Brits.</p>
<p>Every time a Indian ruler lost a war he was forced to pay the British <br />war expenses or buy peace. Where else did the money come from than <br />the ordinary man eg Shuja-ud-daulah paid the Brits Rs 50 lacs as war <br />exps for the Battle of Buxar. </p>
<p>Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries India maintained a favorable <br />balance of trade. Nadir Shah's invasion of 1738 shook the financial <br />and political set up of North India. Wealth accumulated during two <br />centuries of Mughal rule appr Rs 100 crs was lost in a months' time. </p>
<p>Economy 1818 to 1905 A. D.</p>
<p>The Charter Act of 1813 was a landmark in the Indian economy. It <br />abolished the East India company's monopoly over Indian trade and <br />opened India to the British traders, exposed her to the effects of <br />the Industrial revolution. The period saw the rise of the Managing <br />Agency System in India. It grew on the ruins of the agency houses, <br />that financed the earliest British capitalistic enterprise. Started <br />as family concerns eg Tatas they later on became pvt, public cos.</p>
<p>Some advantages of British Rule.( they came to india only for <br />business during their 400 years stay ,gradually accquired everything, <br />what ever they make it for their comfortable , side by helped us <br />also.but some unexceptional people really helped us . as per my <br />recent study so many manuscript and important tech. has teken by them.</p>
<p>Regular archaeological excavations beginning 1861, made the educated <br />Indians get a vivid picture of past glory of ancient India and <br />realize that India was on par with Rome and Greece. </p>
<p>The learning of English enabled the Indians to read about the strong <br />current of nationalistic ideas that passed through Europe and South <br />America during the 19th century. </p>
<p>Said Bal G Tilak " English education has imparted to us knowledge of <br />ancient and modern history. We have learnt how the Greeks, Romans <br />lost their patriotism etc. Only those who have learnt have begun to <br />realize the defects of British administration". Ability to <br />communicate in English has today, become a major advantage for the <br />Indians. </p>
<p>The Call Centre and medical transcription business have become <br />increasingly popular. Notice how comfortable was the Miss Universe, <br />Yukta Mookhey, speaking in English as compared to other participants. <br />White skinned people across the world seem baffled at our comfort <br />with the English language.</p>
<p>The printing press helped growth of vernacular literature, spread <br />education, connect India. Although not intended, the railways have <br />played an important part in uniting the country. </p>
<p>A train journey has become some sort of a melting pot. A berth of <br />four could have people from different parts of the country, each <br />sharing with the others, the beauty and uniqueness of the place that <br />he comes from. </p>
<p>Their importance can be judged by the fact that one of the reasons <br />being cited for the lack of integration of the North East and Kashmir <br />valley with the rest of India is the lack of an adequate rail network.</p>
<p>We have none but ourselves to blame for this current state. We have <br />adopted a system of governance that is alien to us, study English <br />literature that does not tell us about our culture, believe that <br />whatever happens in the West is good - should be aped by us, <br />continuously criticize our poverty without trying to understand why <br />we find ourselves in this situation today, refuse to take hard <br />decisions ? protect our national interest. </p>
<p>If India were a human being and went to a Psychologists for <br />treatment, the answer she would get is Lack of Self ? Esteem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our countrymen continue to use their intelligence to, <br />prevent things from happening, pull people down, score political <br />points, fraud the government. If only we learn to generate positive <br />vibrations, enjoy the success of others, love our country, India <br />would be a much better place to live in.</p>

<blockquote><p>  White skinned people across the world seem baffled at our comfort<br />  with the English language</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you trying to imply that english as a language is currently seen as that<br />of 'white' people? This for an instant gave me great elation, but soon as<br />realized this is as racist as it could get. Am sorry to say this, but if<br />'brown' people talking a language as that of 'white' people makes them any<br />better, the 'brown' people are demeaning themselves and the 'whites'.</p>
<p>Did you forget that *only* unified britain was the homeland of english until<br />a few centuries back? That the rest of the 'white' world was speaking<br />languages varying from french to spanish to dutch? why are you equating<br />english to 'white'?</p>
<p>Are you forgetting the spectacular english fluency of the many african<br />colonies?</p>
<p>Language is a common tool. Especially english is seen as a global business<br />language nowadays. Let us not try to flatter ourselves at speaking what the<br />'white' man did. Its more demeaning than appraising.</p>
<p>Sorry to have such strong counter views - I might seem the devil to strong<br />nationalists. I remember zig ziglar's audio in which he pooh poohs american<br />movies in which european americans are shown as broad minded in accomodating<br />african americans, and the african americans brimming with gratitude. Ziglar<br />says that the very act of showing the 'white's accomodating the 'black's is<br />discriminating. And I agree.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>
