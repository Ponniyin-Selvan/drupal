<p>*Was Lord Ram Really Born?*</p>
<p>We Indians are the products of one of the oldest civilisations. We need to<br />be really proud of our ancient history and cultural heritage. However,<br />during the British Rule, we developed an inferiority complex, which<br />adversely affected our quest to unearth facts relating to our glorious past.<br />But our young and educated men and women, born and brought up in independent<br />India, are capable of unearthing the true facts and are confident enough to<br />evaluate these objectively.</p>
<p>Shri Ram being most basic to Indian "ethos", it is necessary to know who is<br />Shri Ram? Was he really born? If yes, when and where? As is believed by<br />crores of people did he really put his feet on the Indian territory from<br />North to South, reducing the sufferings of mankind and ensuring victory of<br />good over evil? Let us take a look at historical facts:</p>
<p>The story of Shri Ram's life was first narrated by Maharishi Valmiki in the<br />Ramayana, which was written after Shri Ram was crowned as the king of<br />Ayodhya. Maharishi Valmiki was a great astronomer as he has made sequential<br />astronomical references on important dates related to the life of Shri Ram<br />indicating the location of planets vis-a-vis zodiac constellations and the<br />other stars (nakshatras). Needless to add that similar position of planets<br />and nakshatras is not repeated in thousands of years. By entering the<br />precise details of the planetary configuration of the important events in<br />the life of Shri Ram as given in the Valmiki Ramayan in the software named<br />"Planetarium" corresponding exact dates of these events according to the<br />English calendar can be known.</p>
<p>Mr Pushkar Bhatnagar of the Indian Revenue Service had acquired this<br />software from the US. It is used to predict the solar/lunar eclipses and<br />distance and location of other planets from earth. He entered the relevant<br />details about the planetary positions narrated by Maharishi Valmiki and<br />obtained very interesting and convincing results, which almost determine the<br />important dates starting from the birth of Shri Ram to the date of his<br />coming back to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.</p>
<p>Maharishi Valmiki has recorded in Bal Kaand sarga 19 and shloka eight and<br />nine (1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram was born on ninth tithi of Chaitra month when<br />the position of different planets vis-a-vis zodiac constellations and<br />nakshatras (visible stars) were: i) Sun in Aries; ii) Saturn in Libra; iii)<br />Jupiter in Cancer; iv) Venus in Pisces; v) Mars in Capricorn; vi) Lunar<br />month of Chaitra; vii) Ninth day after no moon; viii) Lagna as Cancer<br />(cancer was rising in the east); ix) Moon on the Punarvasu (Gemini<br />constellation &amp; Pllux star); x) Day time (around noon).</p>
<p>This data was fed into the software. The results indicated that this was<br />exactly the location of planets/stars in the noon of January 10, 5114 BC.<br />Thus Shri Ram was born on January 10, 5114 BC (7121 years back). As per the<br />Indian calendar it was the ninth day of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month and<br />the time was around 12 to 1 noontime. This is exactly the time and date when<br />Ram Navmi is celebrated all over India.</p>
<p>Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya. This fact can be ascertained from several<br />books written by Indian and foreign authors before and after the birth of<br />Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasa's Raghuvansam, Baudh and<br />Jain literature, etc. These books have narrated in great detail the<br />location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya which had many palaces and<br />temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was located on the banks of the<br />Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one side and Mithila on the<br />other side. Normally 7,000 years is a very long period during which<br />earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign invasions change the course of<br />rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alter the territories. Therefore,<br />the task of unearthing the facts is monumental. The present Ayodhya has<br />shrunk in size and the rivers have changed their course about 40 km<br />north/south.</p>
<p>Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya in his childhood (13th year as per Valmiki<br />Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwamitra who lived in Tapovan (Sidhhashram). From<br />there he went to Mithila, King Janaka's kingdom. Here he married Sita after<br />breaking Shiv Dhanusha. Researchers have gone along the route adopted by<br />Shri Ram as narrated in the Valmiki Ramayan and found 23 places which have<br />memorials that commemorate the events related to the life of Shri Ram. These<br />include Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhhashram, Gautamashram,<br />Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc. Memorials are built for great men<br />and not for fictitious characters.</p>
<p>Date of exile of Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayan's Ayodhya Kand<br />(2/4/18) that Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the king because Sun, Mars<br />and Rahu had surrounded his nakshatra and normally under such planetary<br />configuration the king dies or becomes a victim of conspiracies. Dashratha's<br />zodiac sign was Pisces and his nakshatra was Rewati. This planetary<br />configuration was prevailing on the January 5, 5089 BC, and it was on this<br />day that Shri Ram left Ayodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, he was 25 years<br />old at that time (5114-5089). There are several shlokas in Valmiki Ramayan<br />which indicate that Shri Ram was 25-years-old when he left Ayodhya for<br />exile.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayan refers to the solar eclipse at the time of war with<br />Khardushan in later half of 13th year of Shri Ram's exile. It is also<br />mentioned it was amavasya day and Mars was in the middle. When this data was<br />entered, the software indicated that there was a solar eclipse on October 7,<br />5077 BC, (amavasya day) which could be seen from Panchvati. The planetary<br />configuration was also the same - Mars was in the middle, on one side were<br />Venus and Mercury and on the other side were Sun and Saturn. On the basis of<br />planetary configurations described in various other chapters, the date on<br />which Ravana was killed works out to be December 4, 5076 BC, and Shri Ram<br />completed 14 years of exile on January 2, 5075 BC, and that day was also<br />Navami of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month. Thus Shri Ram had come back to<br />Ayodhya at the age of 39 (5114-5075).</p>
<p>A colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched on places visited by Shri Ram during<br />his exile, and sequentially moved to the places stated as visited by Shri<br />Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan, starting from Ayodhya he went right upto<br />Rameshwaram. He found 195 places which still have the memorials connected to<br />the events narrated in the Ramayana relating to the life of Shri Ram and<br />Sita. These include Tamsa Tal (Mandah), Shringverpur (Singraur), Bhardwaj<br />Ashram (situated near Allahabad), Atri Ashram, Markandaya Ashram (Markundi),<br />Chitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of Godavari), Panchvati, Sita Sarovar, Ram<br />Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nasik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkindha (village<br />Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Rameshwar temple.</p>
<p>In Valmiki Ramayan it is mentioned that Shri Ram's army constructed a bridge<br />over the sea between Rameshwaram and Lanka. After crossing this bridge, Shri<br />Ram's army had defeated Ravana. Recently, NASA put pictures on the Internet<br />of a man-made bridge, the ruins of which are lying submerged in Palk Strait<br />between Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka. Recently the Sri Lankan Government had<br />expressed the desire to develop Sita Vatika as a tourist spot. Sri Lankans<br />believe this was Ashok Vatika where Ravana had kept Sita as a prisoner (in<br />5076 BC).</p>
<p>Indian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the Suryavansh and he<br />was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other relevant particulars<br />of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written about 80 years<br />ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram. Professor Subhash Kak of Lousiana University,<br />in his book, The Astronomical Code of the Rig Veda, has also listed 63<br />ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayodhya. Sri Ram's ancestors have been<br />traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha, King Aja, King Raghu, King Dilip<br />everywhere people believe in the reality of Shri Ram's existence,<br />particularly in the tribal areas of Himachal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and<br />the North-East. Most of the festivals celebrated in these areas revolve<br />around the events in the life of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna.</p>
<p>The events and places related to the life of Shri Ram and Sita are true<br />cultural and social heritage of every Indian irrespective of caste and<br />creed. Therefore, it is common heritage. After all, Shri Ram belonged to the<br />period when Prophet Mohammed or Jesus Christ were not born and Muslim or<br />Christian faiths were unknown to the world. The words Hindu (resident of<br />Hindustan) and Indian (resident of India) were synonymous. India was also<br />known as Bharat (land of knowledge) and Aryavarta (where Aryans live) and<br />Hindustan (land of "Hindus" - derived from word Indus).</p>
<p>During Ram Rajya, the evils of caste system based on birth were<br />non-existent. In fact, Maharishi Valmiki is stated to be of shudra class<br />(scheduled caste), still Sita lived with him as his adopted daughter after<br />she was banished from Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his ashram as his<br />disciples. We need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki was perhaps the<br />first great astronomer and that his study of planetary configurations has<br />stood the test of times. Even the latest computer softwares have<br />corroborated his astronomical calculations, which proves that he did not<br />commit any error.</p>
<p>Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe. Shri Ram's army, which<br />succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by various tribals from Central<br />and South India. The facts, events and all other details relating to the<br />life of Shri Ram are the common heritage of all the Indians including<br />scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims, Christians, etc.</p>
<p>Prophet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ was born 2,000 years<br />back. Gautam Buddha was born 2,600 years back, whereas Ram was born 7,000<br />years back. Hence, discovering the details relating to Shri Ram's life would<br />be lot more difficult as destruction caused by floods, earthquakes and<br />invasions etc., would be far greater. But, should that stop our quest for<br />learning more about our cultural heritage?</p>
<p>As Indians, let us all take pride in the fact that the Indian civilisation<br />is the most ancient civilisation today. It is certainly more than 10,000<br />years old. Therefore, let us reject the story of Aryan invasion in India in<br />1,500 BC as motivated implantation. In fact Max Mueller, who was the creator<br />of this theory had himself rejected it. Let us admit that during the British<br />Rule, we were educated in the schools based on Macaulay school of thinking<br />which believed that everything Indian was inferior and that entire "Indian<br />literature was not worth even one book rack in England". If there were<br />similarities in certain features of Indian people and people from Central<br />Europe, then automatic inference drawn was that the Aryans coming from<br />Europe invaded India and settled here. No one dared of thinking in any other<br />way. Therefore, there is urgency for the historians and all other<br />intellectuals to stop reducing Indian history to myth. There is need to<br />gather, dig out, search, unearth and analyse all the evidences, which would<br />throw more light on ancient Indian civilisation and culture.</p>
<p>There is need for the print and the electronic media to take note of these<br />facts and create atmosphere which would motivate our young and educated<br />youth to carry out research and unearth true facts about the ancient Indian<br />civilisation and wisdom and would also encourage them to put across the<br />results of their research before the people fearlessly and with a sense of<br />pride!</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Rama navami in January?</p>
<p>- that is because of the precession of the equinox at the rate of 1<br />degree every 72 years (50.24 seconds per year).<br />That means, from the location in the backdrop of the zodiac where Sun<br />was sighted at the time of Rama's birth, it had regressed backwards<br />(anticlockwise in the zodiac)to January 10th for the same astro details.<br />when Ramavathara happened.</p>
<p>Assuming that Prof Bhatnagar's calculation is correct, the degrees<br />that are past can be roughly calculated like this.</p>
<p>Birth date on January 10th means Sun at 26 degrees in the<br />constellation of Sagittarius (Dhanus / Maargazhi)<br />The remaining degrees for January (maargazhi)= 4<br />For Thai = 30 degrees<br />For maasi = 30 degrees<br />For Panguni = 30 degrees <br />For Chitthirai = 10 degrees (for, Valimiki's narration indicates sun<br />at 10 degrees in Aries)<br />Added together it comes to 104 degrees.<br />This multiplied by 72 gives 7,488 years.<br />That is, Ramavathar happened approximately (approximately because I<br />have not taken into account the exact position in terms of degrees,<br />minutes and seconds)7488 years ago or around 5400 BC.</p>
<p>This is how the corresponding time in January in the present day time<br />is understood.</p>
<p>Here again there are bound to be minor variations in degrees, for,<br />precession has not been a constant at all times.</p>
<p>Science has no clues about it and has no ways and means to know how<br />it differed in the past.</p>
<p>But olden texts do give us indications of how the precession varied at<br />different times and the time periods where we have to apply corrections.</p>
<p>It is not known if Prof Bhatnagar has taken into account all that.</p>
<p>Another calculation given by Prof Vartak puts the date of Rama at Dec<br />4th, 7323 BC.</p>
<p>What is known from these is that Ramavathra happened in the measurable<br />time scale of Human living which is based on the 28,800 year cycle of<br />one complete revolution of the precession of the sun around the<br />zodiac. The basic unit of this time scale is 60 years (what we<br />commemorate as shashti aptha poorthy)in the Luni-solar calender of 5<br />rounds of the luni-solar years (5x12).</p>

        <p>SPS, yes and no. There are research based debates on whether Valmiki <br />was male or female (a'la tiruvalluvar although based on the story <br />telling one can conclude logically he is male), whether the Ramayana <br />itself is one contiguous story told by this person (even without <br />Uttara Kanda) since there is so much ambiguity in characters now and <br />then. </p>
<p>There is no conclusive evidence anywhere on anything. As far as what <br />I have read Paula Richman's research is very objective and does not <br />offend sentiments. She does mention that uttara kanda is <br />regarded 'edai cherugal' because Rama devotees have a difficult time <br />understanding his treatment of Sita as explained here. </p>

<p>    Swaroop, the uttara kanda does mention that Lava and Kusa inherit <br />  the <br />    throne after Sri Rama departs for the heavens. I guess being <br />twins <br />    they inherit it together. Also Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrugna <br />do <br />    have progeny and their own respective kingdoms. The detail of <br />    kingdoms is there (Lakshmana's capital was supposedly Lucknow of <br />  now, <br />    Shatrugna - Simla somwhere near kashmir, Bharata I don't <br />remember) <br />    but names of progeny etc not so.</p>
<p>    The Ramayana does not end like the Mahabharat with the end of the <br />    yuga, only with Sri rama and sita going back to their abodes. It <br />    would be interesting to know what happened after.</p>

<p>          *Was Lord Ram Really Born?*</p>
<p>          We Indians are the products of one of the oldest <br />civilisations.<br />      We need to<br />          be really proud of our ancient history and cultural <br />heritage.<br />      However,<br />          during the British Rule, we developed an inferiority <br />complex,<br />      which<br />          adversely affected our quest to unearth facts relating to <br />our<br />      glorious past.<br />          But our young and educated men and women, born and brought <br />up<br />    in<br />      independent<br />          India, are capable of unearthing the true facts and are<br />    confident<br />      enough to<br />          evaluate these objectively.</p>
<p>          Shri Ram being most basic to Indian "ethos", it is <br />necessary to<br />      know who is<br />          Shri Ram? Was he really born? If yes, when and where? As is<br />      believed by<br />          crores of people did he really put his feet on the Indian<br />      territory from<br />          North to South, reducing the sufferings of mankind and <br />ensuring<br />      victory of<br />          good over evil? Let us take a look at historical facts:</p>
<p>          The story of Shri Ram's life was first narrated by Maharishi<br />      Valmiki in the<br />          Ramayana, which was written after Shri Ram was crowned as <br />the<br />      king of<br />          Ayodhya. Maharishi Valmiki was a great astronomer as he has<br />    made<br />      sequential<br />          astronomical references on important dates related to the <br />life<br />    of<br />      Shri Ram<br />          indicating the location of planets vis-a-vis zodiac<br />      constellations and the<br />          other stars (nakshatras). Needless to add that similar <br />position<br />      of planets<br />          and nakshatras is not repeated in thousands of years. By<br />    entering<br />      the<br />          precise details of the planetary configuration of the <br />important<br />      events in<br />          the life of Shri Ram as given in the Valmiki Ramayan in the<br />      software named<br />          "Planetarium" corresponding exact dates of these events<br />    according<br />      to the<br />          English calendar can be known.</p>
<p>          Mr Pushkar Bhatnagar of the Indian Revenue Service had <br />acquired<br />      this<br />          software from the US. It is used to predict the solar/lunar<br />      eclipses and<br />          distance and location of other planets from earth. He <br />entered<br />    the<br />      relevant<br />          details about the planetary positions narrated by Maharishi<br />      Valmiki and<br />          obtained very interesting and convincing results, which <br />almost<br />      determine the<br />          important dates starting from the birth of Shri Ram to the <br />date<br />      of his<br />          coming back to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.</p>
<p>          Maharishi Valmiki has recorded in Bal Kaand sarga 19 and <br />shloka<br />      eight and<br />          nine (1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram was born on ninth tithi of<br />    Chaitra<br />      month when<br />          the position of different planets vis-a-vis zodiac<br />    constellations<br />      and<br />          nakshatras (visible stars) were: i) Sun in Aries; ii) <br />Saturn in<br />      Libra; iii)<br />          Jupiter in Cancer; iv) Venus in Pisces; v) Mars in <br />Capricorn;     vi)<br />      Lunar<br />          month of Chaitra; vii) Ninth day after no moon; viii) Lagna <br />as<br />      Cancer<br />          (cancer was rising in the east); ix) Moon on the Punarvasu<br />    (Gemini<br />          constellation &amp; Pllux star); x) Day time (around noon).</p>
<p>          This data was fed into the software. The results indicated <br />that<br />      this was<br />          exactly the location of planets/stars in the noon of January<br />    10,<br />      5114 BC.<br />          Thus Shri Ram was born on January 10, 5114 BC (7121 years<br />    back).<br />      As per the<br />          Indian calendar it was the ninth day of Shukla Paksha in<br />    Chaitra<br />      month and<br />          the time was around 12 to 1 noontime. This is exactly the <br />time<br />      and date when<br />          Ram Navmi is celebrated all over India.</p>
<p>          Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya. This fact can be ascertained <br />from<br />      several<br />          books written by Indian and foreign authors before and after<br />    the<br />      birth of<br />          Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasa's<br />    Raghuvansam,<br />      Baudh and<br />          Jain literature, etc. These books have narrated in great <br />detail<br />      the<br />          location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya which had<br />    many<br />      palaces and<br />          temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was located on <br />the<br />      banks of the<br />          Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one side and<br />      Mithila on the<br />          other side. Normally 7,000 years is a very long period <br />during<br />      which<br />          earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign invasions change the<br />      course of<br />          rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alter the <br />territories.<br />      Therefore,<br />          the task of unearthing the facts is monumental. The present<br />      Ayodhya has<br />          shrunk in size and the rivers have changed their course <br />about<br />    40<br />      km<br />          north/south.</p>
<p>          Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya in his childhood (13th year as <br />per<br />      Valmiki<br />          Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwamitra who lived in Tapovan<br />      (Sidhhashram). From<br />          there he went to Mithila, King Janaka's kingdom. Here he<br />    married<br />      Sita after<br />          breaking Shiv Dhanusha. Researchers have gone along the <br />route<br />      adopted by<br />          Shri Ram as narrated in the Valmiki Ramayan and found 23 <br />places<br />      which have<br />          memorials that commemorate the events related to the life of<br />    Shri<br />      Ram. These<br />          include Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhhashram,<br />      Gautamashram,<br />          Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc. Memorials are built<br />    for<br />      great men<br />          and not for fictitious characters.</p>
<p>          Date of exile of Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki <br />Ramayan's<br />      Ayodhya<br />          Kand (2/4/18) that Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the <br />king<br />      because Sun,<br />          Mars and Rahu had surrounded his nakshatra and normally <br />under<br />      such planetary<br />          configuration the king dies or becomes a victim of<br />    conspiracies.<br />      Dashratha's<br />          zodiac sign was Pisces and his nakshatra was Rewati. This<br />      planetary<br />          configuration was prevailing on the January 5, 5089 BC, and <br />it<br />      was on this<br />          day that Shri Ram left Ayodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, <br />he<br />      was 25 years<br />          old at that time (5114-5089). There are several shlokas in<br />      Valmiki Ramayan<br />          which indicate that Shri Ram was 25-years-old when he left<br />      Ayodhya for<br />          exile.</p>
<p>          Valmiki Ramayan refers to the solar eclipse at the time of <br />war<br />      with<br />          Khardushan in later half of 13th year of Shri Ram's exile. <br />It<br />    is<br />      also<br />          mentioned it was amavasya day and Mars was in the middle. <br />When<br />      this data was<br />          entered, the software indicated that there was a solar <br />eclipse<br />    on<br />      October 7,<br />          5077 BC, (amavasya day) which could be seen from Panchvati. <br />The<br />      planetary<br />          configuration was also the same - Mars was in the middle, on<br />    one<br />      side were<br />          Venus and Mercury and on the other side were Sun and <br />Saturn. On<br />      the basis of<br />          planetary configurations described in various other <br />chapters,<br />    the<br />      date on<br />          which Ravana was killed works out to be December 4, 5076 BC,<br />    and<br />      Shri Ram<br />          completed 14 years of exile on January 2, 5075 BC, and that <br />day<br />      was also<br />          Navami of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month. Thus Shri Ram had<br />    come<br />      back to<br />          Ayodhya at the age of 39 (5114-5075).</p>
<p>          A colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched on places visited by <br />Shri<br />      Ram during<br />          his exile, and sequentially moved to the places stated as<br />    visited<br />      by Shri<br />          Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan, starting from Ayodhya he went <br />right<br />      upto<br />          Rameshwaram. He found 195 places which still have the <br />memorials<br />      connected to<br />          the events narrated in the Ramayana relating to the life of<br />    Shri<br />      Ram and<br />          Sita. These include Tamsa Tal (Mandah), Shringverpur<br />    (Singraur),<br />      Bhardwaj<br />          Ashram (situated near Allahabad), Atri Ashram, Markandaya<br />    Ashram<br />      (Markundi),<br />          Chitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of Godavari), Panchvati, Sita<br />      Sarovar, Ram<br />          Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nasik, Shabari Ashram, <br />Kishkindha<br />      (village<br />          Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Rameshwar temple.</p>
<p>          In Valmiki Ramayan it is mentioned that Shri Ram's army<br />      constructed a<br />          bridge over the sea between Rameshwaram and Lanka. After<br />    crossing<br />      this<br />          bridge, Shri Ram's army had defeated Ravana. Recently, NASA <br />put<br />      pictures on<br />          the Internet of a man-made bridge, the ruins of which are <br />lying<br />      submerged in<br />          Palk Strait between Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka. Recently the <br />Sri<br />      Lankan<br />          Government had expressed the desire to develop Sita Vatika <br />as a<br />      tourist<br />          spot. Sri Lankans believe this was Ashok Vatika where Ravana<br />    had<br />      kept Sita<br />          as a prisoner (in 5076 BC).</p>
<p>          Indian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the<br />      Suryavansh and he<br />          was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other<br />    relevant<br />      particulars<br />          of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written<br />      about 80 years<br />          ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram. Professor Subhash Kak of <br />Lousiana<br />      University,<br />          in his book, The Astronomical Code of the Rig Veda, has also<br />      listed 63<br />          ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayodhya. Sri Ram's<br />    ancestors<br />      have been<br />          traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha, King Aja, King <br />Raghu,<br />      King Dilip<br />    Gujarat,<br />          everywhere people believe in the reality of Shri Ram's<br />    existence,<br />          particularly in the tribal areas of Himachal, Rajasthan, <br />Madhya<br />      Pradesh and<br />          the North-East. Most of the festivals celebrated in these <br />areas<br />      revolve<br />          around the events in the life of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna.</p>
<p>          The events and places related to the life of Shri Ram and <br />Sita<br />      are true<br />          cultural and social heritage of every Indian irrespective of<br />      caste and<br />          creed. Therefore, it is common heritage. After all, Shri Ram<br />      belonged to the<br />          period when Prophet Mohammed or Jesus Christ were not born <br />and<br />      Muslim or<br />          Christian faiths were unknown to the world. The words Hindu<br />      (resident of<br />          Hindustan) and Indian (resident of India) were synonymous.<br />    India<br />      was also<br />          known as Bharat (land of knowledge) and Aryavarta (where <br />Aryans<br />      live) and<br />          Hindustan (land of "Hindus" - derived from word Indus).</p>
<p>          During Ram Rajya, the evils of caste system based on birth <br />were<br />          non-existent. In fact, Maharishi Valmiki is stated to be of<br />      shudra class<br />          (scheduled caste), still Sita lived with him as his adopted<br />      daughter after<br />          she was banished from Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his <br />ashram<br />    as<br />      his<br />          disciples. We need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki was<br />      perhaps the<br />          first great astronomer and that his study of planetary<br />      configurations has<br />          stood the test of times. Even the latest computer softwares <br />have<br />          corroborated his astronomical calculations, which proves <br />that<br />    he<br />      did not<br />          commit any error.</p>
<p>          Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe. Shri<br />    Ram's<br />      army,<br />          which succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by various<br />      tribals from<br />          Central and South India. The facts, events and all other<br />    details<br />      relating to<br />          the life of Shri Ram are the common heritage of all the <br />Indians<br />      including<br />          scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims, Christians, <br />etc.</p>
<p>          Prophet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ was<br />    born<br />      2,000<br />          years back. Gautam Buddha was born 2,600 years back, whereas<br />    Ram<br />      was born<br />          7,000 years back. Hence, discovering the details relating to<br />    Shri<br />      Ram's life<br />          would be lot more difficult as destruction caused by floods,<br />      earthquakes and<br />          invasions etc., would be far greater. But, should that stop <br />our<br />      quest for<br />          learning more about our cultural heritage?</p>
<p>          As Indians, let us all take pride in the fact that the <br />Indian<br />      civilisation<br />          is the most ancient civilisation today. It is certainly more<br />    than<br />      10,000<br />          years old. Therefore, let us reject the story of Aryan <br />invasion<br />      in India in<br />          1,500 BC as motivated implantation. In fact Max Mueller, who<br />    was<br />      the creator<br />          of this theory had himself rejected it. Let us admit that<br />    during<br />      the British<br />          Rule, we were educated in the schools based on Macaulay <br />school<br />    of<br />      thinking<br />          which believed that everything Indian was inferior and that<br />      entire "Indian<br />          literature was not worth even one book rack in England". If<br />    there<br />      were<br />          similarities in certain features of Indian people and people<br />    from<br />      Central<br />          Europe, then automatic inference drawn was that the Aryans<br />    coming<br />      from<br />          Europe invaded India and settled here. No one dared of <br />thinking<br />      in any other<br />          way. Therefore, there is urgency for the historians and all<br />    other<br />          intellectuals to stop reducing Indian history to myth. <br />There is<br />      need to<br />          gather, dig out, search, unearth and analyse all the <br />evidences,<br />      which would<br />          throw more light on ancient Indian civilisation and culture.</p>
<p>          There is need for the print and the electronic media to take<br />    note<br />      of these<br />          facts and create atmosphere which would motivate our young <br />and<br />      educated<br />          youth to carry out research and unearth true facts about the<br />      ancient Indian<br />          civilisation and wisdom and would also encourage them to put<br />      across the<br />          results of their research before the people fearlessly and <br />with<br />    a<br />      sense of<br />          pride!</p>

<p>          There is no need of great austerities or penances to worship<br />    Lord<br />          Ramacandra, for He accepts even a small service offered by <br />His<br />      devotee. Thus<br />          He is satisfied and as soon as He is satisfied, the devotee <br />is<br />      successful.<br />          Indeed, Lord Sri Ramacandra brought all the devotees of <br />Ayodhya<br />      back home,<br />          back to Godhead.

<p>Am sure we will get links from Vijaypedia too !</p>
<p>And ever-enthusiastic Kalingatamil Balu has also posted certain <br />detail ...</p>
<p>Re RAM and KRISHNA .. the Epics are based on certain Personalities - <br />believed to have lived and performed.. in Ancient times .. (hence <br />Puranic)... and Science is looking into these aspects ..</p>

<p>        *Was Lord Ram Really Born?*</p>
<p>        We Indians are the products of one of the oldest civilisations.<br />    We need to<br />        be really proud of our ancient history and cultural heritage.<br />    However,<br />        during the British Rule, we developed an inferiority complex,<br />    which<br />        adversely affected our quest to unearth facts relating to our<br />    glorious past.<br />        But our young and educated men and women, born and brought up<br />  in<br />    independent<br />        India, are capable of unearthing the true facts and are<br />  confident<br />    enough to<br />        evaluate these objectively.</p>
<p>        Shri Ram being most basic to Indian "ethos", it is necessary to<br />    know who is<br />        Shri Ram? Was he really born? If yes, when and where? As is<br />    believed by<br />        crores of people did he really put his feet on the Indian<br />    territory from<br />        North to South, reducing the sufferings of mankind and ensuring<br />    victory of<br />        good over evil? Let us take a look at historical facts:</p>
<p>        The story of Shri Ram's life was first narrated by Maharishi<br />    Valmiki in the<br />        Ramayana, which was written after Shri Ram was crowned as the<br />    king of<br />        Ayodhya. Maharishi Valmiki was a great astronomer as he has<br />  made<br />    sequential<br />        astronomical references on important dates related to the life<br />  of<br />    Shri Ram<br />        indicating the location of planets vis-a-vis zodiac<br />    constellations and the<br />        other stars (nakshatras). Needless to add that similar position<br />    of planets<br />        and nakshatras is not repeated in thousands of years. By<br />  entering<br />    the<br />        precise details of the planetary configuration of the important<br />    events in<br />        the life of Shri Ram as given in the Valmiki Ramayan in the<br />    software named<br />        "Planetarium" corresponding exact dates of these events<br />  according<br />    to the<br />        English calendar can be known.</p>
<p>        Mr Pushkar Bhatnagar of the Indian Revenue Service had acquired<br />    this<br />        software from the US. It is used to predict the solar/lunar<br />    eclipses and<br />        distance and location of other planets from earth. He entered<br />  the<br />    relevant<br />        details about the planetary positions narrated by Maharishi<br />    Valmiki and<br />        obtained very interesting and convincing results, which almost<br />    determine the<br />        important dates starting from the birth of Shri Ram to the date<br />    of his<br />        coming back to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.</p>
<p>        Maharishi Valmiki has recorded in Bal Kaand sarga 19 and shloka<br />    eight and<br />        nine (1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram was born on ninth tithi of<br />  Chaitra<br />    month when<br />        the position of different planets vis-a-vis zodiac<br />  constellations<br />    and<br />        nakshatras (visible stars) were: i) Sun in Aries; ii) Saturn in<br />    Libra; iii)<br />        Jupiter in Cancer; iv) Venus in Pisces; v) Mars in Capricorn;   vi)<br />    Lunar<br />        month of Chaitra; vii) Ninth day after no moon; viii) Lagna as<br />    Cancer<br />        (cancer was rising in the east); ix) Moon on the Punarvasu<br />  (Gemini<br />        constellation &amp; Pllux star); x) Day time (around noon).</p>
<p>        This data was fed into the software. The results indicated that<br />    this was<br />        exactly the location of planets/stars in the noon of January<br />  10,<br />    5114 BC.<br />        Thus Shri Ram was born on January 10, 5114 BC (7121 years<br />  back).<br />    As per the<br />        Indian calendar it was the ninth day of Shukla Paksha in<br />  Chaitra<br />    month and<br />        the time was around 12 to 1 noontime. This is exactly the time<br />    and date when<br />        Ram Navmi is celebrated all over India.</p>
<p>        Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya. This fact can be ascertained from<br />    several<br />        books written by Indian and foreign authors before and after<br />  the<br />    birth of<br />        Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasa's<br />  Raghuvansam,<br />    Baudh and<br />        Jain literature, etc. These books have narrated in great detail<br />    the<br />        location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya which had<br />  many<br />    palaces and<br />        temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was located on the<br />    banks of the<br />        Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one side and<br />    Mithila on the<br />        other side. Normally 7,000 years is a very long period during<br />    which<br />        earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign invasions change the<br />    course of<br />        rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alter the territories.<br />    Therefore,<br />        the task of unearthing the facts is monumental. The present<br />    Ayodhya has<br />        shrunk in size and the rivers have changed their course about<br />  40<br />    km<br />        north/south.</p>
<p>        Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya in his childhood (13th year as per<br />    Valmiki<br />        Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwamitra who lived in Tapovan<br />    (Sidhhashram). From<br />        there he went to Mithila, King Janaka's kingdom. Here he<br />  married<br />    Sita after<br />        breaking Shiv Dhanusha. Researchers have gone along the route<br />    adopted by<br />        Shri Ram as narrated in the Valmiki Ramayan and found 23 places<br />    which have<br />        memorials that commemorate the events related to the life of<br />  Shri<br />    Ram. These<br />        include Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhhashram,<br />    Gautamashram,<br />        Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc. Memorials are built<br />  for<br />    great men<br />        and not for fictitious characters.</p>
<p>        Date of exile of Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayan's<br />    Ayodhya<br />        Kand (2/4/18) that Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the king<br />    because Sun,<br />        Mars and Rahu had surrounded his nakshatra and normally under<br />    such planetary<br />        configuration the king dies or becomes a victim of<br />  conspiracies.<br />    Dashratha's<br />        zodiac sign was Pisces and his nakshatra was Rewati. This<br />    planetary<br />        configuration was prevailing on the January 5, 5089 BC, and it<br />    was on this<br />        day that Shri Ram left Ayodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, he<br />    was 25 years<br />        old at that time (5114-5089). There are several shlokas in<br />    Valmiki Ramayan<br />        which indicate that Shri Ram was 25-years-old when he left<br />    Ayodhya for<br />        exile.</p>
<p>        Valmiki Ramayan refers to the solar eclipse at the time of war<br />    with<br />        Khardushan in later half of 13th year of Shri Ram's exile. It<br />  is<br />    also<br />        mentioned it was amavasya day and Mars was in the middle. When<br />    this data was<br />        entered, the software indicated that there was a solar eclipse<br />  on<br />    October 7,<br />        5077 BC, (amavasya day) which could be seen from Panchvati. The<br />    planetary<br />        configuration was also the same - Mars was in the middle, on<br />  one<br />    side were<br />        Venus and Mercury and on the other side were Sun and Saturn. On<br />    the basis of<br />        planetary configurations described in various other chapters,<br />  the<br />    date on<br />        which Ravana was killed works out to be December 4, 5076 BC,<br />  and<br />    Shri Ram<br />        completed 14 years of exile on January 2, 5075 BC, and that day<br />    was also<br />        Navami of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month. Thus Shri Ram had<br />  come<br />    back to<br />        Ayodhya at the age of 39 (5114-5075).</p>
<p>        A colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched on places visited by Shri<br />    Ram during<br />        his exile, and sequentially moved to the places stated as<br />  visited<br />    by Shri<br />        Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan, starting from Ayodhya he went right<br />    upto<br />        Rameshwaram. He found 195 places which still have the memorials<br />    connected to<br />        the events narrated in the Ramayana relating to the life of<br />  Shri<br />    Ram and<br />        Sita. These include Tamsa Tal (Mandah), Shringverpur<br />  (Singraur),<br />    Bhardwaj<br />        Ashram (situated near Allahabad), Atri Ashram, Markandaya<br />  Ashram<br />    (Markundi),<br />        Chitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of Godavari), Panchvati, Sita<br />    Sarovar, Ram<br />        Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nasik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkindha<br />    (village<br />        Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Rameshwar temple.</p>
<p>        In Valmiki Ramayan it is mentioned that Shri Ram's army<br />    constructed a<br />        bridge over the sea between Rameshwaram and Lanka. After<br />  crossing<br />    this<br />        bridge, Shri Ram's army had defeated Ravana. Recently, NASA put<br />    pictures on<br />        the Internet of a man-made bridge, the ruins of which are lying<br />    submerged in<br />        Palk Strait between Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka. Recently the Sri<br />    Lankan<br />        Government had expressed the desire to develop Sita Vatika as a<br />    tourist<br />        spot. Sri Lankans believe this was Ashok Vatika where Ravana<br />  had<br />    kept Sita<br />        as a prisoner (in 5076 BC).</p>
<p>        Indian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the<br />    Suryavansh and he<br />        was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other<br />  relevant<br />    particulars<br />        of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written<br />    about 80 years<br />        ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram. Professor Subhash Kak of Lousiana<br />    University,<br />        in his book, The Astronomical Code of the Rig Veda, has also<br />    listed 63<br />        ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayodhya. Sri Ram's<br />  ancestors<br />    have been<br />        traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha, King Aja, King Raghu,<br />    King Dilip<br />  Gujarat,<br />        everywhere people believe in the reality of Shri Ram's<br />  existence,<br />        particularly in the tribal areas of Himachal, Rajasthan, Madhya<br />    Pradesh and<br />        the North-East. Most of the festivals celebrated in these areas<br />    revolve<br />        around the events in the life of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna.</p>
<p>        The events and places related to the life of Shri Ram and Sita<br />    are true<br />        cultural and social heritage of every Indian irrespective of<br />    caste and<br />        creed. Therefore, it is common heritage. After all, Shri Ram<br />    belonged to the<br />        period when Prophet Mohammed or Jesus Christ were not born and<br />    Muslim or<br />        Christian faiths were unknown to the world. The words Hindu<br />    (resident of<br />        Hindustan) and Indian (resident of India) were synonymous.<br />  India<br />    was also<br />        known as Bharat (land of knowledge) and Aryavarta (where Aryans<br />    live) and<br />        Hindustan (land of "Hindus" - derived from word Indus).</p>
<p>        During Ram Rajya, the evils of caste system based on birth were<br />        non-existent. In fact, Maharishi Valmiki is stated to be of<br />    shudra class<br />        (scheduled caste), still Sita lived with him as his adopted<br />    daughter after<br />        she was banished from Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his ashram<br />  as<br />    his<br />        disciples. We need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki was<br />    perhaps the<br />        first great astronomer and that his study of planetary<br />    configurations has<br />        stood the test of times. Even the latest computer softwares have<br />        corroborated his astronomical calculations, which proves that<br />  he<br />    did not<br />        commit any error.</p>
<p>        Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe. Shri<br />  Ram's<br />    army,<br />        which succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by various<br />    tribals from<br />        Central and South India. The facts, events and all other<br />  details<br />    relating to<br />        the life of Shri Ram are the common heritage of all the Indians<br />    including<br />        scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims, Christians, etc.</p>
<p>        Prophet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ was<br />  born<br />    2,000<br />        years back. Gautam Buddha was born 2,600 years back, whereas<br />  Ram<br />    was born<br />        7,000 years back. Hence, discovering the details relating to<br />  Shri<br />    Ram's life<br />        would be lot more difficult as destruction caused by floods,<br />    earthquakes and<br />        invasions etc., would be far greater. But, should that stop our<br />    quest for<br />        learning more about our cultural heritage?</p>
<p>        As Indians, let us all take pride in the fact that the Indian<br />    civilisation<br />        is the most ancient civilisation today. It is certainly more<br />  than<br />    10,000<br />        years old. Therefore, let us reject the story of Aryan invasion<br />    in India in<br />        1,500 BC as motivated implantation. In fact Max Mueller, who<br />  was<br />    the creator<br />        of this theory had himself rejected it. Let us admit that<br />  during<br />    the British<br />        Rule, we were educated in the schools based on Macaulay school<br />  of<br />    thinking<br />        which believed that everything Indian was inferior and that<br />    entire "Indian<br />        literature was not worth even one book rack in England". If<br />  there<br />    were<br />        similarities in certain features of Indian people and people<br />  from<br />    Central<br />        Europe, then automatic inference drawn was that the Aryans<br />  coming<br />    from<br />        Europe invaded India and settled here. No one dared of thinking<br />    in any other<br />        way. Therefore, there is urgency for the historians and all<br />  other<br />        intellectuals to stop reducing Indian history to myth. There is<br />    need to<br />        gather, dig out, search, unearth and analyse all the evidences,<br />    which would<br />        throw more light on ancient Indian civilisation and culture.</p>
<p>        There is need for the print and the electronic media to take<br />  note<br />    of these<br />        facts and create atmosphere which would motivate our young and<br />    educated<br />        youth to carry out research and unearth true facts about the<br />    ancient Indian<br />        civilisation and wisdom and would also encourage them to put<br />    across the<br />        results of their research before the people fearlessly and with<br />  a<br />    sense of<br />        pride!</p>

<p>        There is no need of great austerities or penances to worship<br />  Lord<br />        Ramacandra, for He accepts even a small service offered by His<br />    devotee. Thus<br />        He is satisfied and as soon as He is satisfied, the devotee is<br />    successful.<br />        Indeed, Lord Sri Ramacandra brought all the devotees of Ayodhya<br />    back home,<br />        back to Godhead.

<p>      *Was Lord Ram Really Born?*</p>
<p>      We Indians are the products of one of the oldest civilisations. <br />  We need to<br />      be really proud of our ancient history and cultural heritage. <br />  However,<br />      during the British Rule, we developed an inferiority complex, <br />  which<br />      adversely affected our quest to unearth facts relating to our <br />  glorious past.<br />      But our young and educated men and women, born and brought up <br />in <br />  independent<br />      India, are capable of unearthing the true facts and are <br />confident <br />  enough to<br />      evaluate these objectively.</p>
<p>      Shri Ram being most basic to Indian "ethos", it is necessary to <br />  know who is<br />      Shri Ram? Was he really born? If yes, when and where? As is <br />  believed by<br />      crores of people did he really put his feet on the Indian <br />  territory from<br />      North to South, reducing the sufferings of mankind and ensuring <br />  victory of<br />      good over evil? Let us take a look at historical facts:</p>
<p>      The story of Shri Ram's life was first narrated by Maharishi <br />  Valmiki in the<br />      Ramayana, which was written after Shri Ram was crowned as the <br />  king of<br />      Ayodhya. Maharishi Valmiki was a great astronomer as he has <br />made <br />  sequential<br />      astronomical references on important dates related to the life <br />of <br />  Shri Ram<br />      indicating the location of planets vis-a-vis zodiac <br />  constellations and the<br />      other stars (nakshatras). Needless to add that similar position <br />  of planets<br />      and nakshatras is not repeated in thousands of years. By <br />entering <br />  the<br />      precise details of the planetary configuration of the important <br />  events in<br />      the life of Shri Ram as given in the Valmiki Ramayan in the <br />  software named<br />      "Planetarium" corresponding exact dates of these events <br />according <br />  to the<br />      English calendar can be known.</p>
<p>      Mr Pushkar Bhatnagar of the Indian Revenue Service had acquired <br />  this<br />      software from the US. It is used to predict the solar/lunar <br />  eclipses and<br />      distance and location of other planets from earth. He entered <br />the <br />  relevant<br />      details about the planetary positions narrated by Maharishi <br />  Valmiki and<br />      obtained very interesting and convincing results, which almost <br />  determine the<br />      important dates starting from the birth of Shri Ram to the date <br />  of his<br />      coming back to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.</p>
<p>      Maharishi Valmiki has recorded in Bal Kaand sarga 19 and shloka <br />  eight and<br />      nine (1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram was born on ninth tithi of <br />Chaitra <br />  month when<br />      the position of different planets vis-a-vis zodiac <br />constellations <br />  and<br />      nakshatras (visible stars) were: i) Sun in Aries; ii) Saturn in <br />  Libra; iii)<br />      Jupiter in Cancer; iv) Venus in Pisces; v) Mars in Capricorn; <br />vi) <br />  Lunar<br />      month of Chaitra; vii) Ninth day after no moon; viii) Lagna as <br />  Cancer<br />      (cancer was rising in the east); ix) Moon on the Punarvasu <br />(Gemini<br />      constellation &amp; Pllux star); x) Day time (around noon).</p>
<p>      This data was fed into the software. The results indicated that <br />  this was<br />      exactly the location of planets/stars in the noon of January <br />10, <br />  5114 BC.<br />      Thus Shri Ram was born on January 10, 5114 BC (7121 years <br />back). <br />  As per the<br />      Indian calendar it was the ninth day of Shukla Paksha in <br />Chaitra <br />  month and<br />      the time was around 12 to 1 noontime. This is exactly the time <br />  and date when<br />      Ram Navmi is celebrated all over India.</p>
<p>      Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya. This fact can be ascertained from <br />  several<br />      books written by Indian and foreign authors before and after <br />the <br />  birth of<br />      Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasa's <br />Raghuvansam, <br />  Baudh and<br />      Jain literature, etc. These books have narrated in great detail <br />  the<br />      location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya which had <br />many <br />  palaces and<br />      temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was located on the <br />  banks of the<br />      Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one side and <br />  Mithila on the<br />      other side. Normally 7,000 years is a very long period during <br />  which<br />      earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign invasions change the <br />  course of<br />      rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alter the territories. <br />  Therefore,<br />      the task of unearthing the facts is monumental. The present <br />  Ayodhya has<br />      shrunk in size and the rivers have changed their course about <br />40 <br />  km<br />      north/south.</p>
<p>      Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya in his childhood (13th year as per <br />  Valmiki<br />      Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwamitra who lived in Tapovan <br />  (Sidhhashram). From<br />      there he went to Mithila, King Janaka's kingdom. Here he <br />married <br />  Sita after<br />      breaking Shiv Dhanusha. Researchers have gone along the route <br />  adopted by<br />      Shri Ram as narrated in the Valmiki Ramayan and found 23 places <br />  which have<br />      memorials that commemorate the events related to the life of <br />Shri <br />  Ram. These<br />      include Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhhashram, <br />  Gautamashram,<br />      Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc. Memorials are built <br />for <br />  great men<br />      and not for fictitious characters.</p>
<p>      Date of exile of Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayan's <br />  Ayodhya<br />      Kand (2/4/18) that Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the king <br />  because Sun,<br />      Mars and Rahu had surrounded his nakshatra and normally under <br />  such planetary<br />      configuration the king dies or becomes a victim of <br />conspiracies. <br />  Dashratha's<br />      zodiac sign was Pisces and his nakshatra was Rewati. This <br />  planetary<br />      configuration was prevailing on the January 5, 5089 BC, and it <br />  was on this<br />      day that Shri Ram left Ayodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, he <br />  was 25 years<br />      old at that time (5114-5089). There are several shlokas in <br />  Valmiki Ramayan<br />      which indicate that Shri Ram was 25-years-old when he left <br />  Ayodhya for<br />      exile.</p>
<p>      Valmiki Ramayan refers to the solar eclipse at the time of war <br />  with<br />      Khardushan in later half of 13th year of Shri Ram's exile. It <br />is <br />  also<br />      mentioned it was amavasya day and Mars was in the middle. When <br />  this data was<br />      entered, the software indicated that there was a solar eclipse <br />on <br />  October 7,<br />      5077 BC, (amavasya day) which could be seen from Panchvati. The <br />  planetary<br />      configuration was also the same - Mars was in the middle, on <br />one <br />  side were<br />      Venus and Mercury and on the other side were Sun and Saturn. On <br />  the basis of<br />      planetary configurations described in various other chapters, <br />the <br />  date on<br />      which Ravana was killed works out to be December 4, 5076 BC, <br />and <br />  Shri Ram<br />      completed 14 years of exile on January 2, 5075 BC, and that day <br />  was also<br />      Navami of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month. Thus Shri Ram had <br />come <br />  back to<br />      Ayodhya at the age of 39 (5114-5075).</p>
<p>      A colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched on places visited by Shri <br />  Ram during<br />      his exile, and sequentially moved to the places stated as <br />visited <br />  by Shri<br />      Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan, starting from Ayodhya he went right <br />  upto<br />      Rameshwaram. He found 195 places which still have the memorials <br />  connected to<br />      the events narrated in the Ramayana relating to the life of <br />Shri <br />  Ram and<br />      Sita. These include Tamsa Tal (Mandah), Shringverpur <br />(Singraur), <br />  Bhardwaj<br />      Ashram (situated near Allahabad), Atri Ashram, Markandaya <br />Ashram <br />  (Markundi),<br />      Chitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of Godavari), Panchvati, Sita <br />  Sarovar, Ram<br />      Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nasik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkindha <br />  (village<br />      Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Rameshwar temple.</p>
<p>      In Valmiki Ramayan it is mentioned that Shri Ram's army <br />  constructed a<br />      bridge over the sea between Rameshwaram and Lanka. After <br />crossing <br />  this<br />      bridge, Shri Ram's army had defeated Ravana. Recently, NASA put <br />  pictures on<br />      the Internet of a man-made bridge, the ruins of which are lying <br />  submerged in<br />      Palk Strait between Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka. Recently the Sri <br />  Lankan<br />      Government had expressed the desire to develop Sita Vatika as a <br />  tourist<br />      spot. Sri Lankans believe this was Ashok Vatika where Ravana <br />had <br />  kept Sita<br />      as a prisoner (in 5076 BC).</p>
<p>      Indian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the <br />  Suryavansh and he<br />      was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other <br />relevant <br />  particulars<br />      of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written <br />  about 80 years<br />      ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram. Professor Subhash Kak of Lousiana <br />  University,<br />      in his book, The Astronomical Code of the Rig Veda, has also <br />  listed 63<br />      ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayodhya. Sri Ram's <br />ancestors <br />  have been<br />      traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha, King Aja, King Raghu, <br />  King Dilip<br />Gujarat,<br />      everywhere people believe in the reality of Shri Ram's <br />existence,<br />      particularly in the tribal areas of Himachal, Rajasthan, Madhya <br />  Pradesh and<br />      the North-East. Most of the festivals celebrated in these areas <br />  revolve<br />      around the events in the life of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna.</p>
<p>      The events and places related to the life of Shri Ram and Sita <br />  are true<br />      cultural and social heritage of every Indian irrespective of <br />  caste and<br />      creed. Therefore, it is common heritage. After all, Shri Ram <br />  belonged to the<br />      period when Prophet Mohammed or Jesus Christ were not born and <br />  Muslim or<br />      Christian faiths were unknown to the world. The words Hindu <br />  (resident of<br />      Hindustan) and Indian (resident of India) were synonymous. <br />India <br />  was also<br />      known as Bharat (land of knowledge) and Aryavarta (where Aryans <br />  live) and<br />      Hindustan (land of "Hindus" - derived from word Indus).</p>
<p>      During Ram Rajya, the evils of caste system based on birth were<br />      non-existent. In fact, Maharishi Valmiki is stated to be of <br />  shudra class<br />      (scheduled caste), still Sita lived with him as his adopted <br />  daughter after<br />      she was banished from Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his ashram <br />as <br />  his<br />      disciples. We need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki was <br />  perhaps the<br />      first great astronomer and that his study of planetary <br />  configurations has<br />      stood the test of times. Even the latest computer softwares have<br />      corroborated his astronomical calculations, which proves that <br />he <br />  did not<br />      commit any error.</p>
<p>      Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe. Shri <br />Ram's <br />  army,<br />      which succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by various <br />  tribals from<br />      Central and South India. The facts, events and all other <br />details <br />  relating to<br />      the life of Shri Ram are the common heritage of all the Indians <br />  including<br />      scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims, Christians, etc.</p>
<p>      Prophet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ was <br />born <br />  2,000<br />      years back. Gautam Buddha was born 2,600 years back, whereas <br />Ram <br />  was born<br />      7,000 years back. Hence, discovering the details relating to <br />Shri <br />  Ram's life<br />      would be lot more difficult as destruction caused by floods, <br />  earthquakes and<br />      invasions etc., would be far greater. But, should that stop our <br />  quest for<br />      learning more about our cultural heritage?</p>
<p>      As Indians, let us all take pride in the fact that the Indian <br />  civilisation<br />      is the most ancient civilisation today. It is certainly more <br />than <br />  10,000<br />      years old. Therefore, let us reject the story of Aryan invasion <br />  in India in<br />      1,500 BC as motivated implantation. In fact Max Mueller, who <br />was <br />  the creator<br />      of this theory had himself rejected it. Let us admit that <br />during <br />  the British<br />      Rule, we were educated in the schools based on Macaulay school <br />of <br />  thinking<br />      which believed that everything Indian was inferior and that <br />  entire "Indian<br />      literature was not worth even one book rack in England". If <br />there <br />  were<br />      similarities in certain features of Indian people and people <br />from <br />  Central<br />      Europe, then automatic inference drawn was that the Aryans <br />coming <br />  from<br />      Europe invaded India and settled here. No one dared of thinking <br />  in any other<br />      way. Therefore, there is urgency for the historians and all <br />other<br />      intellectuals to stop reducing Indian history to myth. There is <br />  need to<br />      gather, dig out, search, unearth and analyse all the evidences, <br />  which would<br />      throw more light on ancient Indian civilisation and culture.</p>
<p>      There is need for the print and the electronic media to take <br />note <br />  of these<br />      facts and create atmosphere which would motivate our young and <br />  educated<br />      youth to carry out research and unearth true facts about the <br />  ancient Indian<br />      civilisation and wisdom and would also encourage them to put <br />  across the<br />      results of their research before the people fearlessly and with <br />a <br />  sense of<br />      pride!</p>

<p>      There is no need of great austerities or penances to worship <br />Lord<br />      Ramacandra, for He accepts even a small service offered by His <br />  devotee. Thus<br />      He is satisfied and as soon as He is satisfied, the devotee is <br />  successful.<br />      Indeed, Lord Sri Ramacandra brought all the devotees of Ayodhya <br />  back home,<br />      back to Godhead.

        <p>Shiva? There is no evidence that Shiva incarnated as human. Krishna <br />of course there has to be since Dwaraka and other places surrounding <br />his story are existing. But again Krishna' story is only a 'purana' <br />and not recorded like Rama's by Valmiki so it is tough to analyse it <br />similar. But would be interesting to know if anyone did. </p>

<p>    *Was Lord Ram Really Born?*</p>
<p>    We Indians are the products of one of the oldest civilisations. <br />We need to<br />    be really proud of our ancient history and cultural heritage. <br />However,<br />    during the British Rule, we developed an inferiority complex, <br />which<br />    adversely affected our quest to unearth facts relating to our <br />glorious past.<br />    But our young and educated men and women, born and brought up in <br />independent<br />    India, are capable of unearthing the true facts and are confident <br />enough to<br />    evaluate these objectively.</p>
<p>    Shri Ram being most basic to Indian "ethos", it is necessary to <br />know who is<br />    Shri Ram? Was he really born? If yes, when and where? As is <br />believed by<br />    crores of people did he really put his feet on the Indian <br />territory from<br />    North to South, reducing the sufferings of mankind and ensuring <br />victory of<br />    good over evil? Let us take a look at historical facts:</p>
<p>    The story of Shri Ram's life was first narrated by Maharishi <br />Valmiki in the<br />    Ramayana, which was written after Shri Ram was crowned as the <br />king of<br />    Ayodhya. Maharishi Valmiki was a great astronomer as he has made <br />sequential<br />    astronomical references on important dates related to the life of <br />Shri Ram<br />    indicating the location of planets vis-a-vis zodiac <br />constellations and the<br />    other stars (nakshatras). Needless to add that similar position <br />of planets<br />    and nakshatras is not repeated in thousands of years. By entering <br />the<br />    precise details of the planetary configuration of the important <br />events in<br />    the life of Shri Ram as given in the Valmiki Ramayan in the <br />software named<br />    "Planetarium" corresponding exact dates of these events according <br />to the<br />    English calendar can be known.</p>
<p>    Mr Pushkar Bhatnagar of the Indian Revenue Service had acquired <br />this<br />    software from the US. It is used to predict the solar/lunar <br />eclipses and<br />    distance and location of other planets from earth. He entered the <br />relevant<br />    details about the planetary positions narrated by Maharishi <br />Valmiki and<br />    obtained very interesting and convincing results, which almost <br />determine the<br />    important dates starting from the birth of Shri Ram to the date <br />of his<br />    coming back to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.</p>
<p>    Maharishi Valmiki has recorded in Bal Kaand sarga 19 and shloka <br />eight and<br />    nine (1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram was born on ninth tithi of Chaitra <br />month when<br />    the position of different planets vis-a-vis zodiac constellations <br />and<br />    nakshatras (visible stars) were: i) Sun in Aries; ii) Saturn in <br />Libra; iii)<br />    Jupiter in Cancer; iv) Venus in Pisces; v) Mars in Capricorn; vi) <br />Lunar<br />    month of Chaitra; vii) Ninth day after no moon; viii) Lagna as <br />Cancer<br />    (cancer was rising in the east); ix) Moon on the Punarvasu (Gemini<br />    constellation &amp; Pllux star); x) Day time (around noon).</p>
<p>    This data was fed into the software. The results indicated that <br />this was<br />    exactly the location of planets/stars in the noon of January 10, <br />5114 BC.<br />    Thus Shri Ram was born on January 10, 5114 BC (7121 years back). <br />As per the<br />    Indian calendar it was the ninth day of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra <br />month and<br />    the time was around 12 to 1 noontime. This is exactly the time <br />and date when<br />    Ram Navmi is celebrated all over India.</p>
<p>    Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya. This fact can be ascertained from <br />several<br />    books written by Indian and foreign authors before and after the <br />birth of<br />    Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasa's Raghuvansam, <br />Baudh and<br />    Jain literature, etc. These books have narrated in great detail <br />the<br />    location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya which had many <br />palaces and<br />    temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was located on the <br />banks of the<br />    Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one side and <br />Mithila on the<br />    other side. Normally 7,000 years is a very long period during <br />which<br />    earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign invasions change the <br />course of<br />    rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alter the territories. <br />Therefore,<br />    the task of unearthing the facts is monumental. The present <br />Ayodhya has<br />    shrunk in size and the rivers have changed their course about 40 <br />km<br />    north/south.</p>
<p>    Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya in his childhood (13th year as per <br />Valmiki<br />    Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwamitra who lived in Tapovan <br />(Sidhhashram). From<br />    there he went to Mithila, King Janaka's kingdom. Here he married <br />Sita after<br />    breaking Shiv Dhanusha. Researchers have gone along the route <br />adopted by<br />    Shri Ram as narrated in the Valmiki Ramayan and found 23 places <br />which have<br />    memorials that commemorate the events related to the life of Shri <br />Ram. These<br />    include Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhhashram, <br />Gautamashram,<br />    Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc. Memorials are built for <br />great men<br />    and not for fictitious characters.</p>
<p>    Date of exile of Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayan's <br />Ayodhya<br />    Kand (2/4/18) that Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the king <br />because Sun,<br />    Mars and Rahu had surrounded his nakshatra and normally under <br />such planetary<br />    configuration the king dies or becomes a victim of conspiracies. <br />Dashratha's<br />    zodiac sign was Pisces and his nakshatra was Rewati. This <br />planetary<br />    configuration was prevailing on the January 5, 5089 BC, and it <br />was on this<br />    day that Shri Ram left Ayodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, he <br />was 25 years<br />    old at that time (5114-5089). There are several shlokas in <br />Valmiki Ramayan<br />    which indicate that Shri Ram was 25-years-old when he left <br />Ayodhya for<br />    exile.</p>
<p>    Valmiki Ramayan refers to the solar eclipse at the time of war <br />with<br />    Khardushan in later half of 13th year of Shri Ram's exile. It is <br />also<br />    mentioned it was amavasya day and Mars was in the middle. When <br />this data was<br />    entered, the software indicated that there was a solar eclipse on <br />October 7,<br />    5077 BC, (amavasya day) which could be seen from Panchvati. The <br />planetary<br />    configuration was also the same - Mars was in the middle, on one <br />side were<br />    Venus and Mercury and on the other side were Sun and Saturn. On <br />the basis of<br />    planetary configurations described in various other chapters, the <br />date on<br />    which Ravana was killed works out to be December 4, 5076 BC, and <br />Shri Ram<br />    completed 14 years of exile on January 2, 5075 BC, and that day <br />was also<br />    Navami of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month. Thus Shri Ram had come <br />back to<br />    Ayodhya at the age of 39 (5114-5075).</p>
<p>    A colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched on places visited by Shri <br />Ram during<br />    his exile, and sequentially moved to the places stated as visited <br />by Shri<br />    Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan, starting from Ayodhya he went right <br />upto<br />    Rameshwaram. He found 195 places which still have the memorials <br />connected to<br />    the events narrated in the Ramayana relating to the life of Shri <br />Ram and<br />    Sita. These include Tamsa Tal (Mandah), Shringverpur (Singraur), <br />Bhardwaj<br />    Ashram (situated near Allahabad), Atri Ashram, Markandaya Ashram <br />(Markundi),<br />    Chitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of Godavari), Panchvati, Sita <br />Sarovar, Ram<br />    Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nasik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkindha <br />(village<br />    Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Rameshwar temple.</p>
<p>    In Valmiki Ramayan it is mentioned that Shri Ram's army <br />constructed a<br />    bridge over the sea between Rameshwaram and Lanka. After crossing <br />this<br />    bridge, Shri Ram's army had defeated Ravana. Recently, NASA put <br />pictures on<br />    the Internet of a man-made bridge, the ruins of which are lying <br />submerged in<br />    Palk Strait between Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka. Recently the Sri <br />Lankan<br />    Government had expressed the desire to develop Sita Vatika as a <br />tourist<br />    spot. Sri Lankans believe this was Ashok Vatika where Ravana had <br />kept Sita<br />    as a prisoner (in 5076 BC).</p>
<p>    Indian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the <br />Suryavansh and he<br />    was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other relevant <br />particulars<br />    of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written <br />about 80 years<br />    ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram. Professor Subhash Kak of Lousiana <br />University,<br />    in his book, The Astronomical Code of the Rig Veda, has also <br />listed 63<br />    ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayodhya. Sri Ram's ancestors <br />have been<br />    traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha, King Aja, King Raghu, <br />King Dilip<br />    everywhere people believe in the reality of Shri Ram's existence,<br />    particularly in the tribal areas of Himachal, Rajasthan, Madhya <br />Pradesh and<br />    the North-East. Most of the festivals celebrated in these areas <br />revolve<br />    around the events in the life of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna.</p>
<p>    The events and places related to the life of Shri Ram and Sita <br />are true<br />    cultural and social heritage of every Indian irrespective of <br />caste and<br />    creed. Therefore, it is common heritage. After all, Shri Ram <br />belonged to the<br />    period when Prophet Mohammed or Jesus Christ were not born and <br />Muslim or<br />    Christian faiths were unknown to the world. The words Hindu <br />(resident of<br />    Hindustan) and Indian (resident of India) were synonymous. India <br />was also<br />    known as Bharat (land of knowledge) and Aryavarta (where Aryans <br />live) and<br />    Hindustan (land of "Hindus" - derived from word Indus).</p>
<p>    During Ram Rajya, the evils of caste system based on birth were<br />    non-existent. In fact, Maharishi Valmiki is stated to be of <br />shudra class<br />    (scheduled caste), still Sita lived with him as his adopted <br />daughter after<br />    she was banished from Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his ashram as <br />his<br />    disciples. We need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki was <br />perhaps the<br />    first great astronomer and that his study of planetary <br />configurations has<br />    stood the test of times. Even the latest computer softwares have<br />    corroborated his astronomical calculations, which proves that he <br />did not<br />    commit any error.</p>
<p>    Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe. Shri Ram's <br />army,<br />    which succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by various <br />tribals from<br />    Central and South India. The facts, events and all other details <br />relating to<br />    the life of Shri Ram are the common heritage of all the Indians <br />including<br />    scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims, Christians, etc.</p>
<p>    Prophet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ was born <br />2,000<br />    years back. Gautam Buddha was born 2,600 years back, whereas Ram <br />was born<br />    7,000 years back. Hence, discovering the details relating to Shri <br />Ram's life<br />    would be lot more difficult as destruction caused by floods, <br />earthquakes and<br />    invasions etc., would be far greater. But, should that stop our <br />quest for<br />    learning more about our cultural heritage?</p>
<p>    As Indians, let us all take pride in the fact that the Indian <br />civilisation<br />    is the most ancient civilisation today. It is certainly more than <br />10,000<br />    years old.

<p>    There is need for the print and the electronic media to take note <br />of these<br />    facts and create atmosphere which would motivate our young and <br />educated<br />    youth to carry out research and unearth true facts about the <br />ancient Indian<br />    civilisation and wisdom and would also encourage them to put <br />across the<br />    results of their research before the people fearlessly and with a <br />sense of<br />    pride!</p>

<p>  *Was Lord Ram Really Born?*</p>
<p>  We Indians are the products of one of the oldest civilisations. We need to<br />  be really proud of our ancient history and cultural heritage. However,<br />  during the British Rule, we developed an inferiority complex, which<br />  adversely affected our quest to unearth facts relating to our glorious past.<br />  But our young and educated men and women, born and brought up in independent<br />  India, are capable of unearthing the true facts and are confident enough to<br />  evaluate these objectively.</p>
<p>  Shri Ram being most basic to Indian "ethos", it is necessary to know who is<br />  Shri Ram? Was he really born? If yes, when and where? As is believed by<br />  crores of people did he really put his feet on the Indian territory from<br />  North to South, reducing the sufferings of mankind and ensuring victory of<br />  good over evil? Let us take a look at historical facts:</p>
<p>  The story of Shri Ram's life was first narrated by Maharishi Valmiki in the<br />  Ramayana, which was written after Shri Ram was crowned as the king of<br />  Ayodhya. Maharishi Valmiki was a great astronomer as he has made sequential<br />  astronomical references on important dates related to the life of Shri Ram<br />  indicating the location of planets vis-a-vis zodiac constellations and the<br />  other stars (nakshatras). Needless to add that similar position of planets<br />  and nakshatras is not repeated in thousands of years. By entering the<br />  precise details of the planetary configuration of the important events in<br />  the life of Shri Ram as given in the Valmiki Ramayan in the software named<br />  "Planetarium" corresponding exact dates of these events according to the<br />  English calendar can be known.</p>
<p>  Mr Pushkar Bhatnagar of the Indian Revenue Service had acquired this<br />  software from the US. It is used to predict the solar/lunar eclipses and<br />  distance and location of other planets from earth. He entered the relevant<br />  details about the planetary positions narrated by Maharishi Valmiki and<br />  obtained very interesting and convincing results, which almost determine the<br />  important dates starting from the birth of Shri Ram to the date of his<br />  coming back to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.</p>
<p>  Maharishi Valmiki has recorded in Bal Kaand sarga 19 and shloka eight and<br />  nine (1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram was born on ninth tithi of Chaitra month when<br />  the position of different planets vis-a-vis zodiac constellations and<br />  nakshatras (visible stars) were: i) Sun in Aries; ii) Saturn in Libra; iii)<br />  Jupiter in Cancer; iv) Venus in Pisces; v) Mars in Capricorn; vi) Lunar<br />  month of Chaitra; vii) Ninth day after no moon; viii) Lagna as Cancer<br />  (cancer was rising in the east); ix) Moon on the Punarvasu (Gemini<br />  constellation &amp; Pllux star); x) Day time (around noon).</p>
<p>  This data was fed into the software. The results indicated that this was<br />  exactly the location of planets/stars in the noon of January 10, 5114 BC.<br />  Thus Shri Ram was born on January 10, 5114 BC (7121 years back). As per the<br />  Indian calendar it was the ninth day of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month and<br />  the time was around 12 to 1 noontime. This is exactly the time and date when<br />  Ram Navmi is celebrated all over India.</p>
<p>  Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya. This fact can be ascertained from several<br />  books written by Indian and foreign authors before and after the birth of<br />  Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasa's Raghuvansam, Baudh and<br />  Jain literature, etc. These books have narrated in great detail the<br />  location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya which had many palaces and<br />  temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was located on the banks of the<br />  Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one side and Mithila on the<br />  other side. Normally 7,000 years is a very long period during which<br />  earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign invasions change the course of<br />  rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alter the territories. Therefore,<br />  the task of unearthing the facts is monumental. The present Ayodhya has<br />  shrunk in size and the rivers have changed their course about 40 km<br />  north/south.</p>
<p>  Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya in his childhood (13th year as per Valmiki<br />  Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwamitra who lived in Tapovan (Sidhhashram). From<br />  there he went to Mithila, King Janaka's kingdom. Here he married Sita after<br />  breaking Shiv Dhanusha. Researchers have gone along the route adopted by<br />  Shri Ram as narrated in the Valmiki Ramayan and found 23 places which have<br />  memorials that commemorate the events related to the life of Shri Ram. These<br />  include Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhhashram, Gautamashram,<br />  Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc. Memorials are built for great men<br />  and not for fictitious characters.</p>
<p>  Date of exile of Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayan's Ayodhya<br />  Kand (2/4/18) that Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the king because Sun,<br />  Mars and Rahu had surrounded his nakshatra and normally under such planetary<br />  configuration the king dies or becomes a victim of conspiracies. Dashratha's<br />  zodiac sign was Pisces and his nakshatra was Rewati. This planetary<br />  configuration was prevailing on the January 5, 5089 BC, and it was on this<br />  day that Shri Ram left Ayodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, he was 25 years<br />  old at that time (5114-5089). There are several shlokas in Valmiki Ramayan<br />  which indicate that Shri Ram was 25-years-old when he left Ayodhya for<br />  exile.</p>
<p>  Valmiki Ramayan refers to the solar eclipse at the time of war with<br />  Khardushan in later half of 13th year of Shri Ram's exile. It is also<br />  mentioned it was amavasya day and Mars was in the middle. When this data was<br />  entered, the software indicated that there was a solar eclipse on October7,<br />  5077 BC, (amavasya day) which could be seen from Panchvati. The planetary<br />  configuration was also the same - Mars was in the middle, on one side were<br />  Venus and Mercury and on the other side were Sun and Saturn. On the basisof<br />  planetary configurations described in various other chapters, the date on<br />  which Ravana was killed works out to be December 4, 5076 BC, and Shri Ram<br />  completed 14 years of exile on January 2, 5075 BC, and that day was also<br />  Navami of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month. Thus Shri Ram had come back to<br />  Ayodhya at the age of 39 (5114-5075).</p>
<p>  A colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched on places visited by Shri Ram during<br />  his exile, and sequentially moved to the places stated as visited by Shri<br />  Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan, starting from Ayodhya he went right upto<br />  Rameshwaram. He found 195 places which still have the memorials connectedto<br />  the events narrated in the Ramayana relating to the life of Shri Ram and<br />  Sita. These include Tamsa Tal (Mandah), Shringverpur (Singraur), Bhardwaj<br />  Ashram (situated near Allahabad), Atri Ashram, Markandaya Ashram (Markundi),<br />  Chitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of Godavari), Panchvati, Sita Sarovar, Ram<br />  Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nasik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkindha (village<br />  Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Rameshwar temple.</p>
<p>  In Valmiki Ramayan it is mentioned that Shri Ram's army constructed a<br />  bridge over the sea between Rameshwaram and Lanka. After crossing this<br />  bridge, Shri Ram's army had defeated Ravana. Recently, NASA put pictures on<br />  the Internet of a man-made bridge, the ruins of which are lying submergedin<br />  Palk Strait between Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka. Recently the Sri Lankan<br />  Government had expressed the desire to develop Sita Vatika as a tourist<br />  spot. Sri Lankans believe this was Ashok Vatika where Ravana had kept Sita<br />  as a prisoner (in 5076 BC).</p>
<p>  Indian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the Suryavansh and he<br />  was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other relevant particulars<br />  of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written about 80 years<br />  ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram. Professor Subhash Kak of Lousiana University,<br />  in his book, The Astronomical Code of the Rig Veda, has also listed 63<br />  ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayodhya. Sri Ram's ancestors have been<br />  traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha, King Aja, King Raghu, King Dilip<br />  everywhere people believe in the reality of Shri Ram's existence,<br />  particularly in the tribal areas of Himachal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and<br />  the North-East. Most of the festivals celebrated in these areas revolve<br />  around the events in the life of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna.</p>
<p>  The events and places related to the life of Shri Ram and Sita are true<br />  cultural and social heritage of every Indian irrespective of caste and<br />  creed. Therefore, it is common heritage. After all, Shri Ram belonged to the<br />  period when Prophet Mohammed or Jesus Christ were not born and Muslim or<br />  Christian faiths were unknown to the world. The words Hindu (resident of<br />  Hindustan) and Indian (resident of India) were synonymous. India was also<br />  known as Bharat (land of knowledge) and Aryavarta (where Aryans live) and<br />  Hindustan (land of "Hindus" - derived from word Indus).</p>
<p>  During Ram Rajya, the evils of caste system based on birth were<br />  non-existent. In fact, Maharishi Valmiki is stated to be of shudra class<br />  (scheduled caste), still Sita lived with him as his adopted daughter after<br />  she was banished from Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his ashram as his<br />  disciples. We need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki was perhaps the<br />  first great astronomer and that his study of planetary configurations has<br />  stood the test of times. Even the latest computer softwares have<br />  corroborated his astronomical calculations, which proves that he did not<br />  commit any error.</p>
<p>  Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe. Shri Ram's army,<br />  which succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by various tribals from<br />  Central and South India. The facts, events and all other details relatingto<br />  the life of Shri Ram are the common heritage of all the Indians including<br />  scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims, Christians, etc.</p>
<p>  Prophet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ was born 2,000<br />  years back. Gautam Buddha was born 2,600 years back, whereas Ram was born<br />  7,000 years back. Hence, discovering the details relating to Shri Ram's life<br />  would be lot more difficult as destruction caused by floods, earthquakes and<br />  invasions etc., would be far greater. But, should that stop our quest for<br />  learning more about our cultural heritage?</p>
<p>  As Indians, let us all take pride in the fact that the Indian civilisation<br />  is the most ancient civilisation today. It is certainly more than 10,000<br />  years old. Therefore, let us reject the story of Aryan invasion in India in<br />  1,500 BC as motivated implantation. In fact Max Mueller, who was the creator<br />  of this theory had himself rejected it. Let us admit that during the British<br />  Rule, we were educated in the schools based on Macaulay school of thinking<br />  which believed that everything Indian was inferior and that entire "Indian<br />  literature was not worth even one book rack in England". If there were<br />  similarities in certain features of Indian people and people from Central<br />  Europe, then automatic inference drawn was that the Aryans coming from<br />  Europe invaded India and settled here. No one dared of thinking in any other<br />  way. Therefore, there is urgency for the historians and all other<br />  intellectuals to stop reducing Indian history to myth. There is need to<br />  gather, dig out, search, unearth and analyse all the evidences, which would<br />  throw more light on ancient Indian civilisation and culture.</p>
<p>  There is need for the print and the electronic media to take note of these<br />  facts and create atmosphere which would motivate our young and educated<br />  youth to carry out research and unearth true facts about the ancient Indian<br />  civilisation and wisdom and would also encourage them to put across the<br />  results of their research before the people fearlessly and with a sense of<br />  pride!</p>

It is used to predict the solar/lunar <br />eclipses and<br />  distance and location of other planets from earth. He entered the <br />relevant<br />  details about the planetary positions narrated by Maharishi Valmiki <br />and<br />  obtained very interesting and convincing results, which almost <br />determine the<br />  important dates starting from the birth of Shri Ram to the date of <br />his<br />  coming back to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile.</p>
<p>  Maharishi Valmiki has recorded in Bal Kaand sarga 19 and shloka <br />eight and<br />  nine (1/18/8,9) that Shri Ram was born on ninth tithi of Chaitra <br />month when<br />  the position of different planets vis-a-vis zodiac constellations <br />and<br />  nakshatras (visible stars) were: i) Sun in Aries; ii) Saturn in <br />Libra; iii)<br />  Jupiter in Cancer; iv) Venus in Pisces; v) Mars in Capricorn; vi) <br />Lunar<br />  month of Chaitra; vii) Ninth day after no moon; viii) Lagna as <br />Cancer<br />  (cancer was rising in the east); ix) Moon on the Punarvasu (Gemini<br />  constellation &amp; Pllux star); x) Day time (around noon).</p>
<p>  This data was fed into the software. The results indicated that <br />this was<br />  exactly the location of planets/stars in the noon of January 10, <br />5114 BC.<br />  Thus Shri Ram was born on January 10, 5114 BC (7121 years back). As <br />per the<br />  Indian calendar it was the ninth day of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra <br />month and<br />  the time was around 12 to 1 noontime. This is exactly the time and <br />date when<br />  Ram Navmi is celebrated all over India.</p>
<p>  Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya. This fact can be ascertained from <br />several<br />  books written by Indian and foreign authors before and after the <br />birth of<br />  Christ - Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsi Ramayan, Kalidasa's Raghuvansam, <br />Baudh and<br />  Jain literature, etc. These books have narrated in great detail the<br />  location, rich architecture and beauty of Ayodhya which had many <br />palaces and<br />  temples built all over the kingdom. Ayodhya was located on the <br />banks of the<br />  Saryu river with Ganga and Panchal Pradesh on one side and Mithila <br />on the<br />  other side. Normally 7,000 years is a very long period during which<br />  earthquakes, storms, floods and foreign invasions change the course <br />of<br />  rivers, destroy the towns/buildings and alter the territories. <br />Therefore,<br />  the task of unearthing the facts is monumental. The present Ayodhya <br />has<br />  shrunk in size and the rivers have changed their course about 40 km<br />  north/south.</p>
<p>  Shri Ram went out of Ayodhya in his childhood (13th year as per <br />Valmiki<br />  Ramayan) with Rishi Vishwamitra who lived in Tapovan (Sidhhashram). <br />From<br />  there he went to Mithila, King Janaka's kingdom. Here he married <br />Sita after<br />  breaking Shiv Dhanusha. Researchers have gone along the route <br />adopted by<br />  Shri Ram as narrated in the Valmiki Ramayan and found 23 places <br />which have<br />  memorials that commemorate the events related to the life of Shri <br />Ram. These<br />  include Shringi Ashram, Ramghat, Tadka Van, Sidhhashram, <br />Gautamashram,<br />  Janakpur (now in Nepal), Sita Kund, etc. Memorials are built for <br />great men<br />  and not for fictitious characters.</p>
<p>  Date of exile of Shri Ram: It is mentioned in Valmiki Ramayan's <br />Ayodhya Kand<br />  (2/4/18) that Dashratha wanted to make Shri Ram the king because <br />Sun, Mars<br />  and Rahu had surrounded his nakshatra and normally under such <br />planetary<br />  configuration the king dies or becomes a victim of conspiracies. <br />Dashratha's<br />  zodiac sign was Pisces and his nakshatra was Rewati. This planetary<br />  configuration was prevailing on the January 5, 5089 BC, and it was <br />on this<br />  day that Shri Ram left Ayodhya for 14 years of exile. Thus, he was <br />25 years<br />  old at that time (5114-5089). There are several shlokas in Valmiki <br />Ramayan<br />  which indicate that Shri Ram was 25-years-old when he left Ayodhya <br />for<br />  exile.</p>
<p>  Valmiki Ramayan refers to the solar eclipse at the time of war with<br />  Khardushan in later half of 13th year of Shri Ram's exile. It is <br />also<br />  mentioned it was amavasya day and Mars was in the middle. When this <br />data was<br />  entered, the software indicated that there was a solar eclipse on <br />October 7,<br />  5077 BC, (amavasya day) which could be seen from Panchvati. The <br />planetary<br />  configuration was also the same - Mars was in the middle, on one <br />side were<br />  Venus and Mercury and on the other side were Sun and Saturn. On the <br />basis of<br />  planetary configurations described in various other chapters, the <br />date on<br />  which Ravana was killed works out to be December 4, 5076 BC, and <br />Shri Ram<br />  completed 14 years of exile on January 2, 5075 BC, and that day was <br />also<br />  Navami of Shukla Paksha in Chaitra month. Thus Shri Ram had come <br />back to<br />  Ayodhya at the age of 39 (5114-5075).</p>
<p>  A colleague, Dr Ram Avtar, researched on places visited by Shri Ram <br />during<br />  his exile, and sequentially moved to the places stated as visited <br />by Shri<br />  Ram in the Valmiki Ramayan, starting from Ayodhya he went right upto<br />  Rameshwaram. He found 195 places which still have the memorials <br />connected to<br />  the events narrated in the Ramayana relating to the life of Shri <br />Ram and<br />  Sita. These include Tamsa Tal (Mandah), Shringverpur (Singraur), <br />Bhardwaj<br />  Ashram (situated near Allahabad), Atri Ashram, Markandaya Ashram <br />(Markundi),<br />  Chitrakoot, Pamakuti (on banks of Godavari), Panchvati, Sita <br />Sarovar, Ram<br />  Kund in Triambakeshwar near Nasik, Shabari Ashram, Kishkindha <br />(village<br />  Annagorai), Dhanushkoti and Rameshwar temple.</p>
<p>  In Valmiki Ramayan it is mentioned that Shri Ram's army constructed <br />a bridge<br />  over the sea between Rameshwaram and Lanka. After crossing this <br />bridge, Shri<br />  Ram's army had defeated Ravana. Recently, NASA put pictures on the <br />Internet<br />  of a man-made bridge, the ruins of which are lying submerged in <br />Palk Strait<br />  between Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka. Recently the Sri Lankan <br />Government had<br />  expressed the desire to develop Sita Vatika as a tourist spot. Sri <br />Lankans<br />  believe this was Ashok Vatika where Ravana had kept Sita as a <br />prisoner (in<br />  5076 BC).</p>
<p>  Indian history has recorded that Shri Ram belonged to the <br />Suryavansh and he<br />  was the 64th ruler of this dynasty. The names and other relevant <br />particulars<br />  of previous 63 kings are listed in Ayodhya Ka Itihas written about <br />80 years<br />  ago by Rai Bahadur Sita Ram. Professor Subhash Kak of Lousiana <br />University,<br />  in his book, The Astronomical Code of the Rig Veda, has also listed <br />63<br />  ancestors of Shri Ram who ruled over Ayodhya. Sri Ram's ancestors <br />have been<br />  traced out as: Shri Ram, King Dashratha, King Aja, King Raghu, King <br />Dilip<br />  everywhere people believe in the reality of Shri Ram's existence,<br />  particularly in the tribal areas of Himachal, Rajasthan, Madhya <br />Pradesh and<br />  the North-East. Most of the festivals celebrated in these areas <br />revolve<br />  around the events in the life of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna.</p>
<p>  The events and places related to the life of Shri Ram and Sita are <br />true<br />  cultural and social heritage of every Indian irrespective of caste <br />and<br />  creed. Therefore, it is common heritage. After all, Shri Ram <br />belonged to the<br />  period when Prophet Mohammed or Jesus Christ were not born and <br />Muslim or<br />  Christian faiths were unknown to the world. The words Hindu <br />(resident of<br />  Hindustan) and Indian (resident of India) were synonymous. India <br />was also<br />  known as Bharat (land of knowledge) and Aryavarta (where Aryans <br />live) and<br />  Hindustan (land of "Hindus" - derived from word Indus).</p>
<p>  During Ram Rajya, the evils of caste system based on birth were<br />  non-existent. In fact, Maharishi Valmiki is stated to be of shudra <br />class<br />  (scheduled caste), still Sita lived with him as his adopted <br />daughter after<br />  she was banished from Ayodhya. Luv and Kush grew in his ashram as <br />his<br />  disciples. We need to be proud of the fact that Valmiki was perhaps <br />the<br />  first great astronomer and that his study of planetary <br />configurations has<br />  stood the test of times. Even the latest computer softwares have<br />  corroborated his astronomical calculations, which proves that he <br />did not<br />  commit any error.</p>
<p>  Shabari is stated to be belonging to the Bheel tribe. Shri Ram's <br />army, which<br />  succeeded in defeating Ravana, was formed by various tribals from <br />Central<br />  and South India. The facts, events and all other details relating <br />to the<br />  life of Shri Ram are the common heritage of all the Indians <br />including<br />  scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims, Christians, etc.</p>
<p>  Prophet Mohammad was born 1,400 years ago. Jesus Christ was born <br />2,000 years<br />  back. Gautam Buddha was born 2,600 years back, whereas Ram was born <br />7,000<br />  years back. Hence, discovering the details relating to Shri Ram's <br />life would<br />  be lot more difficult as destruction caused by floods, earthquakes <br />and<br />  invasions etc., would be far greater. But, should that stop our <br />quest for<br />  learning more about our cultural heritage?</p>
<p>  As Indians, let us all take pride in the fact that the Indian <br />civilisation<br />  is the most ancient civilisation today. It is certainly more than <br />10,000<br />  years old. Therefore, let us reject the story of Aryan invasion in <br />India in<br />  1,500 BC as motivated implantation. In fact Max Mueller, who was <br />the creator<br />  of this theory had himself rejected it. Let us admit that during <br />the British<br />  Rule, we were educated in the schools based on Macaulay school of <br />thinking<br />  which believed that everything Indian was inferior and that <br />entire "Indian<br />  literature was not worth even one book rack in England". If there <br />were<br />  similarities in certain features of Indian people and people from <br />Central<br />  Europe, then automatic inference drawn was that the Aryans coming <br />from<br />  Europe invaded India and settled here. No one dared of thinking in <br />any other<br />  way. Therefore, there is urgency for the historians and all other<br />  intellectuals to stop reducing Indian history to myth. There is <br />need to<br />  gather, dig out, search, unearth and analyse all the evidences, <br />which would<br />  throw more light on ancient Indian civilisation and culture.</p>
<p>  There is need for the print and the electronic media to take note <br />of these<br />  facts and create atmosphere which would motivate our young and <br />educated<br />  youth to carry out research and unearth true facts about the <br />ancient Indian<br />  civilisation and wisdom and would also encourage them to put across <br />the<br />  results of their research before the people fearlessly and with a <br />sense of<br />  pride!</p>
