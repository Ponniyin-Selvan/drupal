</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>That's an interesting article. But too long to read patiently.. But<br />i did read those parts belonging to southindia and ceylon.</p>
<p>One thing i found is that, these were essentially written by the<br />christian travellers, where in this article, they refer to them as<br />idoloators. There is possibility of one sided view of the european<br />travellers. (their mentioning of cowards!!!...)</p>
<p>Any way, this cannot be rejected on the whole.</p>
<p>Secondly, I could not get how this story fits our case.  </p>
<p>But, there is lot of information from these discussions. The new<br />info, made me to again revisit my old opinions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the main difference i found b/w wars of our kings, and<br />that of the invaders is that, while it was a raja dharma, and widely<br />accepted one, of one country invading another.. But, the societal<br />setup was not disturbed by these wars, although, the warring class<br />suffered heavily.. (that too was an widely accepted, as the<br />characteristics of the kshatriyas.. )</p>
<p>The main reference i bank on these is dharampal's books.  </p>
<p>For example, Even during the worst period of mughals, the social setup<br />of ours were largely intact, with our pre-british educational<br />institutions, the various settlements all across the land, the typical<br />social setup, the educational process, where each village had basic<br />educational facilities etc.</p>
<p>The common people were largely indifferent to the political<br />happenings. That's why, even when mughals dominated, our people<br />relented in and co-existed.</p>
<p>As swamy vivekananda says, the only time, there was mass rebellion is<br />that, whenever there is large interference in the religious beliefs of<br />the common people.</p>
<p>as i said in our earlier mails, the kingdom were conglomeration of<br />small rulers, who accepted a particular kings authority. The king<br />largely operate from his chosen bases like capital city and other<br />forts that he built.<br />The daily affairs were mostly taken care of the small kings.</p>
<p>When another king invades and defeats the present king, then the small<br />rulers tend to accept the new king's authority, and pays tribute to him.</p>
<p>When the mughals invaded, this is what exactly happened. They<br />initially set out for destruction of kafirs, but on seeing such vast<br />settlements of people, and the enormous wealth, coming as tribute from<br />numerous such small rulers, they retained the political setup, with<br />some customization on their part.</p>
<p>They disloged many of the big kings.</p>
<p>But, again, whenever, there is any anti-people policies, the local<br />rulers were sensitive to those, and they took side, to displace the<br />present king.<br />This happened during the moovendar eras also.. when pandiyan king is<br />not fair, the local rulers switched side to chola to dislodge him. <br />Because, they were directly accountable to the people then.</p>
<p>It is this background, that when aurangazeb started large scale<br />demolition and conversion, the local rulers, joined together, and<br />fought back, and since the great sivaji was scoring at that time, they<br />rallied behind him.</p>
<p>Its the same reason, that many of the tamil kings, rallied behind<br />vijayanagara empire, to fight against the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>But, the greatest havoc is wrought by the britishers, who managed to<br />collapse the entire social order. They took over numerous endowments<br />to our indigneous educational institutions, temples, and other<br />institutions of arts, medicine etc. They replaced our political<br />setup, with their own. OUr local rulers were made dummy, and<br />subvertient to collectors.</p>
<p>The absense of the local kings to enforce dharma, and association with<br />non-dharmic based britishers, led to degradation of many of the local<br />rulers.<br />This is where, you have pointed numerous leisure, and palace kings,<br />who doesnot cared about people. Because, there was no one to punish<br />them, for going against the people. For the britishers, they were<br />fine as long as they receive the agreed tribute. But, it was not the<br />case with indian rulers. The scholars in the society took the issue<br />to the king, and ensured that either the local chief is punished or<br />warned.</p>
<p>This is what, i so far understood about our pre-british society, from<br />dharampal's book.</p>
<p>So, i could confidently say, that the wars of the west, mostly based<br />on semitic religion, which believed in believers and non-believers, is<br />entirely different from the wars of india, which was purely a conflict<br />of kingdoms.</p>
<p>There were virutes, like not attacking the unarmed, children, women,<br />etc. It was a moral code followed by almost all the kings.. And how<br />such virutes developed among all kingdoms is researchable.  </p>
<p>institutions, and as they grow, they were taught to follow dharma.</p>
<p>Its imperative, that we had our own treasure of administrative<br />policies, and there were scholars, who were proficient in it. Even in<br />wars, there were numerous tactics followed, which unfortunately were<br />undocumented and lost after britishers banned all forms of martial<br />practices in india.</p>

<p>    I remember reading a post in agathiar on marco polo account of <br />  pandya time. If I recollect correct is says that our armies went to <br />  war almost naked with just a spear n the people were not too brave ( <br />  cowards)....will try to source n put it soon.</p>
<p>    Rgds<br />    Vj</p>
<p>  this is the post from agathiar </p>
<p>  The inhabitants of the kingdom worship idols and many of them <br />  worship oxen.<br />  Under no circumstances will they eat beef, nor will they kill an <br />  ox.All the<br />  houses are smeared with cowdung.There are some people called GAVI <br />  who eat<br />  beaf but only when the cow is dead by natural causes.</p>
<p>  In this kingdom everyone including the king sits on the ground, when<br />  questiond why they do not sit a more dignified manner, they reply <br />  that it<br />  is extremely dignified to sit on the ground as we ourselves are made <br />  up of<br />  the earth and destined to return to the earth, so the earth so be<br />  respected and not to be held in contempt. There is rice but no corn <br />  in the<br />  kingdom.</p>
<p>  The men go to war with lances but completely naked.They are not in <br />  the<br />  least brave but are miserable and cowardly people.They do not kill <br />  animals<br />  but if they want to eat them they ask saracens or people of other <br />  religion<br />  to kill it for them. The men and women wash their body in water <br />  twice a<br />  day.They do not dare to eat either in the morning or in the evening <br />  without<br />  having washed first.They drink only out of their personal cup and <br />  never put<br />  to their lips but hold above their heads, pouring the wine down their<br />  throats.</p>
<p>  Tried searching for this on the net</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Volume-210.html" title="http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Volume-210.html">http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Volume-210.html</a></p>
<p>  this is the ref to south india. however am not able to trace the <br />  reference found in agathiar archives.</p>
<p>  instead find this - referene to selian and island, ruby etc point to <br />  lanka.</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Volume-29.html" title="http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Volume-29.html">http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Volume-29.html</a></p>
<p>  Now I will quit these particulars, and tell you of the most precious <br />  article that exists in the world. You must know that rubies are <br />  found in this Island and in no other country in the world but this. <br />  They find there also sapphires and topazes and amethysts, and many <br />  other stones of price. And the King of this Island possesses a ruby <br />  which is the finest and biggest in the world; I will tell you what <br />  it is like. It is about a palm in length, and as thick as a man's <br />  arm; to look at, it is the most resplendent object upon earth; it is <br />  quite free from flaw and as red as fire. Its value is so great that <br />  a price for it in money could hardly be named at all. You must know <br />  that the Great Kaan sent an embassy and begged the King as a favour <br />  greatly desired by him to sell him this ruby, offering to give for <br />  it the ransom of a city, or in fact what the King would. But the <br />  King replied that on no account whatever would he sell it, for it <br />  had come to him from his ancestors.[NOTE 5]</p>
<p>  The people of Seilan are no soldiers, but poor cowardly creatures. <br />  And when they have need of soldiers they get Saracen troops from <br />  foreign parts.</p>

<p>  Excellent Post. For the first time this long discussion made some<br />sense to me.</p>
<p>  regards,<br />  siva.</p>

<p>    Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>    That's an interesting article. But too long to read patiently.. But<br />    i did read those parts belonging to southindia and ceylon.</p>
<p>    One thing i found is that, these were essentially written by the<br />    christian travellers, where in this article, they refer to them as<br />    idoloators. There is possibility of one sided view of the european<br />    travellers. (their mentioning of cowards!!!.. .)</p>
<p>    Any way, this cannot be rejected on the whole.</p>
<p>    Secondly, I could not get how this story fits our case.</p>
<p>    But, there is lot of information from these discussions. The new<br />    info, made me to again revisit my old opinions.</p>
<p>    Ultimately, the main difference i found b/w wars of our kings, and<br />    that of the invaders is that, while it was a raja dharma, and widely<br />    accepted one, of one country invading another.. But, the societal<br />    setup was not disturbed by these wars, although, the warring class<br />    suffered heavily.. (that too was an widely accepted, as the<br />    characteristics of the kshatriyas.. )</p>
<p>    The main reference i bank on these is dharampal's books.</p>
<p>    For example, Even during the worst period of mughals, the social setup<br />    of ours were largely intact, with our pre-british educational<br />    institutions, the various settlements all across the land, the typical<br />    social setup, the educational process, where each village had basic<br />    educational facilities etc.</p>
<p>    The common people were largely indifferent to the political<br />    happenings. That's why, even when mughals dominated, our people<br />    relented in and co-existed.</p>
<p>    As swamy vivekananda says, the only time, there was mass rebellion is<br />    that, whenever there is large interference in the religious beliefs of<br />    the common people.</p>
<p>    as i said in our earlier mails, the kingdom were conglomeration of<br />    small rulers, who accepted a particular kings authority. The king<br />    largely operate from his chosen bases like capital city and other<br />    forts that he built.<br />    The daily affairs were mostly taken care of the small kings.</p>
<p>    When another king invades and defeats the present king, then the small<br />    rulers tend to accept the new king's authority, and pays tribute<br />to him.</p>
<p>    When the mughals invaded, this is what exactly happened. They<br />    initially set out for destruction of kafirs, but on seeing such vast<br />    settlements of people, and the enormous wealth, coming as tribute from<br />    numerous such small rulers, they retained the political setup, with<br />    some customization on their part.</p>
<p>    They disloged many of the big kings.</p>
<p>    But, again, whenever, there is any anti-people policies, the local<br />    rulers were sensitive to those, and they took side, to displace the<br />    present king.<br />    This happened during the moovendar eras also.. when pandiyan king is<br />    not fair, the local rulers switched side to chola to dislodge him.<br />    Because, they were directly accountable to the people then.</p>
<p>    It is this background, that when aurangazeb started large scale<br />    demolition and conversion, the local rulers, joined together, and<br />    fought back, and since the great sivaji was scoring at that time, they<br />    rallied behind him.</p>
<p>    Its the same reason, that many of the tamil kings, rallied behind<br />    vijayanagara empire, to fight against the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>    But, the greatest havoc is wrought by the britishers, who managed to<br />    collapse the entire social order. They took over numerous endowments<br />    to our indigneous educational institutions, temples, and other<br />    institutions of arts, medicine etc. They replaced our political<br />    setup, with their own. OUr local rulers were made dummy, and<br />    subvertient to collectors.</p>
<p>    The absense of the local kings to enforce dharma, and association with<br />    non-dharmic based britishers, led to degradation of many of the local<br />    rulers.<br />    This is where, you have pointed numerous leisure, and palace kings,<br />    who doesnot cared about people. Because, there was no one to punish<br />    them, for going against the people. For the britishers, they were<br />    fine as long as they receive the agreed tribute. But, it was not the<br />    case with indian rulers. The scholars in the society took the issue<br />    to the king, and ensured that either the local chief is punished or<br />    warned.</p>
<p>    This is what, i so far understood about our pre-british society, from<br />    dharampal's book.</p>
<p>    So, i could confidently say, that the wars of the west, mostly based<br />    on semitic religion, which believed in believers and non-believers, is<br />    entirely different from the wars of india, which was purely a conflict<br />    of kingdoms.</p>
<p>    There were virutes, like not attacking the unarmed, children, women,<br />    etc. It was a moral code followed by almost all the kings.. And how<br />    such virutes developed among all kingdoms is researchable.</p>
<p>    institutions, and as they grow, they were taught to follow dharma.</p>
<p>    Its imperative, that we had our own treasure of administrative<br />    policies, and there were scholars, who were proficient in it. Even in<br />    wars, there were numerous tactics followed, which unfortunately were<br />    undocumented and lost after britishers banned all forms of martial<br />    practices in india.</p>

<p>        I remember reading a post in agathiar on marco polo account of<br />      pandya time. If I recollect correct is says that our armies went to<br />      war almost naked with just a spear n the people were not too brave (<br />      cowards).... will try to source n put it soon.</p>
<p>        Rgds<br />        Vj</p>
<p>      this is the post from agathiar </p>
<p>      The inhabitants of the kingdom worship idols and many of them<br />      worship oxen.<br />      Under no circumstances will they eat beef, nor will they kill an<br />      ox.All the<br />      houses are smeared with cowdung.There are some people called GAVI<br />      who eat<br />      beaf but only when the cow is dead by natural causes.</p>
<p>      In this kingdom everyone including the king sits on the ground, when<br />      questiond why they do not sit a more dignified manner, they reply<br />      that it<br />      is extremely dignified to sit on the ground as we ourselves are made<br />      up of<br />      the earth and destined to return to the earth, so the earth so be<br />      respected and not to be held in contempt. There is rice but no corn<br />      in the<br />      kingdom.</p>
<p>      The men go to war with lances but completely naked.They are not in<br />      the<br />      least brave but are miserable and cowardly people.They do not kill<br />      animals<br />      but if they want to eat them they ask saracens or people of other<br />      religion<br />      to kill it for them. The men and women wash their body in water<br />      twice a<br />      day.They do not dare to eat either in the morning or in the evening<br />      without<br />      having washed first.They drink only out of their personal cup and<br />      never put<br />      to their lips but hold above their heads, pouring the wine down<br />their<br />      throats.</p>
<p>      Tried searching for this on the net</p>
<p>      <a href="http://www.fullbook" title="http://www.fullbook">http://www.fullbook</a> s.com/The- Travels-of- Marco-Polo-<br />Volume-210. html</p>
<p>      this is the ref to south india. however am not able to trace the<br />      reference found in agathiar archives.</p>
<p>      instead find this - referene to selian and island, ruby etc point to<br />      lanka.</p>
<p>      <a href="http://www.fullbook" title="http://www.fullbook">http://www.fullbook</a> s.com/The- Travels-of- Marco-Polo-<br />Volume-29. html</p>
<p>      Now I will quit these particulars, and tell you of the most precious<br />      article that exists in the world. You must know that rubies are<br />      found in this Island and in no other country in the world but this.<br />      They find there also sapphires and topazes and amethysts, and many<br />      other stones of price. And the King of this Island possesses a ruby<br />      which is the finest and biggest in the world; I will tell you what<br />      it is like. It is about a palm in length, and as thick as a man's<br />      arm; to look at, it is the most resplendent object upon earth; it is<br />      quite free from flaw and as red as fire. Its value is so great that<br />      a price for it in money could hardly be named at all. You must know<br />      that the Great Kaan sent an embassy and begged the King as a favour<br />      greatly desired by him to sell him this ruby, offering to give for<br />      it the ransom of a city, or in fact what the King would. But the<br />      King replied that on no account whatever would he sell it, for it<br />      had come to him from his ancestors.[NOTE 5]</p>
<p>      The people of Seilan are no soldiers, but poor cowardly creatures.<br />      And when they have need of soldiers they get Saracen troops from<br />      foreign parts.</p>

<p>    The inhabitants of the kingdom worship idols and many of them<br />    worship oxen.<br />    Under no circumstances will they eat beef, nor will they kill an<br />    ox.All the<br />    houses are smeared with cowdung.There are some people called GAVI<br />    who eat<br />    beaf but only when the cow is dead by natural causes.</p>
<p>    In this kingdom everyone including the king sits on the ground, when<br />    questiond why they do not sit a more dignified manner, they reply<br />    that it<br />    is extremely dignified to sit on the ground as we ourselves are made<br />    up of<br />    the earth and destined to return to the earth, so the earth so be<br />    respected and not to be held in contempt.

<p>    The men go to war with lances but completely naked.They are not in<br />    the<br />    least brave but are miserable and cowardly people.They do not kill<br />    animals<br />    but if they want to eat them they ask saracens or people of other<br />    religion<br />    to kill it for them. The men and women wash their body in water<br />    twice a<br />    day.They do not dare to eat either in the morning or in the evening<br />    without<br />    having washed first.They drink only out of their personal cup and<br />    never put<br />    to their lips but hold above their heads, pouring the wine down their<br />    throats.</p>

<p>    Now I will quit these particulars, and tell you of the most precious<br />    article that exists in the world. You must know that rubies are<br />    found in this Island and in no other country in the world but this.<br />    They find there also sapphires and topazes and amethysts, and many<br />    other stones of price. And the King of this Island possesses a ruby<br />    which is the finest and biggest in the world; I will tell you what<br />    it is like. It is about a palm in length, and as thick as a man's<br />    arm; to look at, it is the most resplendent object upon earth; it is<br />    quite free from flaw and as red as fire. Its value is so great that<br />    a price for it in money could hardly be named at all. You must know<br />    that the Great Kaan sent an embassy and begged the King as a favour<br />    greatly desired by him to sell him this ruby, offering to give for<br />    it the ransom of a city, or in fact what the King would. But the<br />    King replied that on no account whatever would he sell it, for it<br />    had come to him from his ancestors.[NOTE 5]</p>
<p>    The people of Seilan are no soldiers, but poor cowardly creatures.<br />    And when they have need of soldiers they get Saracen troops from<br />    foreign parts.</p>

        <p>Excellent Post. For the first time this long discussion made some sense to me.</p>
<p>regards,<br />siva.</p>
<p>On Nov 30, 2007 4:02 AM, viru <senthil_nkkl@yahoo.com  wrote:</p>

<p>  Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>  That's an interesting article. But too long to read patiently.. But<br />  i did read those parts belonging to southindia and ceylon.</p>
<p>  One thing i found is that, these were essentially written by the<br />  christian travellers, where in this article, they refer to them as<br />  idoloators. There is possibility of one sided view of the european<br />  travellers. (their mentioning of cowards!!!...)</p>
<p>  Any way, this cannot be rejected on the whole.</p>
<p>  Secondly, I could not get how this story fits our case.</p>
<p>  But, there is lot of information from these discussions. The new<br />  info, made me to again revisit my old opinions.</p>
<p>  Ultimately, the main difference i found b/w wars of our kings, and<br />  that of the invaders is that, while it was a raja dharma, and widely<br />  accepted one, of one country invading another.. But, the societal<br />  setup was not disturbed by these wars, although, the warring class<br />  suffered heavily.. (that too was an widely accepted, as the<br />  characteristics of the kshatriyas.. )</p>
<p>  The main reference i bank on these is dharampal's books.</p>
<p>  For example, Even during the worst period of mughals, the social setup<br />  of ours were largely intact, with our pre-british educational<br />  institutions, the various settlements all across the land, the typical<br />  social setup, the educational process, where each village had basic<br />  educational facilities etc.</p>
<p>  The common people were largely indifferent to the political<br />  happenings. That's why, even when mughals dominated, our people<br />  relented in and co-existed.</p>
<p>  As swamy vivekananda says, the only time, there was mass rebellion is<br />  that, whenever there is large interference in the religious beliefs of<br />  the common people.</p>
<p>  as i said in our earlier mails, the kingdom were conglomeration of<br />  small rulers, who accepted a particular kings authority. The king<br />  largely operate from his chosen bases like capital city and other<br />  forts that he built.<br />  The daily affairs were mostly taken care of the small kings.</p>
<p>  When another king invades and defeats the present king, then the small<br />  rulers tend to accept the new king's authority, and pays tribute to him.</p>
<p>  When the mughals invaded, this is what exactly happened. They<br />  initially set out for destruction of kafirs, but on seeing such vast<br />  settlements of people, and the enormous wealth, coming as tribute from<br />  numerous such small rulers, they retained the political setup, with<br />  some customization on their part.</p>
<p>  They disloged many of the big kings.</p>
<p>  But, again, whenever, there is any anti-people policies, the local<br />  rulers were sensitive to those, and they took side, to displace the<br />  present king.<br />  This happened during the moovendar eras also.. when pandiyan king is<br />  not fair, the local rulers switched side to chola to dislodge him.<br />  Because, they were directly accountable to the people then.</p>
<p>  It is this background, that when aurangazeb started large scale<br />  demolition and conversion, the local rulers, joined together, and<br />  fought back, and since the great sivaji was scoring at that time, they<br />  rallied behind him.</p>
<p>  Its the same reason, that many of the tamil kings, rallied behind<br />  vijayanagara empire, to fight against the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>  But, the greatest havoc is wrought by the britishers, who managed to<br />  collapse the entire social order. They took over numerous endowments<br />  to our indigneous educational institutions, temples, and other<br />  institutions of arts, medicine etc. They replaced our political<br />  setup, with their own. OUr local rulers were made dummy, and<br />  subvertient to collectors.</p>
<p>  The absense of the local kings to enforce dharma, and association with<br />  non-dharmic based britishers, led to degradation of many of the local<br />  rulers.<br />  This is where, you have pointed numerous leisure, and palace kings,<br />  who doesnot cared about people. Because, there was no one to punish<br />  them, for going against the people. For the britishers, they were<br />  fine as long as they receive the agreed tribute. But, it was not the<br />  case with indian rulers. The scholars in the society took the issue<br />  to the king, and ensured that either the local chief is punished or<br />  warned.</p>
<p>  This is what, i so far understood about our pre-british society, from<br />  dharampal's book.</p>
<p>  So, i could confidently say, that the wars of the west, mostly based<br />  on semitic religion, which believed in believers and non-believers, is<br />  entirely different from the wars of india, which was purely a conflict<br />  of kingdoms.</p>
<p>  There were virutes, like not attacking the unarmed, children, women,<br />  etc. It was a moral code followed by almost all the kings.. And how<br />  such virutes developed among all kingdoms is researchable.</p>
<p>  institutions, and as they grow, they were taught to follow dharma.</p>
<p>  Its imperative, that we had our own treasure of administrative<br />  policies, and there were scholars, who were proficient in it. Even in<br />  wars, there were numerous tactics followed, which unfortunately were<br />  undocumented and lost after britishers banned all forms of martial<br />  practices in india.</p>
