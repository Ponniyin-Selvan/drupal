</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>A very nice article which I hope resonates with people here.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>
<p>  A couple of years ago I received a letter from an American soldier in<br />Iraq. The letter began by saying that, as we've all become painfully aware,<br />serving on the front lines is physically exhausting and emotionally<br />debilitating. But the reason for his writing was to tell me that in that<br />hostile and lonely environment, a book I'd written had become a kind of<br />lifeline. As the book is about science – one that traces physicists' search<br />for nature's deepest laws – the soldiers' letter might strike you as, well,<br />odd.</p>
<p>  But it's not. Rather it speaks to the powerful role science can play in<br />giving life context and meaning. At the same time, the soldier's letter<br />emphasized something I've increasingly come to believe: America's<br />educational system fails to teach science in a way that allows students to<br />integrate it into their lives. When we consider the ubiquity of cell phones,<br />iPods, personal computers on the Internet, it's easy to see how science is<br />woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit from MRI<br />devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately appreciate how<br />science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the<br />world and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics,<br />security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to<br />science to gauge the problems and find solutions.</p>
<p>  And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hoverig on the horizon –<br />stem cells, genomic sequencing, longevity research, nanoscience, quantum<br />computers, space technology – we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a<br />general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no<br />other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions<br />on a range of issues that will shape the future.</p>
<p>  These are the standard reasons many would give in explaining why science<br />matters.<br />But the reason science can really matters runs deeper still. Science is a<br />way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process that takes us<br />from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, predictive and<br />reliable – a transformation, for those lucky enough to experience it, that<br />is empowering and emotional. To be able to think through and grasp<br />explanations – for everything from why the sky is blue to how life formed on<br />earth – not because they are declared dogma but rather because they reveal<br />patterns confirmed by experiment and observation, is one of the most<br />precious of human experiences. As a practicing scientist, I know this from<br />my own work and study.</p>
<p>  But I also know that you don't have to be a scientist for science to be<br />transformative. I've seen children's eyes light up as I've told them about<br />black holes and the big bang. I've spoken with high school dropouts who've<br />stumbled on popular science books about the human genome project, and then<br />returned to school with new-found purpose.</p>
<p>  And in that letter from Iraq, the soldier told me how learning about<br />relativity and quantum physics in the dusty and dangerous environs of<br />greater Baghdad kept him going because it revealed a deeper reality of which<br />we're all a part.</p>
<p>  It's striking that science is still widely viewed as an isolated body of<br />largely esoteric knowledge that sometimes shows up in the "real" world in<br />the form of technological or medical advances. In reality, science is a<br />language of hope and inspiration, providing discoveries that instill a sense<br />of connection to our lives and our world.</p>
<p>  I've spoken with so many people over the years whose encounters with<br />science in school left them thinking of it as cold, distant and<br />intimidating. What a shame. Like a life without music, art or literature, a<br />life without science is bereft of something that gives experience a rich and<br />otherwise inaccessible dimension.</p>
<p>  It's one thing to go outside on a crisp, clear night and marvel at a sky<br />full of stars. It's another to marvel not only at the spectacle but to<br />recognize that those stars are the results of exceedingly ordered conditions<br />13.7 billion years ago at the moment of the big bang. It's another still to<br />understand how those stars act as nuclear furnaces that supply the universe<br />with carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, the raw material of life as we know it.</p>
<p>  And it's yet another level of experience to realize that those stars<br />account for less than 4 percent of what's out there – the rest being of an<br />unknown composition, so-called dark matter and energy, which researchers are<br />now trying to divine.</p>
<p>  As every parent knows, children begin life as uninhibited, unabashed<br />explorers of the unknown. From the time we can walk and talk, we want to<br />know what things are and how they work – we begin life as little scientists.<br />But most of us quickly lose our intrinsic scientific passion. And it's a<br />profound loss. A great many studies have focused on this problem,<br />identifying important opportunities for improving science education.<br />Recommendations have ranged from increasing the level of training for<br />science teachers to curriculum reforms.</p>
<p>  But most of these studies avoid an overarching systemic issue: In teaching<br />students, we continually fail to activate rich opportunities for revealing<br />the breathtaking vistas opened up by science, and instead focus on the need<br />to gain competency with science's underlying technical details.</p>
<p>  In fact, many students I've spoken to have little sense of the big<br />questions those technical details collectively try to answer: Where did the<br />universe come from? How did life originate? How does the brain give rise to<br />consciousness? Like a music curriculum that requires its students to<br />practice scales while rarely if ever inspiring them by playing the great<br />masterpieces, this way of teaching science squanders the chance to make<br />students sit up in their chairs and say, "Wow, that's science?".</p>
<p>  In physics, just to give a sense of the raw material that's available to<br />be leveraged, the most revolutionary of advances have happened in the last<br />100 years – special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics – a<br />symphony of discoveries that changed our conception of reality. More<br />recently, the last 10 years have witnessed an upheaval in our understanding<br />of the universe's composition, yielding a wholly new prediction for what the<br />cosmos will be like in the far future These are paradigm-shaking<br />developments. But rare is the high school class in which these breakthroughs<br />are introduced. It's much the same story in classes for biology, chemistry<br />and mathematics.</p>
<p>  At the root of this pedagogical approach is a firm belief in the vertical<br />nature of science: You must master A before moving on to B. Certainly, when<br />it comes to teaching the technicalities – solving this equation, balancing<br />the reaction, grasping the discrete parts of the cell – the verticality of<br />science is unassailable. But science is so much more than its technical<br />details. And with careful attention to presentation, cutting-edge insights<br />and discoveries can be clearly and faithfully communicated to students<br />independent of those details; in fact, those insights and discoveries are<br />precisely the ones that can drive a young student to want to learn the<br />details. We rob science education of life when we focus solely on results<br />and seek to train students to solve problems and recite facts without a<br />commensurate emphasis on transporting them out beyond the stars.</p>
<p>  Science is the greatest of all adventure stories, one that's been<br />unfolding for thousand of years. Science needs to be taught to the young and<br />communicated to the mature in a manner that captures this drama. We must<br />embark on a cultural shift that places science in its rightful place<br />alongside music, art and literature as an indispensable part of what makes<br />life worth living.</p>
<p>  It's the birthright of every child, it's a necessity for every adult, to<br />look out on the world, as the soldier in Iraq did, and see that the wonder<br />of the cosmos transcends everything that divides us.</p>

        <p>TIMES OF INDIA (CHENNAI) reported today.</p>
<p>New Science makes invisible come alive.</p>
<p>Metagenomics is the study of the genomes - the DNA coes ...</p>
<p>A Scientific Dilemma...</p>
<p>only 1% bacteria have ever been studied because just a few can be <br />grown in culture dishes...</p>

<p>  Well Malathi, you asked why do we need a God ( appo appo <br />Dasavatharam <br />  Govind mathiri pesaringa..lol), we dont, yet we do. A guy in remote <br />  polar circle thinks that there are no cars in the world, it is not <br />  essentially right. Does he need one - No! Do we need one - Yes! Do <br />  cars exist - Yes!</p>
<p>  I read some one's note on Chaos theory, that is actually how Karma <br />  works, you have individual Karma, collective Karma etc. Karma acts <br />on <br />  pure sequence, not just like 1.2..3...etc, rather as 1,1.1,1.11 so <br />on <br />  till 2. It is like explaining Jet dynamics to a 1st grader. </p>
<p>  Like I said earlier, i believe, we will be proven our ignorance as <br />the <br />  universe unfolds itself. All that is to be seen tomorrow, already <br />  exists. We just use the keyword science to define our new found <br />toys.<br />  Science is like a pinch of salt on a huge buffet spread standing <br />  against 1/2 foot stomach.</p>

<p>        Understanding Cosmic<br />        Laws<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/2008/ <br />11/understanding -<br />    cosmic-<br />      laws.html </http://nithyaevents></p>
<p>        Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we <br />can <br />      explain<br />        scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind <br />either <br />    as<br />        something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude <br />    that <br />      can not<br />        be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>        It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a <br />      miracle if it<br />        provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a <br />      catastrophe; a<br />        yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors <br />has <br />      performed a<br />        miracle.</p>
<p>        In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents <br />and <br />    our<br />        inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents <br />and <br />      what we<br />        understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort <br />    and <br />      confusion.<br />        Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' <br />is <br />      either<br />        barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>        There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet <br />      understand the<br />        laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to <br />defy<br />        'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe <br />    supports <br />      laws that<br />        go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far <br />    discovered <br />      by<br />        humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages <br />    behind <br />      many of<br />        these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding <br />and <br />      appreciating<br />        the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>        Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They <br />have <br />      discovered<br />        that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one <br />galaxy <br />      another star<br />        system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe, <br />      perhaps in<br />        another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction <br />some <br />      where in the<br />        universe.</p>
<p>        Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to <br />be<br />        proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly <br />      fluttering its<br />        wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, <br />not <br />      imagination.</p>
<p>        Matter and energy were totally different entities till <br />Einstein <br />      established<br />        their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or <br />    energy, <br />      never<br />        both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the <br />      principle of<br />        'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist <br />    simultaneously <br />      in a<br />        common time and space framework has been <br />    understood. 'Singularity' <br />      is the<br />        common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we <br />    call <br />      Brahman.</p>
<p>        Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know <br />    how. <br />      With<br />        thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to <br />flit <br />    from <br />      one zone<br />        to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to <br />ground <br />      ourselves<br />        in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future <br />and <br />      the past; a<br />        future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty <br />about. <br />      Thoughts<br />        are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts <br />we <br />      can never<br />        hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>        We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future <br />    and <br />      the past.<br />        We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, <br />in <br />      the here<br />        and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon <br />    the <br />      present<br />        moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts <br />gradually <br />      disappear.<br />        When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability <br />to <br />      transcend<br />        time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able <br />to <br />      traverse<br />        past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and <br />space. <br />    We <br />      then<br />        start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>        Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We <br />then <br />      start to<br />        understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no <br />    longer <br />      miracles<br />        but a natural flow of the universe.<br />        Master<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/search/ <br />label/Words% <br />    20From%<br />      20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents></p>

<p>    I forgot this. Actually the answer for the shape is very much <br />  within the same pAsuram that I have quoted below.</p>
<p>    "pENungAl peNum uruvAgum"...... Means whichever way you(we) think <br />  of God He is like that for you (us).  </p>
<p>    And Azhwar goes further to say "allanumAm!!". Means "someone <br />  says He does not exist". See the exclamatory <br />  expression "allanumAm". </p>

<p>    Ravi,</p>
<p>    It is He and not She. Again let me quote Nammazhwar,</p>
<p>    ANallan, peNNallan, allA-aliyum allan,<br />    kANalum AgAn, uLan-allan, illai-allan<br />    pENungAl peNum uruvAgum, allanumAm<br />    kONai peridhuDaitthu em pemmAnaik kURudhalE</p>
<p>    Azhwar goes on to say that He is neither male nor female nor a <br />  eunuch.  But Wait!!! Azhwar says "He" is not  male?? Then how do <br />  we say that the God is a male? The clue is in the pAsuram itself. <br />  Azhwar says "ANallan" "peNNallan" "aliyum allan". Note the "an" <br />  vigudhi. This is used only to denote a male. So what is this <br />  confusion... .. one may ask. Here it goes. He (God) is not a normal <br />  male or female or eunuch. But He is the "Omnipotent Male". He is <br />  apart from this "prakruthi". He is Purushotthaman. </p>
<p>    Regarding the shape of the God...... I have said this before. He <br />  presents Himself in whichever form we wish to visualize Him. I am <br />  not elaborating on this as we have already discussed enough on <br />these <br />  lines.</p>
<p>    And Karma theory...... . a very complicated one. </p>
<p>    Nammazhwar says " karumamum karuma-palanum Agiya kAraNan". That, <br />  God Himself is your Karma and the fruit of it. This is a very <br />  subtle subject. Yes, I have told about this BommalAttam analogy <br />  before. He makes us act (Karma) according to His wish (Sankalpa) for <br />  His pleasure (Fruit of Karma). So the both the act and the fruit as <br />  His'. But what we see as ours is only due to the "agnyAnam" that <br />  prevails with us. </p>
<p>    And many of us will not come to terms easily with this as the <br />  questions and doubts that arise will be more to confuse than to <br />  clarify. <br />     <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Who is He? Is it not a She? Well if it was a She, then was it not <br />  an <br />    IT ? If it was an It, was there any shape? If there was a shape is <br />  it <br />    restricted ? If it is not restricted, where is It then?</p>
<p>    Well Malathi, you asked why do we need a God ( appo appo <br />  Dasavatharam <br />    Govind mathiri pesaringa..lol) , we dont, yet we do. A guy in <br />  remote <br />    polar circle thinks that there are no cars in the world, it is not <br />    essentially right. Does he need one - No! Do we need one - Yes! Do <br />    cars exist - Yes!</p>
<p>    I read some one's note on Chaos theory, that is actually how Karma <br />    works, you have individual Karma, collective Karma etc. Karma acts <br />  on <br />    pure sequence, not just like 1.2..3...etc, rather as 1,1.1,1.11 so <br />  on <br />    till 2. It is like explaining Jet dynamics to a 1st grader. </p>
<p>    Like I said earlier, i believe, we will be proven our ignorance as <br />  the <br />    universe unfolds itself. All that is to be seen tomorrow, already <br />    exists. We just use the keyword science to define our new found <br />  toys.<br />    Science is like a pinch of salt on a huge buffet spread standing <br />    against 1/2 foot stomach.</p>

<p>          Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we <br />  can <br />        explain<br />          scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind <br />  either <br />      as<br />          something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a <br />magnitude <br />      that <br />        can not<br />          be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>          It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a <br />        miracle if it<br />          provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a <br />        catastrophe; a<br />          yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors <br />  has <br />        performed a<br />          miracle.</p>
<p>          In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents <br />  and <br />      our<br />          inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents <br />  and <br />        what we<br />          understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, <br />discomfort <br />      and <br />        confusion.<br />          Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' <br />  is <br />        either<br />          barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>          There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet <br />        understand the<br />          laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to <br />  defy<br />          'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe <br />      supports <br />        laws that<br />          go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far <br />      discovered <br />        by<br />          humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages <br />      behind <br />        many of<br />          these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding <br />  and <br />        appreciating<br />          the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>          Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They <br />  have <br />        discovered<br />          that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one <br />  galaxy <br />        another star<br />          system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe, <br />        perhaps in<br />          another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction <br />  some <br />        where in the<br />          universe.</p>
<p>          Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need <br />to <br />  be<br />          proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly <br />        fluttering its<br />          wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, <br />  not <br />        imagination.</p>
<p>          Matter and energy were totally different entities till <br />  Einstein <br />        established<br />          their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or <br />      energy, <br />        never<br />          both in the same time and space. It is only recently that <br />the <br />        principle of<br />          'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist <br />      simultaneously <br />        in a<br />          common time and space framework has been <br />      understood. 'Singularity' <br />        is the<br />          common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that <br />we <br />      call <br />        Brahman.</p>
<p>          Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know <br />      how. <br />        With<br />          thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to <br />  flit <br />      from <br />        one zone<br />          to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to <br />  ground <br />        ourselves<br />          in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future <br />  and <br />        the past; a<br />          future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty <br />  about. <br />        Thoughts<br />          are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through <br />thoughts <br />  we <br />        can never<br />          hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>          We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the <br />future <br />      and <br />        the past.<br />          We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the <br />present, <br />  in <br />        the here<br />          and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus <br />upon <br />      the <br />        present<br />          moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts <br />  gradually <br />        disappear.<br />          When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability <br />  to <br />        transcend<br />          time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are <br />able <br />  to <br />        traverse<br />          past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and <br />  space. <br />      We <br />        then<br />          start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>          Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We <br />  then <br />        start to<br />          understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no <br />      longer <br />        miracles<br />          but a natural flow of the universe.<br />          Master<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/search/ <br />  label/Words% <br />      20From%<br />        20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents></p>

        <p>Beautiful!! Also in the Ramayana there is a rishi by name Jabala who <br />argues athiesm with Sri Rama himself. Jabala was the original EVR :))<br />just kidding but it was not considered unusual even in those days. We <br />have to be proud of such a religion that supports so much open <br />mindedness.</p>

<p>  Ravi,</p>
<p>  It is He and not She. Again let me quote Nammazhwar,</p>
<p>  ANallan, peNNallan, allA-aliyum allan,<br />  kANalum AgAn, uLan-allan, illai-allan<br />  pENungAl peNum uruvAgum, allanumAm<br />  kONai peridhuDaitthu em pemmAnaik kURudhalE</p>
<p>  Azhwar goes on to say that He is neither male nor female nor a <br />eunuch.  But Wait!!! Azhwar says "He" is not  male?? Then how do </p></blockquote>
<p>we say that the God is a male? The clue is in the pAsuram itself. <br />Azhwar says "ANallan" "peNNallan" "aliyum allan". Note the "an" <br />vigudhi. This is used only to denote a male. So what is this <br />confusion... .. one may ask. Here it goes. He (God) is not a normal <br />male or female or eunuch. But He is the "Omnipotent Male". He is <br />apart from this "prakruthi". He is Purushotthaman. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Regarding the shape of the God...... I have said this before. He <br />presents Himself in whichever form we wish to visualize Him. I am </p></blockquote>
<p>not elaborating on this as we have already discussed enough on these <br />lines.</p>
<blockquote><p>  And Karma theory...... . a very complicated one. </p>
<p>  Nammazhwar says " karumamum karuma-palanum Agiya kAraNan". That, <br />God Himself is your Karma and the fruit of it. This is a very </p></blockquote>
<p>subtle subject. Yes, I have told about this BommalAttam analogy <br />before. He makes us act (Karma) according to His wish (Sankalpa) for <br />His pleasure (Fruit of Karma). So the both the act and the fruit as <br />His'. But what we see as ours is only due to the "agnyAnam" that <br />prevails with us. </p>

<p>  Who is He? Is it not a She? Well if it was a She, then was it not <br />an <br />  IT ? If it was an It, was there any shape? If there was a shape is <br />it <br />  restricted ? If it is not restricted, where is It then?</p>
<p>  Well Malathi, you asked why do we need a God ( appo appo <br />Dasavatharam <br />  Govind mathiri pesaringa..lol) , we dont, yet we do. A guy in <br />remote <br />  polar circle thinks that there are no cars in the world, it is not <br />  essentially right. Does he need one - No! Do we need one - Yes! Do <br />  cars exist - Yes!</p>
<p>  I read some one's note on Chaos theory, that is actually how Karma <br />  works, you have individual Karma, collective Karma etc. Karma acts <br />on <br />  pure sequence, not just like 1.2..3...etc, rather as 1,1.1,1.11 so <br />on <br />  till 2. It is like explaining Jet dynamics to a 1st grader. </p>
<p>  Like I said earlier, i believe, we will be proven our ignorance as <br />the <br />  universe unfolds itself. All that is to be seen tomorrow, already <br />  exists. We just use the keyword science to define our new found <br />toys.<br />  Science is like a pinch of salt on a huge buffet spread standing <br />  against 1/2 foot stomach.</p>

<p>        Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we <br />can <br />      explain<br />        scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind <br />either <br />    as<br />        something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude <br />    that <br />      can not<br />        be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>        It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a <br />      miracle if it<br />        provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a <br />      catastrophe; a<br />        yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors <br />has <br />      performed a<br />        miracle.</p>
<p>        In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents <br />and <br />    our<br />        inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents <br />and <br />      what we<br />        understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort <br />    and <br />      confusion.<br />        Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' <br />is <br />      either<br />        barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>        There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet <br />      understand the<br />        laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to <br />defy<br />        'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe <br />    supports <br />      laws that<br />        go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far <br />    discovered <br />      by<br />        humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages <br />    behind <br />      many of<br />        these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding <br />and <br />      appreciating<br />        the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>        Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They <br />have <br />      discovered<br />        that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one <br />galaxy <br />      another star<br />        system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe, <br />      perhaps in<br />        another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction <br />some <br />      where in the<br />        universe.</p>
<p>        Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to <br />be<br />        proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly <br />      fluttering its<br />        wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, <br />not <br />      imagination.</p>
<p>        Matter and energy were totally different entities till <br />Einstein <br />      established<br />        their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or <br />    energy, <br />      never<br />        both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the <br />      principle of<br />        'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist <br />    simultaneously <br />      in a<br />        common time and space framework has been <br />    understood. 'Singularity' <br />      is the<br />        common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we <br />    call <br />      Brahman.</p>
<p>        Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know <br />    how. <br />      With<br />        thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to <br />flit <br />    from <br />      one zone<br />        to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to <br />ground <br />      ourselves<br />        in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future <br />and <br />      the past; a<br />        future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty <br />about. <br />      Thoughts<br />        are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts <br />we <br />      can never<br />        hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>        We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future <br />    and <br />      the past.<br />        We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, <br />in <br />      the here<br />        and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon <br />    the <br />      present<br />        moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts <br />gradually <br />      disappear.<br />        When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability <br />to <br />      transcend<br />        time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able <br />to <br />      traverse<br />        past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and <br />space. <br />    We <br />      then<br />        start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>        Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We <br />then <br />      start to<br />        understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no <br />    longer <br />      miracles<br />        but a natural flow of the universe.<br />        Master<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/search/ <br />label/Words% <br />    20From%<br />      20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents></p>

<p>Very much yes. Very apt reference. In fact Nammazhwar says that He is present as the Supreme God in all religions exactly in the same way like the electricity analogy or the pAl-thayir analogy.</p>

        <p>While we are on this subject, below are some quotes of one of the greatest<br />scientists - Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>And, on the subject of astrology, are the astrological<br />references/predictions in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RC</acronym 's birth, birth marks etc factual?<br />Anybody?</acronym></p>
<p>Regards<br />Sandeep</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>In the view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human<br />mind, am able to recognise, there are yet people who say there is no God.<br />But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for support for such<br />views. (The Expanded Quotable Einstein, Princeton University Press, p. 214)</p>
<p>What separates me from most so-called atheists is a feeling of utter<br />humility toward the unattainable secrets of the harmony of the cosmos.<br />(Albert Einstein to Joseph Lewis, Apr. 18, 1953)<br />The area of scientific knowledge has been enormously extended, and<br />theoretical knowledge has become vastly more profound in every department of<br />science. But the assimilative power of the human intellect is and remains<br />strictly limited. Hence it was inevitable that the activity of the<br />individual investigator should be confined to a smaller and smaller section<br />of human knowledge. Worse still, this specialization makes it increasingly<br />difficult to keep even our general understanding of science as a whole,<br />without which the true spirit of research is inevitably handicapped, in step<br />with scientific progress. Every serious scientific worker is painfully<br />conscious of this involuntary relegation to an ever-narrowing sphere of<br />knowledge, which threatens to deprive the investigator of his broad horizon<br />and degrades him to the level of a mechanic ...<br />It is just as important to make knowledge live and to keep it alive as to<br />solve specific problems. (Albert Einstein, 1954)</p>
<p>The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend<br />personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the<br />spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the<br />experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity.<br />Buddhism answers this description .. If there is any religion that could<br />cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism. (Albert Einstein)</p>
<p>In my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken<br />this religious feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it.<br />(Albert Einstein, 1930)</p>
<p>A human being is part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in<br />time and space. We experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as<br />something separate from the rest. A kind of optical delusion of<br />consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to<br />our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our<br />task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of<br />compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its<br />beauty. The true value of a human being is determined by the measure and the<br />sense in which they have obtained *liberation from the self.* We shall<br />require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to<br />survive. (*Albert<br />Einstein*, 1954)<br />I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a<br />childlike one, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional<br />atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the<br />fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude<br />of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding<br />of nature and of our own being. (Albert Einstein)</p>
<p>I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or<br />that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know his<br />thoughts. The rest are details. (The Expanded Quotable Einstein, Princeton<br />University Press, 2000 p.202)</p>
<p>It is very difficult to elucidate this [cosmic religious] feeling to anyone<br />who is entirely without it. . . The religious geniuses of all ages have been<br />distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no<br />God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose central<br />teachings are based on it ... In my view, it is the most important function<br />of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are<br />receptive to it. (The Expanded Quotable Einstein, Princeton University<br />Press, p. 207)</p>

<p>      Understanding Cosmic<br />      Laws<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/2008/ 11/understanding -<br />  cosmic-<br />    laws.html </http://nithyaevents></p>
<p>      Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we can<br />    explain<br />      scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind either<br />  as<br />      something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude<br />  that<br />    can not<br />      be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>      It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a<br />    miracle if it<br />      provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a<br />    catastrophe; a<br />      yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors has<br />    performed a<br />      miracle.</p>
<p>      In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents and<br />  our<br />      inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents and<br />    what we<br />      understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort and<br />    confusion.<br />      Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' is<br />    either<br />      barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>      There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet<br />    understand the<br />      laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to defy<br />      'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe supports<br />    laws that<br />      go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far<br />  discovered<br />    by<br />      humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages<br />  behind<br />    many of<br />      these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding and<br />    appreciating<br />      the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>      Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They have<br />    discovered<br />      that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one galaxy<br />    another star<br />      system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe,<br />    perhaps in<br />      another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction some<br />    where in the<br />      universe.</p>
<p>      Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to be<br />      proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly<br />    fluttering its<br />      wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, not<br />    imagination.</p>
<p>      Matter and energy were totally different entities till Einstein<br />    established<br />      their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or<br />  energy,<br />    never<br />      both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the<br />    principle of<br />      'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist<br />  simultaneously<br />    in a<br />      common time and space framework has been<br />  understood. 'Singularity'<br />    is the<br />      common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we<br />  call<br />    Brahman.</p>
<p>      Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know how.<br />    With<br />      thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to flit<br />  from<br />    one zone<br />      to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to ground<br />    ourselves<br />      in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future and<br />    the past; a<br />      future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty about.<br />    Thoughts<br />      are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts we<br />    can never<br />      hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>      We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future and<br />    the past.<br />      We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, in<br />    the here<br />      and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon the<br />    present<br />      moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts gradually<br />    disappear.<br />      When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability to<br />    transcend<br />      time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able to<br />    traverse<br />      past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and space.<br />  We<br />    then<br />      start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>      Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We then<br />    start to<br />      understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no<br />  longer<br />    miracles<br />      but a natural flow of the universe.<br />      Master<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/search/ label/Words%<br />  20From%<br />    20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents></p>

        <p>Ravi,</p>
<p>I forgot this. Actually the answer for the shape is very much within the same pAsuram that I have quoted below.</p>
<p>"pENungAl peNum uruvAgum"...... Means whichever way you(we) think of God Heis like that for you (us).  </p>
<p>And Azhwar goes further to say "allanumAm!!". Means "someonesays He does not exist". See the exclamatory expression "allanumAm". </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>
<p>________________________________<br />From: Thirumalai Vinjamoor Venkatesh <vinjamoor_venkatesh@yahoo.com <br />To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />Sent: Thursday, 13 November, 2008 1:26:33 PM<br />Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] Re: On the beauty of science</vinjamoor_venkatesh@yahoo.com></p>
<p>Ravi,</p>
<p>It is He and not She. Again let me quote Nammazhwar,</p>
<p>ANallan, peNNallan, allA-aliyum allan,<br />kANalum AgAn, uLan-allan, illai-allan<br />pENungAl peNum uruvAgum, allanumAm<br />kONai peridhuDaitthu em pemmAnaik kURudhalE</p>
<p>Azhwar goes on to say that He is neither male nor female nor a eunuch.  But Wait!!! Azhwar says "He" is not  male?? Then how do we say that the God is a male? The clue is in the pAsuram itself. Azhwar says "ANallan" "peNNallan" "aliyum allan". Note the "an" vigudhi. This is used only to denote a male. So what is this confusion... .. one may ask. Here it goes. He (God) is not a normal male or female or eunuch. But He is the "Omnipotent Male". He is apart from this "prakruthi". He is Purushotthaman. </p>
<p>Regarding the shape of the God...... I have said this before. He presents Himself in whichever form we wish to visualize Him. I am not elaborating on this as we have already discussed enough on these lines.</p>
<p>And Karma theory...... . a very complicated one. </p>
<p>Nammazhwar says " karumamum karuma-palanum Agiya kAraNan". That, God Himself is your Karma and the fruit of it. This is a very subtle subject. Yes, I have told about this BommalAttam analogy before. He makes us act (Karma) according to His wish (Sankalpa) for His pleasure (Fruit of Karma). So the both the act and the fruit as His'. But what we see as ours is only due to the "agnyAnam" that prevails with us. </p>
<p>And many of us will not come to terms easily with this as the questions and doubts that arise will be more to confuse than to clarify. <br /> <br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>Who is He? Is it not a She? Well if it was a She, then was it not an <br />IT ? If it was an It, was there any shape? If there was a shape is it <br />restricted ? If it is not restricted, where is It then?</p>
<p>Well Malathi, you asked why do we need a God ( appo appo Dasavatharam <br />Govind mathiri pesaringa..lol) , we dont, yet we do. A guy in remote <br />polar circle thinks that there are no cars in the world, it is not <br />essentially right. Does he need one - No! Do we need one - Yes! Do <br />cars exist - Yes!</p>
<p>I read some one's note on Chaos theory, that is actually how Karma <br />works, you have individual Karma, collective Karma etc. Karma acts on <br />pure sequence, not just like 1.2..3...etc, rather as 1,1.1,1.11 so on <br />till 2. It is like explaining Jet dynamics to a 1st grader. </p>
<p>Like I said earlier, i believe, we will be proven our ignorance as the <br />universe unfolds itself. All that is to be seen tomorrow, already <br />exists. We just use the keyword science to define our new found toys.<br />Science is like a pinch of salt on a huge buffet spread standing <br />against 1/2 foot stomach.</p>

<p>The parental model of God is similar to the white bearded punishment <br />oriented authoritatian male God of abrahamic religion who has <br />frustrated many people including scientists and thinkers. The model <br />of universal energy and oneness that our spiritual heritage has is <br />much more tolerant, experiential and accepting than that. </p>
<p>It is only by facing and asking the challenging questions we need to <br />ask ourselves that we learn the value and true meaning of the <br />universal spirit, not by avoiding them.</p>

        <p>Perfect Atpu,</p>
<p>It is just like Electricity is in a wire. You feel it when you touch it uninsulated. This insulation is our "agnyAna". While in this worldy logic, the Insulation has to be present, its presence as a metaphor to "agnyAna" has to be gotten rid of to experience God. </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Ravi,</p>
<p>It is He and not She. Again let me quote Nammazhwar,</p>
<p>ANallan, peNNallan, allA-aliyum allan,<br />kANalum AgAn, uLan-allan, illai-allan<br />pENungAl peNum uruvAgum, allanumAm<br />kONai peridhuDaitthu em pemmAnaik kURudhalE</p>
<p>Azhwar goes on to say that He is neither male nor female nor a eunuch.  But Wait!!! Azhwar says "He" is not  male?? Then how do we say that the God is a male? The clue is in the pAsuram itself. Azhwar says "ANallan" "peNNallan" "aliyum allan". Note the "an" vigudhi. This is used only to denote a male. So what is this confusion..... one may ask. Here it goes. He (God) is not a normal male or femaleor eunuch. But He is the "Omnipotent Male". He is apart from this "prakruthi". He is Purushotthaman. </p>
<p>Regarding the shape of the God...... I have said this before. He presents Himself in whichever form we wish to visualize Him. I am not elaborating on this as we have already discussed enough on these lines.</p>
<p>And Karma theory....... a very complicated one. </p>
<p>Nammazhwar says " karumamum karuma-palanum Agiya kAraNan". That, God Himself is your Karma and the fruit of it. This is a very subtle subject. Yes, I have told about this BommalAttam analogy before. He makes us act (Karma) according to His wish (Sankalpa) for His pleasure (Fruit of Karma). So the both the act and the fruit as His'. But what we see as ours is only due to the "agnyAnam" that prevails with us. </p>
<p>And many of us will not come to terms easily with this as the questions and doubts that arise will be more to confuse than to clarify. <br /> <br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>Who is He? Is it not a She? Well if it was a She, then was it not an <br />IT ? If it was an It, was there any shape? If there was a shape is it <br />restricted ? If it is not restricted, where is It then?</p>
<p>Well Malathi, you asked why do we need a God ( appo appo Dasavatharam <br />Govind mathiri pesaringa..lol) , we dont, yet we do. A guy in remote <br />polar circle thinks that there are no cars in the world, it is not <br />essentially right. Does he need one - No! Do we need one - Yes! Do <br />cars exist - Yes!</p>
<p>I read some one's note on Chaos theory, that is actually how Karma <br />works, you have individual Karma, collective Karma etc. Karma acts on <br />pure sequence, not just like 1.2..3...etc, rather as 1,1.1,1.11 so on <br />till 2. It is like explaining Jet dynamics to a 1st grader. </p>
<p>Like I said earlier, i believe, we will be proven our ignorance as the <br />universe unfolds itself. All that is to be seen tomorrow, already <br />exists. We just use the keyword science to define our new found toys.<br />Science is like a pinch of salt on a huge buffet spread standing <br />against 1/2 foot stomach.</p>

<p>      Understanding Cosmic<br />      Laws<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/2008/ 11/understanding -<br />  cosmic-<br />    laws.html </http://nithyaevents></p>
<p>      Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we can <br />    explain<br />      scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind either <br />  as<br />      something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude <br />  that <br />    can not<br />      be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>      It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a <br />    miracle if it<br />      provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a <br />    catastrophe; a<br />      yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors has <br />    performed a<br />      miracle.</p>
<p>      In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents and <br />  our<br />      inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents and <br />    what we<br />      understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort <br />  and <br />    confusion.<br />      Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' is <br />    either<br />      barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>      There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet <br />    understand the<br />      laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to defy<br />      'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe <br />  supports <br />    laws that<br />      go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far <br />  discovered <br />    by<br />      humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages <br />  behind <br />    many of<br />      these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding and <br />    appreciating<br />      the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>      Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They have <br />    discovered<br />      that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one galaxy <br />    another star<br />      system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe, <br />    perhaps in<br />      another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction some <br />    where in the<br />      universe.</p>
<p>      Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to be<br />      proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly <br />    fluttering its<br />      wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, not <br />    imagination.</p>
<p>      Matter and energy were totally different entities till Einstein <br />    established<br />      their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or <br />  energy, <br />    never<br />      both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the <br />    principle of<br />      'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist <br />  simultaneously <br />    in a<br />      common time and space framework has been <br />  understood. 'Singularity' <br />    is the<br />      common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we <br />  call <br />    Brahman.</p>
<p>      Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know <br />  how. <br />    With<br />      thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to flit <br />  from <br />    one zone<br />      to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to ground <br />    ourselves<br />      in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future and <br />    the past; a<br />      future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty about. <br />    Thoughts<br />      are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts we <br />    can never<br />      hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>      We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future <br />  and <br />    the past.<br />      We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, in <br />    the here<br />      and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon <br />  the <br />    present<br />      moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts gradually <br />    disappear.<br />      When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability to <br />    transcend<br />      time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able to <br />    traverse<br />      past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and space. <br />  We <br />    then<br />      start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>      Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We then <br />    start to<br />      understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no <br />  longer <br />    miracles<br />      but a natural flow of the universe.<br />      Master<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/search/ label/Words% <br />  20From%<br />    20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents></p>

        <p>Arun,<br />Interesting that you say that. You may have seen this before, but for <br />the benefit of all I have attached an interview with Star Wars <br />creator George Lucas (or was he the director?). </p>
<p>It is called the Theology of Star Wars. In this he says that the <br />movie actually borrowed from various religious mythologies, because <br />he believed that the themes are still very relevant. </p>

<p>Malathy,</p>
<p>I appreciated it was not your quote before sending my reply. In fact <br />I thought of addressing it as "Dear Stephen", but refrained from it!<br />By the way I liked your statement in one of your previous emails:</p>
<p>"How the bumble bee flies is a miracle. We cannot understand beyond a <br />certain point the workings of how and whether we look at it faith <br />wise or scientifically a smaller intelligence can never comprehend a <br />bigger one fully and to attempt to do so is basic human arrogance. <br />(That can be both religious or athiestic arrogance.:)"</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>"It is only by facing and asking the challenging questions we need to</p>
<blockquote><p>    ask ourselves that we learn the value and true meaning of the<br />    universal spirit, not by avoiding them."</p></blockquote>
<p>Totally agree.</p>

        <p>Dear Atpu, again the quote/question was not mine - It was the great <br />scientist Stephen Hawking :)</p>
<p>The parental model of God is similar to the white bearded punishment <br />oriented authoritatian male God of abrahamic religion who has <br />frustrated many people including scientists and thinkers. The model <br />of universal energy and oneness that our spiritual heritage has is <br />much more tolerant, experiential and accepting than that. </p>
<p>It is only by facing and asking the challenging questions we need to <br />ask ourselves that we learn the value and true meaning of the <br />universal spirit, not by avoiding them.</p>

        <p>-Ravi, I was quoting Stephen Hawking I didn't say that myself!! I was <br />only using that quote to say to bundle the world as a scientific or <br />karmic formula of any kind is difficult, we can only explain parts as <br />karma or by science, either way all those things are tools that are a <br />small part of the great unresolved universe that is a wonder.</p>
<p>To my mind as the Nammazhvar quote beautifully said God is something <br />or someone who exists for me, internally. It may not be that way to <br />someone else. In other words God is not a person or a physical entity <br />to be proven, it is more of an experience that one may seek out or <br />ignore.</p>

<p>  Well Malathi, you asked why do we need a God ( appo appo <br />Dasavatharam <br />  Govind mathiri pesaringa..lol), we dont, yet we do. A guy in remote <br />  polar circle thinks that there are no cars in the world, it is not <br />  essentially right. Does he need one - No! Do we need one - Yes! Do <br />  cars exist - Yes!</p>
<p>  I read some one's note on Chaos theory, that is actually how Karma <br />  works, you have individual Karma, collective Karma etc. Karma acts <br />on <br />  pure sequence, not just like 1.2..3...etc, rather as 1,1.1,1.11 so <br />on <br />  till 2. It is like explaining Jet dynamics to a 1st grader. </p>
<p>  Like I said earlier, i believe, we will be proven our ignorance as <br />the <br />  universe unfolds itself. All that is to be seen tomorrow, already <br />  exists. We just use the keyword science to define our new found <br />toys.<br />  Science is like a pinch of salt on a huge buffet spread standing <br />  against 1/2 foot stomach.</p>

<p>        Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we <br />can <br />      explain<br />        scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind <br />either <br />    as<br />        something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude <br />    that <br />      can not<br />        be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>        It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a <br />      miracle if it<br />        provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a <br />      catastrophe; a<br />        yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors <br />has <br />      performed a<br />        miracle.</p>
<p>        In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents <br />and <br />    our<br />        inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents <br />and <br />      what we<br />        understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort <br />    and <br />      confusion.<br />        Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' <br />is <br />      either<br />        barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>        There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet <br />      understand the<br />        laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to <br />defy<br />        'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe <br />    supports <br />      laws that<br />        go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far <br />    discovered <br />      by<br />        humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages <br />    behind <br />      many of<br />        these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding <br />and <br />      appreciating<br />        the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>        Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They <br />have <br />      discovered<br />        that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one <br />galaxy <br />      another star<br />        system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe, <br />      perhaps in<br />        another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction <br />some <br />      where in the<br />        universe.</p>
<p>        Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to <br />be<br />        proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly <br />      fluttering its<br />        wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, <br />not <br />      imagination.</p>
<p>        Matter and energy were totally different entities till <br />Einstein <br />      established<br />        their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or <br />    energy, <br />      never<br />        both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the <br />      principle of<br />        'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist <br />    simultaneously <br />      in a<br />        common time and space framework has been <br />    understood. 'Singularity' <br />      is the<br />        common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we <br />    call <br />      Brahman.</p>
<p>        Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know <br />    how. <br />      With<br />        thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to <br />flit <br />    from <br />      one zone<br />        to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to <br />ground <br />      ourselves<br />        in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future <br />and <br />      the past; a<br />        future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty <br />about. <br />      Thoughts<br />        are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts <br />we <br />      can never<br />        hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>        We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future <br />    and <br />      the past.<br />        We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, <br />in <br />      the here<br />        and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon <br />    the <br />      present<br />        moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts <br />gradually <br />      disappear.<br />        When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability <br />to <br />      transcend<br />        time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able <br />to <br />      traverse<br />        past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and <br />space. <br />    We <br />      then<br />        start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>        Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We <br />then <br />      start to<br />        understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no <br />    longer <br />      miracles<br />        but a natural flow of the universe.<br />        Master<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/search/ <br />label/Words% <br />    20From%<br />      20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents></p>

<p>Yes Sandeep, but I would put it the other way round. Fundamental lack<br />of pride in our religion is the reason for the lack of pride in our<br />history/culture/heritage etc. Anything about India roots to our great<br />religion.</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda says 'England has the strength in its political<br />power, US has its strength in its materialistic (scientific) power and<br />India has its strength in its Spiritual power. One should do what they<br />are good at and India trying to do what others do will lead to its<br />downfall'.</p>
<p>He also adds 'Some practices of Vedic dharma might seem to be<br />irrelevant, or outdated now, but whatever my ancestors created, it<br />served some good in those point of time. So let me not condemn those<br />practices and I respect those practices, even if it doesnt do any good<br />now. We have been doing good and only thing is we have to do better.'</p>
<p>what a clarity of thought! Unless we dont have this mindset, we will<br />continue to loose more of our treasures.</p>

        <p>Who is He? Is it not a She? Well if it was a She, then was it not an <br />IT ? If it was an It, was there any shape? If there was a shape is it <br />restricted ? If it is not restricted, where is It then?</p>
<p>Well Malathi, you asked why do we need a God ( appo appo Dasavatharam <br />Govind mathiri pesaringa..lol), we dont, yet we do. A guy in remote <br />polar circle thinks that there are no cars in the world, it is not <br />essentially right. Does he need one - No! Do we need one - Yes! Do <br />cars exist - Yes!</p>
<p>I read some one's note on Chaos theory, that is actually how Karma <br />works, you have individual Karma, collective Karma etc. Karma acts on <br />pure sequence, not just like 1.2..3...etc, rather as 1,1.1,1.11 so on <br />till 2. It is like explaining Jet dynamics to a 1st grader. </p>
<p>Like I said earlier, i believe, we will be proven our ignorance as the <br />universe unfolds itself. All that is to be seen tomorrow, already <br />exists. We just use the keyword science to define our new found toys.<br />Science is like a pinch of salt on a huge buffet spread standing <br />against 1/2 foot stomach.</p>

<p>      Understanding Cosmic<br />      Laws<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/2008/ 11/understanding -<br />  cosmic-<br />    laws.html </http://nithyaevents></p>
<p>      Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we can <br />    explain<br />      scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind either <br />  as<br />      something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude <br />  that <br />    can not<br />      be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>      It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a <br />    miracle if it<br />      provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a <br />    catastrophe; a<br />      yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors has <br />    performed a<br />      miracle.</p>
<p>      In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents and <br />  our<br />      inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents and <br />    what we<br />      understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort <br />  and <br />    confusion.<br />      Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' is <br />    either<br />      barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>      There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet <br />    understand the<br />      laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to defy<br />      'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe <br />  supports <br />    laws that<br />      go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far <br />  discovered <br />    by<br />      humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages <br />  behind <br />    many of<br />      these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding and <br />    appreciating<br />      the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>      Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They have <br />    discovered<br />      that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one galaxy <br />    another star<br />      system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe, <br />    perhaps in<br />      another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction some <br />    where in the<br />      universe.</p>
<p>      Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to be<br />      proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly <br />    fluttering its<br />      wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, not <br />    imagination.</p>
<p>      Matter and energy were totally different entities till Einstein <br />    established<br />      their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or <br />  energy, <br />    never<br />      both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the <br />    principle of<br />      'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist <br />  simultaneously <br />    in a<br />      common time and space framework has been <br />  understood. 'Singularity' <br />    is the<br />      common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we <br />  call <br />    Brahman.</p>
<p>      Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know <br />  how. <br />    With<br />      thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to flit <br />  from <br />    one zone<br />      to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to ground <br />    ourselves<br />      in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future and <br />    the past; a<br />      future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty about. <br />    Thoughts<br />      are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts we <br />    can never<br />      hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>      We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future <br />  and <br />    the past.<br />      We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, in <br />    the here<br />      and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon <br />  the <br />    present<br />      moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts gradually <br />    disappear.<br />      When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability to <br />    transcend<br />      time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able to <br />    traverse<br />      past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and space. <br />  We <br />    then<br />      start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>      Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We then <br />    start to<br />      understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no <br />  longer <br />    miracles<br />      but a natural flow of the universe.<br />      Master<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/search/ label/Words% <br />  20From%<br />    20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents></p>

        <p>-<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym  and Sandeep, I agree 100% of omnipresence as well as experiencing <br />oneness via meditation. Yes there has to be cause and effect but it <br />is not 100% cause and effect, in other words sometimes what <br />changes 'effect' to be something else (like people getting cured from <br />fatal cancer or waking up from coma) also constitutes the universe. <br />We do have karma as the most plausible explanation but not the only <br />one. </acronym></p>
<p>I was in an argument in the Buddhist meditation forum last week where <br />a young student called meditative oneness experience as 'chemical <br />alternation' and not anything external. In other words if you try to <br />resist thinking for a significant period of time your mind gives up <br />and generates certain chemicals that make you see th world otherwise, <br />that is all there is to it. A lot of meditators got very offended. My <br />teacher was telling her 'so what?'. It may be a chemical alteration <br />of mind still it allows you to experience something you otherwise <br />don't. All human states have some scientific explanation or the <br />other. Chemistry and attraction between a man and a woman is <br />explained very logically and dryly by several psychologists starting <br />with Freud. Does it make it any less attractive? </p>
<p>My thinking is that science and karmic theories are not formulas that <br />take away the wonder, spontaneity and many miracles of the <br />universe.They are only attempts at explaining some of it. We <br />understand and experience all of them together. AS the the great JK <br />said 'You must understand all of life, not just one little part of <br />it, that is why you must dance, cry, write poetry, experience pain. <br />For all that is life'.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Malathi</p>
<p>  Well, I think for the Universe to exist, there has to be cause and <br />effect<br />  (which is the Law of Karma).</p>
<p>  God is only a concept to make it simple. However, this origin of <br />things is<br />  the divinity or with the divinity, in what ever way we choose to <br />term it. To<br />  know this divinity, we need to have some qualification. A 1st <br />standard kid<br />  will know the same alphabets that we know but does not yet have <br />ability to<br />  conceive more than the basic. I suppose in cosmic terms most of us <br />are not<br />  even in that stage.</p>
<p>  Only an enlightened person can understand what is beyond that. That <br />is why<br />  such enlightened beings (like Nithyananda, Ramakrishna, Yogananda, <br />Gauthama<br />  Buddha for example) tell us to meditate, so that we will shed our <br />limited<br />  knowledge (to which we cling to very strongly, with so <br />called 'scientific'<br />  proof and fact) that closes the doors and urge us to increase the <br />space<br />  between thoughts to let the divine in more and more.</p>

<p>      Understanding Cosmic<br />      Laws<http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/2008/11/understanding-<br />cosmic-<br />    laws.html </http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/2008/11/understanding-<br></p>
<p>      Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we can<br />    explain<br />      scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind <br />either as<br />      something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude <br />that<br />    can not<br />      be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>      It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a<br />    miracle if it<br />      provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a<br />    catastrophe; a<br />      yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors has<br />    performed a<br />      miracle.</p>
<p>      In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents <br />and our<br />      inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents and<br />    what we<br />      understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort <br />and<br />    confusion.<br />      Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' is<br />    either<br />      barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>      There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet<br />    understand the<br />      laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to defy<br />      'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe <br />supports<br />    laws that<br />      go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far <br />discovered<br />    by<br />      humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages <br />behind<br />    many of<br />      these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding and<br />    appreciating<br />      the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>      Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They have<br />    discovered<br />      that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one galaxy<br />    another star<br />      system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe,<br />    perhaps in<br />      another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction some<br />    where in the<br />      universe.</p>
<p>      Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to be<br />      proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly<br />    fluttering its<br />      wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, not<br />    imagination.</p>
<p>      Matter and energy were totally different entities till Einstein<br />    established<br />      their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or <br />energy,<br />    never<br />      both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the<br />    principle of<br />      'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist <br />simultaneously<br />    in a<br />      common time and space framework has been <br />understood. 'Singularity'<br />    is the<br />      common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we <br />call<br />    Brahman.</p>
<p>      Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know <br />how.<br />    With<br />      thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to flit <br />from<br />    one zone<br />      to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to ground<br />    ourselves<br />      in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future and<br />    the past; a<br />      future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty about.<br />    Thoughts<br />      are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts we<br />    can never<br />      hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>      We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future <br />and<br />    the past.<br />      We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, in<br />    the here<br />      and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon <br />the<br />    present<br />      moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts gradually<br />    disappear.<br />      When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability to<br />    transcend<br />      time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able to<br />    traverse<br />      past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and <br />space. We<br />    then<br />      start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>      Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We then<br />    start to<br />      understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no <br />longer<br />    miracles<br />      but a natural flow of the universe.<br />      Master<http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/Words%<br />20From%<br />    20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/words%<br></p>

<p>    Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we can <br />  explain<br />    scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind either <br />as<br />    something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude <br />that <br />  can not<br />    be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>    It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a <br />  miracle if it<br />    provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a <br />  catastrophe; a<br />    yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors has <br />  performed a<br />    miracle.</p>
<p>    In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents and <br />our<br />    inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents and <br />  what we<br />    understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort <br />and <br />  confusion.<br />    Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' is <br />  either<br />    barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>    There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet <br />  understand the<br />    laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to defy<br />    'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe <br />supports <br />  laws that<br />    go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far <br />discovered <br />  by<br />    humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages <br />behind <br />  many of<br />    these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding and <br />  appreciating<br />    the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>    Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They have <br />  discovered<br />    that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one galaxy <br />  another star<br />    system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe, <br />  perhaps in<br />    another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction some <br />  where in the<br />    universe.</p>
<p>    Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to be<br />    proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly <br />  fluttering its<br />    wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, not <br />  imagination.</p>
<p>    Matter and energy were totally different entities till Einstein <br />  established<br />    their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or <br />energy, <br />  never<br />    both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the <br />  principle of<br />    'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist <br />simultaneously <br />  in a<br />    common time and space framework has been <br />understood. 'Singularity' <br />  is the<br />    common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we <br />call <br />  Brahman.</p>
<p>    Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know <br />how. <br />  With<br />    thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to flit <br />from <br />  one zone<br />    to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to ground <br />  ourselves<br />    in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future and <br />  the past; a<br />    future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty about. <br />  Thoughts<br />    are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts we <br />  can never<br />    hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>    We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future <br />and <br />  the past.<br />    We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, in <br />  the here<br />    and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon <br />the <br />  present<br />    moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts gradually <br />  disappear.<br />    When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability to <br />  transcend<br />    time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able to <br />  traverse<br />    past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and space. <br />We <br />  then<br />    start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>    Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We then <br />  start to<br />    understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no <br />longer <br />  miracles<br />    but a natural flow of the universe.<br />    Master<http://nithyaevents .blogspot. com/search/ label/Words% <br />20From%<br />  20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents></p>

        <p>Hi Malathi</p>
<p>Well, I think for the Universe to exist, there has to be cause and effect<br />(which is the Law of Karma).</p>
<p>God is only a concept to make it simple. However, this origin of things is<br />the divinity or with the divinity, in what ever way we choose to term it. To<br />know this divinity, we need to have some qualification. A 1st standard kid<br />will know the same alphabets that we know but does not yet have ability to<br />conceive more than the basic. I suppose in cosmic terms most of us are not<br />even in that stage.</p>
<p>Only an enlightened person can understand what is beyond that. That is why<br />such enlightened beings (like Nithyananda, Ramakrishna, Yogananda, Gauthama<br />Buddha for example) tell us to meditate, so that we will shed our limited<br />knowledge (to which we cling to very strongly, with so called 'scientific'<br />proof and fact) that closes the doors and urge us to increase the space<br />between thoughts to let the divine in more and more.</p>
<p>The below 2 videos explain this very elaborately. The 2nd one's audio and<br />video are not in sync, so you can just listen to the audio.</p>

<p>    Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we can<br />  explain<br />    scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind either as<br />    something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude that<br />  can not<br />    be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>    It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a<br />  miracle if it<br />    provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a<br />  catastrophe; a<br />    yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors has<br />  performed a<br />    miracle.</p>
<p>    In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents and our<br />    inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents and<br />  what we<br />    understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort and<br />  confusion.<br />    Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' is<br />  either<br />    barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>    There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet<br />  understand the<br />    laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to defy<br />    'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe supports<br />  laws that<br />    go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far discovered<br />  by<br />    humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages behind<br />  many of<br />    these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding and<br />  appreciating<br />    the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>    Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They have<br />  discovered<br />    that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one galaxy<br />  another star<br />    system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe,<br />  perhaps in<br />    another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction some<br />  where in the<br />    universe.</p>
<p>    Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to be<br />    proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly<br />  fluttering its<br />    wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, not<br />  imagination.</p>
<p>    Matter and energy were totally different entities till Einstein<br />  established<br />    their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or energy,<br />  never<br />    both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the<br />  principle of<br />    'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist simultaneously<br />  in a<br />    common time and space framework has been understood. 'Singularity'<br />  is the<br />    common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we call<br />  Brahman.</p>
<p>    Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know how.<br />  With<br />    thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to flit from<br />  one zone<br />    to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to ground<br />  ourselves<br />    in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future and<br />  the past; a<br />    future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty about.<br />  Thoughts<br />    are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts we<br />  can never<br />    hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>    We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future and<br />  the past.<br />    We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, in<br />  the here<br />    and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon the<br />  present<br />    moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts gradually<br />  disappear.<br />    When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability to<br />  transcend<br />    time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able to<br />  traverse<br />    past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and space. We<br />  then<br />    start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>    Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We then<br />  start to<br />    understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no longer<br />  miracles<br />    but a natural flow of the universe.<br />    Master<http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/Words%20From%<br />  20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/words%20from%<br></p>

        <p>My point is this.. (with regard to miracles).. anything that we can't<br />understand just implies that we haven't yet found the means or ways of<br />understanding it, that is the "laws" we have obtained are not perfect or<br />complete.. it just means a few years down the road there might be<br />modifications to existing laws or new ones discovered which would explain<br />the "miracle"..</p>

<p>  Arun you might want to check out this PBS documentary made by Harvard<br />  University called The Question of God. It has belivers, agnostics and<br />  non belivers in a beautifully moderated debate.</p>
<p>  I love the story of the Buddha, when asked 'What is God' replied in<br />  return 'What do you want to know?'. Our definiton or belief in God is<br />  impossible to delink from what we believe about ourselves and the<br />  world, and at some level that is something only we can understand<br />  internally.</p>
<p>  Lastly I will admit, I do have difficulties in understanding a<br />  perfectly ordered universe. I believe *parts* of the universe is<br />  ordered, and parts are not. Miracles do exist and can happen. How the<br />  bumble bee flies is a miracle. We cannot understand beyond a certain<br />  point the workings of how and whether we look at it faith wise or<br />  scientifically a smaller intelligence can never comprehend a bigger<br />  one fully and to attempt to do so is basic human arrogance. (That can<br />  be both religious or athiestic arrogance.:)</p>

<p>        Understanding Cosmic<br />        Laws<http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/2008/11/understanding-<br />  cosmic-<br />      laws.html </http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/2008/11/understanding-<br></p>
<p>        Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we can<br />      explain<br />        scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind<br />  either as<br />        something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude<br />  that<br />      can not<br />        be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>        It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a<br />      miracle if it<br />        provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a<br />      catastrophe; a<br />        yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors has<br />      performed a<br />        miracle.</p>
<p>        In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents<br />  and our<br />        inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents and<br />      what we<br />        understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort<br />  and<br />      confusion.<br />        Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' is<br />      either<br />        barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>        There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet<br />      understand the<br />        laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to defy<br />        'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe<br />  supports<br />      laws that<br />        go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far<br />  discovered<br />      by<br />        humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages<br />  behind<br />      many of<br />        these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding and<br />      appreciating<br />        the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>        Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They have<br />      discovered<br />        that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one galaxy<br />      another star<br />        system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe,<br />      perhaps in<br />        another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction some<br />      where in the<br />        universe.</p>
<p>        Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to be<br />        proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly<br />      fluttering its<br />        wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, not<br />      imagination.</p>
<p>        Matter and energy were totally different entities till Einstein<br />      established<br />        their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or<br />  energy,<br />      never<br />        both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the<br />      principle of<br />        'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist<br />  simultaneously<br />      in a<br />        common time and space framework has been<br />  understood. 'Singularity'<br />      is the<br />        common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we<br />  call<br />      Brahman.</p>
<p>        Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know<br />  how.<br />      With<br />        thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to flit<br />  from<br />      one zone<br />        to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to ground<br />      ourselves<br />        in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future and<br />      the past; a<br />        future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty about.<br />      Thoughts<br />        are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts we<br />      can never<br />        hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>        We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future<br />  and<br />      the past.<br />        We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, in<br />      the here<br />        and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon<br />  the<br />      present<br />        moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts gradually<br />      disappear.<br />        When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability to<br />      transcend<br />        time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able to<br />      traverse<br />        past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and<br />  space. We<br />      then<br />        start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>        Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We then<br />      start to<br />        understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no<br />  longer<br />      miracles<br />        but a natural flow of the universe.<br />        Master<http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/Words%<br />  20From%<br />      20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/words%<br></p>

        <p>Well,I am not given to any cynicism only what I don't understand and <br />what I understand. Never hurts to share the latter though. </p>
<p>Arun you might want to check out this PBS documentary made by Harvard <br />University called The Question of God. It has belivers, agnostics and <br />non belivers in a beautifully moderated debate. </p>
<p>I love the story of the Buddha, when asked 'What is God' replied in <br />return 'What do you want to know?'. Our definiton or belief in God is <br />impossible to delink from what we believe about ourselves and the <br />world, and at some level that is something only we can understand <br />internally. </p>
<p>Lastly I will admit, I do have difficulties in understanding a <br />perfectly ordered universe. I believe *parts* of the universe is <br />ordered, and parts are not. Miracles do exist and can happen. How the <br />bumble bee flies is a miracle. We cannot understand beyond a certain <br />point the workings of how and whether we look at it faith wise or <br />scientifically a smaller intelligence can never comprehend a bigger <br />one fully and to attempt to do so is basic human arrogance. (That can <br />be both religious or athiestic arrogance.:)</p>

<p>      Understanding Cosmic<br />      Laws<http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/2008/11/understanding-<br />cosmic-<br />    laws.html </http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/2008/11/understanding-<br></p>
<p>      Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we can<br />    explain<br />      scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind <br />either as<br />      something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude <br />that<br />    can not<br />      be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>      It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a<br />    miracle if it<br />      provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a<br />    catastrophe; a<br />      yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors has<br />    performed a<br />      miracle.</p>
<p>      In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents <br />and our<br />      inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents and<br />    what we<br />      understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort <br />and<br />    confusion.<br />      Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' is<br />    either<br />      barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>      There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet<br />    understand the<br />      laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to defy<br />      'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe <br />supports<br />    laws that<br />      go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far <br />discovered<br />    by<br />      humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages <br />behind<br />    many of<br />      these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding and<br />    appreciating<br />      the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>      Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They have<br />    discovered<br />      that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one galaxy<br />    another star<br />      system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe,<br />    perhaps in<br />      another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction some<br />    where in the<br />      universe.</p>
<p>      Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to be<br />      proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly<br />    fluttering its<br />      wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, not<br />    imagination.</p>
<p>      Matter and energy were totally different entities till Einstein<br />    established<br />      their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or <br />energy,<br />    never<br />      both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the<br />    principle of<br />      'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist <br />simultaneously<br />    in a<br />      common time and space framework has been <br />understood. 'Singularity'<br />    is the<br />      common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we <br />call<br />    Brahman.</p>
<p>      Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know <br />how.<br />    With<br />      thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to flit <br />from<br />    one zone<br />      to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to ground<br />    ourselves<br />      in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future and<br />    the past; a<br />      future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty about.<br />    Thoughts<br />      are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts we<br />    can never<br />      hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>      We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future <br />and<br />    the past.<br />      We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, in<br />    the here<br />      and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon <br />the<br />    present<br />      moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts gradually<br />    disappear.<br />      When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability to<br />    transcend<br />      time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able to<br />    traverse<br />      past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and <br />space. We<br />    then<br />      start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>      Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We then<br />    start to<br />      understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no <br />longer<br />    miracles<br />      but a natural flow of the universe.<br />      Master<http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/Words%<br />20From%<br />    20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/words%<br></p>

        <p>Sandeep, very thought provoking and thank you. I do not in any way <br />mean to challenge words of a great/learned person, but am tempted to <br />quote Stephen Hawking when he said why does a well organised universe <br />need a God?</p>
<p>Does anyone have any thoughts,</p>

<p>  Any event that we do not fully comprehend, any thing that we can <br />explain<br />  scientifically and rationally gets filed away in our mind either as<br />  something totally inconsequential, or if it is of a magnitude that <br />can not<br />  be ignored gets classified under catastrophes or miracles.</p>
<p>  It is a catastrophe if it involves material loss to us and a <br />miracle if it<br />  provides us material gain. It's that simple. A tsunami is a <br />catastrophe; a<br />  yogi who heals a person given up as a lost case by doctors has <br />performed a<br />  miracle.</p>
<p>  In both cases, the degree of unexpectedness of the incidents and our<br />  inability to see any causal linkage between these incidents and <br />what we<br />  understand to be scientific laws causes us unease, discomfort and <br />confusion.<br />  Anything that is not supported by what we term as 'science' is <br />either<br />  barbaric or a miracle.</p>
<p>  There are no miracles in life. It is just that we do not yet <br />understand the<br />  laws that govern occurrence of such incidents which seem to defy<br />  'scientific' laws. Once we understand that this universe supports <br />laws that<br />  go beyond these 'scientific' laws that have been so far discovered <br />by<br />  humans, we start understanding the cause and effect linkages behind <br />many of<br />  these inexplicable happenings. We then start understanding and <br />appreciating<br />  the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
<p>  Astrophysicists talk now about the parallel universe. They have <br />discovered<br />  that each time a star system dies as a black hole in one galaxy <br />another star<br />  system is born in a big bang somewhere else in the universe, <br />perhaps in<br />  another galaxy. Every action any where produces a reaction some <br />where in the<br />  universe.</p>
<p>  Chaos Theory now says that action and reaction do not need to be<br />  proportionate. There is no linearity in nature. A butterfly <br />fluttering its<br />  wings in China causes a tornado in Mexico! This is science, not <br />imagination.</p>
<p>  Matter and energy were totally different entities till Einstein <br />established<br />  their linkage. Even after Einstein, it was either matter or energy, <br />never<br />  both in the same time and space. It is only recently that the <br />principle of<br />  'singularity' that allows matter and energy to exist simultaneously <br />in a<br />  common time and space framework has been understood. 'Singularity' <br />is the<br />  common universal platform the Universal Consciousness that we call <br />Brahman.</p>
<p>  Making contact with Brahman is not impossible, once you know how. <br />With<br />  thoughts crowding our mind, all that we normally do is to flit from <br />one zone<br />  to another, from regrets to speculations, with no time to ground <br />ourselves<br />  in the present. Thoughts are the linkages between the future and <br />the past; a<br />  future that is speculative and a past that we feel guilty about. <br />Thoughts<br />  are always unsettling; they cause suffering. Through thoughts we <br />can never<br />  hope to understand how nature, how the universe functions.</p>
<p>  We need to go beyond thought; we need to transcend the future and <br />the past.<br />  We can do that by letting ourselves to settle in the present, in <br />the here<br />  and now. When we stay in the present moment, fully focus upon the <br />present<br />  moment, we are in meditation. In meditation thoughts gradually <br />disappear.<br />  When thoughts disappear there is an expansion of our ability to <br />transcend<br />  time and space. When we transcend time and space, we are able to <br />traverse<br />  past, present and future simultaneously, both in time and space. We <br />then<br />  start to understand the cosmic law.</p>
<p>  Once we are in the present miracles become common place. We then <br />start to<br />  understand that whatever science is unable to explain are no longer <br />miracles<br />  but a natural flow of the universe.<br />  Master<http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/Words%20From%<br />20The%20Master </http://nithyaevents.blogspot.com/search/label/words%20from%<br></p>

        <p>Dear SPS Aiyya,<br />I have a couple of books which I really like: A History of Mathematics and a<br />History of Science ("western science")..<br />Both are very elevating to see how scientific discoveries have been built on<br />previous contributions.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>    A sentiment expressed by the author is that science should be<br />  communicated<br />    to students and ordinary people, independent of the technical<br />  details.<br />    There are several popular science books available, but I<br />  thoroughly enjoyed<br />    reading Bill Bryson's "A Short History of Nearly Everything".

<p>  I would strongly recommend this book if you are interested in<br />  science and history behind various discoveries.</p>

<p>  Dear Atpu,</p>
<p>  that is very good reference.. And I fully concur on Science works<br />  made simplified for more persons to follow ..</p>
<p>  During School days, mathematics was a big challenge..</p>
<p>  I read some book on Maths .. and interesting puzzle.. or similar<br />  one..</p>
<p>  I remember the simplest one even now :</p>
<p>  12345679 x 8 = 9876542 !</p>
<p>  This is also used for checking the calculator since all the numerals<br />  (except 0 ) are used !</p>
<p>  I took interest in Maths ... which paved way for further higher<br />  studeis...</p>
<p>  May be I have not touched such book on Science .. !</p>

        <p>Thanks for the article, Arun.</p>
<p>Malathi, the article appeared in the New York Times, written by :<br />"Brian Greene, a professor of physics at Columbia, is the author of 'The <br />Elegant Universe' and 'The Fabric of the Cosmos'"</p>
<p>The link attached:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/opinion/01greene.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/opinion/01greene.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/opinion/01greene.html</a></p>
<p>A sentiment expressed by the author is that science should be communicated <br />to students and ordinary people, independent of the technical details. <br />There are several popular science books available, but I thoroughly enjoyed <br />reading Bill Bryson's "A Short History of Nearly Everything". He explains <br />in simple and witty english, everything from particle physics and <br />paleontology to evolution and astronomy.<br />I would strongly recommend this book if you are interested in science and <br />history behind various discoveries.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Atpu. </p>

<p>      A very nice article which I hope resonates with people here.</p>
<p>      Regards,</p>
<p>      Arun</p>
<p>      A couple of years ago I received a letter from an American <br />    soldier in<br />      Iraq. The letter began by saying that, as we've all become <br />    painfully aware,<br />      serving on the front lines is physically exhausting and <br />  emotionally<br />      debilitating. But the reason for his writing was to tell me <br />that <br />  in <br />    that<br />      hostile and lonely environment, a book I'd written had become a <br />    kind of<br />      lifeline. As the book is about science ??" one that traces <br />    physicists' search<br />      for nature's deepest laws ??" the soldiers' letter might strike <br />  you <br />    as, well,<br />      odd.</p>
<p>      But it's not. Rather it speaks to the powerful role science <br />can <br />    play in<br />      giving life context and meaning. At the same time, the <br />soldier's <br />    letter<br />      emphasized something I've increasingly come to believe: <br />America's<br />      educational system fails to teach science in a way that allows <br />    students to<br />      integrate it into their lives. When we consider the ubiquity of <br />    cell phones,<br />      iPods, personal computers on the Internet, it's easy to see how <br />    science is<br />      woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we <br />  benefit <br />    from MRI<br />      devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately <br />    appreciate how<br />      science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the <br />  state <br />    of the<br />      world and identify looming challenges like climate change, <br />global <br />    pandemics,<br />      security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate <br />in <br />    turning to<br />      science to gauge the problems and find solutions.</p>
<p>      And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hoverig on <br />the <br />    horizon ??"<br />      stem cells, genomic sequencing, longevity research, <br />nanoscience, <br />    quantum<br />      computers, space technology ??" we realize how crucial it is to <br />    cultivate a<br />      general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's <br />    simply no<br />      other way that as a society we will be prepared to make <br />informed <br />    decisions<br />      on a range of issues that will shape the future.</p>
<p>      These are the standard reasons many would give in explaining <br />  why <br />    science<br />      matters.<br />      But the reason science can really matters runs deeper still. <br />    Science is a<br />      way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process <br />  that <br />    takes us<br />      from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, <br />    predictive and<br />      reliable ??" a transformation, for those lucky enough to <br />  experience <br />    it, that<br />      is empowering and emotional. To be able to think through and <br />grasp<br />      explanations ??" for everything from why the sky is blue to how <br />    life formed on<br />      earth ??" not because they are declared dogma but rather <br />because <br />    they reveal<br />      patterns confirmed by experiment and observation, is one of the <br />  most<br />      precious of human experiences. As a practicing scientist, I <br />know <br />    this from<br />      my own work and study.</p>
<p>      But I also know that you don't have to be a scientist for <br />  science <br />    to be<br />      transformative. I've seen children's eyes light up as I've told <br />    them about<br />      black holes and the big bang. I've spoken with high school <br />  dropouts <br />    who've<br />      stumbled on popular science books about the human genome <br />project, <br />    and then<br />      returned to school with new-found purpose.</p>
<p>      And in that letter from Iraq, the soldier told me how <br />learning <br />    about<br />      relativity and quantum physics in the dusty and dangerous <br />  environs <br />    of<br />      greater Baghdad kept him going because it revealed a deeper <br />  reality <br />    of which<br />      we're all a part.</p>
<p>      It's striking that science is still widely viewed as an <br />  isolated <br />    body of<br />      largely esoteric knowledge that sometimes shows up in <br />the "real" <br />    world in<br />      the form of technological or medical advances. In reality, <br />  science <br />    is a<br />      language of hope and inspiration, providing discoveries that <br />    instill a sense<br />      of connection to our lives and our world.</p>
<p>      I've spoken with so many people over the years whose <br />encounters <br />    with<br />      science in school left them thinking of it as cold, distant and<br />      intimidating. What a shame. Like a life without music, art or <br />    literature, a<br />      life without science is bereft of something that gives <br />experience <br />  a <br />    rich and<br />      otherwise inaccessible dimension.</p>
<p>      It's one thing to go outside on a crisp, clear night and <br />marvel <br />    at a sky<br />      full of stars. It's another to marvel not only at the spectacle <br />  but <br />    to<br />      recognize that those stars are the results of exceedingly <br />ordered <br />    conditions<br />      13.7 billion years ago at the moment of the big bang. It's <br />  another <br />    still to<br />      understand how those stars act as nuclear furnaces that supply <br />  the <br />    universe<br />      with carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, the raw material of life as <br />we <br />    know it.</p>
<p>      And it's yet another level of experience to realize that <br />those <br />    stars<br />      account for less than 4 percent of what's out there ??" the <br />rest <br />    being of an<br />      unknown composition, so-called dark matter and energy, which <br />    researchers are<br />      now trying to divine.</p>
<p>      As every parent knows, children begin life as uninhibited, <br />    unabashed<br />we <br />    want to<br />      know what things are and how they work ??" we begin life as <br />  little <br />    scientists.<br />      But most of us quickly lose our intrinsic scientific passion. <br />And <br />    it's a<br />      profound loss. A great many studies have focused on this <br />problem,<br />      identifying important opportunities for improving science <br />  education.<br />      Recommendations have ranged from increasing the level of <br />training <br />    for<br />      science teachers to curriculum reforms.</p>
<p>      But most of these studies avoid an overarching systemic <br />issue: <br />  In <br />    teaching<br />      students, we continually fail to activate rich opportunities <br />for <br />    revealing<br />      the breathtaking vistas opened up by science, and instead focus <br />  on <br />    the need<br />      to gain competency with science's underlying technical details.</p>
<p>      In fact, many students I've spoken to have little sense of <br />the <br />  big<br />      questions those technical details collectively try to answer: <br />  Where <br />    did the<br />      universe come from? How did life originate? How does the brain <br />  give <br />    rise to<br />      consciousness? Like a music curriculum that requires its <br />students <br />  to<br />      practice scales while rarely if ever inspiring them by playing <br />  the <br />    great<br />      masterpieces, this way of teaching science squanders the chance <br />  to <br />    make<br />      students sit up in their chairs and say, "Wow, that's science?".</p>
<p>      In physics, just to give a sense of the raw material that's <br />    available to<br />      be leveraged, the most revolutionary of advances have happened <br />in <br />    the last<br />      100 years ??" special relativity, general relativity, quantum <br />    mechanics ??" a<br />      symphony of discoveries that changed our conception of reality. <br />  More<br />      recently, the last 10 years have witnessed an upheaval in our <br />    understanding<br />      of the universe's composition, yielding a wholly new prediction <br />  for <br />    what the<br />      cosmos will be like in the far future These are paradigm-shaking<br />      developments. But rare is the high school class in which these <br />    breakthroughs<br />      are introduced. It's much the same story in classes for <br />biology, <br />    chemistry<br />      and mathematics.</p>
<p>      At the root of this pedagogical approach is a firm belief in <br />  the <br />    vertical<br />      nature of science: You must master A before moving on to B. <br />    Certainly, when<br />      it comes to teaching the technicalities ??" solving this <br />  equation, <br />    balancing<br />      the reaction, grasping the discrete parts of the cell ??" the <br />    verticality of<br />      science is unassailable. But science is so much more than its <br />    technical<br />      details. And with careful attention to presentation, cutting-<br />edge <br />    insights<br />      and discoveries can be clearly and faithfully communicated to <br />    students<br />      independent of those details; in fact, those insights and <br />    discoveries are<br />      precisely the ones that can drive a young student to want to <br />  learn <br />    the<br />      details. We rob science education of life when we focus solely <br />on <br />    results<br />      and seek to train students to solve problems and recite facts <br />    without a<br />      commensurate emphasis on transporting them out beyond the stars.</p>
<p>      Science is the greatest of all adventure stories, one that's <br />  been<br />      unfolding for thousand of years. Science needs to be taught to <br />  the <br />    young and<br />      communicated to the mature in a manner that captures this <br />drama. <br />  We <br />    must<br />      embark on a cultural shift that places science in its rightful <br />  place<br />      alongside music, art and literature as an indispensable part of <br />    what makes<br />      life worth living.</p>
<p>      It's the birthright of every child, it's a necessity for <br />every <br />    adult, to<br />      look out on the world, as the soldier in Iraq did, and see that <br />  the <br />    wonder<br />      of the cosmos transcends everything that divides us.</p>

        <p>Malathy<br />Very nice poem from a great writer/thinker. But very much a <br />adaptation from the Rig Veda.. </p>
<p>Check out this passage</p>
<p>"Who knows, and shall declare when and why <br />This creation (ever) took place ? <br />The gods are subsequent to the production of the world, <br />Who, then, can know from whence <br />This varied world comes ? <br />He, who in highest heaven is Ruler does know : <br />But not another can possess that knowledge</p>

<p>    A very nice article which I hope resonates with people here.</p>
<p>    Regards,</p>
<p>    Arun</p>
<p>    A couple of years ago I received a letter from an American <br />  soldier in<br />    Iraq. The letter began by saying that, as we've all become <br />  painfully aware,<br />    serving on the front lines is physically exhausting and <br />emotionally<br />    debilitating. But the reason for his writing was to tell me that <br />in <br />  that<br />    hostile and lonely environment, a book I'd written had become a <br />  kind of<br />    lifeline. As the book is about science ??" one that traces <br />  physicists' search<br />    for nature's deepest laws ??" the soldiers' letter might strike <br />you <br />  as, well,<br />    odd.</p>
<p>    But it's not. Rather it speaks to the powerful role science can <br />  play in<br />    giving life context and meaning. At the same time, the soldier's <br />  letter<br />    emphasized something I've increasingly come to believe: America's<br />    educational system fails to teach science in a way that allows <br />  students to<br />    integrate it into their lives. When we consider the ubiquity of <br />  cell phones,<br />    iPods, personal computers on the Internet, it's easy to see how <br />  science is<br />    woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we <br />benefit <br />  from MRI<br />    devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately <br />  appreciate how<br />    science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the <br />state <br />  of the<br />    world and identify looming challenges like climate change, global <br />  pandemics,<br />    security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in <br />  turning to<br />    science to gauge the problems and find solutions.</p>
<p>    And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hoverig on the <br />  horizon ??"<br />    stem cells, genomic sequencing, longevity research, nanoscience, <br />  quantum<br />    computers, space technology ??" we realize how crucial it is to <br />  cultivate a<br />    general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's <br />  simply no<br />    other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed <br />  decisions<br />    on a range of issues that will shape the future.</p>
<p>    These are the standard reasons many would give in explaining <br />why <br />  science<br />    matters.<br />    But the reason science can really matters runs deeper still. <br />  Science is a<br />    way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process <br />that <br />  takes us<br />    from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, <br />  predictive and<br />    reliable ??" a transformation, for those lucky enough to <br />experience <br />  it, that<br />    is empowering and emotional. To be able to think through and grasp<br />    explanations ??" for everything from why the sky is blue to how <br />  life formed on<br />    earth ??" not because they are declared dogma but rather because <br />  they reveal<br />    patterns confirmed by experiment and observation, is one of the <br />most<br />    precious of human experiences. As a practicing scientist, I know <br />  this from<br />    my own work and study.</p>
<p>    But I also know that you don't have to be a scientist for <br />science <br />  to be<br />    transformative. I've seen children's eyes light up as I've told <br />  them about<br />    black holes and the big bang. I've spoken with high school <br />dropouts <br />  who've<br />    stumbled on popular science books about the human genome project, <br />  and then<br />    returned to school with new-found purpose.</p>
<p>    And in that letter from Iraq, the soldier told me how learning <br />  about<br />    relativity and quantum physics in the dusty and dangerous <br />environs <br />  of<br />    greater Baghdad kept him going because it revealed a deeper <br />reality <br />  of which<br />    we're all a part.</p>
<p>    It's striking that science is still widely viewed as an <br />isolated <br />  body of<br />    largely esoteric knowledge that sometimes shows up in the "real" <br />  world in<br />    the form of technological or medical advances. In reality, <br />science <br />  is a<br />    language of hope and inspiration, providing discoveries that <br />  instill a sense<br />    of connection to our lives and our world.</p>
<p>    I've spoken with so many people over the years whose encounters <br />  with<br />    science in school left them thinking of it as cold, distant and<br />    intimidating. What a shame. Like a life without music, art or <br />  literature, a<br />    life without science is bereft of something that gives experience <br />a <br />  rich and<br />    otherwise inaccessible dimension.</p>
<p>    It's one thing to go outside on a crisp, clear night and marvel <br />  at a sky<br />    full of stars. It's another to marvel not only at the spectacle <br />but <br />  to<br />    recognize that those stars are the results of exceedingly ordered <br />  conditions<br />    13.7 billion years ago at the moment of the big bang. It's <br />another <br />  still to<br />    understand how those stars act as nuclear furnaces that supply <br />the <br />  universe<br />    with carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, the raw material of life as we <br />  know it.</p>
<p>    And it's yet another level of experience to realize that those <br />  stars<br />    account for less than 4 percent of what's out there ??" the rest <br />  being of an<br />    unknown composition, so-called dark matter and energy, which <br />  researchers are<br />    now trying to divine.</p>
<p>    As every parent knows, children begin life as uninhibited, <br />  unabashed<br />  want to<br />    know what things are and how they work ??" we begin life as <br />little <br />  scientists.<br />    But most of us quickly lose our intrinsic scientific passion. And <br />  it's a<br />    profound loss. A great many studies have focused on this problem,<br />    identifying important opportunities for improving science <br />education.<br />    Recommendations have ranged from increasing the level of training <br />  for<br />    science teachers to curriculum reforms.</p>

<p>Malathi</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Arun Krishnan" <br /><drarunkrishnan@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  A very nice article which I hope resonates with people here.</p>
<p>  Regards,</p>
<p>  Arun</p>
<p>  A couple of years ago I received a letter from an American <br />soldier in<br />  Iraq. The letter began by saying that, as we've all become <br />painfully aware,<br />  serving on the front lines is physically exhausting and emotionally<br />  debilitating. But the reason for his writing was to tell me that in <br />that<br />  hostile and lonely environment, a book I'd written had become a <br />kind of<br />  lifeline. As the book is about science ??" one that traces <br />physicists' search<br />  for nature's deepest laws ??" the soldiers' letter might strike you <br />as, well,<br />  odd.</p>
<p>  But it's not. Rather it speaks to the powerful role science can <br />play in<br />  giving life context and meaning. At the same time, the soldier's <br />letter<br />  emphasized something I've increasingly come to believe: America's<br />  educational system fails to teach science in a way that allows <br />students to<br />  integrate it into their lives. When we consider the ubiquity of <br />cell phones,<br />  iPods, personal computers on the Internet, it's easy to see how <br />science is<br />  woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit <br />from MRI<br />  devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately <br />appreciate how<br />  science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state <br />of the<br />  world and identify looming challenges like climate change, global <br />pandemics,<br />  security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in <br />turning to<br />  science to gauge the problems and find solutions.</p>
<p>  And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hoverig on the <br />horizon ??"<br />  stem cells, genomic sequencing, longevity research, nanoscience, <br />quantum<br />  computers, space technology ??" we realize how crucial it is to <br />cultivate a<br />  general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's <br />simply no<br />  other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed <br />decisions<br />  on a range of issues that will shape the future.</p>
<p>  These are the standard reasons many would give in explaining why <br />science<br />  matters.<br />  But the reason science can really matters runs deeper still. <br />Science is a<br />  way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process that <br />takes us<br />  from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, <br />predictive and<br />  reliable ??" a transformation, for those lucky enough to experience <br />it, that<br />  is empowering and emotional. To be able to think through and grasp<br />  explanations ??" for everything from why the sky is blue to how <br />life formed on<br />  earth ??" not because they are declared dogma but rather because <br />they reveal<br />  patterns confirmed by experiment and observation, is one of the most<br />  precious of human experiences. As a practicing scientist, I know <br />this from<br />  my own work and study.</p>
<p>  But I also know that you don't have to be a scientist for science <br />to be<br />  transformative. I've seen children's eyes light up as I've told <br />them about<br />  black holes and the big bang. I've spoken with high school dropouts <br />who've<br />  stumbled on popular science books about the human genome project, <br />and then<br />  returned to school with new-found purpose.</p>
<p>  And in that letter from Iraq, the soldier told me how learning <br />about<br />  relativity and quantum physics in the dusty and dangerous environs <br />of<br />  greater Baghdad kept him going because it revealed a deeper reality <br />of which<br />  we're all a part.</p>
<p>  It's striking that science is still widely viewed as an isolated <br />body of<br />  largely esoteric knowledge that sometimes shows up in the "real" <br />world in<br />  the form of technological or medical advances. In reality, science <br />is a<br />  language of hope and inspiration, providing discoveries that <br />instill a sense<br />  of connection to our lives and our world.</p>
<p>  I've spoken with so many people over the years whose encounters <br />with<br />  science in school left them thinking of it as cold, distant and<br />  intimidating. What a shame. Like a life without music, art or <br />literature, a<br />  life without science is bereft of something that gives experience a <br />rich and<br />  otherwise inaccessible dimension.</p>
<p>  It's one thing to go outside on a crisp, clear night and marvel <br />at a sky<br />  full of stars. It's another to marvel not only at the spectacle but <br />to<br />  recognize that those stars are the results of exceedingly ordered <br />conditions<br />  13.7 billion years ago at the moment of the big bang. It's another <br />still to<br />  understand how those stars act as nuclear furnaces that supply the <br />universe<br />  with carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, the raw material of life as we <br />know it.</p>
<p>  And it's yet another level of experience to realize that those <br />stars<br />  account for less than 4 percent of what's out there ??" the rest <br />being of an<br />  unknown composition, so-called dark matter and energy, which <br />researchers are<br />  now trying to divine.</p>
<p>  As every parent knows, children begin life as uninhibited, <br />unabashed</p></blockquote>
<p>want to</p>
<blockquote><p>  know what things are and how they work ??" we begin life as little <br />scientists.<br />  But most of us quickly lose our intrinsic scientific passion. And <br />it's a<br />  profound loss. A great many studies have focused on this problem,<br />  identifying important opportunities for improving science education.<br />  Recommendations have ranged from increasing the level of training <br />for<br />  science teachers to curriculum reforms.</p>
<p>  But most of these studies avoid an overarching systemic issue: In <br />teaching<br />  students, we continually fail to activate rich opportunities for <br />revealing<br />  the breathtaking vistas opened up by science, and instead focus on <br />the need<br />  to gain competency with science's underlying technical details.</p>
<p>  In fact, many students I've spoken to have little sense of the big<br />  questions those technical details collectively try to answer: Where <br />did the<br />  universe come from? How did life originate? How does the brain give <br />rise to<br />  consciousness? Like a music curriculum that requires its students to<br />  practice scales while rarely if ever inspiring them by playing the <br />great<br />  masterpieces, this way of teaching science squanders the chance to <br />make<br />  students sit up in their chairs and say, "Wow, that's science?".</p>
<p>  In physics, just to give a sense of the raw material that's <br />available to<br />  be leveraged, the most revolutionary of advances have happened in <br />the last<br />  100 years ??" special relativity, general relativity, quantum <br />mechanics ??" a<br />  symphony of discoveries that changed our conception of reality. More<br />  recently, the last 10 years have witnessed an upheaval in our <br />understanding<br />  of the universe's composition, yielding a wholly new prediction for <br />what the<br />  cosmos will be like in the far future These are paradigm-shaking<br />  developments. But rare is the high school class in which these <br />breakthroughs<br />  are introduced. It's much the same story in classes for biology, <br />chemistry<br />  and mathematics.</p>
<p>  At the root of this pedagogical approach is a firm belief in the <br />vertical<br />  nature of science: You must master A before moving on to B. <br />Certainly, when<br />  it comes to teaching the technicalities ??" solving this equation, <br />balancing<br />  the reaction, grasping the discrete parts of the cell ??" the <br />verticality of<br />  science is unassailable. But science is so much more than its <br />technical<br />  details. And with careful attention to presentation, cutting-edge <br />insights<br />  and discoveries can be clearly and faithfully communicated to <br />students<br />  independent of those details; in fact, those insights and <br />discoveries are<br />  precisely the ones that can drive a young student to want to learn <br />the<br />  details. We rob science education of life when we focus solely on <br />results<br />  and seek to train students to solve problems and recite facts <br />without a<br />  commensurate emphasis on transporting them out beyond the stars.</p>
<p>  Science is the greatest of all adventure stories, one that's been<br />  unfolding for thousand of years. Science needs to be taught to the <br />young and<br />  communicated to the mature in a manner that captures this drama. We <br />must<br />  embark on a cultural shift that places science in its rightful place<br />  alongside music, art and literature as an indispensable part of <br />what makes<br />  life worth living.</p>
<p>  It's the birthright of every child, it's a necessity for every <br />adult, to<br />  look out on the world, as the soldier in Iraq did, and see that the <br />wonder<br />  of the cosmos transcends everything that divides us.</p>
