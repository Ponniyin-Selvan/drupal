</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Sumeetha...</p>
<p>Well done. The case was well-thought out and well presented.:-) (I've <br />got a doubt though- I was of the impression that the Veerapandian who had an <br />affaire with Mandakini -I'm pretty sure that Nandini was Veerapandian's <br />daughter- and the Veerapandian who died at the hands of Aditha Karikalan <br />were one and the same...this is the first I've ever heard about the <br />'brother' theory.)</p>
<p>I had a discussion on the same subject about a year ago with another <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  <br />fanatic. To my question about Nandini's origins, I got the reply that she <br />was undoubtedly Vaarapandian's daughter. The reasoning went like this...</acronym></p>
<p>1) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would never fall in <br />love with any one in a space of few days (like a wounded Veerapandian after <br />math of the Madurai por). Assuming that she knew something of her parentage <br />by then, this would amount to a classical "Electra complex" case study.</p>
<p>2) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would go to any length - <br />even to calling her father her lover - for attaining what she wants.</p>
<p>3) The chronology. Even though Kalki muddles up in the chronology, there is <br />clearly a gap of two years between, the parting of Sundara Cholar- Mandagini <br />and the birth of the twins in Pazhayarai. And these two years are filled up <br />with the Payithiyakaran a.k.a Karuthiruman account.</p>
<p>4) The Karuthiruman story - Here he clearly states that he picked up both <br />Mandagini and Veerapandian in his "odam" and left them together in northern <br />Lanka when he went to Rohanam with Veera Pandiyan's message to Mahindan. And <br />when he returned he found Mandagini pregnant. This not-so-subtle information <br />confirms, Veerapandian as the father of mandagini&#146;s twins.</p>
<p>5) The nature of the novel. Even though p.s is a magnum opus, it suffers <br />from a serious flaw - it was serialized and it is handicapped with all the <br />trappings of a Thodarkadhai. So when in the first pagam, in "Nandiniyin <br />kadhalan", Kalki reveals a sensational item that of Nandini being Veera <br />Pandiyan&#146;s lover. In my opinion this is a standard trick of thodar kadhai <br />genre to sustain reader interest - Kalki would have got no inclination about <br />how big or how long the novel was going to be at that time. Later some two <br />years later, he could have decided to make Nandini the daughter and not the <br />lover of Veerapandian as he originally intended.</p>
<p>6) There is one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian was her <br />father,when he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back at him for <br />abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, she does <br />what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else her lover, <br />so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri at that person - in this case <br />VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took revenge on her father for leaving <br />her mother destitute. Later when she grieves for her father, she <br />conveniently forgets that she is the primary reason for his death and swears <br />vengeance on the cholas. This school of thought is advocated by the section <br />that view Nandini as an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi <br />character who just wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her.</p>
<p>7) The case for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan&#146;s lover is weak. Abathudavi's <br />claim that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi before he died. This <br />could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing here as his progeny (the <br />Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have told him). Thinking of a way to <br />include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her as the <br />patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the continuing <br />confrontation against the cholas after his time. He doesn&#146;t know whether his <br />official heirs have survived (like the kuzhandai vandiyathevan meets). So he <br />makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to the Pandiyan cause.</p>
<p>Well, what does everybody think?</p>
<p>I also thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or is she <br />merely a victim of circumstance??? I've certain arguments there too...what <br />do you think, Sumi?</p>
<p>Ciaow...<br />Pavithra.</p>

          The Nandini Conundrum...        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>In my view, I think at that point Nandhini would not have known that she was<br />veerapandiyan's daughter and the injured person in her house is actually her<br />brother. So it might be possible that she really was in love with him<br />or just told that to Aditha just to infuriate him as she was angry with him.<br />May be she just did not care abt the outcome of her action. May be at a<br />later point of time she might have learnt the truth and wanted to avenge the<br />death of Veerapandiyan. More than the death of Veerapandiyan, i guess it<br />might be all the insults and yematram that she faced in and by the Chola<br />royalty that would have made her resolve to avenge them.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi sps sir</p>
<p>  Thanks for bringing this up - would Nandhini have been so calculative<br />  - that she knew one way or other Veerapandian's time was up - Aditya<br />  would capture him and that would already weaken the pandya forces. She<br />  was well aware of aditya's love for her ( and from the aditya<br />  assasination chapter and their conv during the fateful night - we see<br />  that she too loved him dearly) - did she use it to twist him to kill<br />  an unarmed injured veerapandian. That would explain why she called him<br />  her lover.</p>
<p>  on second thought, maybe shee watched a few Murali or early vijay<br />  movies - where the hero would sacrifice his love for his lover's lover !!!</p>
<p>  Aditya was a lion and he acted like a true lion.</p>

        <p>Hi sps sir</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this up - would Nandhini have been so calculative<br />- that she knew one way or other Veerapandian's time was up - Aditya<br />would capture him and that would already weaken the pandya forces. She<br />was well aware of aditya's love for her ( and from the aditya<br />assasination chapter and their conv during the fateful night - we see<br />that she too loved him dearly) - did she use it to twist him to kill<br />an unarmed injured veerapandian. That would explain why she called him<br />her lover. </p>
<p>on second thought, maybe shee watched a few Murali or early vijay<br />movies - where the hero would sacrifice his love for his lover's lover !!!</p>
<p>Aditya was a lion and he acted like a true lion. </p>

<p>  --------------------<br />  Reposting Message 148 / 8.7.2002 by Sumeetha Vijayaraghavan :</p>
<p>  Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>  When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based on<br />  the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how to<br />  start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to begin<br />  this series with a question which pops in all our minds while we read<br />  this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by any<br />  author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the entire<br />  novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we get to know<br />  a new facet about her character and equally a new secret about her<br />  life.</p>
<p>  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images that<br />  this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery woman in<br />  a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. When<br />  Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she<br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After listening<br />  to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a helpless girl who<br />  was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but when Vandiya Devan<br />  meets her for the first time she appears to be powerful woman with a<br />  fleet of servants to do her bidding and she also wields enough power<br />  to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally<br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her<br />  beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is<br />  certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the<br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her<br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick<br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava<br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is<br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful.<br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan<br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the<br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the<br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies<br />  who want avenge their king's death.</p>
<p>  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic images<br />  of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an unfortunate<br />  woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure<br />  that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it<br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion<br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after<br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>  The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman<br />  saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her memory<br />  and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues<br />  Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>  Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the<br />  Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall<br />  in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him?</p>
<p>  Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan.<br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani,<br />  Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of<br />  Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not recognize<br />  him?</p>
<p>  The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two individuals<br />  after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends Karuthiruman as a<br />  messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi Karai by her<br />  father. But when he arrives there he finds that Mandakini has had<br />  another accident with result her memory is back. Now she does not<br />  recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not know what happened<br />  to her from the time she fell from the lighthouse and her last<br />  accident.</p>
<p>  Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? Was<br />  he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles<br />  Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally<br />  beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we<br />  assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly because<br />  I cannot imagine what other business a king like Veerapandiyan would<br />  have with her. And that too, a king who has been ousted from his<br />  kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to rally support. One would<br />  think that he has lots of things in mind other than to wonder about<br />  an unfortunate woman with whom he had traveled for a short while<br />  unless he had developed a special love or affection for her. Only<br />  that could have prompted him find out what happened to her.</p>
<p>  Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to<br />  her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman<br />  finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in Chola<br />  household but before he could get this information to the king he is<br />  captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that she was<br />  pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to their<br />  mother.</p>
<p>  Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that<br />  Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the<br />  Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref:<br />  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is also<br />  possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22 years<br />  before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. Either way<br />  we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's daughter.</p>
<p>  The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of<br />  Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to<br />  suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the<br />  Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must note.<br />  When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he starts with<br />  a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some imagination as well<br />  along with the story?" Now which part of it is imagination is<br />  difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>  After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to<br />  Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of Nandini's<br />  friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to Pandya<br />  Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and<br />  Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody to<br />  wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>  When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes place<br />  the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's house. And<br />  Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the Chola<br />  soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at the<br />  Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by Kundavai? Or<br />  was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was her father?<br />  What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? I<br />  am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that<br />  Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have<br />  told her so as well.</p>
<p>  But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that<br />  Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the<br />  presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she<br />  have declared that if she had known that he is her father?<br />  Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had<br />  realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her<br />  brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any<br />  logic!</p>
<p>  Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him if<br />  he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she needn't<br />  have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had plainly put<br />  across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and that might have<br />  done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a mad rage.<br />  Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She had<br />  belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her wishes<br />  fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in his mad<br />  love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>  Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have<br />  meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even<br />  Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters where<br />  he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>  Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's daughter<br />  it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan the way she<br />  did.</p>
<p>  Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else<br />  thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to<br />  unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<p>    Dear Sumeetha...</p>
<p>    Well done. The case was well-thought out and well presented.:-<br />  ) (I've<br />    got a doubt though- I was of the impression that the Veerapandian<br />  who had an<br />    affaire with Mandakini -I'm pretty sure that Nandini was<br />  Veerapandian's<br />    daughter- and the Veerapandian who died at the hands of Aditha<br />  Karikalan<br />    were one and the same...this is the first I've ever heard about<br />  the<br />    'brother' theory.)</p>
<p>    I had a discussion on the same subject about a year ago with<br />  another PS<br />    fanatic. To my question about Nandini's origins, I got the reply<br />  that she<br />    was undoubtedly Vaarapandian's daughter. The reasoning went like<br />  this...</p>
<p>    1) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would<br />  never fall in<br />    love with any one in a space of few days (like a wounded<br />  Veerapandian after<br />    math of the Madurai por). Assuming that she knew something of her<br />  parentage<br />    by then, this would amount to a classical "Electra complex" case<br />  study.</p>
<p>    2) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would go to any<br />  length -<br />    even to calling her father her lover - for attaining what she<br />  wants.</p>
<p>    3) The chronology. Even though Kalki muddles up in the chronology,<br />  there is<br />    clearly a gap of two years between, the parting of Sundara Cholar-<br />  Mandagini<br />    and the birth of the twins in Pazhayarai. And these two years are<br />  filled up<br />    with the Payithiyakaran a.k.a Karuthiruman account.</p>
<p>    4) The Karuthiruman story - Here he clearly states that he picked<br />  up both<br />    Mandagini and Veerapandian in his "odam" and left them together in<br />  northern<br />    Lanka when he went to Rohanam with Veera Pandiyan's message to<br />  Mahindan. And<br />    when he returned he found Mandagini pregnant. This not-so-subtle<br />  information<br />    confirms, Veerapandian as the father of mandagini?s twins.</p>
<p>    5) The nature of the novel. Even though p.s is a magnum opus, it<br />  suffers<br />    from a serious flaw - it was serialized and it is handicapped with<br />  all the<br />    trappings of a Thodarkadhai. So when in the first pagam,<br />  in "Nandiniyin<br />    kadhalan", Kalki reveals a sensational item that of Nandini being<br />  Veera<br />    Pandiyan?s lover. In my opinion this is a standard trick of thodar<br />  kadhai<br />    genre to sustain reader interest - Kalki would have got no<br />  inclination about<br />    how big or how long the novel was going to be at that time. Later<br />  some two<br />    years later, he could have decided to make Nandini the daughter<br />  and not the<br />    lover of Veerapandian as he originally intended.</p>
<p>    6) There is one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian was<br />  her<br />    father,when he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back<br />  at him for<br />    abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house,<br />  she does<br />    what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else<br />  her lover,<br />    so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri at that person - in this<br />  case<br />    VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took revenge on her father for<br />  leaving<br />    her mother destitute. Later when she grieves for her father, she<br />    conveniently forgets that she is the primary reason for his death<br />  and swears<br />    vengeance on the cholas. This school of thought is advocated by<br />  the section<br />    that view Nandini as an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil<br />  villi<br />    character who just wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her.</p>
<p>    7) The case for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan?s lover is weak.<br />  Abathudavi's<br />    claim that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi before he<br />  died. This<br />    could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing here as his<br />  progeny (the<br />    Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have told him). Thinking of<br />  a way to<br />    include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her<br />  as the<br />    patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the<br />  continuing<br />    confrontation against the cholas after his time. He doesn?t know<br />  whether his<br />    official heirs have survived (like the kuzhandai vandiyathevan<br />  meets). So he<br />    makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to the Pandiyan cause.</p>
<p>    Well, what does everybody think?</p>
<p>    I also thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or<br />  is she<br />    merely a victim of circumstance??? I've certain arguments there<br />  too...what<br />    do you think, Sumi?</p>
<p>    Ciaow...<br />    Pavithra.</p>

<p>--------------------<br />Reposting Message 148 / 8.7.2002 by Sumeetha Vijayaraghavan :</p>
<p>Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based on<br />the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how to<br />start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to begin<br />this series with a question which pops in all our minds while we read<br />this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by any<br />author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the entire<br />novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we get to know<br />a new facet about her character and equally a new secret about her<br />life.</p>
<p>Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images that<br />this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery woman in<br />a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. When<br />Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she<br />presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After listening<br />to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a helpless girl who<br />was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but when Vandiya Devan<br />meets her for the first time she appears to be powerful woman with a<br />fleet of servants to do her bidding and she also wields enough power<br />to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally<br />beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her<br />beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is<br />certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the<br />novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her<br />little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick<br />puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava<br />Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is<br />unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>The war of will between these two characters is beautiful.<br />flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan<br />escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the<br />reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the<br />wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies<br />who want avenge their king's death.</p>
<p>Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic images<br />of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an unfortunate<br />woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure<br />that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it<br />Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion<br />because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after<br />Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman<br />saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her memory<br />and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues<br />Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the<br />Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall<br />in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him?</p>
<p>Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to<br />Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan.<br />Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani,<br />Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of<br />Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not recognize<br />him?</p>
<p>The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two individuals<br />after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends Karuthiruman as a<br />messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi Karai by her<br />father. But when he arrives there he finds that Mandakini has had<br />another accident with result her memory is back. Now she does not<br />recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not know what happened<br />to her from the time she fell from the lighthouse and her last<br />accident.</p>
<p>Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? Was<br />he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles<br />Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally<br />beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we<br />assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly because<br />I cannot imagine what other business a king like Veerapandiyan would<br />have with her. And that too, a king who has been ousted from his<br />kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to rally support. One would<br />think that he has lots of things in mind other than to wonder about<br />an unfortunate woman with whom he had traveled for a short while<br />unless he had developed a special love or affection for her. Only<br />that could have prompted him find out what happened to her.</p>
<p>Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to<br />her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman<br />finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in Chola<br />household but before he could get this information to the king he is<br />captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that she was<br />pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to their<br />mother.</p>
<p>Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that<br />Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the<br />Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref:<br /><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is also<br />possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22 years<br />before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. Either way<br />we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's daughter.</p>
<p>The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of<br />Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to<br />suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the<br />Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to<br />Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must note.<br />When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he starts with<br />a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some imagination as well<br />along with the story?" Now which part of it is imagination is<br />difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to<br />Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of Nandini's<br />friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to Pandya<br />Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and<br />Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody to<br />wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes place<br />the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's house. And<br />Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the Chola<br />soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at the<br />Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by Kundavai? Or<br />was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was her father?<br />What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? I<br />am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that<br />Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have<br />told her so as well.</p>
<p>But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that<br />Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the<br />presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she<br />have declared that if she had known that he is her father?<br />Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had<br />realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her<br />brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any<br />logic!</p>
<p>Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him if<br />he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she needn't<br />have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had plainly put<br />across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and that might have<br />done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a mad rage.<br />Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She had<br />belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her wishes<br />fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in his mad<br />love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have<br />meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even<br />Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters where<br />he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's daughter<br />it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan the way she<br />did.</p>
<p>Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else<br />thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to<br />unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Sumeetha...</p>
<p>  Well done. The case was well-thought out and well presented.:-<br />) (I've <br />  got a doubt though- I was of the impression that the Veerapandian <br />who had an <br />  affaire with Mandakini -I'm pretty sure that Nandini was <br />Veerapandian's <br />  daughter- and the Veerapandian who died at the hands of Aditha <br />Karikalan <br />  were one and the same...this is the first I've ever heard about <br />the <br />  'brother' theory.)</p>
<p>  I had a discussion on the same subject about a year ago with <br />another PS <br />  fanatic. To my question about Nandini's origins, I got the reply <br />that she <br />  was undoubtedly Vaarapandian's daughter. The reasoning went like <br />this...</p>
<p>  1) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would <br />never fall in <br />  love with any one in a space of few days (like a wounded <br />Veerapandian after <br />  math of the Madurai por). Assuming that she knew something of her <br />parentage <br />  by then, this would amount to a classical "Electra complex" case <br />study.</p>
<p>  2) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would go to any <br />length - <br />  even to calling her father her lover - for attaining what she <br />wants.</p>
<p>  3) The chronology. Even though Kalki muddles up in the chronology, <br />there is <br />  clearly a gap of two years between, the parting of Sundara Cholar- <br />Mandagini <br />  and the birth of the twins in Pazhayarai. And these two years are <br />filled up <br />  with the Payithiyakaran a.k.a Karuthiruman account.</p>
<p>  4) The Karuthiruman story - Here he clearly states that he picked <br />up both <br />  Mandagini and Veerapandian in his "odam" and left them together in <br />northern <br />  Lanka when he went to Rohanam with Veera Pandiyan's message to <br />Mahindan. And <br />  when he returned he found Mandagini pregnant. This not-so-subtle <br />information <br />  confirms, Veerapandian as the father of mandagini?s twins.</p>
<p>  5) The nature of the novel. Even though p.s is a magnum opus, it <br />suffers <br />  from a serious flaw - it was serialized and it is handicapped with <br />all the <br />  trappings of a Thodarkadhai. So when in the first pagam, <br />in "Nandiniyin <br />  kadhalan", Kalki reveals a sensational item that of Nandini being <br />Veera <br />  Pandiyan?s lover. In my opinion this is a standard trick of thodar <br />kadhai <br />  genre to sustain reader interest - Kalki would have got no <br />inclination about <br />  how big or how long the novel was going to be at that time. Later <br />some two <br />  years later, he could have decided to make Nandini the daughter <br />and not the <br />  lover of Veerapandian as he originally intended.</p>
<p>  6) There is one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian was <br />her <br />  father,when he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back <br />at him for <br />  abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, <br />she does <br />  what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else <br />her lover, <br />  so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri at that person - in this <br />case <br />  VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took revenge on her father for <br />leaving <br />  her mother destitute. Later when she grieves for her father, she <br />  conveniently forgets that she is the primary reason for his death <br />and swears <br />  vengeance on the cholas. This school of thought is advocated by <br />the section <br />  that view Nandini as an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil <br />villi <br />  character who just wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her.</p>
<p>  7) The case for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan?s lover is weak. <br />Abathudavi's <br />  claim that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi before he <br />died. This <br />  could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing here as his <br />progeny (the <br />  Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have told him). Thinking of <br />a way to <br />  include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her <br />as the <br />  patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the <br />continuing <br />  confrontation against the cholas after his time. He doesn?t know <br />whether his <br />  official heirs have survived (like the kuzhandai vandiyathevan <br />meets). So he <br />  makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to the Pandiyan cause.</p>
<p>  Well, what does everybody think?</p>
<p>  I also thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or <br />is she <br />  merely a victim of circumstance??? I've certain arguments there <br />too...what <br />  do you think, Sumi?</p>
<p>  Ciaow...<br />  Pavithra.</p>

          The Nandini Conundrum...        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sumeetha...</p>
<p>Sorry for the rather long gap- but I'm back anyway.:-)</p>
<p>Your views gave me a good deal of food for thought- I found myself <br />doing a lot of thinking on what you've said.</p>
<p>About what you've said about Nandhini exacting her revenge by marrying <br />Karikalan- I though of another view-point. Most of the times, the <br />daughter-in-law of a household weilds power only in name- she's generally <br />expected to keep back and do what her husband/mother-in-law tells her. The <br />real power, sometimes lies with the daughter of the house-in this case, <br />Kundhavai. Kundavai is not just the daughter of the Chola emperor, but she's <br />very popular with the masses too, and held in great esteem by her people. <br />Nandhini would be thrown into the shadow, while Kundhavai would still retain <br />her prominence. In essence, she may not have been able to get her revenge at <br />all. What do you think?</p>
<blockquote><p> On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either her father or <br /> brother. Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she had deliberately <br /> turned Karikalan's anger on him. Why?</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you mean, why she made Karikalan kill Veerapandian?</p>
<p>For one thing, she is of the opinion that Karikalan jilted her- in her heart <br />of hearts, she wanted him to win her back in spite of opposition. When he <br />didn't do it, she became furious. And what better way to take her revenge <br />than to make him kill her supposed lover Veerapandian (who was already <br />three-fourths dead anyway, and wouldn't have survived) in a fit of anger <br />(notice: she knows exactly how karikalan will react after he commits the <br />deed of killing her 'beloved' and knows that he will regret it because he <br />has hurt her terribly) then blame him forever?</p>
<p>Personally, its my opinion that Nandhini didn't care much about the Pandya <br />Kingdom either. *She* had been hurt by the Cholas and been humiliated by <br />them, therefore she decided to hurt them as much as she could, notably <br />Karikalan.</p>
<p>Well...what do you think?</p>
<p>BTW, Imli, your photos are cool:-) (How are your studies going on?)</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing more from you guys,</p>
<p>Pavithra.</p>

        <p>Hai All,<br />Its happy to know that efforts are being made to get PS in web.Recently Dr <br />V.Krishnamoorthy (Former anna university Professor) released a tamil OCR <br />named PONVIZHI.I think this will help people who are involved in converting <br />PS to e-version.The first hand opinion of the OCR seems to be <br />satisfactory.Even they had tested this with Anandarangam Pillai's biography <br />and its looks pretty good.He can be contacted at.</p>
<p>Dr V Krishnamoorthy<br />Inforeed,<br />11, Fourth Street,<br />Padmanabha Nagar, Adayar,<br />Chennai 600 020<br />Tel: +91 44 446173</p>

<p> Hi Pavithra,</p>
<p> The angle about Veerapandiyan being Nandini's brother was suggested by Ram<br /> in one of his threads here. I think I have given the thread there. I guess<br /> we can consider the possibility because if Veerapandiyan senior (the one <br /> who<br /> met Karuthiruman and Mandakini) is the same one killed by Karikalan then we<br /> can expect him to quite old. I guess it is difficult for think that she<br /> would have fallen in love with him.</p>
<p> But Nandini as a character has puzzled me a lot for various reasons -</p>
<p> If she wanted to take revenge on the Cholas or especially Kundavai for <br /> their<br /> treatment towards her the best revenge would be to marry Karikalan. Being<br /> the elder brother's wife I am sure we can expect Kundavai to be subservient<br /> to her in position and power. Yet she goes ahead and spoils it all by<br /> telling karikalan that she had fallen in love with the wounded man.</p>
<p> Did she do it just to scorn Karikalan? To show him - "You have all the <br /> power<br /> in the world but I would prefer to marry a wounded and defeated king than<br /> become your wife and a part of your arrogant family" Is this what she<br /> thought?</p>
<p> On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either her father or <br /> brother.<br /> Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she had deliberately turned<br /> Karikalan's anger on him. Why?</p>
<p> "Electra's complex" - quite possible. It can also be a deep yearning to be <br /> a<br /> part of something important and dangerous. Like she sees herself as a<br /> heroine liberating, avenging and taking up responsibilities for an entire<br /> kingdom.</p>
<p> We should also not forget that her revenge is a double edged sword both on<br /> Veerapandiyan and Karikalan. She turned Karikalan's anger on Veerapandiyan<br /> because she felt that he had abandoned her mother and herself therefore he<br /> got his head cut off and in the same time she took revenge on Karikalan for<br /> allowing Sembiyanmadevi to send her away.</p>
<p> In many ways her revenge on Veerapandiyan was milder because it was<br /> Karikalan who had to bear the guilt of his actions which was a bigger<br /> revenge.</p>

<p>   Dear Sumeetha...</p>
<p>    Well done. The case was well-thought out and well presented.:-) <br /> (I've<br />   got a doubt though- I was of the impression that the Veerapandian who had<br />   an<br />   affaire with Mandakini -I'm pretty sure that Nandini was Veerapandian's<br />   daughter- and the Veerapandian who died at the hands of Aditha Karikalan<br />   were one and the same...this is the first I've ever heard about the<br />   'brother' theory.)</p>
<p>    I had a discussion on the same subject about a year ago with another<br />   PS<br />   fanatic. To my question about Nandini's origins, I got the reply that she<br />   was undoubtedly Vaarapandian's daughter. The reasoning went like this...</p>
<p>    1) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would never fall<br />   in<br />   love with any one in a space of few days (like a wounded Veerapandian <br /> after<br />   math of the Madurai por). Assuming that she knew something of her <br /> parentage<br />   by then, this would amount to a classical "Electra complex" case study.</p>
<p>   2) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would go to any length <br /> -<br />   even to calling her father her lover - for attaining what she wants.</p>
<p>   3) The chronology. Even though Kalki muddles up in the chronology, there <br /> is<br />   clearly a gap of two years between, the parting of Sundara Cholar-<br />   Mandagini<br />   and the birth of the twins in Pazhayarai. And these two years are filled <br /> up<br />   with the Payithiyakaran a.k.a Karuthiruman account.</p>
<p>   4) The Karuthiruman story - Here he clearly states that he picked up both<br />   Mandagini and Veerapandian in his "odam" and left them together in <br /> northern<br />   Lanka when he went to Rohanam with Veera Pandiyan's message to Mahindan.<br />   And<br />   when he returned he found Mandagini pregnant. This not-so-subtle<br />   information<br />   confirms, Veerapandian as the father of mandagini&#146;s twins.</p>
<p>   5) The nature of the novel. Even though p.s is a magnum opus, it suffers<br />   from a serious flaw - it was serialized and it is handicapped with all <br /> the<br />   trappings of a Thodarkadhai. So when in the first pagam, in "Nandiniyin<br />   kadhalan", Kalki reveals a sensational item that of Nandini being Veera<br />   Pandiyan&#146;s lover. In my opinion this is a standard trick of thodar kadhai<br />   genre to sustain reader interest - Kalki would have got no inclination<br />   about<br />   how big or how long the novel was going to be at that time. Later some <br /> two<br />   years later, he could have decided to make Nandini the daughter and not <br /> the<br />   lover of Veerapandian as he originally intended.</p>
<p>   6) There is one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian was her<br />   father,when he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back at him<br />   for<br />   abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, she <br /> does<br />   what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else her <br /> lover,<br />   so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri at that person - in this case<br />   VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took revenge on her father for leaving<br />   her mother destitute. Later when she grieves for her father, she<br />   conveniently forgets that she is the primary reason for his death and<br />   swears<br />   vengeance on the cholas. This school of thought is advocated by the <br /> section<br />   that view Nandini as an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi<br />   character who just wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her.</p>
<p>   7) The case for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan&#146;s lover is weak. <br /> Abathudavi's<br />   claim that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi before he died. <br /> This<br />   could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing here as his progeny (the<br />   Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have told him). Thinking of a way <br /> to<br />   include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her as the<br />   patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the continuing<br />   confrontation against the cholas after his time. He doesn&#146;t know whether<br />   his<br />   official heirs have survived (like the kuzhandai vandiyathevan meets). So<br />   he<br />   makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to the Pandiyan cause.</p>
<p>   Well, what does everybody think?</p>
<p>   I also thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or is she<br />   merely a victim of circumstance??? I've certain arguments there <br /> too...what<br />   do you think, Sumi?</p>
<p>   Ciaow...<br />   Pavithra.</p>
