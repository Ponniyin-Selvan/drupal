<blockquote><p>    And Sivaram's and SPS's mail about vivekananda - Vivekananda took <br />    sanyasa, when his father had died, family was in debts, starving <br />  for <br />    one meal a day etc. </p></blockquote>
<p>Dear Satish / members</p>
<p>It is true that when swami vivekananda took sanyaasa, his family was<br />not in good shape. He and few of the core disciples of SriRamakrishna<br />took sanyaas only after the death of their master.</p>
<p>Vivekananda's family continued to suffer. Swamiji spent some time much<br />later with his mother - but other than that there was nothing he could<br />do for his own family. When ramakrishna repeatedly asked to pray to<br />mother kali for money, all young naren could wish for was knowledge<br />and thirst for ultimate - not money !</p>
<p>Same is the case with Adhi Shankara. He just came for the last moments<br />of his mother and did her final rites</p>
<p>Sri Raghavendra had to desert his wife who committed suicide. Later on<br />he blessed her soul and that is what is today celebrated as "Sumangali<br />prarthanai" after marriages. On that day alone, ladies eat first :-)<br />and men eat later.</p>
<p>Sri Ramanuja also had to desert his wife.</p>
<p>This needs to be viewed with a different perspective of mind.</p>
<p>Rgds<br />Gokul.S</p>

<p>  I think the reason why Vivekanada and Buddha and others like him are<br />  revered even after so many years is that, they<br />  belived in their ideals and dared to do it in their day today life. Only a<br />  very few could dare to do what they really belive in.<br />  That is why even when some criticize them for their actions many see them<br />  as God.</p>

<p>      I dont my questions are unfounded. Its pretty simple why do you have<br />      to make a bunch of folks suffer in order to search for the ultimate. God is<br />      defintely in our duties..if u dont feed you take care of your parents then<br />      there is not greater sin atleast that is what i have learnt.<br />      I think the truth is that the teachings of these great souls are so<br />      invaluable to us that we tend to overlook thier other side.<br />      Im sorry but these are not my excuses because i cant escape the grind<br />      of everyday life....these are my questions to those souls who had shirked<br />      thier responsibilities and gone on to search for god.<br />      Seeing his wife and kid on the cot i dont think Gautama's thought<br />      would have been as you have put it..it would have been a doubt on how the<br />      world would treat his wife and son after he leaves.</p>
<p>      Im of the opinion that taking care of your dependents without<br />      expecting anything out of them, like all our parents have done, is a greater<br />      deed than leaving your family and going in search of god.</p>

<p>          This is something i have never understood probably because i am<br />          a normal person when compared to these great souls. If a person wants to<br />          search for the ultimate for the rest of his life then he is definitely<br />          entitled to do so and that probably what makes them great. But why do you<br />          have to get married, bear children and the leave them to the mercy of this<br />          world. The girl was married to this person as the girl's parents believed<br />          that he would take good care of her. By becoming a sanyas or a rebel you are<br />          actually making a whole bunch of people suffer (wife,kids,inlaws,etc,etc)<br />          and then you are searching for god. God is in your duties..</p>
<p>        God is in our duties... really? how can you be so sure? Aw, nah...<br />        dont quote the geeta please... am asking what makes you convinced... not<br />        biblical references...</p>
<p>        if you have not performed your duties then how do you expect god<br />          to accept you?</p>
<p>        What makes you so sure he wont?</p>
<p>        Please note im not questioning the greatness of these souls or<br />          thier teachings im just asking why do they make a whole bunch of people<br />          suffer when they go after whatever they seek? Why dont they remain<br />          unmarried..</p>
<p>        Lets for a minute say that you suddenly get that quest, which<br />        presupposes that attachment will not get you anywhere... will you wait<br />        until you make that money for your family?

Just my<br />        two cents worth.</p>
<p>        earn a small sum of money which would take care of thier parents<br />          for the erst of thier remaining lives and then go and seek god. God would<br />          definitely accept them with open arms.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I think the reason why Vivekanada and Buddha and others like him are revered<br />even after so many years is that, they<br />belived in their ideals and dared to do it in their day today life. Only a<br />very few could dare to do what they really belive in.<br />That is why even when some criticize them for their actions many see them as<br />God.</p>

<p>      earn a small sum of money which would take care of thier parents for<br />        the erst of thier remaining lives and then go and seek god. God would<br />        definitely accept them with open arms.</p>

        <p>During the freedom struggle thousands left thier families and went to fight<br />for our country. Even Gandhi neglected his family to free our country.<br />I think even though at that particular moment the deed of one leaving his<br />dependents without support doesn't look good..once these great souls attain<br />whatever they have searched for that deed tends to get justified. the end<br />justifies the means...</p>

<p>  earn a small sum of money which would take care of thier parents for the<br />    erst of thier remaining lives and then go and seek god. God would definitely<br />    accept them with open arms.</p>

<p>Hi Gokul, After long time.. nice. sps</p>
<blockquote><p>      And Sivaram's and SPS's mail about vivekananda - Vivekananda took <br />      sanyasa, when his father had died, family was in debts, starving <br />    for <br />      one meal a day etc. </p>
<p>  Dear Satish / members</p>
<p>  It is true that when swami vivekananda took sanyaasa, his family was<br />  not in good shape. He and few of the core disciples of SriRamakrishna<br />  took sanyaas only after the death of their master.</p>
<p>  Vivekananda's family continued to suffer. Swamiji spent some time much<br />  later with his mother - but other than that there was nothing he could<br />  do for his own family. When ramakrishna repeatedly asked to pray to<br />  mother kali for money, all young naren could wish for was knowledge<br />  and thirst for ultimate - not money !</p>
<p>  Same is the case with Adhi Shankara. He just came for the last moments<br />  of his mother and did her final rites</p>
<p>  Sri Raghavendra had to desert his wife who committed suicide. Later on<br />  he blessed her soul and that is what is today celebrated as "Sumangali<br />  prarthanai" after marriages. On that day alone, ladies eat first :-)<br />  and men eat later.</p>
<p>  Sri Ramanuja also had to desert his wife.</p>
<p>  This needs to be viewed with a different perspective of mind.</p>

        <p>sorry got trigger happy before completing the sentence.... :)</p>
<p>Sorry, I dont mean to offend... its just that some statements here are<br />unfounded... the moment you are able to see the statements are just<br />lame excuses of souls like us caught in the grind of the daily life,<br />you will at least understand why these men felt justified in 'fleeing'<br />thier homes....</p>
<p>I can literally see Buddha saying to himself, watching his wife and<br />kid sleep, just before he left...</p>
<p>"Better late than too late"</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>
<p>PS: This is in a way similar to people who try to quit smoking... that<br />last cigarette is never the last... worldly attachment is the same...<br />no day can be good enough to quit... I remember telling my<br />friends(when I was yonger and more ignorant ;) that I dont want to<br />suffer old age and would kill myself on my 50th birthday. But now<br />(when am a little older and a little more arrogant) I think 60 would<br />just be the right age... any guesses what I would be thinking on my<br />60th birthday?</p>

<p>  Same is the case with Adhi Shankara. He just came for the last moments<br />  of his mother and did her final rites</p>
<p>  Sri Raghavendra had to desert his wife who committed suicide. Later on<br />  he blessed her soul and that is what is today celebrated as "Sumangali<br />  prarthanai" after marriages. On that day alone, ladies eat first :-)<br />  and men eat later.</p>
<p>  Sri Ramanuja also had to desert his wife.</p>
<p>  This needs to be viewed with a different perspective of mind.</p>
