        <p>Hi VJ,</p>
<p>You may be right. The Chola coins ( or even the<br />Pallava coins ) dont compare well with that of<br />Greek/Roman coins minted thousand years ago. For that<br />matter, even with our own Gupta / Kanishka coins (<br />Which were perhaps modelled over the Greek/Roman<br />ones.) </p>
<p>Why did the people that pioneer the "Chola Bronze"<br />technology didnt do so well with the coins? The <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym <br />"Octopus man" coins are reported to be modelled out of<br />Ceylon coins. The <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  or Uttama Chola coins are only<br />the better of the lot.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>May be the embossing was lost, since in olden days<br />they used to strike the coin against stone and<br />distinguish original/fake from the sound made?</p>
<p>More research &amp; hoards needed! I will later try to<br />scan and post some coins I think better.</p>

<p>    Hi,</p>
<p>    I agree &amp; disagree with you.</p>
<p>    The Cankam age Pandian coins were detailed enough.<br />  But<br />    most of the coins found today are from the river<br />  beds<br />    and totally eroded. But you can still see the<br />    beautifully carved elephant and the 5 mangala<br />  signs<br />    clearly in most of these completely eroded coins.</p>
<p>  we need to give credit when its due.</p>
<p>  without quoting names, during one of our private<br />  interactions - a <br />  chola coin artwork / contemporary depiction was<br />  being discussed. The <br />  chola tiger on the throne was compared to a cheshire<br />  cat....</p>

<p>        I agree with what you have written. My point was that (and <br />here <br />  I<br />    agree with<br />        Richard Dawkins) is that in a sense our bodies<br />        are vehicles for the genes. Hence, we could build hapmaps <br />using<br />    any gene of<br />        interest. You are right in that the Y chromosome and the<br />    mitochondrial DNA<br />        can help us be a little "surer" of where we come from.. but <br />that<br />    helps only<br />        if one is looking at our evolution as Humans. What about <br />before<br />    that? The<br />        book by Dawkins "The Ancestor's Tale" is fascinating in that <br />he <br />  traces<br />        evolution back through several millenia. And hence, if one <br />  accepts<br />    evolution<br />        as the best theory that can explain observed phenomenon, then<br />    70,000 years<br />        is really nothing special :)</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I agree &amp; disagree with you.</p>
<p>The Cankam age Pandian coins were detailed enough. But<br />most of the coins found today are from the river beds<br />and totally eroded. But you can still see the<br />beautifully carved elephant and the 5 mangala signs<br />clearly in most of these completely eroded coins.</p>
<p>The Cera coins of the same period show a relevance to<br />the Greek/Roman coins and portrait the bust of the<br />king in a simillar manner and eroded though.</p>
<p>We need better samples from this Cankam age. The<br />contemporary Satavahana coins are better preserved and<br />show a greater detail with Brahmi scripts often.</p>
<p>Post that period and until the Pallava era, we dont<br />have any samples of coinage in TN. Some of the Pallava<br />coins are so good. I could get hold of only 1 tiny<br />Pallava coin so far. This coin is very tiny that it<br />can be blown away with a simple breath.</p>
<p>Then comes the Chola era. For the cost of a pizza you<br />can buy a handful of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  copper coins in<br />www.eBay.co.in and own a part of Chola history. These<br />coins are called as "octopus man" coins, because of<br />the way the king is struck there! What a name they<br />have given to our <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym !</p>
<p>The aboundance of the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  copper coins simply shows<br />the monetary power of the Cholas. These type of coins<br />were perhaps in circulation for say 300-400 years or<br />so.</acronym></p>
<p>The octopus man copper coins are good, but the<br />detailing is not clear. May be most of them are fake<br />or eroded due to centuries of continuous usage.<br />Perhaps they were cheap coins minted for volume usage.</p>
<p>The "Yuddha Malla" silver / gold coins of <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  are<br />beautifully detailed. These are some of the good<br />samples of Chola coinage. The Kulothunga coins are<br />also good samples.</acronym></p>
<p>The Pandian copper coins of the same era are simillar<br />to the octopus man coins and most of them are eroded.</p>
<p>Post this period, some how the Tamils lost the<br />technology of minting coins. We see poorly struck<br />coins of the Nayaks and other local chieftians.</p>
<p>The next wave of coins come after the European era.<br />Pudukottai Amman coins &amp; coins of the Trivancore kings<br />are good samples which are properly die struck.</p>
<p>Probably during a next <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  meeting, I can ask Mr. Raman<br />to present to our group about Tamil coinage.</acronym></p>
<p>Thanks for bringing up and best regards,</p>

<p>  interesting read. one thing surprises me, is the<br />  level of <br />  sophistication in their coins - compared to ours -<br />  if you go as per <br />  the dates suggested - they predate ours chola coins<br />  by more than a few <br />  centuries...</p></blockquote>

        <p>I agree.. I think what I failed to realize and what struck me only after<br />someone pointed it out here<br />is that archaeologists work on much smaller time scales compared to<br />evolutionary biologists :)</p>
<p>However, from a cultural standpoint, even finding a mitochondrial eve at<br />70000 years might be useless..</p>

        <p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>(You can call me Raghu...) :)</p>
<p>In a way yes. It all depends on what we are looking at? Right from the<br />beginning of life formation or after a certain point of time or an in<br />between age.. With the limited knowledge and tools, people are trying<br />to uncover <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  by <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym ...lets see if for humans, is the picture<br />becoming clearer or not.</acronym></p>

<p>  You too?:) (Please call me Arun btw).</p>
<p>  I agree with what you have written. My point was that (and here I<br />agree with<br />  Richard Dawkins) is that in a sense our bodies<br />  are vehicles for the genes. Hence, we could build hapmaps using any<br />gene of<br />  interest. You are right in that the Y chromosome and the<br />mitochondrial DNA<br />  can help us be a little "surer" of where we come from.. but that<br />helps only<br />  if one is looking at our evolution as Humans. What about before<br />that? The<br />  book by Dawkins "The Ancestor's Tale" is fascinating in that he traces<br />  evolution back through several millenia. And hence, if one accepts<br />evolution<br />  as the best theory that can explain observed phenomenon, then 70,000<br />years<br />  is really nothing special :)</p>

<p>    Great to see another computational biologist in this forum. Hi Dr.<br />    Arun. :)</p>
<p>    Yes you are right that there are three different migrations out of<br />    Africa traced out on the basis of mitochondrial DNA. The common thing<br />    that the three different routes have is that all the three have same<br />    root in Africa. So no one is counter arguing the point that we came<br />    from Africa.</p>
<p>    But in your whole argument, you say that any gene can be a marker. I<br />    think you are not taking a major point into consideration. In Y<br />    chromosome, majority of the genes taking part in recombination is very<br />    very less almost nil. In other words, the gene in Y wouldnt have<br />    changed so much from the ancestor say 80,000 yrs ago. So, it is quite<br />    easier to see from where the gene has traveled. In other words, using<br />    any gene from my Y chromosome, I can trace back my ancestors. A Human<br />    Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup is a haplogroup defined by differences in<br />    the non-recombining portions of DNA from the Y chromosome (called<br />Y-DNA).</p>
<p>    Now the other chromosomal genes undergo more recombination events from<br />    both maternal and paternal side. Hence, I cant really say where the<br />    gene came from after few ancestoral generations...It gets more<br />    complicated and fuzzy.<br />    Also, here no one is trying to pinpoint one person in Africa as the<br />    ancestor..they are trying to pinpoint say a group of people/community<br />    from where say one guy was a rebel and he took his family for greener<br />    pastures :)</p>
<p>    Choice of a gene for tracing the root is subjective, I agree as there<br />    are more than one gene that can be studied in Y. At the same time,<br />    selection of chromosome is not subjective. Say Y chromosome or<br />    mitochondrial DNA. Thats why people are studying those two DNA<br />    population...</p>
<p>    One thing I would say is M130 is not the only haplotype or marker..<br />    (this is being hyped by the media) there are others as well. The<br />    common thing is it is from Y or mitochondrial DNA and not from other<br />    chromosomes.</p>
<p>    As said before, other genes cannot answer the question "Where we<br />    originated from?" Adding to that, one is trying to answer the question<br />    from Y chromosome/mtDNA "If from single ancestor, how did we travel to<br />    other parts of the world?".....</p>
<p>    I hope this clears lot of things....</p>

<p>      Satish,<br />      As I mentioned, there is no one single person all of us can trace<br />    back to.<br />      We can always go back further in time<br />      and trace each of our genes to different individuals. Hence, to me,<br />    all this<br />      talk of one single ancestor 70,000 years ago is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>      By the way, the dominant hypothesis states that there were not just<br />    one, but<br />      two or more migrations out of Africa spread over thousands of years.<br />    SO yes,<br />      if you go way back, all of us can probably trace some part of our<br />    genome to<br />      some African ancestors.<br />      [</p>

<p>        Hello everyone,</p>
<p>        This is a very interesting thread and thanks for all the<br />information<br />        and links! Another recent work on DNA and history was when<br />        archeologists in Lebanon found an ancient Phoenician site with DNA<br />        material. They were able to analyze the DNA and find that<br />people in<br />        Lebanon, Malta and Syria shared this DNA (irrespective of their<br />        religion). This was actually also practically useful as it helped<br />        dispel some politically motivated myths about<br />        who (Lebanese Muslims or Christians) were the true descendants<br />of the<br />        Phoenicians.</p>

<p>          Its very interesting to see a genetic discussion in this<br />group. As a<br />          molecular biologist I thought I'll add my 2 cents worth.</p>
<p>          For a start all nuclear genomes (from microbes to plants and<br />humans)<br />          have genes and non-genic region. The non-genic region being<br />the bulk<br />          of genome about 98% in humans. so ppl who believe that we can<br />    replace<br />          gene x and y and make a whole new species are grossly mistaken.</p>
<p>          markers on the genome can be genes(as was pointed out<br />earlier), a<br />          short stretch of code sometimes even just 1 base(or letter).<br />    these are<br />          changes that happened during evolution that can be tracked.<br />    These are<br />          not chosen b'cos someone likes them, but have stood various<br />    panels of<br />          tests and have provided consistent results.</p>
<p>          For people in the it industry imagine this to be a comment line<br />    in the<br />          legacy source code of version 10 of the S/W. if u see it all<br />the way<br />          up to version 1.5 then that is where it was introduced (even<br />though<br />          back then it might have been doing a different role)</p>
<p>          Even though the difference between human and chimp is just 1.5%,<br />    thats<br />          1.5% of 3.2 billion and all that difference is not concentrated<br />    at one<br />          place. Also these changes did not happen overnight it has taken<br />          millions of years to make them better survive in their<br />environment.</p>
<p>          In most cases the genes across species (from mouse to man) are<br />    pretty<br />          much the same, u can technically replace one with the other and<br />    won't<br />          see any difference in them. Its primarily the regulation<br />(when and<br />          where and how they are used) makes all the difference.</p>
<p>          think of it like 2 people cooking with the same set of<br />ingredients,<br />          the out come can be very different depending upon when what<br />and how<br />          much of any given component is used.</p>
<p>          hope this helps</p>

        <p>Theories are always confusing. I too dont belive in much of these. </p>
<p>Egyptian pyramids which are around 5000 to 10000 years old - <br />considered to be the epitome of human civilization.. </p>
<p>aprart from other very few civilization, the Indus valey civilization <br />is considered to be one of the advanced and Indian civilization based <br />on this is considered to be the only surviving oldest civilization.</p>
<p>Egyptian pyramids have sculptors and figures and pictures, which are <br />stil clear with distinct features. The eyes, nose - as we say in <br />Tamil 'Thiruthamana' art. But the artifacts we get in Indus valey <br />civilization - even difficult to figure out what it is. Later again <br />the art flourishes from around 600 AD - mamallapuram, kanchi - we <br />dont have evidences in north india as everything has been erased due <br />to invasion</p>
<p>Considering the events in sequence - as a general trait of human <br />civilization, best (Egypt) to ok (indus) to great (pallava) to - <br />again today we dont have any artisan who can match tohse <br />perfection.....</p>
<p>Everything is a cycle. Necessity is the mother of invention. I dont <br />belive in saying that humans came into existence 70000 years ago and <br />for 60000 years they were trying to invent language, fire, wheel etc.</p>
<p>We study samples to come to a conclusin for a larger population. <br />Likewise, an example. MY father is very good in carpentery, electical <br />work, electronics (not the current form, but till the transistor <br />days. he used to repair our old b/w tv set himself) did almost most <br />of our house wiring himself, good at mechanics, plumbing, <br />masonary...he can mend any minor repairs in our house. </p>
<p>But me, fit for nothing :) dont know anything in the above said.<br />May be my kid will be much worse, because atleast I know how to hold <br />a screw driver, nail with a hammer etc.</p>
<p>A couple of generatins later, when the labour cost in India goes high <br />as in the US, people will start learning things and do it themselves <br />again.</p>
<p>Likewise, civilization also goes up and down. Fixing a date for <br />things and coming up with theories - I just cant take it.</p>
<p>coming to the question of veda's - 2500 years back, buddism started <br />in India but today is found more outside india than in India. But <br />still we have the traces of the religion in India.</p>
<p>Likewise, if Veda started outside India, there should be a trace of <br />it atleast till 1500 years back, because as per theory, its <br />considered to be created around 3500 years back. But the history we <br />have is that even before 2000 years back there was no trace of vedic <br />tint outside India, atleast directly as we see buddist tint now.</p>
<p>So theories are theories and people who belive, lets keep beliving.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

        <p>I am a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  confused by all the theories. <br />According to one theory (which I personally believe so)...<br />India was a part of Africa (along with South america). <br /><a href="http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/continents.html" title="http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/continents.html">http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/continents.html</a></acronym></p>
<p>The truth of growing Himalayas and language strains of african tribes <br />with ancient Tamil. Dna strains of Aborginees to Africans to Indian <br />natives etc.</p>
<p>What puzzles me is that this happened some 65 million years ago, when <br />humans (not homosapiens but startig from Homo habilis) were on earth <br />some 800K years ago. </p>
<p>The real question now is, if the DNA had continued from Africa to <br />other parts of world when continents moved ? if so, how did this <br />whole evolution happen at various spots at various times ?<br />If India was a part of africa, then why could India not have been the <br />crade of life ?</p>
<p>For some reason, I fail to believe or understand the concept of <br />Darwin. Was darwin referring to mutated chimps or similar apes (as in <br />evolution) to man ?</p>
<p>According to vedas or many other religious texts, man's existance <br />came to be, which is supposedly embedded in the very minds of us, <br />trying to find out our real past.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.farshores.org/oom.htm" title="http://www.farshores.org/oom.htm">http://www.farshores.org/oom.htm</a> -- has some convincing points.</p>
<p>Truth is, it is very difficult to find the origins based on westrn <br />ideology alone. </p>

<p>    Dear Ragothaman,</p>
<p>    You too?:) (Please call me Arun btw).</p>
<p>    I agree with what you have written. My point was that (and here I <br />agree with<br />    Richard Dawkins) is that in a sense our bodies<br />    are vehicles for the genes. Hence, we could build hapmaps using <br />any gene of<br />    interest. You are right in that the Y chromosome and the <br />mitochondrial DNA<br />    can help us be a little "surer" of where we come from.. but that <br />helps only<br />    if one is looking at our evolution as Humans. What about before <br />that? The<br />    book by Dawkins "The Ancestor's Tale" is fascinating in that he <br />traces<br />    evolution back through several millenia. And hence, if one <br />accepts evolution<br />    as the best theory that can explain observed phenomenon, then <br />70,000 years<br />    is really nothing special :)</p>

        <p>70,000 years might be nothing for you guys in field of that study. But<br />for us it matters :-)</p>
<p>In the video the University professor mentioned that though we can<br />trace back 70,000 years, the language and other things developed just<br />10,000 years ago. I wonder, what they would have done for 60,000 years<br />:-)</p>
<p>There are religions which believe that God created the world only few<br />thousand years ago and anything early is against it. When Jean<br />Francois Champollion tried to decipher egypt Hieroglyphics the<br />religion gave him permission/funds to go to Egypt on the ground that<br />he shouldn't reveal any truth which is against the religion, at the<br />end he didn't and it was revealed only after his death.</p>

<p>hi<br />evolution is a very logical theory but pity most religions are <br />against it. we 'd like to beleive god made man in his mould.<br />though some claim dasavatharam to be hinduism's acceptance of man <br />evolving from a distant water creature its tough for them to accept <br />that we came from the monkey.</p>
<p>like this american soldier who wants to marry a japenese girl. the <br />suit is rejected on grounds of anscestory.<br />"she is descended from the moon goddess and you from a monkey" they <br />said</p>

<blockquote><p>  Great to see another computational biologist in this forum. Hi Dr.<br />  Arun. :)</p>
<p>  Yes you are right that there are three different migrations out of<br />  Africa traced out on the basis of mitochondrial DNA. The common thing<br />  that the three different routes have is that all the three have same<br />  root in Africa. So no one is counter arguing the point that we came<br />  from Africa.</p>
<p>  But in your whole argument, you say that any gene can be a marker. I<br />  think you are not taking a major point into consideration. In Y<br />  chromosome, majority of the genes taking part in recombination is very<br />  very less almost nil. In other words, the gene in Y wouldnt have<br />  changed so much from the ancestor say 80,000 yrs ago. So, it is quite<br />  easier to see from where the gene has traveled. In other words, using<br />  any gene from my Y chromosome, I can trace back my ancestors. A Human<br />  Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup is a haplogroup defined by differences in<br />  the non-recombining portions of DNA from the Y chromosome (called Y-DNA).</p>
<p>  Now the other chromosomal genes undergo more recombination events from<br />  both maternal and paternal side. Hence, I cant really say where the<br />  gene came from after few ancestoral generations...It gets more<br />  complicated and fuzzy.<br />  Also, here no one is trying to pinpoint one person in Africa as the<br />  ancestor..they are trying to pinpoint say a group of people/community<br />  from where say one guy was a rebel and he took his family for greener<br />  pastures :)</p>
<p>  Choice of a gene for tracing the root is subjective, I agree as there<br />  are more than one gene that can be studied in Y. At the same time,<br />  selection of chromosome is not subjective. Say Y chromosome or<br />  mitochondrial DNA. Thats why people are studying those two DNA<br />  population...</p>
<p>  One thing I would say is M130 is not the only haplotype or marker..<br />  (this is being hyped by the media) there are others as well. The<br />  common thing is it is from Y or mitochondrial DNA and not from other<br />  chromosomes.</p>
<p>  As said before, other genes cannot answer the question "Where we<br />  originated from?" Adding to that, one is trying to answer the question<br />  from Y chromosome/mtDNA "If from single ancestor, how did we travel to<br />  other parts of the world?".....</p>
<p>  I hope this clears lot of things....</p>

<p>    Satish,<br />    As I mentioned, there is no one single person all of us can trace<br />  back to.<br />    We can always go back further in time<br />    and trace each of our genes to different individuals. Hence, to me,<br />  all this<br />    talk of one single ancestor 70,000 years ago is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>    By the way, the dominant hypothesis states that there were not just<br />  one, but<br />    two or more migrations out of Africa spread over thousands of years.<br />  SO yes,<br />    if you go way back, all of us can probably trace some part of our<br />  genome to<br />    some African ancestors.<br />    [</p>

<p>      Hello everyone,</p>
<p>      This is a very interesting thread and thanks for all the information<br />      and links! Another recent work on DNA and history was when<br />      archeologists in Lebanon found an ancient Phoenician site with DNA<br />      material. They were able to analyze the DNA and find that people in<br />      Lebanon, Malta and Syria shared this DNA (irrespective of their<br />      religion). This was actually also practically useful as it helped<br />      dispel some politically motivated myths about<br />      who (Lebanese Muslims or Christians) were the true descendants of the<br />      Phoenicians.</p>

<p>        Its very interesting to see a genetic discussion in this group. As a<br />        molecular biologist I thought I'll add my 2 cents worth.</p>
<p>        For a start all nuclear genomes (from microbes to plants and humans)<br />        have genes and non-genic region. The non-genic region being the bulk<br />        of genome about 98% in humans. so ppl who believe that we can<br />  replace<br />        gene x and y and make a whole new species are grossly mistaken.</p>
<p>        markers on the genome can be genes(as was pointed out earlier), a<br />        short stretch of code sometimes even just 1 base(or letter).<br />  these are<br />        changes that happened during evolution that can be tracked.<br />  These are<br />        not chosen b'cos someone likes them, but have stood various<br />  panels of<br />        tests and have provided consistent results.</p>
<p>        For people in the it industry imagine this to be a comment line<br />  in the<br />        legacy source code of version 10 of the S/W. if u see it all the way<br />        up to version 1.5 then that is where it was introduced (even though<br />        back then it might have been doing a different role)</p>
<p>        Even though the difference between human and chimp is just 1.5%,<br />  thats<br />        1.5% of 3.2 billion and all that difference is not concentrated<br />  at one<br />        place. Also these changes did not happen overnight it has taken<br />        millions of years to make them better survive in their environment.</p>
<p>        In most cases the genes across species (from mouse to man) are<br />  pretty<br />        much the same, u can technically replace one with the other and<br />  won't<br />        see any difference in them. Its primarily the regulation (when and<br />        where and how they are used) makes all the difference.</p>
<p>        think of it like 2 people cooking with the same set of ingredients,<br />        the out come can be very different depending upon when what and how<br />        much of any given component is used.</p>
<p>        hope this helps</p>

        <p>Great to see another computational biologist in this forum. Hi Dr.<br />Arun. :) </p>
<p>Yes you are right that there are three different migrations out of<br />Africa traced out on the basis of mitochondrial DNA. The common thing<br />that the three different routes have is that all the three have same<br />root in Africa. So no one is counter arguing the point that we came<br />from Africa.</p>
<p>But in your whole argument, you say that any gene can be a marker. I<br />think you are not taking a major point into consideration. In Y<br />chromosome, majority of the genes taking part in recombination is very<br />very less almost nil. In other words, the gene in Y wouldnt have<br />changed so much from the ancestor say 80,000 yrs ago. So, it is quite<br />easier to see from where the gene has traveled. In other words, using<br />any gene from my Y chromosome, I can trace back my ancestors. A Human<br />Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup is a haplogroup defined by differences in<br />the non-recombining portions of DNA from the Y chromosome (called Y-DNA).</p>
<p>Now the other chromosomal genes undergo more recombination events from<br />both maternal and paternal side. Hence, I cant really say where the<br />gene came from after few ancestoral generations...It gets more<br />complicated and fuzzy. <br />Also, here no one is trying to pinpoint one person in Africa as the<br />ancestor..they are trying to pinpoint say a group of people/community<br />from where say one guy was a rebel and he took his family for greener<br />pastures :) </p>
<p>Choice of a gene for tracing the root is subjective, I agree as there<br />are more than one gene that can be studied in Y. At the same time,<br />selection of chromosome is not subjective. Say Y chromosome or<br />mitochondrial DNA. Thats why people are studying those two DNA<br />population...</p>
<p>One thing I would say is M130 is not the only haplotype or marker..<br />(this is being hyped by the media) there are others as well. The<br />common thing is it is from Y or mitochondrial DNA and not from other<br />chromosomes. </p>
<p>As said before, other genes cannot answer the question "Where we<br />originated from?" Adding to that, one is trying to answer the question<br />from Y chromosome/mtDNA "If from single ancestor, how did we travel to<br />other parts of the world?".....</p>
<p>I hope this clears lot of things....</p>

<p>    Hello everyone,</p>
<p>    This is a very interesting thread and thanks for all the information<br />    and links! Another recent work on DNA and history was when<br />    archeologists in Lebanon found an ancient Phoenician site with DNA<br />    material. They were able to analyze the DNA and find that people in<br />    Lebanon, Malta and Syria shared this DNA (irrespective of their<br />    religion). This was actually also practically useful as it helped<br />    dispel some politically motivated myths about<br />    who (Lebanese Muslims or Christians) were the true descendants of the<br />    Phoenicians.</p>

<p>      In most cases the genes across species (from mouse to man) are<br />pretty<br />      much the same, u can technically replace one with the other and<br />won't<br />      see any difference in them.

        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>This is a very interesting thread and thanks for all the information<br />and links! Another recent work on DNA and history was when<br />archeologists in Lebanon found an ancient Phoenician site with DNA<br />material. They were able to analyze the DNA and find that people in<br />Lebanon, Malta and Syria shared this DNA (irrespective of their<br />religion). This was actually also practically useful as it helped<br />dispel some politically motivated myths about <br />who (Lebanese Muslims or Christians) were the true descendants of the<br />Phoenicians.</p>

        <p>I am too not able to understand the intricacies of the genetic engineering,but am able to <br />get the outline.</p>
<p>Is there a definite proof that all these people with the marker gene trace their migration to <br />africa? why cant it be other way round? Probably the marker gene in africa got actually <br />migrated from other part of the world, even Tamil nadu, who knows and who can prove <br />that?<br />All theories...nothing can be proved...</p>

        <p>Hi rahul</p>
<p>you are one of our experts too.<br />i still recall your mail on how building a pyramidal structure was <br />the easiest.</p>
<p>I guess to understand what these bio technologists are talking about <br />you need to know the issue.<br />the simple issues is a guy near madurai( go get his autograph) has a <br />gene that is called a marker which is common to all descendants of <br />the original migrants from africa 70,000 years</p>
<p>so we are being explained the nature of this marker gene and whether <br />this system is fool proof.<br />purinchuthaa???/</p>

        <p>Dear Venketesh,</p>
<p>It just happens to be what we work on .. so no big deal in knowing something<br />in that. What you guys know in the field of history and everything else is<br />amazing... The reason for my long silence is mainly because I realized I<br />would learn more stuff from you all that way :)</p>

<p>    Hi Venketesh,<br />    Certain genes can be traced to certain populations. A common <br />example<br />  is the<br />    gene for *haeomophilia* that affects males<br />    in the British and related Royal families. This can act as a <br />marker gene<br />    since it is inherited as part of mitochondrial DNA and that an <br />only be<br />    inherited from the mother. Hence, in this case, that particular <br />gene<br />  can be<br />    used as a marker for that family and for that particular <br />condition.</p>
<p>    However, every gene has its own history. In a sense, we (all <br />living<br />  things)<br />    are vessels for genes to propogate. Those genes that are present <br />in<br />  us are<br />    the successful genes that have beaten out the competition. It is <br />not<br />    necessary that all genes have the same history.. in fact they most<br />  probably<br />    don't and have different ancestors. Hence, this whole notion of an<br />  ancestral<br />    eve is wrong. There are probably as many ancestral genes as there<br />  are genes<br />    in our genome (about 30000-40000 for humans). Hence for one <br />particular<br />    mitochondrial gene, yes, there could be an ancestral eve 70,000<br />  years ago.<br />    But it is a tree structure. If you go back even further, that<br />  ancestral eve<br />    will have her own ancestral eve and so on. And remember, this is <br />for<br />  just<br />    one particular gene. We could build such individual ancestral <br />trees<br />  for all<br />    genes.</p>
<p>    I hope I have been clear. If not, the fault is all mine :) And <br />maybe<br />  I can<br />    try to explain it better another time!</p>

        <p>I think the argument is kind of misleading. I agree that there are<br />30000 to 40000 genes in humans. M130 is a gene present in Y<br />chromosome. Y chromosome is the chromosome passed to the next male<br />generation. The main assumption is there was a single ancestor from<br />whom the whole human population have migrated to different parts of<br />the world. The other marker that is derived from maternal side is the<br />mitochondrial DNA. Hemophilia is also a marker, but it is not enough<br />to answer the question "Where did we originate from?" The answer lies<br />in Y chromosome haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA. <br />Pitchiappan sir's group in Madurai Kamaraj University, have identified<br />the nearest M130 haplogroup in a population that havent got much<br />diversified.</p>
<p>I think the following link explains beautifully how the genetic<br />marker, and why we need to trace our roots back.</p>

        <p>Hi Venketesh,<br />Certain genes can be traced to certain populations. A common example is the<br />gene for *haeomophilia* that affects males<br />in the British and related Royal families. This can act as a marker gene<br />since it is inherited as part of mitochondrial DNA and that an only be<br />inherited from the mother. Hence, in this case, that particular gene can be<br />used as a marker for that family and for that particular condition.</p>
<p>However, every gene has its own history. In a sense, we (all living things)<br />are vessels for genes to propogate. Those genes that are present in us are<br />the successful genes that have beaten out the competition. It is not<br />necessary that all genes have the same history.. in fact they most probably<br />don't and have different ancestors. Hence, this whole notion of an ancestral<br />eve is wrong. There are probably as many ancestral genes as there are genes<br />in our genome (about 30000-40000 for humans). Hence for one particular<br />mitochondrial gene, yes, there could be an ancestral eve 70,000 years ago.<br />But it is a tree structure. If you go back even further, that ancestral eve<br />will have her own ancestral eve and so on. And remember, this is for just<br />one particular gene. We could build such individual ancestral trees for all<br />genes.</p>
<p>I hope I have been clear. If not, the fault is all mine :) And maybe I can<br />try to explain it better another time!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>    Yes. I agree with Arun. Genetics though much hyped about is not the<br />    final one to decide. As Arun said, the gene difference between human<br />    and chimp is only 250. SO if we replace those 250 genes in chip,<br />  will<br />    it become a human? In theory yes, but in practice?</p>
<p>    Recently I read Michale Crichton's ' 'Next'.. amazing novel about<br />  the<br />    good/bad effects of Genetics. Though scientist claim there is a gene<br />    for everything, it doenst make sense. Then if we implant the gene<br />    which suppresses bad thoughts then the whole world becomes a<br />  peaceful<br />    place, which is not at all possible.</p>
<p>    How can they say that the marker gene originated in Africa 700000<br />    years ago. Even if could have originated in gummudipoondi 5000 years<br />    ago. Its all theories.</p>

        <p>On the same topic from today's sify:</p>
<p>Sify News desk<br />Friday, 04 April , 2008, 19:23<br />Last Updated: Friday, 04 April , 2008, 19:25 Chennai: Come April 16 and<br />Discovery Channel is ready to treat viewers to `the Story of<br />India' an epic journey into the world's most ancient surviving<br />civilisation. The new six-part series has been conceived as a<br />chronological history of India, one that will reveal the wonders of<br />India, the diversity and richness of its people, cultures and landscapes<br />and its intense past.</p>
<p>The programme will also focus on a 30-year old systems administrator<br />hailing from a small Tamil Nadu village who has been identified as one<br />of the direct descendants of the first ever settlers in India. The DNA<br />of Virumandi Andithevar matched the white chromosome marker<br />`M130' which incidentally is found only amongst the descendants<br />of African migrants who had spread across the world long ago.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in Chennai on Friday, Deepak Shourie, executive<br />vice-president and managing director, Discovery Networks India, said the<br />series would showcase the intense journey of a nation which has over the<br />centuries regenerated itself several times.</p>
<p>It would focus on the present and past even as it seeks clues to<br />India's past and future. The series would bring to the fore<br />fascinating facts like the first Indians who had walked out of Africa<br />some 70,000 years ago, as well as the discovery of the first<br />Indians' DNA in Tamil Nadu, he said.</p>
<p>A preview of the film, narrated by the eminent historian Michael Wood ,<br />showed some brilliantly photographed sights and sounds of the country.</p>
<p>As the world's most ancient surviving civilisation, India has been<br />at the centre of world history. So how did this vast land come into<br />being? Who were its first inhabitants? Can they be traced? These are<br />some of the questions which `The Story of India' shall attempt<br />to answer, every Wednesday at 8:00 pm, come April 16.</p>

        <p>I know Venketesh, but what I mean is that every gene has its own history<br />through the ages.. .thinking of any one particular gene as a marker gene is<br />really not quite right. Read Richard Dawkins "The Selfish Gene"<br />and other books.. It is well worth a read.</p>
