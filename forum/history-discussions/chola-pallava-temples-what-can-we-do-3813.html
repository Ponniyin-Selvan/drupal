</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi members,<br />This is Chandra (plasticschandra) writing. Althogh there are many <br />good things happening in this forum, I wonder what are we doing <br />in rebuilding the lost beauty- the temples of those great rulers? <br />One after the other, we get daily names and names of temples <br />which cry for attention.</p>
<p>You might be aware, that Dr.T.Satyamurthy, also a new member <br />of our forum, had started the REACH foundation (Rural Education <br />And Conservation of Heritage) recently and we have the trust now.</p>
<p>There are few great landmark temples which we immediately need <br />to reconstruct:-</p>
<p>1. Manimangalam (near tambaram) is one. There are3 temples, of <br />Pallavadynasty which were later retouched by Cholas too, which <br />have some intricate carvings and land mark stone sciptures.</p>
<p>See links:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/02/stories/2006090208830100.htm" title="http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/02/stories/2006090208830100.htm">http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/02/stories/2006090208830100.htm</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/12/31/stories/2003123107210400.htm" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/12/31/stories/2003123107210400.htm">http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/12/31/stories/2003123107210400.htm</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/" title="http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/">http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/</a><br />manimangalam.html</p>
<p>Many of our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  members are also members of yahoo group :</p>
<p>temple_cleaners (which has been registered as REACH - under <br />the guidance of Dr.T.S). the story in the first link appeared in <br />THE HINDU last Saturday. As myself and other REACH members <br />were tied up with some other work, member Ram Sunder @Chandru<br />took the initiative of visiting the place, documenting the photos, <br />details,legends and visiting local people to gain support to work <br />along with REACH for Uzhavaarappani and further reconstrucion <br />work! We estimate a figure of around 20 lakhs.</p>
<p>2. Uthiramerur (nr Kanchi) which also has one of the best and <br />stylisshly bult Kailasanathar temple which may ask for another 25 <br />lakhs.<br />The links:<br />This one says it all about Uthiramerur,<br /><a href="http://prabhukrish.net/category/temples/" title="http://prabhukrish.net/category/temples/">http://prabhukrish.net/category/temples/</a><br /><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081508670500.htm" title="http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081508670500.htm">http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081508670500.htm</a></p>
<p>The money is required to rebuild the way the temples were built <br />those days (using same material and technology, so that they <br />would stand against time for next 1000 years) under the guidance <br />of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  friends.</p>
<p>I wonder what are we doing. Ok, dont come to a fight that we <br />are discussing literature, I also read them with interest. But can't <br />we sustain our energies to atleast do our might to construct <br />those temples, so that <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  name can be etched in Kalvettus as <br />contributors for renovation of these temples?</acronym></p>
<p>This is just tip of the ice-berg.</p>
<p>Another twist is - Member SB@ SPS is also the founder member <br />of REACH!!!</p>
<p>Members,pls suggest ways to improve the Capital and funds we <br />require BADLY, I beg, Badly for renovating these temples. We will <br />account for each penny sent, spent and REACH under Dr.T.S <br />would take responsibility of rebuilding those temples as per all <br />agama sastras and vithi.</p>

        <p>To comeup with the list of such dilapidated temples, the quick step is<br />to watch Jaya TV news every morning at 9.00 AM.</p>
<p>In the "Kalachuvadugal" section, they describe about one such crying<br />temple everyday. They cover from every corner of TamilNadu. </p>

          Chola &amp; Pallava temples - what can we do?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Sriraman</p>
<p>some years ago a group of religiously minded friends searched for and <br />found a dilapitated temple near senji</p>
<p>our primary interest was a antastic thirupukal on it by arunagiri</p>
<p>the temple was called thevanur.</p>
<p>" thevar yaravarum paarin miithu vanthiranji<br />thevanur vilanga vantha perumaanee'</p>
<p>then we put up an organisation with some big shots as members and had <br />a good pledging of funds to repair the temple where there was no idol <br />even.</p>
<p>but then it got stuck up in <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym . and we learnt not only us but some <br />previously had tried it too.<br />I remember a letter to and from Jagmohan who was then minister in the <br />correspondence file.but nothing happened . and we all went bck to our <br />work.</acronym></p>
<p>for those who are interested this temple is a few km from a very <br />famous temple called malayanur( I think?) on a road branching out from <br />senji,<br />those who have a thirupukal book please read this fanstastic verses.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  in the album i have added the photos of a late chola apsidal temple <br />- so<br />  many of them are in Tondaimandalam. the temple is at Sorpanacheri (<br />?)<br />  between Padappai and Walajabad, just 100m from the road. It belongs <br />to<br />  Vikrama Chola period (inf from Dr.TS / Rajavelu. and another on the<br />  near Palaya sivaram on Kpuram-Chengai road. a saptamatrika temple <br />with<br />  pallava period matrikas.</p>
<p>  it seeems that Dr TS took some initiative by advising the locals to <br />do<br />  something. thye promptly provided a asbestos roof over the linga.</p>
<p>  if a restoration is attempted the temple can be completed in full as <br />all<br />  the stone members are available in situ.</p>
<p>  but how?</p>
<p>  the Dharmasthala trust by Vereendra Hegade in Karnataka is running a<br />  organisation which is renovating dilapidated temples intially on 50/<br />50<br />  financing pattern, they did the work as per the norms laid out by <br />asi<br />  with the help of many retired asi officers chipping in with <br />voluntary<br />  service.Dharmasthala trust took care of their travel/hospitality.</p>
<p>  the programme was so dedicated that their work became extremely <br />popular,<br />  the karnataka govt now sharing the 40/50 ofpublic portion.</p>
<p>  so much so that the quality of restoration is so good that they are<br />  being askled by the government to repair the "protected temple<br />  monumnets".</p>
<p>  their simple work can be seen at <a href="http://www.sdmdharmothanatrust.org" title="www.sdmdharmothanatrust.org">www.sdmdharmothanatrust.org</a><br />  <http://www.sdmdharmothanatrust.org  . it gives a very simple <br />account.<br />  but having seen and interacted with the organisers and advisors, <br />their<br />  work is hoghly commendable. they must have restormed many ornate <br />hoysala<br />  monumnets without bowing to modern repair practices of adding <br />unatural<br />  things to the old temple.</http://www.sdmdharmothanatrust.org></p>
<p>  how is it possible? SHEAR DEDICATION AND GOOD SUPPLY OF MONEY AND A<br />  LARGE HEART OF VEREENDRA HEGADE, A JAIN BUT MAINTAINING A <br />SIVAKSHETRA.<br />  HE NEVER ASKED WHY ARE YOU CONSERVING THIS OR THAT TEMPLE. IF THE<br />  COMMITTE APPROVES HE SAYS YES.</p>
<p>  IS THIS POSSIBLE IN TAMIL NADU? WE HAVE MANY DONORS. BUT THE PROBLEM<br />  LIES IN THE FACT THEY GENERALLY REPEAT GENERALLY EXPECT<br />  MILAGE/VISIBILITY. SO THEY PREFER A NEW TEMPLE RATHER THAN RESTORING <br />AN<br />  OLD ONE AS PER ORIGINAL. EVEN IF THEY REPAIR AN OLD ONE THEY FORCE <br />TO<br />  ADD MODERN ENTITIES TO THE OLD. IF HALF A DOZEN PERSON COMES OUT <br />WITH<br />  THE CONVICTION OF HEGGADE THEN THE SCENARIO WILL CHANGE DRASTICALLY.</p>
<p>  HOW TO CHANGE THIS MIND SET? COME TO OUR EXPERIENCE. WHEN WE -ASI-<br />  RESTORES A MONUMENT THE TEAM TAKES THE IMMEDIATE PLEASURE OF <br />ACIEVEMENT.<br />  IT IS A SIMPLE PSYCOLOGICAL THING. JUST THE CHILD IN OUR MIND. IF <br />THE<br />  DONORS ARE INCULCATED TO ENJOY THE PLEASURE ACHIEVEING SOMETHING <br />THAT<br />  OTHERS CAN NOT DO, THEY WILL COME FORWARD.</p>
<p>  Secondly, we too must be professional like the active members of the<br />  trust. dedicated and focussed. the money is there. the mind is <br />waiting<br />  to be "brainwashed". approach with dedication and focus. we will<br />  succeed. even if we succeed in one case be happy. try next.</p>

        <p>SPS,</p>
<p>I am doing the small stuff which I can possible find and do, so no need to thank me. I am only trying to build up an initiative and tempo for others to catch on..I am of the opinion to do things and let our actions do the talk.. instead of talking forever.</p>
<p>I was actually thinking in lines of linking ooranis(DHAN project) to REACH(temple restoration &amp; tank restoration).. to temples which are in rural areas.. two mangos in one stone.. what say?</p>

          Chola &amp; Pallava temples - what can we do?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As a small contribution one of my friends in US has committed to small amount of donation towards this activities and he has also agreed to put out a contribution link on his company(he runs his own company) website, to tap into possible donations from his friends &amp; customers.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can tap into other resources &amp; friends through him. </p>
<p>Arul &amp; Others living abroad, </p>
<p>Can we start pledging or committing small amounts and preferably also commit to find or explore avenues for spreading this information around for a continued commitment from the NRI communit?</p>
<p>For starts, we can put out notices through Indian temples in overseas, for requests for contribution. This effort will definitely allow us to act.. IN fact, I had given Plastics Chandran and Madan's blog on temple's revivial for showcasing efforts that are already in that direction.. Madan &amp; Chandra, I hope I have not transgressed any copyright violations.. :) If so, do bear with me.</p>
<p>What say?</p>
<p>One more point is that my friend is already committing himself to a 500USD contribution for the DHAN (Oorani project), which he is hoping to hand over in the month of Nov-Dec, when he is in india. </p>
<p>Regards<br />Nanda</p>

<p>Dear Chandra and Mouli,<br />These same thoughts have been bothering me for a long time. The more i see, how people take care of their monuments in the U.S, the more ashamed i become. I have been thinking about this for a long time and actually have a plan in mind. The reason the temples were taken care of in the olden days was because of contributions not just from the king but from the common man too. While exploring different ideas i stumbled upon DHAN in Madurai that uses internet to get contributions to renovate Ooranis. They use internet to reach people who live abroad and still want to maintain their roots. In our case, anyone who is interested can contribute towards a temple in memory of their loved ones. Can there be any better memorial than a commemorative plaque (future Kalvettus!!) at the temple site. Since we already have a organizational set up in REACH this seems a possibility. Follow the link for more about DHAN project and see how we can adopt it for our purpose. The gentleman who<br />maintains the Goodnewsindia website will probably be interested in our cause and may even post our cause in his website which has a good readership.<br /><a href="http://www.goodnewsindia.com/index.php/Supplement/article/512/P1/" title="http://www.goodnewsindia.com/index.php/Supplement/article/512/P1/">http://www.goodnewsindia.com/index.php/Supplement/article/512/P1/</a> <br />People who live abroad like me can popularize this cause with their friends and people visiting temples near their areas. With 989 members and counting we already have a great network of people in our group. It might seem like a small number but remember when this group was started all we had was 10 or 12 members and we have grown this far. Please let me know if REACH would interested in such a project and the idea could be developed further with participation from eminent brains in this group.</p>

<p>Dear Chandra,</p>
<p>I also second ur thoughts..i have a reason for that..yesterday, i was travelling through vadapalani..and i saw a very old temple(deity-vengirswarar)..but i was pained to see that the walls of the temple were cluttered with film posters and the place surrounding the temple was full of urine. The walls of the temple have lost their paint..i at once wanted to bring this to the attention of our group members asking them for their advice as to what needs to be done, so that we put a stop to this kind of defiling of the sanctity of our temples..im surprised to find only that our temples are defiled..not even a single mosque or church meets this fate..why is this? I also feel that it is the hindus themselves who do this atrocity..centuries back, people kept the temples clean out of mainly fear of invoking the wrath of god..but now people have lost that fear..<br />also i would like to mention that in the thiagaraja temple in Tiruvarur(my native), there is a well called mookuthi kinaru..supposedly kamalambika's nose stud is inside this well..but if one looks inside that well, you will be in for a shock..lots of slippers,plastic covers..what not..i felt ashamed of myself of being a hapless, apathetic creature..but i want to change this..for this i am ready to donate whatever i can..lets start with a small dot and try to make a big beautiful kolam out of that..

<p>Many of our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  members are also members of yahoo group :</p>
<p>temple_cleaners (which has been registered as REACH - under <br />the guidance of Dr.T.S). the story in the first link appeared in <br />THE HINDU last Saturday. As myself and other REACH members <br />were tied up with some other work, member Ram Sunder @Chandru<br />took the initiative of visiting the place, documenting the photos, <br />details,legends and visiting local people to gain support to work <br />along with REACH for Uzhavaarappani and further reconstrucion <br />work! We estimate a figure of around 20 lakhs.</p>
<p>2. Uthiramerur (nr Kanchi) which also has one of the best and <br />stylisshly bult Kailasanathar temple which may ask for another 25 <br />lakhs.<br />The links:<br />This one says it all about Uthiramerur,<br /><a href="http://prabhukrish.net/category/temples/" title="http://prabhukrish.net/category/temples/">http://prabhukrish.net/category/temples/</a><br /><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081508670500.htm" title="http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081508670500.htm">http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081508670500.htm</a></p>
<p>The money is required to rebuild the way the temples were built <br />those days (using same material and technology, so that they <br />would stand against time for next 1000 years) under the guidance <br />of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  friends.</p>
<p>I wonder what are we doing. Ok, dont come to a fight that we <br />are discussing literature, I also read them with interest. But can't <br />we sustain our energies to atleast do our might to construct <br />those temples, so that <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  name can be etched in Kalvettus as <br />contributors for renovation of these temples?</acronym></p>
<p>This is just tip of the ice-berg.</p>
<p>Another twist is - Member SB@ SPS is also the founder member <br />of REACH!!!</p>
<p>Members,pls suggest ways to improve the Capital and funds we <br />require BADLY, I beg, Badly for renovating these temples. We will <br />account for each penny sent, spent and REACH under Dr.T.S <br />would take responsibility of rebuilding those temples as per all <br />agama sastras and vithi.</p>

          Chola &amp; Pallava temples - what can we do?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Chandra,</p>
<p>I also second ur thoughts..i have a reason for that..yesterday, i was travelling through vadapalani..and i saw a very old temple(deity-vengirswarar)..but i was pained to see that the walls of the temple were cluttered with film posters and the place surrounding the temple was full of urine. The walls of the temple have lost their paint..i at once wanted to bring this to the attention of our group members asking them for their advice as to what needs to be done, so that we put a stop to this kind of defiling of the sanctity of our temples..im surprised to find only that our temples are defiled..not even a single mosque or church meets this fate..why is this? I also feel that it is the hindus themselves who do this atrocity..centuries back, people kept the temples clean out of mainly fear of invoking the wrath of god..but now people have lost that fear..<br />also i would like to mention that in the thiagaraja temple in Tiruvarur(my native), there is a well called mookuthi kinaru..supposedly kamalambika's nose stud is inside this well..but if one looks inside that well, you will be in for a shock..lots of slippers,plastic covers..what not..i felt ashamed of myself of being a hapless, apathetic creature..but i want to change this..for this i am ready to donate whatever i can..lets start with a small dot and try to make a big beautiful kolam out of that.. Ungal ethirpaarpu veen pogathu chandra..</p>

<p>There are few great landmark temples which we immediately need <br />to reconstruct:-</p>
<p>1. Manimangalam (near tambaram) is one. There are3 temples, of <br />Pallavadynasty which were later retouched by Cholas too, which <br />have some intricate carvings and land mark stone sciptures.</p>

<p>Many of our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  members are also members of yahoo group :</p>
<p>temple_cleaners (which has been registered as REACH - under <br />the guidance of Dr.T.S). the story in the first link appeared in <br />THE HINDU last Saturday. As myself and other REACH members <br />were tied up with some other work, member Ram Sunder @Chandru<br />took the initiative of visiting the place, documenting the photos, <br />details,legends and visiting local people to gain support to work <br />along with REACH for Uzhavaarappani and further reconstrucion <br />work! We estimate a figure of around 20 lakhs.</p>
<p>2. Uthiramerur (nr Kanchi) which also has one of the best and <br />stylisshly bult Kailasanathar temple which may ask for another 25 <br />lakhs.<br />The links:<br />This one says it all about Uthiramerur,<br /><a href="http://prabhukrish.net/category/temples/" title="http://prabhukrish.net/category/temples/">http://prabhukrish.net/category/temples/</a><br /><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081508670500.htm" title="http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081508670500.htm">http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/15/stories/2004081508670500.htm</a></p>
<p>The money is required to rebuild the way the temples were built <br />those days (using same material and technology, so that they <br />would stand against time for next 1000 years) under the guidance <br />of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  friends.</p>
<p>I wonder what are we doing. Ok, dont come to a fight that we <br />are discussing literature, I also read them with interest. But can't <br />we sustain our energies to atleast do our might to construct <br />those temples, so that <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  name can be etched in Kalvettus as <br />contributors for renovation of these temples?</acronym></p>
<p>This is just tip of the ice-berg.</p>
<p>Another twist is - Member SB@ SPS is also the founder member <br />of REACH!!!</p>
<p>Members,pls suggest ways to improve the Capital and funds we <br />require BADLY, I beg, Badly for renovating these temples. We will <br />account for each penny sent, spent and REACH under Dr.T.S <br />would take responsibility of rebuilding those temples as per all <br />agama sastras and vithi.</p>
