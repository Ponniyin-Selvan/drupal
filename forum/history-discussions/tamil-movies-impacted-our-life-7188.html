</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>We have had discussion on books and songs before..was wondering if we couldtalk on movies that have impacted people's lives somehow. If possible let us not talk of out and out entertainers or fan based movies, just what had some emotional impact at some stage in our life (I still remember Satish's argument on 'what chagned our life' so am not using that phrase:))) My listis as below...</p>
<p>1 Avvaiyaar - This movie inspired my interest in tamil and tamil literature, i watched it at age 6 or so with my grandmother and she explained most ofsongs/lyrics. At age 8 or 9 when most students went for Hindi as second language I opted for Tamil and this movie was inspiring in that regard. Although most of the movie appears to be fiction (ascertained via Thiru Vairam!)it is still very inspiring for KBS's performance as Avvai and some glimpses into Sangam period.</p>
<p>2 Unnaal Mudiyum Thambi - KB Masterpiece with great performances by Kamal/Manorama and all. Don't think there is any need to say more.</p>
<p>3 Sumaithaangi - somewhat less known flop movie by Sridhar with off beat story, great performances by Muthuraman/Gemini. Very memorable for KD songs particularly the inspiring Mayakkama..Kalakkama which is on top of KD songs for most people.</p>
<p>4 Paavamannippu - religious integration and great music again. I watched this movie with my best friend who was a muslim while in 7th or 8th grade andit made us even closer. </p>
<p>5 Paasamalar/Lavakusa - emotional outlets, am ranking both these movies together as both are tearjerkers, but if you live 6000 miles from home you will realize how much you need them! Pasamalar everyone knows enough although I regard the story as completely unrealistic it is very watchable for many reasons other than that. Lavakusa, outstanding music and the best portrayalof Uttar Kanada on movie screen.</p>
<p>Waiting to hear from all!!</p>

        <p>Dear Venkatesh Sir,</p>
<p>It is all because of the best dialogues by Crazy Mohan.... Kamal + Crazy Mohan team has always been too good and tons of good comedy!</p>
<p>Rgds.,</p>
<p>Shiv</p>

<p>Anbe Sivam:- I would?vote this as my MOST FAVOURITE of all times.?Excellent?portrayal by Kamal and Madhavan.?I was going to write about this while I?saw this message from Venkateswaran Sir. A great movie! </p>
<p>The other movies that impressed me was </p>
<p>1. Shashawnk Redemption: A jailed convict how he manages to escape. May look simple but one?need to see this. <br />2. The?Sixth Sense: No explanation needed.<br />3.?Unnal Mudiyum Thambi<br />4. Samsaaram adhu Minsaaram:- Though Cinematic in many scenes, many day to day joint family issues have been analysed beautifully.</p>
<p>When it comes to comedy: I would put 1) Michael Madhana Kama Rajan and 2) Vasool Raja MBBS?on top?of my?list. I was?watching Vasool Raja on Sun TV last Sunday and believe every joke seemed to be new and more and more new jokes were discovered. Example: The scene in which the friend (a girl) of Sneha tells Kamal " pOnga mappiLLai, mounam sammadhamdhaan" . Kamal willthink weirdly for a second and will say " sa..ri...... . macchi...... ..".?I just could not control the laughter there.<br />?<br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>UMT had so many moments that were Balachander at his best.including humor..like Gemini says 'Nalla maatukku oru soodu da' and Kamal goes 'mattukku thaane appa :) Then Kamal's facial expression when Sita says her name is K Malam (Kamalam). And the moment in the car when Gemini refuses to stop for a worker dying of injury. My only regret is the ending which is too dramatic, could have been made little subtle but ok.</p>
<p>Thanneer Thaneer was very good movie too but credit for that goes to the original play by Komal Swaminathan.</p>

<p>    UNNAL MUDIYUM THAMBI - impressed me so much ... (they touched too many things in the same movie :: Child labour - Green revolution - apathy to caste system etc.).. </p>

        <p>RAvi, i like your list :)) No serious debate but just some viewpoints..Dev Anand, Sivakumar, Gemini all ok , but RAjini? Am not debating acting skillsor complexion but how did RAjini get on handsome men list? Kamal also ok but lot of asadu vazhiyal/beku type of looks in early years. Same with Dharmendar. Am always surprised folks calling him handsome. Oru urulai kizhangukku features ezhudina kooda konjam nalla irukkum. And none of them maintained any real body shape btw, for that we have to give credit to MGR and perhaps Rajini too. Telugu guys maintained excellent figure, most of them. Of course most tamils are not exposed their neighbor. BTW have you seen NTR in early social roles? He can all of these guys a run for their money combined.</p>
<p>Regading heroines list ok, but REka/Sridevi lot of make up. By late 70s lotof make up took over genuine look looks. Sridevi had very good figure though. Why they dont' maintain figure, well perhaps one has to realize a woman's body goes through more changes than a man and the general public atleastin those days wanted their women idli like not slim like Waheeda Rehman. KRV and Savitri in later years could fill a 70 mm screen but still were hitsso..audience choice?</p>
<p>Again no serious debate. Saturday morning, lot of work to do and sombala startukkku just lookign for something to wake up.</p>

<p>-hi Vairam,<br />? The dialogue of Vedham puthithu is like evergreen punch dialogue.In most of the Bhagyaraj films also had such type sensitive messages like "naalu pathni perai sollunga" I think you know the full dialogues.Its really a wonderful scene but i dont know the name of the film. </p>

<p>  Speaking on Widow remarriage (already discussed movie ratha kanner) I would like to mention one of Barathiraja's lesser known movies ' pasumpon' . Ireally loved the movie. Prabhu goes away from his mother after her mother gets remarried and gets baby out of that marriage. Very sensitive subject and brilliantly handled one.</p>
<p>  I dont know how I missed Vedham Puthitu!!!!!<br />  One dialogues still in my heart 'balu kirathu unga peru ...devar rathu neega vanguna patama?'... na karai eriten neenga innum kara eralaye!'<br />  One of the most sensitive movies in Tamil.</p>

<p>    I used to watch many movies before but now not htat much! The movies which are my favourite are:<br />    ?<br />    Punnagai: I agree with Vairam sir! The different smiles of each person......! I can't forget the scene where Jayanthi smiles when she?could have?been suspected by her hub. <br />    ?<br />    Nenjam marapadhillai: A story of rebirth. The songs and especially the humming by Mrs.P.Suseela in the title song takes us into the story.<br />    ?<br />    Lage chunari mein daang: A Rani Mukerjee starrer film in Hindi. Rani isforced to go astray because of her family situation.

Can anyone forget those dialogues?<br />    ?<br />    Ratha kanneer: Mr.M.R.Radha's casual act and strong screenplay. After he becomes blind till the end the story is full of sorrow but the dialogues still being casual is the great wonder in the movie!<br />    ?</p>

<p>    We have had discussion on books and songs before..was wondering if we could talk on movies that have impacted people's lives somehow. If possible let us not talk of out and out entertainers or fan based movies, just what had some emotional impact at some stage in our life (I still remember Satish's argument on 'what chagned our life' so am not using that phrase:))) My list is as below...</p>
<p>    1 Avvaiyaar - This movie inspired my interest in tamil and tamil literature, i watched it at age 6 or so with my grandmother and she explained most of songs/lyrics. At age 8 or 9 when most students went for Hindi as second language I opted for Tamil and this movie was inspiring in that regard. Although most of the movie appears to be fiction (ascertained via Thiru Vairam!) it is still very inspiring for KBS's performance as Avvai and some glimpses into Sangam period.</p>
<p>    2 Unnaal Mudiyum Thambi - KB Masterpiece with great performances by Kamal/Manorama and all. Don't think there is any need to say more.</p>
<p>    3 Sumaithaangi - somewhat less known flop movie by Sridhar with off beat story, great performances by Muthuraman/Gemini. Very memorable for KD songs particularly the inspiring Mayakkama..Kalakkama which is on top of KD songs for most people.</p>
<p>    4 Paavamannippu - religious integration and great music again. I watched this movie with my best friend who was a muslim while in 7th or 8th gradeand it made us even closer. </p>
<p>    5 Paasamalar/Lavakusa - emotional outlets, am ranking both these moviestogether as both are tearjerkers, but if you live 6000 miles from home youwill realize how much you need them! Pasamalar everyone knows enough although I regard the story as completely unrealistic it is very watchable for many reasons other than that. Lavakusa, outstanding music and the best portrayal of Uttar Kanada on movie screen.</p>
<p>    Waiting to hear from all!!</p>

<p>I didn't like Breakfast at Tiffany's so much don't remember why saw it a long time ago. Yes Audrey Hepburn was a lovely woman - Sabrina, Funny face, How to Steal a Million, Wait until dark..the list is long and each one of them a classic although Roman Holiday and My fair lady are her bests in my opinion.And if anyone gets to see a documentary she made 'Gardens of the world', if you are a plant and garden enthusiast it is a visual treat. She has a rose and a tulip named after her by the way.</p>

<p>      Dear Kathie, perhaps i must watch PP again and observe the <br />      'moments' you mentioned... i watched a very long time ago and as <br />      Vairam said it did not have much appeal.</p>
<p>      I share your other list, absolutely love How Green was my valley, <br />      Kill a Mockingbird and Rebecca..gosh if there ever was a classic, <br />      and Olivier is sooooo handsome and romantic, isn't he?</p>
<p>      I love musicals perhaps being used to indian movies with so many <br />      song situations. My Fair Lady is my eternal favorite, I can watch <br />      Sound of Music still but has gotten a little stale due to so many <br />      watchings. South Pacific is awesome too. BTW being a romantic how <br />      did you miss Roman Holiday?</p>

<p>        Dear Malathi,<br />        I'll tell you why. I'm always looking for that 'epiphany' <br />      moment : when<br />        something is so moving yet understated it just overwhelms you<br />        emotionally. P. P. has two moments like that for me, maybe 2 1/2 --<br />        First when the auntie, after she's been driven away, is found not <br />      far<br />        from the home, dead w ants [that's the 1/2].<br />        But the biggies are these :when father finally returns from Kasi <br />      with<br />        saris for wife and dtr. Ravi Shankar's sitar keens, and finally, for<br />        the<br />        1st time, mother weeps for her dead Durga.<br />        2nd biggy is --as the family is leaving for good, for Kasi, Apu is<br />        examining the wall and finds the pathetic little bead bracelet that<br />        Durga had denied stealing, where she'd hidden it. It makes me nearly<br />        tear up just thinking about it -- and Apu throws it into the pond.<br />        I can't think of many films that have moved me as much as that one<br />        did.<br />        Other favorites are A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Rebecca,<br />        How Green was my Valley, also To Kill a Mockingbird :<br />        [when Scout says, Hey, Boo] You can see I'm a total romantic.<br />        Kathie<br />        On Mar 24, 2009, at 6:07 PM, dmaloo wrote:</p>
<p>          Dear Kathy, looks like we are having a mixed discussion so do come<br />          up with your favorites as well. As for Ray and Pather Panchali you<br />          get the Nobel prize for patience from me for watching and<br />          appreciating. No offence at all but I have tried that is all.</p>
<p>          Perhaps if you are used to life in India certain things do not <br />      have<br />          the same kind of appeal...</p>

        <p>Ah..Kathie..am hoping noone here is going to object to the amount of movie related conversation going on. I can give you my choices though - in my opinion - Padmini, Vyjayanthimala, Sarojadevi, Madhubala, Waheeda Rehman were among the best looking. The last two are purely hindi actresses -Padmini and Sarojadevi put on weight towards their latter years also given the fact that being idli like was south indian standard in those days for women but up north most heroines maintained their figure. Madhubala also featured on Time's most beautiful women of the century although ranked much lower than she deserved.</p>
<p>As far as heroes go I think we talked about NTR. NTR also figured on Time magazines most handsome men of the century I think he ranked like 10th or so. Again only see him in his early years towards latter years quite unbearable. Some other good looking men were Muthuraman in tamil who also maintained very good figure(his son Karthik also was very good looking for a while),Ravi chandran also tamil. Lots of telugu men have great stature as well asgood looks especially the older lot - there was a guy named Ramakrishna who played Arjuna and was very good looking, some others include Gummadi, Krishna and Sobhan Babu, all very good looking men. I don't equate skin color towards good looks so most northern men disqualify :))</p>
<p>Will send you links when i find some time.</p>

<p>        Dear Malathi,<br />        I'll tell you why. I'm always looking for that 'epiphany'  <br />      moment : when<br />        something is so moving yet understated it just overwhelms you<br />        emotionally. P. P. has two moments like that for me, maybe 2 1/2 --<br />        First when the auntie, after she's been driven away, is found not  <br />      far<br />        from the home, dead w ants [that's the 1/2].<br />        But the biggies are these :when father finally returns from Kasi  <br />      with<br />        saris for wife and dtr. Ravi Shankar's sitar keens, and finally, for<br />        the<br />        1st time, mother weeps for her dead Durga.<br />        2nd biggy is --as the family is leaving for good, for Kasi, Apu is<br />        examining the wall and finds the pathetic little bead bracelet that<br />        Durga had denied stealing, where she'd hidden it. It makes me nearly<br />        tear up just thinking about it -- and Apu throws it into the pond.<br />        I can't think of many films that have moved me as much as that one<br />        did.<br />        Other favorites are A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Rebecca,<br />        How Green was my Valley, also To Kill a Mockingbird :<br />        [when Scout says, Hey, Boo] You can see I'm a total romantic.<br />        Kathie<br />        On Mar 24, 2009, at 6:07 PM, dmaloo wrote:</p>
<p>          Dear Kathy, looks like we are having a mixed discussion so do come<br />          up with your favorites as well.

<p>          Perhaps if you are used to life in India certain things do not  <br />      have<br />          the same kind of appeal...</p>

        <p>Hi A<br />?How many of us have seen "The Hurricane" - starring Denzel Washington? This movie is often played on in Zee Studio.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>I disagree, i have seen impact not once but several times. I can relate some stories. There was a girl in my school when we were in 6th grade or 5th. Her father was a constant drunkard and she suffered very unhappy family situation. She was always a good student although not first and very sincere dedicated, after 5th grade her grades started falling rapidly. The teacher and some of us friends discovered that her grandmotehr who was the only caretaker at home had died and now she was only left with the two constantly bickering parents. Despite repeated counselling nothing would help this girl.Until one day the nun found out that she liked music. We had a school showing of Sound of Music a few days later, and she wanted to know the meaning of the song 'Climb Every mountain'. We were not old enough to grasp meanings right away, so the sister used that opportunity to explain the song to her, play it on piano, even taught her to sing. It gave that child<br />some happiness, honestly you could see it on her face. After that every week the nun made it a point to find one song and teach the whole class but specifically to her. Today she is a doctor and doing extremely well.</p>
<p>She recalls Climb Every mountain to this day as the song that saved her from total depression and hopelessness as a child. As you said Udanx yes movies make us feel good. Sometimes people need to feel good to go on with theirlives.</p>
<p>Never under estimate the power of the media. More Americans have been savedfrom suicide by Shawshank Redemption than any suicide hotline, it is a proven fact. Nobody can say in a linear way this movie will have that affect but on the other hand to write off everything as 'feel good nonsense' is well..completely untrue.</p>

<p>  "To Sir with love" the black &amp; White version is too good a movie but what<br />  impact did it make in the society. The only impact to the best of my<br />  knowledge is that we talk even years after its released. That's the impact<br />  you want to talk about.</p>
<p>  Movies don't make an impact. It gives you a feel good feeling. If that's<br />  what you are trying to drive I am with you...</p>

<p>The movie was really slow , typical art house movie. I am not able to appreciate the movie much , though it is brilliant taken. </p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Did any one see The wrestler which released last year? <br />I really loved the movie, esp while I was in school I used to watch Wrestling on TV. The director's(Daren Aronofsky) other movies are also good PI, Fountain, Requiem of a Dream.</p>
<p>Entertainment and Thriller - Christopher Nolan is great - all his movies are simply brilliant - Momento, Prestige, Batman Begins, Dark Knight.</p>
<p>I also like David Fincher's Seven and Fight Club.</p>
<p>Client East wood movies are consistently good - Unforgiven, Mystic river, million dollar baby, gran torino</p>

        <p>I disagree, i have seen impact not once but several times. I can relate some stories. There was a girl in my school when we were in 6th grade or 5th. Her father was a constant drunkard and she suffered very unhappy family situation. She was always a good student although not first and very sincere dedicated, after 5th grade her grades started falling rapidly. The teacher and some of us friends discovered that her grandmotehr who was the only caretaker at home had died and now she was only left with the two constantly bickering parents. Despite repeated counselling nothing would help this girl.Until one day the nun found out that she liked music. We had a school showing of Sound of Music a few days later, and she wanted to know the meaning of the song 'Climb Every mountain'. We were not old enough to grasp meanings right away, so the sister used that opportunity to explain the song to her, play it on piano, even taught her to sing. It gave that child some happiness, honestly you could see it on her face. After that every week the nun made it a point to find one song and teach the whole class but specificallyto her. Today she is a doctor and doing extremely well.</p>
<p>She recalls Climb Every mountain to this day as the song that saved her from total depression and hopelessness as a child. As you said Udanx yes movies make us feel good. Sometimes people need to feel good to go on with theirlives.</p>
<p>Never under estimate the power of the media. More Americans have been savedfrom suicide by Shawshank Redemption than any suicide hotline, it is a proven fact. Nobody can say in a linear way this movie will have that affect but on the other hand to write off everything as 'feel good nonsense' is well..completely untrue.</p>

        <p>Hey Udanx man I started saying something more only after others..ML is not my life changing or even favorite, it is one on list of KB movies that is all. What is the take away , do you remember last hilarious scene of severalkids chasing Kamal with 'appa, appa' :)) Like Vairam said all a movie can do is offer a perspective that you might not have thought of that is all, and most KB movies did live up to that.</p>

<p>  I was hearing a Myskin(Anjathe,Nandalala) interview , he said seeing a MGR movie is just entertainment but when a MGR hits 100 people to save justice, even thought the viewer will never peform this act , he will atleast feel there is some injustice happening we have to do something(wether he acts or not is not our problem). A film can give only that much of an impact, itcan never `change a life of a person'. All a film can do is show a problemand show a solution.</p>
<p>  Similarly the film we say we like has made some impact in us in an unknown way. Some where down the line subconciously it affects our decision making. So I dont prefer to rule out the films I like since, it has made some impact on me but it has not resulted in any useful outcome as of now, some times in my life time it might or it might not!</p>
<p>  Different view, watching a movie when ur idle keeps ur mind occupied and prevents your mind being a devil's workshop. That itself is a biggest impact of a movie!<br />  Regards,<br />  Vairam</p>

<p>          UMT had so many moments that were Balachander at his best.including<br />      humor..like Gemini says 'Nalla maatukku oru soodu da' and Kamal goes<br />      'mattukku thaane appa :) Then Kamal's facial expression when Sita says her<br />      name is K Malam (Kamalam). And the moment in the car when Gemini refuses to<br />      stop for a worker dying of injury. My only regret is the ending whichis too<br />      dramatic, could have been made little subtle but ok.</p>

<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  can't add a thing about Tamil movies - never seen one.<br />&amp; I realize how many of you hate us to get off topic. Sorry.</acronym></p>

        <p>The story is Martin Sheen is given an assingment to kill Brando.

        <p>Vairam,</p>
<p>In Ayudha Yezhuthu Manirathnam wants the youth to take politics seriously.<br />How many of us have done that? I don't want our members to start a Lok<br />Paritran and fail. At least you can vote. You may say I vote ... Then Why is<br />that the average voting is hovering around just 60% for the past 42 years!<br />Even after Ayudha Yezhuthu ...</p>
<p>Another example</p>
<p>"To Sir with love" the black &amp; White version is too good a movie but what<br />impact did it make in the society. The only impact to the best of my<br />knowledge is that we talk even years after its released. That's the impact<br />you want to talk about.</p>
<p>Movies don't make an impact. It gives you a feel good feeling. If that's<br />what you are trying to drive I am with you...</p>

<p>Anbe Sivam:- I would?vote this as my MOST FAVOURITE of all times.?Excellent?portrayal by Kamal and Madhavan.?I was going to write about this while I?saw this message from Venkateswaran Sir. A great movie! <br />?<br />The other movies that impressed me was <br />?<br />1. Shashawnk Redemption: A jailed convict how he manages to escape. May look simple but one?need to see this. <br />2. The?Sixth Sense: No explanation needed.<br />3.?Unnal Mudiyum Thambi<br />4. Samsaaram adhu Minsaaram:- Though Cinematic in many scenes, many day to day joint family issues have been analysed beautifully.<br />?<br />When it comes to comedy: I would put 1) Michael Madhana Kama Rajan and 2) Vasool Raja MBBS?on top?of my?list. I was?watching Vasool Raja on Sun TV last Sunday and believe every joke seemed to be new and more and more new jokes were discovered. Example: The scene in which the friend (a girl) of Sneha tells Kamal " pOnga mappiLLai, mounam sammadhamdhaan" . Kamal willthink weirdly for a second and will say " sa..ri...... . macchi...... ..".?I just could not control the laughter there.<br />?<br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>UMT had so many moments that were Balachander at his best.including humor..like Gemini says 'Nalla maatukku oru soodu da' and Kamal goes 'mattukku thaane appa :) Then Kamal's facial expression when Sita says her name is K Malam (Kamalam). And the moment in the car when Gemini refuses to stop for a worker dying of injury. My only regret is the ending which is too dramatic, could have been made little subtle but ok.</p>
<p>Thanneer Thaneer was very good movie too but credit for that goes to the original play by Komal Swaminathan.</p>

<p>        Very nice movie but not able to remember the name, if any body can give<br />      the name I would be really happy.</p>
<p>        ....<br />        Ratha kaneer is a brilliant movie . Still it can be enjoyed! Literally<br />      Vivek would have lifted each of MRR reaction in so many comedy scenes.</p>
<p>        Oru veedu iruvasal, Achamillai Achamillai are also good movies from<br />      Balachandar.<br />        ....<br />        Like IMDB some on should start Tamil movie list. Esp this generation<br />      needs to see classics of the 60s-70s-80s.</p>

          Tamil Movies that impacted our life        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Where is this thread going? People are listing the movies which they like -<br />If not all many of them.</p>
<p>For example what is the take away from Manmadha Leelai ( I must accept that<br />I love this movie. But is in that movie? How did it impact (Y)our life.<br />Nothing</p>
<p>Similarly 16 Vayadhinile -- No doubt its a watershed movie as far as Tamizh<br />cinema is concerned. But what is the take away</p>
<p>Since it has become more of a list of movies which a person likes my 2 cents<br />as well</p>
<p>1. Anbe Siva -- Adhuthavanukkaga Varutha padra manasu irukke - Adhu thaan<br />Kadavul<br />2. Guna<br />3. 16 Vayadhinile<br />4. Kizhakke Pogum Rayil<br />5. Sigappu Rojakkal<br />6. Niram Maaradha Pookkal<br />7. Pudhiya Vaarpugal<br />8. Bharathi Kannama<br />9. Porkaalam<br />10. Pandavar Bhoomi<br />11. Pandavar Bhumi</p>
<p>The English list is as follows</p>
<p>1. Patton<br />2. Rain Man<br />3. Falling in Love<br />4. Ben Hur<br />5. 10 Commandments<br />6. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest<br />7. Trading PLaces<br />8. To Sir With Love<br />9. Mackenna's Gold<br />10. The Guns of Navarone</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>"Street car named desire" has a classic Brando with his playboyish looks. Vivian Leigh as Brando's Sister-in-law was mesmerizing with her fears and her <br />stories. At one point, I felt probably Brando was the villain as he plays the wife-beater, but in effect he was actually helping her get to reality.</p>
<p>Another Brando War Classic would be Apocalypse Now.</p>

<p>Nayakan - also Kamal hair scratching after he gets old! he would have mimicked Brando in every possible way. Only the black suit was replaced by whiteDhothi Shirt!</p>
<p>Please see Street Car Named desire, there is some brilliant psychology in the two characters. Brando is primarily a wild animal kind of character and a wife beater. Her wife is soft but loves his character. Every time he willhit her. She will run and go to her neighbors(actually floor above to her house). Then Brando will go begging after her and bring her back after sometime. Exactly at this place we will have sandakoli song in our Tamil movie!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Vairam, I regard the Anjali cycling scene as blatant copy, no 'influence'there!! I disliked Ayutha Ezhuthu much for the portrayal of wife beater and did not watch at all so cannot speak to that. Very good to know about Pagal Nilavu and Kanathil...btw I have a mexican friend who might know so I will check with him on the original.</p>
<p>  Nayakan is kind of an odd mix. It is a great movie by indian standards. Without a doubt. Of course it is more than an influence, it is out and out copy of Godfather in many scenes, right from Kamal's gait and pan chewing last days. Let us call it a good adaptation, perhaps.</p>

<p>      BTW I had no idea Anjali's bro/sis were from KAMB. Looking at it yes!! Thank you!! How many subltelies our movie makers copy (although Mani is someone I greatly respect!). I saw a big screen showing of KAMB just after Gregory Peck's passing last year. It was one of the most memorable theatre experiences for me.</p>
<p>    I wouldn't say it a copy , i would term it influence. It can be found in all his movies. Some of the things I have noticed</p>
<p>    1. Auytha Eluthu - Madhavan - Meera Jasmine character - from Street carnamed desire - Marlon brando and I forgot the heroine name.<br />    2. Nayakan - godfather - Killing of Reddy brothers when his wife funeral happen - lift from godfather - killing of the families when he becomes god father of his sister's son<br />    3. Auytha eluthu - Screen play - 3 characters meeting each other - ameros persos- except for the screen play nothing else is same in the movie(ameros peros is about love).<br />    4. Pagal nilavu - the whole story is lift from Marlon Brando's On the waterfront. There were enough changes though. ( the direct remake was Ghulam(aati kya kandhala) in Hindi).<br />    5. Anjali - one song has ET + star wars inspiration.<br />    6. Kannathil Muthamittal some Mexican book. I dont know the name.</p>
<p>    Except for Kannathil Muthamittal all other movies i realised when I sawthe original. </p>
<p>    Interesting tit bit, American Film institute rates Gregory peck's character in TKAMB as the No. 1 Hero in American movie history. Any one who saw the movie would know he has no fiery dialogue or action or even great emotion. But the character itself by its superior virtues stands out.</p>

<p>      Hi Vairam, that was a great list!! I am saving some of your comments for me to watch esp the german movies. I deliberatly did not include english movies in my list, i have a whole dairy full of them and it will overshadow local language discussion, same thing happeend when we discussed books! </p>

<p>        My list - would surely have lot of foriegn language movies!<br />        1. Aval apadithan - Movie on women's liberty a movie well ahead of time, probably ahead of times for people who watch it even today.</p>
<p>        2. Lives of others (german movie) - Movie abt two people being spied by the East german government. The guy who spies the two people get so moved by the life of the two people that he starts to save them from the government. Simple story packed with emotion. Movie which will shake you emotionally. ..simply a brilliant movie.</p>
<p>        3. Schindler's List - another great movie, abt one guy who saves lives of so many jews during second world war. One mans effort to save people, unthinkable act.</p>
<p>        4. Naan kadavul - after seeing the movie I wrote a big blog on the experience of it. More than the movie the part of the beggars really affected me. Its one of the many things we know its bad but still do everything in our power to ignore it.</p>
<p>        5.Iruvar - the love for the movie developed very recently - its a master piece , esp for Mohan lal, Vairamuthu and Maniratham. has two Sangam poems in it + so much of Tamil political history!</p>
<p>        6 Punnagai - One old Balachandar movie where 4 friends take oath tobe truthful in life, but none except for Gemini follow it. Very nice movieit. </p>
<p>        7. Talk to her (Spanish movie) - Movie about a guys love for a gal and to what extent he goes to be in love with her.very emotional movie.</p>
<p>        8. M (german) - A 1931 movie - absolute masterpiece. A story where local dons form a netwrok of beggars to catch a notorious criminal.(Bcos ofthis guy Police are cracking down on all illegal activities , so they decide to nab him - so that they can do their business as usual)</p>
<p>        9.Once - a musical released in 2006. The cast has no major people except for two musicians. There is no story at all, they two meet compose some songs and seprate after a week. But the music is one of the best I have ever heard. Juts for the romantic music all through the movie!</p>
<p>        10. Ragging Bull - a movie abt a boxer who finally became nothing but a loser in life. DeNiro's acting is at the best , but I like Joe Pesci'sacting more. DeNiro won an Oscar for this movie.</p>
<p>        11. Fireman's Ball/Closely watched train (chezch/serbian) both movies for their natural subdued comedy which I have rarely seen in movies. most movies have situation based comedy or slapstick. These movies have a natural comedy through out.</p>
<p>        12. Seven Samurai/Kagemusha/ Run (Japanese) - all movies formt he master akira Kurasowa - Takes you into world of samurai's so authentic, you will be spell bound. He is also great with masala movies( Yojimbo and sanjoro are his samruai versions of cowboy movies - both are amazing).</p>
<p>        13. Apocalyspe now - Very psychotic movie - how a person turns mad by the end of war. A true classic.</p>
<p>        14. Full Metal jacket/ 2001 A space odessy - both movies of StanleyKubrick - should just see for the technical brilliance and attention to details.</p>
<p>        15.To Kill a mocking bird - The movie should be watched by all fathers! The hero, Gregory Peck as father of two kids is awesome. Manirathanam had heavy inspiration from this movie. The kids role in Anjali movie is direct lift from this movie( the tom boy sis and the bro) and also prabhu charcter also has inspiration form the movie...</p>
<p>        If I have to give a list it would go to ten parts .... stopping with this now.</p>

<p>          We have had discussion on books and songs before..was wondering if we could talk on movies that have impacted people's lives somehow. If possible let us not talk of out and out entertainers or fan based movies, justwhat had some emotional impact at some stage in our life (I still rememberSatish's argument on 'what chagned our life' so am not using that phrase:))) My list is as below...</p>
<p>          1 Avvaiyaar - This movie inspired my interest in tamil and tamil literature, i watched it at age 6 or so with my grandmother and she explained most of songs/lyrics. At age 8 or 9 when most students went for Hindi assecond language I opted for Tamil and this movie was inspiring in that regard. Although most of the movie appears to be fiction (ascertained via Thiru Vairam!) it is still very inspiring for KBS's performance as Avvai and some glimpses into Sangam period.</p>
<p>          2 Unnaal Mudiyum Thambi - KB Masterpiece with great performances by Kamal/Manorama and all. Don't think there is any need to say more.</p>
<p>          3 Sumaithaangi - somewhat less known flop movie by Sridhar with off beat story, great performances by Muthuraman/Gemini. Very memorable for KD songs particularly the inspiring Mayakkama..Kalakkam a which is on top of KD songs for most people.</p>
<p>          4 Paavamannippu - religious integration and great music again. I watched this movie with my best friend who was a muslim while in 7th or 8thgrade and it made us even closer. </p>
<p>          5 Paasamalar/Lavakusa - emotional outlets, am ranking both these movies together as both are tearjerkers, but if you live 6000 miles from home you will realize how much you need them! Pasamalar everyone knows enoughalthough I regard the story as completely unrealistic it is very watchablefor many reasons other than that. Lavakusa, outstanding music and the bestportrayal of Uttar Kanada on movie screen.</p>
<p>          Waiting to hear from all!!</p>

        <p>Impressive list of movies.</p>
<p>Schindler's list, As good as it gets, one who flew over the cuckoo's nest are some movies that really moved me.</p>
<p>Manohara keeps a special place in my heart, I remember first listening to the tape when I was in 6th grade , by 7th the tape was totally in my memory.Ever since I was fascinated by Tamil and Cholas until <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  came in my life at 11th grade.</p>
<p>Manohara will be my special light for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Michael Madana kamarajan did teach me on how humor is around every corner and I had failed to recognize it. Now at any time humor is our best friend, MMKR helped me with that concept.</p>

<p>    This is one movie that talks about so many aspects of life from 2 ppls point<br />    of view. One who understands it and has accepted it as a part of life. And<br />    the other, like most of us, have seen such things only on TV and newspaper,<br />    but have never had first hand experiance.<br />    How the 2 ppl react to these is just awesome. We all know about Kamal's<br />    acting prowess. but Madhavan truly stole the show!</p>
<p>    The others would be:<br />    2. Kannathil Mutham Ittal<br />    3. Anand (Hindi movie - Rajesh Kanna and Amithabh)<br />    4. Children of Heaven - A superb movie based in Tehran about 2 young<br />    children,brother and sister. Some of the scenes in the movie were shot using<br />    hidden camera coz they wanted to keep the shooting secret!<br />    5. Iruvar<br />    6. Rang De Basanthi<br />    7.Tare Zameen Par</p>

<p>      Anbe Sivam:- I would vote this as my MOST FAVOURITE of all<br />      times. Excellent portrayal by Kamal and Madhavan. I was going to write about<br />      this while I saw this message from Venkateswaran Sir. A great movie!</p>
<p>      The other movies that impressed me was</p>
<p>      1. Shashawnk Redemption: A jailed convict how he manages to escape. May<br />      look simple but one need to see this.<br />      2. The Sixth Sense: No explanation needed.<br />      3. Unnal Mudiyum Thambi<br />      4. Samsaaram adhu Minsaaram:- Though Cinematic in many scenes, many day to<br />      day joint family issues have been analysed beautifully.</p>
<p>      When it comes to comedy: I would put 1) Michael Madhana Kama Rajan and 2)<br />      Vasool Raja MBBS on top of my list. I was watching Vasool Raja on SunTV<br />      last Sunday and believe every joke seemed to be new and more and morenew<br />      jokes were discovered. Example: The scene in which the friend (a girl) of<br />      Sneha tells Kamal " pOnga mappiLLai, mounam sammadhamdhaan". Kamal will<br />      think weirdly for a second and will say " sa..ri....... macchi........". I<br />      just could not control the laughter there.</p>

<p>      UMT had so many moments that were Balachander at his best.including<br />      humor..like Gemini says 'Nalla maatukku oru soodu da' and Kamal goes<br />      'mattukku thaane appa :) Then Kamal's facial expression when Sita says her<br />      name is K Malam (Kamalam). And the moment in the car when Gemini refuses to<br />      stop for a worker dying of injury. My only regret is the ending whichis too<br />      dramatic, could have been made little subtle but ok.</p>
<p>      Thanneer Thaneer was very good movie too but credit for that goes to the<br />      original play by Komal Swaminathan.</p>

<p>UMT had so many moments that were Balachander at his best.including humor..like Gemini says 'Nalla maatukku oru soodu da' and Kamal goes 'mattukku thaane appa :) Then Kamal's facial expression when Sita says her name is K Malam (Kamalam). And the moment in the car when Gemini refuses to stop for a worker dying of injury. My only regret is the ending which is too dramatic, could have been made little subtle but ok.</p>
<p>Thanneer Thaneer was very good movie too but credit for that goes to the original play by Komal Swaminathan.</p>

        <p>-hi Vairam,<br />The dialogue of Vedham puthithu is like evergreen punch dialogue.In most of the Bhagyaraj films also had such type sensitive messages like "naalu pathni perai sollunga" I think you know the full dialogues.Its really a wonderful scene but i dont know the name of the film. </p>

<p>  Speaking on Widow remarriage (already discussed movie ratha kanner) I would like to mention one of Barathiraja's lesser known movies ' pasumpon' . Ireally loved the movie. Prabhu goes away from his mother after her mother gets remarried and gets baby out of that marriage. Very sensitive subject and brilliantly handled one.</p>

<p>    We have had discussion on books and songs before..was wondering if we could talk on movies that have impacted people's lives somehow. If possible let us not talk of out and out entertainers or fan based movies, just what had some emotional impact at some stage in our life (I still remember Satish's argument on 'what chagned our life' so am not using that phrase:))) My list is as below...</p>
<p>    1 Avvaiyaar - This movie inspired my interest in tamil and tamil literature, i watched it at age 6 or so with my grandmother and she explained most of songs/lyrics. At age 8 or 9 when most students went for Hindi as second language I opted for Tamil and this movie was inspiring in that regard. Although most of the movie appears to be fiction (ascertained via Thiru Vairam!) it is still very inspiring for KBS's performance as Avvai and some glimpses into Sangam period.</p>
<p>    2 Unnaal Mudiyum Thambi - KB Masterpiece with great performances by Kamal/Manorama and all. Don't think there is any need to say more.</p>
<p>    3 Sumaithaangi - somewhat less known flop movie by Sridhar with off beat story, great performances by Muthuraman/Gemini. Very memorable for KD songs particularly the inspiring Mayakkama..Kalakkama which is on top of KD songs for most people.</p>
<p>    4 Paavamannippu - religious integration and great music again. I watched this movie with my best friend who was a muslim while in 7th or 8th gradeand it made us even closer. </p>
<p>    5 Paasamalar/Lavakusa - emotional outlets, am ranking both these moviestogether as both are tearjerkers, but if you live 6000 miles from home youwill realize how much you need them! Pasamalar everyone knows enough although I regard the story as completely unrealistic it is very watchable for many reasons other than that. Lavakusa, outstanding music and the best portrayal of Uttar Kanada on movie screen.</p>
<p>    Waiting to hear from all!!</p>

        <p>I remember just the movie..not the name...<br />Balachandar's movie</p>
<p>Saritha's first i guess. She comes in as comercial sex worker.<br />Rajnikanth as a rowdy. They get married and try to get reformed. But they end up again in the same way as they started. </p>
<p>Very nice movie but not able to remember the name, if any body can give thename I would be really happy.</p>
<p>....<br />Ratha kaneer is a brilliant movie . Still it can be enjoyed! Literally Vivek would have lifted each of MRR reaction in so many comedy scenes.</p>
<p>Oru veedu iruvasal, Achamillai Achamillai are also good movies from Balachandar.<br />....<br />Like IMDB some on should start Tamil movie list. Esp this generation needs to see classics of the 60s-70s-80s.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Baabul: The fight of a single man to get back a life for his widowed daughter in law. </p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking on Widow remarriage (already discussed movie ratha kanner) I wouldlike to mention one of Barathiraja's lesser known movies ' pasumpon' . I really loved the movie. Prabhu goes away from his mother after her mother gets remarried and gets baby out of that marriage. Very sensitive subject andbrilliantly handled one.</p>
<p>I dont know how I missed Vedham Puthitu!!!!!<br />One dialogues still in my heart 'balu kirathu unga peru ...devar rathu neega vanguna patama?'... na karai eriten neenga innum kara eralaye!'<br />One of the most sensitive movies in Tamil.</p>
<blockquote><p> I agree with Vairam sir! </p></blockquote>
<p>Illavarasi,<br />Sir'a vitrungale ...romba formala iruku...makes me feel old..(I have noteven reached quarter century yet)!</p>

<blockquote><p>  I used to watch many movies before but now not htat much! The movies which are my favourite are:<br />  ?<br />  Punnagai: I agree with Vairam sir! The different smiles of each person......! I can't forget the scene where Jayanthi smiles when she?could have?been suspected by her hub. <br />  ?<br />  Nenjam marapadhillai: A story of rebirth. The songs and especially the humming by Mrs.P.Suseela in the title song takes us into the story.<br />  ?<br />  Lage chunari mein daang: A Rani Mukerjee starrer film in Hindi. Rani is forced to go astray because of her family situation. And her life thereaftermakes the story.<br />  ?<br />  Pudhu vasantham: One of the few Tamil movies where love goes to the second place.

Can anyone forget those dialogues?<br />  ?<br />  Ratha kanneer: Mr.M.R.Radha's casual act and strong screenplay.

<p>  We have had discussion on books and songs before..was wondering if we could talk on movies that have impacted people's lives somehow. If possible let us not talk of out and out entertainers or fan based movies, just what had some emotional impact at some stage in our life (I still remember Satish's argument on 'what chagned our life' so am not using that phrase:))) My list is as below...</p>
<p>  1 Avvaiyaar - This movie inspired my interest in tamil and tamil literature, i watched it at age 6 or so with my grandmother and she explained most of songs/lyrics. At age 8 or 9 when most students went for Hindi as second language I opted for Tamil and this movie was inspiring in that regard. Although most of the movie appears to be fiction (ascertained via Thiru Vairam!) it is still very inspiring for KBS's performance as Avvai and some glimpses into Sangam period.</p>
<p>  2 Unnaal Mudiyum Thambi - KB Masterpiece with great performances by Kamal/Manorama and all. Don't think there is any need to say more.</p>
<p>  3 Sumaithaangi - somewhat less known flop movie by Sridhar with off beat story, great performances by Muthuraman/Gemini. Very memorable for KD songsparticularly the inspiring Mayakkama..Kalakkama which is on top of KD songs for most people.</p>
<p>  4 Paavamannippu - religious integration and great music again. I watched this movie with my best friend who was a muslim while in 7th or 8th grade and it made us even closer. </p>
<p>  5 Paasamalar/Lavakusa - emotional outlets, am ranking both these movies together as both are tearjerkers, but if you live 6000 miles from home you will realize how much you need them! Pasamalar everyone knows enough although I regard the story as completely unrealistic it is very watchable for many reasons other than that. Lavakusa, outstanding music and the best portrayal of Uttar Kanada on movie screen.</p>
<p>  Waiting to hear from all!!</p>
