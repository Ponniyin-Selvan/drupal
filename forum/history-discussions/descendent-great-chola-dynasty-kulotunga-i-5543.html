</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>Kulothunga I's father was Rajaraja Narendran I of Eastern Chalukya.<br />Mother Ammanga Devi d/o Great Rajendra I.<br />Rajaraja Narendran was born to Vimaladithan, whose wife was Kundavi <br />D/o RRC - I.</p>
<p>Therefore Kulothunga I (also known as Vikramaditha VII - Birth Star <br />POOSAM) is GRANDSON of Rajendra I through his daughter. He was also <br />Grandson of Kundavi (D/o RRC) + Vimaladithan ! He was Yuvaraja-<br />designate of VENGI. Rajaraja Narendra ruled VENGI from 1018 - 1059.</p>
<p>There was one VIJAYADITHA VII.</p>
<p>He was son of VIMALADITHA, not through Kundavi, but another Wife.<br />His son was SAKTHIVARMAN. They assisted Rajaraja Narendra I- means <br />Kulothunga's father and positioned in VENGI.</p>
<p>In 1060, Narendra died. Kulothunga did not prefer to succeed the <br />throne. His Sithappa VIJAYADITHA VII occupied the throne. <br />Kulothunga invaded farther North - Sakkarakottam etc.</p>
<p>Chalukya Vikramaditha VI invaded Vengi. Veera Rajendran (1063 - <br />1070) s/o Rajendra I interfered, defeated Vikramaditha VI and <br />restored Vijayaditha VII.</p>
<p>When Veera Rajendran died in 1070, Vijayaditha VII, put Parakesari <br />Adhi Rajendran, s/o Veera Rajendran, in GKC Chozha throne. Adhi <br />Rajendra also died in 1070.</p>
<p>Now KULOTHUNGA returned to Gangai Konda Chozhapuram (GKC) from <br />Sakkarakottam and Crowned himself as Chozha King.</p>
<p>Vijayaditha VII continued as VENGI King.</p>
<p>Dr. Rasamanickanar, in his Chozhar Varalaru, whole heartedly <br />appreciates KAN Sastry :: </p>
<p>Dr. Rasamanickanar concludes:</p>
<p>1. Vengi inscriptions describe Kulothunga prior to becoming Chozha <br />king in a particular way; 2. Vikramanga Deva Saritham describes the same in another way; 3. Kalingathuparani describes in a different way.</p>
<p>It is Sastry, who went into every detail and arrived at the true <br />picture ! Ref Sastry's The Colas (Pages 338 - 358 ).</p>

<p>For instance, Rajaraja's daughter Kundhavai marries Vimaladitya,<br />the Chalukya.  <br />Narendra s/o Kundavai + Vimaladitha married Ammanga Devi,<br />the daughter of Rajendra. Their son is Kulothunga Chola I (Eastern <br />chalukya clan). <br />He marries the daughter Madurantaki of<br />Rajendra II who is the brother of AmmangaDevi.</p>
<p>====================================<br />RAJENDRA HAD 3 SONS : THEY RULED BETWEEN 1044 - 1070.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Rajakesari RAJATHIRAJAN :: 1018 - 1054. Co-ruled with Rajendra <br />from <br />  1018 to 1044. Defeated Chalukyas in 1044-45. He died in 1054 in <br />  KOPPAM BATTLE On the banks of Krishna River against Agavamallan.<br />  Was also known as King Who died on the Elephant.</p>
<p>  Parakesari RAJENDRA CHOZHA DEVAR :: 1052 - 1064. Co-ruled with <br />  Rajadithan till he died in 1054. In the same Koppam battle <br />Field, <br />  he pronounced himself as the King and defeated Jayasimhan, <br />  Pulikesin, Dasapanman &amp; Nanni Nulamban and killed them. <br />Agavamallan <br />  left the battle field. He waged a war against Lanka too.</p>
<p>  Rajakesari RAJAMAHENDRAN :: S/o aforersaid Rajendra Chozha Devar. <br />  Was Yuvaraja 1060 - 1073.</p>
<p>  Rajakesari VEERARAJENDRAN :: 1063 - 1069. Also known as Karikalan.</p>
<p>  Parakesari ADHIRAJENDRAN :: 1069 - 1070 S/o Veerarajendran.<br />  ============================================<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />KULOTHUNGA I was born to RjC's daughter AMMANGA DEVI and RAJARAJA </p></blockquote>
<p>NARENDRAN (ruled Vengi 1018 - 1059) in 1043 - Star Poosam. He was <br />also named as Rajendran after RjC in conformity with Chozha clan.  <br />ALSO WAS KNOWN AS VISHNUVARDHANAN - VII.<br />=========================================</p>
<p>There was one VIJAYADITHAN - VII, born to VIMALADITHAN, thro" the <br />step mother of Rajaraja Narendran. He assisted RR Narendran. </p>
<p>============================================== </p>
<p>Sakthivarman was s/o Vijayadithan VII. KULOTHUNGA was already </p>
<blockquote><p>  declared Yuvaraja and was in Vengi / Chakrakottam.</p>
<p>  After Adhirajendra's death in 1070, KULOTHUNGA rushed to GANGAI <br />  KONDA CHOZHAPURAM and BECAME CHOZHA KING.  <br />  Aforesaid Vijayaditha VII was ruling Vengi.</p>
<p>  After this, there were various polarisation among Kings in <br />various <br />  parts of Deccan ..</p>

<p>Dear Viswaksenan</p>
<p>pls see whether this helps::</p>
<p>====================================<br />RAJENDRA HAD 3 SONS : THEY RULED BETWEEN 1044 - 1070.</p>
<p>Rajakesari RAJATHIRAJAN :: 1018 - 1054. Co-ruled with Rajendra <br />from 1018 to 1044. Defeated Chalukyas in 1044-45. He died in 1054 in KOPPAM BATTLE On the banks of Krishna River against Agavamallan.<br />Was also known as King Who died on the Elephant.</p>
<p>Parakesari RAJENDRA CHOZHA DEVAR :: 1052 - 1064. Co-ruled with <br />Rajadithan till he died in 1054. In the same Koppam battle <br />Field, he pronounced himself as the King and defeated Jayasimhan, Pulikesin, Dasapanman &amp; Nanni Nulamban and killed them. Agavamallan left the battle field. He waged a war against Lanka too.</p>
<p>Rajakesari RAJAMAHENDRAN :: S/o aforersaid Rajendra Chozha Devar. <br />Was Yuvaraja 1060 - 1073.</p>
<p>Rajakesari VEERARAJENDRAN :: 1063 - 1069. Also known as Karikalan.</p>
<p>Parakesari ADHIRAJENDRAN :: 1069 - 1070 S/o Veerarajendran.<br />============================================<br />-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Kulothunga I's father was Rajaraja Narendran I of Eastern Chalukya.<br />Mother Ammanga Devi d/o Great Rajendra I.<br />Rajaraja Narendran was born to Vimaladithan, whose wife was Kundavi <br />D/o RRC - I.</p>
<p>Therefore Kulothunga I (also known as Vikramaditha VII - Birth Star <br />POOSAM) is GRANDSON of Rajendra I through his daughter. He was also <br />Grandson of Kundavi (D/o RRC) + Vimaladithan ! He was Yuvaraja-<br />designate of VENGI. Rajaraja Narendra ruled VENGI from 1018 - 1059.</p>
<p>There was one VIJAYADITHA VII.</p>
<p>He was son of VIMALADITHA, not through Kundavi, but another Wife.<br />His son was SAKTHIVARMAN. They assisted Rajaraja Narendra I- means <br />Kulothunga's father and positioned in VENGI.</p>
<p>In 1060, Narendra died. Kulothunga did not prefer to succeed the <br />throne. His Sithappa VIJAYADITHA VII occupied the throne. <br />Kulothunga invaded farther North - Sakkarakottam etc.</p>
<p>Chalukya Vikramaditha VI invaded Vengi. Veera Rajendran (1063 - <br />1070) s/o Rajendra I interfered, defeated Vikramaditha VI and <br />restored Vijayaditha VII.</p>
<p>When Veera Rajendran died in 1070, Vijayaditha VII, put Parakesari <br />Adhi Rajendran, s/o Veera Rajendran, in GKC Chozha throne. Adhi <br />Rajendra also died in 1070.</p>
<p>Now KULOTHUNGA returned to Gangai Konda Chozhapuram (GKC) from <br />Sakkarakottam and Crowned himself as Chozha King.</p>
<p>Vijayaditha VII continued as VENGI King.</p>
<p>Dr. Rasamanickanar, in his Chozhar Varalaru, whole heartedly <br />appreciates KAN Sastry :: </p>
<p>Dr. Rasamanickanar concludes:</p>
<p>1. Vengi inscriptions describe Kulothunga prior to becoming Chozha <br />king in a particular way; 2. Vikramanga Deva Saritham describes the same in another way; 3. Kalingathuparani describes in a different way.</p>

<p>For instance, Rajaraja's daughter Kundhavai marries Vimaladitya,<br />the Chalukya. Narendra s/o Kundavai + Vimaladitha married Ammanga Devi, the daughter of Rajendra. </p>
<p>Their son is Kulothunga Chola I (Eastern chalukya clan). <br />He marries the daughter Madurantaki of<br />Rajendra II who is the brother of AmmangaDevi.<br />KULOTHUNGA I was born to RjC's daughter AMMANGA DEVI and RAJARAJA <br />NARENDRAN (ruled Vengi 1018 - 1059) in 1043 - Star Poosam. He was <br />also named as Rajendran after RjC in conformity with Chozha clan.  </p>
<blockquote><p>  ALSO WAS KNOWN AS VISHNUVARDHANAN - VII.<br />  =========================================</p>
<p>  There was one VIJAYADITHAN - VII, born to VIMALADITHAN, thro" the <br />  step mother of Rajaraja Narendran. He assisted RR Narendran. </p>
<p>  ============================================== </p>
<p>  Sakthivarman was s/o Vijayadithan VII. KULOTHUNGA was already <br />    declared Yuvaraja and was in Vengi / Chakrakottam.</p>
<p>    After Adhirajendra's death in 1070, KULOTHUNGA rushed to GANGAI <br />    KONDA CHOZHAPURAM and BECAME CHOZHA KING.  <br />    Aforesaid Vijayaditha VII was ruling Vengi.</p>

<p>        2) we see that this was not strictly followed for cholas, but<br />    how<br />        about others.</p>
<p>        3) is it mandatory that the king should take a pattamahishi to<br />    be<br />        crowned ( as kalki writes in SS - when mamalla is being<br />    convinced<br />      by<br />        mahendrar)</p>

<p>        5) was raja raja narendra the crown prince.</p>
<p>        6) who was vijayaditha' s mother and from which clan. ( i think<br />    in<br />        mannan magal she is shown as the daugther of jayasimhan!! !)</p>
<p>        7) if raja raja narendra rules from 1018 onwards, then ammanga<br />      devi<br />        could not be his pattamahishi - as the ganges campaign was only<br />    in<br />        1019 - return to GKC 1022 and tent marriage during that period.</p>

<p>        hi sir</p>
<p>        thanks - some questions again</p>
<p>        1) who is the crown prince - first born male son of the king or<br />      son<br />        of the pattmahishi.</p>
<p>        2) we see that this was not strictly followed for cholas, but<br />    how<br />        about others.</p>
<p>        3) is it mandatory that the king should take a pattamahishi to<br />    be<br />        crowned ( as kalki writes in SS - when mamalla is being<br />    convinced<br />      by<br />        mahendrar)</p>
<p>        4) any tent dates for crowning of vimaladityan and if so was<br />      kundavi<br />        his pattamahishi.</p>
<p>        5) was raja raja narendra the crown prince.</p>
<p>        6) who was vijayaditha's mother and from which clan. ( i think<br />    in<br />        mannan magal she is shown as the daugther of jayasimhan!!!)</p>
<p>        7) if raja raja narendra rules from 1018 onwards, then ammanga<br />      devi<br />        could not be his pattamahishi - as the ganges campaign was only<br />    in<br />        1019 - return to GKC 1022 and tent marriage during that period.</p>

<p>          Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>          Kulothunga I's father was Rajaraja Narendran I of Eastern<br />      Chalukya.<br />          Mother Ammanga Devi d/o Great Rajendra I.<br />          Rajaraja Narendran was born to Vimaladithan, whose wife was<br />        Kundavi<br />          D/o RRC - I.</p>
<p>          Therefore Kulothunga I (also known as Vikramaditha VII - Birth<br />        Star<br />          POOSAM) is GRANDSON of Rajendra I through his daughter. He was<br />        also<br />          Grandson of Kundavi (D/o RRC) + Vimaladithan ! He was Yuvaraja-<br />          designate of VENGI. Rajaraja Narendra ruled VENGI from 1018 -<br />      1059.</p>
<p>          There was one VIJAYADITHA VII.</p>
<p>          He was son of VIMALADITHA, not through Kundavi, but another<br />    Wife.<br />          His son was SAKTHIVARMAN. They assisted Rajaraja Narendra I-<br />        means<br />          Kulothunga's father and positioned in VENGI.</p>
<p>          In 1060, Narendra died. Kulothunga did not prefer to succeed<br />    the<br />          throne. His Sithappa VIJAYADITHA VII occupied the throne.<br />          Kulothunga invaded farther North - Sakkarakottam etc.</p>
<p>          Chalukya Vikramaditha VI invaded Vengi. Veera Rajendran<br />    (1063 -<br />          1070) s/o Rajendra I interfered, defeated Vikramaditha VI and<br />          restored Vijayaditha VII.</p>
<p>          When Veera Rajendran died in 1070, Vijayaditha VII, put<br />      Parakesari<br />          Adhi Rajendran, s/o Veera Rajendran, in GKC Chozha throne.<br />    Adhi<br />          Rajendra also died in 1070.</p>
<p>          Now KULOTHUNGA returned to Gangai Konda Chozhapuram (GKC) from<br />          Sakkarakottam and Crowned himself as Chozha King.</p>
<p>          Vijayaditha VII continued as VENGI King.</p>

<p>          Dr. Rasamanickanar concludes:</p>
<p>          1. Vengi inscriptions describe Kulothunga prior to becoming<br />      Chozha<br />          king in a particular way;           2. Vikramanga Deva Saritham describes the same in another way;           3. Kalingathuparani describes in a different way.</p>
<p>          It is Sastry, who went into every detail and arrived at the<br />    true<br />          picture ! Ref Sastry's The Colas (Pages 338 - 358 ).</p>

<p>      hi sir</p>
<p>      thanks - some questions again</p>
<p>      1) who is the crown prince - first born male son of the king or<br />    son<br />      of the pattmahishi.</p>
<p>      2) we see that this was not strictly followed for cholas, but<br />  how<br />      about others.</p>
<p>      3) is it mandatory that the king should take a pattamahishi to<br />  be<br />      crowned ( as kalki writes in SS - when mamalla is being<br />  convinced<br />    by<br />      mahendrar)</p>
<p>      4) any tent dates for crowning of vimaladityan and if so was<br />    kundavi<br />      his pattamahishi.</p>
<p>      5) was raja raja narendra the crown prince.</p>
<p>      6) who was vijayaditha's mother and from which clan. ( i think<br />  in<br />      mannan magal she is shown as the daugther of jayasimhan!!!)</p>
<p>      7) if raja raja narendra rules from 1018 onwards, then ammanga<br />    devi<br />      could not be his pattamahishi - as the ganges campaign was only<br />  in<br />      1019 - return to GKC 1022 and tent marriage during that period.</p>

<p>        Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>        Kulothunga I's father was Rajaraja Narendran I of Eastern<br />    Chalukya.<br />        Mother Ammanga Devi d/o Great Rajendra I.<br />        Rajaraja Narendran was born to Vimaladithan, whose wife was<br />      Kundavi<br />        D/o RRC - I.</p>
<p>        Therefore Kulothunga I (also known as Vikramaditha VII - Birth<br />      Star<br />        POOSAM) is GRANDSON of Rajendra I through his daughter. He was<br />      also<br />        Grandson of Kundavi (D/o RRC) + Vimaladithan ! He was Yuvaraja-<br />        designate of VENGI. Rajaraja Narendra ruled VENGI from 1018 -<br />    1059.</p>
<p>        There was one VIJAYADITHA VII.</p>
<p>        He was son of VIMALADITHA, not through Kundavi, but another<br />  Wife.<br />        His son was SAKTHIVARMAN. They assisted Rajaraja Narendra I-<br />      means<br />        Kulothunga's father and positioned in VENGI.</p>
<p>        In 1060, Narendra died. Kulothunga did not prefer to succeed<br />  the<br />        throne. His Sithappa VIJAYADITHA VII occupied the throne.<br />        Kulothunga invaded farther North - Sakkarakottam etc.</p>

<p>      hi sir</p>
<p>      thanks - some questions again</p>
<p>      1) who is the crown prince - first born male son of the king or<br />    son<br />      of the pattmahishi.</p>
<p>      2) we see that this was not strictly followed for cholas, but<br />  how<br />      about others.</p>
<p>      3) is it mandatory that the king should take a pattamahishi to<br />  be<br />      crowned ( as kalki writes in SS - when mamalla is being<br />  convinced<br />    by<br />      mahendrar)</p>
<p>      4) any tent dates for crowning of vimaladityan and if so was<br />    kundavi<br />      his pattamahishi.</p>
<p>      5) was raja raja narendra the crown prince.</p>
<p>      6) who was vijayaditha's mother and from which clan. ( i think<br />  in<br />      mannan magal she is shown as the daugther of jayasimhan!!!)</p>
<p>      7) if raja raja narendra rules from 1018 onwards, then ammanga<br />    devi<br />      could not be his pattamahishi - as the ganges campaign was only<br />  in<br />      1019 - return to GKC 1022 and tent marriage during that period.</p>

<p>        Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>        Kulothunga I's father was Rajaraja Narendran I of Eastern<br />    Chalukya.<br />        Mother Ammanga Devi d/o Great Rajendra I.<br />        Rajaraja Narendran was born to Vimaladithan, whose wife was<br />      Kundavi<br />        D/o RRC - I.</p>
<p>        Therefore Kulothunga I (also known as Vikramaditha VII - Birth<br />      Star<br />        POOSAM) is GRANDSON of Rajendra I through his daughter. He was<br />      also<br />        Grandson of Kundavi (D/o RRC) + Vimaladithan ! He was Yuvaraja-<br />        designate of VENGI. Rajaraja Narendra ruled VENGI from 1018 -<br />    1059.</p>
<p>        There was one VIJAYADITHA VII.</p>
<p>        He was son of VIMALADITHA, not through Kundavi, but another<br />  Wife.<br />        His son was SAKTHIVARMAN. They assisted Rajaraja Narendra I-<br />      means<br />        Kulothunga's father and positioned in VENGI.</p>
<p>        In 1060, Narendra died. Kulothunga did not prefer to succeed<br />  the<br />        throne. His Sithappa VIJAYADITHA VII occupied the throne.<br />        Kulothunga invaded farther North - Sakkarakottam etc.</p>
<p>        Chalukya Vikramaditha VI invaded Vengi. Veera Rajendran<br />  (1063 -<br />        1070) s/o Rajendra I interfered, defeated Vikramaditha VI and<br />        restored Vijayaditha VII.</p>
<p>        When Veera Rajendran died in 1070, Vijayaditha VII, put<br />    Parakesari<br />        Adhi Rajendran, s/o Veera Rajendran, in GKC Chozha throne.<br />  Adhi<br />        Rajendra also died in 1070.</p>
<p>        Now KULOTHUNGA returned to Gangai Konda Chozhapuram (GKC) from<br />        Sakkarakottam and Crowned himself as Chozha King.</p>

          Descendent of the Great Chola Dynasty :: Kulotunga I        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>KULOTHUNGA CHOLA 1</p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola 1 is partly eastern Chalukya also known as Vengi <br />Chalukyas</p>
<p>The first ruler of the Vengi Chalukya dynasty is Kubja Vishnuvardana<br />(624 AD to 641AD)</p>
<p>The 23rd ruler of this dynasty was Vimaladitya (1011 AD to 1018AD)</p>
<p>This Vimaladitya married Kundavai who was the daughter of our great <br />Raja Raja Chola and the sister of King Rajendra Chola 1.</p>
<p>Vimaladitya's son was Raja Raja Narendra.So for Raja Raja Narendra<br />His thaatha -Raja Raja Chola<br />His Amma -Kundavai<br />His Thaai Maaman -Rajendra Chola 1</p>
<p>With the help of his maternal uncle Rajendra Chola 1, Raja Raja <br />Narendra(1018 AD to 1061AD) became the 24 th ruler of the Vengi (or <br />Eastern) Chalukya Dynasty.</p>
<p>This Raja Raja Narendra married Ammangai (his maama Ponnu) daughter <br />of Rajendra Chola 1.</p>
<p>The son of Raja Raja Narendra was Rajendra Chalukya (Kulothunga Chola <br />1). Rajendra Chalukya spent much of his day in his maama veedu(Gangai <br />Konda Cholapuram)</p>
<p>Rajendra Chlaukya(Kulothunga 1) married Madurantaki Devi the daughter <br />of Rajendra Chola 2 (1054AD to 1063AD)</p>
<p>Rajendra Chola 2 had a brother -Virarajendra Chola and a son Raja <br />Mahendra.<br />Raja Mahendra died earlier before Rajendra Chola 2.</p>
<p>Vira Rajendra Chola was crowned as the Chola king in GangaiKonda <br />Cholapuram.</p>
<p>After the death of Vira Rajendra Chola his son Adhirajendra Chola was <br />assasinated in 1070AD.</p>
<p>With the assasination of Adhirajendra Chola there were no successors <br />from this Chola line.So Rajendra Chalukya ascended the Chola throne <br />as Kulothunga Chola 1.</p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola 1 also witnessed the end of the eastern Chalukya <br />dynasty.The last ruler of vengi Chaukya dynasty was Vijayaditya 7<br />(stepbrother of Kulothunga Chola's father RajaRaja Narendra).</p>
<p>With the death of Vijayaditya 7 in 1075 AD the eastern Chalukya <br />dynasty came to an end and vengi became a part of the <br />Chola empire.</p>

<p>    1) who is the crown prince - first born male son of the king or <br />  son <br />    of the pattmahishi.</p>
<p>    2) we see that this was not strictly followed for cholas, but <br />how <br />    about others.</p>
<p>    3) is it mandatory that the king should take a pattamahishi to <br />be <br />    crowned ( as kalki writes in SS - when mamalla is being <br />convinced <br />  by <br />    mahendrar)</p>
<p>    4) any tent dates for crowning of vimaladityan and if so was <br />  kundavi <br />    his pattamahishi.</p>

<p>      Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>      Kulothunga I's father was Rajaraja Narendran I of Eastern <br />  Chalukya.<br />      Mother Ammanga Devi d/o Great Rajendra I.<br />      Rajaraja Narendran was born to Vimaladithan, whose wife was <br />    Kundavi <br />      D/o RRC - I.</p>
<p>      Therefore Kulothunga I (also known as Vikramaditha VII - Birth <br />    Star <br />      POOSAM) is GRANDSON of Rajendra I through his daughter. He was <br />    also <br />      Grandson of Kundavi (D/o RRC) + Vimaladithan ! He was Yuvaraja-<br />      designate of VENGI. Rajaraja Narendra ruled VENGI from 1018 - <br />  1059.</p>
<p>      There was one VIJAYADITHA VII.</p>
<p>      He was son of VIMALADITHA, not through Kundavi, but another <br />Wife.<br />      His son was SAKTHIVARMAN. They assisted Rajaraja Narendra I- <br />    means <br />      Kulothunga's father and positioned in VENGI.</p>
<p>      In 1060, Narendra died. Kulothunga did not prefer to succeed <br />the <br />      throne. His Sithappa VIJAYADITHA VII occupied the throne. <br />      Kulothunga invaded farther North - Sakkarakottam etc.</p>
<p>      Chalukya Vikramaditha VI invaded Vengi. Veera Rajendran <br />(1063 - <br />      1070) s/o Rajendra I interfered, defeated Vikramaditha VI and <br />      restored Vijayaditha VII.</p>
<p>      When Veera Rajendran died in 1070, Vijayaditha VII, put <br />  Parakesari <br />      Adhi Rajendran, s/o Veera Rajendran, in GKC Chozha throne. <br />Adhi <br />      Rajendra also died in 1070.</p>
<p>      Now KULOTHUNGA returned to Gangai Konda Chozhapuram (GKC) from <br />      Sakkarakottam and Crowned himself as Chozha King.</p>
<p>      Vijayaditha VII continued as VENGI King.</p>
<p>      Dr. Rasamanickanar, in his Chozhar Varalaru, whole heartedly <br />      appreciates KAN Sastry :: </p>
<p>      Dr. Rasamanickanar concludes:</p>
<p>      1. Vengi inscriptions describe Kulothunga prior to becoming <br />  Chozha <br />      king in a particular way;       2. Vikramanga Deva Saritham describes the same in another way;       3. Kalingathuparani describes in a different way.</p>
