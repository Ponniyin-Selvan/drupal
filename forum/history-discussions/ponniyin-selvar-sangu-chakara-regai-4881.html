        <p>Dear Vijay,<br />The JB note on 'kAVIRAYAR' was quite interesting. For everything and for every incident we have no answer of proof. We have several such incidents happening in South India too but when you search for authentic sources, nothing we would get. And That is India.<br />Dhivakar.</p>
<p>"Vijay Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@yahoo.com.sg  wrote:<br />posting this interesting note for Prof JB from agathiar.</vj_episteme@yahoo.com.sg></p>
<p>When I was working in the State of Kelantan in the<br />East Coast of Malaya, I was posted to the General Hospital of<br />the State capital called Kota Bahru.<br />I was taking a very active part in politics, in religious<br />activities and youth activities at that time. I was closely <br />associated<br />with ministers; I founded the Malaysia Hindu Sangam of Kelantan State<br />and was its first president. I was the founder and co-ordinator of<br />Tamil Youth Bell Club for the States of Trengganu and Kelantan.<br />Anyone coming to Kelantan would make it a point to visit me<br />and spend time with me, especially the Indian VIP's.<br />One day I received a letter from one Swamiji about<br />another Swamiji. He was from ThirukkuLambur.<br />On the stipulated day, he arrived.<br />But he was far from looking like a Swamiji.</p>
<p>He had a rugged and rustic look. He was wearing a silk jibba<br />and eight mulza veshti. He had an angavasthram. His hair was grown<br />upto the nape of his neck into a type of Baghavathar Crop. He had<br />a thick bristling moustache. There were streaks of grey in his hair<br />and moustache. He was tall and well-built. The complexion was dark.<br />His eyes were large and bulging and his vision was divergent.<br />He looked more like a Rasputin without beard.<br />He looked like having arrived from some medieval times by<br />a time-machine.<br />He stayed in our house for more than a month. But this was the<br />beginning of a friendship which lasted for several years. He made<br />several trips from India and followed us to several places wherever<br />we went.<br />His name was Alzagu Ramaiyya. He said that he belonged to<br />a branch of the Cholzas. In fact, he had a family name - 'Cholzagar'.<br />He had a strange story to tell.<br />When he was young, he was a rowdy. He used to play pranks.<br />One day he was sleeping in a KaLi temple. He had a dream in<br />which KaLi appeared and asked him to drink a small vessel of honey.<br />She also wrote some atcharam on his tongue with Her Trisulam.<br />Chenthamilz.<br />The noteworthy thing here, is that, he was illiterate.<br />When he received letters from India, he would ask one of us<br />to read them for him. And somebody would have to write his letters<br />for him.<br />But yet, he sang songs and poems like a versatile poet. And<br />he could speak in clear well-versed Tamil. He could give speeches<br />in good Tamil. And he would speak about religion, spirituality, and<br />ithihasas and puranas.<br />So we named him 'The Kavirayar'.<br />But he preferred to call himself by another name -<br />'Kalai Maa Muni'.</p>
<p>About the Kavirayar belonging to the Cholza clan.......</p>
<p>The Cholzas have a legendary history from the dim past.<br />Manunidhi Cholzan, Sibi, and some others have a remote past.<br />During the third Sangam, we come across Karikalan,<br />NalangiLLi, NalangiLLi, an several others. Karikaalan's many<br />descendants started several royal dynasties in India and South<br />East Asia.<br />They were dormant for 600 years. We come across<br />KopperunchOlzan, and the father of Mangayarkkarasi wife of<br />NerumARa Pandyan, and a few others.</p>
<p>The Cholzas were under the Pallavas. In the frequent wars<br />waged by the Pallavas and the Pandyas, the Cholzas took sides.<br />Then when both the overlords wore themselves out, the Cholzas<br />took over from the Pallavas. Then they overcame the Pandyas<br />and conquered a large territory. Thus the Imperial Cholzas came<br />into being. RajaRaja and Rajendra belong to this line.</p>
<p>In 1216, Maravaraman Sundara Pandya I over-ran the<br />Chola Empire during the rule of Kuloththunga III. Soon after<br />the defeat, Kuloththunga died. His son RajaRaja III came to<br />the throne. But during the war, he was imprisoned by his own<br />feudatory, Kopperunjingga of Thirukkovaluur.<br />Due to the intervention of the Hoysala emperor of<br />Mysore, who happened to be RajaRaja's father-in-law,<br />MS Pandya gave back the Chola Mandala to RajaRaja III.<br />But something happened. So MS Pandya attacked again in<br />1246. Soon after that MSPandya died and two kings came<br />to power in quick succession. They were weak. The Hoysala<br />NaraSimha made use of this opportunity because by this time<br />he had become the father-in-law of Maravarman Sundara<br />Pandya II also. So he extended his territory from Mysore<br />right across Coimbatore, Dindigal, and Tiruchi where he built<br />a huge fortress at Samayapuram.<br />Thus he craeted a Hoysala wedge in Tamilnadu,<br />effectively separating the Cholzas in the north and the<br />Pandyas in the south.</p>
<p>The last Chola emperor belonging to the Imperial Cholas<br />was Rajendra III. He came to the throne in 1256 A.D. He was<br />the son of RajaRaja III.</p>
<p>He defeated MS Pandya II in a war. But the Hoysala<br />took the Pandiyan side this time, to prevent a revival of<br />Cholziyan Imperialism. But Jatavarman Sundara Pandya, the<br />greatest conqueror among the later Pandyas came to power<br />in 1251.</p>
<p>He started on an expansionist policy and conquered Chera,<br />Chola,Ceylon and the Telugu Choda territories and also got rid<br />of the Hoysalas.</p>
<p>But JS Pandya died in 1268 and was succeeded by<br />Maravarman Kulasekhara Pandya, the last of the Grand Pandyas.</p>
<p>There was a last major war in which Rajendra III allied<br />himself with Hoysala Ramanatha, the son of Narasimha. But this<br />grand alliance was totally defeated by MKPandya.<br />This war took place in 1279.<br />And that is the last that we hear of Rajendra III and<br />the Cholas.<br />There is a group of people belonging to a particular<br />community. They claim to be the descendants of the Cholas.<br />Until about 40 years ago, one of the families belonging to<br />this community used to hold a symbolic coronation ceremony<br />in the Chidhambaram Temple just as their fore-runners did.</p>
<p>The Kavirayar belongs to one of the kudis of this clan of<br />people. They call themselves 'Cholzagar' which is occassionally<br />used as a title.</p>
<p>He had the help of a deity who used to do his bidding.<br />The deity carried a weapon called 'uLi' and used to ride a horse.<br />I am concealing his name. This is a different deity. Not the one<br />that you think.<br />There were also other deities whom he would invoke at times.<br />Also some spirits which would come to him when called.<br />Normally he would apply high quality perfumes. He is<br />seldom without them. But there were times when some bad odour<br />would be around when he is involved in doing some 'kalzichchal'<br />for somebody.<br />But when he passes into the Kavirayar personality, he does<br />not do all this type of work.<br />It was in 1984.<br />I was in a place called Kota Tinggi. The Kavirayar had come<br />to a place called Malacca on his own. He was staying at someone's<br />house. But his frequent pujais disturbed the household very much<br />and they sent him to Kota Tinggi. We made him stay in a room on<br />his own with its own bathroom. It was an old type of British Bungalow<br />quarters. Windows with slit-like shutters and huge doors.<br />After he came to Kota Tinggi, the time came for him to<br />renew his visa.<br />But to his horror, he could not find the passport and other<br />documents. He said that he had placed them in a brown paper<br />envelope and had kept in his 'trunkupetti'.<br />But it was not there.<br />He was very upset.<br />The next morning, he got up very early and took a bath.<br />Without combing his hair and wearing only a towel on his waist,<br />he smeared his arms and fore-head and his chest and belly<br />with kunkumam.<br />Then he jumped and said, "$%#@ *&amp;$3 avanukkaachchu<br />enakkaachchu.....&amp;%$# paaththuppuduvONdaa.....@##$%".<br />He liberally used foul words when he was not in the Kavirayar<br />personality.<br />Then he sat on a sofa in the hall and refused to talk anything<br />nor eat anything.<br />He was unusually silent.<br />Suddenly he jumped up.<br />There was a sound of commotion outside his room.<br />I saw something being dropped through the slit in the window<br />frame-work. Then there was a noise of somebody running away. And<br />there was the sound of hoofs. Horses hoofs.<br />There are no horses anywhere near Kota Tinggi.<br />The Kavirayar was jumping and ran towards the noise shouting,<br />"pidraa avaney..... pidraa...pirdraa....pidraa!"<br />We all rushed outside.<br />There was nothing there. Nobody.<br />No foot marks.<br />And no hoof-marks.<br />The Kavirayar ran back into the house.<br />He picked up the object that had dropped through the window.<br />It was a brown envelope.<br />Inside it, was the passport and all the documents.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>posting this interesting note for Prof JB from agathiar.</p>
<p>When I was working in the State of Kelantan in the<br />East Coast of Malaya, I was posted to the General Hospital of<br />the State capital called Kota Bahru.<br />I was taking a very active part in politics, in religious<br />activities and youth activities at that time. I was closely <br />associated<br />with ministers; I founded the Malaysia Hindu Sangam of Kelantan State<br />and was its first president. I was the founder and co-ordinator of<br />Tamil Youth Bell Club for the States of Trengganu and Kelantan.<br />Anyone coming to Kelantan would make it a point to visit me<br />and spend time with me, especially the Indian VIP's.<br />One day I received a letter from one Swamiji about<br />another Swamiji. He was from ThirukkuLambur.<br />On the stipulated day, he arrived.<br />But he was far from looking like a Swamiji.</p>
<p>He had a rugged and rustic look. He was wearing a silk jibba<br />and eight mulza veshti. He had an angavasthram. His hair was grown<br />upto the nape of his neck into a type of Baghavathar Crop. He had<br />a thick bristling moustache. There were streaks of grey in his hair<br />and moustache. He was tall and well-built. The complexion was dark.<br />His eyes were large and bulging and his vision was divergent.<br />He looked more like a Rasputin without beard.<br />He looked like having arrived from some medieval times by<br />a time-machine.<br />He stayed in our house for more than a month. But this was the<br />beginning of a friendship which lasted for several years. He made<br />several trips from India and followed us to several places wherever<br />we went.<br />His name was Alzagu Ramaiyya. He said that he belonged to<br />a branch of the Cholzas. In fact, he had a family name - 'Cholzagar'.<br />He had a strange story to tell.<br />When he was young, he was a rowdy. He used to play pranks.<br />One day he was sleeping in a KaLi temple. He had a dream in<br />which KaLi appeared and asked him to drink a small vessel of honey.<br />She also wrote some atcharam on his tongue with Her Trisulam.<br />Chenthamilz.<br />The noteworthy thing here, is that, he was illiterate.<br />When he received letters from India, he would ask one of us<br />to read them for him. And somebody would have to write his letters<br />for him.<br />But yet, he sang songs and poems like a versatile poet. And<br />he could speak in clear well-versed Tamil. He could give speeches<br />in good Tamil. And he would speak about religion, spirituality, and<br />ithihasas and puranas.<br />So we named him 'The Kavirayar'.<br />But he preferred to call himself by another name -<br />'Kalai Maa Muni'.</p>
<p>About the Kavirayar belonging to the Cholza clan.......</p>
<p>The Cholzas have a legendary history from the dim past.<br />Manunidhi Cholzan, Sibi, and some others have a remote past.<br />During the third Sangam, we come across Karikalan,<br />NalangiLLi, NalangiLLi, an several others. Karikaalan's many<br />descendants started several royal dynasties in India and South<br />East Asia.<br />They were dormant for 600 years. We come across<br />KopperunchOlzan, and the father of Mangayarkkarasi wife of<br />NerumARa Pandyan, and a few others.</p>
<p>The Cholzas were under the Pallavas. In the frequent wars<br />waged by the Pallavas and the Pandyas, the Cholzas took sides.<br />Then when both the overlords wore themselves out, the Cholzas<br />took over from the Pallavas. Then they overcame the Pandyas<br />and conquered a large territory. Thus the Imperial Cholzas came<br />into being. RajaRaja and Rajendra belong to this line.</p>
<p>In 1216, Maravaraman Sundara Pandya I over-ran the<br />Chola Empire during the rule of Kuloththunga III. Soon after<br />the defeat, Kuloththunga died. His son RajaRaja III came to<br />the throne. But during the war, he was imprisoned by his own<br />feudatory, Kopperunjingga of Thirukkovaluur.<br />Due to the intervention of the Hoysala emperor of<br />Mysore, who happened to be RajaRaja's father-in-law,<br />MS Pandya gave back the Chola Mandala to RajaRaja III.<br />But something happened. So MS Pandya attacked again in<br />1246. Soon after that MSPandya died and two kings came<br />to power in quick succession. They were weak. The Hoysala<br />NaraSimha made use of this opportunity because by this time<br />he had become the father-in-law of Maravarman Sundara<br />Pandya II also. So he extended his territory from Mysore<br />right across Coimbatore, Dindigal, and Tiruchi where he built<br />a huge fortress at Samayapuram.<br />Thus he craeted a Hoysala wedge in Tamilnadu,<br />effectively separating the Cholzas in the north and the<br />Pandyas in the south.</p>
<p>The last Chola emperor belonging to the Imperial Cholas<br />was Rajendra III. He came to the throne in 1256 A.D. He was<br />the son of RajaRaja III.</p>
<p>He defeated MS Pandya II in a war. But the Hoysala<br />took the Pandiyan side this time, to prevent a revival of<br />Cholziyan Imperialism. But Jatavarman Sundara Pandya, the<br />greatest conqueror among the later Pandyas came to power<br />in 1251.</p>
<p>He started on an expansionist policy and conquered Chera,<br />Chola,Ceylon and the Telugu Choda territories and also got rid<br />of the Hoysalas.</p>
<p>But JS Pandya died in 1268 and was succeeded by<br />Maravarman Kulasekhara Pandya, the last of the Grand Pandyas.</p>

But this<br />grand alliance was totally defeated by MKPandya.<br />This war took place in 1279.<br />And that is the last that we hear of Rajendra III and<br />the Cholas.<br />There is a group of people belonging to a particular<br />community.

Im also of the opinion RRC is the ONLY person in that<br />  koottam who had the skill and intellect to pull of such a deed and he knew<br />  he could get away with it.<br />  We have all been brainwashed by Kalki to imagine RRC as a saint but there<br />  was no way he could have been like that and ruled that big an empire. He had<br />  to be ruthless and ambitious. There was no way he could become "Raja Raja"<br />  with AK still alive. AK would have become an even bigger conqueror if he had<br />  been alive. Of all the motives RRC's and Nandhini's seem the most probable.<br />  But Nandhini was present when AK was murdered and she is not that stupid!!<br />  That eliminates her. By the process of elimination RRC is the culprit.<br />  Mr.SPS referred a book which talks about this subject and has been virtually<br />  thrashed by historians.<br />  I think RRC as a murderer warrants a separate thread atleast in this group.<br />  This should be done atleast to eliminate him from future suspicions.<br />  There is no evidence on how AK was murdered so i dont think we can eliminate<br />  RRC.</rahul.dhinakaran@gmail.com></p>

<p>  Of course, this directly contradicts the picture of RRC as portrayed by<br />  Kalki. But, is it<br />  plausible? Kalki also portrays him as an ambitious young prince, who is<br />  shrewd and who could have<br />  pulled off something like the plot above.</p>
<p>  What do others think?</p>

<p>        1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's<br />        portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola rule<br />      under<br />        Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the<br />    udayakudi<br />        inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so they<br />      were<br />        mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>        2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - he<br />    did<br />        not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his<br />    15<br />        years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the<br />    kingdom<br />        was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT as<br />        generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a lot of<br />      brick<br />        temples to stone n other related endowments( would have<br />  provided<br />        lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government<br />    was<br />        responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression.<br />    If<br />        the government increases its spending, then the citizens are<br />        encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation.<br />        People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb<br />    back<br />      up<br />        to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne after<br />    15<br />        years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes<br />    to<br />      PS<br />        line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved<br />        something...or was it a compromise formula reached between PS<br />    and<br />        Uttama.</p>
<p>        3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - short<br />        tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai<br />        manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have<br />  no<br />        love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his<br />    horoscope).</p>
<p>        Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but<br />        maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS will be<br />      next<br />        in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back<br />      when<br />        PS came on....</p>
<p>        my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the<br />        services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th<br />      year<br />        of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were royality,<br />    he<br />        was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to<br />      him -<br />        we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice<br />    then) ...<br />        after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>        but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding<br />    witch -<br />        with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these and<br />        infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific<br />        reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>

        <p>Hi all</p>
<p>All said and done, I dont believe <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  could have committed such heinous crime of killing his own brother. I do not believe Sembian Madevi would have done so too.</p>
<p>Pandiya or Pallava angle cannot be dismissed. I have always been suspicious of Pallava parthibendra.</p>

<p>Super conspiracy theory. Ive already bought this up and this theory has been trashed by this group. Im also of the opinion <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is the ONLY person in that koottam who had the skill and intellect to pull of such a deed and he knew he could get away with it. <br />We have all been brainwashed by Kalki to imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  as a saint but there was no way he could have been like that and ruled that big an empire. He had to be ruthless and ambitious. There was no way he could become "Raja Raja" with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym still alive. <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym would have become an even bigger conqueror if he had been alive. Of all the motives <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's and Nandhini's seem the most probable. But Nandhini was present when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was murdered and she is not that stupid!! That eliminates her. By the process of elimination <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is the culprit. Mr.SPS referred a book which talks about this subject and has been virtually thrashed by historians. <br />I think <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  as a murderer warrants a separate thread atleast in this group. This should be done atleast to eliminate him from future suspicions. <br />There is no evidence on how <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was murdered so i dont think we can eliminate <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>welcome - further reading Udayar portrays Sembian Madevi as dying <br />just as <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  does Boomi pooja for the big temple ---as already <br />discussed based on this she died between <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ascending the throne <br />984 and 989 ( <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  ascension 1014 - approx 26 years for building big <br />temple)....it think there are more evidences of her surviving till <br />atleast 1000-1001. quoting sps ...Sembian Madevi constructed <br />Thiruvakkarai temple and the Vakkarakali is<br />dated around 1001 AD...</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>regarding her husband - Gandaraditya - he was also known as <br />Merkelundarulina devar - read on....</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freehomepages.com/tamil-arts/volume2/articles/jain-" title="http://www.freehomepages.com/tamil-arts/volume2/articles/jain-">http://www.freehomepages.com/tamil-arts/volume2/articles/jain-</a><br />temple.html</p>
<p>The Gangas of Talakkadu were great patrons of Jainism. One of the <br />Ganga rulers with the title Prithvipati II was a contemporary of <br />Parantaka Chola I. He figures in a copper plate of Parantaka Chola <br />dated 931 CE. He also had the title Hastimalla. It is not unlikely <br />he obtained the name Hastimalla from the Jaina acarya who also had <br />the title Hastimalla. The Jaina acarya Hastimalla had a son named <br />Prati-vadi-malla who figures as the last Acharya of the first part <br />of the text Pratishta tilaka. The two Acaryas Hastimalla and Prati-<br />vadi-malla were contemporaries of Parantaka Chola I. The next acarya <br />mentioned by Nemicandra is Lokapalacarya. He must have been a <br />contemporary of Parantaka‚Äôs son.</p>
<p>This information is corroborated by inscription in an extraordinary <br />manner. Parantaka‚Äôs son Gandaraditya is mentioned in inscriptions <br />as "The Chola who went to the West". He was celebrated as Sivajnana-<br />cemmal a great Siva bhakta and one of the sacred hymns Thiruvisaippa <br />was sung by him. An inscription from Jambai in North Arcot district <br />is of interest in this regard. Gandaraditya‚Äôs queen was the famous <br />Sembiyan mahadevi who renovated many Siva temples and consecrated <br />several Bronze images of exquisite beauty. Thus Gandaraditya was <br />known in the Saiva school as a great Saivite. However his title One <br />who went to the West is not explained though occurs often. As Jain <br />palli named Gandarditya perum Palli is mentioned it is not unlikely <br />he leaned towards Jainism at certain stage of his life. The <br />inscription reference to " One who went to the West" is confirmed by <br />this text which says that the Chola king went to the West with the <br />Jain teacher, Loka-pala-acarya. It was not known that what the term <br />meant. It is seen from this text that the west is mentioned as West <br />that is "Karnata desa". It is thus clear that Loka-pala-acarya went <br />to Karnata desa with Gandarditya Chola that is in the middle of the <br />10th cent</p>
<p>....the whole dynasty seem bent in contriving situations to perplex <br />later historians...</p>

<p>  thanks to gokul, went back to KAN and read through - though we can <br />  argue on this - KAN was totally for the idea -that Uttama got rid <br />of <br />  AK he quotes the following inscription (the choice of words may <br />  throw light ( along with the prev facts -ie that the acts of <br />treason <br />  of ravidasan and co)</p>
<p>  read from pages 157 onwards...</p>
<p>  quote</p>
<p>  udayarkudi inscriptions, plates say</p>
<p>  "Aditya disappeared owing to his desire to see heaven. though his <br />  subjects, with a view to dispel the blinding darkness caused by <br />the <br />  powerful kali ( sin), entreated arulmolivarma, he, versed in the <br />  dharma of the ksattra, did not desire the kingdom for himself even <br />  inwardly as long as his paternal uncle coveted his ( ie <br />  arulmolivarma's ) country"</p>
<p>  Lovely usage of the words - desire ( while he talks of RRC) and <br />  covet ( when its with UC). also delicate use of the words 'even <br />  inwardly'</p>
<p>  further KAn writes</p>
<p>  pg 159</p>
<p>  If this reading of the story of Uttama colas accession is correct, <br />  UC furnishes an instance, by no means unique in history, of <br />selfish <br />  and perverse offspring born of parents distinguished for piety and <br />  right mindedness, and his rash and bloody self seeking stands out <br />in <br />  striking contrast to the true nobility and statesmanship of the <br />  future rajaraja</p>
<p>  How KAN writes these need to be studied but refer the reference to <br />  UC's parents - parents distinguished for piety and right <br />mindedness -<br />  kind of clears sembian madevi ( contrary to what is portrayed in <br />  Udayar) and in tune with Kalki's characteristation of sembian <br />  madevi...</p>

<p>      "Vijay Kumar .S" wrote:<br />      we have shreaded the pages bare by discussions on AK's <br />    assasination -<br />      but again many people could have benefitted from this deed - <br />      nandhini is out as she is pure fiction leaving</p>
<p>      1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's <br />      portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola rule <br />    under <br />      Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the <br />  udayakudi <br />      inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so <br />they <br />    were <br />      mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>      2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - he <br />  did <br />      not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his <br />  15 <br />      years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the <br />  kingdom <br />      was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT as <br />      generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a lot of <br />    brick <br />      temples to stone n other related endowments( would have <br />provided <br />      lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government <br />  was <br />      responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression. <br />  If <br />      the government increases its spending, then the citizens are <br />      encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation. <br />      People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb <br />  back <br />    up <br />      to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne <br />after <br />  15 <br />      years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes <br />  to <br />    PS <br />      line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved <br />      something...or was it a compromise formula reached between PS <br />  and <br />      Uttama.</p>
<p>      3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - short <br />      tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai <br />      manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have <br />no <br />      love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his <br />  horoscope). </p>
<p>      Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, <br />but <br />      maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS will <br />be <br />    next <br />      in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back <br />    when <br />      PS came on....</p>
<p>      my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the <br />      services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the <br />15th <br />    year <br />      of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were <br />royality, <br />  he <br />      was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to <br />    him - <br />      we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice <br />  then) ... <br />      after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>      but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding <br />  witch - <br />      with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these and <br />      infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific <br />      reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>

<p>Very true - seems to be the case with most ruthless warriors...</p>
<p>read this about genghis khan's death...</p>
<p>On August 18, 1227, during his last campaign against the coalition <br />of Jin Dynasty and Western Xia, Genghis Khan died. The reason for <br />his death is uncertain. The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle alleges he <br />was killed by the Tanguts. There are persistent folktales that a <br />Tangut princess, to avenge her people and prevent her rape, <br />castrated him with a knife hidden inside her and that he never <br />recovered. However other speculations for his death are that he <br />fell off his horse, due to old age and physical fatigue; some <br />contemporary observers cited prophecies from his opponents</p>

        <p>I think <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  assumed the title of Madurantakan to denote that he was the terminator of Pandyas(Madurai).</p>
<p>"Vijay Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@yahoo.com.sg  wrote: hi,</p>
<p>please refer previous posts on ephigraphical evidences - RRC was a <br />popular prince, the throne was served to him on a plate - but he let <br />go - and their reading - especially of KAN. However keeping aside <br />these, the options are</p>
<p>1. RRC consipires and kills AK - however, this argument is weak- <br />since it would have been much easy for him to put the blame of UC, <br />Ravidasan and co then and there - no tv, internet email then - he <br />could have ensured swift execution, a few tom tommers annoucing to <br />the public and that would have been it - why wait for 15 years</p>
<p>2. assume RRC and UC - are heading the two groups. both collude and <br />bump AK. Both groups equally pitted - so inorder not to split the <br />kingdom, RRC agrees to step aside with a compromise formula - that <br />he will rule after Uc. But then the flaw is - UC would have gained <br />more power during 15 years of rule and also RRC was away on so many <br />battles - a 15 year time frame is too large for those days.. so why <br />didnt UC blood line not follow him and why RRc was allowed to come <br />to power after UC. ( again matter of contention - as Madurantaka - <br />said be he son of Uc and held important adminstrative positions in <br />RRC rule, is he the son on UC) - refer prev threads in the group on <br />this.</p>
<p>3. assume UC bumped of AK. his faction more powerful than RRC - so <br />RRc gives way, saying let bygones be bygones - lets not wash dirty <br />linen in public - you rule, but after you i will be in - again weak <br />argument on the succession issue. Uc ruled well - general peace and <br />prosperity, temple building etc - must have got enough good will <br />among the masses to ensure his lineage ruled. also could have made <br />sure RRC fades away into insignificane. </p>
<p>4. Assume none knew who bumped off AK -UC and RRC both vie for the <br />throne - both faction equally matched. hence rrc steps aside and <br />since he thought it was pandya abuthivigal and goes after them. in <br />between - RRC uncovers the plot that Uc and gang did it - UC is <br />served an ultimatum, his family disowns him, but he is allowed to <br />keep his honor intact - asked to accquit the throne and go away ( or <br />bumped off). RRc assumes power and nails the rest of the <br />conspirators.</p>
<p>there is another twist to this plot, which KAN seems to have <br />ignored - RJC takes the coronation name of Madurantakan II, why <br />would he do it - ie take the tranished name of the man who killed <br />his own uncle.</p>
<p>5. Ravidasan and gang polish of AK on behalf of pandiyan. UC and RRc <br />both innocent. however, none of the assasins are caught. Kundavai <br />and Anirudhar fear for the life of RRC under these circumstances - <br />hence put up UC to the throne - while RRC moves around freely and <br />cleans up the country. find who the conspirators are - once they <br />are exposed, he comes to power sending off UC to his pilgrimage and <br />irai pani - gets the throne and convicts the gang..</p>

<blockquote><p>  I'm very sure the following hypothesis would have been discussed <br />here<br />  before:<br />  could RRC have been involved in the plot to assassinate AK? He had<br />  everything to<br />  gain from the murder. He could get a good name by <br />appointing/letting others<br />  appoint Uttama, thereby diverting attention from him. RRC also <br />knew that<br />  Uttama<br />  would be a puppet king and he could have all the control he <br />wanted. Later<br />  on, when RRC<br />  came to power, he punished a few suspicious characters like <br />Ravidasan.</p>
<p>  Of course, this directly contradicts the picture of RRC as <br />portrayed by<br />  Kalki. But, is it<br />  plausible? Kalki also portrays him as an ambitious young prince, <br />who is<br />  shrewd and who could have<br />  pulled off something like the plot above.</p>
<p>  What do others think?</p>

<p>    So Rajaraja like to close this chapter without the knowledge of<br />    others.If he published those information,he may thought it will <br />be a<br />    blackmark of cholas.

<p>          1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's<br />          portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola <br />rule<br />        under<br />          Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the<br />      udayakudi<br />          inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so <br />they<br />        were<br />          mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>          2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - <br />he<br />      did<br />          not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in <br />his<br />      15<br />          years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the<br />      kingdom<br />          was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT <br />as<br />          generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a <br />lot of<br />        brick<br />          temples to stone n other related endowments( would have<br />    provided<br />          lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the <br />government<br />      was<br />          responsible for helping to pull a country out of a <br />depression.<br />      If<br />          the government increases its spending, then the citizens <br />are<br />          encouraged to spend more because more money is in <br />circulation.<br />          People will start to invest more, and the economy will <br />climb<br />      back<br />        up<br />          to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne <br />after<br />      15<br />          years - his descendants are not given the throne and it <br />passes<br />      to<br />        PS<br />          line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved<br />          something...or was it a compromise formula reached between <br />PS<br />      and<br />          Uttama.</p>
<p>          3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - <br />short<br />          tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that <br />kundavai<br />          manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to <br />have<br />    no<br />          love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his<br />      horoscope).</p>
<p>          Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the <br />plot, but<br />          maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS <br />will be<br />        next<br />          in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came <br />back<br />        when<br />          PS came on....</p>
<p>          my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using <br />the<br />          services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the <br />15th<br />        year<br />          of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were <br />royality,<br />      he<br />          was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly <br />happened to<br />        him -<br />          we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice<br />      then) ...<br />          after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>          but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding<br />      witch -<br />          with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these <br />and<br />          infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific<br />          reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>

        <p>Continuing from prev posts - one more possibility</p>
<p>nandhini is pure fiction - so discount her. The person who best fits <br />your description of a power hungry, manipulator in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is Kundavai </p>
<p>- she never wanted to let go of her 'chola' roots - meaning get <br />married to an other clan </p>
<p>- <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  adores her and does what she bids - but not so with AK. </p>
<p>- She picks someone who is no way her equal ( in terms of status) <br />why?</p>
<p>- possibly manipulates <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  to do her bidding.</p>
<p>- kundavai bumps off AK, knowing she could manipulate <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ( taking a <br />tamil serial kind of thinking strain - even possibly <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  comes to <br />know, so she is forced to marry him. afterall it is said that the <br />vanar kulam sides with those in power. refering to prof Jb's note <br />that they served the pandyas once the chola power vanned.)</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>- Its stated that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  epitomised Rama - so inorder to atone for his <br />sins he goes on a self imposed exile - gives up power to UC.</acronym></p>
<p>- builds the big temple to appease the lord of his sins???</p>

He had<br />  to be ruthless and ambitious. There was no way he could <br />become "Raja Raja"<br />  with AK still alive. AK would have become an even bigger conqueror <br />if he had<br />  been alive. Of all the motives RRC's and Nandhini's seem the most <br />probable.<br />  But Nandhini was present when AK was murdered and she is not that <br />stupid!!<br />  That eliminates her. By the process of elimination RRC is the <br />culprit.<br />  Mr.SPS referred a book which talks about this subject and has been <br />virtually<br />  thrashed by historians.<br />  I think RRC as a murderer warrants a separate thread atleast in <br />this group.<br />  This should be done atleast to eliminate him from future <br />suspicions.<br />  There is no evidence on how AK was murdered so i dont think we can <br />eliminate<br />  RRC.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>hi,</p>
<p>please refer previous posts on ephigraphical evidences - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was a <br />popular prince, the throne was served to him on a plate - but he let <br />go - and their reading - especially of <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym . However keeping aside <br />these, the options are</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>1. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  consipires and kills AK - however, this argument is weak- <br />since it would have been much easy for him to put the blame of UC, <br />Ravidasan and co then and there - no tv, internet email then - he <br />could have ensured swift execution, a few tom tommers annoucing to <br />the public and that would have been it - why wait for 15 years</acronym></p>
<p>2. assume <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and UC - are heading the two groups. both collude and <br />bump AK. Both groups equally pitted - so inorder not to split the <br />kingdom, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  agrees to step aside with a compromise formula - that <br />he will rule after Uc. But then the flaw is - UC would have gained <br />more power during 15 years of rule and also <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was away on so many <br />battles - a 15 year time frame is too large for those days.. so why <br />didnt UC blood line not follow him and why <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was allowed to come <br />to power after UC. ( again matter of contention - as Madurantaka - <br />said be he son of Uc and held important adminstrative positions in <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  rule, is he the son on UC) - refer prev threads in the group on <br />this.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>3. assume UC bumped of AK. his faction more powerful than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  - so <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  gives way, saying let bygones be bygones - lets not wash dirty <br />linen in public - you rule, but after you i will be in - again weak <br />argument on the succession issue. Uc ruled well - general peace and <br />prosperity, temple building etc - must have got enough good will <br />among the masses to ensure his lineage ruled. also could have made <br />sure <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  fades away into insignificane. </p>
<p>4. Assume none knew who bumped off AK -UC and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  both vie for the <br />throne - both faction equally matched. hence <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  steps aside and <br />since he thought it was pandya abuthivigal and goes after them. in <br />between - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  uncovers the plot that Uc and gang did it - UC is <br />served an ultimatum, his family disowns him, but he is allowed to <br />keep his honor intact - asked to accquit the throne and go away ( or <br />bumped off). <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  assumes power and nails the rest of the <br />conspirators.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>there is another twist to this plot, which <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  seems to have <br />ignored - <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  takes the coronation name of Madurantakan II, why <br />would he do it - ie take the tranished name of the man who killed <br />his own uncle.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>5. Ravidasan and gang polish of <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym on behalf of pandiyan. UC and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  <br />both innocent. however, none of the assasins are caught. Kundavai <br />and Anirudhar fear for the life of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  under these circumstances - <br />hence put up UC to the throne - while <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  moves around freely and <br />cleans up the country. find who the conspirators are - once they <br />are exposed, he comes to power sending off UC to his pilgrimage and <br />irai pani - gets the throne and convicts the gang..</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  I'm very sure the following hypothesis would have been discussed <br />here<br />  before:<br />  could RRC have been involved in the plot to assassinate AK?

RRC also <br />knew that<br />  Uttama<br />  would be a puppet king and he could have all the control he <br />wanted.

<p>  Of course, this directly contradicts the picture of RRC as <br />portrayed by<br />  Kalki. But, is it<br />  plausible? Kalki also portrays him as an ambitious young prince, <br />who is<br />  shrewd and who could have<br />  pulled off something like the plot above.</p>

<p>          1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's<br />          portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola <br />rule<br />        under<br />          Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the<br />      udayakudi<br />          inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so <br />they<br />        were<br />          mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>          2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - <br />he<br />      did<br />          not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in <br />his<br />      15<br />          years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the<br />      kingdom<br />          was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT <br />as<br />          generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a <br />lot of<br />        brick<br />          temples to stone n other related endowments( would have<br />    provided<br />          lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the <br />government<br />      was<br />          responsible for helping to pull a country out of a <br />depression.<br />      If<br />          the government increases its spending, then the citizens <br />are<br />          encouraged to spend more because more money is in <br />circulation.<br />          People will start to invest more, and the economy will <br />climb<br />      back<br />        up<br />          to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne <br />after<br />      15<br />          years - his descendants are not given the throne and it <br />passes<br />      to<br />        PS<br />          line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved<br />          something...or was it a compromise formula reached between <br />PS<br />      and<br />          Uttama.</p>
<p>          3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - <br />short<br />          tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that <br />kundavai<br />          manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to <br />have<br />    no<br />          love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his<br />      horoscope).</p>
<p>          Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the <br />plot, but<br />          maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS <br />will be<br />        next<br />          in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came <br />back<br />        when<br />          PS came on....</p>
<p>          my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using <br />the<br />          services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the <br />15th<br />        year<br />          of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were <br />royality,<br />      he<br />          was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly <br />happened to<br />        him -<br />          we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice<br />      then) ...<br />          after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>          but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding<br />      witch -<br />          with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these <br />and<br />          infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific<br />          reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>

        <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I think the flaw in the theory is the process of elimination. If he<br />had everything to gain<br />why wait for 15 years, it is not 1 or 2. Nobody could foresee a period<br />15 years. And<br />he has also led many war campaign where you could never tell you are<br />going to come<br />alive. If he had conspired why risk his life in the war for 15 years,<br />he could have become<br />directly become the king.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is nothing here to prove that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  has not involved in the<br />murder, just to<br />state the contradiction in the argument.</acronym></p>

<p>  Hi Madhu;  <br />  Super conspiracy theory. Ive already bought this up and this theory has been trashed by this group. Im also of the opinion RRC is the ONLY person in that koottam who had the skill and intellect to pull of such a deed and he knew he could get away with it.<br />  We have all been brainwashed by Kalki to imagine RRC as a saint but there was no way he could have been like that and ruled that big an empire. He had to be ruthless and ambitious. There was no way he could become "Raja Raja" with AK still alive. AK would have become an even bigger conqueror if he had been alive. Of all the motives RRC's and Nandhini's seem the most probable. But Nandhini was present when AK was murdered and she is not that stupid!! That eliminates her. By the process of elimination RRC is the culprit. Mr.SPS referred a book which talks about this subject and has been virtually thrashed by historians.<br />  I think RRC as a murderer warrants a separate thread atleast in this group. This should be done atleast to eliminate him from future suspicions.<br />  There is no evidence on how AK was murdered so i dont think we can eliminate RRC.</p>

<p>    I'm very sure the following hypothesis would have been discussed here before:<br />    could RRC have been involved in the plot to assassinate AK? He had everything to<br />    gain from the murder. He could get a good name by appointing/letting others<br />    appoint Uttama, thereby diverting attention from him. RRC also knew that Uttama<br />    would be a puppet king and he could have all the control he wanted. Later on, when RRC<br />    came to power, he punished a few suspicious characters like Ravidasan.</p>

        <p>Hi Madhu;</p>
<p>Super conspiracy theory. Ive already bought this up and this theory has been<br />trashed by this group. Im also of the opinion <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is the ONLY person in that<br />koottam who had the skill and intellect to pull of such a deed and he knew<br />he could get away with it.<br />We have all been brainwashed by Kalki to imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  as a saint but there<br />was no way he could have been like that and ruled that big an empire. He had<br />to be ruthless and ambitious. There was no way he could become "Raja Raja"<br />with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym still alive. <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym would have become an even bigger conqueror if he had<br />been alive. Of all the motives <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's and Nandhini's seem the most probable.<br />But Nandhini was present when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was murdered and she is not that stupid!!<br />That eliminates her. By the process of elimination <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is the culprit.<br />Mr.SPS referred a book which talks about this subject and has been virtually<br />thrashed by historians.<br />I think <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  as a murderer warrants a separate thread atleast in this group.<br />This should be done atleast to eliminate him from future suspicions.<br />There is no evidence on how <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was murdered so i dont think we can eliminate<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .</p>

<p>  Of course, this directly contradicts the picture of RRC as portrayed by<br />  Kalki. But, is it<br />  plausible? Kalki also portrays him as an ambitious young prince, who is<br />  shrewd and who could have<br />  pulled off something like the plot above.</p>

<p>          1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's<br />          portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola rule<br />        under<br />          Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the<br />      udayakudi<br />          inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so they<br />        were<br />          mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>          2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - he<br />      did<br />          not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his<br />      15<br />          years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the<br />      kingdom<br />          was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT as<br />          generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a lot of<br />        brick<br />          temples to stone n other related endowments( would have<br />    provided<br />          lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government<br />      was<br />          responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression.<br />      If<br />          the government increases its spending, then the citizens are<br />          encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation.<br />          People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb<br />      back<br />        up<br />          to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne after<br />      15<br />          years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes<br />      to<br />        PS<br />          line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved<br />          something...or was it a compromise formula reached between PS<br />      and<br />          Uttama.</p>
<p>          3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - short<br />          tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai<br />          manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have<br />    no<br />          love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his<br />      horoscope).</p>
<p>          Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but<br />          maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS will be<br />        next<br />          in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back<br />        when<br />          PS came on....</p>
<p>          my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the<br />          services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th<br />        year<br />          of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were royality,<br />      he<br />          was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to<br />        him -<br />          we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice<br />      then) ...<br />          after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>          but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding<br />      witch -<br />          with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these and<br />          infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific<br />          reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>

<p>        1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's<br />        portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola rule<br />      under<br />        Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the<br />    udayakudi<br />        inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so they<br />      were<br />        mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>        2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - he<br />    did<br />        not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his<br />    15<br />        years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the<br />    kingdom<br />        was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT as<br />        generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a lot of<br />      brick<br />        temples to stone n other related endowments( would have<br />  provided<br />        lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government<br />    was<br />        responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression.<br />    If<br />        the government increases its spending, then the citizens are<br />        encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation.<br />        People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb<br />    back<br />      up<br />        to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne after<br />    15<br />        years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes<br />    to<br />      PS<br />        line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved<br />        something...or was it a compromise formula reached between PS<br />    and<br />        Uttama.</p>
<p>        3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - short<br />        tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai<br />        manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have<br />  no<br />        love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his<br />    horoscope).</p>
<p>        Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but<br />        maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS will be<br />      next<br />        in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back<br />      when<br />        PS came on....</p>
<p>        my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the<br />        services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th<br />      year<br />        of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were royality,<br />    he<br />        was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to<br />      him -<br />        we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice<br />    then) ...<br />        after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>        but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding<br />    witch -<br />        with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these and<br />        infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific<br />        reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>

<p>    1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's <br />    portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola rule <br />  under <br />    Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the <br />udayakudi <br />    inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so they <br />  were <br />    mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>    2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - he <br />did <br />    not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his <br />15 <br />    years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the <br />kingdom <br />    was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT as <br />    generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a lot of <br />  brick <br />    temples to stone n other related endowments( would have provided <br />    lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government <br />was <br />    responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression. <br />If <br />    the government increases its spending, then the citizens are <br />    encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation. <br />    People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb <br />back <br />  up <br />    to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne after <br />15 <br />    years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes <br />to <br />  PS <br />    line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved <br />    something...or was it a compromise formula reached between PS <br />and <br />    Uttama.</p>
<p>    3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - short <br />    tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai <br />    manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have no <br />    love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his <br />horoscope). </p>
<p>    Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but <br />    maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS will be <br />  next <br />    in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back <br />  when <br />    PS came on....</p>
<p>    my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the <br />    services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th <br />  year <br />    of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were royality, <br />he <br />    was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to <br />  him - <br />    we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice <br />then) ... <br />    after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>    but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding <br />witch - <br />    with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these and <br />    infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific <br />    reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>

        <p>Recently i had the good fortune of attending a seminar of Mr. Robin <br />sharma ( author of the international acclaimed Monk who sold his <br />Ferrari) - its another story that i first need to know how to get the <br />ferrari.</p>
<p>But one of the few things he said was profound - he calls himself a <br />professional distruber - in this role he does meet with quite a few <br />top CEO's - he says he asks not to see their collection of Rolls <br />royces, watches, antiques - but to see their library...</p>
<p>with the advent of the net, pdfs, ebooks and now podcasts - it does <br />take only a small effort to get into the habit of arivu kozhumudal..</p>

        <p>Hey,<br />Actually some important politician or one of the family members may <br />invovled in this <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym murder.Surely RajaRaja did know the truth.But not <br />everyone in that period.</acronym></p>
<p>So Rajaraja like to close this chapter without the knowledge of <br />others.If he published those information,he may thought it will be a <br />blackmark of cholas. People in that period also comes to conclusion <br />by guess only.Head of the kolaikara group might be silently punished <br />by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym .<br />This is the outer circle of the riddle.<br />Now you may guess some real characters who could get profit by Ak's <br />murder and we can filter from that.</acronym></p>

<p>      1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's <br />      portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola rule <br />    under <br />      Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the <br />  udayakudi <br />      inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so they <br />    were <br />      mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>      2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - he <br />  did <br />      not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his <br />  15 <br />      years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the <br />  kingdom <br />      was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT as <br />      generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a lot of <br />    brick <br />      temples to stone n other related endowments( would have <br />provided <br />      lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government <br />  was <br />      responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression. <br />  If <br />      the government increases its spending, then the citizens are <br />      encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation. <br />      People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb <br />  back <br />    up <br />      to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne after <br />  15 <br />      years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes <br />  to <br />    PS <br />      line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved <br />      something...or was it a compromise formula reached between PS <br />  and <br />      Uttama.</p>
<p>      3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - short <br />      tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai <br />      manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have <br />no <br />      love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his <br />  horoscope). </p>
<p>      Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but <br />      maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS will be <br />    next <br />      in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back <br />    when <br />      PS came on....</p>
<p>      my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the <br />      services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th <br />    year <br />      of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were royality, <br />  he <br />      was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to <br />    him - <br />      we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice <br />  then) ... <br />      after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>      but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding <br />  witch - <br />      with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these and <br />      infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific <br />      reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>

<p>    1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's<br />    portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola rule<br />  under<br />    Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the udayakudi<br />    inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so they<br />  were<br />    mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>    2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - he did<br />    not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his 15<br />    years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the kingdom<br />    was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT as<br />    generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a lot of<br />  brick<br />    temples to stone n other related endowments( would have provided<br />    lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government was<br />    responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression. If<br />    the government increases its spending, then the citizens are<br />    encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation.<br />    People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb back<br />  up<br />    to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne after 15<br />    years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes to<br />  PS<br />    line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved<br />    something...or was it a compromise formula reached between PS and<br />    Uttama.</p>
<p>    3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - short<br />    tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai<br />    manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have no<br />    love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his horoscope).</p>
<p>    Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but<br />    maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS will be<br />  next<br />    in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back<br />  when<br />    PS came on....</p>
<p>    my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the<br />    services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th<br />  year<br />    of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were royality, he<br />    was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to<br />  him -<br />    we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice then) ...<br />    after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>    but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding witch -<br />    with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these and<br />    infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific<br />    reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>

        <p>Thanks Vijaya Kumar for an interesting &amp; detailed analysis. Motivates me to read Nilakanta Sastri which I have been wanting to but not got around to do it .<br />SR</p>

<p>1) Pandya spies ( however we know that contrary to kalki's <br />portrayal - Ravidasan and gang held high offices in chola rule under <br />Uttama and hence cannot be called spies - more from the udayakudi <br />inscription calling them as traitors or betrayers....)- so they were <br />mere tools - objects - who hurled them !!!</p>
<p>2) Uttama/sembian madevi ( wrongfully denied the throne) - he did <br />not bring any of the ultimately convicted gang to trial in his 15 <br />years of rule. on the contrary gave them high offices. the kingdom <br />was very much flourishing under his rule ( with PS and VT as <br />generals possibly), built a lot of temples, converted a lot of brick <br />temples to stone n other related endowments( would have provided <br />lots of employment - pure Keynesian economics - the government was <br />responsible for helping to pull a country out of a depression. If <br />the government increases its spending, then the citizens are <br />encouraged to spend more because more money is in circulation. <br />People will start to invest more, and the economy will climb back up <br />to normal.) Despite all this he had to give up his throne after 15 <br />years - his descendants are not given the throne and it passes to PS <br />line.....did something happen in the 15th year that proved <br />something...or was it a compromise formula reached between PS and <br />Uttama.</p>
<p>3) PS, Kundavai, Aniruddar combine - AK was war hungry - short <br />tempered and could not be manipulated. we know that kundavai <br />manipulated PS. from kalki's portrayal Kundavai seems to have no <br />love lost for her elder brother ( she blames it on his horoscope). </p>
<p>Anirrudar - being a minister should have known of the plot, but <br />maybe he let things be, for greater good....thinking PS will be next <br />in line. afterwards when Uttama came he went off and came back when <br />PS came on....</p>
<p>my vote would go for Uttama /sembian madevi combine using the <br />services of ravidasan and co. something came up during the 15th year <br />of uc rule, which made PS take over - since they were royality, he <br />was just asked to resign and go..( or what exactly happened to him - <br />we dont hear of him at all - was there a slient justice then) ... <br />after a year PS went after the rest.</p>
<p>but again Udayar portrays Sembiyan Maadevi like a brooding witch - <br />with all the black magic etc. kalki was much against these and <br />infact in the kodikkarai episode he does provide scientific <br />reasoning behind the kollivai peei...</p>
