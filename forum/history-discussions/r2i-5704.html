<p>Just wanted to share with you all that I will be relocating to India by<br />mid-June, to Bangalore.<br />It has been a long 14 years away from home and am really looking forward to<br />it. Perhaps ,<br />in future, I can actually participate in one of the different <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym <br />meets/trips, even if I can't<br />contribute much!</acronym></p>

        <p>That is true. I am not sure statistically but the<br />majority tamils i meet outside do have working<br />knowledge of Hindi.</p>
<p>Some generalisations i have noticed and heard from<br />other people - (generalisations only not applicable to<br />each and every person)</p>
<p>1 We are very smart - 'intelligent' in the sense we<br />have fast grasp of problems, not that good at slow<br />thinking</p>
<p>2 We know several languages, hindi,marathi, french<br />german etc but have resistance towards kannada,<br />telugu, etc. </p>
<p>3 We have sharp sense of humor that often can be<br />hurtful to others, like calling bangalore 'sleepy'<br />city, telugus 'goltis' and so on in their presence and<br />not realizing it might hurt at times.</p>
<p>4 We are very liberal people, chennai possibly next to<br />bombay is the only city where so many communities live<br />and survive</p>
<p>5 The average tamil can cook much better than his<br />north indian/telugu/kannada counterparts, atleast he<br />won't starve and can definitely make coffee.</p>
<p>Just some things to think about...</p>

What<br />  you do afterdark <br />  cannot be written in this blog but can still mention<br />  that <br />  kingfisher's Balance sheet could list Blr on fixed<br />  asset sch.</p>
<p>  Whatever you do afterdark, make sure you join the<br />  long list in front <br />  of the various temples and pray profusely that God<br />  suffer from short <br />  Term memory loss a la Gajini and forgive all your<br />  jalakridai of yore.</p>
<p>  The word punctual has been long martyed - You have<br />  to be atleast 2 <br />  hours late to work, 21/2 if it's a lunch meeting, 3<br />  if its dinner <br />  and more if for any other formal occasion.</p>
<p>  All food should be consumed on road sides or in some<br />  vihars. All <br />  sambars should be blood red but still taste sweet.</p>
<p>  Tea should be sweeter than payasam and coffee should<br />  make you throw <br />  up. </p>
<p>  Houses should never be brightly lit and every inch<br />  of space must <br />  have wooden furnitute. Rest of the floor showing<br />  must be covered <br />  with the dirtiest looking carpet. Every window must<br />  have dark shades <br />  and they should never be left open.</p>
<p>  In short living in Bangalore is like living in a<br />  foreign country, <br />  with strange language and stange habits, but with<br />  horrible living <br />  standards. </p>
<p>  But you still cant take two things away from<br />  bangalore - the women <br />  and greenery. I think coversely something is<br />  genetically wrong with <br />  women in chennai and same defect has manifested into<br />  men from <br />  bangalore - they keep getting uglier.</p>

<p>  Bangalore is cosmo, more than ever now. Lots of places<br />  to eat, if you know where to go you do get good food,<br />  although pricey, shopping is nice, lot of variety, and<br />  of course if you like pubs and that type of stuff<br />  Bangalore always was like that.</p>
<p>  Safety, i would say no. Software engineers especially<br />  are target of crime now, there is lot of theft at<br />  knife point for cell phones and jewellery, and break<br />  ins in separate houses. Don't go out late, or drive in<br />  remote areas.</p>
<p>  Be careful, and any place in India is home anyway. You<br />  will sure enjoy it for that reason!!</p>

<p>    *grin* wow.. some quite scary emails there..<br />    However,. Bangalore is my<br />    favourite<br />    city in India (despite the increased pollution,<br />    traffic etc) because I<br />    believe it is the<br />    most cosmopolitan of cities. Having grown up in<br />    different places in India, I<br />    find<br />    Chennai to be too insular , delhi is rather nasty<br />    and dangerous and Mumbai<br />    lacks "culture".</p>
<p>    Bangalore to me is a happy mix.. or maybe I shall be<br />    disappointed :)</p>
<p>    Cheers,</p>

<p>      Kathy, I wish it was 'westernised' :)) meaning<br />      cleaner, more disciplined traffic and more<br />    efficient<br />      trash handling - unfortunately not.</p>
<p>      I'd rather call it 'commercialisation'. I agree<br />    things<br />      like fast food, more cars and all are aping from<br />    the<br />      west, but there is more awareness in the west now<br />    of<br />      the excessive indulgence, that will take a while<br />    to<br />      catch up in India.</p>
<p>      Bangalore was a very clean city, now it plastic,<br />      trash, everywhere. Environmental pollution was<br />    always<br />      a problem and is much worse now. One of the<br />    biggest<br />      side effects, no sparrows!! These friendly<br />    harmless<br />      little beings are everyone's companion even in<br />      concrete jungles - some pesticide was used that<br />    near<br />      eradicated them almost completely from Bangalore.<br />      Green parrots disappeared around when i was there<br />      only.</p>

        <p>I think in a strange way, we tamilians have this "complex"<br />towards the other south indian languages; the same "complex"<br />that we accuse the north indians of having towards Tamizh. That is,. we<br />think that in a strange way, it is "beneath our dignity" to learn the other<br />south indian languages and as Malathi pointed out we have no problems<br />learning hindi/marathi or any other northie language.  I believe we need to<br />work around that :)</p>
<p>having said that, my reasons for going back are not about the food<br />or the "culture" of the city.. that is incidental to the whole thing.</p>

<p>    i have nothing against bangalore - but some years<br />    ago i met a<br />    traffic cop who was particularly rude....driving a<br />    TN registration<br />    car, despite showing him ample proof that we had<br />    driven in for a<br />    meeting and were returning back - the guy insisted<br />    to fine us for<br />    not having a karnataka registration - the argument<br />    was - you want<br />    jobs from us, you want water from us but tax you<br />    want to pay in TN (<br />    these were comments of an uniformed cop) - finally<br />    he let us go when<br />    we threatened to capture what he said on the hp's<br />    video....the whole<br />    concept of vehicle tax is a joke. anyway, go this as<br />    a forward, so<br />    please reserve comments and look at just the funnier<br />    side..</p>
<p>    Time to travel from your house to your neighbor's<br />    house. (a) 2<br />    Wheeler - 4 years (b)4 Wheelers 700 Years (c) Big 4<br />    wheelers - 3752<br />    Years (d) If you plan to park - Impossible</p>
<p>    There are no roads in Bangalore. Vehicles travel in<br />    the gaps between<br />    houses. They fondly remember it as roads even though<br />    there is no<br />    trace of tar on them.</p>
<p>    Even though India has opened up itself to foreign<br />    cars every house<br />    should own a FIAT.</p>
<p>    Nobody knows the right way - so don't waste you time<br />    is asking for<br />    directions - if you still insist record this on a<br />    tape and play it -<br />    "sir, circle hogi straight madi - double road left<br />    hogi...circle -<br />    you can play it on and on."</p>
<p>    It is the only place in the world where people drive<br />    2-wheelers on<br />    pavements.</p>
<p>    Tamil isnt spoken in Bangalore - even if you know<br />    tamil, its<br />    indecent to speak in tamil. However if you still<br />    chance on someone<br />    who does - its udrango ( i/o of kelambaranga)</p>
<p>    English is the only allowed language and has to be<br />    spoken without<br />    exercising your lips muscle and Jaw bones - (eathen<br />    hunt would fail<br />    in lip reading if he came to bangalore)</p>
<p>    Jeans ( ofcourse Jean is the only botton wear<br />    allowed and is formal<br />    wear) are never to be worn above the waist - where<br />    exactly below<br />    cannot be written in this.</p>
<p>    T shirts have to be two sizes small. Shirts have to<br />    be two sizes<br />    large and checked ( export rejects from the<br />    inumerous factories<br />    suppling to GAP and NIKE) - they should never be<br />    buttoned or pressed<br />    ( ironed).</p>
<p>    Irrespective of the occasion you have dirty sneaker<br />    and never mind<br />    the weather ( bangalore has lost its cool weather<br />    long back )<br />    changes - you always need to wear a blazer or wind<br />    cheater. If its<br />    too smelly just tie it around the waist.</p>
<p>    Commercial establishments are open 4 hours a day.<br />    They also break<br />    for lunch for 4 hours.</p>
<p>    Any building with a glass façade is into IT or BPO<br />    and will pay you<br />    five times of what you would get in any of the other<br />    buildings ( not<br />    that any work gets done in them either)</p>
<p>    Every other road has a medical college and two<br />    engineering colleges<br />    ( plus one cinema hall) - it goes wihtout mention<br />    that the cinema<br />    hall has better attendance for a show that the<br />    colleges get per<br />    semester.</p>
<p>    If dracula were to resettle I think he would pick<br />    bangalore - the<br />    rule is for every hour you stay awake when the sun<br />    is up, you need<br />    to stay up for 5 times that many in the night. What<br />    you do afterdark<br />    cannot be written in this blog but can still mention<br />    that<br />    kingfisher's Balance sheet could list Blr on fixed<br />    asset sch.</p>
<p>    Whatever you do afterdark, make sure you join the<br />    long list in front<br />    of the various temples and pray profusely that God<br />    suffer from short<br />    Term memory loss a la Gajini and forgive all your<br />    jalakridai of yore.</p>
<p>    The word punctual has been long martyed - You have<br />    to be atleast 2<br />    hours late to work, 21/2 if it's a lunch meeting, 3<br />    if its dinner<br />    and more if for any other formal occasion.</p>
<p>    All food should be consumed on road sides or in some<br />    vihars. All<br />    sambars should be blood red but still taste sweet.</p>
<p>    Tea should be sweeter than payasam and coffee should<br />    make you throw<br />    up.</p>
<p>    Houses should never be brightly lit and every inch<br />    of space must<br />    have wooden furnitute. Rest of the floor showing<br />    must be covered<br />    with the dirtiest looking carpet. Every window must<br />    have dark shades<br />    and they should never be left open.</p>
<p>    In short living in Bangalore is like living in a<br />    foreign country,<br />    with strange language and stange habits, but with<br />    horrible living<br />    standards.</p>
<p>    But you still cant take two things away from<br />    bangalore - the women<br />    and greenery. I think coversely something is<br />    genetically wrong with<br />    women in chennai and same defect has manifested into<br />    men from<br />    bangalore - they keep getting uglier.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>i have nothing against bangalore - but some years ago i met a <br />traffic cop who was particularly rude....driving a TN registration <br />car, despite showing him ample proof that we had driven in for a <br />meeting and were returning back - the guy insisted to fine us for <br />not having a karnataka registration - the argument was - you want <br />jobs from us, you want water from us but tax you want to pay in TN ( <br />these were comments of an uniformed cop) - finally he let us go when <br />we threatened to capture what he said on the hp's video....the whole <br />concept of vehicle tax is a joke. anyway, go this as a forward, so <br />please reserve comments and look at just the funnier side..</p>
<blockquote><p>Time to travel from your house to your neighbor's house. (a) 2 </p></blockquote>
<p>Wheeler - 4 years (b)4 Wheelers 700 Years (c) Big 4 wheelers - 3752 <br />Years (d) If you plan to park - Impossible</p>
<p>There are no roads in Bangalore. Vehicles travel in the gaps between <br />houses. They fondly remember it as roads even though there is no <br />trace of tar on them.</p>
<p>Even though India has opened up itself to foreign cars every house <br />should own a FIAT. </p>
<p>Nobody knows the right way - so don't waste you time is asking for <br />directions - if you still insist record this on a tape and play it -<br />"sir, circle hogi straight madi - double road left hogi...circle - <br />you can play it on and on."</p>
<p>It is the only place in the world where people drive 2-wheelers on <br />pavements. </p>
<p>Tamil isnt spoken in Bangalore - even if you know tamil, its <br />indecent to speak in tamil. However if you still chance on someone <br />who does - its udrango ( i/o of kelambaranga)</p>
<p>English is the only allowed language and has to be spoken without <br />exercising your lips muscle and Jaw bones - (eathen hunt would fail <br />in lip reading if he came to bangalore)</p>
<p>Jeans ( ofcourse Jean is the only botton wear allowed and is formal<br />wear) are never to be worn above the waist - where exactly below <br />cannot be written in this. </p>
<p>T shirts have to be two sizes small. Shirts have to be two sizes <br />large and checked ( export rejects from the inumerous factories <br />suppling to GAP and NIKE) - they should never be buttoned or pressed <br />( ironed). </p>
<p>Irrespective of the occasion you have dirty sneaker and never mind <br />the weather ( bangalore has lost its cool weather long back ) <br />changes - you always need to wear a blazer or wind cheater. If its <br />too smelly just tie it around the waist.</p>
<p>Commercial establishments are open 4 hours a day. They also break <br />for lunch for 4 hours. </p>
<p>Any building with a glass fa?ade is into IT or BPO and will pay you <br />five times of what you would get in any of the other buildings ( not <br />that any work gets done in them either)</p>
<p>Every other road has a medical college and two engineering colleges <br />( plus one cinema hall) - it goes wihtout mention that the cinema <br />hall has better attendance for a show that the colleges get per <br />semester.</p>
<p>If dracula were to resettle I think he would pick bangalore - the <br />rule is for every hour you stay awake when the sun is up, you need <br />to stay up for 5 times that many in the night. What you do afterdark <br />cannot be written in this blog but can still mention that <br />kingfisher's Balance sheet could list Blr on fixed asset sch.</p>
<p>Whatever you do afterdark, make sure you join the long list in front <br />of the various temples and pray profusely that God suffer from short <br />Term memory loss a la Gajini and forgive all your jalakridai of yore.</p>
<p>The word punctual has been long martyed - You have to be atleast 2 <br />hours late to work, 21/2 if it's a lunch meeting, 3 if its dinner <br />and more if for any other formal occasion.</p>
<p>All food should be consumed on road sides or in some vihars. All <br />sambars should be blood red but still taste sweet.</p>
<p>Tea should be sweeter than payasam and coffee should make you throw <br />up. </p>

        <p>Hi Arun, I plan to go home sometime too, I originally<br />thought Bangalore but after a few visits I have<br />changed my mind, it will probably be Chennai. </p>
<p>Bangalore is cosmo, more than ever now. Lots of places<br />to eat, if you know where to go you do get good food,<br />although pricey, shopping is nice, lot of variety, and<br />of course if you like pubs and that type of stuff<br />Bangalore always was like that.</p>
<p>Safety, i would say no. Software engineers especially<br />are target of crime now, there is lot of theft at<br />knife point for cell phones and jewellery, and break<br />ins in separate houses. Don't go out late, or drive in<br />remote areas.</p>
<p>Be careful, and any place in India is home anyway. You<br />will sure enjoy it for that reason!!</p>

        <p>Kathy, I wish it was 'westernised' :)) meaning<br />cleaner, more disciplined traffic and more efficient<br />trash handling - unfortunately not.</p>
<p>I'd rather call it 'commercialisation'. I agree things<br />like fast food, more cars and all are aping from the<br />west, but there is more awareness in the west now of<br />the excessive indulgence, that will take a while to<br />catch up in India.</p>
<p>Bangalore was a very clean city, now it plastic,<br />trash, everywhere. Environmental pollution was always<br />a problem and is much worse now. One of the biggest<br />side effects, no sparrows!! These friendly harmless<br />little beings are everyone's companion even in<br />concrete jungles - some pesticide was used that near<br />eradicated them almost completely from Bangalore.<br />Green parrots disappeared around when i was there<br />only.</p>

        <p>Oooh Kathie you got me started. I think Sivaram<br />summarized it well. I grew up in Bangalore, lived<br />there for several years before i came here 15 years<br />ago. Even while I was growing up my father who was<br />again a Bangalore native in some ways (he was born and<br />raised in Chennai but had relatives and they used to<br />visit every summer) often went on about Bangalore of<br />old times. </p>
<p>Bangalore was by far the most green city in the south.<br />I lived in Jayanagar which is south bangalore. When I<br />went to college you only needed to glance either side<br />before crossing a road. Even if you did not look<br />motorists would stop for you. The distance from my<br />house to college was 3 miles. The road had gulmohur<br />trees on either side which grew to form a canopy and<br />offered shade during summer. The 3 mile walk was a<br />pleasure. People did not eat out as much, but what you<br />got, the native snacks and food, were relished much -<br />Bangalore by the way is famous for peanuts, hence the<br />name 'Benga luru' now which means boiled<br />beans/peanuts. You get raw peanuts to boil, you get<br />'uri kaalu' which is peanuts coated with a spicy mix<br />and fried on sand without oil, you get 'mocha avare'<br />which is a relative of lima beans, smaller and much<br />more tasty, and you get a variety of other beans<br />including double beans which are not easily available<br />in other parts of india. Now all eating is about fast<br />food - kids don't even know the pleasure of boiled<br />peanuts with salt on a late afternoon, or how great<br />uri kaalu is without the fat from oil and spicy<br />addition to peanuts. No courtesy is left in human<br />interaction any more - you only hear honking honking<br />all the time even on small roads and bylanes.</p>
<p>There was a century old tree in the campus of<br />Bangalore club. When we used to wait for the run down<br />bangalore bus system to show up, the birds on this<br />tree provided a veritable musical concert to our ears.<br />The branches were so long that the extended well over<br />four lanes of Double Road, the road that connects<br />south bangalore to heart of the city. The tree is cut<br />down to make room for what, more roads and more cars<br />again.</p>
<p>I will go on if you let me. But in reality am just<br />very saddened. Of course we need progress but progress<br />at what cost, am not sure. In Chennai the culture is<br />kept alive, to some extent, by temples and classical<br />music. Mumbai was always a business city, has its own<br />culture but not one that is dying out. Bangalore was<br />always about its trees, greenery, courteous gentle<br />people and homegrown produce. Most of it is gone now.</p>

        <p>Hi Arun, safe journey home!! 14 years is a long time ( I turned 15 <br />this year). I grew up in Bangalore and my parents still live there. <br />If you want to study change in India Bangalore is a good example, I <br />wish I could say positive change but mostly not. Anyway don't mean <br />to discourage you.</p>
<p>Keep us posted and take care,</p>
