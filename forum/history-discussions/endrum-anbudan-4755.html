<p>Hathigumpha Inscription of Kharavela of Kalinga</p>
<p>Please read line paragraph 11 and 13 for connections between tamils and kalinga during 60BC</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>(Line 1) Salutation to the Arhats (Arihats = lit. 'Conquerors of Enemies,' i.e., Jinas). Salutation to all the Siddhas. By illustrious Kharavela, the Aira (Aila), the Great King, the descendant of Mahameghavahana, the increaser (of the glory) of the Cheti (Chedi) dynasty, (endowed) with excellent and auspicious marks and features, possessed of virtues which have reached (the ends of) the four quarters, overlord of Kalinga,</p>
<p>(L. 2) for fifteen years, with a body ruddy and handsome were played youthsome sport; after that (by him who) had mastered (royal) correspondence, currency, finance, civil and religious laws (and) who had become well-versed in all (branches) of learning, for nine years (the office of) Yuvaraja (heir apparent) was administered. Having completed the twenty-fourth year, at that time, (he) who had been prosperous (vardhamana) since his infancy (?) and who (was destined) to have wide conquests as those of Vena,</p>
<p>(L. 3) then in the state of manhood, obtains the imperial (maharajya) coronation in the dynasty of Kalinga. As soon as he is anointed, in the first (regnal) year (he) causes repairs of the gates, the walls and the buildings (of the city), (which had been) damaged by storm; in the city of Kalinga (he) causes the erection of the embankments of the lake (called after) Khibira Rishi, (and) of (other) tanks and cisterns, (also) the restoration of all the gardens (he) causes to be</p>
<p>(L. 4) done at (the cost of) thirty-five-hundred-thousands, and (he) gratifies the People. And in the second year (he), disregarding Satakamini, despatches to the western regions an army strong in cavalry, elephants, infantry (nara) and chariots (ratha) and by that army having reached the Kanha-bemna, he throws the city of the Musikas into consternation. Again in the third year,</p>
<p>(L. 5) (he) versed in the science of the Gandharvas (i.e., music), entertains the capital with the exhibition of dapa, dancing, singing and instrumental music and by causing to be held festivities and assemblies (samajas); similarly in the fourth year, 'the Abode of Vidyadharas' built by the former Kalingan king(s), which had not been damaged before &#133;&#133;&#133;..................... with their coronets rendered meaningless, with their helmets (?) (bilma) cut in twain (?), and with their umbrellas and</p>
<p>(L. 6) bhingaras cast away, deprived of their jewels (i.e., ratana, Skt. ratna, precious objects) all the Rathikas and Bhojakas (he) causes to bow down at his feet. Now in the fifth year he brings into the capital from the road of Tansauliya the canal excavated in the year one hundred-and-three of King Nanda ................... ......... Having been (re-)anointed (he while) celebrating the Rajasuya, remits all tithes and cesses,</p>
<p>(L. 7) bestows many privileges (amounting to) hundreds of thousands or the City-Corporation and the Realm-Corporation. In the seventh year of his reign, his famous wife of Vajiraghara obtained the dignity of auspicious motherhood &#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.Then in the eighth year, (he) with a large army having sacked Goradhagiri</p>
<p>(L.8) causes pressure on Rajagaha (Rajagriha). On account of the loud report of this act of valour, the Yavana (Greek) King Dimi[ta] retreated to Mathura having extricated his demoralized army and transport.&#133; &#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.(He) gives&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;..with foliage</p>
<p>(L. 9) Kalpa (wish-fulfilling) trees, elephants, chariots with their drivers, houses, residences and rest-houses. And to make all these acceptable (he) gives at a fire sacrifice (?) exemption (from taxes) to the caste of Brahmanas. Of Arhat ..................................</p>
<p>(L. 10) ..................(He) causes to be built . . . . a royal residence (called) the Palace of Great Victory (Mahavijaya) at the cost of thirty-eight hundred thousands. And in the tenth year (he), following (the three-fold policy) of chastisement, alliance and conciliation sends out an expedition against Bharatavasa (and) brings about the conquest of the land (or, country) ........ and obtains jewels and precious things of the (kings) attacked.<br />(L.11) .................. And the market-town (?) Pithumda founded by the Ava King he ploughs down with a plough of asses; and (he) thoroughly breaks up the confederacy of the T[r]amira (Dramira) countries of one hundred and thirteen years, which has been a source of danger to (his) Country (Janapada). And in the twelfth year he terrifies the kings of the Utarapatha with .................. thousands of</p>
<p>(L.12) .................. And causing panic amongst the people of Magadha (he) drives (his) elephants into the Sugamgiya (Palace), and (he) makes the King of Magadha, Bahasatimita, bow at his feet. And (he) sets up (the image) 'the Jina of Kalinga' which had been taken away by King Nanda .................. and causes to be brought home the riches of Amga and Magadha along with the keepers of the family jewels <br />of ....................</p>
<p>(L. 13) .................(He) builds excellent towers with carved interiors and creates a settlement of a hundred masons, giving them exemption from land revenue. And a wonderful and marvellous enclosure of stockade for driving in the elephants (he)...... and horses, elephants, jewels and rubies as well as numerous pearls in hundreds (he) causes to be brought here from the Pandya King.</p>
<p>(L. 14) .................(he) subjugates. In the thirteenth year, on the Kumari Hill where the Wheel of Conquest had been well-revolved (i.e., the religion of Jina had been preached), (he) offers respectfully royal maintenances, China clothes (silks) and white clothes to (the monks) who (by their austerities) have extinguished the round of lives, the preachers on the religious life and conduct at the Relic Memorial. By Kharavela, the illustrious, an a layman devoted to worship, is realised (the nature of) jiva and deha</p>
<p>(L. 15) ................ bringing about a Council of the wise ascetics and sages, from hundred (i.e., all) quarters, the monks (samanas) of good deeds and who have fully followed (the injunctions) .................. near the Relic Depository of the Arhat, on the top of the hill, ............ with stones .............. brought from many miles (yojanas) quarried from excellent mines (he builds) shelters for the Sinhapatha Queen Sindhula. ................ .........................</p>
<p>(L. 16) .................Patalaka(?)&#133;&#133;&#133;(he) sets up four columns inlaid with beryl&#133;&#133;..at the cost of twenty-five hundred thousands; (he) causes to be compiled expeditiously the (text) of the seven-fold Angas of the sixty-four (letters). He is the King of Peace, the King of Prosperity, the King of Monks (bhikshus), the King of Religion (Dharma), who has been seeing, hearing and realising blessings (kalyanas)-</p>
<p>(L. 17) ................ accomplished in extraordinary virtues, respector of every sect, the repairer of all temples, one whose chariot and army are irresistible, one whose empire is protected by the chief of the empire (himself), descended from the family of the Royal Sage Vasu, the Great conqueror, the King, the illustrious Kharavela.</p>

<p>  Hathigumpha Inscription of Kharavela of Kalinga</p>
<p>  Please read line paragraph 11 and 13 for connections between <br />tamils and kalinga during 60BC</p>
<p>  ---------------------------------</p>
<p>  (Line 1) Salutation to the Arhats (Arihats = lit. 'Conquerors of <br />Enemies,' i.e., Jinas). Salutation to all the Siddhas. By illustrious </p></blockquote>
<p>Kharavela, the Aira (Aila), the Great King, the descendant of <br />Mahameghavahana, the increaser (of the glory) of the Cheti (Chedi) <br />dynasty, (endowed) with excellent and auspicious marks and features, <br />possessed of virtues which have reached (the ends of) the four <br />quarters, overlord of Kalinga,</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 2) for fifteen years, with a body ruddy and handsome <br />were played youthsome sport; after that (by him who) had mastered </p></blockquote>
<p>(royal) correspondence, currency, finance, civil and religious laws <br />(and) who had become well-versed in all (branches) of learning, for <br />nine years (the office of) Yuvaraja (heir apparent) was administered. <br />Having completed the twenty-fourth year, at that time, (he) who had <br />been prosperous (vardhamana) since his infancy (?) and who (was <br />destined) to have wide conquests as those of Vena,</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 3) then in the state of manhood, obtains the imperial <br />(maharajya) coronation in the dynasty of Kalinga. As soon as he is </p></blockquote>
<p>anointed, in the first (regnal) year (he) causes repairs of the <br />gates, the walls and the buildings (of the city), (which had been) <br />damaged by storm; in the city of Kalinga (he) causes the erection of <br />the embankments of the lake (called after) Khibira Rishi, (and) of <br />(other) tanks and cisterns, (also) the restoration of all the gardens <br />(he) causes to be</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 4) done at (the cost of) thirty-five-hundred-<br />thousands, and (he) gratifies the People. And in the second year </p></blockquote>
<p>(he), disregarding Satakamini, despatches to the western regions an <br />army strong in cavalry, elephants, infantry (nara) and chariots <br />(ratha) and by that army having reached the Kanha-bemna, he throws <br />the city of the Musikas into consternation. Again in the third year,</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 5) (he) versed in the science of the Gandharvas <br />(i.e., music), entertains the capital with the exhibition of dapa, </p></blockquote>
<p>dancing, singing and instrumental music and by causing to be held <br />festivities and assemblies (samajas); similarly in the fourth <br />year, 'the Abode of Vidyadharas' built by the former Kalingan king<br />(s), which had not been damaged before ???..................... with <br />their coronets rendered meaningless, with their helmets (?) (bilma) <br />cut in twain (?), and with their umbrellas and</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 6) bhingaras cast away, deprived of their jewels <br />(i.e., ratana, Skt. ratna, precious objects) all the Rathikas and </p></blockquote>
<p>Bhojakas (he) causes to bow down at his feet. Now in the fifth year <br />he brings into the capital from the road of Tansauliya the canal <br />excavated in the year one hundred-and-three of King <br />Nanda ................... ......... Having been (re-)anointed (he <br />while) celebrating the Rajasuya, remits all tithes and cesses,</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 7) bestows many privileges (amounting to) hundreds of <br />thousands or the City-Corporation and the Realm-Corporation. In the </p></blockquote>
<p>seventh year of his reign, his famous wife of Vajiraghara obtained <br />the dignity of auspicious motherhood ????.Then in the eighth year, <br />(he) with a large army having sacked Goradhagiri</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L.8) causes pressure on Rajagaha (Rajagriha). On account <br />of the loud report of this act of valour, the Yavana (Greek) King Dimi</p></blockquote>
<p>[ta] retreated to Mathura having extricated his demoralized army and <br />transport.? ?????.(He) gives?????..with foliage</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 9) Kalpa (wish-fulfilling) trees, elephants, chariots <br />with their drivers, houses, residences and rest-houses. And to make </p></blockquote>
<p>all these acceptable (he) gives at a fire sacrifice (?) exemption <br />(from taxes) to the caste of Brahmanas. Of <br />Arhat ..................................</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 10) ..................(He) causes to be built . . . . <br />a royal residence (called) the Palace of Great Victory (Mahavijaya) </p></blockquote>
<p>at the cost of thirty-eight hundred thousands. And in the tenth year <br />(he), following (the three-fold policy) of chastisement, alliance and <br />conciliation sends out an expedition against Bharatavasa (and) brings <br />about the conquest of the land (or, country) ........ and obtains <br />jewels and precious things of the (kings) attacked.</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L.11) .................. And the market-town (?) <br />Pithumda founded by the Ava King he ploughs down with a plough of </p></blockquote>
<p>asses; and (he) thoroughly breaks up the confederacy of the T[r]amira <br />(Dramira) countries of one hundred and thirteen years, which has been <br />a source of danger to (his) Country (Janapada). And in the twelfth <br />year he terrifies the kings of the Utarapatha with .................. <br />thousands of</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L.12) .................. And causing panic amongst the <br />people of Magadha (he) drives (his) elephants into the Sugamgiya </p></blockquote>
<p>(Palace), and (he) makes the King of Magadha, Bahasatimita, bow at <br />his feet. And (he) sets up (the image) 'the Jina of Kalinga' which <br />had been taken away by King Nanda .................. and causes to be <br />brought home the riches of Amga and Magadha along with the keepers of <br />the family jewels </p>
<blockquote><p>  of ....................</p>
<p>  (L. 13) .................(He) builds excellent towers <br />with carved interiors and creates a settlement of a hundred masons, </p></blockquote>
<p>giving them exemption from land revenue. And a wonderful and <br />marvellous enclosure of stockade for driving in the elephants <br />(he)...... and horses, elephants, jewels and rubies as well as <br />numerous pearls in hundreds (he) causes to be brought here from the <br />Pandya King.</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 14) .................(he) subjugates. In the <br />thirteenth year, on the Kumari Hill where the Wheel of Conquest had </p></blockquote>
<p>been well-revolved (i.e., the religion of Jina had been preached), <br />(he) offers respectfully royal maintenances, China clothes (silks) <br />and white clothes to (the monks) who (by their austerities) have <br />extinguished the round of lives, the preachers on the religious life <br />and conduct at the Relic Memorial. By Kharavela, the illustrious, an <br />a layman devoted to worship, is realised (the nature of) jiva and deha</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 15) ................ bringing about a Council of the <br />wise ascetics and sages, from hundred (i.e., all) quarters, the monks </p></blockquote>
<p>(samanas) of good deeds and who have fully followed (the <br />injunctions) .................. near the Relic Depository of the <br />Arhat, on the top of the hill, ............ with <br />stones .............. brought from many miles (yojanas) quarried from <br />excellent mines (he builds) shelters for the Sinhapatha Queen <br />Sindhula. ................ .........................</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 16) .................Patalaka(?)???(he) sets up four <br />columns inlaid with beryl??..at the cost of twenty-five hundred </p></blockquote>
<p>thousands; (he) causes to be compiled expeditiously the (text) of the <br />seven-fold Angas of the sixty-four (letters). He is the King of <br />Peace, the King of Prosperity, the King of Monks (bhikshus), the King <br />of Religion (Dharma), who has been seeing, hearing and realising <br />blessings (kalyanas)-</p>
<blockquote><p>  (L. 17) ................ accomplished in extraordinary <br />virtues, respector of every sect, the repairer of all temples, one </p></blockquote>
<p>whose chariot and army are irresistible, one whose empire is <br />protected by the chief of the empire (himself), descended from the <br />family of the Royal Sage Vasu, the Great conqueror, the King, the <br />illustrious Kharavela.</p>

By illustrious Kharavela, the Aira (Aila), the Great King, the descendant of Mahameghavahana, the increaser (of the glory) of the Cheti (Chedi) dynasty, (endowed) with excellent and auspicious marks and features, possessed of virtues which have reached (the ends of) the four quarters, overlord of Kalinga,</p>

Again in the third year,</p>
