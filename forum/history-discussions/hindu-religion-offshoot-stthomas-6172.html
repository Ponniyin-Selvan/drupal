<p>  Good flow of discussions.</p>
<p>  Sorry to digress - can we, just for a few minutes put the language<br />  issue apart and look what history we have at hand? The real history is<br />  confined to only a small group like ours. What is being taught to us<br />  in books - the adulterated history by the europeans to disparage<br />  Indians. Right.</p>
<p>  When we blame the past for setting our history wrong, do we look at<br />  the present?</p>
<p>  I came across the below link and really did not know whether to laugh<br />  or cry.</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.tamilhin" title="http://www.tamilhin">http://www.tamilhin</a> du.com/2008/ 08/saint- thomas-series- 02/</p>
<p>  Just thought will share this, because our current challenge is the<br />  subject and then decide on what language the subject should be learned<br />  or read.</p>
<p>  With due regards,<br />  Satish</p>

<p>    we may not have killed people for the sake of religion ( i guess <br />  not <br />    many hindus feels the need to preach or convert others or kill <br />  those <br />    of aniother religion) but we certainly did kill for land and other <br />    things.<br />    one of our greatest philosophies the gita was delivered on the <br />  battle <br />    field to persude a reluctant warrior to kill.<br />    buddhism was " perhaps" a rebellion to the excessive violence <br />    prevailing in that times. otherwise preaching non violence it would <br />    not have become so popular.</p>

<p>After reading these discussions, I remember Swami Vivekanand's <br />anguish cry in Chicago's World religion conference"If we Hindus dig <br />out all the dirt from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and throw it in <br />you faces, it will be but a speck compared to what the missionaries <br />have done to our religion and culture". </p>
<p>Indian History, as it is taught today, unfortunately which we read, <br />is a anglicised version.Right from the Aryan invasion theory to <br />claiming that Islam invasion fine tuned our architecture and worse, <br />to, English invasion reformed Indian Education system.</p>
<p>Indian History needs to be re-written.As many of you would have heard <br />of Francois Gautier. In his book,"India's Self denial", he claims its <br />high time that India rewrites its history and if it does India will <br />be the spiritual capital of this materialistic world.</p>

<p>    hi</p>
<p>    Romila thappar, I remember wrote some ` new ' findings about the <br />    reasons for gazni's attacks on somanth n mathura... ( <br />incidentally <br />    much of the history that is taught tdy in indian schools are said <br />  to <br />    be `her' version)</p>
<p>    But one thing, amidst everything wrong that is said about gazni, <br />i <br />    see the greatness of our artists and sculptures....for even in <br />the <br />    eyes of a man who is intent of destroying every brick ....they <br />did <br />    evoke albeit for a minute a sense of awe.....</p>
<p>    this is an account from Md's when he saw the temple in matura     </p>
<p>    It is true that Mahamud was wonder-struck on seeing the <br />  magnificent <br />    temples of Mathura. It is also perfectly true that he appreciated <br />    them immensely. The book `Tarikh-Yemini' written by Mahamud's <br />    personal secretary Abunanar Muhammud Ibni Muhmud Al Jabbaral Utpi <br />    (shortly Utpi) bears testimony to this. Following is what Al Utpi <br />    had written about the temple town of Mathura: "In the middle of <br />  the <br />    city there was a temple longer and firmer than the rest. The <br />  Sultan <br />    thus wrote respecting it. `If any should wish to construct a <br />    building equal to this, he would not be able to do it without <br />    expending an hundred thousand thousand red dinars and it would <br />    occupy two hundred years even though the most experienced and <br />able <br />    workmen are employed.'   </p>
<p>    Guess he continued....Ok, now raise it to the ground.....</p></vj.episteme@></p></blockquote>

        <p>Ravi, I have tried to look at it from that perspective. For one thing, as Iwas trying to tell Satish if you study?puranas all actions have karma. Krishna got hit by an arrow in the last stages of his avatar by a hunter whowas supposedly Vali in his previous birth - therefore balancing his own karmic scales.Balarama/Adisesha is born as his elder brother instead of younger so that he could be the one in charge (atleast sometimes) in the second birth. The last chapter of the Mahabharat actually talks about Duryodhana in heaven and the Pandavas in hell paying for their karma. The pandavas actually lose all their progeny except one in the great fire that Dhristhadyumna sets to their tent.<br />?<br />The actions of the Mahabharat therefore led to more bad karma, not less. And sometimes it is really clueless what God/Krishna was doing then. There isone out of the ordinary explanation that I have read somewhere that analysed Krishna's life and said that he was only divine in parts - such as whilesaving Draupadi and while going on a mission to stop the war. In others hewas human like anyone and trying to take advantage of the situation. Of course as Krishna devotees we may not find this palatable.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Beeshma - noblest of all human souls at his time, gave us the Vishnu <br />Sahasranama, well, he did not seem to have an issue with being hit by <br />Krsna's antics, we should think why.</p>

<p>  hi</p>
<p>  Romila thappar, I remember wrote some ` new ' findings about the <br />  reasons for gazni's attacks on somanth n mathura... ( incidentally <br />  much of the history that is taught tdy in indian schools are said <br />to <br />  be `her' version)</p>
<p>  But one thing, amidst everything wrong that is said about gazni, i <br />  see the greatness of our artists and sculptures....for even in the <br />  eyes of a man who is intent of destroying every brick ....they did <br />  evoke albeit for a minute a sense of awe.....</p>
<p>  this is an account from Md's when he saw the temple in matura     </p>
<p>  It is true that Mahamud was wonder-struck on seeing the <br />magnificent <br />  temples of Mathura. It is also perfectly true that he appreciated <br />  them immensely. The book `Tarikh-Yemini' written by Mahamud's <br />  personal secretary Abunanar Muhammud Ibni Muhmud Al Jabbaral Utpi <br />  (shortly Utpi) bears testimony to this. Following is what Al Utpi <br />  had written about the temple town of Mathura: "In the middle of <br />the <br />  city there was a temple longer and firmer than the rest. The <br />Sultan <br />  thus wrote respecting it. `If any should wish to construct a <br />  building equal to this, he would not be able to do it without <br />  expending an hundred thousand thousand red dinars and it would <br />  occupy two hundred years even though the most experienced and able <br />  workmen are employed.'   </p>
<p>  Guess he continued....Ok, now raise it to the ground.....</p>

<p>Yes I agree. But I do have some issues with the means handled by Sri Krishna himself in eliminatiing the opposite side, especially Bheeshma, Drona andother seniors. The only way we can justify that is that Sri Krishna was God and could do what He wanted to end the battle. There is no evidence that Duryodhana was a bad ruler, perhaps he was bad to his cousins. There are many ambiguities in our puranas and too many machiavellian justifications (means justifying the end). </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I agree to the concept of budhism evolution, but the example of Gita <br />is not accurate, the story before is key. I am not sure if the <br />comparison is right. <br />Gajini killed for money - he was victorious too, i think its unfair <br />to equate him even conceptually to Arjuna.</p>

<p>  we may not have killed people for the sake of religion ( i guess <br />not <br />  many hindus feels the need to preach or convert others or kill <br />those <br />  of aniother religion) but we certainly did kill for land and other <br />  things.<br />  one of our greatest philosophies the gita was delivered on the <br />battle <br />  field to persude a reluctant warrior to kill.<br />  buddhism was " perhaps" a rebellion to the excessive violence <br />  prevailing in that times. otherwise preaching non violence it would <br />  not have become so popular.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Killing a human, for war or for day to day basis, is karmically the<br />same. </p></blockquote>
<p>Is it?? I am really surprised to hear this. In Gita, 2nd chapter,<br />sankya yoga, Krishna painstakingly explains Arjuna that if a<br />kshathriya is not killing his enemies in the war, then he is not doing<br />his duty properly and will face disgrace from the entire living beings<br />- humans,animals, devas, kinnaras and what not - and his duty is to<br />fight without considering whom he is killing in the battle.</p>
<p>Its dharma of a kshatriya to kill in battle but killing someone on a<br />normal circumstance is surely sin.</p>
<p>Am i understanding something wrong? or can you please clarify?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

<blockquote><p>  Gajini killed for money - he was victorious too, i think its <br />unfair <br />  to equate him even conceptually to Arjuna.</p></blockquote>
<p>hi</p>
<p>Romila thappar, I remember wrote some ` new ' findings about the <br />reasons for gazni's attacks on somanth n mathura... ( incidentally <br />much of the history that is taught tdy in indian schools are said to <br />be `her' version)</p>
<p>But one thing, amidst everything wrong that is said about gazni, i <br />see the greatness of our artists and sculptures....for even in the <br />eyes of a man who is intent of destroying every brick ....they did <br />evoke albeit for a minute a sense of awe.....</p>
<p>this is an account from Md's when he saw the temple in matura     </p>
<p>It is true that Mahamud was wonder-struck on seeing the magnificent <br />temples of Mathura. It is also perfectly true that he appreciated <br />them immensely. The book `Tarikh-Yemini' written by Mahamud's <br />personal secretary Abunanar Muhammud Ibni Muhmud Al Jabbaral Utpi <br />(shortly Utpi) bears testimony to this. Following is what Al Utpi <br />had written about the temple town of Mathura: "In the middle of the <br />city there was a temple longer and firmer than the rest. The Sultan <br />thus wrote respecting it. `If any should wish to construct a <br />building equal to this, he would not be able to do it without <br />expending an hundred thousand thousand red dinars and it would <br />occupy two hundred years even though the most experienced and able <br />workmen are employed.'   </p>
<p>Guess he continued....Ok, now raise it to the ground.....</p>

        <p>Venkat, very well put, yes I agree. Killing a human, for war or for day to day basis, is karmically the same. There is a very interesting argument between Sri Rama and Sita in Aranya Khanda on this - Sita argues on Sri Rama'spromise to the rishis to kill every rakshasa he sees, her stance is that it is wrong to kill just a rakshasa if you do not know he harmed anyone. Valmiki does not end their debate with anything conclusive just with that Rama's respect for his wife increased several times after her stance in the matter.<br />?<br />Sanatana Dharma, i hesitate when I hear that word. There are numerous gurus/ teachers, each with their own take on what constitues dharma. The eternaldharmic principle is only 'do unto others....'. All others are rules for living, which may or may not be valid in any time and age.? There are gurus such as Ramana and Ramakrishna who did not teach any dharmic rules at all- they only taught spiritual grace and liberation. To my mind the beauty of hinduism is the freedom to practice and spiritual grace with no rules attached. True spiritual grace automatically creates the right dharma.<br />?<br />Malathi<br />?</p>

<p>Hi sathish</p>
<p>that was just a passing remark on the location of the creation of the <br />githa.</p>
<p>my point is there are very few pointers in hindu texts to desist from <br />war. i perfectly understand the environment those days . i am just <br />mentioning that war and killing were a part of routine life and ran <br />side by side with hinduism.<br />the first organised approach in the entire world to non violence was <br />the buddhist doctrine. it was revolutionary during those times and <br />must have therefore been very contradictory to the prevailing <br />situation.</p>
<p>i feel buddhism was a protest against the violence prevailing as much <br />as the ritualism that had crept into hinduism.</p>
<p>and i didnt compare gazni with arjuna at all. neither were mentioned. <br />its just that our god did not preach under a bodhi tree but a <br />warfield.</p>
<p>frankly speaking the present environment of human rights ( inspite of <br />gross violations) is perhaps the best of its kind since mankind rose.</p>

<p>  Come on Venkatesh. While talking about Religious principles, you are<br />  mixing up governance. Though its part of the system, the doctrine,<br />  even in Gita is clear - only warriors during times of war should<br />  fight. Though its violence, its not a common man violence. War is <br />war<br />  and not a day to day affair.</p>
<p>  Its kshatriya dharma, under the karma yoga...</p>

<p>    brain strom...</p>
<p>      what indeed is hindu religion? </p>
<p>    its evolved as a way of life because of its age and capacity to <br />    assimilate other beleifs</p>
<p>      what are its main pillars - beliefs.</p>
<p>    idol worship is one that differentiates it from others. a karmic <br />    beleif that good always triumphs over evil. <br />    no no we do not profess non violence. there has been plenty of <br />    violence on other religions especially in tamilnadu 's hey days.</p>
<p>      we have a profussion of major and minor dieties and like <br />  popularity <br />      charts - they have had their periods of popularity. </p>
<p>    what gods have become prominent during our times?<br />    prathyankara, <br />    and super popular ayyappa.</p>
<p>      how does hinduism today compare against the vedic religion...</p>
<p>    our vedic anscestors wont recognize it i guess. its changed so <br />much.</p>

        <p>Hi sathish</p>
<p>that was just a passing remark on the location of the creation of the <br />githa.</p>
<p>my point is there are very few pointers in hindu texts to desist from <br />war. i perfectly understand the environment those days . i am just <br />mentioning that war and killing were a part of routine life and ran <br />side by side with hinduism.<br />the first organised approach in the entire world to non violence was <br />the buddhist doctrine. it was revolutionary during those times and <br />must have therefore been very contradictory to the prevailing <br />situation.</p>
<p>i feel buddhism was a protest against the violence prevailing as much <br />as the ritualism that had crept into hinduism.</p>
<p>and i didnt compare gazni with arjuna at all. neither were mentioned. <br />its just that our god did not preach under a bodhi tree but a <br />warfield.</p>
<p>frankly speaking the present environment of human rights ( inspite of <br />gross violations) is perhaps the best of its kind since mankind rose.</p>

<p>      I am not sure whether we have enough incidents for this. Non <br />    Violence<br />      is ofcourse part of sanathana dharma. </p>
<p>    sathish</p>
<p>    we may not have killed people for the sake of religion ( i guess <br />not <br />    many hindus feels the need to preach or convert others or kill <br />those <br />    of aniother religion) but we certainly did kill for land and <br />other <br />    things.<br />    one of our greatest philosophies the gita was delivered on the <br />battle <br />    field to persude a reluctant warrior to kill.<br />    buddhism was " perhaps" a rebellion to the excessive violence <br />    prevailing in that times. otherwise preaching non violence it <br />would <br />    not have become so popular.</p>
<p>    venketesh</p>
<p>  Come on Venkatesh. While talking about Religious principles, you are<br />  mixing up governance. Though its part of the system, the doctrine,<br />  even in Gita is clear - only warriors during times of war should<br />  fight. Though its violence, its not a common man violence. War is <br />war<br />  and not a day to day affair.</p>
<p>  Its kshatriya dharma, under the karma yoga...</p>

<p>I agree to the concept of budhism evolution, but the example of Gita <br />is not accurate, the story before is key. I am not sure if the <br />comparison is right. <br />Gajini killed for money - he was victorious too, i think its unfair <br />to equate him even conceptually to Arjuna.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether we have enough incidents for this. Non Violence<br />is ofcourse part of sanathana dharma. When the foundation is based on<br />Soul and soul is accepted to be one (whether advaitham or dwaitham,<br />its said the soul merges with paramathma or the soul itself is<br />paramatham), then sanathana dharma does say that all lives should be<br />treated equal and hence forget killing, harming other living being<br />itself is not allowed.</p>
<p>If you quote 'Ennayiram', again no definite proof - we have argued on<br />it already. U.Ve.Sa has written that, it got its name because 8000<br />brahmin families settled in this place and later formed the<br />'brahacharam' community in brahmins. </p>
<p>Refer to this link - <a href="http://jeyamohan.in/?p=517" title="http://jeyamohan.in/?p=517">http://jeyamohan.in/?p=517</a></p>
<p>Jeyamohan, while reviewing Dasavaatharam has said that, there were<br />clashes but definitely not bloodshed.</p>
<p>There was a practice in olden days - if someone gets defeated in<br />religious debate, they commit suicide. Mostly kazhu. Even Kumarila<br />batter (am i correct?) got into burning umi because he won the debate<br />against jains in unethical way.</p>
<p>So I am not sure, there were any violence - ofcourse stray incidents<br />could not be discounted. But surely not in the scale of other religions.</p>
<p>Idol worship - is it exclusive to Sanathana dharma?? What does Jesus<br />on the cross then? What is Mother mary with infant jesus? Are they not<br />idols? Why muslims do namaaz only towards mecca why not in any<br />direction? or why do they have the picture of mecca in their homes?<br />Only thing is, Sanathana dharma has many idols where as other<br />religions have only one or a few. Convergence of energy, as Ravi<br />pointed. Just symbolism. I am really surprised, why the Europeans,<br />though worshiping Jesus in the form of idols, called us 'Idolaters'.<br />Even Marco mentions the asian community as idolaters. </p>
<p>Talking about this 'nameless' religion or way of life is a never<br />ending loop. namma sitrarivukku apparpattathu. </p>
<p>But one thing is for sure - no other religion gives so much<br />flexibility and so many ways for salvation (karma, bakthi, jnana)<br />amongst the religions which says, if you dont pray my god, you will go<br />to hell. </p>
<p>Sanathana dharma lays a big plantain leaf and serves all the possible<br />dishes in it and its up to us to take and eat what we want or rather<br />what we like.</p>

<p>To find answer to this question, please do read Mr.Cho's "Hindu Maha<br />Samudram" first chapter when it was started way back in 2004. That<br />explanation is convincing. Rathar than me reproducing the words of Mr.Cho it<br />would be better if you people can read it for yourself. Historians place the<br />origin of Hindu OR Vedic Age as 4000 BC. But Mr Cho argues that Hindu<br />religion and Vedas are much much more older than what the historians claim<br />to be.</p>

<p>at various locations...<br />Hindu religion is a name that is new, I would say the 'name' is less <br />han a few hundred years old. <br />Its principle however is time tested is specifically 'nameless'.</p>

<p>little knowldge, sastha and skanda are the same energy in different <br />concepts.<br />Ayyapa is a representation of sastha and like ayyanar, much to the <br />newer generation. </p>

        <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Of late there is a growing tendency on the Evangelists to play on the sentiments of the donor, by projecting huge following or huge suffering that they are trying to alleviate. This movie attempt is another way of making money for a selected few, by making the donor think they will have a huge conversion after the movie release. </p>
<p>Most of the money received by the evangelical organizations go into the pocket of the individuals who run these organizations and only 10% or less go towards the actual purpose for which the money is received. Strangely very few (or none) Hindu organizations are making an actual attempt to engage people socially, culturally and economically. </p>

<p>Yes. Maabar is Malabar. Its deduced that he calls all the area north<br />of Kanyakumari as Maabar by mistake. The deduction is based on other<br />notes that, from the site of St.Thomas, around 500miles north, he<br />mentions about Machilipatnam. So its deduced that he is referring to<br />Madras while he talks about Thomas. And the place full of Peacock<br />supports the argument of Mylai. </p>
<p>He does mention about some chieftains, their dressing and ornaments,<br />but not sure whether they are Pandyas. </p>
<p>One think I remember and smile at is - he says, people in this area<br />likes their skin to be dark and hence apply oil on the entire body of<br />the child to make them more darker. Even they have their idols bathed<br />in oil and make them black. </p>
<p>Was wondering, applying oil - is it to make ourselves black??</p>

<p>Vijay,</p>
<p>This myth is long busted - to whom? Only to this group (atleast),<br />right? What about the outside world? A movie being made on this<br />subject at a cost of 50 crore rupees and mocking that Tiruvalluvar met<br />thomas and Rajni and Kamal endorsing such stories by their cast......</p>
<p>The pulse polio campaign became a hit in TN because of a commercial in<br />80's in which Rajni appeared (ofcourse Manorama also did one). This<br />shows the impact of Rajni in TN (and we know how he turned TN politics<br />with his open support to DMK-TMC in 96)</p>
<p>So if Rajini plays Tiruvalluvar, this myth becomes an immortal history.</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Once you read through enough material on this - you will know that <br />this Thomas and the St thomas are not the same person.</p>
<p>you can read more here</p>
<p><a href="http://hamsa.org/" title="http://hamsa.org/">http://hamsa.org/</a></p>
<p>this entire story and the tiruvalluvar movie...</p>
<p>Lets take a look at this from common sense perspective. Its well <br />known fact that christianity in its current form took about 20 -25  <br />years post the curcifixtion to attain </p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>reposting an earlier post<br />( you can see some lovely movies on this like the Robe </p>
<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Robe_(film)</p>
<p>and its sequel</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_and_the_Gladiators" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_and_the_Gladiators">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_and_the_Gladiators</a></p>
<p>Now, during this period - most of the efforts of the new religion <br />were cladestine - as they were under the roman sword ( actually <br />there is beautiful coincidence with PS - remember the secret symbols <br />of the pandya spies - they show the mark of the fish on their <br />forehead - the early christians identified themselves with their <br />folk similarly - making a sign of the fish on their foreheads...</p>
<p>Incidentally - the Greek word for fish (ichthus, spelled: Iota Chi<br />Theta Upsilon Sigma). That is an acrostic for "Jesus Christ, of<br />God, the Son, the Savior" [Iesous (Jesus) CHristos (Christ) THeou (of<br />God) Uiou (the Son) Soter (the Savior)]. An acrostic is<br />an "arrangement of words in which the first letter of each line<br />ordinarily combines with others to form a word or words or the<br />alphabet..</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Now back to subject - if St thomas who lived during christ's times, <br />presume the efforts to compile the bible and to propagate the new <br />religion in europe would be the paramount importance -not sail away <br />to far off land like india - and to say that he would have carried <br />the bible with him and he met valluvar etc is some good old <br />fashioned wishful thinking and imagination running riot. with due <br />respects to everyone - this myth is long busted.</p>

        <p>In our country, due to our ignorance and various other reasons, the<br />majority are carried away by such lies. Only the elite will laugh and<br />brush it aside, but what about the masses? Even elites get carried<br />away sometimes.</p>
<p>Again digressing - recently we too discussed about St.thomas in our<br />group. Even our R.Venkatesh quoted that Marco polo has recorded about<br />St.Thomas. The current propaganda is that St.Thomas was killed by<br />Brahmins.</p>
<p>So i thought I will get first hand information about this and read the<br />original 'Travels of Marco Polo'. (Its even available in scanned<br />version in google books). Marco has commonly called the area as<br />Maabar. Not sure whether its Madras. No mention of any hill (st.thomas<br />mount in madras) but he gives detailed geographical description at<br />many of other occations. He says, IT IS SAID that when St.Thomas was<br />meditating, a community (he calls them Gaur or something) who hunts<br />for living and do not kill cow, but eats cow if killed by sarcasans<br />(?), while shooting an arrow at peococks (he says the place is full of<br />peococks, probably mylapore) accidentally hits St.Thomas and hence<br />Thomas dies. </p>

<p>      Good flow of discussions.</p>
<p>      Sorry to digress - can we, just for a few minutes put the <br />language<br />      issue apart and look what history we have at hand? The real <br />  history is<br />      confined to only a small group like ours. What is being taught <br />to <br />  us<br />      in books - the adulterated history by the europeans to disparage<br />      Indians. Right.</p>
<p>      When we blame the past for setting our history wrong, do we <br />look <br />  at<br />      the present?</p>
