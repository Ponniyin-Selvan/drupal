</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear All,<br />When our common interest is with Ponniyin<br />Selvan, and Kalki's great contribution to Tamil and<br />making us all love in classical historical novel, I<br />begin to think of it in relation to Gandhi's Opinion<br />on education in English.<br />"I find daily proof of the increasing &amp; continuing<br />wrong being done to the millions by our false<br />de-Indianizing education."<br />More at,<br /><a href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm" title="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm">http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm</a><br />I wonder, with the same thoughts, had <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  been written<br />in English,by "KALKI" if it would have generated the<br />same interest among us?<br />Afterall there are English works by writers like RK<br />Narayanan and others,but I doubt if it could match the<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  "spark" as we see it here.May be we need to accept<br />that the "natural flavour" or "sparks" comes only with<br />mother tongue.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>May be we need to think on more Tamil Classics and<br />popularising the kinds of historical novels as novels<br />more specifically,than just historical<br />facts.Ofcourse,visits to places mentioned in<br />historical novels helps us to know facts from<br />fictions.</p>
<p>I also wonder at the different languages mentioned in<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ?I am sure there might be more than Tamil?But have<br />no idea,what other languages??????</acronym></p>

          Historical Novel in Tamil/English or ???        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear All<br />We all have concerns about the changes our language has undergone...but look at it this way how many nations and cults have dissappeared in foreign invasions...and colonisation.<br />Where is the aborigine heritage in australia , the native american heritage in USA or the Incas and Aztecs....even examples are found in parts of africa...the egyptian heritage has given way to arabic...sane with the persian and mesopotomian...<br />But look at tamil still going strong inspite of christian,moslem,english influences it has outlived all other classical languages<br />yes it has changed and evolved thats the nature of all languages..even english has evolved with time ...do you know how many tamil and indian words are part of english language<br />Thats the norm<br />But we have to be proud that we have a heritage and language which is 2500 or maybe 5000 years old<br />sridhar</p>
<p>mathava ramanan <smaramanan@yahoo.com  wrote:Dear All,<br />Mani,Thank you for the additional input from<br />a view of "identity" tool for a language, which was<br />also brought up by Pavithra to mention on the<br />invations...and Sridhar's concerns too.<br />I was thinking of giving examples,but the Malaysian<br />strong example gives more than what I was thinking,but<br />I few points anyway :),and avoid my weak example.</smaramanan@yahoo.com></p>

<p>One reason why Tamil readers from India,may not find<br />it important may be that unlike readers from Malaysia<br />or any other regions,(where Tamils have to constantly<br />maintain their identity and also struggle against<br />discriminations,if there are any)Tamils of Tamil Nadu<br />enjoy a lot more freedom and so people look at the<br />"artistic","narratic","styles","romance" etc as the<br />mind set of Tamils in Tamil Nadu are not in position<br />to think of "protecting the language",Afterall its<br />only threat comes from English,which is a universal<br />language and its marketed worldwide.And to add further<br />was the views of Mahatma and President on the "Foreign<br />Love", which has taken its toll for more than nearly<br />200 years of Indian history.This("Foreign love") is<br />applicable to the language itself.</p>
<p>But I am sure,people one day(no idea when may be it<br />takes another 200 or 500 or ???? or in couple of<br />years) to realise, that we need to have our language<br />by growing the language instead of "changing" it,every<br />historical periods have had a "revival" if one thinks<br />the period was "dark".So basically one doesn't have to<br />worry, as we see here the growth of Tamil to Inernet<br />by the contributions of many great Tamils of our Tamil<br />lovers,but one should constantly think,<br />on Mahakavi's words of "translating other language<br />great literatures to Tamil", and Vise-verse I think<br />this is a better way of "adopting" the necessary<br />changes.This will only help our future generation,as<br />how our past/present generation helped to bring Tamil<br />to internet.<br />Like what already people's initiative had brought<br />Tamil to the internet.Instead if we think,Tamil is not<br />suitable for internet,then Tamil will face more<br />challenges.But opening Tamil and still preserving and<br />growing with more additional words when needed,instead<br />of directly borrowing words from other languages is a<br />great way as some people are engaged in.<br />This <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is one way of maintaining,but we need to be<br />aware of those historical moments,their change,their<br />survival,their relevance,etc....<br />I wish I know what was Kalki's opinions on developing<br />Tamil,or his opinion on English as a medium of<br />instruction.Afterall he produced a master piece in<br />Tamil.<br />This forum could develop ideas for promoting reading<br />of Tamil classics, I think its the NEED OF THE HOUR.</acronym></p>
<p>Children are taken in a big wave and if they don't<br />root firmly,they would again add to those,ROOTLESS<br />RABBLE ROUSERS and ofcourse they might come back to<br />the roots,but why all the long journey?Afterall we are<br />talking of our own Children and us.Is it not?</p>

<p>When we hear that lots and lots of "Suvadies" are in<br />foreign museums, Cann't we think of "DIGITALISING"<br />those TAMIL Suvadies, as we think of "Digitalising"<br />other Tamil Suvadies?????Is digitalising applicable<br />only to Suvadies in Tamil Nadu or ?????<br />Hope someone thinks of it.....</p>

<p>  Let me give a simple example of how a language<br />  survives.I am from <br />  India. But I live in Malaysia. Here we have a huge<br />  local Indian <br />  community.

The guys<br />  mother toungue is <br />  supposed to be telugu. He doesn't know telugu. Tamil<br />  is his un <br />  official mother toungue. This is not tamil nadu to<br />  pretend that it is <br />  quite natural.</p>
<p>  There are malayalees aswell who are more fluent in<br />  tamil. The <br />  point I want to convey is the tamils were strict<br />  about their language <br />  in this land.

<blockquote><p>  Dear All,<br />  Thank you Sridhar for sharing thoughts and<br />  mentioning,the time immortality of Tamil language as<br />  Kalthonri man thonra kaalathe mun thonriya mootha<br />  mozhi.....</p>
<p>  It definitely makes one feel proud.</p>
<p>  As for feeling on "foregin crazy" attitude. I don't<br />  think its a curse or it applies to everyone.Some are<br />  upholding the land's<br />  traditions,cultures,langues,etc...thats one reason as<br />  pointed for the growth of Tamil to internet from<br />  Olaisuvadi...But my point is there are many,who do<br />  have this "foreign crazy" attitude...still...the sad<br />  part is they represent the "elites" or "imitators".<br />  Which I wanted to think from,</p>
<p>  Gandhi's,(before 1950s)<br />  Hundreds of youth believe that without the Knowledge<br />  of English. freedom of India is practically<br />  impossible.<br />  Education through a foreign Language entails a certain<br />  degree of strain, and our boys have to pay dearly for<br />  it. To a large extent, they lose the capacity of<br />  shouldering any other burden afterwards., for they<br />  become a useless lot who are weak of body, without any<br />  zest for work and imitators of the West. They have<br />  little interest in original research or deep<br />  thinking, and the qualities of courage, perseverance.<br />  bravery and fearlessness are lacking. That is why we<br />  are unable to make new plans or carry our projects to<br />  meet our problems.<br />  <a href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm" title="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm">http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm</a></p>
<p>  If Mahatma's words spoken more than 50 years is<br />  difficult and may be even painful to accept.<br />  But what about,the questions of the President as a<br />  Scientist in 1998,just few years before...</p>
<p>  Why are we, as a nation so obsessed with foreign<br />  things?<br />  Is it a legacy of our colonial years? We want foreign<br />  television sets. We<br />  want foreign shirts. We want foreign technology. Why<br />  this obsession with<br />  everything imported? Do we not realise that self<br />  respect<br />  comes with self reliance?</p>
<p>  Cann't we get answers from Mahatma's and President's<br />  words.(May be this is one reason,why President likes<br />  to talk to Children who are unspoilt(or before the<br />  influence) with this "foreign craze")</p>
<p>  Again on Gandhi's words,lays lots of answer..for me to<br />  not call it a curse,its just our "thinking" from the<br />  education,media,hald learnt(or articulated)<br />  history,etc.</p>
<p>  The foreign medium has caused brains fag, put an undue<br />  strain upon the nerves of our children, made them<br />  crammers and imitators, unfitted them for original<br />  work and thought, and disabled them for filtrating<br />  their learning to the family or the masses. The<br />  foreign medium has made our children practically<br />  foreigners in their own lands. It is the greatest<br />  tragedy of the existing system. Among the many evils<br />  of foreign rule, this blighting imposition of a<br />  foreign medium upon the youth of the country will be<br />  counted by history as one of the greatest. </p>
<p>  May be one hasn't "still" come to the period which<br />  Mahatma is referring as "counted by history".</p>
<p>  Brains have been made to what Mahatma calls as "daily<br />  proof" for more than 50 years has taken a toll,that<br />  people find it hard to understand/accept what Mahatma<br />  is talking about.</p>
<p>  How did,people who constructed Big Temples,dams,ships<br />  acquired the knowledge?<br />  India's contribution to the world of science and<br />  technology is as immeasurable as any other<br />  contributions.Remember the number systems being taught<br />  as Arabic was learnt from Indians.Europeans learnt it<br />  from Arabs.</p>
<p>  Did we know that colonizers had to "engineer" against<br />  many obstracles during their initial periods of<br />  149x,not to mention their engieering skills in ship<br />  building to carry them across the rough seas,but also<br />  against the "foreign" languages??????</p>
<p>  And more reasons for the introduction of "English"<br />  among the masses are mentioned in the wonderful(might<br />  be hard and difficult to accept at different<br />  pages),book by Michael Adas,"Machines as the measure<br />  of men".</p>
<p>  I think,PS group could think in terms of finding<br />  answers to <br />  How did the transformation that we see today had taken<br />  place in Chola Nadu???from its great heights???<br />  What can be learnt????</p>
<p>  If our language from Chola period had changed,why did<br />  it change?????</p>
<p>  If languages needs to be replaced,why????how its<br />  done????whats the time period????<br />  Who gains?????Who loses?????on what???Why???</p>
<p>  It might be easy to accept that the "natural flavour"<br />  is distinctly seen in reading a classical novel like<br />  Kalki's PS,but I wonder what makes it difficult to<br />  learn from those words to our present situations???<br />  Should we look at PS as mere piece of writing...None<br />  would say so,afterall its a master piece for knowing<br />  the social,political,economic,spiritual what many<br />  conditions of the not so old<br />  Tamils(afterall,Thirukkural age is as Twice as the<br />  time period of PS)<br />  My purpose is to "learn" and "share".I spent time in<br />  learning some Hindi and French and some "cheap books<br />  on contents,but paying more money" on those fanssy<br />  "English" titles like Famous 5s,Secret 7setc..,but was<br />  stupid not to have spent some time on classics like PS<br />  or others...</p>
<p>  I hope to hear more from members,if you all had the<br />  patience to read till now...</p>
<p>  I wonder,when we would have an education,which would<br />  fulfill the dreams of Mahatma,Mahakavi and<br />  President????</p>
<p>  Best Wishes,<br />  Mathav</p>

<p>    Madhav<br />    I share your veiws on how Indians are foreign crazy<br />    both when I was in India nad now in UK...But it is<br />    the curse of the land.<br />    Coming to Tamil...Kalthonri man thonra kaalathe mun<br />    thonriya mootha mozhi....is thamil.There are enough<br />    and more literary treasures in thamil which people<br />    cannot accurately date.and we havent had the same<br />    resources going into our olaisuvadis as the egyptian<br />    papyrus or the sumerian tablets......<br />    As for Sanskrit in PS there is no clear mention of<br />    that in PS though there are some references to that<br />    the story.<br />    Prathakirutham may have evolved into present days<br />    marathi or kannada <br />    Yes thamil would be threatened to extinction but its<br />    a language which has sustained more than 2200 years<br />    as we know so I think it would sustain itself.But<br />    there comes the reole of e groups and networks to<br />    promote the language and heritage.<br />    The need for English I think its quite useful...its<br />    like needing hindi to survive in India you can be a<br />    foolish like me nad not learn it but the wise thing<br />    would be to learn hindi in india thats were the<br />    keralites,andras and kanadigas score over<br />    thamil....the other side of the arguement is tamil<br />    is the mother of malayalam,kannada anf telugu and<br />    thulu so should it be forced to the same status as<br />    them????<br />    The need of english is the need of the hour..atleast<br />    as far the western world is concerned Latinand greek<br />    were replaced by german in the mediaval times and<br />    then french was the supreme language of scholars and<br />    academicians that the language. english replaced it<br />    in the 18th and 19th centuray and was the prime<br />    language and was called 'Lingua franca'(explaining<br />    the importnace french had before)<br />    The examples of germans,japaneses ,french and<br />    italians isnt apt...because apart from french<br />    everybody else learns english alongside their mother<br />    tongue...<br />    It helps you to propagate your language and heritage<br />    better imagine our egroup as a tahmil website..how<br />    many members we would havew lost.<br />    I agree with Pavithra that PS in english will be a<br />    no no no one can match kalkis flair.</p>
<p>    Tamil from the sangam period and PS period is<br />    different to the sopoken tamil.</p>
<p>    Is this one way of gaining on English,at Tamil or<br />    local language???How could we think of Mahakavi's<br />    developing Tamil and still loving other<br />    languages????</p>
<p>    Cheers</p>

          Historical Novel in Tamil/English or ???        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear All, <br />Wishing all the participants best<br />wishes for the wonderful opportunities to interaction.</p>
<p>Pavithra,Thank you very much for some<br />additional inputs to my learning process...<br />on the discussion group especially from people who<br />have read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ,as it helps them to compare the<br />historical significance to the present.</acronym></p>
<p>I would also like to share some more thoughts as they<br />come across my brain which definitely needs some rest<br />:)</p>
<p>1. To the idea, that language would be needed to<br />spread is great.But think,if language is only for<br />spreading???Whats the role of language???Does it has<br />any roles with cultural preparations???<br />If one has to behave as "English", then the society<br />needs to be prepared for "English" tastes??If I<br />understand correctly, this is one reason for language<br />spread,apart from what you mentioned.So it might be<br />that it is to "complete" or even "begin".</p>
<p>2. Yes, I agree to that some tries to gain on some all<br />the time in earth's history.Even if we don't use the<br />word "gain" I think, "invasion" implies<br />gain/lose????This is what one tries to learn in<br />History I suppose....</p>
<p>3. I am not sure, of the "Change is the only thing<br />that can lead to improvement"????I think this is a<br />very complicated statement,atleast for my thinking...<br />May be bacause I read somewhere,"change is the result<br />of instability".<br />But in anycase,the term "change" itself has many<br />dimensions to look for...<br />When we mean,change what change one is talking about?<br />I mean in what time-space????What change do we<br />need?What for that change???Is it a change for better<br />or worse???Change willingly accepted or forced on<br />us???</p>
<p>Evolution is also a change process,so is the Erosion<br />and so are the results of these two processes????And<br />How about growth and development are also change<br />processes and whats their results???</p>
<p>So if we apply this idea,in what category would the<br />changed Tamil fall into????May be both,like it did<br />develop and yet we are not that expert as those old<br />Tamils were once???I wish I know...:)</p>
<p>4.I agree completely that what we read moulds and<br />shapes us,but also wants to add,that<br />they(books/readings) are one factor in many others<br />which shapes us.Among others are,education one<br />receives as a<br />whole,culture,tradition,religion,family,music,dance,thenew<br />medias like TV,films,etc.....</p>
<p>Just one last thought,since I learnt here(didn't had<br />the facility to browse the internet,when I was in<br />Chennai,otherwise may be I would have learnt that<br />there :), how Galileo Galilie to John of Arc suffered<br />in history with different levels of punishment,I<br />constantly try to see two sides of a coin.</p>
<p>A term,I recently came across,is the "social<br />construction". To think, English is education or<br />knowledge might be a social construction or not??</p>
<p>If man didn't land in moon,as some believes so,then<br />could it be a social construction????or not???</p>
<p>The wonderful thing on these is one cann't say,how it<br />takes in time-space for any social construction to <br />embedd in brains...I think I need to shut my thoughts<br />as I see stars in the monitor...</p>
<p>ok time to say bye,<br />Mathav</p>

<p>   If our language from Chola period had changed,why<br />  did<br />   it change?????</p>
<p>  Any country that invades and has been invaded must<br />  be subjected to changes <br />  in languages, right? Language is the first thing<br />  that signifies the entry of <br />  a foreign culture. Any invading culture first<br />  spreads its language to <br />  complete its attack(namely the Mughals, British,<br />  etc.). That's why English <br />  finds so much favour today. If the Thamizh clan had<br />  invaded the world- <br />  Thamizh would have been the global language:-)[aside<br />  from what it is today]</p>
<p>   If languages needs to be replaced,why????how its<br />   done????whats the time period????<br />   Who gains?????Who loses?????on what???Why???</p>
<p>  There's no question of winning/losing. Its a cycle-<br />  rather like waves of an <br />  ocean washing over the shore repeatedly. An invasion<br />  is something that <br />  happens periodically. Some body invades some<br />  country, their culture <br />  undergoes a sea-change.</p>
<p>  Change is the only thing that can lead to<br />  improvement. That which remains <br />  static will degenerate and gradually die. If Thamizh<br />  had not adapted itself <br />  to the demands of today- if it had remained as it<br />  had done in the Chozha <br />  period, chances are that Thamizh would have died<br />  out.</p>
<p>   My purpose is to "learn" and "share".I spent time<br />  in<br />   learning some Hindi and French and some "cheap<br />  books<br />   on contents,but paying more money" on those fanssy<br />   "English" titles like Famous 5s,Secret 7setc..,but<br />  was<br />   stupid not to have spent some time on classics like<br />  PS<br />   or others...</p>
<p>  Whoa....in my opinion, nothing that we read is<br />  exactly 'stupid'. Everything <br />  we read influences us, moulds our mind in some way.<br />  PS is a great work- but <br />  there are other works equally excellent. I don't<br />  think its right to spend <br />  time only on classics all the time.</p>

          Historical Novel in Tamil/English or ???        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear All,<br />Thank you Sridhar for sharing thoughts and<br />mentioning,the time immortality of Tamil language as<br />Kalthonri man thonra kaalathe mun thonriya mootha<br />mozhi.....</p>
<p>It definitely makes one feel proud.</p>
<p>As for feeling on "foregin crazy" attitude. I don't<br />think its a curse or it applies to everyone.Some are<br />upholding the land's<br />traditions,cultures,langues,etc...thats one reason as<br />pointed for the growth of Tamil to internet from<br />Olaisuvadi...But my point is there are many,who do<br />have this "foreign crazy" attitude...still...the sad<br />part is they represent the "elites" or "imitators".<br />Which I wanted to think from,</p>
<p>Gandhi's,(before 1950s)<br />Hundreds of youth believe that without the Knowledge<br />of English. freedom of India is practically<br />impossible.<br />Education through a foreign Language entails a certain<br />degree of strain, and our boys have to pay dearly for<br />it. To a large extent, they lose the capacity of<br />shouldering any other burden afterwards., for they<br />become a useless lot who are weak of body, without any<br />zest for work and imitators of the West. They have<br />little interest in original research or deep<br />thinking, and the qualities of courage, perseverance.<br />bravery and fearlessness are lacking. That is why we<br />are unable to make new plans or carry our projects to<br />meet our problems.<br /><a href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm" title="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm">http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm</a></p>
<p>If Mahatma's words spoken more than 50 years is<br />difficult and may be even painful to accept.<br />But what about,the questions of the President as a<br />Scientist in 1998,just few years before...</p>
<p>Why are we, as a nation so obsessed with foreign<br />things?<br />Is it a legacy of our colonial years? We want foreign<br />television sets. We<br />want foreign shirts. We want foreign technology. Why<br />this obsession with<br />everything imported? Do we not realise that self<br />respect<br />comes with self reliance?</p>
<p>Cann't we get answers from Mahatma's and President's<br />words.(May be this is one reason,why President likes<br />to talk to Children who are unspoilt(or before the<br />influence) with this "foreign craze")</p>
<p>Again on Gandhi's words,lays lots of answer..for me to<br />not call it a curse,its just our "thinking" from the<br />education,media,hald learnt(or articulated)<br />history,etc.</p>
<p>The foreign medium has caused brains fag, put an undue<br />strain upon the nerves of our children, made them<br />crammers and imitators, unfitted them for original<br />work and thought, and disabled them for filtrating<br />their learning to the family or the masses. The<br />foreign medium has made our children practically<br />foreigners in their own lands. It is the greatest<br />tragedy of the existing system. Among the many evils<br />of foreign rule, this blighting imposition of a<br />foreign medium upon the youth of the country will be<br />counted by history as one of the greatest. </p>
<p>May be one hasn't "still" come to the period which<br />Mahatma is referring as "counted by history".</p>
<p>Brains have been made to what Mahatma calls as "daily<br />proof" for more than 50 years has taken a toll,that<br />people find it hard to understand/accept what Mahatma<br />is talking about.</p>
<p>How did,people who constructed Big Temples,dams,ships<br />acquired the knowledge?<br />India's contribution to the world of science and<br />technology is as immeasurable as any other<br />contributions.Remember the number systems being taught<br />as Arabic was learnt from Indians.Europeans learnt it<br />from Arabs.</p>
<p>Did we know that colonizers had to "engineer" against<br />many obstracles during their initial periods of<br />149x,not to mention their engieering skills in ship<br />building to carry them across the rough seas,but also<br />against the "foreign" languages??????</p>
<p>And more reasons for the introduction of "English"<br />among the masses are mentioned in the wonderful(might<br />be hard and difficult to accept at different<br />pages),book by Michael Adas,"Machines as the measure<br />of men".</p>
<p>I think,<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group could think in terms of finding<br />answers to <br />How did the transformation that we see today had taken<br />place in Chola Nadu???from its great heights???<br />What can be learnt????</acronym></p>
<p>If our language from Chola period had changed,why did<br />it change?????</p>
<p>If languages needs to be replaced,why????how its<br />done????whats the time period????<br />Who gains?????Who loses?????on what???Why???</p>
<p>It might be easy to accept that the "natural flavour"<br />is distinctly seen in reading a classical novel like<br />Kalki's <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ,but I wonder what makes it difficult to<br />learn from those words to our present situations???<br />Should we look at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  as mere piece of writing...None<br />would say so,afterall its a master piece for knowing<br />the social,political,economic,spiritual what many<br />conditions of the not so old<br />Tamils(afterall,Thirukkural age is as Twice as the<br />time period of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym )<br />My purpose is to "learn" and "share".I spent time in<br />learning some Hindi and French and some "cheap books<br />on contents,but paying more money" on those fanssy<br />"English" titles like Famous 5s,Secret 7setc..,but was<br />stupid not to have spent some time on classics like <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym <br />or others...</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>I hope to hear more from members,if you all had the<br />patience to read till now...</p>
<p>I wonder,when we would have an education,which would<br />fulfill the dreams of Mahatma,Mahakavi and<br />President????</p>
<p>Best Wishes,<br />Mathav</p>

        <p>Dear All,<br />Thank you,Poonguzhali for some thought provoking<br />inputs and additional informations on Prakrithi being<br />a language and being learnt today as well.I hope Tamil<br />will continue atleast as "Tanglish" in 3003 and no one<br />says like,<br />"Tamil munivargal know this language even now. there<br />are few places where they teach this language."</p>
<p>But it also raises further question.(Apologies if my<br />questions are not interesting to some).Having left the<br />shores,it helped me to learn more on what is<br />relativism is all about and more importantly history<br />of science and technology atleast an introduction.And<br />so is my interest in education in different time<br />periods... </p>
<p>What about Sanskrit as a language getting the place in<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ????I have heard(Sevi Vazhichhaithi) that<br />Suarashtras were very much connected to the Cholas..if<br />thats true,how about that language place in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ???</p>
<p>It also raises,the question, what made Tamil to live<br />and continue today,while Prakrithi(assuming it was<br />common in those times like Tamil), is not so common<br />today????This further puts,what needs to be done to<br />pass on the Tamil of Raja Raja Cholan periods of<br />1000AD today and to continue further so that some in<br />3000AD would still use Tamil atleast as it is today...</p>
<p>I also feel,the Tamil of Raja Raja Cholan period would<br />have been different(difficult for people now),as<br />pointed "Enakku Tamil avvalava varathu"....or people<br />cann't understand what those period Tamil literature<br />would mean to us???? </p>
<p>Is this one way of gaining on English,at Tamil or<br />local language???How could we think of Mahakavi's<br />developing Tamil and still loving other languages????</p>
<p>I still think,mother tongue medium of education and<br />English as a language study would keep India a hot<br />destination????<br />After all,did we have any "English", in 149x(I think<br />1492) when the first colonizers in the name of "trade"<br />landed on the west coast of India.<br />India is a land sure to "attract all"(may be some of<br />its own people might have left) whether it has English<br />or not.Who knows,may be without English, one could<br />also think of Japan,South Korea,Germany,France,any<br />country for that matter...Again I am not critising<br />English,but to think,why we generally think in normal<br />way on English education???<br /><a href="http://www.carnatic.com/kishore/articles/art_0020.html" title="http://www.carnatic.com/kishore/articles/art_0020.html">http://www.carnatic.com/kishore/articles/art_0020.html</a></p>
<p>May be one has to think on the above link,where<br />present President talk on <br />Why are we, as a nation so obsessed with foreign<br />things?<br />Is it a legacy of our colonial years? We want foreign<br />television sets. We<br />want foreign shirts. We want foreign technology. Why<br />this obsession with<br />everything imported? Do we not realise that self<br />respect<br />comes with self reliance?</p>

And<br />  also all the TV presentations would have been in<br />  good tamil instead of like enakku tamil avvalavaa<br />  varaadu type. <br />  Negatively, we would not be chatting/discussing here<br />  in this group for probably there would have been no<br />  ponniyinselvan group or Positively we would be<br />  conversing, chatting, typing everything in our<br />  mothertoungue Tamil. <br />  But regarding PS I can definitely say that it would<br />  not have created this much interest in the minds of<br />  the readers if it had been in English. I read the<br />  English version of PS but did not quite enjoy it. I<br />  am not criticising the English version. Surely it is<br />  a varaprasaadam for those who cannot read Tamil. But<br />  it cannot capture the true essence. Also in the<br />  English version i found lots of tamil words, it was<br />  actually like reading a tanglish version. Surely<br />  there are some words in tamil for which there is no<br />  equivalent English wrod. As you said the Natural<br />  flavor or spark comes only with Tamil.<br />  Kalkiyoda Nadai, Varnanai all those is very<br />  difficult to capture in English.<br />  Regarding the other languages, there is a mention<br />  about prakrutham by Kalki in SS. Most of the jain<br />  scriptures are in Prakrutham only and jaina<br />  munivargal know this language even now. there are<br />  few places where they teach this language. <br />  Regards,<br />  Poonguzhali<br />  mathava ramanan <smaramanan@yahoo.com  wrote:Dear<br />  All,<br />  When our common interest is with Ponniyin<br />  Selvan, and Kalki's great contribution to Tamil and<br />  making us all love in classical historical novel, I<br />  begin to think of it in relation to Gandhi's Opinion<br />  on education in English.<br />  "I find daily proof of the increasing &amp; continuing<br />  wrong being done to the millions by our false<br />  de-Indianizing education."<br />  More at,<br />  <a href="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm" title="http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm">http://www.mkgandhi.org/edugandhi/index.htm</a><br />  I wonder, with the same thoughts, had PS been<br />  written<br />  in English,by "KALKI" if it would have generated the<br />  same interest among us?<br />  Afterall there are English works by writers like RK<br />  Narayanan and others,but I doubt if it could match<br />  the<br />  PS "spark" as we see it here.May be we need to<br />  accept<br />  that the "natural flavour" or "sparks" comes only<br />  with<br />  mother tongue.</smaramanan@yahoo.com></p>
<p>  May be we need to think on more Tamil Classics and<br />  popularising the kinds of historical novels as<br />  novels<br />  more specifically,than just historical<br />  facts.Ofcourse,visits to places mentioned in<br />  historical novels helps us to know facts from<br />  fictions.</p>
<p>  I also wonder at the different languages mentioned<br />  in<br />  PS?I am sure there might be more than Tamil?But have<br />  no idea,what other languages??????</p>

          Historical Novel in Tamil/English or ???        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,<br />I am not sure about what the impact would have been if education was in Tamil or any other indian language instead of English. Probably many of our friends who are now in US, UK, and all other places would not have gone to such places and would be staying in seermigu Tamil Nadu. India as such would be only a tourist destination for foreigners and there would be no Multi National Companies here.<br />Also our culture would have been entirely different. There would be no English movies in theatres. And also all the TV presentations would have been in good tamil instead of like enakku tamil avvalavaa varaadu type. <br />Negatively, we would not be chatting/discussing here in this group for probably there would have been no ponniyinselvan group or Positively we would be conversing, chatting, typing everything in our mothertoungue Tamil. <br />But regarding <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  I can definitely say that it would not have created this much interest in the minds of the readers if it had been in English. I read the English version of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  but did not quite enjoy it. I am not criticising the English version. Surely it is a varaprasaadam for those who cannot read Tamil. But it cannot capture the true essence. Also in the English version i found lots of tamil words, it was actually like reading a tanglish version. Surely there are some words in tamil for which there is no equivalent English wrod. As you said the Natural flavor or spark comes only with Tamil.<br />Kalkiyoda Nadai, Varnanai all those is very difficult to capture in English.<br />Regarding the other languages, there is a mention about prakrutham by Kalki in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym .
