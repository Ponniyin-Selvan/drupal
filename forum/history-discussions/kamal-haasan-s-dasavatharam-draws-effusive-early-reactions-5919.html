</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I know Kamal is an atheist. But its news to me that he has anti god <br />digs in all his movies. May be i have not noticed in that angle.</p>
<p>Today I read an article which says that people with high IQ, who are <br />brilliant doesnt belive in god. The research says that most of the <br />profs and research scholars are atheist. Only people with low IQ <br />belive in God. </p>
<p>Absurd. I would term it as 'thalai ganam'.</p>

        <p>MMKR is a masterpiece, no doubt, Kamal is a genius also, but MMKR is <br />not just Kamal, it was the unit from SNV, Manorama, Urvashi, <br />V.Ramamurthi , Nagesh, S.Barathi,balaji to Bheem all played a pivotal <br />role in the film now that was crafted beautifully by Crazy like the <br />perfect surgeon.<br />Each one lived the film, they gave it all for the movie and it is now <br />among the classics. <br />Bale pandya and Sabash meena are other two in similar leagues, while <br />MMKR tops the list.</p>

<p>  MMkr was a masterpiece.<br />  but did you notice we understood it fully the second time. more so <br />  the third time etc.<br />  i still notice something new everytime I watch MMKr</p>

<p>        Morning I read our group members reviews and was<br />      taken aback. Hindu <br />        will not give a good feedback for any movie and if<br />      Hindu says a <br />      movie <br />        is good, its mostly really good.</p>
<p>        I watched the movie this afternoon. When i came<br />      back, I was <br />      thinking <br />        I will be the odd man out in this group, but<br />      reading Ravi's mail,I <br />        feel I have company :)</p>
<p>        I really liked the movie. I dont think any Indian<br />      movie, or rather <br />        tamil movie had such a gripping script. As the<br />      reviews commented, <br />        Kamal has excelled in his 11th role as a script<br />      writer. This role <br />      was <br />        his best role, I would say. a fast paced movie,<br />      well made with a <br />        decent story line. First attempt in such a scale.</p>
<p>        Disappointing things are the graphics at many<br />      places and the make <br />        ups. And i dont understand why the 12th century<br />      story came into <br />        picture. No connection between that piece of the<br />      story and the <br />        current story, except the vishnu statue coming<br />      ashore in Tsunami. <br />        Otherwise its a well made movie. </p>
<p>        Its a movie for belivers and non belivers. And as<br />      Ravi said, the <br />        final dialogue of Asin has the greates philosophy.<br />      Nothing happens <br />        without a reason. </p>
<p>        One thing that I dont understand is, why 130<br />      crores??? The spl <br />        effects are definitely of the best quality.</p>
<p>        I think many are disappointed only because a lot<br />      of hype was given <br />        for the make up and the spl effects, which I feel<br />      are the only <br />      flaws <br />        in the movie. Probably they should not have given<br />      so much hype for <br />        the things which are of best quality. </p>
<p>        Boovaragavan's character was the best of the 10.<br />      sodapal makesups <br />        were of Bush, and Kaifulla kahn. </p>
<p>        The comedy dialogues have a great impact of Crazy<br />      mohan. Best <br />        was 'azhagiya singer' - madonna....</p>
<p>        Overall, I enjoyed the movie and can surely see a<br />      couple of times <br />        more.</p>

<p>      Morning I read our group members reviews and was<br />    taken aback. Hindu <br />      will not give a good feedback for any movie and if<br />    Hindu says a <br />    movie <br />      is good, its mostly really good.</p>
<p>      I watched the movie this afternoon. When i came<br />    back, I was <br />    thinking <br />      I will be the odd man out in this group, but<br />    reading Ravi's mail,I <br />      feel I have company :)</p>
<p>      I really liked the movie. I dont think any Indian<br />    movie, or rather <br />      tamil movie had such a gripping script. As the<br />    reviews commented, <br />      Kamal has excelled in his 11th role as a script<br />    writer. This role <br />    was <br />      his best role, I would say. a fast paced movie,<br />    well made with a <br />      decent story line. First attempt in such a scale.</p>
<p>      Disappointing things are the graphics at many<br />    places and the make <br />      ups. And i dont understand why the 12th century<br />    story came into <br />      picture. No connection between that piece of the<br />    story and the <br />      current story, except the vishnu statue coming<br />    ashore in Tsunami. <br />      Otherwise its a well made movie. </p>
<p>      Its a movie for belivers and non belivers. And as<br />    Ravi said, the <br />      final dialogue of Asin has the greates philosophy.<br />    Nothing happens <br />      without a reason. </p>
<p>      One thing that I dont understand is, why 130<br />    crores??? The spl <br />      effects are definitely of the best quality.</p>
<p>      I think many are disappointed only because a lot<br />    of hype was given <br />      for the make up and the spl effects, which I feel<br />    are the only <br />    flaws <br />      in the movie. Probably they should not have given<br />    so much hype for <br />      the things which are of best quality. </p>
<p>      Boovaragavan's character was the best of the 10.<br />    sodapal makesups <br />      were of Bush, and Kaifulla kahn. </p>
<p>      The comedy dialogues have a great impact of Crazy<br />    mohan. Best <br />      was 'azhagiya singer' - madonna....</p>
<p>      Overall, I enjoyed the movie and can surely see a<br />    couple of times <br />      more.</p>

        <p>I watched the film, it was an entertainer - forget logistics, if we <br />can accept Sivaji the Boss, this is no less good or bad. Some make <br />ups were horrible, but if you are there for entertainment, Naidu, <br />Grandma and Kalif alone will give your returns.</p>
<p>Ranganathar plays an important role in the movie from the beginning <br />to the end where he protects the world, even if Kamal does not accept <br />that argument, he has proved it without his knowledge...mysterious <br />are the ways of God.. If you read an earlier thread, I had written <br />about mini-pralayams, the Tsunami was comparitively one...according <br />to the story.</p>
<p>Asin speaks like a novice but only people in the elite mind set can <br />understand the grip in which the reality sets in. </p>
<p>Expectation is the key to dissapointment. Go in without any <br />inhibitions, it is worth the money atleast for the first time. </p>

<p>  Sorry to disappoint those who are eagerly waiting..</p>
<p>  Not a "little" let down.. a major one. </p>
<p>  When will our film makers realize that great special </p>
<p>  effects/makeup/ action stunts will never make up for the lack of a </p>
<p>  credible storyline?</p>
<p>  They treat audience like idiots. In fact, using "dasavatharam" as </p>
<p>  title is an insult.. I am okay with agnosticism but this was plain </p>
<p>  bilge.</p>
<p>  This was just a showcase for kamal's adventurism and the makeup-<br />men's </p>
<p>  talent... No more. </p>
<p>  Still smarting from last night's mis-entertainment :((</p>

<blockquote><p>  Satish, Kamal has digs in every movie of his own (not<br />  old ones with KB or other directors), more later ones.<br />  He is very much a new agey guy (by that I mean one who<br />  has a custom belief system based on convenience). It<br />  is a good idea i think to just enjoy his movie talents<br />  and leave him at that.</p>
<p>  It is dumb to link intelligence with faith in a linear<br />  way. Newton, Edison and to some extent even Einstein<br />  was a beleiver. The math genius Ramanujam received his<br />  theories in dreams where he claimed Lord Narasimha<br />  reveled them to him. Perhaps would be more clear to<br />  say being a scientist leads one to an intelligent<br />  belief system, rather than a belief system propogated<br />  by blind following of religion.</p>
