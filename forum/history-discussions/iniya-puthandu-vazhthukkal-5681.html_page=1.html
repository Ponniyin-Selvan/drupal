<p>Just because they are in sanskrit, can we ignore it.</p>
<p>Many present popular names of Tamilnadu are sanskrit.</p>
<p>1) Karunanithi,udhaya suriyan,Ramadas are sanskrit<br />names</p>
<p>2) karthar,kirubai (Tamil christians' usage words) are<br />sanskrit. Are they not tamilians?</p>
<p>3) Tamil muslims follow arabic calendar. Their names<br />are mostly from Arabic or persian. Are they not<br />tamils?</p>
<p>Politicians make big hue and cry only incase of Hindus<br />to follow pure tamil names , tamil archanai at temples<br />and tamil marriages etc.</p>
<p>But they dare to call it for other religious groups<br />for obvious reasons</p>

<p>It may be because of not able to identify the tone. There is a <br />difference between asking a doubt without knowing the answer and <br />asking sarcastically with known answer. The level of submissiveness <br />differs. But, unfortunately, the latter uses the same tone of the <br />formar by wearing the mask of innocent. Answering the latter's <br />question in the same way it is answered to the formar will make the <br />replier fool. So, sometimes it creates confusion in understanding the <br />real intention of the person who asks the question.</p>

        <p>Instead of passing a legislation, the DMK must have declared it among<br />the party members, make them follow the new system, make all their party<br />activities linked to the new calender, test it out and then think of<br />legislation, if the idea takes off and becomes generally accepted. There<br />are so many languages and so many calenders - both religious and secular<br />practised in several parts of India; if the new calender has merit it<br />will be accepted.</p>
<p>If the calender is proposed to spite a few, it will not succeed in the<br />long run. Most people will celebrate new year on 1st chitharai, as it<br />has religious sanction, is a matter of faith and followed by many<br />regions in India.</p>

<p>Before such personalities CRITICISED certain Beliefs / mentions/ <br />customs, they FULLY read, understood and then putforward their <br />views .. say 80 to 50 years back ... !</p>
<p>And imagine the society prevailed at that point of time.</p>
<p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>Glad to know that you are not able to understand certain things in <br />Maraimalai Adigalar book. Means it has served the purpose.</p>
<p>Shall we say we close this subject.</p>

<p>    And also explain why the Tamil months are called<br />    PRABHAVA - VIBHAVA <br />    etc.</p>
<p>    regards/ sps<br />    --------------------</p></blockquote>
<p>Names of years and months.</p>
<p>All Tamil years' names are in Sanskrit. The basis for<br />this can be derived from a Narathar-Vishnu<br />mythological story. In my opinion these names and the<br />story does not serve anything thing good to society.<br />thing to trace. But these are the only points said in<br />support of changing the new year start from<br />Ciththirai. Much importance to these names are given<br />just to change the new year start in a hurried manner.<br />But there are lot other issues to be considered.</p>
<p>All thamiz month names Chiththirai to Panguni are<br />Tamil words only. These names are used in Sangam<br />literature and Tholkaappiyam. The meaning of these<br />names are simple. The month name represents the name<br />of the star appears closer to the moon on the full<br />moon day of the month. For example Chiththirai on<br />Chiththirai and Visaakam on Vaikaasi and so on. All<br />Hindu festivals come on days based on celestial events<br />only. It may be a particular phase of moon (like<br />amaavasyai, thiruthiyai, chathurththi,etc.,) or may be<br />a star ( like Thiruvaathirai, Avittam, etc.,) or may<br />be sun's movement (like Chiththirai first and Thai<br />first) . Here comes a pattern of following both sun<br />movement and moon's movement by our ancestors. </p>
<p>In India there are many regional calenders are used.<br />They are based on lunar or solar movements. Tamil<br />calender is based on solar movent system. Every month<br />represents the zodiac of sun's location. The names of<br />zodiacs mesham to meenam is the name of the month in<br />many Indian calenders. Tamilnadu govt also suggests<br />this to be followed. Govt specified the list of month<br />names as suravam, etc., are Tamil words for the zodiac<br />signs. Here is an intersting point as to why ancient<br />Tamils named the months based on moon though they<br />followed a solar based calender. This suggests that in<br />the era much before Tholkaappiyam Tamils followed some<br />calender based on moon. </p>
<p>But I believe there is a good sense to follow the<br />existing Tamil month names even today.</p>
<p>to be continued.......</p>
<p>( The forum hub link is a fantastic one. There<br />somebody suggests that the Ilavenil nowadays starts on<br />Thai and this justifies the shifting of new year<br />start. This is absolutely wrong. The proverb 'Thai<br />maathak kuLiril tharaiyum nadungum' holds very much <br />good even for centuries to come.</p>

        <p>oh god...</p>
<p>Search for 'Aryan Invasion theory a myth' in the internet and you will <br />find thousands of informations on this. The entire world except India <br />has accepted that Aryan Invassion theory is a myth and there is no race <br />as Aryan or dravidian and all the people share the same gene (if gene <br />is a scientific proof).</p>
<p>Even BBC has an article published on this. Read 'David Frawley' on this <br />subject. He has torn the theory into pieces. Even the people who came <br />up with this theory has called it as 'Aryan Invasion THEORY' meaning <br />its was just a theory and not proven. Even Max Muller, who proposed <br />this theory has said that its just his theory and there is no concrete <br />proof for it. Probably, he proposed the theory alound in the mic and <br />covered the mic when the said the second half (like Krishna sounding <br />the sangu when Dharma said about Ashwathama's death to Drona :) ) (pun <br />intended)</p>
<p>Gandhi, Vivekanada, Arobindo and many more of that era has phoophooed <br />this theory, even before the westerners accepted their mistake. </p>
<p>Just one logical question from my side. If Dravidan is a derivation of <br />the word 'Tamilar' - tramilar - dravidar - then what about the people <br />of other states? As per this theory except Brahmins, all the people of <br />India are Dravidar. Then why so many languages came into existence. It <br />should have been Tamil through out the country, if all non-brahmins are <br />Dravidar. </p>
<p>Another one - Ramayan is interpreted as the fight between Aryans and <br />the dravidians. Arya - Brahmin, Dravidian - Non Brahmin. But people who <br />proposed this failed to take note that Rama was a non brahmin and <br />Ravana was a brahmin. So do they mean to say that the dravidian <br />defeated aryan?</p>
<p>Evne <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group archives has a lot of info on this. <br />As I said, even the foreign historians have accepted that the history <br />of India is not as it was thought so far, we Indians do not (or will <br />not) accept it, because its a matter of convineince rather than fact.<br />If the fact that the theory is a myth is taken, then they cannot <br />bash....OOOPSSs. let me stop here.</acronym></p>

        <p>KG, I dont' wish to discuss anything more either. But<br />i want to reiterate what I said - Kalaigner or<br />Periyar's criticism of the Ramayana is not literary<br />criticism, it is trashing and deliberately degrading a<br />story in vengeaful manner. Literary criticism is<br />unbiased and impartial, it will acknowledge good and<br />bad in the story. </p>
<p>Kalignar is very knowledgeful as far as Tamil goes.<br />He has not ever known to be highly profienct in any<br />other language. Granted, he read tamil translation of<br />Valmiki. Anyone who reads valmiki ramayana or its<br />translation are very impressed by the poetic beauty,<br />the purity and simple honesty of characters - I know<br />personally of westerners who have no religious<br />affiliation to be impressed by the Ramayana. If he<br />wants to read 6 versions or 600 versions for trashing<br />the book there is really no point - matter of fact you<br />dont have to read at all for that, just do what MR<br />Radha did , go on stage and bad mouth the book to your<br />heart's content.</p>
<p>Yes a belief system can be harmful, and religious and<br />casteist dogma has harmed many many people. But<br />reiterating the way these people did is not any<br />solution. That is exactly why Gandhi himself did not<br />support EVR - Gandhi's firm stance was to avoid hate<br />and do away with the 'eye for an eye' approach.</p>
<p>I am saying all this so passionately because - I quit<br />an engineeering seat, a prestigious one for someone<br />from a lower middle class family in recognition of<br />reservations and what injustice has been done by way<br />of casteism. My father came close to death in labor<br />riots for supporting his DK lead workers. We never had<br />any caste barriers in my house since 4 generations<br />ago, often times that meant like Kalki wrote -<br />attracting the antagonism of people in our own<br />community and family.</p>
<p>I dont' appreciate being labelled 'muttaal' or not<br />being accepted as a tamilian after all this.</p>
<p>Thank you and will stop here.</p>

<p>    They read the tamil version of<br />    Ramayana that Kambar wrote, which is a great<br />  literary<br />    work but suited to Kambar's times.</p>
<p>  No. Kalaignar said in an interview to NDTV (or<br />  CNN-IBN?) that he has <br />  read 6 ramayanas including Valmiki's.</p>
<p>    Very simply put, you have a right to say kadavul<br />    illai. You have NO BUSINESS whatsoever to say<br />    kadavulai nambubavam muttaal. Really none. That is<br />  the<br />    essence of the problem we are having and continue<br />  to<br />    have in many many ways.</p>
<p>    I can and will accept what Periyar/Anna/Kalaignar<br />  did<br />    for Tamils. I expect the same type of respect and<br />    understanding for my own beliefs, including my<br />  belief<br />    in God, whether it makes sense to the ohter person<br />  or<br />    not. </p>
<p>  Others have NO BUSINESS with your belief as long as<br />  it is with you. <br />  But when the belief takes a form which cause harm to<br />  other people, <br />  others get right to question your belief.

<p>Others have NO BUSINESS with your belief as long as it is with you. <br />But when the belief takes a form which cause harm to other people, <br />others get right to question your belief.

<p>something, no one tries to clarify and make me understand, but downpour <br />with trashings pulling out unwanted things. Whenever such topics come, <br />I have seen that even people who dont go with DK's principles accept <br />and appreciate what the DK leaders have done, except for the religious <br />bashing (which you have rightly put - give respect take respect). But <br />on the other hand the DK supporters blindly trash the other end without <br />even appreciating the goods that have been done.</p>

<p>      My Tamil Professor Dr.SATHIYA SEELAN (tamil) is a<br />    Living Legend ..</p>
<p>      Kavipperasu is my very good friend...</p>
<p>      There are Scholarly Professors very good at Tamil<br />    language ..</p>

<p>          When the TN Government announced that the<br />    tamil New Year begins<br />      from<br />          Tamil month " Thai first " (which announcement<br />    is already 3<br />      month<br />          old) Where is the question of protesting that<br />    now?<br />      =========================   </p>

<p>        The question is not just changing the new year<br />    from chitirai 1 to<br />      thai<br />        1. I too read about it a few months back. These<br />    are obvious<br />      political<br />        stunts and people are not bothered about it.<br />    Even now, the whole<br />      state<br />        will be celebrating the new year only on<br />    chitirai 1 and not on<br />      thai 1.</p>
<p>        But I got wild when I heard that the panchangam<br />    reading was<br />    banned<br />      in<br />        the temples. This is what I called atrocious.</p>
<p>        Reposting my question - 'if the govt. is so<br />    strong in celebrating<br />      only<br />        thai 1 as new year and can ban panchangam<br />    reading in temples on<br />        chitirai 1, can the pass an order to stop the<br />    new prayers in the<br />        churches on Jan 1?'</p>
<p>        My protest was only for the religious<br />    intervention of the state<br />      when<br />        they call themselves secular. Secular actually<br />    means govt. keeping<br />        away from religion and not treating all religion<br />    equal. Forget<br />      equal<br />        treatment, in India seulcar alwasy means<br />    pro-minority...</p>

        <p>SPS (and everyone), I realize it is a sensitive<br />subject. We have many years of pain and anger<br />regarding these issues and it is only natural it comes<br />up when we talk. Also as human beings it is very hard<br />to be balanced and completely dispassionate , most<br />people tend to swing one way or the other completely<br />and honestly put there are problems on both sides,<br />huge problems.</p>
<p>SPS I would correct what you said a little, one should<br />read and understand more not just on Periyar, Anna and<br />Kalignar, but on *anyone* we choose to comment or<br />develop strong feelings around. That applies to<br />dravidians as much as to 'others' (if that is a<br />classification we want to keep). Someone mentioned<br />that Periyar, Anna were well read on Ramayana.<br />Completley false. They read the tamil version of<br />Ramayana that Kambar wrote, which is a great literary<br />work but suited to Kambar's times. Kambar made several<br />alterations to it, respectfuly of course, but one<br />cannot comment on Ramayana reading his work alone. One<br />cannot also comment on any book with a vindictive<br />mindset, like I want to trash this is very differnt<br />from a healthy criticism, which was very absent in the<br />DK's treatment of the Ramayana. </p>
<p>Very simply put, you have a right to say kadavul<br />illai. You have NO BUSINESS whatsoever to say<br />kadavulai nambubavam muttaal. Really none. That is the<br />essence of the problem we are having and continue to<br />have in many many ways.</p>
<p>I can and will accept what Periyar/Anna/Kalaignar did<br />for Tamils. I expect the same type of respect and<br />understanding for my own beliefs, including my belief<br />in God, whether it makes sense to the ohter person or<br />not. I don't appreciate being labelled 'muttaal' for<br />my belief system. It is matter of fact this fear of<br />being insulted that keeps many thinking upper caste<br />people from even seeing what is good in all that these<br />leaders did.</p>
<p>An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind, unless<br />we realize to give and take respect this battle will<br />continue forever. Noone is responsible for what our<br />ancestors did, we cannot really cure history by over<br />compensating one way or the other. We can only start<br />from zero, and a place of real merit, mutual regard<br />and self esteem.</p>

        <p>Since I could not lay my hands on any of the information pertaining to<br />the basis of Jan 14 being tamil new year (again i should admit I might<br />not be doing a good search), I started searching for Maraimalai<br />adigal, since he was one of the key person in the 1921 convention.</p>
<p>Not much I could get, but came across an interesting book by Sumathi<br />ramaswamy, titled 'Passion of the Tongue - Language Devotion in Tamil<br />India, 1891?1970' published in the year 1997. This book is available<br />in the link below -</p>
<p><a href="http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol" title="http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol">http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;brand=eschol</a></p>
<p>I didnt go through the entire book, but a quick scan on a few pages, i<br />got something. I should admit, my understanding could be totally wrong<br />or I would have missed the context. Scholars in this group can correct me.</p>
<p>- The need for Tamil Passion came as an offshoot of religious<br />fundamentalism. If I understand right, anti-brahminism<br />- Indian National Congress was full of active brahmins and the<br />non-brahmin community feared this prosperity of brahmins.<br />- To alienate the brahmins or the aryan influence, a need was felt to<br />come out with a Tamil based culture - glorifying Tamil, calling tamil<br />as 'Taniththamizh' (without mix of Sanskrit), 'theivath thamizh'<br />taking the language to godliness.<br />- This continued to the movement to clear tamil of other langauge mix,<br />like english, sanskrit and persian (?) and make the tamil language<br />pure. Thats when pure tamil movement was started<br />- Many stalwarts including Maraimalai adigal were part of this<br />movement. they were not atheist but said that siva is a tamil god and<br />not a aryan god. This gave raise to the Saiva sidhantham. later<br />Periya, Anna et al are said to have adopted this thani tamil<br />ideology.This gave raise to the draidian movement. (but I am not sure<br />how the atheism came in)</p>
<p>Good to know that Maraimalai adigal has published nearly 54 books,<br />both in english and tamil.</p>
<p>Someon said that only mylapore ,mambalam people accepted aryan theory<br />and this book says that the non-brahmins of tamil nadu wanted to<br />alienate brahmins who are aryans. I am totally confused :( manda<br />kayuthu...</p>
<p>The best part is - The tamil purist said tamil has a religion of their<br />own and a person is considered a 'Tamilan' only if his uyir porul aavi<br />is tamil. They also add that people who came from outside with tamil<br />not as their mother tongue, and still love tamil, they are also<br />tamilan. Whoever wishes to learn and love tamil is also 'tamilan'.</p>
<p>BUT....tamil brahmins are not tamilan!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>The move was unanimously passed in the Tamilnadu State<br />assembly. There is red fear gripping all over<br />Tamilnadu to talk anything about Tamil sentiments. No<br />politician is exempted from this. In spite of this<br />situation BJP and allied parties expressed their<br />bitter feelings. But their expressions will be<br />foofooed for their reputation on religious grounds.<br />Thinamani and Thinamalar have published articles<br />loaded with scientific facts. But how many read<br />Thinamani? And Thinamalar is considered to be pro-BJP.<br />Thuklak registered their objections. But Thuklak is<br />anti-DMK.</p>
<p>Every household in my relative circle just ignored<br />this order and they are too busy to care this not even<br />as a political move. I had divided friends' circle on<br />this issue and as expected who are all supporting the<br />shifting of Tamil new year day are loyal to Dravidan<br />principles. They have very vigorously quoted the<br />Narathar-Vishnu story and Sanskrit names of the years<br />to discard the Chiththirai New year.</p>
<p>Viko recorded his protests citing Sangam literature<br />evidences and climate changes during this season.</p>
<p>Tamil New year was celebrated by all who used to<br />celebrate it regularly. All temples are flooded and<br />regular Poojaas conducted. Trchy Samayapuram temple<br />had about a lakh of people on that day morning around<br />7 AM. In spite some news about informal govt orders<br />not to perform special poojas and not to read<br />Panjangam, things went in very much normal way.</p>
<p>TV channels named this day as CHiththirai thirunaal<br />either to obey the govt order or to avoid legal<br />action.</p>
<p>To summarise the protests my protests are to be<br />included which is really very strong.</p>
<p>sn.</p>
<p>(PRABHAVA - VIBHAVA are names of the years and not<br />months. I think there is a typo here. About these<br />names I donot know much. But let me wirite what I know<br />in the next mail)</p>

        <p>Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Yes. It is common sense to open a new year with spring<br />season. This is a great thing about Tamil new year day<br />which has been fixed on mid April based on scintific,<br />psycholgical, economical and historical factors.<br />Ancient Indians and in particuler Tamil people are<br />very good at astronomy. If we are not misguided by<br />mytholgical stories then we have lots and lots to<br />wonder about their expertise.</p>
<p>I would summerise the facts I know to the group soon.</p>

<p>  the english new year too at some point of time was<br />  in april but with <br />  adoption of the gregorian calender(??) changed. that<br />  has something to <br />  do with the april fools day i have read.</p>

<p>      The question is not just changing the new year<br />  from chitirai 1 to <br />    thai<br />      1. I too read about it a few months back. These<br />  are obvious <br />    political<br />      stunts and people are not bothered about it.<br />  Even now, the whole <br />    state<br />      will be celebrating the new year only on<br />  chitirai 1 and not on <br />    thai 1. </p>
<p>      But I got wild when I heard that the panchangam<br />  reading was <br />  banned <br />    in<br />      the temples. This is what I called atrocious.</p>
<p>      Reposting my question - 'if the govt. is so<br />  strong in celebrating <br />    only<br />      thai 1 as new year and can ban panchangam<br />  reading in temples on<br />      chitirai 1, can the pass an order to stop the<br />  new prayers in the<br />      churches on Jan 1?'</p>
<p>      My protest was only for the religious<br />  intervention of the state <br />    when<br />      they call themselves secular. Secular actually<br />  means govt. keeping<br />      away from religion and not treating all religion<br />  equal. Forget <br />    equal<br />      treatment, in India seulcar alwasy means<br />  pro-minority...</p>
<p>      Yes, our backbone has been broken long ago and<br />  only god can save <br />    this<br />      country.</p>

        <p>Hi Satish,</p>
<p>How are you? Settled down in the US?</p>
<p>In "The Hub" one guy has posted an explanation for the<br />Jan 14 issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://forumhub.mayyam.com/hub/viewtopic.php?p=294389&amp;sid=0bc9d88d5de439d8e8e1edb067723312#294389" title="http://forumhub.mayyam.com/hub/viewtopic.php?p=294389&amp;sid=0bc9d88d5de439d8e8e1edb067723312#294389">http://forumhub.mayyam.com/hub/viewtopic.php?p=294389&amp;sid=0bc9d88d5de439...</a></p>
<p>It seems the Sun entered Aries in Jan 14 in ancient<br />times and that marked the beginning of the year. Due<br />to shift of celestial bodies over millennia this got<br />moved to April.</p>
<p>The year names are Sanskrit though. I haven't come<br />across a Tamil version yet. Whether the names are<br />Tamil or Sanskrit, it doesnt matter as long as the<br />system is accurate.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. I'm no scholar on this!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Sorry VK. I am not able to get your point.</p>
<p>  the first link you gave, I also came across this,<br />  but that article<br />  speaks about the logic of having April 14th as the<br />  new year and not<br />  Jan 14th. Only the last lines says that some people<br />  claim Thai 1 as<br />  new year and nothing more than that. Am I missing<br />  something?</p>
<p>  I am not sure about the Tamil names of the months,<br />  as these do not<br />  sound too Sanskritic. But as SPS pointed, the year<br />  names are surely<br />  Sanskrit. </p>
<p>  Again, the question is not yet answered (and I<br />  cannot accept your<br />  words that the link you provided gives scientific<br />  explanation for<br />  Jan14 as Tamil new year) - What is the basis for<br />  saying Jan 14 is the<br />  Tamil New year?</p>

<p>    Dear SPS,</p>
<p>    I searched the net and found some content which<br />    discuss the Tamil Calender in detail and some of<br />  them<br />    give a scientific explanation why it should be Jan<br />  14.<br />    See:</p>
<p>  <a href="http://forumhub.mayyam.com/hub/viewtopic.php?t=1767" title="http://forumhub.mayyam.com/hub/viewtopic.php?t=1767">http://forumhub.mayyam.com/hub/viewtopic.php?t=1767</a></p>
<p>    ..and it seems there are proper Tamil names for<br />  the<br />    months ( look for Suravam, Kumbam, Mezham etc.,<br />    somewhere in the middle of the page):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ambimama.com/2006/11/18/makkal-tv-creates-sensation/feed/" title="http://www.ambimama.com/2006/11/18/makkal-tv-creates-sensation/feed/">http://www.ambimama.com/2006/11/18/makkal-tv-creates-sensation/feed/</a></p>
<p>    Somebody mentions that these Tamil names are<br />  common in<br />    Malaysian Calenders. Some also try to explain in<br />    scientific terms why the Tamil months have<br />  different<br />    number of days.</p></vkasirajan@...></p></blockquote>

        <p>Hi<br />the most famous person to contradict " mahakavi" for barathi <br />is.....................</p>
<p>KALKI</p>
<p>one of greatest contreversies surounding kalki was his lengthy <br />arguments with va. ra on honouring barathi.<br />kalki was a great fan of barathi no doubt. but he has gone on print  <br />saying he doesnt beleive barathi is a mahakavi.<br />i think he was comparing barathi with tagore.<br />for some reason tagore fascinated kalki'<br />even in college days he paid a princely amount of 5 rupees which was <br />50% of his mothly allowance just to see tagore. <br />of course he later wrote "tagore darisanam" and made up the five <br />rupees( joking)</p>

<p>    Dravidian parties not quoting Bharathi is not at all true. I can <br />  show <br />    lot of examples.

If not, go to Anna arivalayam and <br />  see <br />    that poem kept in the museum. You can see the reference to <br />  Bharathi <br />    in that. The best example is Kalaignar's Paraasakthi. The *SAME* <br />  song <br />    which you have quoted is there.

<p>Venkat is right. Caste issue did not eclipse Bharathi.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a feeling every conversation leads o the aryan dravidian <br />divide.</p>
<p>first my opinion on bharathi.<br />i dont think he was mistreated because he was a bramhin. </p>
<p>if that was the case his memories would have been erased in favour of <br />the dravidian poets.<br />i dont even know how some of these dravidian poets looked like.<br />bharathi's memories have been well nurtured.<br />i think instead of discussing about bharathi's caste( which he <br />himself wouldnt have liked) we have so many factors in his writings <br />and life to discuss.the recent one is something our group hasnt even <br />touched i feel sorry to say.)<br />the discovery of bharathi's letters to 'the hindu' in english.<br />vijay, can you post some details on that from the hindu.</p>
<p>i hope members will keep away from these topics that hinder a smooth <br />flow.<br />its not that we shouldnt discuss them but when we do sudeenly there <br />is a lot of anger and for a week or so nobody writes.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Someone wrote about Bharati not getting<br />  enough respect( or no respect). That is <br />  very true and strongly a caste issue.</p>
<p>  no Dravida katchi quotes him and they <br />  quote only Bharathidasan,</p></blockquote>
<p>Dravidian parties not quoting Bharathi is not at all true. I can show <br />lot of examples. Even many writers who support dravidian movements <br />wrote many books on Bharathi. Have you ever read Kalaignar's kavithai <br />written during Anna's funeral? If not, go to Anna arivalayam and see <br />that poem kept in the museum.

People criticising Bharathi just <br />because of his cast is very minimal, which happens for every other <br />leader.</p>
<p>Its true that Caste played with Bharathi. But it was during his time. <br />He was ill-treated by his own caste people. Things are much better <br />and he is well recognised now. His songs made popularised, His <br />birthday celebrated, A university in his name, A memorial house, <br />Frequently remembered by people and scholars and what not? Can you <br />list what else could have been done in Bharathi's case which other <br />leaders are enjoying? Instead of just telling not there, not there, <br />please tell what should have been done.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Today we need a second freedom from<br />  enemies within...corruption , caste <br />  based politics, indiscipline etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Correct. Kindly include religion based politics too.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Again, thinking of the situation, when<br />  the whole world has accepted <br />  that the aryan invasion theory is a<br />  myth and there are not seperate <br />  race as Aryans, we dont change<br />  ourselves and still stick to it.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is called as Sandhula sindhu paadaradhu!!! Which world accepted <br />the invasion theory, satish? The world in Mambalam, Mylapore, <br />Nanganallur and Madippakkam? Come on, there is something beyond <br />that!!!</p>
<blockquote><p>  Its ATROCIOUS to intervene in religious<br />  belief just to satisfy and get vote from a few.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldnt understand how will it get vote and who will vote for this <br />change?</p>
<blockquote><p>  Primarily I suggest one should read<br />  and understand more about Arignar<br />  Anna, Periyar and Kalignar - before<br />  uttering anything negative....<br />  I will stop here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perfect SPS!!! Well said. Periyar, Anna and Kalaignar read Ramayana <br />and other epics before they criticise. But these Dravidian movement <br />bashers fail to do that.</p>

        <p>SPs, interesting post on Kalignar. When you find time<br />could you really write more on his literary<br />accomplishments.</p>
<p>I don't have any political affiliations one way or the<br />other myself but I have seen this deep rooted, long<br />standing rivalry between 'upper castes' and 'others'<br />in TN that takes form in many ways. </p>
<p>enough respect( or no respect). That is very true and<br />strongly a caste issue. Rajaji is almost a forgotten<br />almost everyone who has or had DK affiliations are<br />hated with a vengeance among upper castes, regardless<br />of their individual contribution. I was at a family<br />reunion once and pointed out Periyaar's contribution<br />to women's rights, I was lucky put it mildly to escape<br />alive. Singers like MSS take great efforts to blend<br />with brahmin society, MSS even changed her pure tamil<br />madurai diction to a brahmin diction prounoucing all<br />'sa' as 'sha' and so on.</p>
<p>Casteism marches on in one form or the other. Unless<br />we learn to recognize every human being as human<br />without their background prejudice we will never make<br />progress as a country.</p>

<p>      Dear Members,</p>
<p>      When the TN Government announced that the tamil<br />  New Year begins <br />    from <br />      Tamil month " Thai first " (which announcement<br />  is already 3 <br />  month <br />      old) Where is the question of protesting that<br />  now?</p>
<p>      When Media - particulary TV Channels with Mass<br />  viewership also <br />      used " Chithirai pirappu " and things like that<br />  we can also <br />  record <br />      our views here and be done with it ...</p>
<p>      Since the topic is discussed my view is :</p>
<p>      SARVAJITH was last Tamil New Year ..</p>
<p>      IN this word SARVA is NOT TAMIL DICTION. JITH<br />  too.</p>
<p>      This Year is SARVA DHARI ... Again same thing.</p>
<p>      When did this 60 year NAMING OF TAMIL YEARS<br />  occur ?<br />      who did ? when commenced ?<br />      How commended from Chithirai ?</p>
<p>      Why TN Government is telling this to be computed<br />  from " Thai" ?</p>
<p>      With these concrete points made available for<br />  discussion we can <br />    put <br />      forward our views .. instead of mentioning<br />  specific names / <br />      parties / races.</p>
<p>      Vaazhthukkal,</p>

        <p>Sorry VK. I am not able to get your point.</p>
<p>the first link you gave, I also came across this, but that article<br />speaks about the logic of having April 14th as the new year and not<br />Jan 14th. Only the last lines says that some people claim Thai 1 as<br />new year and nothing more than that. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>I am not sure about the Tamil names of the months, as these do not<br />sound too Sanskritic. But as SPS pointed, the year names are surely<br />Sanskrit. </p>
<p>Again, the question is not yet answered (and I cannot accept your<br />words that the link you provided gives scientific explanation for<br />Jan14 as Tamil new year) - What is the basis for saying Jan 14 is the<br />Tamil New year?</p>

<blockquote><p>  SPS,</p>
<p>  Your questions are thought provoking. I tried searching on the net <br />(I<br />  really envied Vijay, how he gets accurate data? I am very poor in<br />  searching). The points I could gather were:</p>
<p>  1. In 1921 around 500 scholars under the lead of Maraimalai <br />adigalar,<br />  met at Pachaiyappan college and came to the conclusion that Thai 1<br />  should be the tamil new year.<br />  2. Tiruvlluvar was born 31 years before christ and hence the<br />  Tiruvalluvar andu was taken as the official Tamil Year.</p>
<p>  Except this I couldnt gather much.</p>
<p>  We have discussed in length about deducing historical events. But<br />  these points dont fit in that realm.</p>
<p>  Lot of open ended questions :</p>
<p>  1. who were those 500 scholars?<br />  2. what were the facts based on which they concluded that Thai 1 is<br />  the tamil new year?<br />  3. How come they know that Tiruvalluvar was born 31 years before<br />  christ? Even the birth year of christ is not yet confirmed, there is<br />  no evident proof for the year of his birth. some say 1 AD commenced <br />4<br />  years after Christ was born, so and so forth. And also no one knows<br />  when Tiruvalluvar lived and how come they are sure that he was born <br />31<br />  years before Christ?</p>
<p>  As Venkatesh rightly pointed out, most of the new years start during<br />  the spring. If i am correct, the Indira vizha of sangam literature <br />is<br />  a spring festival and should be around this period. Probably the new<br />  year was celebrated as Indira vizha. Human minds think alike and the<br />  new year falling between March and April around the world (i think<br />  most)is a proof for this. </p>
<p>  One thing I am happy about is - I started the thread with the <br />feeling<br />  that no one dared to wish puthandu vazhtu and every one changed to<br />  chitirai tirunal vazhthu. But now this thread with the subject line<br />  repeatedly say 'Iniya puthandu vazhthukkal'.No one changed the <br />subject<br />  line :)</p>
<p>  Venkat, Its news to me that LR Eswari is Lourde Rajeswari. How come<br />  you know so much trivia? Surprising, as you say the stroke of the <br />lord.</p>

<p>..and it seems there are proper Tamil names for the<br />months ( look for Suravam, Kumbam, Mezham etc.,<br />somewhere in the middle of the page):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ambimama.com/2006/11/18/makkal-tv-creates-sensation/feed/" title="http://www.ambimama.com/2006/11/18/makkal-tv-creates-sensation/feed/">http://www.ambimama.com/2006/11/18/makkal-tv-creates-sensation/feed/</a></p>
<p>Somebody mentions that these Tamil names are common in<br />Malaysian Calenders. Some also try to explain in<br />scientific terms why the Tamil months have different<br />number of days.</p>
<p>Needs more research to assert the facts! Somebody good<br />in astronomy can establish the facts with proper<br />mathematics and observational data.</p>
<p>Thanks and best regards,</p>

<p>  This date is commenced as Thiruvalluvar Year<br />  commencement date.</p>

<p>  1. Why the Nomenclatures of the Tamil months remain<br />  in alien-to <br />  Tamil language.</p>
<p>  2. When the system started.</p>
<p>  To the Second query :</p>
<p>  We have seen from inscriptions that the Year / Tamil<br />  year was <br />  related to Ruling Kings' Ascendancy date..</p>
<p>  Here there is another interpretation :</p>
<p>  Aandu and Yaandu (Kudanthai Sethuraman).</p>

<p>  Kollam of Malayalam Calender commenced behind<br />  Christian Era and some <br />  were in the 7th Century or so.</p>
<p>  Likewise Thiruvallurvarandu is also calculated <br />  based on certain <br />  data.</p>
<p>  TN Government announced commencement of<br />  Thiruvalluvar aandu as the <br />  official Tamil New Year...</p>
<p>  Dear Venkateswaran,'</p>

        <p>SPS,</p>
<p>Your questions are thought provoking. I tried searching on the net (I<br />really envied Vijay, how he gets accurate data? I am very poor in<br />searching). The points I could gather were:</p>
<p>1. In 1921 around 500 scholars under the lead of Maraimalai adigalar,<br />met at Pachaiyappan college and came to the conclusion that Thai 1<br />should be the tamil new year.<br />2. Tiruvlluvar was born 31 years before christ and hence the<br />Tiruvalluvar andu was taken as the official Tamil Year.</p>
<p>Except this I couldnt gather much.</p>
<p>We have discussed in length about deducing historical events. But<br />these points dont fit in that realm.</p>
<p>Lot of open ended questions :</p>
<p>1. who were those 500 scholars?<br />2. what were the facts based on which they concluded that Thai 1 is<br />the tamil new year?<br />3. How come they know that Tiruvalluvar was born 31 years before<br />christ? Even the birth year of christ is not yet confirmed, there is<br />no evident proof for the year of his birth. some say 1 AD commenced 4<br />years after Christ was born, so and so forth. And also no one knows<br />when Tiruvalluvar lived and how come they are sure that he was born 31<br />years before Christ?</p>
<p>As Venkatesh rightly pointed out, most of the new years start during<br />the spring. If i am correct, the Indira vizha of sangam literature is<br />a spring festival and should be around this period. Probably the new<br />year was celebrated as Indira vizha. Human minds think alike and the<br />new year falling between March and April around the world (i think<br />most)is a proof for this. </p>
<p>One thing I am happy about is - I started the thread with the feeling<br />that no one dared to wish puthandu vazhtu and every one changed to<br />chitirai tirunal vazhthu. But now this thread with the subject line<br />repeatedly say 'Iniya puthandu vazhthukkal'.No one changed the subject<br />line :)</p>
<p>Venkat, Its news to me that LR Eswari is Lourde Rajeswari. How come<br />you know so much trivia? Surprising, as you say the stroke of the lord.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

<p>      Dear Members,</p>
<p>      When the TN Government announced that the tamil New Year begins <br />  from <br />      Tamil month " Thai first " (which announcement is already 3 <br />  month <br />      old) Where is the question of protesting that now?<br />  =========================   </p>

<p>    The question is not just changing the new year from chitirai 1 to <br />  thai<br />    1. I too read about it a few months back. These are obvious <br />  political<br />    stunts and people are not bothered about it. Even now, the whole <br />  state<br />    will be celebrating the new year only on chitirai 1 and not on <br />  thai 1. </p>
<p>    But I got wild when I heard that the panchangam reading was <br />banned <br />  in<br />    the temples. This is what I called atrocious.</p>
<p>    Reposting my question - 'if the govt. is so strong in celebrating <br />  only<br />    thai 1 as new year and can ban panchangam reading in temples on<br />    chitirai 1, can the pass an order to stop the new prayers in the<br />    churches on Jan 1?'</p>
<p>    My protest was only for the religious intervention of the state <br />  when<br />    they call themselves secular. Secular actually means govt. keeping<br />    away from religion and not treating all religion equal. Forget <br />  equal<br />    treatment, in India seulcar alwasy means pro-minority...</p>
<p>    Yes, our backbone has been broken long ago and only god can save <br />  this<br />    country.</p>

<p>Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>what Satish is asking "On what Grounds the date changed from April <br />15th to Jan 15th..</p>
<p>since no direct answer came so far, I mention :</p>
<p>This date is commenced as Thiruvalluvar Year commencement date.</p>
<p>But there are several quries unanswered :</p>
<p>1. Why the Nomenclatures of the Tamil months remain in alien-to <br />Tamil language.</p>
<p>2. When the system started.</p>
<p>To the Second query :</p>
<p>We have seen from inscriptions that the Year / Tamil year was <br />related to Ruling Kings' Ascendancy date..</p>
<p>Here there is another interpretation :</p>
<p>Aandu and Yaandu (Kudanthai Sethuraman).</p>
<p>Hijri - current 1429.</p>
<p>Kollam of Malayalam Calender commenced behind Christian Era and some <br />were in the 7th Century or so.</p>
<p>Likewise Thiruvallurvarandu is also calculated based on certain <br />data.</p>
<p>TN Government announced commencement of Thiruvalluvar aandu as the <br />official Tamil New Year...</p>
<p>Dear Venkateswaran,'</p>
<p>In the light of these when we read the Dinamani article, we realise <br />that even Commencement dates for these calenders are not FIXED / <br />ABSOLUTE.</p>

<p>    Dear Members,</p>
<p>    When the TN Government announced that the tamil<br />  New Year begins <br />  from <br />    Tamil month " Thai first " (which announcement is<br />  already 3 month <br />    old) Where is the question of protesting that now?</p>
<p>    When Media - particulary TV Channels with Mass<br />  viewership also <br />    used " Chithirai pirappu " and things like that we<br />  can also record <br />    our views here and be done with it ...</p>
<p>    Since the topic is discussed my view is :</p>
<p>    SARVAJITH was last Tamil New Year ..</p>
<p>    IN this word SARVA is NOT TAMIL DICTION. JITH too.</p>
<p>    This Year is SARVA DHARI ... Again same thing.</p>
<p>    When did this 60 year NAMING OF TAMIL YEARS occur<br />  ?<br />    who did ? when commenced ?<br />    How commended from Chithirai ?</p>
<p>    Why TN Government is telling this to be computed<br />  from " Thai" ?</p>
<p>    With these concrete points made available for<br />  discussion we can <br />  put <br />    forward our views .. instead of mentioning<br />  specific names / <br />    parties / races.</p>
<p>    Vaazhthukkal,</p>

If <br />  people <br />    say <br />      that this group is not the place to discuss<br />  this...I beg to <br />    differ. <br />      This is certainly in our groups purview. When we<br />  say we are <br />  trying <br />    to <br />      protect our culture and history, is this not a<br />  big hit to our <br />      culture?//</p>
<p>      I agree with you Satish. There should have been<br />  some protests. <br />  But <br />      nothing. Why? Tamilian's backbone is already<br />  broken.</p>
<p>      When our temple sculptures were painted with oil<br />  paints and made <br />    our <br />      goddess look like a bar girl with mini skirt, we<br />  did not protest.</p>
<p>      When pillaiyaar was given AK47 and military<br />  dress during <br />  vinayakar <br />      chadhurthi, our blood did not boil.</p>
<p>      When temples were destroyed and bathroom tiles<br />  were fixed inside <br />    the <br />      sanctum in the name of renovation, our nenju<br />  poruththadhu.</p>
<p>      When governments murdered their citizens in the<br />  name of <br />  religion, <br />    we <br />      didnt have guts to raise the voice.</p>
<p>      When government intervened in the culture of<br />  siru dheyva <br />    vazhipaadu, <br />      we least bothered about that.</p>
<p>      When mutts involved in murder cases, we<br />  convinced ourselves as <br />      political tit-for-tat.</p>
<p>      When school students were forced to sing<br />  saraswati vandhanam, we <br />      tried to justify that saraswati is common to<br />  everyone.</p>
<p>      Then, how can you expect such boneless creatures<br />  to react only <br />  for <br />      this? Just because we are programmed to<br />  attribute bad things to <br />    DMK <br />      and find faults only in Dravidian parties?</p>

<p>Hi sir,</p></blockquote>
<p>Not sure we discussed this before, but of all the <br />temples/gopurams/monuments photographed - i think the shore temple has <br />a uniqueness about it - its got a peculiar charm - whether shot in <br />stilloutte or in light - despite it being worn down, its got a certain <br />asthetics to it. from any angle, from any side - in any light, its got <br />a certain mesmerising charm. the twin irregular towers seem to have <br />some divine symmetry that is pleasing to our eyes</p>

        <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>this morning while watching the news item in Kalignar TV, just <br />dawned:</p>
<p>THE BIG TEMPLE (Photo ) is Prominent behind a News Reader.</p>
<p>MALLAI SHORE TEMPLE (photo) is Prominent behind another News Reader.</p>
<p>Not that I have political affliations ..</p>
<p>Dr. Kalaignar recently wrote ::</p>

<p>ARUGAMAIYIL :: Distantly</p>
<p>Inspite of me repeatedly drawing attention, the PRESS is using <br />ARUGAMIYIL to denote nearby.</p>
<p>MUNNAL (Former) is another word...</p>
<p>When said Munnal Minister it leads to (Late) minister. One should <br />be careful in such usage .... "</p>
<p>Read our Archives. He picked a copy of Kavirimaindhan (Sequel to <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ) from Venkat's (Author) stall in 2007 Chennai Book Fair.</p>
<p>His love and respect for Kalki is well pronounced..</p>
<p>Being Kalki fans, fascinated by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  (Ancient Tamil Kings') Rule, <br />cherishing (UNESCO) monuments and promoting cause of Classical Tamil <br />language, WE - being PRIMARILY A LITERARY FORUM - we have more <br />reasons to acknowledge the accomplishments of Dr. Kalaignar.</acronym></p>
<p>We can put forward contrary views too, with supportings in a polite <br />and dignified way ...</p>

<p>    Dear Members,</p>
<p>    When the TN Government announced that the tamil New Year begins <br />  from <br />    Tamil month " Thai first " (which announcement is already 3 <br />month <br />    old) Where is the question of protesting that now?</p>
<p>    When Media - particulary TV Channels with Mass viewership also <br />    used " Chithirai pirappu " and things like that we can also <br />record <br />    our views here and be done with it ...</p>
<p>    Since the topic is discussed my view is :</p>
<p>    SARVAJITH was last Tamil New Year ..</p>
<p>    IN this word SARVA is NOT TAMIL DICTION. JITH too.</p>
<p>    This Year is SARVA DHARI ... Again same thing.</p>
<p>    When did this 60 year NAMING OF TAMIL YEARS occur ?<br />    who did ? when commenced ?<br />    How commended from Chithirai ?</p>
<p>    Why TN Government is telling this to be computed from " Thai" ?</p>
<p>    With these concrete points made available for discussion we can <br />  put <br />    forward our views .. instead of mentioning specific names / <br />    parties / races.</p>
<p>    Vaazhthukkal,</p>
<p>    sps </p>

When we say we are <br />  trying <br />    to <br />      protect our culture and history, is this not a big hit to our <br />      culture?//</p>
<p>      I agree with you Satish. There should have been some protests. <br />  But <br />      nothing. Why? Tamilian's backbone is already broken.</p>
<p>      When our temple sculptures were painted with oil paints and <br />made <br />    our <br />      goddess look like a bar girl with mini skirt, we did not <br />protest.</p>
<p>      When pillaiyaar was given AK47 and military dress during <br />  vinayakar <br />      chadhurthi, our blood did not boil.</p>
<p>      When temples were destroyed and bathroom tiles were fixed <br />inside <br />    the <br />      sanctum in the name of renovation, our nenju poruththadhu.</p>
<p>      When governments murdered their citizens in the name of <br />  religion, <br />    we <br />      didnt have guts to raise the voice.</p>
<p>      When government intervened in the culture of siru dheyva <br />    vazhipaadu, <br />      we least bothered about that.</p>
<p>      When mutts involved in murder cases, we convinced ourselves as <br />      political tit-for-tat.</p>
<p>      When school students were forced to sing saraswati vandhanam, <br />we <br />      tried to justify that saraswati is common to everyone.</p>
<p>      Then, how can you expect such boneless creatures to react only <br />  for <br />      this? Just because we are programmed to attribute bad things <br />to <br />    DMK <br />      and find faults only in Dravidian parties?</p>

<p>        Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, after <br />      talking with my friend in <br />        Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the <br />new <br />      year. The happenings in <br />        TN disturbed me....</p>
<p>        This mail might bring in a lot criticism and opposition, and <br />    even <br />      the moderators might be <br />        requested to delete this posting..... .</p>
<p>        I am also disturbed that the number of mails wishing for the <br />  new <br />      year is only 2 or 3 <br />        compared to the previous years....Hope people got me where I <br />  am <br />      coming to....</p>
<p>        THough i read sometime back that the Govt. is planning to <br />    celebrate <br />      Thai 1 as Tamil New <br />        yaer and not chittirai 1, i didnt think it will be of such <br />      magnitude. Its ATROCIOUS to <br />        intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote <br />  from <br />    a <br />      few. I was shocked to hear <br />        from my friend that all tv channels say 'chitirai tirunal <br />      vazhthukkal' (as did one of our <br />        member) and not puthandu vazhtukkal..</p>
<p>        I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If <br />  people <br />    say <br />      that this group is not <br />        the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is <br />certainly <br />    in <br />      our groups purview. When we <br />        say we are trying to protect our culture and history, is <br />this <br />    not a <br />      big hit to our culture?</p>
<p>        'Nenju porukudhillaye. .intha nilai ketta manitharai <br />ninaithu <br />      vittaal'..beautiful words of <br />        Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont <br />    have <br />      the back bone to fight <br />        against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I <br />    talked <br />      with my friend around <br />        1.30 in the night (my time) and i could not sleep further. <br />      Wondering where the country is <br />        heading.. </p>
<p>        Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not <br />  even <br />    a <br />      mention of this in our <br />        group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on <br />  the <br />    new <br />      year. If tanjai periya <br />        koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we <br />protest <br />      saying that its a hit for our <br />        culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?</p>
<p>        who gave these people such authority to change religious <br />  things <br />    as <br />      they wish. Will these <br />        people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it <br />cam <br />    eout <br />      of India we should not <br />        follow that calendar? </p>
<p>        Ravi, </p>
<p>        I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu <br />      mythology. I used to think in <br />        those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I <br />  feel <br />      these are also mini <br />        pralaya's where the dharma is being disturbed. </p>
<p>        If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with <br />the <br />      caveat of creamy layer, our <br />        so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will <br />  revisit <br />      the criteria for creamy <br />        layer..</p>
<p>        For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the <br />  state <br />    and <br />      the country, say that <br />        without these people their community could not have <br />improved, <br />  I <br />      like to quote Swami <br />        Chinmayananda,</p>
<p>        'The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they <br />    could <br />      have done better, if the <br />        situations were different'.</p>
<p>        How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people <br />  will <br />    be <br />      bashing the hindu and <br />        their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, <br />but <br />    who <br />      the hell are they to say <br />        that panchangam should not be read in the temples on <br />cithirai <br />  1? </p>
<p>        Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if <br />not <br />    on <br />      the streets. </p>
<p>        Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and <br />what <br />      should be written in this <br />        group. As rightly pointed out by Arun (is that Arun? ) we <br />try <br />  to <br />      brush things under the <br />        carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it <br />  and <br />      gain and spread knowledge <br />        about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan <br />invasion <br />      theory is a myth, we still <br />        stick to it because talking about it going to create <br />  controversy.</p>
<p>        And we say that this group likes to bring out true history <br />and <br />      preserve culture, but dont <br />        spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.</p>
<p>        Moderators, you are free to delete this post, because from <br />    others <br />      perspective, this mail is <br />        surely not related this group.</p>
<p>        God save this country from these butchers of Hinduism....</p>

<p>Again, thinking of the situation, when the whole world has accepted <br />that the aryan invasion theory is a myth and there are not seperate <br />race as Aryans, we dont change ourselves and still stick to it.</p>
<p>But when some one says that Thai 1 is the tamil new year and not <br />chitirai 1, immediately the change is propsed. </p>
<p>If this interest is shown in reveling the true history of India, we <br />would have gone far.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi,</p>
<p>On the East coast (TN), Chidambaram (cosmic dancer), Seerkazhi <br />(birth place of Thirugnana Samandar / Thirumangai Aazhwar) - <br />Thiruvengadu (aadhi chidambaram ) - Thirukkadayur ( Kaalasamharan / <br />Abhirampi battar )- Tarangampadi @ Tranqubar (first European <br />migration - Dutch / Dilapidated Seashore temple Maasilamaneeswarar) -<br />Thirunallaru (Saneeswaran) - Sikkal (Murugan - Singaravelan) - <br />Nagaptnam ( One of Saaptha (7) vidangars - Neelayadakshi) - <br />Vedharanyam @ Thirumaraikkadu ( Eastern Door opened / closed by <br />Sambandar / Appar hymns- recall movie Thiruvartchelvar) are located.</p>
<p>In this stretch, </p>
<p>Tarangampadi @ Tranqubar Church is acknowledeably ancient one..<br />Nagai Darga is ancient one..<br />Velankanni Madha Church is ancient one...</p>
<p>Not only me - many Hindus - while travelling in this stretch, offer <br />prayers (Candles /naatuchakarai etc) in these places of worship too. </p>
<p>Citizens of other Faith living in these areas - cutting across <br />Religeous frontiers - mix freely and truly adopt Secularism !!</p>
<p>Ysterday I was surprised to see a Joseph (my Car driver from <br />Kottayam) lisening and murmoring Carnatic music. when asked he said <br />seveal of his Christian friends are learning and singing Carnatic <br />music (like Dr. Jesudas !!)</p>
<p>That is the brighter side to cherish with.</p>

<p>  I am all for the freedom of opinion as SPS pointed<br />  out. LR Eswari's Karpoora Nayigiye used to be sung<br />  with great gusto by the maids in my family for<br />  Navarathri. My mother was one of those rare people who<br />  invited the servant women for 'thamboolam' in the<br />  conservative Mylapore neighborhood. Her only condition<br />  was that they should sing. Muniamma and her sisters<br />  used to sing 'karpoora nayikiye' with great fervor,<br />  sometimes we would even join in.</p>

<p>      Very good point regarding movie remixes. In telugu<br />    the<br />      movie Ramadasu recently starred Suman as Sri Rama.<br />      Suman was a pornographic movie actor and was<br />    arrested<br />      some time ago for soliciting college girls to make<br />      porn movies. I agree actors cannot live up to<br />    their<br />      images but while portraying godly images some<br />    respect<br />      should be there.</p>
<p>      The late NTR not only was graceful as an actor, he<br />      abstained taking meat and alcohol out of deference<br />    to<br />      the role. His own son Balakrishna said he took<br />    alcohol<br />      and cannot portray Sri Rama therefore. </p>
<p>      Times change, unfortunately mostly for the worse.</p>

        <p>I am sorry, I don't think I worded my post very well.<br />I didn't mean anything religious particularly, I meant<br />more of commitment/respect/dedication the profession<br />which is missing in today's generation (as an actor<br />example - NTR brought a high degree of those values,<br />he lived his roles while he acted them (he was a<br />prolific meat eater otherwise :)) which was one of the<br />reasons for his success.</p>
<p>I am all for the freedom of opinion as SPS pointed<br />out. LR Eswari's Karpoora Nayigiye used to be sung<br />with great gusto by the maids in my family for<br />Navarathri. My mother was one of those rare people who<br />invited the servant women for 'thamboolam' in the<br />conservative Mylapore neighborhood. Her only condition<br />was that they should sing. Muniamma and her sisters<br />used to sing 'karpoora nayikiye' with great fervor,<br />sometimes we would even join in.</p>
<p>God is not limited by our boudaries of religion/caste<br />or even good or bad habits as we see them. </p>

<p>    Very good point regarding movie remixes. In telugu<br />  the<br />    movie Ramadasu recently starred Suman as Sri Rama.<br />    Suman was a pornographic movie actor and was<br />  arrested<br />    some time ago for soliciting college girls to make<br />    porn movies. I agree actors cannot live up to<br />  their<br />    images but while portraying godly images some<br />  respect<br />    should be there.</p>
<p>    The late NTR not only was graceful as an actor, he<br />    abstained taking meat and alcohol out of deference<br />  to<br />    the role. His own son Balakrishna said he took<br />  alcohol<br />    and cannot portray Sri Rama therefore. </p>
<p>    Times change, unfortunately mostly for the worse.</p>

        <p>You are right SPS. Then the govt. should have tried to study the<br />origin of the names rather than changing the new year over night.</p>
<p>now will they have a new set of names for each year starting with Thai<br />1? Yes may be, they will name each year after each caste leader for<br />the vote bank.</p>
<p>Yes. Karunanidhi may be a well versed in tamil, but a scholar should<br />use his brains for the benefit of the masses and not to hurt the<br />masses or take them for a ride. This attitude differentiates Hitler<br />from Gandhi. </p>
<p>I also like to know more on this move, was there any<br />scientific/literary study done to make this change of Thai 1 as the<br />tamil new year? As you say that Karunanidhi is the only living Tamil<br />scholar, did he give any explanation to this move? This is not a<br />sarcastic question, but a genuine one to know on what basis the move<br />was brought forward.</p>

<p>  Dear Members,</p>
<p>  When the TN Government announced that the tamil New Year begins <br />from <br />  Tamil month " Thai first " (which announcement is already 3 month <br />  old) Where is the question of protesting that now?</p>
<p>  When Media - particulary TV Channels with Mass viewership also <br />  used " Chithirai pirappu " and things like that we can also record <br />  our views here and be done with it ...</p>
<p>  Since the topic is discussed my view is :</p>
<p>  SARVAJITH was last Tamil New Year ..</p>
<p>  IN this word SARVA is NOT TAMIL DICTION. JITH too.</p>
<p>  This Year is SARVA DHARI ... Again same thing.</p>
<p>  When did this 60 year NAMING OF TAMIL YEARS occur ?<br />  who did ? when commenced ?<br />  How commended from Chithirai ?</p>
<p>  Why TN Government is telling this to be computed from " Thai" ?</p>
<p>  With these concrete points made available for discussion we can <br />put <br />  forward our views .. instead of mentioning specific names / <br />  parties / races.</p>
<p>  Vaazhthukkal,</p>

<p>    When our temple sculptures were painted with oil paints and made <br />  our <br />    goddess look like a bar girl with mini skirt, we did not protest.</p>
<p>    When pillaiyaar was given AK47 and military dress during <br />vinayakar <br />    chadhurthi, our blood did not boil.</p>
<p>    When temples were destroyed and bathroom tiles were fixed inside <br />  the <br />    sanctum in the name of renovation, our nenju poruththadhu.</p>
<p>    When governments murdered their citizens in the name of <br />religion, <br />  we <br />    didnt have guts to raise the voice.</p>
<p>    When government intervened in the culture of siru dheyva <br />  vazhipaadu, <br />    we least bothered about that.</p>
<p>    When mutts involved in murder cases, we convinced ourselves as <br />    political tit-for-tat.</p>
<p>    When school students were forced to sing saraswati vandhanam, we <br />    tried to justify that saraswati is common to everyone.</p>

<p>      Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, after <br />    talking with my friend in <br />      Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the new <br />    year. The happenings in <br />      TN disturbed me....</p>

<p>      THough i read sometime back that the Govt. is planning to <br />  celebrate <br />    Thai 1 as Tamil New <br />      yaer and not chittirai 1, i didnt think it will be of such <br />    magnitude. Its ATROCIOUS to <br />      intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote <br />from <br />  a <br />    few. I was shocked to hear <br />      from my friend that all tv channels say 'chitirai tirunal <br />    vazhthukkal' (as did one of our <br />      member) and not puthandu vazhtukkal..</p>
<p>      I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If <br />people <br />  say <br />    that this group is not <br />      the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is certainly <br />  in <br />    our groups purview. When we <br />      say we are trying to protect our culture and history, is this <br />  not a <br />    big hit to our culture?</p>
<p>      'Nenju porukudhillaye. .intha nilai ketta manitharai ninaithu <br />    vittaal'..beautiful words of <br />      Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont <br />  have <br />    the back bone to fight <br />      against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I <br />  talked <br />    with my friend around <br />      1.30 in the night (my time) and i could not sleep further. <br />    Wondering where the country is <br />      heading.. </p>
<p>      Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not <br />even <br />  a <br />    mention of this in our <br />      group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on <br />the <br />  new <br />    year. If tanjai periya <br />      koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest <br />    saying that its a hit for our <br />      culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?</p>
<p>      who gave these people such authority to change religious <br />things <br />  as <br />    they wish. Will these <br />      people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it cam <br />  eout <br />    of India we should not <br />      follow that calendar? </p>
<p>      Ravi, </p>
<p>      I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu <br />    mythology. I used to think in <br />      those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I <br />feel <br />    these are also mini <br />      pralaya's where the dharma is being disturbed. </p>
<p>      If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the <br />    caveat of creamy layer, our <br />      so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will <br />revisit <br />    the criteria for creamy <br />      layer..</p>
<p>      For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the <br />state <br />  and <br />    the country, say that <br />      without these people their community could not have improved, <br />I <br />    like to quote Swami <br />      Chinmayananda,</p>
<p>      'The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they <br />  could <br />    have done better, if the <br />      situations were different'.</p>
<p>      How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people <br />will <br />  be <br />    bashing the hindu and <br />      their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but <br />  who <br />    the hell are they to say <br />      that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai <br />1? </p>
<p>      Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not <br />  on <br />    the streets. </p>
<p>      Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what <br />    should be written in this <br />      group. As rightly pointed out by Arun (is that Arun? ) we try <br />to <br />    brush things under the <br />      carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it <br />and <br />    gain and spread knowledge <br />      about it.

        <p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>I was thinking aloud on this subject, since you opened saying " let <br />us not say this is not the forum to discuss ..."</p>
<p>But to discuss, several essential facts needed ..</p>
<p>And primarily religeous and Cultural outfits should have opened <br />their views... surprisingly very less..</p>
<p>Let me put one question straight ::</p>
<p>WHOM DO YOU THINK IS THE ACKNOWLEDGED TAMIL SCHOLAR IN TODAY'S TAMIL <br />WORLD ..OTHER THAN DOCTOR KALAIGNAR ?</p>
<p>Atleast put 5 names for comparison ..</p>
<p>Mu Va<br />Thae Po Mee<br />Bharathi Dasan<br />Parithimal Kalaignar<br />Ma Po Sivagnam  <br />Kripananda Variyar ..... all gone</p>
<p>My Tamil Professor Dr.SATHIYA SEELAN (tamil) is a Living Legend ..</p>
<p>Kavipperasu is my very good friend... </p>
<p>There are Scholarly Professors very good at Tamil language ..</p>
<p>But with due regards to most of them, are they acceptable to the <br />Mass ?</p>
<p>I prefer to keep POLITY out of this .. since no gain Political gain <br />is apparently by this.</p>
<p>I am yet to get convinced What Prabava - Vibhava ---- Sarvajithu - <br />Sarvadhari (tamil years) have to do with Tamil !</p>
<p>regards/ sps</p>

        <p>Dear SPS,<br />There were lot protests on this Government move. There are evidences from sangam litrature for Chiththirai as year beginning. But I could not find a single historical evidence for Thai being the year beginning. </p>
<p>r Paambu panjangam? Or Govt has any other agency to tell us which day the Thai month begins?</p>

<p>Dear Members,</p>
<p>When the TN Government announced that the tamil New Year begins from <br />Tamil month " Thai first " (which announcement is already 3 month <br />old) Where is the question of protesting that now?</p>
<p>When Media - particulary TV Channels with Mass viewership also <br />used " Chithirai pirappu " and things like that we can also record <br />our views here and be done with it ...</p>
<p>Since the topic is discussed my view is :</p>
<p>SARVAJITH was last Tamil New Year ..</p>
<p>IN this word SARVA is NOT TAMIL DICTION. JITH too.</p>
<p>This Year is SARVA DHARI ... Again same thing.</p>
<p>When did this 60 year NAMING OF TAMIL YEARS occur ?<br />who did ? when commenced ?<br />How commended from Chithirai ?</p>
<p>Why TN Government is telling this to be computed from " Thai" ?</p>
<p>With these concrete points made available for discussion we can put <br />forward our views .. instead of mentioning specific names / <br />parties / races.</p>
<p>Vaazhthukkal,</p>

<p>  I agree with you Satish. There should have been some protests. But <br />  nothing. Why? Tamilian's backbone is already broken.</p>
<p>  When our temple sculptures were painted with oil paints and made <br />our <br />  goddess look like a bar girl with mini skirt, we did not protest.</p>
<p>  When pillaiyaar was given AK47 and military dress during vinayakar <br />  chadhurthi, our blood did not boil.</p>
<p>  When temples were destroyed and bathroom tiles were fixed inside <br />the <br />  sanctum in the name of renovation, our nenju poruththadhu.</p>
<p>  When governments murdered their citizens in the name of religion, <br />we <br />  didnt have guts to raise the voice.</p>
<p>  When government intervened in the culture of siru dheyva <br />vazhipaadu, <br />  we least bothered about that.</p>
<p>  When mutts involved in murder cases, we convinced ourselves as <br />  political tit-for-tat.</p>
<p>  When school students were forced to sing saraswati vandhanam, we <br />  tried to justify that saraswati is common to everyone.</p>
<p>  Then, how can you expect such boneless creatures to react only for <br />  this? Just because we are programmed to attribute bad things to <br />DMK <br />  and find faults only in Dravidian parties?</p>

<p>    Hope the new year sees many more great events in PS group... <br />  wishing good luck to all the <br />    new plans that we have ahead....</p>
<p>    Though I wish a happy new year, I am not really happy, after <br />  talking with my friend in <br />    Chennai yesterday night, when I called him to wish for the new <br />  year. The happenings in <br />    TN disturbed me....</p>
<p>    This mail might bring in a lot criticism and opposition, and <br />even <br />  the moderators might be <br />    requested to delete this posting..... .</p>
<p>    I am also disturbed that the number of mails wishing for the new <br />  year is only 2 or 3 <br />    compared to the previous years....Hope people got me where I am <br />  coming to....</p>
<p>    THough i read sometime back that the Govt. is planning to <br />celebrate <br />  Thai 1 as Tamil New <br />    yaer and not chittirai 1, i didnt think it will be of such <br />  magnitude. Its ATROCIOUS to <br />    intervene in religious belief just to satisfy and get vote from <br />a <br />  few. I was shocked to hear <br />    from my friend that all tv channels say 'chitirai tirunal <br />  vazhthukkal' (as did one of our <br />    member) and not puthandu vazhtukkal..</p>
<p>    I am shocked to see there is no protest to this move. If people <br />say <br />  that this group is not <br />    the place to discuss this...I beg to differ. This is certainly <br />in <br />  our groups purview. When we <br />    say we are trying to protect our culture and history, is this <br />not a <br />  big hit to our culture?</p>
<p>    'Nenju porukudhillaye. .intha nilai ketta manitharai ninaithu <br />  vittaal'..beautiful words of <br />    Bharathi... and the nilai ketta manitar includes me who dont <br />have <br />  the back bone to fight <br />    against this so called pseudo secularism in our country. I <br />talked <br />  with my friend around <br />    1.30 in the night (my time) and i could not sleep further. <br />  Wondering where the country is <br />    heading.. </p>
<p>    Forget the external world, i was more surprised to see not even <br />a <br />  mention of this in our <br />    group, and even more surprised not to see anyone wishing on the <br />new <br />  year. If tanjai periya <br />    koil is being destroyed in the name of renovation, we protest <br />  saying that its a hit for our <br />    culture..then is this not a hit for our culture?</p>
<p>    who gave these people such authority to change religious things <br />as <br />  they wish. Will these <br />    people dare to say Jan 1 is western new year and since it cam <br />eout <br />  of India we should not <br />    follow that calendar? </p>
<p>    Ravi, </p>
<p>    I agree with each and every word of your thoughts on Hindu <br />  mythology. I used to think in <br />    those lines, may be not in the depth as you have written. I feel <br />  these are also mini <br />    pralaya's where the dharma is being disturbed. </p>
<p>    If Supreme court gives a ruling passing the OBC quota with the <br />  caveat of creamy layer, our <br />    so called reformists come to the rescue saying they will revisit <br />  the criteria for creamy <br />    layer..</p>
<p>    For those people who support these pseudo seculars in the state <br />and <br />  the country, say that <br />    without these people their community could not have improved, I <br />  like to quote Swami <br />    Chinmayananda,</p>
<p>    'The incapable and the inefficient alone complain that they <br />could <br />  have done better, if the <br />    situations were different'.</p>
<p>    How long these atrocities can go on? How long these people will <br />be <br />  bashing the hindu and <br />    their sentiments? Let the govt observe thai 1 as new year, but <br />who <br />  the hell are they to say <br />    that panchangam should not be read in the temples on cithirai 1? </p>
<p>    Shame on us who cant even protest in this small group, if not <br />on <br />  the streets. </p>
<p>    Recently we were discussing about what is controversy and what <br />  should be written in this <br />    group. As rightly pointed out by Arun (is that Arun? ) we try to <br />  brush things under the <br />    carpet saying that its controversial and never talk about it and <br />  gain and spread knowledge <br />    about it. When the whole world accepts that the aryan invasion <br />  theory is a myth, we still <br />    stick to it because talking about it going to create controversy.</p>
<p>    And we say that this group likes to bring out true history and <br />  preserve culture, but dont <br />    spell a word when the culture is torn to pieces.</p>

<p>Yes, our backbone has been broken long ago and only god can save this<br />country.</p>
<p>Remembering Tirumoolars word - 'iruttai iruttaki azhippan'. He will<br />make darkness more darker before removing it.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Very good point regarding movie remixes. In telugu the<br />  movie Ramadasu recently starred Suman as Sri Rama.<br />  Suman was a pornographic movie actor and was arrested<br />  some time ago for soliciting college girls to make<br />  porn movies. I agree actors cannot live up to their<br />  images but while portraying godly images some respect<br />  should be there.</p>
<p>  The late NTR not only was graceful as an actor, he<br />  abstained taking meat and alcohol out of deference to<br />  the role. His own son Balakrishna said he took alcohol<br />  and cannot portray Sri Rama therefore. </p>
<p>  Times change, unfortunately mostly for the worse.</p>
