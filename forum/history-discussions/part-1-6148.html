</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>When we talk about independence we immediately think about Gandhi and Nehru.<br />But there are somany souls who sacrificed their entire life to the freedom<br />circle from Tamilnadu. Generally these people are not highlighted even<br />within Tamilnadu, atleast we the people of Tamil land try to know about them<br />and remember them.</p>
<p>*Vanchinathan* (1886 - June 17, 1911) , popularly known as Vanchi, was an<br />Indian independence activist. He is best remembered for having shot dead<br />Ashe, the Collector of Thirunelveli and having later committed suicide in<br />order to evade arrest.<br />*Personal Life*</p>
<p>Vanchinathan was born in 1886 in Shenkottai to Raghupathy Iyer and Rukmani<br />Ammal. His actual name was Shankaran. He did his schooling in Shenkottai and<br />graduated in M.A. from Moolam Thirunal Maharaja College in<br />Thiruvananthapuram. Even while in college, he married Ponnammal and got into<br />a lucrative Government job.<br />*Freedom Movement*</p>
<p>On June 17, 1911, Vanchi assassinated Ashe, the district collector of<br />Tirunelveli, who was also known as Collector Dorai. He shot Ashe at<br />point-blank range when Ashe's train had stopped at the Maniyachi station, en<br />route to Madras. He committed suicide thereafter. The railway station has<br />since been renamed Vanchi Maniyachi.</p>
<p>Vanchi was a close collaborator of Varahaneri Venkatesa Subrahmanya Iyer<br />(normally shortened to V.V.S.Aiyar or Va.Ve.Su Iyer), another freedom<br />fighter who sought arms to defeat the British.<br />*Vanchinathan's letter*</p>
<p>I dedicate my life as a small contribution to my motherland. I am alone<br />responsible for this.</p>
<p>3000 youths of this brave country have taken an oath before mother Kali to<br />send King George to hell once he sets his foot on our motherland. I will<br />kill Ashe, whose arrival here is to celebrate the crowning of King George in<br />this glorious land which was once ruled by great samrats. This I do to make<br />them understand the fate of those who cherish the thought of enslaving this<br />sacred land. I, as the youngest of them, wish to warn George by killing Ashe<br />who is his sole representative and has destroyed the Swadeshi shipping<br />company and several other freedom fighters by subjecting them to severe<br />torture.</p>
<p>Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram</p>
<p>*Theeran Chinnamalai**, a lesser-known freedom fighter of Kongu soil<br />*ByKarthik Madhavan</p>
<p>Tamil calendar Aadi 18, which is August 2, 2008, marks the 203rd anniversary<br />of the hanging of a lesser-known freedom fighter Dheeran Chinnamalai.<br />According to historian Pulavar S. Raju, Dheeran Chinnamalai was the first<br />freedom fighter in history to make freedom struggle a people's movement. In<br />the run up to his attack on British East India Company's fort in Coimbatore<br />in 1800, Chinnamalai tried taking the help of Maruthu brothers from<br />Sivaganga and a Maratha chieftain in Mysore. He also forged alliances with<br />Gopal Naicker of Virupatchi; Appachi Gounder of Paramathi,Velur; Joni Jon<br />Khan of Attur, Salem; Kumara Vellai of Perundurai and Varanavasi of Erode in<br />fighting the Company. The plan was to attack the fort on June 3, 1800.<br />Pulavar Raju says Chinnamalai drew the plan to keep up the momentum in the<br />fight against the Company after Kattabomman's and Tippu's death in 1798 and<br />1799 respectively.</p>
<p>Chinnamalai's plans did not succeed as the Company has stopped<br />reinforcements from Maruthu brothers and the Maratha chieftain. Also,<br />Chinnamalai changed his plans and attacked the fort a day earlier. This led<br />to the Company army executing 49 people. Chinnamalai, however escaped.From<br />1800 to until he was hanged on July 31, 1805, Chinnamalai continued to fight<br />against the Company. The historian says he mostly adopted guerrilla warfare<br />against the Company.Three of his fights are important: the 1801 battle on<br />Cauvery banks, the 1802 fight in Odanilai and the 1804 battle in Arachalur.<br />The last and the final one was in 1805. During the fight, Chinnamalai's cook<br />Nallappan betrayed him by disclosing his location to Company sepoys, who<br />hanged him to death in Sivagiri fort. Pulavar Raju says his was the first<br />fight against the British involving people.</p>
<p>*V.O. Chidambaram Pillai*</p>
<p>To V.O. Chidambaram Pillai goes the credit of launching, as the first<br />Indian, a Steam Navigation Company that ran a service between Tuticorin and<br />Colombo. He did it in the interests of the nation's economy, and of course,<br />against the British rule.**</p>
<p>V.O. Chidambaram Pillai came out of the Congress in 1920.</p>
<p>He was born on September 5, 1872 in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. He<br />had his education in Tuticorin and took a Degree in Law form Madras.</p>
<p>He presided over the Salem District Congress session. He entered politics in<br />1905 following the partition of Bengal. He was a great lover of Tamil and<br />encouraged Tamil studies. He wrote a commentary on "Tirukurral" and edited<br />the Tamil work of grammar, Tolkappiam. He passed away on November 18, 1936</p>
<p>*K. Kamaraj*</p>
<p>Kamraj was born on July 15, 1903, in a family of traders at Virudunagar. His<br />real name was Kamakshi Kumaraswamy Nadar but was affectionately shortened to<br />Raja by his mother, Sivakami Ammal. His father, Kumarswamy Nader, was a<br />coconut merchant. Kamaraj was enrolled at the local elementary school, the<br />Nayanar Vidyalaya but was later shifted to the high school Kshatriya<br />Vidyalaya.</p>
<p>Unfortunately his father died within a year of Kamaraj's enrollment in<br />school. Kamaraj's mother sold all jewelry except her earrings and deposited<br />the money with a local merchant and cared for the entire family on the<br />monthly interest that the money earned.</p>
<p>Kamaraj was not a good student in school and dropped out when he was in the<br />sixth grade. When he entered mainstream public life he felt handicapped and<br />realized the importance of a good education. He educated himself during his<br />periods of imprisonment and even learned English from his co-worker.</p>
<p>Kamaraj joined as an apprentice in his maternal uncle Karuppiah's cloth shop<br />after dropping out of school. He would slip out from the shop to join<br />processions and attend public meetings addressed by orators like Dr.<br />Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph. His relatives frowned upon Kamaraj 's<br />budding interest in politics. They sent him to Thiruvananthapuram to work at<br />another uncle's timer shop. Even there Kamaraj participated in the Vaikom<br />Satyagraha led by George Joseph, of the Congress, against the atrocities of<br />the higher caste Hindus on the Harijans. His elders had him called back home<br />and pressured him to marry. Kamaraj resolutely refused to bow to the<br />dictates of his elders.</p>
<p>At the age of 16, Kamaraj enrolled himself as full-time worker of the<br />Congress. He participated in inviting speakers, organizing meetings and<br />collecting funds for the party. He also participated in the march to<br />Vedaranyam led by Rajagopalachari as part of the Salt Satyagraha of March<br />1930.</p>
<p>Kamaraj was arrested and sent to Alipore Jail for two years. He was twenty<br />seven at the time of arrest and was released in 1931 following the<br />Gandhi-Iriwn Pact. Kamaraj was implicated in the Virudhunagar Bomb Case two<br />years later. Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph argued on Kamaraj's<br />behalf and proved the charges to be baseless. Kamaraj was arrested again in<br />1940 and sent to Vellore Jail while he was on his way to Wardha to get<br />Gandhiji's approval for a list of satyagrahis.</p>
<p>While still in jail, Kamaraj was elected Chairman to the Municipal Council.<br />Nine months later upon his release, Kamaraj went straight to the<br />Municipality and tendered his resignation from his post. He felt that "one<br />should not accept any post to which one could not do full justice."</p>
<p>Kamaraj was arrested once more in 1942 and sentenced to three years in the<br />Amaravathi prison for spreading propaganda material for Quit India movement<br />initiated by Gandhiji. While in prison, Kamaraj read books and continued his<br />self-education.</p>
<p>Kamaraj's political guru and inspiration was S. Satyamurti, orator and<br />parliamentarian. Satyamurti found in Kamaraj "an efficient, loyal,<br />indefatigable worker and skillful organizer (p. 147, Pakshirajan)." Both<br />developed a deep friendship and complemented each others' skills. In 1936,<br />Satyamurti was elected President of the Provincial Congress and he appointed<br />Kamaraj the General Secretary. Four years later they swapped positions. The<br />party base was strengthened under their leadership. So deep was Kamaraj's<br />devotion for Satyamurti that when India gained independence, he first went<br />to Satyamurti's house and hoisted the Indian flag there. On his election as<br />Chief Minister, Kamaraj went to Satyamurti's house and garlanded his photo<br />and paid his respects to the leader's widow.</p>
<p>On April 13, 1954, K. Kamaraj reluctantly became the Chief Minister of<br />Madras. To everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated C. Subramaniam and M.<br />Bhakthavatsalam, who had contested his leadership, to the newly formed<br />cabinet. Kamaraj gave simple advice to his ministers, "Face the problem.<br />Don't evade it. Find a solution, however small... . People will be satisfied<br />if you do something." The State made immense strides in education and trade.<br />New schools were opened, better facilities were added to existing ones. No<br />village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high<br />school. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and<br />compulsory education upto eleventh standard. He introduced the Midday Meals<br />Scheme to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor children.<br />He introduced free school uniforms to weed out caste, creed and class<br />distinctions among young minds.</p>
<p>Under Kamaraj's administration, a number of irrigation schemes were<br />completed in record time. The Land Ceiling Act and the Tenancy Protection<br />Act benefited small farmers and saved them from being exploited by<br />landlords. Medium and small scale industries prospered in the midst of large<br />industries making Madras one of the leaders in industrialization. Nehru<br />complimented Kamaraj for making Madras (later renamed State of Tamil Nadu)<br />the best administered State in India."</p>
<p>Kamaraj remained Chief Minister for three consecutive terms. On October 2,<br />1963, he resigned to serve a greater purpose. Kamaraj noticed that the<br />Congress party was slowly losing its vigor . He came up with a plan which<br />was called the "Kamaraj Plan." He proposed that all senior Congress leaders<br />should resign form their posts and devote all their energy to the<br />re-vitalization of the Congress. A number of Central and State ministers<br />like Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jagjivan Ram, Morarji Desai and S.K. Patil<br />followed suite and resigned from their posts. In 1964, Kamaraj was elected<br />the President of the All India Congress and he successfully navigated the<br />nation through the stormy years following Nehru's death.</p>
<p>On October 2, 1975, Gandhi Jayanti, Kamaraj awoke from his afternoon nap<br />feeling uneasy. His housekeeper, Vairavan, rang up his physician. While he<br />was on his way out, Kamaraj said, "Vairavan, put out the lights when you go<br />out." K. Kamaraj died that day. He was honored with the highest civilian<br />honor, the Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1976.</p>
<p>S.Satyamurti</p>
<p>Satyamurti was born on August 19, 1887 in Tirumayyan village, in the<br />principality of Pudukottai, now part of Tamil Nadu. His father, Surendur<br />Sastriar, an orthodox brahmin, scholar, and pleader by profession, died<br />leaving his wife, children and aged parents to fend for themselves.<br />Satyamurti was the eldest of the five sons and one of nine children. It fell<br />to him and his mother to care for the family.</p>
<p>He joined the Christian College, Madras in 1906 for his Bachelors of Arts<br />Course. He was one of the most brilliant students and secured a first class<br />in English and second class in Sanskrit and History. While he diligently<br />pursued his studies, he was greatly influenced by the freedom struggle. He<br />described his college year as "exciting times."</p>
<p>*Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan* was born in Tirutani on September 5, 1888 into a<br />poor brahmin family. His father Sarvepalli Veeraswami was employed on a<br />meagre salary in the zamindari. His mother's name was Sitamma. It was<br />difficult for Radhakrishnan's father to educate him with a meagre income and<br />a large family to take care of.</p>
<p>Radhakrishnan went through most of his education on scholarships. He<br />initially went to school in Tirutani and then to the Lutheran Mission School<br />in Tirupati for his high school. He joined the Voorhee's College in Vellore<br />but switched to the Madras Christian College at the age of 17. He chose<br />philosophy as his major and attained a B.A. and M.A. in the field. He was<br />afraid that his M.A. thesis, "The Ethics of the Vedanta" would offend his<br />philosophy professor, Dr. A.G. Hogg. Instead, Dr. Hogg commended<br />Radhakrishnan on doing an excellent job. Radhakrishnan's M.A. thesis was<br />published when he was only 20</p>
<p>Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamuamma at the age of 16 while still in<br />Vellore. Radhakrishnan accepted an Assistant Lectureship at the Madras<br />Presidency College in 1909. While at the College, he mastered the classics<br />of Hindu philosophy, namely the Upanishads, Bhagvad Gita, Brahmasutra, and<br />commentaries of Sankara, Ramunuja and Madhava. He also acquainted himself<br />with Buddhist and Jain philosophy. At the same time he read philosophical<br />commentaries of Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Bradley, and Bergson. Later on in his<br />life, he studied Marxism and Existentialism.</p>
<p>In 1914, in a strange twist of fate, Radhakrishnan met Srinivasa Ramanujan,<br />the mathematical genius. Srinivasa was leaving for Cambridge for studies and<br />had come to seek Radhakrishnan's blessings because a goddess came in his<br />dream and told him to do so before undertaking the trip. The two never met<br />again.</p>
<p>In 1918, Radhakrishnan was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the<br />University of Mysore. By the time, Radhakrishnan had written many articles<br />for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the<br />International Journal of Ethics. He completed his first book "The Philosophy<br />of Rabindranath Tagore." He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the "genuine<br />manifestation of the Indian spirit." Radhakrishnan's second book, "The Reign<br />of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy" was published in 1920.</p>
<p>Radhakrishnan's books and articles, drew the attention of Ashutosh<br />Mookerjee, Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University. He nominated<br />Radhakrishnan to the prestigious George V Professor of Philosophy at the<br />Calcutta University, 1921. In 1923, Dr. Radhakrishnan's "Indian Philosophy"<br />was published. The book was in response to the request made by Prof. J. H.<br />Muirhead, to write a book on Indian philosophy for the Library of<br />Philosophy. Radhakrishnan accomplished this mammoth task by producing a<br />systematic and readable account of Indian philosophy. The book was hailed as<br />a "philosophical classic and a literary masterpiece."</p>
<p>Radhakrishnan was called to Oxford University, England, to deliver the<br />prestigious "Upton Lectures" on "The Hindu View of Life." The lectures were<br />followed by an invitation to head the Department of Comparative Religion at<br />Oxford. A philanthropist, Spalding, created a professorship for<br />Radhakrishnan to teach Religion and Ethics at Oxford.</p>
<p>Radhakrishnan used his lectures as a platform to further India's cause for<br />freedom. He thundered, "India is not a subject to be administered but a<br />nation seeking its soul." He would graphically describe the "shame of<br />subjection and the lines of sorrow" apparent on every Indian's face.</p>
<p>In 1931, Radhakrishnan was elected Vice Chancellor of the Andhra University.<br />The University was in a state of stagnation. Radhakrishnan restructured the<br />Honors and Post- Graduate teaching in Humanities and Languages, and Science<br />and Technology Departments from scratch. By the time he left in 1936, he had<br />transformed the University into a robust and well-recognized institution.</p>
<p>In 1939, Radhakrishnan became the Vice Chancellor of the Benaras Hindu<br />University, Uttar Pradesh, founded by Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya. The<br />University was under pressure from the Governor, Sir Maurice Hallet, to turn<br />the campus into a war hospital in response to the Quit India Movement<br />launched by Gandhiji and the Congress. Radhakrishnan rushed to Delhi and<br />successfully persuaded the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, to halt the Governor's<br />action. The Governor instead suspended financial support to the University.<br />Radhakrishnan went on "a Begging Pilgrimage," to collect funds from<br />sympathizers and philanthropists. When Malaviyaji retired from University<br />work completely, the Benaras Hindu University requested Radhakrishnan's<br />services for an indefinite period which Radhakrishnan acquiesced to.</p>
<p>After independence on August 15, 1947, Radhakrishnan was requested to Chair<br />the University Education Commission in 1948. The Radhakrishnan Committee's<br />suggestions helped mould the education system for India's needs.</p>
<p>In 1949, Dr. Radhakrishnan was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union. The<br />appointment raised many eyebrows because people wondered what kind of an<br />impression Radhakrishnan, a student of idealist philosophy, would make on<br />Joseph Stalin, an ardent communist. In 1950, Radhakrishnan was called to the<br />Kremlin to meet with the Premier. This was rather irregular. Radhakrishnan<br />was accompanied by Indian Embassy Minister, Rajeshwar Dayal and Soviet<br />Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky and interpreter Pavlov. Radhakrishnan told<br />Stalin, "We had an emperor in India who, after bloody victory, renounced war<br />and became a monk. You have waded your way to power through force. Who knows<br />that might happen to you also." Radhakrishnan was referring to Stalin's<br />infamous "bloody" purges. Stalin smiled and replied, "Yes, miracles do<br />happen sometimes. I was in a theological seminary for five years!"</p>
<p>On April 5, 1952, a few days before Radhakrishnan's departure for India,<br />Stalin called on Radhakrishnan. Radhakrishnan records Stalin's face being<br />bloated. Radhakrishnan patted him on the cheek and on the back. Stalin said,<br />"You are the first person to treat me as a human being and not as a monster.<br />You are leaving us and I am sad. I want you to live long. I have not long to<br />live." Stalin died six months later. Radhakrishnan's legacy in Moscow was a<br />firm and friendly understanding between India and the Soviet Union. A<br />relationship which has flourished over the years and has become even<br />stronger.</p>
<p>Radhakrishnan was elected Vice-President of India in 1952. The<br />Vice-President presides over the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) sessions, much<br />like the Speaker does in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). Often, during a heated<br />debate, Radhakrishnan would intervene with slokas from the sanskrit classics<br />or quotations from the Bible to calm the charged atmosphere. Nehru commented<br />later, "By the way in which Radhakrishnan conducted the proceedings of the<br />Rajya Sabha, he had made the meetings of the House look like family<br />gatherings!"</p>
<p>Dr. Radhakrishnan was honored with the Bharat Ratna in 1954. Around the same<br />time, an 883-page compilation titled "The Philosophy of Dr. Sarvepalli<br />Radhakrishnan" was released in America.</p>
<p>In 1956, Radhakrishnan's devoted wife, Sivakamuamma, passed away after<br />sharing 50 years of married life. The couple had five daughters and a son.</p>
<p>After serving two terms as Vice-President, Radhakrishnan was elected<br />President of India in 1962. Radhakrishnan's tenure as President was marked<br />by the disastrous Indo-China war of 1962, his state visit to the United<br />States in 1963, the end of the Nehru-era with Nehru's death in 1964, and<br />India's victorious performance against Pakistan in 1965 under Lal Bahadur<br />Shastri. Radhakrishnan guided each of the Prime Ministers wisely and helped<br />see India through those trying years safely. Radhakrishnan refused to<br />continue for another term as President after his term ended in 1967.</p>
<p>At the age of 79, Dr. Radhakrishnan returned to Madras in May 1967 to a warm<br />homecoming. He spent his last years happily at his house "Girija" in<br />Mylapore, Madras.</p>
<p>Dr. Radhakrishnan died on April 17, 1975.</p>

<p> <br />Dear Friends,<br />When we talk about independence we immediately think about Gandhi and Nehru.. But there are somany souls who sacrificed their entire life to the freedom circle from Tamilnadu. Generally these people are not highlighted even within Tamilnadu, atleast we the people of Tamil land try to know about themand remember them. <br />Vanchinathan (1886 - June 17, 1911) , popularly known as Vanchi, was an Indian independence activist. He is best remembered for having shot dead Ashe,the Collector of Thirunelveli and having later committed suicide in order to evade arrest.<br />Personal Life<br />Vanchinathan was born in 1886 in Shenkottai to Raghupathy Iyer and Rukmani Ammal. His actual name was Shankaran. He did his schooling in Shenkottai and graduated in M.A. from Moolam Thirunal Maharaja College in Thiruvananthapuram. Even while in college, he married Ponnammal and got into a lucrative Government job.<br />Freedom Movement<br />On June 17, 1911, Vanchi assassinated Ashe, the district collector of Tirunelveli, who was also known as Collector Dorai. He shot Ashe at point-blank range when Ashe's train had stopped at the Maniyachi station, en route to Madras. He committed suicide thereafter. The railway station has since been renamed Vanchi Maniyachi.<br />Vanchi was a close collaborator of Varahaneri Venkatesa Subrahmanya Iyer (normally shortened to V.V.S.Aiyar or Va.Ve.Su Iyer), another freedom fighterwho sought arms to defeat the British.<br />Vanchinathan's letter<br />I dedicate my life as a small contribution to my motherland. I am alone responsible for this. <br />3000 youths of this brave country have taken an oath before mother Kali to send King George to hell once he sets his foot on our motherland. I will kill Ashe, whose arrival here is to celebrate the crowning of King George in this glorious land which was once ruled by great samrats. This I do to makethem understand the fate of those who cherish the thought of enslaving this sacred land. I, as the youngest of them, wish to warn George by killing Ashe who is his sole representative and has destroyed the Swadeshi shipping company and several other freedom fighters by subjecting them to severe torture.<br />Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram<br />Theeran Chinnamalai, a lesser-known freedom fighter of Kongu soil By Karthik Madhavan<br />Tamil calendar Aadi 18, which is August 2, 2008, marks the 203rd anniversary of the hanging of a lesser-known freedom fighter Dheeran Chinnamalai. According to historian Pulavar S. Raju, Dheeran Chinnamalai was the first freedom fighter in history to make freedom struggle a people's movement. In therun up to his attack on British East India Company's fort in Coimbatore in1800, Chinnamalai tried taking the help of Maruthu brothers from Sivagangaand a Maratha chieftain in Mysore. He also forged alliances with Gopal Naicker of Virupatchi; Appachi Gounder of Paramathi,Velur; Joni Jon Khan of Attur, Salem; Kumara Vellai of Perundurai and Varanavasi of Erode in fightingthe Company. The plan was to attack the fort on June 3, 1800. Pulavar Rajusays Chinnamalai drew the plan to keep up the momentum in the fight against the Company after Kattabomman's and Tippu's death in 1798 and 1799 respectively. <br />Chinnamalai's plans did not succeed as the Company has stopped reinforcements from Maruthu brothers and the Maratha chieftain. Also, Chinnamalai changed his plans and attacked the fort a day earlier. This led to the Company awas hanged on July 31, 1805, Chinnamalai continued to fight against the Company. The historian says he mostly adopted guerrilla warfare against the Company.Three of his fights are important: the 1801 battle on Cauvery banks,the 1802 fight in Odanilai and the 1804 battle in Arachalur. The last and the final one was in 1805. During the fight, Chinnamalai's cook Nallappan betrayed him by disclosing his location to Company sepoys, who hanged him todeath in Sivagiri fort. Pulavar Raju says his was the first fight against the British involving people. <br />V.O. Chidambaram Pillai<br />To V.O. Chidambaram Pillai goes the credit of launching, as the first Indian, a Steam Navigation Company that ran a service between Tuticorin and Colombo. He did it in the interests of the nation's economy, and of course, against the British rule.<br />V.O. Chidambaram Pillai came out of the Congress in 1920. <br />He was born on September 5, 1872 in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. He had his education in Tuticorin and took a Degree in Law form Madras. <br />He presided over the Salem District Congress session. He entered politics in 1905 following the partition of Bengal. He was a great lover of Tamil andencouraged Tamil studies. He wrote a commentary on "Tirukurral" and editedthe Tamil work of grammar, Tolkappiam. He passed away on November 18, 1936<br />K. Kamaraj<br />Kamraj was born on July 15, 1903, in a family of traders at Virudunagar. His real name was Kamakshi Kumaraswamy Nadar but was affectionately shortenedto Raja by his mother, Sivakami Ammal. His father, Kumarswamy Nader, was acoconut merchant. Kamaraj was enrolled at the local elementary school, theNayanar Vidyalaya but was later shifted to the high school Kshatriya Vidyalaya. </p>
<p>Unfortunately his father died within a year of Kamaraj's enrollment in school. Kamaraj's mother sold all jewelry except her earrings and deposited themoney with a local merchant and cared for the entire family on the monthlyinterest that the money earned.<br />Kamaraj was not a good student in school and dropped out when he was in thesixth grade. When he entered mainstream public life he felt handicapped and realized the importance of a good education. He educated himself during his periods of imprisonment and even learned English from his co-worker. <br />Kamaraj joined as an apprentice in his maternal uncle Karuppiah's cloth shop after dropping out of school. He would slip out from the shop to join processions and attend public meetings addressed by orators like Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph. His relatives frowned upon Kamaraj 's budding interest in politics. They sent him to Thiruvananthapuram to work at another uncle's timer shop. Even there Kamaraj participated in the Vaikom Satyagraha led by George Joseph, of the Congress, against the atrocities of the higher caste Hindus on the Harijans. His elders had him called back home and pressured him to marry. Kamaraj resolutely refused to bow to the dictates of his elders. <br />At the age of 16, Kamaraj enrolled himself as full-time worker of the Congress. He participated in inviting speakers, organizing meetings and collecting funds for the party. He also participated in the march to Vedaranyam ledby Rajagopalachari as part of the Salt Satyagraha of March 1930. <br />Kamaraj was arrested and sent to Alipore Jail for two years. He was twenty seven at the time of arrest and was released in 1931 following the Gandhi-Iriwn Pact. Kamaraj was implicated in the Virudhunagar Bomb Case two years later. Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph argued on Kamaraj's behalf and proved the charges to be baseless. Kamaraj was arrested again in 1940 and sent to Vellore Jail while he was on his way to Wardha to get Gandhiji's approval for a list of satyagrahis.  <br />While still in jail, Kamaraj was elected Chairman to the Municipal Council.Nine months later upon his release, Kamaraj went straight to the Municipality and tendered his resignation from his post. He felt that "one should not accept any post to which one could not do full justice." <br />Kamaraj was arrested once more in 1942 and sentenced to three years in the Amaravathi prison for spreading propaganda material for Quit India movementinitiated by Gandhiji. While in prison, Kamaraj read books and continued his self-education. </p>
<p>Kamaraj's political guru and inspiration was S. Satyamurti, orator and parliamentarian. Satyamurti found in Kamaraj "an efficient, loyal, indefatigable worker and skillful organizer (p. 147, Pakshirajan) ." Both developed a deep friendship and complemented each others' skills. In 1936, Satyamurti was elected President of the Provincial Congress and he appointed Kamaraj theGeneral Secretary. Four years later they swapped positions. The party basewas strengthened under their leadership. So deep was Kamaraj's devotion for Satyamurti that when India gained independence, he first went to Satyamurti's house and hoisted the Indian flag there. On his election as Chief Minister, Kamaraj went to Satyamurti's house and garlanded his photo and paid his respects to the leader's widow.<br />On April 13, 1954, K. Kamaraj reluctantly became the Chief Minister of Madras. To everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated C. Subramaniam and M. Bhakthavatsalam, who had contested his leadership, to the newly formed cabinet. Kamaraj gave simple advice to his ministers, "Face the problem. Don't evade it. Find a solution, however small... . People will be satisfied if you do something." The State made immense strides in education and trade. New schools were opened, better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education upto eleventh standard. He introduced the Midday Meals Scheme to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor children. He introducedfree school uniforms to weed out caste, creed and class distinctions amongyoung minds. <br />Under Kamaraj's administration, a number of irrigation schemes were completed in record time. The Land Ceiling Act and the Tenancy Protection Act benefited small farmers and saved them from being exploited by landlords. Medium and small scale industries prospered in the midst of large industries making Madras one of the leaders in industrialization. Nehru complimented Kamaraj for making Madras (later renamed State of Tamil Nadu) the best administered State in India." <br />Kamaraj remained Chief Minister for three consecutive terms. On October 2, 1963, he resigned to serve a greater purpose. Kamaraj noticed that the Congress party was slowly losing its vigor . He came up with a plan which was called the "Kamaraj Plan." He proposed that all senior Congress leaders should resign form their posts and devote all their energy to the re-vitalization of the Congress. A number of Central and State ministers like Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jagjivan Ram, Morarji Desai and S.K. Patil followed suite and resigned from their posts. In 1964, Kamaraj was elected the President of the All India Congress and he successfully navigated the nation through the stormy years following Nehru's death. <br />On October 2, 1975, Gandhi Jayanti, Kamaraj awoke from his afternoon nap feeling uneasy. His housekeeper, Vairavan, rang up his physician. While he was on his way out, Kamaraj said, "Vairavan, put out the lights when you go out." K. Kamaraj died that day. He was honored with the highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1976.<br />S.Satyamurti<br />Satyamurti was born on August 19, 1887 in Tirumayyan village, in the principality of Pudukottai, now part of Tamil Nadu. His father, Surendur Sastriar, an orthodox brahmin, scholar, and pleader by profession, died leaving hiswife, children and aged parents to fend for themselves. Satyamurti was theeldest of the five sons and one of nine children. It fell to him and his mother to care for the family. <br />He joined the Christian College, Madras in 1906 for his Bachelors of Arts Course. He was one of the most brilliant students and secured a first class in English and second class in Sanskrit and History. While he diligently pursued his studies, he was greatly influenced by the freedom struggle. He described his college year as "exciting times."<br />Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was born in Tirutani on September 5, 1888 into a poor brahmin family. His father Sarvepalli Veeraswami was employed on a meagre salary in the zamindari. His mother's name was Sitamma. It was difficultfor Radhakrishnan's father to educate him with a meagre income and a largefamily to take care of.  <br />Radhakrishnan went through most of his education on scholarships. He initially went to school in Tirutani and then to the Lutheran Mission School in Tirupati for his high school. He joined the Voorhee's College in Vellore butswitched to the Madras Christian College at the age of 17. He chose philosophy as his major and attained a B.A. and M.A. in the field. He was afraid that his M.A. thesis, "The Ethics of the Vedanta" would offend his philosophy professor, Dr. A.G. Hogg. Instead, Dr. Hogg commended Radhakrishnan on doing an excellent job. Radhakrishnan's M.A. thesis was published when he was only 20<br />Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamuamma at the age of 16 while still in Vellore. Radhakrishnan accepted an Assistant Lectureship at the Madras Presidency College in 1909. While at the College, he mastered the classics of Hindu philosophy, namely the Upanishads, Bhagvad Gita, Brahmasutra, and commentaries of Sankara, Ramunuja and Madhava. He also acquainted himself with Buddhist and Jain philosophy. At the same time he read philosophical commentaries of Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Bradley, and Bergson. Later on in his life,he studied Marxism and Existentialism.  <br />In 1914, in a strange twist of fate, Radhakrishnan met Srinivasa Ramanujan,the mathematical genius. Srinivasa was leaving for Cambridge for studies and had come to seek Radhakrishnan's blessings because a goddess came in hisdream and told him to do so before undertaking the trip. The two never metagain.  <br />In 1918, Radhakrishnan was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore. By the time, Radhakrishnan had written many articles for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the International Journal of Ethics. He completed his first book "The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore." He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the "genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit." Radhakrishnan's second book, "The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy" was published in 1920.  <br />Radhakrishnan's books and articles, drew the attention of Ashutosh Mookerjee, Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University. He nominated Radhakrishnan to the prestigious George V Professor of Philosophy at the Calcutta University, 1921. In 1923, Dr. Radhakrishnan's "Indian Philosophy" was published. The book was in response to the request made by Prof. J. H. Muirhead, to write abook on Indian philosophy for the Library of Philosophy. Radhakrishnan accomplished this mammoth task by producing a systematic and readable account of Indian philosophy. The book was hailed as a "philosophical classic and aliterary masterpiece."  <br />Radhakrishnan was called to Oxford University, England, to deliver the prestigious "Upton Lectures" on "The Hindu View of Life." The lectures were followed by an invitation to head the Department of Comparative Religion at Oxford. A philanthropist, Spalding, created a professorship for Radhakrishnanto teach Religion and Ethics at Oxford.  <br />Radhakrishnan used his lectures as a platform to further India's cause for freedom. He thundered, "India is not a subject to be administered but a nation seeking its soul." He would graphically describe the "shame of subjection and the lines of sorrow" apparent on every Indian's face.  <br />In 1931, Radhakrishnan was elected Vice Chancellor of the Andhra University.. The University was in a state of stagnation. Radhakrishnan restructured the Honors and Post- Graduate teaching in Humanities and Languages, and Science and Technology Departments from scratch. By the time he left in 1936, he had transformed the University into a robust and well-recognized institution.  <br />In 1939, Radhakrishnan became the Vice Chancellor of the Benaras Hindu University, Uttar Pradesh, founded by Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya. The University was under pressure from the Governor, Sir Maurice Hallet, to turn the campus into a war hospital in response to the Quit India Movement launched by Gandhiji and the Congress. Radhakrishnan rushed to Delhi and successfully persuaded the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, to halt the Governor's action. The Governor instead suspended financial support to the University. Radhakrishnan went on "a Begging Pilgrimage," to collect funds from sympathizers and philanthropists. When Malaviyaji retired from University work completely, the Benaras Hindu University requested Radhakrishnan's services for an indefinite period which Radhakrishnan acquiesced to. </p>
<p> <br />After independence on August 15, 1947, Radhakrishnan was requested to Chairthe University Education Commission in 1948. The Radhakrishnan Committee'ssuggestions helped mould the education system for India's needs.  <br />In 1949, Dr. Radhakrishnan was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union. The appointment raised many eyebrows because people wondered what kind of an impression Radhakrishnan, a student of idealist philosophy, would make on Joseph Stalin, an ardent communist. In 1950, Radhakrishnan was called to theKremlin to meet with the Premier. This was rather irregular. Radhakrishnanwas accompanied by Indian Embassy Minister, Rajeshwar Dayal and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky and interpreter Pavlov. Radhakrishnan told Stalin, "We had an emperor in India who, after bloody victory, renounced warand became a monk. You have waded your way to power through force. Who knows that might happen to you also." Radhakrishnan was referring to Stalin's infamous "bloody" purges. Stalin smiled and replied, "Yes, miracles do happen sometimes. I was in a theological seminary for five years!"  <br />On April 5, 1952, a few days before Radhakrishnan's departure for India, Stalin called on Radhakrishnan. Radhakrishnan records Stalin's face being bloated. Radhakrishnan patted him on the cheek and on the back. Stalin said, "You are the first person to treat me as a human being and not as a monster.You are leaving us and I am sad. I want you to live long. I have not long to live." Stalin died six months later. Radhakrishnan's legacy in Moscow was a firm and friendly understanding between India and the Soviet Union. A relationship which has flourished over the years and has become even stronger.  <br />Radhakrishnan was elected Vice-President of India in 1952. The Vice-President presides over the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) sessions, much like the Speaker does in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). Often, during a heated debate, Radhakrishnan would intervene with slokas from the sanskrit classics or quotations from the Bible to calm the charged atmosphere. Nehru commented later, "By the way in which Radhakrishnan conducted the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha, he had made the meetings of the House look like family gatherings!"  <br />Dr. Radhakrishnan was honored with the Bharat Ratna in 1954. Around the same time, an 883-page compilation titled "The Philosophy of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan" was released in America.  <br />In 1956, Radhakrishnan's devoted wife, Sivakamuamma, passed away after sharing 50 years of married life. The couple had five daughters and a son.  <br />After serving two terms as Vice-President, Radhakrishnan was elected President of India in 1962. Radhakrishnan's tenure as President was marked by thedisastrous Indo-China war of 1962, his state visit to the United States in1963, the end of the Nehru-era with Nehru's death in 1964, and India's victorious performance against Pakistan in 1965 under Lal Bahadur Shastri. Radhakrishnan guided each of the Prime Ministers wisely and helped see India through those trying years safely. Radhakrishnan refused to continue for another term as President after his term ended in 1967.  <br />At the age of 79, Dr. Radhakrishnan returned to Madras in May 1967 to a warm homecoming. He spent his last years happily at his house "Girija" in Mylapore, Madras.  <br />Dr. Radhakrishnan died on April 17, 1975.<br /> Courtesy: Wiki &amp; some websites</p>

<p> <br />Dear Friends,<br />When we talk about independence we immediately think about Gandhi and Nehru.. But there are somany souls who sacrificed their entire life to the freedom circle from Tamilnadu. Generally these people are not highlighted even within Tamilnadu, atleast we the people of Tamil land try to know about themand remember them. <br />Vanchinathan (1886 - June 17, 1911) , popularly known as Vanchi, was an Indian independence activist. He is best remembered for having shot dead Ashe,the Collector of Thirunelveli and having later committed suicide in order to evade arrest.<br />Personal Life<br />Vanchinathan was born in 1886 in Shenkottai to Raghupathy Iyer and Rukmani Ammal. His actual name was Shankaran. He did his schooling in Shenkottai and graduated in M.A. from Moolam Thirunal Maharaja College in Thiruvananthapuram. Even while in college, he married Ponnammal and got into a lucrative Government job.<br />Freedom Movement<br />On June 17, 1911, Vanchi assassinated Ashe, the district collector of Tirunelveli, who was also known as Collector Dorai. He shot Ashe at point-blank range when Ashe's train had stopped at the Maniyachi station, en route to Madras. He committed suicide thereafter. The railway station has since been renamed Vanchi Maniyachi.<br />Vanchi was a close collaborator of Varahaneri Venkatesa Subrahmanya Iyer (normally shortened to V.V.S.Aiyar or Va.Ve.Su Iyer), another freedom fighterwho sought arms to defeat the British.<br />Vanchinathan's letter<br />I dedicate my life as a small contribution to my motherland. I am alone responsible for this. <br />3000 youths of this brave country have taken an oath before mother Kali to send King George to hell once he sets his foot on our motherland. I will kill Ashe, whose arrival here is to celebrate the crowning of King George in this glorious land which was once ruled by great samrats. This I do to makethem understand the fate of those who cherish the thought of enslaving this sacred land. I, as the youngest of them, wish to warn George by killing Ashe who is his sole representative and has destroyed the Swadeshi shipping company and several other freedom fighters by subjecting them to severe torture.<br />Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram<br />Theeran Chinnamalai, a lesser-known freedom fighter of Kongu soil By Karthik Madhavan<br />Tamil calendar Aadi 18, which is August 2, 2008, marks the 203rd anniversary of the hanging of a lesser-known freedom fighter Dheeran Chinnamalai. According to historian Pulavar S. Raju, Dheeran Chinnamalai was the first freedom fighter in history to make freedom struggle a people's movement. In therun up to his attack on British East India Company's fort in Coimbatore in1800, Chinnamalai tried taking the help of Maruthu brothers from Sivagangaand a Maratha chieftain in Mysore. He also forged alliances with Gopal Naicker of Virupatchi; Appachi Gounder of Paramathi,Velur; Joni Jon Khan of Attur, Salem; Kumara Vellai of Perundurai and Varanavasi of Erode in fightingthe Company. The plan was to attack the fort on June 3, 1800. Pulavar Rajusays Chinnamalai drew the plan to keep up the momentum in the fight against the Company after Kattabomman's and Tippu's death in 1798 and 1799 respectively. <br />Chinnamalai's plans did not succeed as the Company has stopped reinforcements from Maruthu brothers and the Maratha chieftain. Also, Chinnamalai changed his plans and attacked the fort a day earlier. This led to the Company awas hanged on July 31, 1805, Chinnamalai continued to fight against the Company. The historian says he mostly adopted guerrilla warfare against the Company.Three of his fights are important: the 1801 battle on Cauvery banks,the 1802 fight in Odanilai and the 1804 battle in Arachalur. The last and the final one was in 1805. During the fight, Chinnamalai's cook Nallappan betrayed him by disclosing his location to Company sepoys, who hanged him todeath in Sivagiri fort. Pulavar Raju says his was the first fight against the British involving people. <br />V.O. Chidambaram Pillai<br />To V.O. Chidambaram Pillai goes the credit of launching, as the first Indian, a Steam Navigation Company that ran a service between Tuticorin and Colombo. He did it in the interests of the nation's economy, and of course, against the British rule.<br />V.O. Chidambaram Pillai came out of the Congress in 1920. <br />He was born on September 5, 1872 in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. He had his education in Tuticorin and took a Degree in Law form Madras. <br />He presided over the Salem District Congress session. He entered politics in 1905 following the partition of Bengal. He was a great lover of Tamil andencouraged Tamil studies. He wrote a commentary on "Tirukurral" and editedthe Tamil work of grammar, Tolkappiam. He passed away on November 18, 1936<br />K. Kamaraj<br />Kamraj was born on July 15, 1903, in a family of traders at Virudunagar. His real name was Kamakshi Kumaraswamy Nadar but was affectionately shortenedto Raja by his mother, Sivakami Ammal. His father, Kumarswamy Nader, was acoconut merchant. Kamaraj was enrolled at the local elementary school, theNayanar Vidyalaya but was later shifted to the high school Kshatriya Vidyalaya. </p>
<p>Unfortunately his father died within a year of Kamaraj's enrollment in school. Kamaraj's mother sold all jewelry except her earrings and deposited themoney with a local merchant and cared for the entire family on the monthlyinterest that the money earned.<br />Kamaraj was not a good student in school and dropped out when he was in thesixth grade. When he entered mainstream public life he felt handicapped and realized the importance of a good education. He educated himself during his periods of imprisonment and even learned English from his co-worker. <br />Kamaraj joined as an apprentice in his maternal uncle Karuppiah's cloth shop after dropping out of school. He would slip out from the shop to join processions and attend public meetings addressed by orators like Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph. His relatives frowned upon Kamaraj 's budding interest in politics. They sent him to Thiruvananthapuram to work at another uncle's timer shop. Even there Kamaraj participated in the Vaikom Satyagraha led by George Joseph, of the Congress, against the atrocities of the higher caste Hindus on the Harijans. His elders had him called back home and pressured him to marry. Kamaraj resolutely refused to bow to the dictates of his elders. <br />At the age of 16, Kamaraj enrolled himself as full-time worker of the Congress. He participated in inviting speakers, organizing meetings and collecting funds for the party. He also participated in the march to Vedaranyam ledby Rajagopalachari as part of the Salt Satyagraha of March 1930. <br />Kamaraj was arrested and sent to Alipore Jail for two years. He was twenty seven at the time of arrest and was released in 1931 following the Gandhi-Iriwn Pact. Kamaraj was implicated in the Virudhunagar Bomb Case two years later. Dr. Varadarajulu Naidu and George Joseph argued on Kamaraj's behalf and proved the charges to be baseless. Kamaraj was arrested again in 1940 and sent to Vellore Jail while he was on his way to Wardha to get Gandhiji's approval for a list of satyagrahis.  <br />While still in jail, Kamaraj was elected Chairman to the Municipal Council.Nine months later upon his release, Kamaraj went straight to the Municipality and tendered his resignation from his post. He felt that "one should not accept any post to which one could not do full justice." <br />Kamaraj was arrested once more in 1942 and sentenced to three years in the Amaravathi prison for spreading propaganda material for Quit India movementinitiated by Gandhiji. While in prison, Kamaraj read books and continued his self-education. </p>
<p>Kamaraj's political guru and inspiration was S. Satyamurti, orator and parliamentarian. Satyamurti found in Kamaraj "an efficient, loyal, indefatigable worker and skillful organizer (p. 147, Pakshirajan) ." Both developed a deep friendship and complemented each others' skills. In 1936, Satyamurti was elected President of the Provincial Congress and he appointed Kamaraj theGeneral Secretary. Four years later they swapped positions. The party basewas strengthened under their leadership. So deep was Kamaraj's devotion for Satyamurti that when India gained independence, he first went to Satyamurti's house and hoisted the Indian flag there. On his election as Chief Minister, Kamaraj went to Satyamurti's house and garlanded his photo and paid his respects to the leader's widow.<br />On April 13, 1954, K. Kamaraj reluctantly became the Chief Minister of Madras. To everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated C. Subramaniam and M. Bhakthavatsalam, who had contested his leadership, to the newly formed cabinet. Kamaraj gave simple advice to his ministers, "Face the problem. Don't evade it. Find a solution, however small... . People will be satisfied if you do something." The State made immense strides in education and trade. New schools were opened, better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education upto eleventh standard. He introduced the Midday Meals Scheme to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor children. He introducedfree school uniforms to weed out caste, creed and class distinctions amongyoung minds. <br />Under Kamaraj's administration, a number of irrigation schemes were completed in record time. The Land Ceiling Act and the Tenancy Protection Act benefited small farmers and saved them from being exploited by landlords. Medium and small scale industries prospered in the midst of large industries making Madras one of the leaders in industrialization. Nehru complimented Kamaraj for making Madras (later renamed State of Tamil Nadu) the best administered State in India." <br />Kamaraj remained Chief Minister for three consecutive terms. On October 2, 1963, he resigned to serve a greater purpose. Kamaraj noticed that the Congress party was slowly losing its vigor . He came up with a plan which was called the "Kamaraj Plan." He proposed that all senior Congress leaders should resign form their posts and devote all their energy to the re-vitalization of the Congress. A number of Central and State ministers like Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jagjivan Ram, Morarji Desai and S.K. Patil followed suite and resigned from their posts. In 1964, Kamaraj was elected the President of the All India Congress and he successfully navigated the nation through the stormy years following Nehru's death. <br />On October 2, 1975, Gandhi Jayanti, Kamaraj awoke from his afternoon nap feeling uneasy. His housekeeper, Vairavan, rang up his physician. While he was on his way out, Kamaraj said, "Vairavan, put out the lights when you go out." K. Kamaraj died that day. He was honored with the highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1976.<br />S.Satyamurti<br />Satyamurti was born on August 19, 1887 in Tirumayyan village, in the principality of Pudukottai, now part of Tamil Nadu. His father, Surendur Sastriar, an orthodox brahmin, scholar, and pleader by profession, died leaving hiswife, children and aged parents to fend for themselves. Satyamurti was theeldest of the five sons and one of nine children. It fell to him and his mother to care for the family. <br />He joined the Christian College, Madras in 1906 for his Bachelors of Arts Course. He was one of the most brilliant students and secured a first class in English and second class in Sanskrit and History. While he diligently pursued his studies, he was greatly influenced by the freedom struggle. He described his college year as "exciting times."<br />Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was born in Tirutani on September 5, 1888 into a poor brahmin family. His father Sarvepalli Veeraswami was employed on a meagre salary in the zamindari. His mother's name was Sitamma. It was difficultfor Radhakrishnan's father to educate him with a meagre income and a largefamily to take care of.  <br />Radhakrishnan went through most of his education on scholarships. He initially went to school in Tirutani and then to the Lutheran Mission School in Tirupati for his high school. He joined the Voorhee's College in Vellore butswitched to the Madras Christian College at the age of 17. He chose philosophy as his major and attained a B.A. and M.A. in the field. He was afraid that his M.A. thesis, "The Ethics of the Vedanta" would offend his philosophy professor, Dr. A.G. Hogg. Instead, Dr. Hogg commended Radhakrishnan on doing an excellent job. Radhakrishnan's M.A. thesis was published when he was only 20<br />Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamuamma at the age of 16 while still in Vellore. Radhakrishnan accepted an Assistant Lectureship at the Madras Presidency College in 1909. While at the College, he mastered the classics of Hindu philosophy, namely the Upanishads, Bhagvad Gita, Brahmasutra, and commentaries of Sankara, Ramunuja and Madhava. He also acquainted himself with Buddhist and Jain philosophy. At the same time he read philosophical commentaries of Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Bradley, and Bergson. Later on in his life,he studied Marxism and Existentialism.  <br />In 1914, in a strange twist of fate, Radhakrishnan met Srinivasa Ramanujan,the mathematical genius. Srinivasa was leaving for Cambridge for studies and had come to seek Radhakrishnan's blessings because a goddess came in hisdream and told him to do so before undertaking the trip. The two never metagain.  <br />In 1918, Radhakrishnan was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore. By the time, Radhakrishnan had written many articles for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the International Journal of Ethics. He completed his first book "The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore." He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the "genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit." Radhakrishnan's second book, "The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy" was published in 1920.  <br />Radhakrishnan's books and articles, drew the attention of Ashutosh Mookerjee, Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University. He nominated Radhakrishnan to the prestigious George V Professor of Philosophy at the Calcutta University, 1921. In 1923, Dr. Radhakrishnan's "Indian Philosophy" was published. The book was in response to the request made by Prof. J. H. Muirhead, to write abook on Indian philosophy for the Library of Philosophy. Radhakrishnan accomplished this mammoth task by producing a systematic and readable account of Indian philosophy. The book was hailed as a "philosophical classic and aliterary masterpiece."  <br />Radhakrishnan was called to Oxford University, England, to deliver the prestigious "Upton Lectures" on "The Hindu View of Life." The lectures were followed by an invitation to head the Department of Comparative Religion at Oxford. A philanthropist, Spalding, created a professorship for Radhakrishnanto teach Religion and Ethics at Oxford.  <br />Radhakrishnan used his lectures as a platform to further India's cause for freedom. He thundered, "India is not a subject to be administered but a nation seeking its soul." He would graphically describe the "shame of subjection and the lines of sorrow" apparent on every Indian's face.  <br />In 1931, Radhakrishnan was elected Vice Chancellor of the Andhra University.. The University was in a state of stagnation. Radhakrishnan restructured the Honors and Post- Graduate teaching in Humanities and Languages, and Science and Technology Departments from scratch. By the time he left in 1936, he had transformed the University into a robust and well-recognized institution.  <br />In 1939, Radhakrishnan became the Vice Chancellor of the Benaras Hindu University, Uttar Pradesh, founded by Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya. The University was under pressure from the Governor, Sir Maurice Hallet, to turn the campus into a war hospital in response to the Quit India Movement launched by Gandhiji and the Congress. Radhakrishnan rushed to Delhi and successfully persuaded the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, to halt the Governor's action. The Governor instead suspended financial support to the University. Radhakrishnan went on "a Begging Pilgrimage," to collect funds from sympathizers and philanthropists. When Malaviyaji retired from University work completely, the Benaras Hindu University requested Radhakrishnan's services for an indefinite period which Radhakrishnan acquiesced to. </p>
<p> <br />After independence on August 15, 1947, Radhakrishnan was requested to Chairthe University Education Commission in 1948. The Radhakrishnan Committee'ssuggestions helped mould the education system for India's needs.  <br />In 1949, Dr. Radhakrishnan was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union. The appointment raised many eyebrows because people wondered what kind of an impression Radhakrishnan, a student of idealist philosophy, would make on Joseph Stalin, an ardent communist. In 1950, Radhakrishnan was called to theKremlin to meet with the Premier. This was rather irregular. Radhakrishnanwas accompanied by Indian Embassy Minister, Rajeshwar Dayal and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky and interpreter Pavlov. Radhakrishnan told Stalin, "We had an emperor in India who, after bloody victory, renounced warand became a monk. You have waded your way to power through force. Who knows that might happen to you also." Radhakrishnan was referring to Stalin's infamous "bloody" purges. Stalin smiled and replied, "Yes, miracles do happen sometimes. I was in a theological seminary for five years!"  <br />On April 5, 1952, a few days before Radhakrishnan's departure for India, Stalin called on Radhakrishnan. Radhakrishnan records Stalin's face being bloated. Radhakrishnan patted him on the cheek and on the back. Stalin said, "You are the first person to treat me as a human being and not as a monster.You are leaving us and I am sad. I want you to live long. I have not long to live." Stalin died six months later. Radhakrishnan's legacy in Moscow was a firm and friendly understanding between India and the Soviet Union. A relationship which has flourished over the years and has become even stronger.  <br />Radhakrishnan was elected Vice-President of India in 1952. The Vice-President presides over the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) sessions, much like the Speaker does in the Lok Sabha (Lower House). Often, during a heated debate, Radhakrishnan would intervene with slokas from the sanskrit classics or quotations from the Bible to calm the charged atmosphere. Nehru commented later, "By the way in which Radhakrishnan conducted the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha, he had made the meetings of the House look like family gatherings!"  <br />Dr. Radhakrishnan was honored with the Bharat Ratna in 1954. Around the same time, an 883-page compilation titled "The Philosophy of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan" was released in America.  <br />In 1956, Radhakrishnan's devoted wife, Sivakamuamma, passed away after sharing 50 years of married life. The couple had five daughters and a son.  <br />After serving two terms as Vice-President, Radhakrishnan was elected President of India in 1962. Radhakrishnan's tenure as President was marked by thedisastrous Indo-China war of 1962, his state visit to the United States in1963, the end of the Nehru-era with Nehru's death in 1964, and India's victorious performance against Pakistan in 1965 under Lal Bahadur Shastri. Radhakrishnan guided each of the Prime Ministers wisely and helped see India through those trying years safely. Radhakrishnan refused to continue for another term as President after his term ended in 1967.  <br />At the age of 79, Dr. Radhakrishnan returned to Madras in May 1967 to a warm homecoming. He spent his last years happily at his house "Girija" in Mylapore, Madras.  <br />Dr. Radhakrishnan died on April 17, 1975.<br /> Courtesy: Wiki &amp; some websites</p>
