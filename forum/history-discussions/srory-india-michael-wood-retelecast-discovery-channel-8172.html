I took an interest into inscriptions initially, but location (outside india), access to works ( books) and access to sites + lack of profeciency in tamil &amp; sanskrit were all major handicaps.

<p>     I am no expert in this, what little i have learnt if from interaction with member of this group. </p>
<p>     I am bringing forward a post by one of our member - Vira rajendra below:</p>
<p>     quote:</p>
<p>     "<br />     Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military acadamy and arsenal centre. </p>
<p>     This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of Vilignam. "</p>

He has 3 types of Meikeerthis and all give the importance tothe first victory over chera. His?4th year is 988 AD. At that time the Chera King was Baskara Ravivarman Tiruvadi(978 - 1036) and his inscriptions are found in Tirunangur. So Rajarajan won the Chera King in 988 AD.? . Am I correct ???

<p>        Dear SPS uncle, Sorry to differ also from you. The temple is not named after the King. The King was named after the Rajarajeswaram Temple. <br />        ???? The Big Temple has the Maha Meru on its top. There are8 important gods standing on it looking on 8 directions. They are? Anandhan, Sukchuman, Sivothaman, Ekanethran, Ekaruthran, Thrimurthy, Seekandan, Sikandi and these gods assist the Lord Sivam to control and operate the Ichai, Kiriyai and Gnanam sakthis of the universe. They are called? Rajarajeswarars. Rajarjeswara? is the nameof the post given by Sivam for his assistants. He orders and control them.? That is why the temple is called Rajarajeswaram and Arulmozhi Varman was named Rajarajacholan.<br />        ???? "Sree Rajarajechurm udayar Sree Vimanam Pon meivithan Sree Rajaraja Devar" was the sentence inscribed in the Gopuram inside wall which was found by Dr.K.Nagasamy and Kudavasal Uncle around 1997 and a artila temple also named like this.<br />        ????

<p>   ?????????TA Gopinatha Rao identified that a ?part ofTrivandrum, now named as Valiya salai was Kanthalur Salai which is away from Vilignam.?</p>
<p>   ??????? The second session of battle after 10 years against Chera and Pandya at Udagai is? different and not connected to the firstone.? ---- Correct me, if I am wrong,please.</p>

<p>   Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military acadamy and arsenal centre. </p>
<p>   This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the yearA.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of Vilignam. "</p>

<p>      Dear SPS uncle, Sorry to differ also from you. The temple is not named after the King. The King was named after the Rajarajeswaram Temple. </p>
<p>      ???? The Big Temple has the Maha Meru on its top. There are 8important gods standing on it looking on 8 directions. They are? Anandhan, Sukchuman, Sivothaman, Ekanethran, Ekaruthran, Thrimurthy, Seekandan, Sikandi and these gods assist the Lord Sivam to control and operate the Ichai, Kiriyai and Gnanam sakthis of the universe. They are called? Rajarajeswarars. Rajarjeswara? is the nameof the post given by Sivam for his assistants. He orders and control them.? That is why the temple is called Rajarajeswaram and Arulmozhi Varman was named Rajarajacholan.</p>
<p>      ???? "Sree Rajarajechurm udayar Sree Vimanam Pon meivithan Sree Rajaraja Devar" was the sentence inscribed in the Gopuram inside wall which was found by Dr.K.Nagasamy and Kudavasal Uncle around 1997 and a articltemple also named like this.</p>

<p>    Its nice to see youngsters like you take these up. ( appo naangellam old aa, athu sari, sps sir uncle na naan anna ok). I took an interest into inscriptions initially, but location (outside india), access to works ( books) and access to sites + lack of profeciency in tamil &amp; sanskrit were all major handicaps. So conveniently moved my focus to sculpture. </p>
<p>    Maybe, you can start listing the important inscriptions of Arulmozhi - we can even list them from his year of reign. </p>

<p>  ? <br />  hi madhu</p>
<p>  Its nice to see youngsters like you take these up. ( appo naangellam old aa, athu sari, sps sir uncle na naan anna ok). I took an interest into inscriptions initially, but location (outside india), access to works ( books) and access to sites + lack of profeciency in tamil &amp; sanskrit were all major handicaps. So conveniently moved my focus to sculpture. </p>
<p>  Maybe, you can start listing the important inscriptions of Arulmozhi - wecan even list them from his year of reign. </p>

<p>   I am no expert in this, what little i have learnt if from interaction with member of this group. </p>
<p>   I am bringing forward a post by one of our member - Vira rajendra below:</p>
<p>   quote:</p>
<p>   "<br />   Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military acadamy and arsenal centre. </p>
<p>   This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the yearA.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of Vilignam. "</p>

He has 3 types of Meikeerthis and all give the importance tothe first victory over chera. His?4th year is 988 AD. At that time the Chera King was Baskara Ravivarman Tiruvadi (978 - 1036) and his inscriptions are found in Tirunangur. So Rajarajan won the Chera King in 988 AD.? . Am I correct ???

<p>  Its nice to see youngsters like you take these up. ( appo naangellam old aa, athu sari, sps sir uncle na naan anna ok). I took an interest into inscriptions initially, but location (outside india), access to works ( books) and access to sites + lack of profeciency in tamil &amp; sanskrit were all major handicaps. So conveniently moved my focus to sculpture. </p>
<p>  Maybe, you can start listing the important inscriptions of Arulmozhi - wecan even list them from his year of reign. </p>

Tiruvalangadu plates tells about Rajarajan's victory over Amarapujangan. But the inscriptions found in Kerala is 2 years earlier than the inscriptions in Tirunelveli.

<p>   I am no expert in this, what little i have learnt if from interaction with member of this group. </p>
<p>   I am bringing forward a post by one of our member - Vira rajendra below:</p>
<p>   quote:</p>
<p>   "<br />   Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military acadamy and arsenal centre. </p>
<p>   This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the yearA.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of Vilignam. "</p>

<p>    -how would u date the victory over chera to 988 AD?-<br />    ???? Rajarajan was crowned around 25th June 985 AD. His first war and victory was mentioned in his 4th year inscription and ?'Kanthalur Salai Kalamarutha. ..'?? in his Meikeerthi. He has 3 types of Meikeerthis and all give the importance tothe first victory over chera. His?4th year is 988 AD. At that time the Chera King was Baskara Ravivarman Tiruvadi (978 - 1036) and his inscriptions are found in Tirunangur. So Rajarajan won the Chera King in 988 AD.? . Am I correct ???

<p>     Yes. I think I know. The other gopurams are Keralandhagan Thiruvayil and Rajarajan Tiruvayil. Keralandhagan Tiruvayil was taken for the victory against Bhaskara Ravivarman in 988AD.? This gopuram contains the rare sculpture of Siva with 5 heads and 10 hands. The Rajarajan tiruvayil has the 18ft. tall? single stone dwarapalakas . And it contains the stories from Sivapuranam and a temple for Indran. This is all I know,<br />     ???

<p>      Dear SPS uncle, Sorry to differ also from you. The temple is not named after the King. The King was named after the Rajarajeswaram Temple. <br />      ???? The Big Temple has the Maha Meru on its top. There are 8important gods standing on it looking on 8 directions. They are? Anandhan, Sukchuman, Sivothaman, Ekanethran, Ekaruthran, Thrimurthy, Seekandan, Sikandi and these gods assist the Lord Sivam to control and operate the Ichai, Kiriyai and Gnanam sakthis of the universe. They are called? Rajarajeswarars. Rajarjeswara? is the nameof the post given by Sivam for his assistants. He orders and control them.? That is why the temple is called Rajarajeswaram and Arulmozhi Varman was named Rajarajacholan.<br />      ???? "Sree Rajarajechurm udayar Sree Vimanam Pon meivithan Sree Rajaraja Devar" was the sentence inscribed in the Gopuram inside wall which was found by Dr.K.Nagasamy and Kudavasal Uncle around 1997 and a articltemple also named like this.<br />      ????

I was very scared as i thought i was going to meet a white bearded, kurta wearing, jolna bag totting, 70 year old man. That was the picture i had conjured up of Mr.Venkatesh. :) :)<br />Shocked to see a very smart, brief case totting executive look-alike Mr.Venketesh.

This came from my childhood and not because of others age etc.<br />???? I have some collections of Rajarajan's inscriptions and all ofthem are at home in Chennai. After my return I will try to send them to you. I have? also collected the 42? Rajarajan's inscriptional names. <br />???? I am also week in Tamil and what is sanskrit?

<p>? <br />hi madhu</p>
<p>Its nice to see youngsters like you take these up. ( appo naangellam old aa, athu sari, sps sir uncle na naan anna ok). I took an interest into inscriptions initially, but location (outside india), access to works ( books) and access to sites + lack of profeciency in tamil &amp; sanskrit were all major handicaps. So conveniently moved my focus to sculpture. </p>
<p>Maybe, you can start listing the important inscriptions of Arulmozhi - we can even list them from his year of reign. </p>

        <p>Hi VJ Anna,<br />???????? Kanthalur Salai is just south of Vilignam. Kanthalur?would have been ?under Pandya and later came under Chera along with Vilignam. First war of Rajaraja was against Amarapujanga Pandyan.and the war started at Kanthalur and came down to Tirunelveli.? <br />???????? Tiruvalangadu plates tells about Rajarajan's victory over Amarapujangan. But the inscriptions found in Kerala is 2 years earlier than the inscriptions in Tirunelveli. So, the first battle of Rajarajanshould have started from Kanthalur.and came down to South?= This is what Venkiah writes in the prefcre of SII 2.<br />?????????TA Gopinatha Rao identified that a ?part of Trivandrum, now named as Valiya salai was Kanthalur Salai which is away from Vilignam.?<br />??????? The second session of battle after 10 years against Chera and Pandya at Udagai is? different and not connected to the first one.? ---- Correct me, if I am wrong,please.<br />Madhu<br />???? </p>

<p>? <br />hi madhu</p>
<p>I am no expert in this, what little i have learnt if from interaction with member of this group. </p>
<p>I am bringing forward a post by one of our member - Vira rajendra below:</p>
<p>quote:</p>
<p>"<br />Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in A.D.988, andit appears he only partly destroyed this military acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military acadamy and arsenal centre. </p>
<p>This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of Vilignam. "</p>

This gopuram contains the rare sculpture of Siva with 5 heads and 10 hands. The Rajarajan tiruvayil has the 18 ft. tall? single stone dwarapalakas .

<p>   Dear SPS uncle, Sorry to differ also from you. The temple is not named after the King. The King was named after the Rajarajeswaram Temple. <br />   ???? The Big Temple has the Maha Meru on its top. There are 8 important gods standing on it looking on 8 directions. They are? Anandhan, Sukchuman, Sivothaman, Ekanethran, Ekaruthran, Thrimurthy, Seekandan, Sikandi and these gods assist the Lord Sivam to control and operate the Ichai, Kiriyai and Gnanam sakthis of the universe. They are called? Rajarajeswarars. Rajarjeswara? is the nameof the post given by Sivam for his assistants. He orders and control them.? That is why the temple is called Rajarajeswaram and Arulmozhi Varman was named Rajarajacholan.<br />   ???? "Sree Rajarajechurm udayar Sree Vimanam Pon meivithan Sree Rajaraja Devar" was the sentence inscribed in the Gopuram inside wall whichwas found by Dr.K.Nagasamy and Kudavasal Uncle around 1997 and a article wmple also named like this.<br />   ????

Anandhan, Sukchuman, Sivothaman, Ekanethran, Ekaruthran, Thrimurthy, Seekandan, Sikandi and these gods assist the Lord Sivam to control and operate the Ichai, Kiriyai and Gnanam sakthis of the universe. They are called? Rajarajeswarars. Rajarjeswara? is the nameof the post given by Sivam for his assistants. He orders and control them.? That is why the temple is called Rajarajeswaram and Arulmozhi Varman was named Rajarajacholan.<br />  ???? "Sree Rajarajechurm udayar Sree Vimanam Pon meivithan Sree Rajaraja Devar" was the sentence inscribed in the Gopuram inside wall which was found by Dr.K.Nagasamy and Kudavasal Uncle around 1997 and a article waple also named like this.<br />  ???? Kindly correct me if I am wrong.<br />  Madhu</p>

        <p>Yes. I think I know. The other gopurams are Keralandhagan Thiruvayil and Rajarajan Tiruvayil. Keralandhagan Tiruvayil was taken for the victory against Bhaskara Ravivarman in 988AD.? This gopuram contains the rare sculptureof Siva with 5 heads and 10 hands. The Rajarajan tiruvayil has the 18 ft. tall? single stone dwarapalakas . And it contains the stories from Sivapuranam and a temple for Indran. This is all I know,<br />??? Other than Big temple inscriptions, is there any other inscription mentioning the name Rajarajan before completing the temple?<br />Madhu</p>

The Big Temple has the Maha Meru on its top. There are 8 important gods standing on it looking on 8 directions. They are? Anandhan, Sukchuman, Sivothaman, Ekanethran, Ekaruthran, Thrimurthy, Seekandan, Sikandi and these gods assist the Lord Sivam to control and operate the Ichai, Kiriyai and Gnanam sakthis of the universe. They are called? Rajarajeswarars.Rajarjeswara? is the nameof the post given by Sivam for his assistants. He orders and control them.? That is why the temple is called Rajarajeswaram and Arulmozhi Varman was named Rajarajacholan.<br />???? "Sree Rajarajechurm udayar Sree Vimanam Pon meivithan Sree Rajaraja Devar" was the sentence inscribed in the Gopuram inside wall which was found by Dr.K.Nagasamy and Kudavasal Uncle around 1997 and a article was e also named like this.<br />???? Kindly correct me if I am wrong.<br />Madhu</p>

<p>===================================<br />Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Last 18th Sept (2005) - Sunday, I met Dr. Kudavoil Balasubramanian to collect the details of Tiruvarur inscriptions as desired by our Kamal (Not heardfrom him for long !?) on Golden roofing. Also asked him why did Rajaraja II chose to golden roof Tiruveezhi mizhalai.</p>
<p>Kudavoil Balu Sir narrated the following :</p>
<p>Mahavishnu performed Puja to Siva in this place with 999 lotus flowers and was falling short of one to complete 1000 and he used his eye (which was normally described Lotus).</p>
<p>The Sivalingam which came out of that Tiruveezhimazhalai was NAMED AS<br />RAJARAJA BY LORD VISHNU HIMSELF !</p>
<p>THAT is the reason why, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's grand son chose to Gold roof this temple with100000 (One Lakhs) Kazhanju PURE GOLD (Tiruvarur Golden roofing By <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  wason Copper sheets. Here No copper sheet! Full of Gold sheets / foils!).</p>
<p>Dr. Kkvn already wrote that Rajasimhan - Pallavan - role model of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  - creator of Adyanthakaamam - Kailasam - was also known as <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  (Raja Rajan !) !</p>
<p>So <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  selected the best of the names to identify his goals!</p>
<p>Adding now::</p>
<p>TO KNOW MORE OF THESE THINGS, Knowledge of Religeous texts, scope to compare with other literatures etc., is must.</p>

<p>         freinds,<br />         michael wood-a contemporary historiographer of oxford university has made<br />       a fantastic modern potrayal of indian history. a six part programme now<br />       being retelecasted in discovery channel. the six parts are<br />         1.the beginnings: traces earliest human arrival and madurai genogramme<br />       study, the kerala brahmins vedic ritual practice, indus valley, and aryan<br />       arrival from tajikistan.</p>
<p>         2.the contacts and trade with external world: the thiruvanchikulam- roman<br />       connections, madurai, the kanishka empire are described.</p>
<p>         3. age of reasoning: advent of buddhism and asoka's history traced.</p>
<p>         4. age of gold: the gupta period and the cholan period are shown. dr.wood<br />       has paid encomiums to cholan and tamil heritage for 40 minutes of the 60<br />       minute programme. wood calls cholamandalam as a model for the culture of<br />       india as a whole. even to the extent of calling it as a wonder of the world!</p>
<p>         5. meeting of oceans: arrival of islam and muslim empires are discussed.<br />         6. modern period: the arrival of europeans and the english<br />       paramountancy, independence and post independent emerging free market india.</p>
<p>         michael wood's sereis is a masterpiece in history. future indologists and<br />       tamilologists will have to quote this documentary programme. i wish all of<br />       us see this or buy the CD available in chennai .</p>

<p>       freinds,<br />       michael wood-a contemporary historiographer of oxford university hasmade<br />     a fantastic modern potrayal of indian history. a six part programme now<br />     being retelecasted in discovery channel. the six parts are<br />       1.the beginnings: traces earliest human arrival and madurai genogramme<br />     study, the kerala brahmins vedic ritual practice, indus valley, and aryan<br />     arrival from tajikistan.</p>
<p>       2.the contacts and trade with external world: the thiruvanchikulam- roman<br />     connections, madurai, the kanishka empire are described.</p>
<p>       3. age of reasoning: advent of buddhism and asoka's history traced.</p>
<p>       4. age of gold: the gupta period and the cholan period are shown. dr.wood<br />     has paid encomiums to cholan and tamil heritage for 40 minutes of the 60<br />     minute programme. wood calls cholamandalam as a model for the culture of<br />     india as a whole. even to the extent of calling it as a wonder of the world!</p>
<p>       5. meeting of oceans: arrival of islam and muslim empires are discussed.<br />       6. modern period: the arrival of europeans and the english<br />     paramountancy, independence and post independent emerging free market india.</p>
<p>       michael wood's sereis is a masterpiece in history. future indologists and<br />     tamilologists will have to quote this documentary programme. i wish all of<br />     us see this or buy the CD available in chennai .</p>

<p>freinds,<br />michael wood-a contemporary historiographer of oxford university has made afantastic modern potrayal of indian history. a six part programme now being retelecasted in discovery channel. the six parts are<br />1.the beginnings: traces earliest human arrival and madurai genogramme study, the kerala brahmins vedic ritual practice, indus valley, and aryan arrival from tajikistan.</p>
<p>2.the contacts and trade with external world: the thiruvanchikulam-roman connections,madurai, the kanishka empire are described.</p>
<p>3. age of reasoning: advent of buddhism and asoka's history traced.</p>
<p>4. age of gold: the gupta period and the cholan period are shown. dr.wood has paid encomiums to cholan and tamil heritage for 40 minutes of the 60 minute programme. wood calls cholamandalam as a model for the culture of indiaas a whole. even to the extent of calling it as a wonder of the world!</p>
<p>5. meeting of oceans: arrival of islam and muslim empires are discussed.<br />6. modern period: the arrival of europeans and the english paramountancy,independence and post independent emerging free market india.</p>
<p>michael wood's sereis is a masterpiece in history. future indologists and tamilologists will have to quote this documentary programme. i wish all of us see this or buy the CD available in chennai .</p>

        <p>This is an exceptional program worth watching.</p>
<p>M.</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "gandhi" <gandhiram@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  freinds,<br />  michael wood-a contemporary historiographer of oxford university has madea fantastic modern potrayal of indian history. a six part programme now being retelecasted in discovery channel. the six parts are<br />  1.the beginnings: traces earliest human arrival and madurai genogramme study, the kerala brahmins vedic ritual practice, indus valley, and aryan arrival from tajikistan.</p>
<p>  2.the contacts and trade with external world: the thiruvanchikulam-roman connections,madurai, the kanishka empire are described.</p>
<p>  3. age of reasoning: advent of buddhism and asoka's history traced.</p>
<p>  4. age of gold: the gupta period and the cholan period are shown. dr.woodhas paid encomiums to cholan and tamil heritage for 40 minutes of the 60 minute programme. wood calls cholamandalam as a model for the culture of india as a whole. even to the extent of calling it as a wonder of the world!</p>
<p>  5. meeting of oceans: arrival of islam and muslim empires are discussed.<br />  6. modern period: the arrival of europeans and the english paramountancy,independence and post independent emerging free market india.</p>
<p>  michael wood's sereis is a masterpiece in history. future indologists andtamilologists will have to quote this documentary programme. i wish all ofus see this or buy the CD available in chennai .</p>
