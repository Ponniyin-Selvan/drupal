<p>Through the ages numerous wars and battles have been fought to <br />conquer both lands and people. The need to defend property against <br />marauders gave rise to an architectural renaissance and numerous <br />castles, forts and battlements were built. </p>
<p>As time progressed, so too did the refinement in construction and the <br />architecture became ornate and spectacular in dimension and <br />aesthetics. During periods of peace beautiful "mahals" were built <br />inside these forts for the pleasures of the ruling princes and their <br />feudal Lords. With the passage of time and the historical changes in <br />governance and political systems, these forts and palaces fell into <br />decay. It became virtually impossible for their erstwhile owners to <br />maintain either the edifices or their rich traditional past. </p>
<p>With the aim to try and revive the rich cultural and traditional pat, <br />the Indian Heritage Hotels Association came into being in 1990. </p>
<p>A few palaces, forts and havelis became the founder members and so <br />started a legacy in preserving and reviving our rich Heritage. The <br />concept of being able to enjoy the luxuries and majesty of an era <br />gone by holds great allure to the world tourist. <br />The entire experience of a festival, fair, folk dance and music or <br />the adventure of a camel or horse safari or a jeep ride into the <br />countryside be it a forest or desert, give immense pleasure, novelty <br />and mystery to an international tourist.</p>
<p>The Heritage Hotels have successfully given a new dimension to world <br />tourism. Each property being different makes very destination unique <br />and every experience a new one.</p>
<p>The concept of the Association is to preserve these properties from <br />decay has been a singularly successful proposition. It has also <br />marked India as a "Heritage destination of International Heritage <br />Tourism". The Heritage Hotels scheme has created immense interest and <br />it has great potential to snowball into something bigger. </p>
<p>It has generated substantial economic activity and employment, <br />particularly in lesser developed rural areas where many of these <br />properties are located. Heritage Hotels are an important source of <br />foreign exchange earnings in these otherwise back regions.</p>
<p>It has become difficult to maintain these magnificent properties, <br />each individually created over centuries, adorned with the best <br />paintings and furniture, and representing different periods of <br />architectural history, were in danger of falling to ruin, even though <br />most continued to serve as residences for the former members of the <br />royal families. </p>
<p>Of the 22 princely states of rajastan and innumerable thikanas or <br />seats of residence of the aristocracy, a small clutch of them have <br />been converted into heritage hotels. With their recent conversion <br />into hotels, they have managed to keep their flavour as medieval <br />homes intact, these once forbidden deras have opened their doors to <br />the world. An in doing so, they have ensured that the properties <br />continue to be maintained in a befitting manner, and that a way of <br />living that was losing ground to the 21st century, has been preserved <br />for a little while longer.</p>
<p>India has always been an exotic land, a country that the Western <br />World fantasised about. Here were to be found the martial races that <br />ruled India, tracing their lineage from the warring Gods, and known <br />for their aestheticism as well as their chivalry. </p>
<p>In a country such as India where nature takes its toll annually, much <br />because of droughts and floods, the rulers often commissioned their <br />greatest architectural monuments- forts, palaces, temples - to ensure <br />employment and food for the poorest.</p>
<p>At the time of independence in 1947, all the states merged into the <br />republic of India, and a modern, democratic nation was born. The <br />royal families were de-recognised by the Constitution of India in <br />1971, and their privileges withdrawn. Fortunately, the lifestyle they <br />represented, ingrained over centuries, has remained untouched.</p>
<p>Scions of the great dynasties that once ruled over independent <br />states continue to live graciously, though they are now <br />industrialists, professionals, even hoteliers. The premium positions <br />they occupied by birth have now been replaced by merit, but for those <br />who have managed to convert their ancestral homes into hotels, the <br />ways of the past have become a charming reminder of the spirit now <br />reflected in these heritage properties.</p>
<p>A number of Heritage properties are located in Rajasthan. For all <br />one's inclination to believe that Rajasthan is a desert, it is <br />difficult to ignore the fact that the region, in fact, has a varied <br />topography, and includes semi-arid, desert like conditions amongst <br />the oldest mountains in the world, and lush, water-filled valleys. <br />Its wildlife is rich in variety, from the tiger the leopard to <br />endless varieties of deer, rhesus monkeys, reptiles including the <br />python, and a profusion of bird-life that includes water-birds find <br />their home here.</p>
<p>Fairs and festivals are celebrated throughout India. A visit to a <br />Heritage Hotels ensures an experience into the rural life of India, <br />the diverse cuisine, festivals, sports and cultural packages of their <br />varied courtesy. Historic destinations, religious centres, <br />architectural splendour and wildlife and eco-tourism can all be <br />enjoyed with a special traditional flavour. </p>
<p>Film makers, photographers, convention participants and everyday <br />tourists each find a paradise at these majestic properties of the <br />Heritage Hotels in India.</p>
<p>India. An ancient civilisation. With an impressive lineage that over <br />the centuries has amassed a tremendous wealth of grandeur and majesty.<br />To truly experience this royal lineage, come stay at the Heritage <br />Hotels. </p>
<p>A select group of palaces, forts and havelis that have been converted <br />into wonderful hotels, retaining their age old flavour and charm. The <br />Heritage Hotels - for those who want to travel down the ages and live <br />in a style befitting Rajahs and Maharajas.</p>
<p>In a fairy tale land of majestic palaces, fortresses, cities, and <br />hotchpotch bazaars. In palaces and forts that have withstood the <br />toughest cannonballs and inclement weather. Properties that have <br />tingling tales of bravura and princely extravagance.</p>
<p>With Bawarchis and Khansamas' to conjure up delicious cuisine and <br />prepare age old recipes.</p>
<p>The Heritage Hotels. Unlike any other group anywhere in the world. <br />Because they are India's Royal Legacy. Now yours to experience.</p>

<p>Through the ages numerous wars and battles have been fought to <br />conquer both lands and people. The need to defend property against <br />marauders gave rise to an architectural renaissance and numerous <br />castles, forts and battlements were built. </p>
<p>As time progressed, so too did the refinement in construction and the <br />architecture became ornate and spectacular in dimension and <br />aesthetics. During periods of peace beautiful "mahals" were built <br />inside these forts for the pleasures of the ruling princes and their <br />feudal Lords. With the passage of time and the historical changes in <br />governance and political systems, these forts and palaces fell into <br />decay. It became virtually impossible for their erstwhile owners to <br />maintain either the edifices or their rich traditional past. </p>
<p>With the aim to try and revive the rich cultural and traditional pat, <br />the Indian Heritage Hotels Association came into being in 1990. </p>
<p>A few palaces, forts and havelis became the founder members and so <br />started a legacy in preserving and reviving our rich Heritage. The <br />concept of being able to enjoy the luxuries and majesty of an era <br />gone by holds great allure to the world tourist. <br />The entire experience of a festival, fair, folk dance and music or <br />the adventure of a camel or horse safari or a jeep ride into the <br />countryside be it a forest or desert, give immense pleasure, novelty <br />and mystery to an international tourist.</p>
<p>The Heritage Hotels have successfully given a new dimension to world <br />tourism. Each property being different makes very destination unique <br />and every experience a new one.</p>
<p>The concept of the Association is to preserve these properties from <br />decay has been a singularly successful proposition. It has also <br />marked India as a "Heritage destination of International Heritage <br />Tourism". The Heritage Hotels scheme has created immense interest and <br />it has great potential to snowball into something bigger. </p>
<p>It has generated substantial economic activity and employment, <br />particularly in lesser developed rural areas where many of these <br />properties are located. Heritage Hotels are an important source of <br />foreign exchange earnings in these otherwise back regions.</p>
<p>It has become difficult to maintain these magnificent properties, <br />each individually created over centuries, adorned with the best <br />paintings and furniture, and representing different periods of <br />architectural history, were in danger of falling to ruin, even though <br />most continued to serve as residences for the former members of the <br />royal families. </p>
<p>Of the 22 princely states of rajastan and innumerable thikanas or <br />seats of residence of the aristocracy, a small clutch of them have <br />been converted into heritage hotels. With their recent conversion <br />into hotels, they have managed to keep their flavour as medieval <br />homes intact, these once forbidden deras have opened their doors to <br />the world. An in doing so, they have ensured that the properties <br />continue to be maintained in a befitting manner, and that a way of <br />living that was losing ground to the 21st century, has been preserved <br />for a little while longer.</p>
<p>India has always been an exotic land, a country that the Western <br />World fantasised about. Here were to be found the martial races that <br />ruled India, tracing their lineage from the warring Gods, and known <br />for their aestheticism as well as their chivalry. </p>
<p>In a country such as India where nature takes its toll annually, much <br />because of droughts and floods, the rulers often commissioned their <br />greatest architectural monuments- forts, palaces, temples - to ensure <br />employment and food for the poorest.</p>
<p>At the time of independence in 1947, all the states merged into the <br />republic of India, and a modern, democratic nation was born. The <br />royal families were de-recognised by the Constitution of India in <br />1971, and their privileges withdrawn. Fortunately, the lifestyle they <br />represented, ingrained over centuries, has remained untouched.</p>
<p>Scions of the great dynasties that once ruled over independent <br />states continue to live graciously, though they are now <br />industrialists, professionals, even hoteliers. The premium positions <br />they occupied by birth have now been replaced by merit, but for those <br />who have managed to convert their ancestral homes into hotels, the <br />ways of the past have become a charming reminder of the spirit now <br />reflected in these heritage properties.</p>
<p>A number of Heritage properties are located in Rajasthan. For all <br />one's inclination to believe that Rajasthan is a desert, it is <br />difficult to ignore the fact that the region, in fact, has a varied <br />topography, and includes semi-arid, desert like conditions amongst <br />the oldest mountains in the world, and lush, water-filled valleys. <br />Its wildlife is rich in variety, from the tiger the leopard to <br />endless varieties of deer, rhesus monkeys, reptiles including the <br />python, and a profusion of bird-life that includes water-birds find <br />their home here.</p>
<p>Fairs and festivals are celebrated throughout India. A visit to a <br />Heritage Hotels ensures an experience into the rural life of India, <br />the diverse cuisine, festivals, sports and cultural packages of their <br />varied courtesy. Historic destinations, religious centres, <br />architectural splendour and wildlife and eco-tourism can all be <br />enjoyed with a special traditional flavour. </p>
<p>Film makers, photographers, convention participants and everyday <br />tourists each find a paradise at these majestic properties of the <br />Heritage Hotels in India.</p>
<p>India. An ancient civilisation. With an impressive lineage that over <br />the centuries has amassed a tremendous wealth of grandeur and majesty.<br />To truly experience this royal lineage, come stay at the Heritage <br />Hotels. </p>
<p>A select group of palaces, forts and havelis that have been converted <br />into wonderful hotels, retaining their age old flavour and charm. The <br />Heritage Hotels - for those who want to travel down the ages and live <br />in a style befitting Rajahs and Maharajas.</p>
<p>In a fairy tale land of majestic palaces, fortresses, cities, and <br />hotchpotch bazaars. In palaces and forts that have withstood the <br />toughest cannonballs and inclement weather. Properties that have <br />tingling tales of bravura and princely extravagance.</p>
<p>With Bawarchis and Khansamas' to conjure up delicious cuisine and <br />prepare age old recipes.</p>
<p>The Heritage Hotels. Unlike any other group anywhere in the world. <br />Because they are India's Royal Legacy. Now yours to experience.</p>

<p>  Through the ages numerous wars and battles have been fought to <br />  conquer both lands and people. The need to defend property against <br />  marauders gave rise to an architectural renaissance and numerous <br />  castles, forts and battlements were built. </p>
<p>  As time progressed, so too did the refinement in construction and <br />the <br />  architecture became ornate and spectacular in dimension and <br />  aesthetics. During periods of peace beautiful "mahals" were built <br />  inside these forts for the pleasures of the ruling princes and <br />their <br />  feudal Lords. With the passage of time and the historical changes <br />in <br />  governance and political systems, these forts and palaces fell <br />into <br />  decay. It became virtually impossible for their erstwhile owners <br />to <br />  maintain either the edifices or their rich traditional past. </p>
<p>  With the aim to try and revive the rich cultural and traditional <br />pat, <br />  the Indian Heritage Hotels Association came into being in 1990. </p>
<p>  A few palaces, forts and havelis became the founder members and so <br />  started a legacy in preserving and reviving our rich Heritage. The <br />  concept of being able to enjoy the luxuries and majesty of an era <br />  gone by holds great allure to the world tourist. <br />  The entire experience of a festival, fair, folk dance and music or <br />  the adventure of a camel or horse safari or a jeep ride into the <br />  countryside be it a forest or desert, give immense pleasure, <br />novelty <br />  and mystery to an international tourist.</p>
<p>  The Heritage Hotels have successfully given a new dimension to <br />world <br />  tourism. Each property being different makes very destination <br />unique <br />  and every experience a new one.</p>
<p>  The concept of the Association is to preserve these properties <br />from <br />  decay has been a singularly successful proposition. It has also <br />  marked India as a "Heritage destination of International Heritage <br />  Tourism". The Heritage Hotels scheme has created immense interest <br />and <br />  it has great potential to snowball into something bigger. </p>
<p>  It has generated substantial economic activity and employment, <br />  particularly in lesser developed rural areas where many of these <br />  properties are located. Heritage Hotels are an important source of <br />  foreign exchange earnings in these otherwise back regions.</p>
<p>  It has become difficult to maintain these magnificent properties, <br />  each individually created over centuries, adorned with the best <br />  paintings and furniture, and representing different periods of <br />  architectural history, were in danger of falling to ruin, even <br />though <br />  most continued to serve as residences for the former members of <br />the <br />  royal families. </p>
<p>  Of the 22 princely states of rajastan and innumerable thikanas or <br />  seats of residence of the aristocracy, a small clutch of them have <br />  been converted into heritage hotels. With their recent conversion <br />  into hotels, they have managed to keep their flavour as medieval <br />  homes intact, these once forbidden deras have opened their doors <br />to <br />  the world. An in doing so, they have ensured that the properties <br />  continue to be maintained in a befitting manner, and that a way of <br />  living that was losing ground to the 21st century, has been <br />preserved <br />  for a little while longer.</p>
<p>  India has always been an exotic land, a country that the Western <br />  World fantasised about. Here were to be found the martial races <br />that <br />  ruled India, tracing their lineage from the warring Gods, and <br />known <br />  for their aestheticism as well as their chivalry. </p>
<p>  In a country such as India where nature takes its toll annually, <br />much <br />  because of droughts and floods, the rulers often commissioned <br />their <br />  greatest architectural monuments- forts, palaces, temples - to <br />ensure <br />  employment and food for the poorest.</p>
<p>  At the time of independence in 1947, all the states merged into <br />the <br />  republic of India, and a modern, democratic nation was born. The <br />  royal families were de-recognised by the Constitution of India in <br />  1971, and their privileges withdrawn. Fortunately, the lifestyle <br />they <br />  represented, ingrained over centuries, has remained untouched.</p>
<p>  Scions of the great dynasties that once ruled over independent <br />  states continue to live graciously, though they are now <br />  industrialists, professionals, even hoteliers. The premium <br />positions <br />  they occupied by birth have now been replaced by merit, but for <br />those <br />  who have managed to convert their ancestral homes into hotels, the <br />  ways of the past have become a charming reminder of the spirit now <br />  reflected in these heritage properties.</p>
<p>  A number of Heritage properties are located in Rajasthan. For all <br />  one's inclination to believe that Rajasthan is a desert, it is <br />  difficult to ignore the fact that the region, in fact, has a <br />varied <br />  topography, and includes semi-arid, desert like conditions amongst <br />  the oldest mountains in the world, and lush, water-filled valleys. <br />  Its wildlife is rich in variety, from the tiger the leopard to <br />  endless varieties of deer, rhesus monkeys, reptiles including the <br />  python, and a profusion of bird-life that includes water-birds <br />find <br />  their home here.</p>
<p>  Fairs and festivals are celebrated throughout India. A visit to a <br />  Heritage Hotels ensures an experience into the rural life of <br />India, <br />  the diverse cuisine, festivals, sports and cultural packages of <br />their <br />  varied courtesy. Historic destinations, religious centres, <br />  architectural splendour and wildlife and eco-tourism can all be <br />  enjoyed with a special traditional flavour. </p>
<p>  Film makers, photographers, convention participants and everyday <br />  tourists each find a paradise at these majestic properties of the <br />  Heritage Hotels in India.</p>
<p>  India. An ancient civilisation. With an impressive lineage that <br />over <br />  the centuries has amassed a tremendous wealth of grandeur and <br />majesty.<br />  To truly experience this royal lineage, come stay at the Heritage <br />  Hotels. </p>
<p>  A select group of palaces, forts and havelis that have been <br />converted <br />  into wonderful hotels, retaining their age old flavour and charm. <br />The <br />  Heritage Hotels - for those who want to travel down the ages and <br />live <br />  in a style befitting Rajahs and Maharajas.</p>
<p>  In a fairy tale land of majestic palaces, fortresses, cities, and <br />  hotchpotch bazaars. In palaces and forts that have withstood the <br />  toughest cannonballs and inclement weather. Properties that have <br />  tingling tales of bravura and princely extravagance.</p>
<p>  With Bawarchis and Khansamas' to conjure up delicious cuisine and <br />  prepare age old recipes.</p>
<p>  The Heritage Hotels. Unlike any other group anywhere in the world. <br />  Because they are India's Royal Legacy. Now yours to experience.</p>
