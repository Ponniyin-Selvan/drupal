</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I am sure this will raise some hackles but that never stopped me before. :)<br />I do believe that Vanthiyathevan, as portrayed by Kalki in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is one of the<br />less "heroic" heros that I have read in any book. He is more like a bumbling<br />fool, albeit a very lucky one. He mostly has others come and bail him out of<br />difficulties. Time and again, he stumbles across things and events more or<br />less catch up to him rather than his shaping things. Maybe Kalki wanted to<br />portray exactly that.. that he was like a leaf caught in the Chola<br />war-of-succession maelstrom but that's what it looks like to me.</acronym></p>

        <p>Well I am rereading it now..

<p>now YOU tell me what particular aspect of his intelligence and verve and wit<br />has Vanthiyathevan demonstrated here :)</p>

<p>  If we belive that a hero deinitely has to do<br />  everything by himself, then Vandhiyadevan may not be<br />  the choice.</p>
<p>  He is defnitley lucky but not a bumbling idiot. The<br />  way the stoy goes, it gives me a feeling that he uses<br />  his brain and quick wits to overcome any danger. So I<br />  think he indeed is a hero.</p>

<p>    Dear Arun<br />    If you are enamoured by Ilaya Pallavan you ll love<br />    Ilanchezhian to bits(Yavana Rani) But there is no<br />    comparison at all because Kalkis heros are lesser<br />    mortals with a quick wit...<br />    Even Arulmozhivarmar is saved by Women Mandhakini<br />    nad then Poonguzhali....thats the greatness of Kalki<br />    just because someone is the centre theme charector<br />    he cant or doesnt do it all...everybody has weakness<br />    and pitfalls</p>
<p>    Vandhiyadevan couldnt swim</p>
<p>    He was valiant and has only lost to superior<br />    warriors Arulmozhi though it is due to surprise and<br />    poonguzhlais distraction...</p>
<p>    He has resisted all tempataions Mannasai Ponnasai<br />    and Porulaasai...</p>
<p>    He was committed in his goals</p>
<p>    its all those which make him a great hero</p>
<p>    secondly its in our mindset that hero always finds<br />    a way out and doesnt need anybody else..its his<br />    quick wit which gets him out of ravidasan<br />    its his valaour which saves him from the arabians<br />    so please dont write him off<br />    Sri<br />    Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@gmail.com <drarunkrishnan%40gmail.com  <br />  wrote:<br />    Venketesh,</drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>    I didn't say he wasn't heroic. But he wasn't<br />    terribly intelligent, the way he was portrayed...<br />    Most of what happened to him was due to pure luck..<br />    and it wasn't because of any superior<br />    wit/wisdom/intelligence that he managed.. That is my<br />    point.</p>

Time and again, he<br />  stumbles across <br />  things and<br />          events more or less catch up to him rather<br />  than his shaping <br />  things. Maybe<br />          Kalki wanted to portray exactly that.. that<br />  he was like a <br />  leaf caught in the<br />          Chola war-of-succession maelstrom but that's<br />  what it looks <br />  like to me.</p>

          Vanthiyathevan is a lucky bumbling idiot..        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Sridhar,</p>
<p>I totally agree with you. Ilaya pallavan and<br />Ilanchezian are larger than life portrayal.</p>
<p>Arun,</p>
<p>If we belive that a hero deinitely has to do<br />everything by himself, then Vandhiyadevan may not be<br />the choice. </p>
<p>He is defnitley lucky but not a bumbling idiot. The<br />way the stoy goes, it gives me a feeling that he uses<br />his brain and quick wits to overcome any danger. So I<br />think he indeed is a hero.</p>
<p>Warm regards,<br />Yuva.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Arun<br />  If you are enamoured by Ilaya Pallavan you ll love<br />  Ilanchezhian to bits(Yavana Rani) But there is no<br />  comparison at all because Kalkis heros are lesser<br />  mortals with a quick wit...<br />  Even Arulmozhivarmar is saved by Women Mandhakini<br />  nad then Poonguzhali....thats the greatness of Kalki<br />  just because someone is the centre theme charector<br />  he cant or doesnt do it all...everybody has weakness<br />  and pitfalls</p>
<p>  Vandhiyadevan couldnt swim</p>
<p>  He was valiant and has only lost to superior<br />  warriors Arulmozhi though it is due to surprise and<br />  poonguzhlais distraction...</p>
<p>  He has resisted all tempataions Mannasai Ponnasai<br />  and Porulaasai...</p>
<p>  He was committed in his goals </p>
<p>  its all those which make him a great hero</p>
<p>  secondly its in our mindset that hero always finds<br />  a way out and doesnt need anybody else..its his<br />  quick wit which gets him out of ravidasan<br />  its his valaour which saves him from the arabians<br />  so please dont write him off<br />  Sri<br />  Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@gmail.com  wrote:<br />  Venketesh,</drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>  I didn't say he wasn't heroic. But he wasn't<br />  terribly intelligent, the way he was portrayed...<br />  Most of what happened to him was due to pure luck..<br />  and it wasn't because of any superior<br />  wit/wisdom/intelligence that he managed.. That is my<br />  point. </p>

          Vanthiyathevan is a lucky bumbling idiot..        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Arun<br />If you are enamoured by Ilaya Pallavan you ll love Ilanchezhian to bits(Yavana Rani) But there is no comparison at all because Kalkis heros are lesser mortals with a quick wit...<br />Even Arulmozhivarmar is saved by Women Mandhakini nad then Poonguzhali....thats the greatness of Kalki just because someone is the centre theme charector he cant or doesnt do it all...everybody has weakness and pitfalls</p>
<p>Vandhiyadevan couldnt swim</p>
<p>He was valiant and has only lost to superior warriors Arulmozhi though it is due to surprise and poonguzhlais distraction...</p>
<p>He has resisted all tempataions Mannasai Ponnasai and Porulaasai...</p>
<p>He was committed in his goals </p>
<p>its all those which make him a great hero</p>
<p>secondly its in our mindset that hero always finds a way out and doesnt need anybody else..its his quick wit which gets him out of ravidasan<br />its his valaour which saves him from the arabians<br />so please dont write him off<br />Sri<br />Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@gmail.com  wrote:<br />Venketesh,</drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>I didn't say he wasn't heroic. But he wasn't terribly intelligent, the way he was portrayed... Most of what happened to him was due to pure luck.. and it wasn't because of any superior wit/wisdom/intelligence that he managed.. That is my point. </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

          Vanthiyathevan is a lucky bumbling idiot..        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>I am not sure about Kadal Pura as I always felt it as a boring book to read.<br />But<br />I finished Three Muskateers. As far as I could see Vanthiyathevan is<br />portraitred as<br />no less heroic than any of them. Yeah he was lucky, but fortune favours the<br />brave.</p>
<p>he was brave enough to take a spear meant for another is one instance enough<br />for his heroism,<br />also, he was a figther and a spy, not a detective to deduce things. really<br />his quick wit and<br />braveness has brought him the fan following.</p>

<p>      Dear All,</p>
<p>      I am sure this will raise some hackles but that never stopped me<br />      before. :) I do believe that Vanthiyathevan, as portrayed by Kalki in PS is<br />      one of the less "heroic" heros that I have read in any book. He is more like<br />      a bumbling fool, albeit a very lucky one. He mostly has others come and bail<br />      him out of difficulties. Time and again, he stumbles across things and<br />      events more or less catch up to him rather than his shaping things. Maybe<br />      Kalki wanted to portray exactly that.. that he was like a leaf caught in the<br />      Chola war-of-succession maelstrom but that's what it looks like to me.</p>
