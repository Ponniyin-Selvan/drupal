</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear all</p>
<p>For my research paper "New perspectives on Nagappattinam" I did quite<br />a thorough investigation on Nagappattinam and choolamanipadma viharam.<br />The paper will be published along with other papers on "Early Indian<br />Influences in South East Asia" Conference by National University of<br />Singapore and National Library board Singapore.</p>
<p>Relying on Pali buddhist text works and other references I was able to<br />establish few things:</p>
<p>- That Nagappattinam did not come into existence in sangam age. It<br />only got developed after the destruction of KavirippomPattinam (called<br />Kaviripattana in Milinda Panho a pali buddhist work)</p>
<p>- That it most probably was developed as a port by Pallavas: A fact<br />not yet recorded by any authors</p>
<p>- That Appar's thevaram is the earliest authentic reference on the<br />port city.</p>
<p>- The earliest of viharas was built by Rajasimha (This was challenged<br />in the conference and further inferences possible only after excavation)</p>
<p>- That Nagappattana did not have many many Buddhist viharas as some<br />portray. By all evidences available there was probably one and only<br />one major vihara complex.</p>
<p>- That most likely, the many pallis referred to by inscriptions were<br />actually located in the same complex</p>
<p>- The exact location of this complex and its boundaries as defined by<br />Kulothunga's smaller leyden grant are available even today (Credits:<br />Dr. Jayakumar)</p>
<p>- On top of all this, I was able to produce a hitherto unknown<br />painting of the entire vihara complex (Not just the popular tower<br />drawing drawn by Sir Walter Scott, but the entire complex). I'll wait<br />for the book to be published - so that this can be publicized.</p>
<p>- That the Choolamanipadma Vihara, (which later on took the name<br />Rajarajap Perumpalli in smaller leyden grant) &amp; other pallis like<br />Rajendrap Perumpalli and Akka salai perumpalli were located possibly<br />within or on nearby areas</p>
<p>What I could not accommodate in the paper is the explanation on 300<br />and odd buddhist bronzes that have been discovered so far in Nagai,<br />the inscriptions on their pedestal, what they actually mean etc. The<br />only scholar who has done work on this bronzes is T.N.Ramachandran.</p>
<p>It is slightly misleading to say "Christians demolished this<br />building". Actually what happened was:</p>
<p>- That the complex was fully in tact in 18th century as proven by the<br />painting</p>
<p>- The tower and the complex had undergone massive destruction between<br />18th and 19th centuries, possibly by Portuguese and dutch who occupied<br />the city</p>
<p>- The tower was in the danger of collapsing</p>
<p>- Jesuist missionaries who wanted to build a school there wrote to<br />british govt, first it was refused and then allowed</p>
<p>- Sir walter scott was the first britisher to feel extensively for<br />this lost pagoda</p>
<p>- St Joseph's college was built in the compound(This later on moved to<br />trichy)</p>
<p>- Presently the district court is functioning here.</p>
<p>Rgds<br />Gokul.S</p>

<p>my estimations may not be accurate. any one sure about the years?</p>

<p>Dear all</p>
<p>i think this is the most extensive work done on choodamani viharam.<br />once the paper is published we could with gokul's permission put it <br />in the arcieves under topic 'PLACES IN PS- THEIR LATER HISTORY/<br />PRESENT STATUS'<br />we should also gather info on the kodi light house, temples mentioned <br />in ps,natural features like veeraanam and rivers.</p>
<p>possible topics could be</p>
<p>MONUMENTS<br />LAKES AND RIVERS<br />TEMPLES<br />PALACES<br />BATTLEFIELDS<br />PORTS</p>
<p>this collection would be of great interest and use to researchers.</p>
<p>regards<br />venketesh</p></abhivencat@yahoo.com></p>
<blockquote><p>  For my research paper "New perspectives on Nagappattinam" I did <br />quite<br />  a thorough investigation on Nagappattinam and choolamanipadma <br />viharam.<br />  The paper will be published along with other papers on "Early Indian<br />  Influences in South East Asia" Conference by National University of<br />  Singapore and National Library board Singapore.</p>
<p>  Relying on Pali buddhist text works and other references I was able <br />to<br />  establish few things:</p>
<p>  - That Nagappattinam did not come into existence in sangam age. It<br />  only got developed after the destruction of KavirippomPattinam <br />(called<br />  Kaviripattana in Milinda Panho a pali buddhist work)</p>
<p>  - That it most probably was developed as a port by Pallavas: A fact<br />  not yet recorded by any authors</p>
<p>  - That Appar's thevaram is the earliest authentic reference on the<br />  port city.</p>
<p>  - The earliest of viharas was built by Rajasimha (This was <br />challenged<br />  in the conference and further inferences possible only after <br />excavation)</p>
<p>  - That Nagappattana did not have many many Buddhist viharas as some<br />  portray. By all evidences available there was probably one and only<br />  one major vihara complex.</p>
<p>  - That most likely, the many pallis referred to by inscriptions were<br />  actually located in the same complex</p>
<p>  - The exact location of this complex and its boundaries as defined <br />by<br />  Kulothunga's smaller leyden grant are available even today (Credits:<br />  Dr. Jayakumar)</p>
<p>  - On top of all this, I was able to produce a hitherto unknown<br />  painting of the entire vihara complex (Not just the popular tower<br />  drawing drawn by Sir Walter Scott, but the entire complex). I'll <br />wait<br />  for the book to be published - so that this can be publicized.</p>
<p>  - That the Choolamanipadma Vihara, (which later on took the name<br />  Rajarajap Perumpalli in smaller leyden grant) &amp; other pallis like<br />  Rajendrap Perumpalli and Akka salai perumpalli were located possibly<br />  within or on nearby areas</p>
<p>  What I could not accommodate in the paper is the explanation on 300<br />  and odd buddhist bronzes that have been discovered so far in Nagai,<br />  the inscriptions on their pedestal, what they actually mean etc. The<br />  only scholar who has done work on this bronzes is T.N.Ramachandran.</p>
<p>  It is slightly misleading to say "Christians demolished this<br />  building". Actually what happened was:</p>
<p>  - That the complex was fully in tact in 18th century as proven by <br />the<br />  painting</p>
<p>  - The tower and the complex had undergone massive destruction <br />between<br />  18th and 19th centuries, possibly by Portuguese and dutch who <br />occupied<br />  the city</p>
<p>  - The tower was in the danger of collapsing</p>
<p>  - Jesuist missionaries who wanted to build a school there wrote to<br />  british govt, first it was refused and then allowed</p>
<p>  - Sir walter scott was the first britisher to feel extensively for<br />  this lost pagoda</p>
<p>  - St Joseph's college was built in the compound(This later on moved <br />to<br />  trichy)</p>
<p>  - Presently the district court is functioning here.</p>

<p>  mr.gokul,<br />  does the st.joseph's school archives in trichy has any documents<br />  regarding this. my freinds who studied there were delighted to know<br />  this fact. usually mission schools have their documents preserved.</p>
<p>  i think nagai was the capital of british tanjore for sometime before<br />  moving to tranquebar. tranquebar was bought somewhere in 1760 by<br />  british. they moved to tanjore town only in 1805.</p>
<p>  my estimations may not be accurate. any one sure about the years?</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you. I'll let you know once the work is published.<br />There has been some delay.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if St Joseph's college has the papers. All these events<br />are already on record and the first paper Sir walter scott wrote on<br />the Black pagoda (as it was called in 19th century) exhaustively<br />covers the subject.</p>
<p>One more thing:<br />- The official of Sri Vijaya King was PERMANENTLY stationed in Chola<br />country. Some sort of an embassy should have functioned. I'm sure a<br />similar chola embassy should have existed.</p>
<p>This official had presented an ardhanari statue in Kayarohanaswami<br />temple. This ardhanari exists even today ! Once again, this was bought<br />to light during the field work.</p>

<p>there was nothing like a seperate tanjore capital. tanjore was just <br />annexed into madras presidency</p>
<p>as far as tranqubar was concerned heres its dtails from wiki</p>
<p>it was founded by the Danish East India Company in 1620 when the main <br />fort in Trankebar city, known as Fort Dansborg, was built by a Danish <br />captain named Ove Gjedde as the residence of the governor and other <br />officials for about 150 years. It is now a museum hosting a <br />collection of artefacts from the time of Danish presence in the <br />region. A Danish factory (commercial settlement) was opened here as <br />early as 1620.</p>
<p>Tranquebar was controlled by the British in 1801 due to the <br />Napoleonic Wars in Europe, and restored to Denmark following the Kiel <br />Peace in 1814. It was sold, along with the other Danish settlements <br />in India, Serampore and the Nicobars, to Great Britain in 1845.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Gokul - I reached ISEAS for accessing the conference archives but was informed that there will be a book published soon, do you know the publication dates. </p>
<p>thanks <br />Sakthis Kumar  </p>
<p>From: Gokul.S <br />Sent: Saturday, February 21, 2009 6:39 AM<br />To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a> <br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Choolamanipadma Vihara of Nagapattinam</p>
<p>Dear all</p>
<p>For my research paper "New perspectives on Nagappattinam" I did quite<br />a thorough investigation on Nagappattinam and choolamanipadma viharam.<br />The paper will be published along with other papers on "Early Indian<br />Influences in South East Asia" Conference by National University of<br />Singapore and National Library board Singapore.</p>
<p>Relying on Pali buddhist text works and other references I was able to<br />establish few things:</p>
<p>- That Nagappattinam did not come into existence in sangam age. It<br />only got developed after the destruction of KavirippomPattinam (called<br />Kaviripattana in Milinda Panho a pali buddhist work)</p>
<p>- That it most probably was developed as a port by Pallavas: A fact<br />not yet recorded by any authors</p>
<p>- That Appar's thevaram is the earliest authentic reference on the<br />port city.</p>
<p>- The earliest of viharas was built by Rajasimha (This was challenged<br />in the conference and further inferences possible only after excavation)</p>
<p>- That Nagappattana did not have many many Buddhist viharas as some<br />portray. By all evidences available there was probably one and only<br />one major vihara complex.</p>
<p>- That most likely, the many pallis referred to by inscriptions were<br />actually located in the same complex</p>
<p>- The exact location of this complex and its boundaries as defined by<br />Kulothunga's smaller leyden grant are available even today (Credits:<br />Dr. Jayakumar)</p>
<p>- On top of all this, I was able to produce a hitherto unknown<br />painting of the entire vihara complex (Not just the popular tower<br />drawing drawn by Sir Walter Scott, but the entire complex). I'll wait<br />for the book to be published - so that this can be publicized.</p>
<p>- That the Choolamanipadma Vihara, (which later on took the name<br />Rajarajap Perumpalli in smaller leyden grant) &amp; other pallis like<br />Rajendrap Perumpalli and Akka salai perumpalli were located possibly<br />within or on nearby areas</p>
<p>What I could not accommodate in the paper is the explanation on 300<br />and odd buddhist bronzes that have been discovered so far in Nagai,<br />the inscriptions on their pedestal, what they actually mean etc. The<br />only scholar who has done work on this bronzes is T.N.Ramachandran.</p>
<p>It is slightly misleading to say "Christians demolished this<br />building". Actually what happened was:</p>
<p>- That the complex was fully in tact in 18th century as proven by the<br />painting</p>
<p>- The tower and the complex had undergone massive destruction between<br />18th and 19th centuries, possibly by Portuguese and dutch who occupied<br />the city</p>
<p>- The tower was in the danger of collapsing</p>
<p>- Jesuist missionaries who wanted to build a school there wrote to<br />british govt, first it was refused and then allowed</p>
<p>- Sir walter scott was the first britisher to feel extensively for<br />this lost pagoda</p>
<p>- St Joseph's college was built in the compound(This later on moved to<br />trichy)</p>
<p>- Presently the district court is functioning here.</p>

<p>We should add one more to that topic. Ships or Types of ships. Im keen on<br />knowing the various forms of cargo and war ships used during this time. Im<br />sure there must have been truly wonderful innovations in that field during<br />that time.</p>

<p>  regards<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    For my research paper "New perspectives on Nagappattinam" I did<br />  quite<br />    a thorough investigation on Nagappattinam and choolamanipadma<br />  viharam.<br />    The paper will be published along with other papers on "Early Indian<br />    Influences in South East Asia" Conference by National University of<br />    Singapore and National Library board Singapore.</p>
<p>    Relying on Pali buddhist text works and other references I was able<br />  to<br />    establish few things:</p>
<p>    - That Nagappattinam did not come into existence in sangam age. It<br />    only got developed after the destruction of KavirippomPattinam<br />  (called<br />    Kaviripattana in Milinda Panho a pali buddhist work)</p>

<p>    - That Nagappattana did not have many many Buddhist viharas as some<br />    portray. By all evidences available there was probably one and only<br />    one major vihara complex.</p>
<p>    - That most likely, the many pallis referred to by inscriptions were<br />    actually located in the same complex</p>
<p>    - The exact location of this complex and its boundaries as defined<br />  by<br />    Kulothunga's smaller leyden grant are available even today (Credits:<br />    Dr. Jayakumar)</p>
<p>    - On top of all this, I was able to produce a hitherto unknown<br />    painting of the entire vihara complex (Not just the popular tower<br />    drawing drawn by Sir Walter Scott, but the entire complex). I'll<br />  wait<br />    for the book to be published - so that this can be publicized.</p>
<p>    - That the Choolamanipadma Vihara, (which later on took the name<br />    Rajarajap Perumpalli in smaller leyden grant) &amp; other pallis like<br />    Rajendrap Perumpalli and Akka salai perumpalli were located possibly<br />    within or on nearby areas</p>
<p>    What I could not accommodate in the paper is the explanation on 300<br />    and odd buddhist bronzes that have been discovered so far in Nagai,<br />    the inscriptions on their pedestal, what they actually mean etc. The<br />    only scholar who has done work on this bronzes is T.N.Ramachandran.</p>
<p>    It is slightly misleading to say "Christians demolished this<br />    building". Actually what happened was:</p>
<p>    - That the complex was fully in tact in 18th century as proven by<br />  the<br />    painting</p>
<p>    - The tower and the complex had undergone massive destruction<br />  between<br />    18th and 19th centuries, possibly by Portuguese and dutch who<br />  occupied<br />    the city</p>

<p>  - That the complex was fully in tact in 18th century as proven by <br />the<br />  painting</p>
<p>  - The tower and the complex had undergone massive destruction <br />between<br />  18th and 19th centuries, possibly by Portuguese and dutch who <br />occupied<br />  the city</p>
<p>  - The tower was in the danger of collapsing</p>
<p>  - Jesuist missionaries who wanted to build a school there wrote to<br />  british govt, first it was refused and then allowed</p>
<p>  - Sir walter scott was the first britisher to feel extensively for<br />  this lost pagoda</p>
<p>  - St Joseph's college was built in the compound(This later on moved <br />to<br />  trichy)</p>
<p>  - Presently the district court is functioning here.</p>
