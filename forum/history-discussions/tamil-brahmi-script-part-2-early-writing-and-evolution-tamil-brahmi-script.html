</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear All,<br />In the second part of our series, we are examining how writing came into about in Tamilnadu from Rock Art to&nbsp;graffiti and evolution of Tamil Brahmi script. We&nbsp; also touch upon the Indus Script and its spread into Chalcolothic or pre-Iron age Tamilnadu. We review few controversial theories on the origins of the Brahmi script and evolution of the Tamil Brahmi itself. We finally see artifacts with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions in distant landssuch as Egypt and Thailand.<br />But before that, I'm taking you all for a small peek into the pre-history of the ancient Indians of Tamilnadu.<br />Happy reading and questions welcome!<br />Best regards,<br />-vk-<br />&nbsp; Human Prehistory<br />If we were to ask, a geologist would say that we are living in the Quaternary period of the Cenozoic era. This period started at the trail of the Pliocene epoch. The Pliocene epoch gave way to the Pleistocene epoch. It is theHolocene epoch, we are currently living. Some scientists are suggesting anAnthropocene epoch beginning at the 19th Century AD to mark the period in which the human activity began to make significant impact on the climate and eco-system.<br />The Pleistocene epoch is characterized by the Paleolithic people that livedfrom 2.5 million years ago until 10,000 years ago. The Paleolithic people made handmade tools and sharpened stone. They were mainly hunter-gatherer societies that lived in caves or huts by the side of water bodies. The Paleolithic people also buried their ancestors.&nbsp; After the Paleolithic culture, the Mesolithic culture came about in some parts of the world and lasted between 11000BC to 5000BC. This period was characterized by the usage of bows, spears, canoes, fishing etc., and the people lived in more sedentary environments. The &nbsp;Neolithic culture began about 8500 BC in south Asiaand ended by about 5500BC. The Neolithic cultures are characterized by their ability to farming, domesticating wild animals, usage of wheels and pottery.&nbsp; These three ages are known as the Stone Age.<br />The Neolithic culture gave way to Chalcolithic age by about 4500 BC, BronzeAge by 3500 BC and then Iron Age by 1500BC. The Iron Age lasted until 200BC to 200AD in different parts of the civilized world. <br />&nbsp;Pre Historic Tamilnadu<br />There is archeological evidence for the inhabitance of Paleolithic people in several areas of Tamilnadu. &nbsp;Several Paleolithic sites such as Attirambakkam, Parikkulam are studied so far. The Parikkulam site ( near Poondi reservoir ) &nbsp;is often known as the ?Madras Industry? of the early Paleolithic area: <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/2006/05/13/stories/2006051322590300.htm" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/2006/05/13/stories/2006051322590300.htm">http://www.hinduonnet.com/2006/05/13/stories/2006051322590300.htm</a><br />In December 2006, our Temple Cleaners group made a visit to the Gudiyam Paleolithic site near the Poondi reservoir and their blogs can be read at:<br />&nbsp;http://reachhistory.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_archive.html<br /><a href="http://www.geocities.com/uma_parasuraman/Gudiyam_Caves/index.html" title="http://www.geocities.com/uma_parasuraman/Gudiyam_Caves/index.html">http://www.geocities.com/uma_parasuraman/Gudiyam_Caves/index.html</a><br />Contacts with the outside world, migrations and natural evolution caused the Paleolithic civilization to advance to Neolithic stage in various parts of Tamilnadu. <br />S.R. Rao excavated a C. 2000 BC Neolithic site at Paiyampalli. According tohim it was a pure Neolithic culture not influenced by Central Indian Chalcolithic cultures. <br />Excavations at Korkai, Adichchanallur, Madurai, Uraiyur, Kodumanal, Karur, Tirukkampuliyur, Alagari, Alagankulam, Nallampatti (Coimbatore) reveal a culture that was in transition from the Chalcolithic to the Pre-Iron age. These sites are dated to about 1800BC to the last quarter of the 2nd Millennium BC. <br />Post this continuity of the earlier Neolithic-Chalcolithic-Bronze Age cultures into the Iron Age is established by lower Kaveri Valley excavations anddated to the 8th Century BC.&nbsp; Dr. S. Gurumurthy suggests that the Iron Age started in Tamilnadu around 1200BC and continued until 3rd Century AD, in line with the North Indian Iron Age. The beginning of Iron Age could be pushed further to 1800BC with further excavations and findings at Adichchannallur. This dating of the Iron Age in Tamilnadu aligns well with that ofthe Cankam age.<br />&nbsp; Evolution of writing in Tamilnadu<br />Probably writing came into being when the Neolithic Indians started to paint on rocks and caves.&nbsp; Scholars record about 100 sites in Tamilnadu with ancient rock art. White Kaolin and Red Ochre were used to paint picturesthat conveyed their daily life, environment or religious beliefs.&nbsp; Read the following articles that capture the rock art recorded at Karikkiyur and Mavadaippu in recent times.<br /><a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/stories/20070629000206400.htm" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/stories/20070629000206400.htm">http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/stories/20070629000206400.htm</a><br /><a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2004/03/07/stories/2004030700460800.htm" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2004/03/07/stories/2004030700460800.htm">http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2004/03/07/stories/20040307004608...</a><br />These include a war scene, an X-RAY bull!, a neat portrait of grazing bisons. A group of dancers probably celebrates a meal after a hunt. The portraitof a Centaur and human sacrifice indicate the presence of an early religion.<br />Often the rock art is accompanied by graffiti, symbols that resemble Indus signs and some even pre-Brahmi signs. The Keelvalai and Perumukkal rock artare classic examples of this proto writing.<br />When the civilization advanced, pottery came into being and this became a medium of writing. Early Neolithic pottery contains scratches or incisions or painted marks/motifs used as decorations. <br />Dr. S. Gurumurthy observes that the graffiti of the Chalcolithic culture ofTamilnadu was probably indigeneous of origin that evolved from the traditional age old painted marks and motifs on the vessels. He suggests that the practice of scratching graffiti gained momentum due to transmission of ideas or symbols from the pre-Harappan to the Chalcolithic people.&nbsp; He maintains that few Indus scripts were used by Chalcolithic potters for inclusion in the tradition, where as the Harappans themselves were not very enthusiastic about the tradition of graffiti.<br />Furthermore, he examined about 800 ligatured graffiti and of them 50 were from Tamilnadu. They were purely built on Indus signs and therefore may constitute the Indus script. This is further corroborated with the recent findings of the Sembiankandiyur polished stone axe with Indus script , the Sulurdish in London Museum and the pottery with double arrow signs at Sembiankandiyur.<br /><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/27/stories/2008042757322000.htm" title="http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/27/stories/2008042757322000.htm">http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/27/stories/2008042757322000.htm</a><br /><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/01/stories/2006050101992000.htm" title="http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/01/stories/2006050101992000.htm">http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/01/stories/2006050101992000.htm</a><br />These give a fair evidence of the far spread of the Indus script in Tamilnadu. This could have been due to human migration or due to contacts. During the mid Iron Age, it seems the usage of the Indus script became obsolete with the evolution of the Brahmi script. The Graffiti and Indus signs continued to make its way into the punch marked coins until the Brahmi script replaced it during the Asokan era in the 3rd century BC.<br />Therefore, the evolution of early writing in Tamilnadu can be characterizedas follows:<br />Rock Art---&gt;Graffiti---&gt;[+ Indus Signs]---&gt; Brahmi Script<br />&nbsp; Bilingual Seal?<br />At Anaikottai, Sri Lanka, a bilingual seal was supposedly unearthed in 1980.&nbsp; This mysterious seal is reported to contain 3 Indus signs at the top row and 3 Tamil Brahmi letters at the bottom row and reported to be the ?Rosetta stone? of the Indus Script. &nbsp;Dr. R. Mathivanan reads the Brahmi letters as ?ti-vu-ko? ( i.e., king of the island ) and goes on deciphering the Indus script based on this reading. But the scribing of the seal ( especially the letter ?ti? ) is given differently in&nbsp; Dr. R. Mathivanan?s book and Dr. S. Gurumurthy?s book / Iravatham Mahadevan?s book.&nbsp; Iravatham Mahadevan maintains that the results are inconclusive. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Evolution of the Brahmi Script<br />Dr. S. Gurumurthy observes few Brahmi letter like graffiti on the Chalcolithic pottery which could have influenced the formation of certain Brahmi letters. He suggests that certain Brahmi letters such as Ka,Ta, Ma, Ya could have evolved from Chalcolothic graffiti.<br />Dr. Gift Siromoney suggests that the Brahmi script was invented by a singleindividual. He claims that the inventor of the script devised it from two basic geometric patterns. He summarily rejects that the Brahmi script evolved from the Indus script or from other non-Indian scripts<br /><a href="http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Epigraphy/epig_invention.htm" title="http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Epigraphy/epig_invention.htm">http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Epigraphy/epig_invention.htm</a><br />Dr. Iravatham Mahadevan believes that the Indus Script and Brahmi script were not interrelated.&nbsp; The reason in, the Indus script is pictorial andBrahmi script is based on alphabets.<br />Some scholars suggested evolution of Brahmi script from the Phenician alphabets. Dr. Clyde Winters doesn?t believe that the Brahmi script was based on Phoenician alphabets. His comparison of the Vowels of both the scripts is totally failing.<br />&nbsp;Evolution of the Tamil Brahmi script *<br />Iravatham Mahadevan is conclusive about the origin of the Tamil Brahmi script from the Brahmi script ( which is defined as the earliest known stage ofthe script from which all other native Indian scripts ( excepting Harappan)&nbsp; derived. ) as follows:<br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All but 4 of the 26 letters in Tamil-Brahmi are identical or nearly so with the corresponding letters of Brahmiand have the same phonetic values.<br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the additional letters in Tamil-Brahmi viz. l, ?, r and n are adapted from letters with the nearest phonetic values in Brahmi.<br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alphabetical order of letters common to both the scripts is identical.<br />d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is revealing that Tolkappiyam places &nbsp;r, &nbsp;n , &nbsp;l and &nbsp;? at the end of the series of stops, nasals and liquids ( Tol Elu 19-21 ). This arrangement deviates from the order based on articulatory phonetics. This small but significant detail indicates that the four special letters were originally regarded as additions tothe alphabet taken over from Brahmi. The additional letter n &nbsp;is alsodescribed as the last in the Tamil alphabet.<br />He maintains that the Tamil-Brahmi is formed by adapting Brahmi to the requirements of the Tamil phonetic system in the following manner:<br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Omission of letters for sounds not present in Tamil.<br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Addition of letters to represent sounds inTamil which were not in Brahmi Viz: l, ?, r and n.<br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modification of letters by employment of special diactitic mark viz the pulli, to:<br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depict basic consonants in final position<br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid ligaturing of consonant clusters<br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distinguish short vowels e and o from the respective long vowels.<br />&nbsp;* - Points reproduced from Dr. Iravatham Mahadevan for a brief review.

<p>    Excellant detailed work. Just to make it clear - you are talking <br />of <br />    development of the script - we would also like to have similar <br />on <br />    language...meaning is you could also explain the diff between <br />  script <br />    and language....sanskrit, prakrit, tamil - etc. the languages as <br />we <br />    see today, when did they evolve - was their evolution parallely <br />    occuring with the evolution of the script. In laymans terms - we <br />    cannot read the tamil inscriptions of RRC - when using todays <br />tamil <br />    script, but when someone reads it out for us we can understand, <br />as <br />    the words aka language is the same</p>
<p>    rgds<br />    vj</p>
<p>  Dear VJ,</p>
<p>  In the coming weeks, we shall see a large scale difference in the <br />  inscribed texts and the Cankam poetry. The inscriptions are highly <br />  colloquial wheras the Cankam poetry itself is scholarly. We will <br />  examine comments of scholars on this!</p>
<p>  I can touch upon evolution of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Tamil itself. <br />But <br />  the subject itself is so controversial and might trigger emotional <br />  arguments within the group. So is the dating and scholarly <br />  observations on the Neolithic-Chalcolithic Bronze Age-Iron Age <br />  Tamilnadu. I have avoided all contoversies and tried to put across <br />  the dates/information which makes common sense based on recent <br />  findings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hi, i just wanted readers to know that the language ( spoken) doesnt <br />necessarily hv to be linked to the script ( written)....so the dates <br />mentioned are to the evolution of script and not the tamil <br />language....in line with our Kal thonri.....mootha kudi</p></vkasirajan@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  Over the next few weeks, readers of this series will be able to <br />read <br />  Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on their own! It can be extended to <br />other <br />  scripts as well. This is something we wanted to do for our group.</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>that would be great...next time any of us go into temples, we would <br />focus more on the walls than the god. looking forward to it</p>
<p>Its always a pleasure to mine into the depths of our history to come <br />up with something that baffles us:</p>
<p>Two questions</p>
<p>One - </p>
<p>Tamil names for fractions</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5180/numeral.html" title="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5180/numeral.html">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5180/numeral.html</a></p>
<p>the last one -athisaaram - 1 divided by 1838,400 stumped me.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Tamil lexicon :</p>
<p>This was posted by a friend in another forum - the tamil words which <br />denote hair....this shows the extent to which the language was <br />evolved - to go into such detailed differences and how they knew all <br />these and input into verse....</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to avoid getting into copyright issues with images...So I <br />have confined the series with external links to enable people to see <br />them atleast.<br />But in the coming weeks, I will reproduce inscriptions myself, scan and <br />post it. There are no external links and news paper articles on these!</p>

<blockquote><p>  dear Vk,</p>
<p>  Excellant detailed work. Just to make it clear - you are talking of <br />  development of the script - we would also like to have similar on <br />  language...meaning is you could also explain the diff between <br />script <br />  and language....sanskrit, prakrit, tamil - etc. the languages as we <br />  see today, when did they evolve - was their evolution parallely <br />  occuring with the evolution of the script. In laymans terms - we <br />  cannot read the tamil inscriptions of RRC - when using todays tamil <br />  script, but when someone reads it out for us we can understand, as <br />  the words aka language is the same</p>
<p>  rgds<br />  vj</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Dear VJ,</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we shall see a large scale difference in the <br />inscribed texts and the Cankam poetry. The inscriptions are highly <br />colloquial wheras the Cankam poetry itself is scholarly. We will <br />examine comments of scholars on this!</p>
<p>I can touch upon evolution of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Tamil itself. But <br />the subject itself is so controversial and might trigger emotional <br />arguments within the group. So is the dating and scholarly <br />observations on the Neolithic-Chalcolithic Bronze Age-Iron Age <br />Tamilnadu. I have avoided all contoversies and tried to put across <br />the dates/information which makes common sense based on recent <br />findings.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, readers of this series will be able to read <br />Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on their own! It can be extended to other <br />scripts as well. This is something we wanted to do for our group.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
