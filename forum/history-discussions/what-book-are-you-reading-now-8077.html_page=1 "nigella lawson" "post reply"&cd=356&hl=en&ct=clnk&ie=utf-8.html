        <p>Hi Venket</p>
<p>It has to be Nandhini scene or manimekalai scene .... 1. Where <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  rescues them (nandhini and manimekalai ) from the lake after the cheetah chase ?</p>
<p>2. When <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  meets nandhini for the first time at PPV's palace and just before manthravadi comes in ?</p>
<p>3. When parthibendran trips off seeing nandhini in the camp at kodikkarai???</p>
<p>Few instances that I cud think off that the author has avoid any boundless-imagination.. (Why dig sandilyan and compare him hence suggest Boundless-imagination to be used.. Sandilyan bookayum kasu koduthu vangi pandichu magiltheengalla sir ?)</p>
<p>But ur quiz is usually tough - now that I have experienced when we framed it during the PSPV festival I will wait for other thinking souls to jump in :))</p>

        <p>I didn't much like the Naughtiest Girl thing - it seemed so much<br />a Treatise on How Girls Must Behave tripe that I gave up after half a book.<br />:) Blyton seemed better when she forgot to be all moralistic and<br />goody-goody. I did go on a Nancy Drew and Hardy Boy kick after that - but I<br />never did get into Mills and Boon. Dunno why.<br />The cookbooks seem a great read. Must try them. Speaking of cooking - anyone<br />watch Nigella Lawson's shows? :)))))</p>

<p>      ? <br />      Pavithra, yes i agree 100% on Blyton.</p>
<p>      If you like food descriptions i highly recommend this lady named Bharti Kirschner who is also a culinary writer. Her novels Pastries andd Darjeeling are packed with food descriptions in the most luscious manner possible. Especially pastries is about a lady running a bakery somewhere in seattle. After i finished that book i had such a long craving for cakes and put onquite some weight :))</p>

<p>These are all one time reads and advantage in US is you get them in libraries. I would not spend the money they cost otherwise. Raghavan Iyer's Turmeric trail is a good read and rings true for many south indians. Has anyone read it?</p>

<p>  ? <br />  TMS - 'cook and see' is a horrible translation :) I love meenakshi ammal's book too the tamil one that is - brings back lot of memories for me. For anyone who likes cook books with life stories there are two more - TurmericTrail by Raghavan Iyer and Recipes and Stories from Grand Trunk Road, forget authors, couple of americans on tour in India. </p>

<p>    ? <br />    Pavithra, yes i agree 100% on Blyton.</p>
<p>    If you like food descriptions i highly recommend this lady named BhartiKirschner who is also a culinary writer. Her novels Pastries andd Darjeeling are packed with food descriptions in the most luscious manner possible. Especially pastries is about a lady running a bakery somewhere in seattle. After i finished that book i had such a long craving for cakes and put on quite some weight :))</p>

<p>   herge a nazi?</p>
<p>   from the wiki</p>
<p>   During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of being a<br />   collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir), and he was<br />   briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He claimed that he was<br />   simply doing a job under the occupation, like a plumber or carpenter.<br />   After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself believed<br />   that the future of the West could depend on the New Order. For many,<br />   democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order brought new hope.<br />   In light of everything which has happened, it is of course a huge error to<br />   have believed for an instant in the New Order"[23]. The Tintin characterwas<br />   never depicted as adhering to these beliefs. However, it has been argued<br />   that anti-Semitic themes continued, especially in the post-war Flight<br />   714.[24]</p>

<p>              It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans'<br />              club of<br />              kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read<br />              tintin<br />              comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters-<br />              both invite<br />              trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read<br />              other books<br />              to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy<br />              English series too.<br />              I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but<br />              managed to get<br />              5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and<br />              have them in my<br />              Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set<br />              of tintin<br />              books :))</p>
<p>              Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite<br />              fantacised by<br />              it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>              Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a<br />              character I loved<br />              to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too<br />              trivial - may be<br />              I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>              Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>              Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might<br />              think so but<br />              overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the<br />              world and is<br />              considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to<br />              win the<br />              World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs,<br />              hotels and<br />              memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>              I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other<br />              Tintin fans are<br />              there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine<br />              is the<br />              Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                 Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no<br />                 different from<br />                 attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better<br />                 you have to<br />                 read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost<br />                 all the<br />                 children from other countries France, America, Africa and so<br />                 on are<br />                 caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British<br />                 stereotypes. Of<br />                 course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one<br />                 adventure<br />                 book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma.<br />                 That is as<br />                 far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have<br />                 any careers,<br />                 all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and<br />                 mothers and<br />                 boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course<br />                 all that is<br />                 British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                 The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references<br />                 about a few<br />                 years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of<br />                 the States,<br />                 France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history<br />                 we did not<br />                 find it objectionable but most people from other countries<br />                 do.</p>
<p>                 Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of<br />                 originality, short<br />                 sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point<br />                 also is that<br />                 she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories<br />                 children love so<br />                 very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhoodi<br />                 browse now<br />                 and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring.<br />                 There was a<br />                 time when I thought these were classics but that is no<br />                 longer there.</p>

<p>                   my favourite was the one in which the lands change<br />                   everyday above a<br />                   magic tree<br />                   one land was the land of rhymes where you had to answer to<br />                   every query<br />                   with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>                   famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin<br />                   being<br />                   kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems<br />                   funny now.<br />                   if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that<br />                   age.<br />                   fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was<br />                   called<br />                   fatty.<br />                   does he come in secret seven?</p>

        <p>TMS - 'cook and see' is a horrible translation :) I love meenakshi ammal's book too the tamil one that is - brings back lot of memories for me. For anyone who likes cook books with life stories there are two more - Turmeric Trail by Raghavan Iyer and Recipes and Stories from Grand Trunk Road, forgetauthors, couple of americans on tour in India. </p>

<p>  I unabashedly would confess that the best culinary book in Tamil I enjoy reading from my mom's collection is 'Samaithu Paar' published eons ago by Meenakshi Ammal. There are literally hundreds of old style South Indian goodies in the book I keep checking up just to get the kick in spite of the challenging uzhakku, aazhakku phrases that would trip you off.?

<p>  ? <br />  Pavithra, yes i agree 100% on Blyton.</p>
<p>  If you like food descriptions i highly recommend this lady named Bharti Kirschner who is also a culinary writer. Her novels Pastries andd Darjeelingare packed with food descriptions in the most luscious manner possible. Especially pastries is about a lady running a bakery somewhere in seattle. After i finished that book i had such a long craving for cakes and put on quite some weight :))</p>

<p>    Maloo - probably one of the Famous Five series. I liked them, but lost<br />    interest in that after a while. Fatty still remains my favourite. Like you<br />    said, she opened up avenues as far as imagination went. I learnt to explore<br />    strange new worlds through her. I might not agree with everything she wrote,<br />    but it was a different world, and I liked that experience.</p>
<p>    Re the food: yup, I enjoy descriptions of food, even if they're meat-based<br />    (and I'm a confirmed veggie) - maybe its just the way she used her words<br />    that did it. :) For that matter, I go after foodie-descriptions wherever I<br />    find them. All those foodie examples in PS, for instance (ohhh, that<br />    varagarisi choru ...)<br />    Balakumaran' s inserted a lot of foodie-stuff in his Udayar - it feels like<br />    its been thrust in, but I still like them.</p>
<p>    There's another example of wonderfully foodie descriptions in one of Stella<br />    Bruce's novels - Panangattu Annachi. Its so full of food stuff that the<br />    instinct to burp after a particularly gourmet (!) experience is<br />    overwhelming</p>

<p>  herge a nazi?</p>
<p>  from the wiki</p>
<p>  During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of being a collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir), and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation, like a plumber or carpenter.<br />  After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself believed that the future of the West could depend on the New Order. For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order brought new hope. In light of everything which has happened, it is of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New Order"[23]. The Tintin character was never depicted as adhering to these beliefs. However, it has been argued that anti-Semitic themes continued, especially in the post-war Flight 714.[24]</p>

<p>        Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>             It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />             kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to readtintin<br />             comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />             trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to readother books<br />             to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series too.<br />             I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />             5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in my<br />             Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />             books :))</p>
<p>             Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />             it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>             Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />             to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />             I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>             Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />             overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />             considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />             World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />             memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>             I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are<br />             there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />             Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />                attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it betteryou have to<br />                read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almostall the<br />                children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />                caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />                course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />                book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma.That is as<br />                far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls haveany careers,<br />                all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives andmothers and<br />                boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />                British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />                years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />                France and Germany too - but given our own colonial historywe did not<br />                find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>                Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />                sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The pointalso is that<br />                she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />                very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />                and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />                time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>  herge a nazi?</p>
<p>  from the wiki</p>
<p>  During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of being a collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir), and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation, like a plumber or carpenter.<br />  After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself believed that the future of the West could depend on the New Order. For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order brought new hope. In light of everything which has happened, it is of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New Order"[23]. The Tintin character was never depicted as adhering to these beliefs. However, it has been argued that anti-Semitic themes continued, especially in the post-war Flight 714.[24]</p>

<p>    Wow, didn't know that..who thought Herge was Nazi, the French?</p>
<p>    My favorite is Thomson and Thompson too..the scene where they grow green beards and hiccup..priceless. .and the scene where Captain Haddock circles the moon (The moon has a new satelli named HAddock :)) Wow and Professor Calculus 'acting the goat'..I will never forget how i lent one copy of Tintin to my retired uncle - over 70 and never read much...he read one and was laughing so loud till the house was echoeing and the older women were clueless what was going on..Humor unites people in odd ways :))</p>

<p>        Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to readtintin<br />             comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />             trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to readother books<br />             to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series too.<br />             I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />             5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in my<br />             Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />             books :))</p>
<p>             Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />             it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>             Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />             to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />             I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>             Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />             overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />             considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />             World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />             memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>             I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are<br />             there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />             Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />                attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it betteryou have to<br />                read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almostall the<br />                children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />                caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />                course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />                book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma.That is as<br />                far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls haveany careers,<br />                all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives andmothers and<br />                boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />                British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />                years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />                France and Germany too - but given our own colonial historywe did not<br />                find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>                Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />                sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The pointalso is that<br />                she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />                very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />                and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />                time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

        <p>Ladies,</p>
<p>I unabashedly would confess that the best culinary book in Tamil I enjoy reading from my mom's collection is 'Samaithu Paar' published eons ago by Meenakshi Ammal. There are literally hundreds of old style South Indian goodies in the book I keep checking up just to get the kick in spite of the challenging uzhakku, aazhakku phrases that would trip you off.? There is an English?translation available?' Cook and See' - but no recipes for pastries though !</p>

<p>? <br />Pavithra, yes i agree 100% on Blyton.</p>
<p>If you like food descriptions i highly recommend this lady named Bharti Kirschner who is also a culinary writer. Her novels Pastries andd Darjeeling are packed with food descriptions in the most luscious manner possible. Especially pastries is about a lady running a bakery somewhere in seattle. After i finished that book i had such a long craving for cakes and put on quitesome weight :))</p>

<p>  Re the food: yup, I enjoy descriptions of food, even if they're meat-based<br />  (and I'm a confirmed veggie) - maybe its just the way she used her words<br />  that did it. :) For that matter, I go after foodie-descriptions wherever I<br />  find them. All those foodie examples in PS, for instance (ohhh, that<br />  varagarisi choru ...)<br />  Balakumaran' s inserted a lot of foodie-stuff in his Udayar - it feels like<br />  its been thrust in, but I still like them.</p>
<p>  There's another example of wonderfully foodie descriptions in one of Stella<br />  Bruce's novels - Panangattu Annachi. Its so full of food stuff that the<br />  instinct to burp after a particularly gourmet (!) experience is<br />  overwhelming</p>

<p>herge a nazi?</p>
<p>from the wiki</p>
<p>During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of being a collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir), and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation, like a plumber or carpenter.<br />After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself believed that the future of the West could depend on the New Order. For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order brought new hope. In lightof everything which has happened, it is of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New Order"[23]. The Tintin character was never depicted as adhering to these beliefs. However, it has been argued that anti-Semitic themes continued, especially in the post-war Flight 714.[24]</p>

<p>      Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>           It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />           kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />           comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />           trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other books<br />           to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy Englishseries too.<br />           I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />           5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and havethem in my<br />           Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />           books :))</p>
<p>           Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />           it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>           Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />           to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />           I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>           Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>           Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />           overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the worldand is<br />           considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />           World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />           memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>           I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintinfans are<br />           there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />           Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>              Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />              attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />              read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />              children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />              caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />              course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />              book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as<br />              far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />              all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />              boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />              British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>              The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references abouta few<br />              years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of theStates,<br />              France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not<br />              find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>              Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />              sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that<br />              she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />              very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />              and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />              time when I thought these were classics but that is no longerthere.</p>

        <p>Wow Venkat, that is indeed news!! So Herge was some kind of a guy with scientific insight as well..Now i must read Flight 714 to see what was anti semitic in it..i have jewish friends also in the tintin fan club i belong to..have not heard this though. People thinking of Hitler's New Order as smnething positive initially is not at all unusual, lot of people did.</p>

<p>        Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>         My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has slowly transferred to silver screen adaptations. .given limited time. The BBC series on both are amazing and have seen them a few hundred times.</p>

<p>             It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />             kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to readtintin<br />             comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />             trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to readother books<br />             to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series too.<br />             I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />             5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in my<br />             Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />             books :))</p>
<p>             Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />             it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>             Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />             to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />             I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>             Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>             Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />             overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />             considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />             World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />             memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>             I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are<br />             there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />             Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />                attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it betteryou have to<br />                read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almostall the<br />                children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />                caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />                course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />                book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma.That is as<br />                far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls haveany careers,<br />                all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives andmothers and<br />                boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />                British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />                years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />                France and Germany too - but given our own colonial historywe did not<br />                find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>                Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />                sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The pointalso is that<br />                she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />                very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />                and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />                time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>      Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>           Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />           to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />           I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>           Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />           overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the worldand is<br />           considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />           World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />           memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>           I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintinfans are<br />           there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />           Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>              Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />              attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />              read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />              children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />              caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />              course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />              book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as<br />              far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />              all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />              boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />              British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>              The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references abouta few<br />              years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of theStates,<br />              France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not<br />              find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>              Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />              sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that<br />              she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />              very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />              and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />              time when I thought these were classics but that is no longerthere.</p>

<p>                famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />                kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny now.<br />                if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />                fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />                fatty.<br />                does he come in secret seven?</p>

<p>    I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to namethe prominent few.?Just loved it.</p>

The point also is that<br />            she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />            very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />            and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />            time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>  Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>       It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' clubof<br />       kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />       comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - bothinvite<br />       trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read otherbooks<br />       to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series too.<br />       I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />       5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in my<br />       Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />       books :))</p>
<p>       Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />       it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>       Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a characterI loved<br />       to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />       I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>       Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />       overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world andis<br />       considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />       World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotelsand<br />       memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>       I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are<br />       there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />       Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>          Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no differentfrom<br />          attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />          read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />          children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />          caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />          course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />          book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as<br />          far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />          all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />          boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />          British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>          The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />          years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />          France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not<br />          find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>

<p>     It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />     kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />     comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />     trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other books<br />     to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series too.<br />     I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed toget<br />     5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in my<br />     Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />     books :))</p>
<p>     Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />     it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>     Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character Iloved<br />     to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />     I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>     Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>     Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think sobut<br />     overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />     considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />     World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />     memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>     I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are<br />     there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />     Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>        Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />        attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />        read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />        children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />        caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />        course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />        book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That isas<br />        far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />        all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothersand<br />        boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />        British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>        The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />        years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />        France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not<br />        find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>        Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />        sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also isthat<br />        she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children loveso<br />        very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browsenow<br />        and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />        time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>        Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might thinkso<br />    but<br />        overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />        considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to winthe<br />        World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels<br />    and<br />        memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>        I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans<br />    are<br />        there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />        Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>         You are right maloo.<br />         racism should be seen in literature taking into context the years it<br />    was<br />         written in.<br />         a book is a mirror of its times.<br />         now my other favourite tintin is accused of being racist</p>

<p>           Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />    from<br />           attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have<br />    to<br />           read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />           children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />           caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes.<br />    Of<br />           course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />           book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. Thatis<br />    as<br />           far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />    careers,<br />           all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />    and<br />           boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all<br />    that is<br />           British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>           The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />           years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the<br />    States,<br />           France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />    not<br />           find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>           Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />           sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point alsois<br />    that<br />           she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />    so<br />           very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />    now<br />           and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />           time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>             Hi Maloo<br />             blyton racist?? its so far into the past i dont remember<br />    instances.</p>
<p>             my favourite was the one in which the lands change everyday above<br />    a<br />             magic tree<br />             one land was the land of rhymes where you had to answer to every<br />    query<br />             with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>             famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />             kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny<br />    now.<br />             if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />             fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />             fatty.<br />             does he come in secret seven?</p>

Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />      World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels<br />  and<br />      memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>      I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans<br />  are<br />      there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />      Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>         Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />  from<br />         attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have<br />  to<br />         read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />         children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />         caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes.<br />  Of<br />         course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />         book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is<br />  as<br />         far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />  careers,<br />         all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />  and<br />         boys have to protect and guard girls all the time.

<p>         The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />         years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the<br />  States,<br />         France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />  not<br />         find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>         Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />         sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is<br />  that<br />         she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />  so<br />         very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />  now<br />         and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring.

        <p>I have the whole new collection, set of 3s..also two supplementary books detailing the history of tintin books and the art work which has enhanced over the years. (The original tintin artwork is somewhat like the originial mickey mouse..very bare bones..).</p>
<p>My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has slowly transferred to silver screen adaptations..given limited time. The BBC series on both areamazing and have seen them a few hundred times.</p>

<p>    It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />    kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />    comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />    trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other books<br />    to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English seriestoo.<br />    I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />    5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in my<br />    Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />    books :))</p>
<p>    Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacisedby<br />    it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>    Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />    to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />    I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>    Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>  tintin in congo is being sued right now</p>
<p>  from wiki</p>
<p>  'Tintin in the Congo has often been criticised as having racist and colonialist views, as well as several scenes of violence against animals. Hergé later said that he was portraying the naïve, colonialist views of the time.

<p>  i love tintin.<br />  my favourite is captain haddock especially when he is running away from bianca castofiore's hugs.</p>
<p>  in fact a couple of scenes from kaviri mainthan have a very close resemblance to tintin scenes. i promise it was totally un intentional and my son found it out two years after it was published</p>

<p>        Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have toread her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers, all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is British is good and perfect. </p>
<p>        The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a fewyears ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States, France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not find it objectionable but most people from other countries do. </p>
<p>        Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so verymuch. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>      The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States, Franceand Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not find it objectionable but most people from other countries do. </p>
<p>      Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>  Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />  overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />  considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />  World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />  memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>  I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are<br />  there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />  Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>     Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />     attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />     read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />     children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />     caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />     course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />     book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as<br />     far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />     all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />     boys have to protect and guard girls all the time.

Of course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers, all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is British is good and perfect. </p>
<p>    The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States, France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not find it objectionable but most people from other countries do. </p>
<p>    Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>        PAvithra, yes Blyton is a great story teller, despite her unashamed racism :) My favorite is the Frederick Trotteville series what is yours ?</p>
<p>      Hi Maloo<br />      blyton racist?? its so far into the past i dont remember instances.</p>
<p>      my favourite was the one in which the lands change everyday above a magic tree<br />      one land was the land of rhymes where you had to answer to every query with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>      famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny now.<br />      if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />      fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called fatty.<br />      does he come in secret seven?</p>
<p>      of course after blyton boys branch out to hardy boys and girls to mills and boons.<br />      venketesh</p>

        <p>Pavithra, yes i agree 100% on Blyton.</p>
<p>If you like food descriptions i highly recommend this lady named Bharti Kirschner who is also a culinary writer. Her novels Pastries andd Darjeeling are packed with food descriptions in the most luscious manner possible. Especially pastries is about a lady running a bakery somewhere in seattle. After i finished that book i had such a long craving for cakes and put on quitesome weight :))</p>

        <p>Maloo - probably one of the Famous Five series. I liked them, but lost<br />interest in that after a while. Fatty still remains my favourite. Like you<br />said, she opened up avenues as far as imagination went. I learnt to explore<br />strange new worlds through her. I might not agree with everything she wrote,<br />but it was a different world, and I liked that experience.</p>
<p>Re the food: yup, I enjoy descriptions of food, even if they're meat-based<br />(and I'm a confirmed veggie) - maybe its just the way she used her words<br />that did it. :) For that matter, I go after foodie-descriptions wherever I<br />find them. All those foodie examples in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , for instance (ohhh, that<br />varagarisi choru ...)<br />Balakumaran's inserted a lot of foodie-stuff in his Udayar - it feels like<br />its been thrust in, but I still like them.</acronym></p>
<p>There's another example of wonderfully foodie descriptions in one of Stella<br />Bruce's novels - Panangattu Annachi. Its so full of food stuff that the<br />instinct to burp after a particularly gourmet (!) experience is<br />overwhelming</p>
<p>Cheers, P.</p>

        <p>Pav, you enjoy british descriptions of food?? Quite unusual for an indian since it is mostly meat based. I loved the sense of adventure Blyton bought,i dont remember which book/series it was but where they camp on an island and live off of food there. Even in the school books the tricks those students play and midnight parties were ultimate hilarious stuff. So was the 'faraway tree' series venkat described where the trees used have different 'lands' was in many ways like disney for kids who had never known such stuff.</p>
<p>Blyton also wrote very well on life on farms and animals. She instilled love of animals and wildlife and adventure, i think she has more to her creditdespite the racist/sexist stuff.<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pavithra Srinivasan<br />

        <p>Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are there among the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>    Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of course Asian kids donteven deserve mention , there is one adventure book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as far as she came as far as asiansgo. None of the girls have any careers, all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is British is good and perfect. </p>
<p>    The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States, France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not find it objectionable but most people from other countries do. </p>
<p>    Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>
