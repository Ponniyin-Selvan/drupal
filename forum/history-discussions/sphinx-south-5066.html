<p>interesting read</p>
<p>I would like to recount to you, dear reader, how the purushamriga <br />was brought to earth. The purushamriga is a rishi, a sage with the <br />body of a lion and a human face. This composite mythological being <br />was called a sphinx in ancient Greece and Egypt. </p>
<p>Five kings, brothers, known as the Pancha Pandavas, ruled <br />Indraprastha. For the prosperity of their kingdom they wished to <br />perform the Rajasuya Yajna, the royal Vedic sacrifice. To seek <br />divine support for the performance of this ritual, one of the <br />brothers, the hero Bhima, went to ask the help of Kubera, the <br />guardian deity of the North. In Kubera's garden he met the divine <br />being, the purushamriga, or human-beast, whom he invited to guard <br />and attend the Rajasuya Yajna. Challenging Bhima, the purushamriga <br />agreed to attend. Being a staunch worshipper of Lord Shiva he <br />insisted Bhima must go before him without halting, without <br />disturbing his meditation. If Bhima failed, the purushamriga would <br />eat him. Although Bhima was a great athlete, the purushamriga <br />quickly neared him. </p>
<p>Lord Krishna had given Bhima magical stones which, when thrown over <br />his shoulder, became Shiva temples. The purushamriga worshipped <br />Shiva before following Bhima. Thus throwing the stones one by one, <br />Bhima reached Indraprastha. But just before he could cross into his <br />kingdom, the purushamriga caught one of his feet. Dharma, the elder <br />brother, judged the purushamriga had the right to eat half of <br />Bhima's body. The purushamriga explained he was satisfied with <br />Dharma's justice and would not eat Bhima. After the completion of <br />the Rajasuya the purushamriga asked Dharma "my task is over, where I <br />should go now?" Dharma's answer was that he should go to Tillai-<br />Chidambaram, where Shiva would shortly arrive to perform his cosmic <br />dance. He should guard the entrance and ward off negative influence.</p>
<p>On a raised platform, two sphinxes are sitting on either side of a <br />grand doorway, guarding the entrance of an ancient temple. It is <br />said they ward off evil and remove the sins of those who pass <br />between them. A mysterious smile adorns their human faces, which are <br />surrounded by full lion manes. One is male, the other is female, and <br />as a faithful couple they have been seated in this way side by side <br />for many centuries.</p>
<p>Have we just entered an ancient Egyptian temple, or walked through <br />the gate of a Greek shrine from long ago? No, we are in India. <br />Visiting the famous temple in Chidambaram where Shiva Nataraja <br />dances his cosmic dance for all humanity. These sphinxes are the <br />purushamrigas of the legend. They have the body of a lion, and the <br />face of a human being. </p>
<p>In Indian art and culture the existence and presence of the sphinx <br />as a mythological being has so far gone unnoticed and unrecognized. <br />But through many years of research I have found that the sphinx <br />plays a significant role in the arts and traditions of many temples <br />in India. And not only in the art, but also in ritual and legend. </p>
<p>I became aware of the identity between the purushamrigas guarding <br />the main entrance of the temple where I spend so much of my life, <br />and the mythological being called sphinx from ancient Egypt and <br />Greece, as far back as 1986. Since I have been on a quest to uncover <br />the mysteries and riddles that surround them. And now I can present <br />a comprehensive report to the world.</p>
<p>In South India, in Tamil Nadu, we find sculptures of the <br />purushamriga situated in ritually significant places in many <br />temples. Usually near an entrance, often in the passage through the <br />gopuram, or on its fa?ade. But also on pillars adjoining the <br />sanctum. And in the pavilions used for the festivals. Not all the <br />purushamrigas look exactly like the sphinx of Western antiquity. In <br />South Indian art we find mainly two types. The type mostly <br />resembling the classical image of a sphinx is those that have fully <br />lion's bodies with human faces. </p>
<p>Some, especially sculptures from more recent centuries, are lions <br />from the waist down, and fully human from the waist up. Some are <br />depicted as rishis or seers, having a beard and with their hair <br />knotted on the top of their head. They may be worshipping a Shiva <br />Linga with a bell and lamp. Some are virulent warriors, brandishing <br />a club or a sword. A beautiful pair of purushamrigas stands to <br />welcome the visitors to the mandapa in front of the Subrahmania <br />shrine in the Brihadishvara temple in Tanjore, their hands folded in <br />the anjalimudra of greeting. They are standing as tall as a man. Two <br />pairs of small crouching sphinxes are positioned in the gopuram of <br />the Sarangapani temple in Kumbakonam. And depictions of the legend <br />of Bhima and the purushamriga are decorating the temples in <br />Darasuram, Tribhuvanam, and Tiruvannamalai. The Indian sphinx is <br />also found in Vishnu temples. As many as three are found in the <br />Varadaraja Perumal temple in Tribhuvanai, near Pondicherry. And I <br />understand there are many more waiting to be found.</p>
<p>Not only are these sphinxes important in art. They also play a role <br />in all Shaiva temple ritual. Among the lamps offered during the <br />ceremony of the 16 upacaras, one is the purushamriga lamp. While <br />presenting the lamp the priest chants a verse from the Krishna <br />Yajurveda. And a few temples even have a purushamriga as the vahana <br />or vehicle of the deity in the processions of the temple festival. <br />So far I have found purushamriga vahanas in the Ekambaranatha temple <br />in Kanchipuram, in Tiruvannamalai, in Tirumangalakudi, and Ulsoor in <br />Bangalore. </p>
<p>But the presence of sphinxes in Indian temples is not limited to <br />Tamil Nadu only. My research has discovered this mythological being <br />is represented in the art of other parts of India as well. The <br />earliest examples can be found among Buddhist and Jain art from the <br />Kausambi. But also from Jain caves in Orissa. In medieval Orissan <br />art we find beings called nara-virala. Beautiful and ferocious they <br />too are half lion, half human. They appear among the friezes of the <br />Surya temple in Konarak and in many other places as well. Other <br />examples have been found in Hampi, Srisailam, Northern Karnataka, on <br />the brick temples of Bengal. And they are called nara-simha in the <br />art of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>This discovery of the role and significance of the sphinx in Indian <br />art and civilization contributes to the wealth and beauty of the <br />Indian heritage. And it will bring a new understanding of the place <br />of India in the perspective of world history. Its artistic <br />expression shines a fresh light on India and its place among the <br />great civilizations of ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Now I have reached a significant phase in my research. Many <br />questions are haunting my mind. What is the relationship between the <br />sphinxes of India and ancient Egypt? How and why did the sphinx <br />achieve such an important place in Indian myth and ritual? Why was <br />the verse from the Yajurveda chosen for the worship with the <br />purushamriga lamp? And are the sphinxes found in other parts of <br />India identical with the purushamriga of Tamil Nadu?</p>

<p>  I would like to recount to you, dear reader, how the purushamriga <br />  was brought to earth. The purushamriga is a rishi, a sage with the <br />  body of a lion and a human face. This composite mythological being <br />  was called a sphinx in ancient Greece and Egypt. </p>
<p>  Five kings, brothers, known as the Pancha Pandavas, ruled <br />  Indraprastha. For the prosperity of their kingdom they wished to <br />  perform the Rajasuya Yajna, the royal Vedic sacrifice. To seek <br />  divine support for the performance of this ritual, one of the <br />  brothers, the hero Bhima, went to ask the help of Kubera, the <br />  guardian deity of the North. In Kubera's garden he met the divine <br />  being, the purushamriga, or human-beast, whom he invited to guard <br />  and attend the Rajasuya Yajna. Challenging Bhima, the purushamriga <br />  agreed to attend. Being a staunch worshipper of Lord Shiva he <br />  insisted Bhima must go before him without halting, without <br />  disturbing his meditation. If Bhima failed, the purushamriga would <br />  eat him. Although Bhima was a great athlete, the purushamriga <br />  quickly neared him. </p>
<p>  Lord Krishna had given Bhima magical stones which, when thrown <br />over <br />  his shoulder, became Shiva temples. The purushamriga worshipped <br />  Shiva before following Bhima. Thus throwing the stones one by one, <br />  Bhima reached Indraprastha. But just before he could cross into <br />his <br />  kingdom, the purushamriga caught one of his feet. Dharma, the <br />elder <br />  brother, judged the purushamriga had the right to eat half of <br />  Bhima's body. The purushamriga explained he was satisfied with <br />  Dharma's justice and would not eat Bhima. After the completion of <br />  the Rajasuya the purushamriga asked Dharma "my task is over, where <br />I <br />  should go now?" Dharma's answer was that he should go to Tillai-<br />  Chidambaram, where Shiva would shortly arrive to perform his <br />cosmic <br />  dance. He should guard the entrance and ward off negative <br />influence.</p>
<p>  On a raised platform, two sphinxes are sitting on either side of a <br />  grand doorway, guarding the entrance of an ancient temple. It is <br />  said they ward off evil and remove the sins of those who pass <br />  between them. A mysterious smile adorns their human faces, which <br />are <br />  surrounded by full lion manes. One is male, the other is female, <br />and <br />  as a faithful couple they have been seated in this way side by <br />side <br />  for many centuries.</p>
<p>  Have we just entered an ancient Egyptian temple, or walked through <br />  the gate of a Greek shrine from long ago? No, we are in India. <br />  Visiting the famous temple in Chidambaram where Shiva Nataraja <br />  dances his cosmic dance for all humanity. These sphinxes are the <br />  purushamrigas of the legend. They have the body of a lion, and the <br />  face of a human being. </p>
<p>  In Indian art and culture the existence and presence of the sphinx <br />  as a mythological being has so far gone unnoticed and <br />unrecognized. <br />  But through many years of research I have found that the sphinx <br />  plays a significant role in the arts and traditions of many <br />temples <br />  in India. And not only in the art, but also in ritual and legend. </p>
<p>  I became aware of the identity between the purushamrigas guarding <br />  the main entrance of the temple where I spend so much of my life, <br />  and the mythological being called sphinx from ancient Egypt and <br />  Greece, as far back as 1986. Since I have been on a quest to <br />uncover <br />  the mysteries and riddles that surround them. And now I can <br />present <br />  a comprehensive report to the world.</p>
<p>  In South India, in Tamil Nadu, we find sculptures of the <br />  purushamriga situated in ritually significant places in many <br />  temples. Usually near an entrance, often in the passage through <br />the <br />  gopuram, or on its fa硤e. But also on pillars adjoining the <br />  sanctum. And in the pavilions used for the festivals. Not all the <br />  purushamrigas look exactly like the sphinx of Western antiquity. <br />In <br />  South Indian art we find mainly two types. The type mostly <br />  resembling the classical image of a sphinx is those that have <br />fully <br />  lion's bodies with human faces. </p>
<p>  Some, especially sculptures from more recent centuries, are lions <br />  from the waist down, and fully human from the waist up. Some are <br />  depicted as rishis or seers, having a beard and with their hair <br />  knotted on the top of their head. They may be worshipping a Shiva <br />  Linga with a bell and lamp. Some are virulent warriors, <br />brandishing <br />  a club or a sword. A beautiful pair of purushamrigas stands to <br />  welcome the visitors to the mandapa in front of the Subrahmania <br />  shrine in the Brihadishvara temple in Tanjore, their hands folded <br />in <br />  the anjalimudra of greeting. They are standing as tall as a man. <br />Two <br />  pairs of small crouching sphinxes are positioned in the gopuram of <br />  the Sarangapani temple in Kumbakonam. And depictions of the legend <br />  of Bhima and the purushamriga are decorating the temples in <br />  Darasuram, Tribhuvanam, and Tiruvannamalai. The Indian sphinx is <br />  also found in Vishnu temples. As many as three are found in the <br />  Varadaraja Perumal temple in Tribhuvanai, near Pondicherry. And I <br />  understand there are many more waiting to be found.</p>
<p>  Not only are these sphinxes important in art. They also play a <br />role <br />  in all Shaiva temple ritual. Among the lamps offered during the <br />  ceremony of the 16 upacaras, one is the purushamriga lamp. While <br />  presenting the lamp the priest chants a verse from the Krishna <br />  Yajurveda. And a few temples even have a purushamriga as the <br />vahana <br />  or vehicle of the deity in the processions of the temple festival. <br />  So far I have found purushamriga vahanas in the Ekambaranatha <br />temple <br />  in Kanchipuram, in Tiruvannamalai, in Tirumangalakudi, and Ulsoor <br />in <br />  Bangalore. </p>
<p>  But the presence of sphinxes in Indian temples is not limited to <br />  Tamil Nadu only. My research has discovered this mythological <br />being <br />  is represented in the art of other parts of India as well. The <br />  earliest examples can be found among Buddhist and Jain art from <br />the <br />  Kausambi. But also from Jain caves in Orissa. In medieval Orissan <br />  art we find beings called nara-virala. Beautiful and ferocious <br />they <br />  too are half lion, half human. They appear among the friezes of <br />the <br />  Surya temple in Konarak and in many other places as well. Other <br />  examples have been found in Hampi, Srisailam, Northern Karnataka, <br />on <br />  the brick temples of Bengal. And they are called nara-simha in the <br />  art of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>  This discovery of the role and significance of the sphinx in <br />Indian <br />  art and civilization contributes to the wealth and beauty of the <br />  Indian heritage. And it will bring a new understanding of the <br />place <br />  of India in the perspective of world history. Its artistic <br />  expression shines a fresh light on India and its place among the <br />  great civilizations of ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>  Now I have reached a significant phase in my research. Many <br />  questions are haunting my mind. What is the relationship between <br />the <br />  sphinxes of India and ancient Egypt? How and why did the sphinx <br />  achieve such an important place in Indian myth and ritual? Why was <br />  the verse from the Yajurveda chosen for the worship with the <br />  purushamriga lamp? And are the sphinxes found in other parts of <br />  India identical with the purushamriga of Tamil Nadu?</p>

<p>Yeah. Interesting indeed.</p>
<p>In Darasuram temple, there are couple of sculptures - which are the <br />forms originally described in the Greek Legend Odizy. There was an <br />elderly Guide Balu (passed away last year ) who described this <br />authoritatively !</p>
<p>Big temple Muruga is of Nayak origin.</p>
<p>we have to go more into details.</p>
<p>Also recall, the rocks were separated using the Age old Egypt <br />technique according to archeologists and they show certain examples <br />in Mamallapuram.</p>
<p>Trade connections with Egypt and Greek were much common even from <br />Sangam Age !</p>
<p>We should look for more details.</p>

And it will bring a new understanding of the <br />place <br />  of India in the perspective of world history. Its artistic <br />  expression shines a fresh light on India and its place among the <br />  great civilizations of ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>  Now I have reached a significant phase in my research. Many <br />  questions are haunting my mind. What is the relationship between <br />the <br />  sphinxes of India and ancient Egypt? How and why did the sphinx <br />  achieve such an important place in Indian myth and ritual? Why was <br />  the verse from the Yajurveda chosen for the worship with the <br />  purushamriga lamp? And are the sphinxes found in other parts of <br />  India identical with the purushamriga of Tamil Nadu?</p>
