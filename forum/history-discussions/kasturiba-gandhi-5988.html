<p>   Also just fyi, I do not know about all of Gandhi's progeny. I know<br />  for certain Arun Gandhi, one of his grandsons, is hardly a<br />  sensationalist. He runs a centre for peace in Memphis, and is a<br />  highly respected figure in public here in US. As for Rajmohan<br />  Gandhi, my uncle who knows much of the family mentioned him also to<br />  be a sincere person. The book is not a best seller by any stretch of<br />  imagination for him to rake in the money. He made mention of the<br />  incident perhaps to deal with the burden of hero worship and<br />  idealisation that plagues many celebrity families. (Lincoln's<br />  grandson even reportedly changed his last name to get away from it).</p>

<p>     Hi Malati,</p>
<p>     First of all Good morning Malati. What's the time now out there<br />  in<br />   US? Early in the morning even before you brush your teeth you open<br />  up<br />   PS group mails and start replying to the discussion which took<br />  plavce<br />   when you were fast alseep or what? Kidding. Don't take it<br />  seriously!</p>
<p>     VJ,</p>
<p>     For records -- Bengali woman in Gandhi's life is not mentioned<br />  in<br />   Freedom at Midnight. It was there in a English Weekly (India Today<br />  or<br />   something like that, not sure of the book).</p>
<p>     I am in the middle of my mid year appraisal and I have to list<br />  what<br />   and all I have done in the past 6 months. Being active in PS and 6<br />   other Yahoo! groups will not be counted as my achievements. So<br />   scratching my head ... Will be back with a bang on this on Monday.</p>
<p>     Tonite I will be traveling to Chennai to attend my cousins<br />  wedding.<br />   Will be there till Friday and then weekend @ Home sweet home -<br />   Dindigul. Monday back to office -- To write about Gandhi Ji ...<br />  Oops<br />   I need to work also ... Chalo people catch you later.</p>
<p>     Gandhi Ji .... I will come back ....</p>

I said like anyone else that he was human and all that<br />  he<br />   did was not right, I don't agree with what he did in that regard<br />  and<br />   I believe it was due to his regard and adoption of the christian<br />   belief system in selective ways that led him to it.<br />     ?<br />     Would be interesting to hear more.<br />     ?<br />     Malathi<br />     ?<br />     --- On Wed, 7/2/08, R.venketesh <abhivencat@ yahoo. com  wrote:</p>

<p>     Hi<br />     gandhi's new biography by his grandson tells of his attraction<br />  to a<br />     bengali woman.<br />     it needed a lot of persuasion from other leaders like rajaji to<br />  ged<br />     rid of that fatal attraction.</p>

<p>Also just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym , I do not know about all of Gandhi's progeny. I know for certain Arun Gandhi, one of his grandsons, is hardly a sensationalist. He runs a centre for peace in Memphis, and is a highly respected figure in public here in US. As for Rajmohan Gandhi, my uncle who knows much of the family mentioned him also to be a sincere person. The book is not a best seller by any stretch of imagination for him to rake in the money. He made mention of the incident perhaps to deal with the burden of hero worship and idealisation that plagues many celebrity families. (Lincoln's grandson even reportedly changed his last name to get away from it).</p>

<p>As far as the other woman, a blip can be blown out of proportion, as <br />far as Gandhi is concerned, his +ives out weigh his -ives. <br />Yes, he has had some bad judgements and decisions, well, we were not <br />a democracy then so had to follow a monarchial idea, just that in <br />this case, the prime person was a peace lover. </p>
<p>Gandhi had done nothing memorable for his family, may be this is <br />something he did so they can survive out of their skills of the pen. <br />A scoop, most times, sells better than the truth.<br />Every one has a last temptation, many brush it and move on, many dont <br />recognize it for the entirity of their lives, but most humans are <br />prone to temptation, the 'WWW' is a massive deception.<br />I have read once that the only people who do not fall to temptation <br />are those who do not get the opportunity or those who have crushed <br />their senses, for all others its a fight, some win, some lose.<br />Gandhi, according to me won. So..no hard no foul, hence my question <br />is... so what if even he did? </p>
<p>I would not accept the lines of vairamuthu that...aangalil Raman <br />kidayathu... punayil saivam kidayathu... Those who fight and win, land <br />up in the path of Rama. </p>
<p>Only Rama could resist Surpanaka's charm, even the greatest of all <br />Rishis such as vishwamitra could not. </p>

<p>  Hi<br />  gandhi's new biography by his grandson tells of his attraction to a <br />  bengali woman.<br />  it needed a lot of persuasion from other leaders like rajaji to ged <br />  rid of that fatal attraction.</p>

<p>that is a huge burden to carry for ordinary people. We should not <br />really expect Gandhi's clan or Bharthiyar's clan to be like them or <br />uphold something for us to feel good about, they are all ordinary <br />people and celebrities rarely have time for their families. </p>

        <p>Also just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym , I do not know about all of Gandhi's progeny. I know for certain Arun Gandhi, one of his grandsons, is hardly a sensationalist. He runs a centre for peace in Memphis, and is a highly respected figure in public here in US. As for Rajmohan Gandhi, my uncle who knows much of the family mentioned him also to be a sincere person. The book is not a best seller by any stretch of imagination for him to rake in the money. He made mention of the incident perhaps to deal with the burden of hero worship and idealisation that plagues many celebrity families.

<p>As far as the other woman, a blip can be blown out of proportion, as <br />far as Gandhi is concerned, his +ives out weigh his -ives. <br />Yes, he has had some bad judgements and decisions, well, we were not <br />a democracy then so had to follow a monarchial idea, just that in <br />this case, the prime person was a peace lover. </p>
<p>Gandhi had done nothing memorable for his family, may be this is <br />something he did so they can survive out of their skills of the pen. <br />A scoop, most times, sells better than the truth.<br />Every one has a last temptation, many brush it and move on, many dont <br />recognize it for the entirity of their lives, but most humans are <br />prone to temptation, the 'WWW' is a massive deception.<br />I have read once that the only people who do not fall to temptation <br />are those who do not get the opportunity or those who have crushed <br />their senses, for all others its a fight, some win, some lose.<br />Gandhi, according to me won. So..no hard no foul, hence my question <br />is... so what if even he did? </p>
<p>I would not accept the lines of vairamuthu that...aangalil Raman <br />kidayathu... punayil saivam kidayathu... Those who fight and win, land <br />up in the path of Rama. </p>
<p>Only Rama could resist Surpanaka's charm, even the greatest of all <br />Rishis such as vishwamitra could not. </p>

<p>  Hi<br />  gandhi's new biography by his grandson tells of his attraction to a <br />  bengali woman.<br />  it needed a lot of persuasion from other leaders like rajaji to ged <br />  rid of that fatal attraction.</p>
<p>  i guess he came very close to ejecting kasturiba from his life.</p>

        <p>Yes perhaps, but Gandhi was not Rama or Laxmana, he was a human like any ofus who became great due to his conviction and strong sense of self. The point behind the stories such as this is not to idealise humans, or trash them for their frailities, unfortunately both of these extremes happen to be common in our country. Also not to forget the whole point is that Kasturba deserves no less credit than Gandhi, an oft forgotten fact - without her there would be no Gandhi and none of us justifying what he did one way or the other!!</p>

<p>  Hi<br />  gandhi's new biography by his grandson tells of his attraction to a <br />  bengali woman.<br />  it needed a lot of persuasion from other leaders like rajaji to ged <br />  rid of that fatal attraction.</p>

<p>Hi Malati,</p>
<p>First of all Good morning Malati. What's the time now out there in US? Early in the morning even before you brush your teeth you open up <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group mails and start replying to the discussion which took plavce when you were fastalseep or what? Kidding. Don't take it seriously!</p>
<p>VJ,</p>
<p>For records -- Bengali woman in Gandhi's life is not mentioned in Freedom at Midnight. It was there in a English Weekly (India Today or something likethat, not sure of the book).</p>
<p>I am in the middle of my mid year appraisal and I have to list what and allI have done in the past 6 months. Being active in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and 6 other Yahoo! groups will not be counted as my achievements. So scratching my head ... Willbe back with a bang on this on Monday.</p>
<p>Tonite I will be traveling to Chennai to attend my cousins wedding. Will bethere till Friday and then weekend @ Home sweet home - Dindigul. Monday back to office -- To write about Gandhi Ji ... Oops I need to work also ... Chalo people catch you later.</p>
<p>Gandhi Ji .... I will come back ....</p>
<p>~ Udanx</p>
<p>PS: SPS, Next 2 days I will be in Madras Any <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  meeting happening so that Ican also contribute (By eating the Adayar Anandha Bhavan Seedai / Murukku which people use to talk about) Yenakku illa yenakku illa (Read it in Dharumi Style Film Tiruvilayaadal)</p>

<p>I don't think there is anything wrong in discussing a celebrity's personal life as long as we <br />are not doing any 'yellow journalism' here, meaning deliberate intention tomalign someone should not be there. Udanx, we are all adults, not children, and most people know how to write as far as i can see. As a woman i take no disrespect to the nature of such discussion as long as people know how to say what they say that is all. <br />?<br />I have not heard of any Bengali woman in GAndhi's life although not read this book yet. I do know for a fact that Ba had an extremely hard time with him, he treated her almost like a servant many times and it took many years for him to acknowledge her as a true person. It may also be due to the general nature of treatment of women in those days but it does not excuse his behavior.<br />?<br />I gave a talk on GAndhi a long time ago for a class on indian cultural awareness and was asked in a forum of over 300 people, mostly whites, what did I think of GAndhi's experiments with celibacy. I said like anyone else thathe was human and all that he did was not right, I don't agree with what hedid in that regard and I believe it was due to his regard and adoption of the christian belief system in selective ways that led him to it.<br />?<br />Would be interesting to hear more.<br />?<br />Malathi<br />?<br />--- On Wed, 7/2/08, R.venketesh <abhivencat@yahoo. com  wrote:</p>

<p>Hi<br />gandhi's new biography by his grandson tells of his attraction to a <br />bengali woman.<br />it needed a lot of persuasion from other leaders like rajaji to ged <br />rid of that fatal attraction.</p>
<p>i guess he came very close to ejecting kasturiba from his life.</p>

It is very informative on conflicts and personal challenges, also has Rajaji's golden words to Gandhi which would make sense in any age and era.<br />?<br /><a href="http://watandost.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-biography-of-gandhi-written-by-his.html" title="http://watandost.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-biography-of-gandhi-written-by-his.html">http://watandost.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-biography-of-gandhi-written-by...</a></p>

        <p>Hi Malati,</p>
<p>First of all Good morning Malati. What's the time now out there in US? Early<br />in the morning even before you brush your teeth you open up <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group mails<br />and start replying to the discussion which took plavce when you were fast<br />alseep or what? Kidding. Don't take it seriously!</acronym></p>
<p>VJ,</p>
<p>For records -- Bengali woman in Gandhi's life is not mentioned in Freedom at<br />Midnight. It was there in a English Weekly (India Today or something like<br />that, not sure of the book).</p>
<p>I am in the middle of my mid year appraisal and I have to list what and all<br />I have done in the past 6 months. Being active in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and 6 other Yahoo!<br />groups will not be counted as my achievements. So scratching my head ...<br />Will be back with a bang on this on Monday.</acronym></p>
<p>Tonite I will be traveling to Chennai to attend my cousins wedding. Will be<br />there till Friday and then weekend @ Home sweet home - Dindigul. Monday back<br />to office -- To write about Gandhi Ji ... Oops I need to work also ... Chalo<br />people catch you later.</p>
<p>Gandhi Ji .... I will come back ....</p>
<p>~ Udanx</p>
<p>*PS: SPS, Next 2 days I will be in Madras Any <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  meeting happening so that I<br />can also contribute (By eating the Adayar Anandha Bhavan Seedai / Murukku<br />which people use to talk about) Yenakku illa yenakku illa (Read it in<br />Dharumi Style Film Tiruvilayaadal)<br />*<br />On Wed, Jul 2, 2008 at 4:59 PM, Malathi Mahadevan <dmaloo@yahoo.com  wrote:</p></dmaloo@yahoo.com></acronym></p>

<p>  I have not heard of any Bengali woman in GAndhi's life although not read<br />  this book yet.

It may also be due to the<br />  general nature of treatment of women in those days but it does not excuse<br />  his behavior.</p>
<p>  I gave a talk on GAndhi a long time ago for a class on indian cultural<br />  awareness and was asked in a forum of over 300 people, mostly whites, what<br />  did I think of GAndhi's experiments with celibacy.

<p>  Hi<br />  gandhi's new biography by his grandson tells of his attraction to a<br />  bengali woman.<br />  it needed a lot of persuasion from other leaders like rajaji to ged<br />  rid of that fatal attraction.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Freedom at midnight is a book that i too relished reading - one for <br />showing me the Gandhi post independance - that three places would <br />burn on partition - lahore, amritsar and calcutta ( they have enough <br />neutral regiments to send to two places - one to lahore and one to <br />amrtisar - but to calcutta they send one man army ....the mahatma ), <br />secondly for the shortsightedness of our erstwhile maharajahs ( the <br />british apparently had a dossier of this kept ( blackmail) and one <br />of the requests to accede to india was that this must be <br />destroyed....</p>
<p>and lastly on how kashmir ( or atleast part of it came to india - <br />thanks to a cluster of nuns in a remote monastry in kashmir and <br />their tryst with the pathan raiders.....)</p>
<p>it does throw new light - but its also an account - so please take <br />it as such - its lord mountbatten's view ( a lot is already again <br />said of him and his wife)....so if he says when he was resting in a <br />hill resort - post independance - nehru and patel called him back - <br />telling him that they did not know how to control the free india - <br />he actually says he saw them sitting like school boys not knowing <br />what to do....</p>
<p>on the father of pak - sufferring from TB and hw it was kept secret <br />from even the british secret service didnt know about it - and if <br />they had known....</p>
<p>the initial chapters do kind of show the mahatma is different light -<br />especially the stutle remarks on how he refused modern medication <br />for his wife but later reversed his stand when it was neice. there <br />is also a mention of his ` experimentations with celibacy' but <br />pardon me there is no mention of this bengali connection in the book</p>

<p>  HI Udanx<br />  it may be out of context here, but i think that came up on myside<br />  because the topic was " kasturiba"</p>
<p>  but gandhi was not the typical politician and as madan said gandhi's<br />  only influence on all of us was not the freedom movement,<br />  his impact is much more and felt even today is felt inspite of the<br />  dilutions.<br />  so we just cannot compare his life with the routine politicians life.<br />  the article you read had an exerpt from the book.<br />  " gandhi's last temptation" they called it."</p>

        <p>Mathan,</p>
<p>In this forum there are any who are elder than me / learned than me /<br />knowledgeable than me and also people from the opposite sex. When we discuss<br />the personal life of people I may be forced to quote so many things which<br />will not be appropriate in this forum.</p>
<p>Again all that Gandhi said is not "Veda Vakku". <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  I am a student of<br />Gandhigram Rural Institute and I have discussed this offline with many of my<br />Professors who are staunch believers in Gandhian principles.</acronym></p>
<p>If he was such a saint as they claim why wasn't this made public in the<br />History or My Experiments with Truth. Hope you have read the book freedom at<br />midnight. Whats your take on Gandhi after reading that book.</p>

        <p>Venkatesh,</p>
<p>This was there as an article in India Today or some other famous English<br />magazine about this. Baring a few politicians the personal life of others --<br />Less said the better. In my humble opinion - Personal life of personalities<br />is not worth discussing in this forum where we discuss other useful things.</p>
