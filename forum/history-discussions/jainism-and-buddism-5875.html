<p>We can bring bring out salient details related to Jainism / <br />Buddism from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  / <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym . </p>
<p>In fact, Sivakami's " THALAIPPATTAL THALAIVAN THALE .. " (Appar's <br />hymns ) reminds me of the flash-back!</p>
<p>A synopsis on Jainism, Details on Theerthangars.</p>
<p>Similar Synopsis on Buddhism and The Monks Line of hierarchy - will <br />be useful.</p>
<p>How do both of them differ - Ideology - process of worship, period <br />etc and how / when did these Faith reach Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>A kind of comparitive study - related to Kalki's works...</p>
<p>just prior to Appar !</p>
<p>I am sure Vizag Dhivakar would have more details handy on this.</p>
<p>anbudan / </p>
<p>sps</p>
<p>some synopsis on Jainism.<br />Details on Theerthangars.</p>
<p>Separately on Buddhism.<br />Their Line of hierarchy.</p>
<p>How do both of them differ - Ideology - process of worship, period <br />etc.</p>
<p>Secondly, how / when did these Faith reach Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>This also may motivate more members to participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>Anbudan / sps</p>

<p>the Koon pandiyan and his queen mangayarkarasi. Appar's trials and <br />tribulations resulted in the Mahendra pallavan converting back to <br />Saivism but not in large scale conversion or torture of <br />Jain/Buddhists. Also my theory would be that since Pulikesi could <br />have support of jains, mahendra pallavan could have converted to <br />saivism to garner more support from the traditional saivite country <br />of southern tamilnadu.</p>

<p>    Probably the base to such legend would have been the Saiva,Jain<br />    ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar threw some <br />poetry <br />  on<br />    palm leaves into the river...to see which one came back to shore <br />and<br />    which left to prove the religions supremacy...</p>
<p>  Hi vairam</p>
<p>  The legend is appar engaged jains in a debate in front of mahendra <br />  pallava. the test was not floating palm leaves on water but a test <br />of <br />  fire...</p>
<p>  This happens after appar's reconversion back ( born as marul <br />  neeikiyaar - into jain faith as dharmasenar and then into the <br />shivaite <br />  faith as tiru navukkarasar ...fondly called as appar by gyana <br />  sambandar) - the king himself into the jain faith, was goaded by <br />the <br />  jain monks fearing the retribution of a popular jain monk <br />embracing <br />  shivism...led the king to subject appar to many tortures - incl <br />being <br />  confined into a cell for a week without food or water, being <br />poisoned, <br />  trying be crushed under an elephants foot and then finally being <br />tied <br />  to a stone and dropped into the sea....( dont want to take the <br />  comparison to the dasavataram again)....appar emerged unscathed <br />which <br />  sowed seeds of doubt into the kings mind... each of these episodes <br />are <br />  beautifully sung in tamil verse by appar ( its not for nothing <br />that he <br />  is called navukkuarasar - the king of the tongue)</p>
<p>  inorder to clear the doubt about which faith was stronger mahendra <br />  engaged appar with a debate with the jain monks...both argued for <br />long <br />  without any clear winner emerging...finally they agreed to a <br />  test...wherein each wrote a verse in palm leaf and threw it into a <br />  fire.....appar' s emerged unscathed but the jain work <br />perished...this <br />  made mahendra convert back to shivism ....and not much publisised <br />but <br />  has to be admitted - a brutal attack at wiping out the jain faith <br />in <br />  tamil land...which included impaling them on stakes ( kazuvil <br />  ettruthal), mass murder - leaving their bodies to be consumed by <br />dogs <br />  and foxs...etc. all these are also sung...the king also destroyed <br />a <br />  large number of jain schools and places of worship </p>
<p>  this is a very significant and turning point in tamil land, if not <br />for <br />  this - i would have had to sign off as vijay jain.....</p>

        <p>Hi<br />of course all these kings -hoysalas included lost a major battle with <br />malik. they sued for peace and tried to divert his attention to other <br />lands.</p>
<p>i dont think there was nay arbitaration in pandya affairs.<br />sundara murdered the reigning king of of pandyas- his father <br />kulasekara.<br />he was chased out by his half brother who had a strangle hold on all <br />the land.<br />sundara was not in possesion of any territory when he sought malik's <br />aid.</p>
<p>as for vir bhallaala, he sent a mystic charecter called <br />thiruvegambaraayan as malik's interpreter and guide( from folk lore)</p>
<p>rayan along with malik witnessed the stone elephants eating sugarcane <br />at madurai temple.</p>
<p>bhallala tried to repent very late in life. he tried to capture <br />madurai from the madurai sultanate( with whom he had very cordial <br />relations for 2 decades)<br />however he was captured , skinned and his skin was stuffed with <br />straw and hung from the ramparts of madurai.<br />this was even mentioned by some foreign traveller( batuta if I <br />remember right)<br />madurai had to wait for kempenna for releif.</p>

<p>  HI Sathish</p>
<p>  malik was like shane warnes captaincy.<br />  one strategy for one war.<br />  he never even entered warangal but was satisfie d with all the gold <br />  and the kohinoor diamond.<br />  he captured the yadava king of deogiri and sent him to delhi where <br />  allaudin rather than choping off his head rearded him with a title <br />  and jewels.<br />  malik never beleived in having enemies at his rear. made more <br />friends <br />  than enemies.<br />  and really i am not able to find many instances of him destroying <br />  temples till tamil nadu.<br />  his assault on madurai was aided by the hoysalas - vir bhallala 2.<br />  the latter guided him up to madurai. sundara pandyans role was very <br />  limited and he deserted malik halfway to madurai.</p>
<p>  in fact the turks under malik were beaten and chased out by the <br />  regrouped pandyas in a month led by vikrama pandya. but by then the <br />  loot had all reached delhi</p>

        <p>Hi,<br />This may not be the factual truth.<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veera_Ballala_III" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veera_Ballala_III">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veera_Ballala_III</a><br />Pandya affairs<br />Ballala III successfully arbitered in the affairs of Tamil country by appointing Sundara Pandya as the Pandya king as opposed to his competitor, Vira Pandya. This was during 1311. However his focus on Tamil affairs laid open the northern boundaries of his territories to the invasion of Malik Kafur, commander of Sultan of Delhi, All-ud-din-Khilji. Halebidu was attacked and plundered. Veera Ballala had to accept defeat to the Delhi Sulthan and his son Veera Virupaksha Ballala was sent to Delhi as an act of peace. His son returned in 1313.<br />So Kafur did attack Halebidu<br />Regards<br />Nanda</p>

        <p>Dear Satish,<br />wards the islam soldiers were treated with higher respect among the others in any army, including the later Vijayanagara Empire Army. (Vijayanagara too had islamic soldiers with their side - reference Burten in 'Vizianagaram'). <br />&nbsp; Any new convert always shows his sincerety in stronger way. But when we talk of his cruelty in our country, you will have to see his end at Sultan's hand in another ten years time at Delhi. It was more cruel.<br />&nbsp; And one interesting Book on Kattabomman. Mr.Raja Mohammed of Pudukottai recently wrote that Kattabomman's royalty towards British was more stronger than other Palayakarars. And Kattabomman did pay kisti, etc., etc.,(remember the famous dialogues of Shivaji) to British Collectors and all were recorded in revenue registers, Raja Mohamed gave lot of references. &nbsp;Also he denied the involvement of Sethupathi of Ramnad in Kattabomman' capture. <br />&nbsp; One 'Pudhukai Thendral' a monthly by Thiru Dharmarajan carried this serial for the past six months and a book also recently released.<br />&nbsp; Dhivakar<br />--- On Fri, 30/5/08, SatishKumar Arunachalam &lt;satisharun@gmail.com&gt; wrote:</p>

<p>Venkatesh,</p>
<p>I have a question regarding Malik / tuqlaqs cakewalk across india.<br />Its next to impossible to get such a big army from outside India. Did<br />the locals were recruited in their army? even if the locals betrayed<br />their own kith and kin for money, how come they got in hand for<br />destroying the temples? Because there would have been surely some<br />revolts within the army if the temples were destroyed against their<br />wish...<br />I am wondering how pathetic our country was then, with in a few<br />hundred years of the 'Golden Era' of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym ..</p>
<p>kattabomman kathai mathir...mara thamizhar... veera tamizhar ellam<br />verum dubakoora???</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>
<p>&gt; <br />&gt; malik may have been the bad man. but he was the man with the highest <br />&gt; strike rate.<br />&gt; the one who never lost a battle!!!!<br />&gt; <br />&gt; venketesh<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</p>

<p>Hi actually put, there is no sole cause, but a collective failure. The deccan ruler aided n abetted malik ( to settle past scores) n they also knew that mallik's was at best a raid. So once he turned bk with his loot, they could pounce on the rich pastures of south. If only they had stood up, they could hv let mallik pass n corned him. Without logistic support n caught between opposing armies he would hv been surely perished. But there was never any unity amongst these despite all these talk of marital alliances etc. Mallik was able to individuall isolte each small ruler n in most cases the ruler surrendered or ran away. </p>
<p>So much for our legendary veeram ( the purananuru mother sword in hand whogoes to the battle field to check if her son indeed died of a wound in thebk as he turned to flee .. Pura muthugu kattinanan??? Claiming she would cut off the breast that suckled him if it were true, and as she saw her dead son killed from a front wound, despite her loss, she claims to have had the same joy as the day he was born)</p>
<p>Faced with a shrewd soldier, n a weak leadership ....minds corrupted by centuries of blind belief in rituals, they fell without even a token resistance.</p>

<p>Hi sps sir,</p>
<p>Coming to think of that n keeping in line with the current subject,...during nedumaran/mangaiyarkarasi persecution of jains in madurai, ( I hv the actual verse somewhere, will check n post) talks of jains being given a last choice ... Sport the shaivaite signs ( viboothi) n be spared. When the wholetown runs short of viboothi, they take cow products n smear upon themselves, when that too runs short, some even carry the calves of cows to escape. Lastly it makes fun of the people who couldn't find any of the above tryingto dash against the heads of people already sporting the signs. With due credits to the die hard jain followers, a considerable number voluntarily impales themselves on the stakes put up by the king ( so technically he didn't impale them) ..... It goes on saying such rotting bodies were consumed byvultures, dogs n foxs.......</p>
<p>Some 22000 are killed, that number is post above, so by extrapolating it, we get an idea of the extent of jain faith in that times, n how the works ofjust two saints ( appar n sambandar) n the two kings pallava n pandia could inflict such a death knell.</p>
<p>Faith...the most dangerous ( even today) sets man against man, brother against brother....gold, glory, god....</p>
<p>Rgds<br />Vj</p></sps10142004@...></p>

<blockquote><p>  Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  I have a question regarding Malik / tuqlaqs cakewalk across india.<br />  Its next to impossible to get such a big army from outside India. <br />Did<br />  the locals were recruited in their army? even if the locals <br />betrayed<br />  their own kith and kin for money, how come they got in hand for<br />  destroying the temples? Because there would have been surely some<br />  revolts within the army if the temples were destroyed against their<br />  wish...<br />  I am wondering how pathetic our country was then, with in a few<br />  hundred years of the 'Golden Era' of RRC and RJC..</p>

<p>Hi divakar sir,</p>
<p>Don't understand why you say above. He did exactly like what any other ambitious chieftain would do. The cholas were loosing ground n he capitalised. He was really talented ( penu senthamiz vazapirantha kadavan ....) , donated a lot, built temples , battled almost all the powers around him. Unfortunately they all ganged up against him. Even the chola he only imprisoned butdid not kill ....regarding letting northern sultans in he was not around when it happened. The sole cause of that debacle were our pandyas.</p>

<p>Hi Sps<br />simple<br />koperunchikan was a contemprory of cholas.<br />there were no cholas when malik came.<br />the second capital of the pandyas was in chola heart land kannanur( <br />samaya puram)<br />koperunchikan also built one gopuram of thillai. did extensive work <br />in the temple. </p>
<p>a lot of feudatories of the cholas must have had kalabra origin.<br />my opinion in the lack of absence of one fight to break the back bone <br />of the all powerful kalbras is that they slowly broke up and emerged <br />as mutharayar, sambuvarayars etc.</p>
<p>its amazing how one race that held tamil land in its claw like grip <br />could vanish without a trace.</p>

        <p>Vijay,<br />My favourite king also also Kopperunchinkan.&nbsp;Had he tried like Parantaka or Mahendra -&nbsp;he would have not allowed Northern Sultans in to South. leave it.<br />&nbsp; But Kopperunchinken was himself satisfied with the name of Kadava Chief. When he was ruling senthamangalam, it was under the control of Chola monarch.But his game - i.e, one upmanship, prevailed for very short time. If that happened, and succeeded in controlling Pandyas, Hoysala and also Chola, KC would have started another Pallava Empire and naming himself as Kopperunchinga Verman.<br />&nbsp; But he could not stop other kings called him as Kadava only and not pallava..<br />&nbsp; For Pallava and Kadava combination, i can show some present day examples.<br />Here in Andhra Pradesh, the rich Kamma caste people call themselves as Chowdhrys and lesser rich's or non-prominent but same caste people being calledas Kamma only. The system is prevailing even now also.<br />&nbsp; Also, the caste catagory was brought to South India, especially Tamilnadu, by Pallavas only atleast among calling themselves as Verma (Kshatriya) and later Pandyas copied this system. Even in Kshatriya caste in the present system also in Andhra Pradesh, this Vermas and Rajus are varies, though both are same. Verma goes with little higher grade than Raju.<br />&nbsp; And Kanchi those days of earlier Pallava, was very famous for education andego-clashes among educated elites. One Kadamba Sarma (By birth Brahmin) came to Kanchi to learn Vedha scripts but was not allowed because he was ruling a land and the Brahmins casted him that he became himself one step down,as Kshatriya only used to rule the land. The outraged Kadamba Sarma on thespot changed his name as Kadamba Verma and left with vengence from the place.<br />&nbsp; You can just give a thought, why not&nbsp; those days vermas call themselves as Pallavas and Raju's are Kadavas. One such Kadava could have ruled Thiruppaathiripuliyur.<br />&nbsp; Dear SPS,<br />Kalappirar or Kalabras were native karnatakas (Some claim they even belong to Southern Madhyapradesh)&nbsp;and I find there were no relation between Kadava and Kalabra atleast. Tamil Navalar Sarithai lights us little about Kalabhras but most of other Historians did not purchase this theory. Muththariayars came close to Kalabhras later.<br />&nbsp; Kadava, though a tribal outfit, the main&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallava Kings did not apply to themselves. But the other Kings like Chola or Pandya might have named them for long time. This is what I learn from Sekkizhar's calling pallava king as Kadava.<br />&nbsp; Thanks and Regards<br />Dhivakar</p>

<p>Hi sir,</p>
<p>My fav kadava - kopperunchingan ( divakar sir will not agree) - <br />question is what stopped him from taking the title of pallava - after <br />all the king could take whatever title he wanted. </p>

<blockquote><p>  ==================================================</p>
<p>  Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>  Kopperunchingan was post Malik Gafur. (1400 + AD)</p>
<p>  Kadavar, the Kalabra is prior / contemprary to Mahendra (600 AD) </p>
<p>  sps</p>
<p>hi sir</p></blockquote>
<p>dating of kopperunchinga accepted ( however some questions still <br />there if there were one or two - father son duo). further my <br />questions was kadava seems to be a more glorified name during the <br />early pallava days</p>
<p>Nandivarman Pallavamalla is praised as `one who was born to raise <br />the prestige of the Kadava family'<br />S.I.I., Vol. IV, p. 11, sec. D, 1. 1.</p>
<p>However, the pallava titles became popular later stage, but then why <br />didnt kopperunchinga take the title of pallava and still continued <br />with his kadava ensigns.</p>
<p>One of the titles of kopperunchingan found in inscriptions is <br />Kadavakula chudamani! </p>
<p>No. 120. (A. R. No. 286 of 1921).On the north and west walls of the <br />Muktisvara temple</p>
<p>another is Alagiyasiyan Avanialappirandan Kadavan Kopperunjingan </p>
<p>(what a title with due respects to siyan vikram!!)<br />(No. 119.<br />(A. R. No. 285 of 1921).<br />Attur, Chingleput Taluk and District.<br />On the north and west walls of the Muktisvara temple.</p>
<p>some more fancy titles of his </p>
<p>Sakalabhuvanachakravartti Kadavan Avanialappirandan Kopperunjinga</p>
<p>Bhupalanodbhava Kathakavamsa mauktika mani </p>
<p>No. 129.<br />(A. R. No. 229 of 1925).<br />Akkur, Mayavaram Taluk, Tanjore District.</p>
<p>On the east side of the base of the mandapa in front of the Tanto <br />Risvara temple.</p>
<p>This inscription states that Kopperunjingadeva who is called Alagiya-<br />Pallavar alias Virapratapar, after imprisoning the Hoysalas and <br />levying tribute from the Pandyas, proceeded to the Chola country <br />along the southern bank of the Kaveri</p>
<p>No. 128.<br />(A. R. No. 418 of 1922).<br />Vailur, Wandiwash Taluk, North Arcot District.</p>
<p>On a rock above a natural reservoir to the south of the village.</p>
<p>This inscription consists of 5 Tamil verses addressed to <br />Sakalabhuvanachakravarttin Kopperunjingadeva, surnamed Alagiyasiyan <br />who is said, in the preliminary prose passage, to have defeated the <br />Chola king at Tellaru and to have taken possession of his country <br />after depriving his adversary of all his royal insignia and <br />imprisoning him with his ministers. In the body of the record, <br />Kopperunjingadeva is called Avaninarayana, patron of Tamil, Kadava, <br />Tondaimannavan, Nripatunga, Tribhuvanatti-Rajakkal-Tambiran, <br />Mallaivendan, etc. The verses extol his prowess, fame, victory over <br />the Cholas, Pandyas and the Kannadas and his abiding devotion to the <br />god at Chidambaram.</p>

<p>Hi sir,</p>

<blockquote><p>  Venkatesh's above question is right. This was raised by many <br />scholars too. And most of Appar's incidents happened near present </p></blockquote>
<p>Cuddalore (Thiruppaathiripuliyur), where some Pallava's sibling may <br />have ruled that time. Sekkizhaar did mention that the culprit <br />was&nbsp;Kadava King but not name. If you go through the history, <br />most of Great Kings from Pallava dynasty wanted to name themselves <br />as Pallava and not Kadava, although Kadava too belong to the lineage <br />of Pallavas only. Mahendra's grand father Simhavarman's sibling <br />AiyadigaL Kadavarkon&nbsp; is one of the 63 Nayanmars. His songs are <br />included in&nbsp;9th Thirumurai.</p>
<blockquote><p>  &nbsp;   May we take like this?. Pallava means Chakravarthi who ruled from <br />Kanchi. And Kadava means Pallava clan but ruling some small part of </p></blockquote>
<p>Kingdoms under the control of Pallava. </p>
<blockquote><p>  &nbsp;   Samanam -&nbsp; came from the sanscritic word of sramanam even now <br />prevailed in some Parts of Karnataka Hills especially Indragiri </p></blockquote>
<p>(Sravanabelagola) and Chandragiri and mostly sponsored by Marvari <br />Jains. Presently Marvari Jains have their Jain Temples whereever <br />they present (urban cities-mainly).</p>
<blockquote><p>  &nbsp;   There was an interesting News on Marwari Jains told by none other <br />than Osho Rajneesh (who himself was a born Vysya-jain and Marwari </p></blockquote>
<p>jains are all Vysyas)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Jain faith started with <br />Kshatriya Kings due to the vengence fight&nbsp; versus Brahmin <br />Parasurama. All the Theerthankars were Kshatriyas and 24th Jeena, <br />Mahavira too, a born kshatriya. Osho said that Kshatriya Jains <br />wanted to reach the level of Ist varnam, i.e.&nbsp;Brahmin cultures <br />but declined slowly to the level of 3rd varnam, that is Vysyas now, <br />because&nbsp;purely 'ego' clashes formed&nbsp; the base of <br />religion.&nbsp;But Mahavir, as theerthankar shown the way of <br />relinquising everything to reach the higher world, but for name sake <br />this was taken but actionwise Mahavir was ignored. This was the <br />statement of Osho.</p>
<blockquote><p>  &nbsp;   Samanam or Jainism was all over Tamilnadu and Karnataka during 2nd <br />BC to 6 CE. No. doubt Jainism started from North. During Asoka's </p></blockquote>
<p>rule, the religion almost vanished in North (Ashoka, initially <br />belong to Jainism, according to Mr.AG.Gupta, Historian) and shifted <br />its base to&nbsp;Karnataka Hills. Almost by 2nd century CE&nbsp;the <br />jainism almost covered the entire region of Tamilnadu and Kings <br />patronised them. Though the jain monks who preaches on ethics of <br />goodlife and monks only contributed to the system and not others <br />including Kings. The system was good and instituion was started by <br />good intentional monks but later the religion was <br />completely&nbsp;taken over by selfish people. (you can refer songs <br />of Tevaram and Thivviabrabhandam - Thondaradip podi). </p>
<blockquote><p>  &nbsp;   Our guru used to say, any institution is destined to end. That was <br />seen in Jainism.<br />  &nbsp;   During this period, Bhuddhism was not prevailing in Tamilnadu-<br />Karnataka, mainly because of Samanam's strong holding over the </p></blockquote>
<p>place. But Bhuddist were strong in Central and Northern part of <br />Andhra Pradesh. The present Nagarjunasagar in Krishna riven in <br />central Andhra and the University there, were named after a Buddha <br />Muni, Nagarajuna Acharya, who by birth a brahmin, but embraced <br />Bhuddism and converted the Sadhavahana Kings into Bhuddism too. <br />Buddhist Monks established many mutts along the coromandal route <br />during that time. Again after sathavahanas (2nd BC to 0 CE), <br />bhuddism got vanished mainly due to Pallava kings patronising <br />Brahmins. Scores of copper plates were available in South Andhra on <br />such donations. (For instance, one Vishnugopa, who was defeated by <br />Samudhra Gupta during 330 CE (approx), when on his visit to Kovur <br />near Nellore,&nbsp; on the spot donated the whole village to a <br />brahmin for his service of spreading Vedha darmam through a copper</p>

<p>  &gt; Hi<br />  kalki seems to have taken for granted that the pallava and appar <br />were <br />  chums, after pallava converted.<br />  it is true that thiruvathigai played a huge role in both their <br />lives. <br />  but is debatable that they were very close.<br />  one pallavan did torture appar as is evident from his songs and <br />  sekkilar's account.<br />  who was that? mahendra or his predecessor.<br />  there is a prevalent theory that appar kept far away for kanchi <br />  except for one last visit. was he waiting for mahendra to die?<br />  from my inference of ss<br />  nedumaran and narasimha are almost of same age.<br />  in SS nedumaran is yet to marry mangaiyarkarasi and in a dream <br />  sequence kalki reveals that sambandha is yet to be born.<br />  since appar was quite active theologically when sambandar came of <br />age <br />  we presume appar out lived mahendra pallava by a huge margin.</p>
<p>  perhaps kalki used the author's liberty to show mahendra and appar <br />as <br />  close.<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>Ms. Marksia Gandhi - State Archlgy - Researcher - has written that <br />Thiruvadhigai was once the Capital of the part of Tamilnadu when <br />controlled during Portugese period (Parangipettai Surroundings !! )</p>
<p>This temple is situated on the banks of KAPILA RIVER ... and <br />supposed to be the BIRTH PLACE OF AYYANAR (@ Ayyappan ) !!</p>
<p>Parangipettai BABA Samadhi was much talked about during the filming <br />of BABA movie !!</p>
<p>In Thiruvadhigai, the erstwhile GUNAPARA (Jain) was became to be <br />known as MAHENDRA ! AND so he denoted Lord Siva in the Gunapara in <br />Lalithangusa Pallavagraham in Trichy Rock Fort.. </p>
<p>Parvathi hugged Siva fearing Siva may go behind Cauvery (like having <br />gone behind Ganges) seeing her beauty - exclaims Mahendra !!</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that when APPAR was tied to a Stone <br />and put in the Sea at MALLAI (Katrunaipootti Kadilil pottu), the <br />stone floated and Appar reached the Shore near Cuddalore <br />(KARAIYERIKUPPAM ). He hymed in nearby Pathiripuliyur Padaleeswarar <br />temple ! He recalled " Natrunaiyvathu NAMASIVAYAME ! "</p>
<p>Parangipettai - Karaiyerikuppam - Padhiripuliyur and Thiruvadhigai <br />are all nearby only - around Chidambaram !</p>
<p>anbudan / sps</p>

        <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;one pallavan did torture appar as is evident from his songsand <br />sekkilar's account.<br />who was that? mahendra or his predecessor.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &nbsp; Dear SPS,<br />&nbsp; Venkatesh's above question is right. This was raised by many scholars too. And most of Appar's incidents happened near present Cuddalore (Thiruppaathiripuliyur), where some Pallava's sibling may have ruled that time. Sekkizhaar did mention that the culprit was&nbsp;Kadava King but not name. If you go through the history, most of Great Kings from Pallava dynasty wanted to name themselves as Pallava and not Kadava, although Kadava too belong to thelineage of Pallavas only. Mahendra's grand father Simhavarman's sibling AiyadigaL Kadavarkon&nbsp; is one of the 63 Nayanmars. His songs are includedin&nbsp;9th Thirumurai.<br />&nbsp; May we take like this?. Pallava means Chakravarthi who ruled from Kanchi. And Kadava means Pallava clan but ruling some small part of Kingdoms under the control of Pallava. <br />&nbsp; Samanam -&nbsp; came from the sanscritic word of sramanam even now prevailed in some Parts of Karnataka Hills especially Indragiri (Sravanabelagola) and Chandragiri and mostly sponsored by Marvari Jains. Presently Marvari Jains have their Jain Temples whereever they present (urban cities-mainly).<br />&nbsp; There was an interesting News on Marwari Jains told by none other than OshoRajneesh (who himself was a born Vysya-jain and Marwari jains are all Vysyas)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Jain faith started with Kshatriya Kings due to the vengence fight&nbsp; versus Brahmin Parasurama. All the Theerthankars were Kshatriyas and 24th Jeena, Mahavira too, a born kshatriya. Osho said that Kshatriya Jains wanted to reach the level of Ist varnam, i.e.&nbsp;Brahmin cultures but declined slowly to the level of 3rd varnam, that is Vysyas now,because&nbsp;purely 'ego' clashes formed&nbsp; the base of religion.&nbsp;But Mahavir, as theerthankar shown the way of relinquising everything to reach the higher world, but for name sake this was taken but actionwise Mahavir was ignored. This was the statement of Osho.<br />&nbsp; Samanam or Jainism was all over Tamilnadu and Karnataka during 2nd BC to 6 CE. No. doubt Jainism started from North. During Asoka's rule, the religionalmost vanished in North (Ashoka, initially belong to Jainism, according to Mr.AG.Gupta, Historian) and shifted its base to&nbsp;Karnataka Hills. Almost by 2nd century CE&nbsp;the jainism almost covered the entire region of Tamilnadu and Kings patronised them. Though the jain monks who preaches on ethics of goodlife and monks only contributed to the system and not others including Kings. The system was good and instituion was started by good intentional monks but later the religion was completely&nbsp;taken over by selfish people. (you can refer songs of Tevaram and Thivviabrabhandam - Thondaradip podi). <br />&nbsp; Our guru used to say, any institution is destined to end. That was seen in Jainism.<br />&nbsp; During this period, Bhuddhism was not prevailing in Tamilnadu-Karnataka, mainly because of Samanam's strong holding over the place. But Bhuddist were strong in Central and Northern part of Andhra Pradesh. The present Nagarjunasagar in Krishna riven in central Andhra and the University there, were named after a Buddha Muni, Nagarajuna Acharya, who by birth a brahmin, but embraced Bhuddism and converted the Sadhavahana Kings into Bhuddism too. Buddhist Monks established many mutts along the coromandal route during that time. Again after sathavahanas (2nd BC to 0 CE), bhuddism got vanished mainlydue to Pallava kings patronising Brahmins. Scores of copper plates were available in South Andhra on such donations. (For instance, one Vishnugopa, who was defeated by Samudhra Gupta during 330 CE (approx), when on his visitto Kovur near Nellore,&nbsp; on the spot donated the whole village to a brahmin for his service of spreading Vedha darmam through a copper<br />plate)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Dhivakar</p>

Appar's trials and <br />&gt; tribulations resulted in the Mahendra pallavan converting back to <br />&gt; Saivism but not in large scale conversion or torture of <br />&gt; Jain/Buddhists.

<p>Dear venkat</p>
<p>you say one pallavan instead of mahendra</p>
<p>Lets look at the facts:</p>
<p>1. appar's conversion from jainism is well established. so we dont <br />go into that</p>
<p>2. that he was tortured by a pallava is also well established. Every <br />one of appars's initial verses talk of this. infact appar's frequent <br />reference to the humbling of ravana ( by shiva - ravana shaking <br />mount kailash) is suggestive of his digs at the king's exhalted ego <br />and how it would be humbled by shiva.</p>
<p>3. from below its clear that based on appar's advise the pallava <br />king destroyed jain establishments and built hindu temples</p>

<p>the direct reference to one of mahendra's titles as gunabaran is a <br />def pointer.</p>
<p>4. We know from mahendra's work Mattavilasa Prahasana - ( mappula <br />vilaiyattu - crudely in tamil !!) is such a satire on Buddhism and <br />the Kapalika/ Pasupata sects of Saivism. There is a passage in the <br />play when mahendra exalts the jain method of attaining salvation - <br />their non violent methods, abstention from drinks/meat etc.</p>
<p>5. from mahendra's trichy cave - Lalitankura-Pallavesvara-grham <br />verse we know for certain that he converted to worship shiva from a <br />hostile faith!!</p>
<p>to read more please refer below</p>

<p>According to Sekkilar, a 12th century poet, the Saivite saint Appar, <br />also known as Tirunavukkarasu, was a contemporary of a Pallava <br />monarch whom he converted to Saivism. All evidences point to the <br />fact that Appar lived in the 7th Century CE. Mahendra I, Narasimha <br />I, Mahendra II and Paramesvaravarman I were the Pallava monarchs who <br />ruled in the 7th Century CE. </p>
<p>It is only in the Trichy inscription of Mahendra I, we have a <br />positive reference to his conversion to Saivism from some other <br />faith, while the inscriptions of other monarchs portray them as <br />great Saivites. Thus we have both epigraphical and literary <br />references, pointing to the contemporaneity of Saint Appar and <br />Mahendra. <br />This is further substantiated by other evidences. <br />In many of his verses, Appar mentions the worship of Siva in the <br />form of linga.(inkurren enru lingatte tonrinanai) (lingapuranttu <br />ullanai) <br />It is therefore evident, that the worship of Siva in the form of <br />Linga was well established long before the time of Appar and <br />Mahendra. <br />Thus the second verse of Mahendra, at Tiruchirapalli, is of historic <br />interest. It refers to the conversion of Mahendra to Saivism.</p>
<p>The verse under discussion reads as follows: </p>
<p>Gunabhara-namani raja- nyanena lingena lingini jnanam Prathatam <br />ciraya loke vipaksavrtteh paravrttam </p>
<p>See the refererence to the king as gunabara ( also a title of shiva)</p>
<p>The first meaning of the verse is as follows: anena lingena: Through <br />the Sivalinga (established) here. Gunabhara-namani rajani: in the <br />king named Gunabhara, lingini: who bears the Linga (i.e. constantly <br />adores Siva) jnanam: the knowledge vipakshavretteh paravrttam: that <br />he has turned away from the hostile faith loke chiraya prathatam: <br />let it become well known in the world for long. <br />There is a clear reference here to Mahendra's conversion, from <br />Jainism to Saivism in the words Vipakshavrtteh paravrttam. There is <br />also an unequivocal reference to the worship of Sivalinga in the <br />terms Linga and Lingin, Lingin meaning one who bears the Linga, i.e. <br />worships Linga. <br />The second meaning of the verse will become evident when it is <br />understood in terms of the process of inference, (1. Inferential <br />cognition is accepted as a valid cognition by all systems of Indian <br />philosophy. A syllogism employed in this process of cognition <br />comprises the following elements: <br />(1) Hetu or Linga or the probans or the reason or the middle term <br />e.g. smoke (2) Sadhya or Lingin the probandum or major term which is <br />to be established, e.g. fire. (3) Paksha the subject in which the <br />probandum is not known and is to be proved, e.g. a mountain as <br />having fire when smoke which is noticed is relied upon as the <br />probans. (4) Sapaksha a similar instance in which the probandum is <br />known for certain, e.g. hearth where smoke and fire had been seen <br />together invariably. (5) Vipaksha a counter example in which the non-<br />existence of the probandum is known for certain e.g., a tank where <br />neither fire nor its concomittant smoke is known) The elements of <br />the inference are stated here in the terminology of prachina <br />(ancient) nyaya and not of modern logic. According to Gautama, the <br />author of the Nyaya sutras, the first limb of a syllogism, the <br />statement of the thesis called Pratijna is given as Sadhya-nidresa <br />and this includes the minor and major term. (1. See also <br />Mudrarakshasa Nataka, V. 10 Sadhye nischitam etc.) The invariable <br />relation between the Linga or probans or middle term, in this case <br />between the Sivalinga established by the King in that temple, and <br />the Lingin, the major term, viz., the knowledge of Siva as existing <br />in the King (the paksha or minor term) should be free from any flaw; <br />one of the flaws which would vitiate the inference is the presence <br />of this in a counter-example; i.e., it should be vipaksha-vyavrtta; <br />in the present case, this Sivalinga and knowledge and devotion to <br />the same are absent from Jainism. (2. I am thankful to my Professor, <br />Dr. Raghavan, for clarifying the meaning of the verse, on the side <br />of logic.)  </p>

<p>    Hi Vijay/Vairam,<br />    Are we confusing too many legends into one? Sambandar episode is <br />  the one where jain monks are impaled at the end of it, that too by <br />  the Koon pandiyan and his queen mangayarkarasi. Appar's trials and <br />  tribulations resulted in the Mahendra pallavan converting back to <br />  Saivism but not in large scale conversion or torture of <br />  Jain/Buddhists. Also my theory would be that since Pulikesi could <br />  have support of jains, mahendra pallavan could have converted to <br />  saivism to garner more support from the traditional saivite country <br />  of southern tamilnadu.<br />    Regards<br />    Nanda</p>

<p>      Probably the base to such legend would have been the Saiva,Jain<br />      ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar threw some <br />  poetry <br />    on<br />      palm leaves into the river...to see which one came back to <br />shore <br />  and<br />      which left to prove the religions supremacy...</p>
<p>    Hi vairam</p>
<p>    The legend is appar engaged jains in a debate in front of <br />mahendra <br />    pallava. the test was not floating palm leaves on water but a <br />test <br />  of <br />    fire...</p>
<p>    This happens after appar's reconversion back ( born as marul <br />    neeikiyaar - into jain faith as dharmasenar and then into the <br />  shivaite <br />    faith as tiru navukkarasar ...fondly called as appar by gyana <br />    sambandar) - the king himself into the jain faith, was goaded by <br />  the <br />    jain monks fearing the retribution of a popular jain monk <br />  embracing <br />    shivism...led the king to subject appar to many tortures - incl <br />  being <br />    confined into a cell for a week without food or water, being <br />  poisoned, <br />    trying be crushed under an elephants foot and then finally being <br />  tied <br />    to a stone and dropped into the sea....( dont want to take the <br />    comparison to the dasavataram again)....appar emerged unscathed <br />  which <br />    sowed seeds of doubt into the kings mind... each of these <br />episodes <br />  are <br />    beautifully sung in tamil verse by appar ( its not for nothing <br />  that he <br />    is called navukkuarasar - the king of the tongue)</p>
<p>    inorder to clear the doubt about which faith was stronger <br />mahendra <br />    engaged appar with a debate with the jain monks...both argued for <br />  long <br />    without any clear winner emerging...finally they agreed to a <br />    test...wherein each wrote a verse in palm leaf and threw it into <br />a <br />    fire.....appar' s emerged unscathed but the jain work <br />  perished...this <br />    made mahendra convert back to shivism ....and not much publisised <br />  but <br />    has to be admitted - a brutal attack at wiping out the jain faith <br />  in <br />    tamil land...which included impaling them on stakes ( kazuvil <br />    ettruthal), mass murder - leaving their bodies to be consumed by <br />  dogs <br />    and foxs...etc. all these are also sung...the king also destroyed <br />  a <br />    large number of jain schools and places of worship </p>
<p>    this is a very significant and turning point in tamil land, if <br />not <br />  for <br />    this - i would have had to sign off as vijay jain.....</p>
