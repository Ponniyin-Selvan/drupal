<p>Kodumbalur : This place, also known as Muvarkoil is 36 kms. from Pudukkottai and 42 kms. from Trichy. It was formerly the seat of Irukkavelirs who were related to Cholas. </p>
<p>Out of the three shrines of Muvarkoil, only two exist now. These temples were built by Budhi Viramakesan in the 10th century A.D. The architecture of this temple is unique among the South Indian temples. The sculptures of Kalarimurthi, Gajasamharamurthi, Ardhanari and Gangadara-murthi etc. are interesting masterpieces of art. Nearby is the Muchukundeswarar temple of the early Chola period. </p>
<p>Viralimalai : This town lies north-west of Pudukkottai about 40 kms.

<p>You have made a very good account on evolution of Temple architecture in <br />the Indian subcontinent. However, one can see the transformation of dynastical style of South indian temples at the following archaeological sites</p>
<p>namely 1. Sreenivasanallur, 2.Vijayalaya choleeswaram at Narthamalai.</p>
<p>GSK </p>
<p>"s.balasubramani" <kalinga_tamil@yahoo.co.in  wrote:<br />A Brief History of Hindu Temples</kalinga_tamil@yahoo.co.in></p>
<p>How and when the first temple took its birth is anybody's guess. <br />Temples do not seem to have existed during the Vedic age. </p>
<p>The practice of preparing images of the deities mentioned in the <br />Vedic mantras might have come into vogue by the end of the Vedic <br />period. The view that the yagasala of the Vedic period gradually got <br />metamorphosed into temples by the epic period owing to the influence <br />of the cults of devotion is widely accepted.</p>
<p>The earliest temples were built with perishable materials like timber <br />and clay. Cave-temples, temples carved out of the stone or built with <br />bricks came later. Heavy stone structures with ornate architecture <br />and sculpture belong to a still later period.</p>
<p>Considering the vast size of this country, is is remarkable that the <br />building of temple has progressed more or less on a set pattern. This <br />is because there is a basic philosophy behind the temple, its meaning <br />and significance, which will be explained later.</p>
<p>In spite of the basic pattern being the same, varieties did appear, <br />gradually leading to the evolution of different styles in temple <br />architecture. Broadly speaking, these can be bifurcated into the <br />northern and the southern styles. </p>
<p>The northern style, technically called nagara, is distinguished by <br />the curvilinear towers. </p>
<p>The southern style, known as the dravida, has its towers in the form <br />of truncated pyramids. A third style, vesara by name, is sometimes <br />added, which combines in itself both these styles.</p>
<p>The earliest temples in north and central India which have withstood <br />the vagaries of time belong to the Gupta period, 320-650 A. D. <br />Mention may be meda of the temples at Sanchi, Tigawa (near Jabbalpur <br />in Madhya Pradesh), Bhumara (in Madhya Pradesh), Nachna (Rajasthan) <br />and Deogarh (near Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh).</p>
<p>Among the earliest surviving temples in South India are found in <br />Tamil Nadu and northern Karnataka. The cradle of Dravidan school of <br />architecture was the Tamil country which evolved from the earliest <br />Buddhist shrines which were both rock-cut and structural. </p>
<p>The later rock-cut temples which belong roughly to the period 500-800 <br />A.D. were mostly Brahmanical or Jain, patronised by three great <br />ruling dynasties of the south, namely the Pallavas of Kanchi in the <br />east, the Calukyas of Badami in the 8th century A.D, the Rastrakutas <br />of Malkhed came to power and they made great contributions to the <br />development of south Indian temple architecture. The Kailasanatha <br />temple at Ellora belongs to this period.</p>
<p>In the west (northern Karnataka) the Aihole and Pattadakal group of <br />temples (5th to 7th centuries) show early attempts to evolve an <br />acceptable regional style based on tradition. </p>
<p>Among the better known early structural temples at Aihole are the <br />Huchimalligudi and Durga temples as also the Ladkhan temple, all <br />assigned to the period 450-650 A.D. Equally important are the temples <br />of Kasinatha, Papanatha, Sangamesvara, Virupaksa and others in <br />Pattadakal near Aihole as also the Svargabrahma temple at Alampur <br />(Andhra Pradesh). </p>
<p>It is in some of these temples, built by the later Calukyas, that we <br />come across the vesara style, a combination of the northern and the <br />southern modes.</p>
<p>There are many ancient texts laying down the formal architectural <br />styles prevalent in the various regions so that the comprehensive <br />text called the Vastu Sastra has its sources in the Sutras, Puranas <br />and Agamas besides Tantric literature and the Brhat Samhita. </p>
<p>But all of them are agreed that basically styles can be divided into <br />nagara, dravida and vesara. They employ respectively the square, <br />octagon and the apse or circle in their plan. In its later evolution <br />when the vesara style adopted the square for the sanctum. The <br />circular or stellar plan was retained for the vimana. </p>
<p>These three styles do not pertain strictly to three different regions <br />but as indicating only the temple groups. The vesara, for instance, <br />which came to pravail mostly in western Deccan and south Karnataka <br />was a derivation from the apsidal chapels of the early Buddhist <br />period which the Brahmanical faith adopted and vastly improved. In <br />its origin, the vesara is as much north Indian as it is west <br />Deccanese. </p>
<p>Similarly among the 6th &#150; 7th century shrines of Aihole and <br />Pattadakal we find evidance of nagara style in the prasadas or <br />vimanas. </p>
<p>The dravida or Tamilian style cecame very popular throughout south <br />India only from the Vijayanagar times onward. While the prasada or <br />vimana of the nagara style rises vertically from its base in a <br />curvilinear form, that of the dravida rises like a stepped pyramid, <br />tier upon tier. The northern style came to prevail in Rajasthan Upper <br />India, Orissa, the Vindhyan uplands and Gujarat.</p>
<p>During the next thousand years (from600 to 1600 A.D.) there was a <br />phenomenal growth in temple architecture both in quantity and <br />quality. </p>
<p>The first in the series of southern or dravidian architecture was <br />initiated by the Pallavas (600-900A.D.) The rock-cut temples at <br />Mahabalipuram (of the `ratha' type) and the structural temples like <br />the shore temple at Mahabalipuram and the Kailasanatha and Vaikuntha <br />Perumal temples in Kancheepuram (700-800 A.D.) are the best <br />representatives of the Pallava style. </p>
<p>The Pallavas laid the foundations of the dravidian school which <br />blossomed to its full extent during the Colas, the Pandyas, the <br />Vijayanagar kings and the Nayaks. </p>
<p>The temples, now built of stone, became bigger, more complex and <br />ornate with sculptures. Dravidian architecture reached its glory <br />during the Chola period (900-1200 A.D.) by becoming more imposing in <br />size and endowed with happy proportions. </p>
<p>Among the most beautiful of the Chola temples is the Brhadisvara <br />temple at Tanjore with its 66 metre high vimana, the tallest of its <br />kind. The later Pandyans who succeeded the Cholas improved on the <br />Cholas by introducing elaborate ornamentation and big sculptural <br />images, many-pillared halls, new annexes to the shrine and towers <br />(gopurams) on the gateways. </p>
<p>The mighty temple complexes of Madurai and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu <br />set a pattern for the Vijayanagar builders (1350-1565 A.D.) who <br />followed the dravidian tradition. The Pampapati and Vitthala temples <br />in Hampi are standing examples of this period. The Nayaks of Madurai <br />who succeeded the Vijayanagar kings (1600-1750 A.D.) made the <br />dravidian temple complex even more elaborate by making the gopurams <br />very tall and ornate and adding pillared corridors within the temple <br />long compound.</p>
<p>Contemporaneous with the Cholas (1100-1300A.D.), the Hoysalas who <br />ruled the Kannada country improved on the Calukyan style by building <br />extremely ornate temples in many parts of Karnataka noted for the <br />sculptures in the walls, depressed ceilings, lathe-turned pillars and <br />fully sculptured vimanas. Among the most famous of these temples are <br />the ones at Belur, Halebid and Somanathapura in south Karnataka, <br />which are classified under the vesara style.</p>
<p>In the north, the chief developments in Hindu temple architecture <br />took place in Orissa (750-1250 A.D.) and Central India (950-1050 <br />A.D.) as also Rajasthan (10th and 11th Century A.D.) and Gujarat <br />(11th-13th Century A.D.). </p>
<p>The temples of Lingaraja (Bhubaneshwar), Jagannatha (Puri) and Surya <br />(Konarak) represent the Orissan style. The temple at Khajuraho built <br />by the Chandellas, the Surya temple at Modhera (Gujarat0 and other <br />temple at Mt. Abu built by the Solankis have their own distinct <br />features in Central indian architecture. Bengal with its temples <br />built in bricks and terracotta tiles and Kerala with its temples <br />having peculiar roof structure suited to the heavy rainfall of the <br />region, developed their own localised special styles.</p>
<p>Mention may also be made here of the various Hindu temples outside <br />India, especially in the South East Asian countries. The earliest of <br />such Hindu temples are found in Java; for instance, the Siva temples <br />at Dieng and (idong Songo built by the kings of Sailendra dynasty <br />(8th-9th century A.D.). </p>
<p>The group of temples of Lara Jonggrang at Pranbanan (9th or 10th <br />century A.D.), is a magnificent example of Hindu temple architecture. <br />Other temples worth mentioning are: the temple complex at Panataran <br />(java) built by the kings of Majapahit dynasty (14th century A.D.), <br />the rock-cut temple facades at Tampaksiring of Bali (11th century <br />A.D.), the 'mother' temple at Besakh of Bali (14th century A.D.), the <br />Chen La temples at Sambor Prei Kuk in Cambodia (7th-8th century <br />A.D.)., the temple of Banteay Srei at Angkor (10th century A.D.) and <br />the celebrated Angkor vat complex (12th century A.D.) built by Surya <br />varman II.</p>

<p>  "s.balasubramani" <kalinga_tamil@...  wrote:<br />  A Brief History of Hindu Temples</kalinga_tamil@...></p>
<p>  How and when the first temple took its birth is anybody's guess. <br />  Temples do not seem to have existed during the Vedic age. </p>
<p>  The practice of preparing images of the deities mentioned in the <br />  Vedic mantras might have come into vogue by the end of the Vedic <br />  period. The view that the yagasala of the Vedic period gradually <br />got <br />  metamorphosed into temples by the epic period owing to the <br />influence <br />  of the cults of devotion is widely accepted.</p>
<p>  The earliest temples were built with perishable materials like <br />timber <br />  and clay. Cave-temples, temples carved out of the stone or built <br />with <br />  bricks came later. Heavy stone structures with ornate architecture <br />  and sculpture belong to a still later period.</p>
<p>  Considering the vast size of this country, is is remarkable that <br />the <br />  building of temple has progressed more or less on a set pattern. <br />This <br />  is because there is a basic philosophy behind the temple, its <br />meaning <br />  and significance, which will be explained later.</p>
<p>  In spite of the basic pattern being the same, varieties did <br />appear, <br />  gradually leading to the evolution of different styles in temple <br />  architecture. Broadly speaking, these can be bifurcated into the <br />  northern and the southern styles. </p>
<p>  The northern style, technically called nagara, is distinguished by <br />  the curvilinear towers. </p>
<p>  The southern style, known as the dravida, has its towers in the <br />form <br />  of truncated pyramids. A third style, vesara by name, is sometimes <br />  added, which combines in itself both these styles.</p>
<p>  The earliest temples in north and central India which have <br />withstood <br />  the vagaries of time belong to the Gupta period, 320-650 A. D. <br />  Mention may be meda of the temples at Sanchi, Tigawa (near <br />Jabbalpur <br />  in Madhya Pradesh), Bhumara (in Madhya Pradesh), Nachna <br />(Rajasthan) <br />  and Deogarh (near Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh).</p>
<p>  Among the earliest surviving temples in South India are found in <br />  Tamil Nadu and northern Karnataka. The cradle of Dravidan school <br />of <br />  architecture was the Tamil country which evolved from the earliest <br />  Buddhist shrines which were both rock-cut and structural. </p>
<p>  The later rock-cut temples which belong roughly to the period 500-<br />800 <br />  A.D. were mostly Brahmanical or Jain, patronised by three great <br />  ruling dynasties of the south, namely the Pallavas of Kanchi in <br />the <br />  east, the Calukyas of Badami in the 8th century A.D, the <br />Rastrakutas <br />  of Malkhed came to power and they made great contributions to the <br />  development of south Indian temple architecture. The Kailasanatha <br />  temple at Ellora belongs to this period.</p>
<p>  In the west (northern Karnataka) the Aihole and Pattadakal group <br />of <br />  temples (5th to 7th centuries) show early attempts to evolve an <br />  acceptable regional style based on tradition. </p>
<p>  Among the better known early structural temples at Aihole are the <br />  Huchimalligudi and Durga temples as also the Ladkhan temple, all <br />  assigned to the period 450-650 A.D. Equally important are the <br />temples <br />  of Kasinatha, Papanatha, Sangamesvara, Virupaksa and others in <br />  Pattadakal near Aihole as also the Svargabrahma temple at Alampur <br />  (Andhra Pradesh). </p>
<p>  It is in some of these temples, built by the later Calukyas, that <br />we <br />  come across the vesara style, a combination of the northern and <br />the <br />  southern modes.</p>
<p>  There are many ancient texts laying down the formal architectural <br />  styles prevalent in the various regions so that the comprehensive <br />  text called the Vastu Sastra has its sources in the Sutras, <br />Puranas <br />  and Agamas besides Tantric literature and the Brhat Samhita. </p>
<p>  But all of them are agreed that basically styles can be divided <br />into <br />  nagara, dravida and vesara. They employ respectively the square, <br />  octagon and the apse or circle in their plan. In its later <br />evolution <br />  when the vesara style adopted the square for the sanctum. The <br />  circular or stellar plan was retained for the vimana. </p>
<p>  These three styles do not pertain strictly to three different <br />regions <br />  but as indicating only the temple groups. The vesara, for <br />instance, <br />  which came to pravail mostly in western Deccan and south Karnataka <br />  was a derivation from the apsidal chapels of the early Buddhist <br />  period which the Brahmanical faith adopted and vastly improved. In <br />  its origin, the vesara is as much north Indian as it is west <br />  Deccanese. </p>
<p>  Similarly among the 6th ? 7th century shrines of Aihole and <br />  Pattadakal we find evidance of nagara style in the prasadas or <br />  vimanas. </p>
<p>  The dravida or Tamilian style cecame very popular throughout south <br />  India only from the Vijayanagar times onward. While the prasada or <br />  vimana of the nagara style rises vertically from its base in a <br />  curvilinear form, that of the dravida rises like a stepped <br />pyramid, <br />  tier upon tier. The northern style came to prevail in Rajasthan <br />Upper <br />  India, Orissa, the Vindhyan uplands and Gujarat.</p>
<p>  During the next thousand years (from600 to 1600 A.D.) there was a <br />  phenomenal growth in temple architecture both in quantity and <br />  quality. </p>
<p>  The first in the series of southern or dravidian architecture was <br />  initiated by the Pallavas (600-900A.D.) The rock-cut temples at <br />  Mahabalipuram (of the `ratha' type) and the structural temples <br />like <br />  the shore temple at Mahabalipuram and the Kailasanatha and <br />Vaikuntha <br />  Perumal temples in Kancheepuram (700-800 A.D.) are the best <br />  representatives of the Pallava style. </p>
<p>  The Pallavas laid the foundations of the dravidian school which <br />  blossomed to its full extent during the Colas, the Pandyas, the <br />  Vijayanagar kings and the Nayaks. </p>
<p>  The temples, now built of stone, became bigger, more complex and <br />  ornate with sculptures. Dravidian architecture reached its glory <br />  during the Chola period (900-1200 A.D.) by becoming more imposing <br />in <br />  size and endowed with happy proportions. </p>
<p>  Among the most beautiful of the Chola temples is the Brhadisvara <br />  temple at Tanjore with its 66 metre high vimana, the tallest of <br />its <br />  kind. The later Pandyans who succeeded the Cholas improved on the <br />  Cholas by introducing elaborate ornamentation and big sculptural <br />  images, many-pillared halls, new annexes to the shrine and towers <br />  (gopurams) on the gateways. </p>
<p>  The mighty temple complexes of Madurai and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu <br />  set a pattern for the Vijayanagar builders (1350-1565 A.D.) who <br />  followed the dravidian tradition. The Pampapati and Vitthala <br />temples <br />  in Hampi are standing examples of this period. The Nayaks of <br />Madurai <br />  who succeeded the Vijayanagar kings (1600-1750 A.D.) made the <br />  dravidian temple complex even more elaborate by making the <br />gopurams <br />  very tall and ornate and adding pillared corridors within the <br />temple <br />  long compound.</p>
<p>  Contemporaneous with the Cholas (1100-1300A.D.), the Hoysalas who <br />  ruled the Kannada country improved on the Calukyan style by <br />building <br />  extremely ornate temples in many parts of Karnataka noted for the <br />  sculptures in the walls, depressed ceilings, lathe-turned pillars <br />and <br />  fully sculptured vimanas. Among the most famous of these temples <br />are <br />  the ones at Belur, Halebid and Somanathapura in south Karnataka, <br />  which are classified under the vesara style.</p>
<p>  In the north, the chief developments in Hindu temple architecture <br />  took place in Orissa (750-1250 A.D.) and Central India (950-1050 <br />  A.D.) as also Rajasthan (10th and 11th Century A.D.) and Gujarat <br />  (11th-13th Century A.D.). </p>
<p>  The temples of Lingaraja (Bhubaneshwar), Jagannatha (Puri) and <br />Surya <br />  (Konarak) represent the Orissan style. The temple at Khajuraho <br />built <br />  by the Chandellas, the Surya temple at Modhera (Gujarat0 and other <br />  temple at Mt. Abu built by the Solankis have their own distinct <br />  features in Central indian architecture. Bengal with its temples <br />  built in bricks and terracotta tiles and Kerala with its temples <br />  having peculiar roof structure suited to the heavy rainfall of the <br />  region, developed their own localised special styles.</p>
<p>  Mention may also be made here of the various Hindu temples outside <br />  India, especially in the South East Asian countries. The earliest <br />of <br />  such Hindu temples are found in Java; for instance, the Siva <br />temples <br />  at Dieng and (idong Songo built by the kings of Sailendra dynasty <br />  (8th-9th century A.D.). </p>
<p>  The group of temples of Lara Jonggrang at Pranbanan (9th or 10th <br />  century A.D.), is a magnificent example of Hindu temple <br />architecture. <br />  Other temples worth mentioning are: the temple complex at <br />Panataran <br />  (java) built by the kings of Majapahit dynasty (14th century <br />A.D.), <br />  the rock-cut temple facades at Tampaksiring of Bali (11th century <br />  A.D.), the 'mother' temple at Besakh of Bali (14th century A.D.), <br />the <br />  Chen La temples at Sambor Prei Kuk in Cambodia (7th-8th century <br />  A.D.)., the temple of Banteay Srei at Angkor (10th century A.D.) <br />and <br />  the celebrated Angkor vat complex (12th century A.D.) built by <br />Surya <br />  varman II.</p>

<p>  "s.balasubramani" <kalinga_tamil@...  wrote:<br />  A Brief History of Hindu Temples</kalinga_tamil@...></p>
<p>  How and when the first temple took its birth is anybody's guess. <br />  Temples do not seem to have existed during the Vedic age. </p>
<p>  The practice of preparing images of the deities mentioned in the <br />  Vedic mantras might have come into vogue by the end of the Vedic <br />  period. The view that the yagasala of the Vedic period gradually got <br />  metamorphosed into temples by the epic period owing to the influence <br />  of the cults of devotion is widely accepted.</p>
<p>  The earliest temples were built with perishable materials like <br />timber <br />  and clay. Cave-temples, temples carved out of the stone or built <br />with <br />  bricks came later. Heavy stone structures with ornate architecture <br />  and sculpture belong to a still later period.</p>
<p>  Considering the vast size of this country, is is remarkable that the <br />  building of temple has progressed more or less on a set pattern. <br />This <br />  is because there is a basic philosophy behind the temple, its <br />meaning <br />  and significance, which will be explained later.</p>
<p>  In spite of the basic pattern being the same, varieties did appear, <br />  gradually leading to the evolution of different styles in temple <br />  architecture. Broadly speaking, these can be bifurcated into the <br />  northern and the southern styles. </p>
<p>  The northern style, technically called nagara, is distinguished by <br />  the curvilinear towers. </p>
<p>  The southern style, known as the dravida, has its towers in the form <br />  of truncated pyramids. A third style, vesara by name, is sometimes <br />  added, which combines in itself both these styles.</p>
<p>  The earliest temples in north and central India which have withstood <br />  the vagaries of time belong to the Gupta period, 320-650 A. D. <br />  Mention may be meda of the temples at Sanchi, Tigawa (near Jabbalpur <br />  in Madhya Pradesh), Bhumara (in Madhya Pradesh), Nachna (Rajasthan) <br />  and Deogarh (near Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh).</p>
<p>  Among the earliest surviving temples in South India are found in <br />  Tamil Nadu and northern Karnataka. The cradle of Dravidan school of <br />  architecture was the Tamil country which evolved from the earliest <br />  Buddhist shrines which were both rock-cut and structural. </p>
<p>  The later rock-cut temples which belong roughly to the period 500-<br />800 <br />  A.D. were mostly Brahmanical or Jain, patronised by three great <br />  ruling dynasties of the south, namely the Pallavas of Kanchi in the <br />  east, the Calukyas of Badami in the 8th century A.D, the Rastrakutas <br />  of Malkhed came to power and they made great contributions to the <br />  development of south Indian temple architecture. The Kailasanatha <br />  temple at Ellora belongs to this period.</p>
<p>  In the west (northern Karnataka) the Aihole and Pattadakal group of <br />  temples (5th to 7th centuries) show early attempts to evolve an <br />  acceptable regional style based on tradition. </p>
<p>  Among the better known early structural temples at Aihole are the <br />  Huchimalligudi and Durga temples as also the Ladkhan temple, all <br />  assigned to the period 450-650 A.D. Equally important are the <br />temples <br />  of Kasinatha, Papanatha, Sangamesvara, Virupaksa and others in <br />  Pattadakal near Aihole as also the Svargabrahma temple at Alampur <br />  (Andhra Pradesh). </p>
<p>  It is in some of these temples, built by the later Calukyas, that we <br />  come across the vesara style, a combination of the northern and the <br />  southern modes.</p>
<p>  There are many ancient texts laying down the formal architectural <br />  styles prevalent in the various regions so that the comprehensive <br />  text called the Vastu Sastra has its sources in the Sutras, Puranas <br />  and Agamas besides Tantric literature and the Brhat Samhita. </p>
<p>  But all of them are agreed that basically styles can be divided into <br />  nagara, dravida and vesara. They employ respectively the square, <br />  octagon and the apse or circle in their plan. In its later evolution <br />  when the vesara style adopted the square for the sanctum. The <br />  circular or stellar plan was retained for the vimana. </p>
<p>  These three styles do not pertain strictly to three different <br />regions <br />  but as indicating only the temple groups. The vesara, for instance, <br />  which came to pravail mostly in western Deccan and south Karnataka <br />  was a derivation from the apsidal chapels of the early Buddhist <br />  period which the Brahmanical faith adopted and vastly improved. In <br />  its origin, the vesara is as much north Indian as it is west <br />  Deccanese. </p>
<p>  Similarly among the 6th ? 7th century shrines of Aihole and <br />  Pattadakal we find evidance of nagara style in the prasadas or <br />  vimanas. </p>
<p>  The dravida or Tamilian style cecame very popular throughout south <br />  India only from the Vijayanagar times onward. While the prasada or <br />  vimana of the nagara style rises vertically from its base in a <br />  curvilinear form, that of the dravida rises like a stepped pyramid, <br />  tier upon tier. The northern style came to prevail in Rajasthan <br />Upper <br />  India, Orissa, the Vindhyan uplands and Gujarat.</p>
<p>  During the next thousand years (from600 to 1600 A.D.) there was a <br />  phenomenal growth in temple architecture both in quantity and <br />  quality. </p>
<p>  The first in the series of southern or dravidian architecture was <br />  initiated by the Pallavas (600-900A.D.) The rock-cut temples at <br />  Mahabalipuram (of the `ratha' type) and the structural temples like <br />  the shore temple at Mahabalipuram and the Kailasanatha and Vaikuntha <br />  Perumal temples in Kancheepuram (700-800 A.D.) are the best <br />  representatives of the Pallava style. </p>
<p>  The Pallavas laid the foundations of the dravidian school which <br />  blossomed to its full extent during the Colas, the Pandyas, the <br />  Vijayanagar kings and the Nayaks. </p>
<p>  The temples, now built of stone, became bigger, more complex and <br />  ornate with sculptures. Dravidian architecture reached its glory <br />  during the Chola period (900-1200 A.D.) by becoming more imposing in <br />  size and endowed with happy proportions. </p>
<p>  Among the most beautiful of the Chola temples is the Brhadisvara <br />  temple at Tanjore with its 66 metre high vimana, the tallest of its <br />  kind. The later Pandyans who succeeded the Cholas improved on the <br />  Cholas by introducing elaborate ornamentation and big sculptural <br />  images, many-pillared halls, new annexes to the shrine and towers <br />  (gopurams) on the gateways. </p>
<p>  The mighty temple complexes of Madurai and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu <br />  set a pattern for the Vijayanagar builders (1350-1565 A.D.) who <br />  followed the dravidian tradition. The Pampapati and Vitthala temples <br />  in Hampi are standing examples of this period. The Nayaks of Madurai <br />  who succeeded the Vijayanagar kings (1600-1750 A.D.) made the <br />  dravidian temple complex even more elaborate by making the gopurams <br />  very tall and ornate and adding pillared corridors within the temple <br />  long compound.</p>
<p>  Contemporaneous with the Cholas (1100-1300A.D.), the Hoysalas who <br />  ruled the Kannada country improved on the Calukyan style by building <br />  extremely ornate temples in many parts of Karnataka noted for the <br />  sculptures in the walls, depressed ceilings, lathe-turned pillars <br />and <br />  fully sculptured vimanas. Among the most famous of these temples are <br />  the ones at Belur, Halebid and Somanathapura in south Karnataka, <br />  which are classified under the vesara style.</p>
<p>  In the north, the chief developments in Hindu temple architecture <br />  took place in Orissa (750-1250 A.D.) and Central India (950-1050 <br />  A.D.) as also Rajasthan (10th and 11th Century A.D.) and Gujarat <br />  (11th-13th Century A.D.). </p>
<p>  The temples of Lingaraja (Bhubaneshwar), Jagannatha (Puri) and Surya <br />  (Konarak) represent the Orissan style. The temple at Khajuraho built <br />  by the Chandellas, the Surya temple at Modhera (Gujarat0 and other <br />  temple at Mt. Abu built by the Solankis have their own distinct <br />  features in Central indian architecture. Bengal with its temples <br />  built in bricks and terracotta tiles and Kerala with its temples <br />  having peculiar roof structure suited to the heavy rainfall of the <br />  region, developed their own localised special styles.</p>
<p>  Mention may also be made here of the various Hindu temples outside <br />  India, especially in the South East Asian countries. The earliest of <br />  such Hindu temples are found in Java; for instance, the Siva temples <br />  at Dieng and (idong Songo built by the kings of Sailendra dynasty <br />  (8th-9th century A.D.). </p>
<p>  The group of temples of Lara Jonggrang at Pranbanan (9th or 10th <br />  century A.D.), is a magnificent example of Hindu temple <br />architecture. <br />  Other temples worth mentioning are: the temple complex at Panataran <br />  (java) built by the kings of Majapahit dynasty (14th century A.D.), <br />  the rock-cut temple facades at Tampaksiring of Bali (11th century <br />  A.D.), the 'mother' temple at Besakh of Bali (14th century A.D.), <br />the <br />  Chen La temples at Sambor Prei Kuk in Cambodia (7th-8th century <br />  A.D.)., the temple of Banteay Srei at Angkor (10th century A.D.) and <br />  the celebrated Angkor vat complex (12th century A.D.) built by Surya <br />  varman II.</p>

          Importance of Pudukottai District in Tamil Nadu History        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Mr Balasubramani</p>
<p>It is nice to read the Importance of Pudukottai in the History of Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>Let me add few more points to this topic, <br />1.Present day Pudukottai Dist. had been very significant in the political History of Tamil nadu, Because It is a bufferland between the Chola and Pandya domains.This is evident from the existence of many both early Pandya ( Sreemara srivallaba,Kochadaiyan ) and earl Chola Temples around Thirumayam and Kodumbalur and Kudumiyan malai famous for musical note inscriptions of Mahendravarma Pallava, a Great personality in Tamil history. </p>

<p>BIRTH PLACE : URAIYUR-</p>
<p>LIVED AT VILLUPURAM,PONDY,NEYVELI,CHENNAPATTINAM.</p>
<p>PRESENTLY AT BHUBANESWAR- ORISSA SINCE 1989.</p>
<p>Narthamalai : This is a place of historical importance and the head-quarters of the Mutharaiya chieftains. The earliest structural stone temple, circular in shape, built by the Mutharaiyar and the Vijayalaya Choleeswaram cave temple built by the Vijayala Chola, the first king of the later Cholas are located here. </p>
<p>Sri Kokaraneswarar temple : The rock cut cave temple of Sri Kokaraneswarar and Brahadambal at Thirukokarnam is of Mahendravarma Pallava's period. </p>
<p>Government Museum : The rare collections in the sections of Geology, Zoology, Paintings, Anthropology, Epigraphy and Historical Records etc. are very interesting and informative. The beautiful sculptures and bronzes of various periods are attractive items of this museum. </p>
<p>Sittannavasal : This ancient abode of Jains dating back to the 2nd century B.C. is about 16 kms. from Pudukkottai. The rock-cut cave temple with its beautiful frescoes and paintings in natural colours as in Ajantha in Maharashtra and stonebeds known as Eladipattam, a cave in which the Jain monks were said to have sought refuge in those days are the main attractions. </p>
<p>There are a few sculptures of Jain Thirthankaras in the Ardhamandapam and the inner shrine of the cave temple. the ceiling of the Ardhamandapam contains fresco paintings of the 7th century A.D. Inscriptions of the 9th-10th century A.D. are also found in the cave. The cave temple is said to have been excavated in the 7th century A.D. by the Pallava King Mahendravarman. In the area around Sittanna-vasal, there are many historical burial sites consisting of Kurangupatarai, cairns, burial urns and casts etc. </p>
<p>Kudumiyamalai : It is 20 kms. from Pudukkottai. There are beautiful sculptures and thousand- pillar hall in the temple. The presiding deity is Sikhagiriswarar.

<p>Kodumbalur : This place, also known as Muvarkoil is 36 kms. from Pudukkottai and 42 kms. from Trichy. It was formerly the seat of Irukkavelirs who were related to Cholas. </p>
<p>Out of the three shrines of Muvarkoil, only two exist now. These temples were built by Budhi Viramakesan in the 10th century A.D. The architecture of this temple is unique among the South Indian temples. The sculptures of Kalarimurthi, Gajasamharamurthi, Ardhanari and Gangadara-murthi etc. are interesting masterpieces of art. Nearby is the Muchukundeswarar temple of the early Chola period. </p>
<p>Viralimalai : This town lies north-west of Pudukkottai about 40 kms. Throughout the district and even outside, this place is well known for the Subramania temple on the hill here and is said to exist before 15th century A.D. The principal idol is eated on the peacock with his consorts on either side. There is a peacock with his consorts on either side. There is a peacock sanctuary here. Viralimalai has been mentioned in the Tamil book of hymns Thiruppugazh. </p>
<p>Tirumayam : This place, a taluk headquarters is 19 kms. from Pudukkottai, the district headquarters. The fort, the Siva and Vishnu temples are the tourist attractions here. The famous Vishnavite saint Thirumangai Alwar is supposed to have lived here before the 10th century. the ruins of an old fort exist here and it is said that the Poligar of Panjalankurichi was imprisoned in this before he was handed over to the British by the Tondaiman. </p>
<p>The Sengirai forest near this place is significant for it is believed that this forest was the abode of the demoness Tataka who was killed by Sri Rama. the fort played an important role in the history of Tondaiman rulers of Pudukkottai and the British.

The temple is supposed to have been built by this saint whose image is installed in it. It is famous as an exquisite structure. The temple is noted for its granite roof work. </p>
<p>The sanctum sanctorum is covered with copper plate and is similar to the Chidambaram Natarajar temple. A peculiarity in this temple is that it contains no images of the principal deities-Siva and Parvathi and that the worship is done to their pedestals.

<p>You have made a very good account on evolution of Temple architecture in <br />the Indian subcontinent. However, one can see the transformation of dynastical style of South indian temples at the following archaeological sites</p>
<p>namely 1. Sreenivasanallur, 2.Vijayalaya choleeswaram at Narthamalai.</p>
<p>GSK </p>
<p>"s.balasubramani" <kalinga_tamil@yahoo.co.in  wrote:<br />A Brief History of Hindu Temples</kalinga_tamil@yahoo.co.in></p>
<p>How and when the first temple took its birth is anybody's guess. <br />Temples do not seem to have existed during the Vedic age. </p>
<p>The practice of preparing images of the deities mentioned in the <br />Vedic mantras might have come into vogue by the end of the Vedic <br />period. The view that the yagasala of the Vedic period gradually got <br />metamorphosed into temples by the epic period owing to the influence <br />of the cults of devotion is widely accepted.</p>
<p>The earliest temples were built with perishable materials like timber <br />and clay. Cave-temples, temples carved out of the stone or built with <br />bricks came later. Heavy stone structures with ornate architecture <br />and sculpture belong to a still later period.</p>
<p>Considering the vast size of this country, is is remarkable that the <br />building of temple has progressed more or less on a set pattern. This <br />is because there is a basic philosophy behind the temple, its meaning <br />and significance, which will be explained later.</p>
<p>In spite of the basic pattern being the same, varieties did appear, <br />gradually leading to the evolution of different styles in temple <br />architecture. Broadly speaking, these can be bifurcated into the <br />northern and the southern styles. </p>
<p>The northern style, technically called nagara, is distinguished by <br />the curvilinear towers. </p>
<p>The southern style, known as the dravida, has its towers in the form <br />of truncated pyramids. A third style, vesara by name, is sometimes <br />added, which combines in itself both these styles.</p>
<p>The earliest temples in north and central India which have withstood <br />the vagaries of time belong to the Gupta period, 320-650 A. D. <br />Mention may be meda of the temples at Sanchi, Tigawa (near Jabbalpur <br />in Madhya Pradesh), Bhumara (in Madhya Pradesh), Nachna (Rajasthan) <br />and Deogarh (near Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh).</p>
<p>Among the earliest surviving temples in South India are found in <br />Tamil Nadu and northern Karnataka. The cradle of Dravidan school of <br />architecture was the Tamil country which evolved from the earliest <br />Buddhist shrines which were both rock-cut and structural. </p>
<p>The later rock-cut temples which belong roughly to the period 500-800 <br />A.D. were mostly Brahmanical or Jain, patronised by three great <br />ruling dynasties of the south, namely the Pallavas of Kanchi in the <br />east, the Calukyas of Badami in the 8th century A.D, the Rastrakutas <br />of Malkhed came to power and they made great contributions to the <br />development of south Indian temple architecture. The Kailasanatha <br />temple at Ellora belongs to this period.</p>
<p>In the west (northern Karnataka) the Aihole and Pattadakal group of <br />temples (5th to 7th centuries) show early attempts to evolve an <br />acceptable regional style based on tradition. </p>
<p>Among the better known early structural temples at Aihole are the <br />Huchimalligudi and Durga temples as also the Ladkhan temple, all <br />assigned to the period 450-650 A.D. Equally important are the temples <br />of Kasinatha, Papanatha, Sangamesvara, Virupaksa and others in <br />Pattadakal near Aihole as also the Svargabrahma temple at Alampur <br />(Andhra Pradesh). </p>
<p>It is in some of these temples, built by the later Calukyas, that we <br />come across the vesara style, a combination of the northern and the <br />southern modes.</p>
<p>There are many ancient texts laying down the formal architectural <br />styles prevalent in the various regions so that the comprehensive <br />text called the Vastu Sastra has its sources in the Sutras, Puranas <br />and Agamas besides Tantric literature and the Brhat Samhita. </p>
<p>But all of them are agreed that basically styles can be divided into <br />nagara, dravida and vesara. They employ respectively the square, <br />octagon and the apse or circle in their plan. In its later evolution <br />when the vesara style adopted the square for the sanctum. The <br />circular or stellar plan was retained for the vimana. </p>
<p>These three styles do not pertain strictly to three different regions <br />but as indicating only the temple groups. The vesara, for instance, <br />which came to pravail mostly in western Deccan and south Karnataka <br />was a derivation from the apsidal chapels of the early Buddhist <br />period which the Brahmanical faith adopted and vastly improved. In <br />its origin, the vesara is as much north Indian as it is west <br />Deccanese. </p>
<p>Similarly among the 6th &#150; 7th century shrines of Aihole and <br />Pattadakal we find evidance of nagara style in the prasadas or <br />vimanas. </p>
<p>The dravida or Tamilian style cecame very popular throughout south <br />India only from the Vijayanagar times onward. While the prasada or <br />vimana of the nagara style rises vertically from its base in a <br />curvilinear form, that of the dravida rises like a stepped pyramid, <br />tier upon tier. The northern style came to prevail in Rajasthan Upper <br />India, Orissa, the Vindhyan uplands and Gujarat.</p>
<p>During the next thousand years (from600 to 1600 A.D.) there was a <br />phenomenal growth in temple architecture both in quantity and <br />quality. </p>
<p>The first in the series of southern or dravidian architecture was <br />initiated by the Pallavas (600-900A.D.) The rock-cut temples at <br />Mahabalipuram (of the `ratha' type) and the structural temples like <br />the shore temple at Mahabalipuram and the Kailasanatha and Vaikuntha <br />Perumal temples in Kancheepuram (700-800 A.D.) are the best <br />representatives of the Pallava style. </p>
<p>The Pallavas laid the foundations of the dravidian school which <br />blossomed to its full extent during the Colas, the Pandyas, the <br />Vijayanagar kings and the Nayaks. </p>
<p>The temples, now built of stone, became bigger, more complex and <br />ornate with sculptures. Dravidian architecture reached its glory <br />during the Chola period (900-1200 A.D.) by becoming more imposing in <br />size and endowed with happy proportions. </p>
<p>Among the most beautiful of the Chola temples is the Brhadisvara <br />temple at Tanjore with its 66 metre high vimana, the tallest of its <br />kind. The later Pandyans who succeeded the Cholas improved on the <br />Cholas by introducing elaborate ornamentation and big sculptural <br />images, many-pillared halls, new annexes to the shrine and towers <br />(gopurams) on the gateways. </p>
<p>The mighty temple complexes of Madurai and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu <br />set a pattern for the Vijayanagar builders (1350-1565 A.D.) who <br />followed the dravidian tradition. The Pampapati and Vitthala temples <br />in Hampi are standing examples of this period. The Nayaks of Madurai <br />who succeeded the Vijayanagar kings (1600-1750 A.D.) made the <br />dravidian temple complex even more elaborate by making the gopurams <br />very tall and ornate and adding pillared corridors within the temple <br />long compound.</p>
<p>Contemporaneous with the Cholas (1100-1300A.D.), the Hoysalas who <br />ruled the Kannada country improved on the Calukyan style by building <br />extremely ornate temples in many parts of Karnataka noted for the <br />sculptures in the walls, depressed ceilings, lathe-turned pillars and <br />fully sculptured vimanas. Among the most famous of these temples are <br />the ones at Belur, Halebid and Somanathapura in south Karnataka, <br />which are classified under the vesara style.</p>
<p>In the north, the chief developments in Hindu temple architecture <br />took place in Orissa (750-1250 A.D.) and Central India (950-1050 <br />A.D.) as also Rajasthan (10th and 11th Century A.D.) and Gujarat <br />(11th-13th Century A.D.). </p>
<p>The temples of Lingaraja (Bhubaneshwar), Jagannatha (Puri) and Surya <br />(Konarak) represent the Orissan style. The temple at Khajuraho built <br />by the Chandellas, the Surya temple at Modhera (Gujarat0 and other <br />temple at Mt. Abu built by the Solankis have their own distinct <br />features in Central indian architecture. Bengal with its temples <br />built in bricks and terracotta tiles and Kerala with its temples <br />having peculiar roof structure suited to the heavy rainfall of the <br />region, developed their own localised special styles.</p>
<p>Mention may also be made here of the various Hindu temples outside <br />India, especially in the South East Asian countries. The earliest of <br />such Hindu temples are found in Java; for instance, the Siva temples <br />at Dieng and (idong Songo built by the kings of Sailendra dynasty <br />(8th-9th century A.D.). </p>
<p>The group of temples of Lara Jonggrang at Pranbanan (9th or 10th <br />century A.D.), is a magnificent example of Hindu temple architecture. <br />Other temples worth mentioning are: the temple complex at Panataran <br />(java) built by the kings of Majapahit dynasty (14th century A.D.), <br />the rock-cut temple facades at Tampaksiring of Bali (11th century <br />A.D.), the 'mother' temple at Besakh of Bali (14th century A.D.), the <br />Chen La temples at Sambor Prei Kuk in Cambodia (7th-8th century <br />A.D.)., the temple of Banteay Srei at Angkor (10th century A.D.) and <br />the celebrated Angkor vat complex (12th century A.D.) built by Surya <br />varman II.</p>
