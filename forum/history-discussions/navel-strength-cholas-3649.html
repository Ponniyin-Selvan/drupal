</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Navel strength of Cholas</p>
<p>The overseas ventures of South India were ancient and extensive. <br />South India had long trading relations with the west through <br />transshipments at the Northern ports. </p>
<p>Tamil kingdoms became prosperous and encouraged sea trade by <br />developing harbours and providing quarters, warehouses and workshops <br />for Roman sailors and merchants. The ports had navigational <br />facilities like wharfs, repair yards, pilotage and even light houses. </p>
<p>This growth in trade resulted with competition between the Chola, the <br />Pandya and the Chera kings. Sri Lanka too was involved. In course of <br />time the Cholas became powerful and prosperous.</p>
<p>By the end of the 2nd century, voyages between India and South east <br />Asia became frequent. Malays and Indonesians also participated in the <br />growing traffic. The important South Indian trading ports were <br />Muzirs, Poduca, and Sopatma.<br />Barygaza in the gulf of Cambay and Tamralipti at the mouth of the <br />1 st century to the 4th century, Chinese reports mention large <br />numbers of Indians (Brahmins) staying in Malaya peninsula.</p>
<p>There were other Indian settlements in other parts of South-East <br />Asia. Indians had better organization, superior knowledge of <br />agriculture and road building and an efficient civil service. The <br />Indian merchant guilds enforced strict rules in trading practice, <br />price regulations and in the maintenance of standards of production. </p>
<p>They acted as bankers. Back home the trading cities became very <br />wealthy. The port Barygaza (Gujarat) was full of foreign merchants <br />and "There are more than a hundred families whose fortune amounts to <br />over a million ounces of silver". </p>
<p>The great Chola king Rajaraja 1 (AD 985 to 1014) tried to take the <br />Chera country under his control and took the key part of Quilon. He <br />is also said to have attacked Maldive Island and Sri Lanka. His son <br />Rajendra 1 (1014 to 1042 AD.) prepared a naval expedition against Sri <br />Vijaya, first taking Andaman and Nikobar Islands to serve as an <br />advance base. The Chola fleet sailed on and took several coastal <br />ports. This attack was only to break Sri Vijaya's commercial monopoly <br />and not to occupy it permanently.</p>
<p>Raja Rajendra, the powerful Chola king of the 10th century, knew the <br />great importance of foreign trade and built a powerful navy meant for <br />trade and war. He encouraged merchant guilds, checked his rival <br />kings, the Cheras and the Pandyas and suppressed Sri Lankan <br />competition by invading the island. He contained Arab competition by <br />sending a naval expedition against Maldives to stop the Arabs from <br />building and equiping merchant ships there. His successors, Rajendra <br />Chola 1 and Virarajendra continued and strengthened the maritime <br />tradition and made Tamil naval power invincible. </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola's son, Rajendra Chola extended Chola rule by further <br />conquest. In 1025 AD he crossed the Bay of Bengal with a strong <br />fleet, overran Pegu and later took the Andaman and Nicobar islands to <br />use as a base for an attack on Sri Vijaya. The object of the attack <br />was not to conquest and rule, but to break Srivijaya's commercial <br />monopoly and end the vexations suffered by Chola traders - after <br />settling the dispute, the two kingdoms had friendly relations.</p>
<p>Rajendra appears to have made a naval attack an Srivijaya a second <br />time, for reasons, which are not clear. The Kings of the far east <br />recognised his power and sought his friendship.</p>
<p>After Rajendra, the next famous Chola King was Virarajendra. His <br />major campaign was directed against Sri Lanka where King Vijaya Bahu <br />was forcibly expelling Chola settlers from Rohara. Virarajendra sent <br />a strong naval force under his general against Sri Lanka. The Cholas <br />won a great victory, entered Rohara and plundered several cities. <br />Vijayabahu was put to flight, but returned to re-conquer his lost <br />territories. </p>

His son <br />Rajendra 1 (1014 to 1042 AD.) prepared a naval expedition against Sri <br />Vijaya, first taking Andaman and Nikobar Islands to serve as an <br />advance base. The Chola fleet sailed on and took several coastal <br />ports. This attack was only to break Sri Vijaya's commercial monopoly <br />and not to occupy it permanently.</p>
<p>Raja Rajendra, the powerful Chola king of the 10th century, knew the <br />great importance of foreign trade and built a powerful navy meant for <br />trade and war. He encouraged merchant guilds, checked his rival <br />kings, the Cheras and the Pandyas and suppressed Sri Lankan <br />competition by invading the island. He contained Arab competition by <br />sending a naval expedition against Maldives to stop the Arabs from <br />building and equiping merchant ships there. His successors, Rajendra <br />Chola 1 and Virarajendra continued and strengthened the maritime <br />tradition and made Tamil naval power invincible. </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola's son, Rajendra Chola extended Chola rule by further <br />conquest. In 1025 AD he crossed the Bay of Bengal with a strong <br />fleet, overran Pegu and later took the Andaman and Nicobar islands to <br />use as a base for an attack on Sri Vijaya. The object of the attack <br />was not to conquest and rule, but to break Srivijaya's commercial <br />monopoly and end the vexations suffered by Chola traders - after <br />settling the dispute, the two kingdoms had friendly relations.</p>
<p>Rajendra appears to have made a naval attack an Srivijaya a second <br />time, for reasons, which are not clear. The Kings of the far east <br />recognised his power and sought his friendship.</p>
<p>After Rajendra, the next famous Chola King was Virarajendra. His <br />major campaign was directed against Sri Lanka where King Vijaya Bahu <br />was forcibly expelling Chola settlers from Rohara. Virarajendra sent <br />a strong naval force under his general against Sri Lanka. The Cholas <br />won a great victory, entered Rohara and plundered several cities. <br />Vijayabahu was put to flight, but returned to re-conquer his lost <br />territories. </p>

<p>  The overseas ventures of South India were ancient and extensive. <br />  South India had long trading relations with the west through <br />  transshipments at the Northern ports. </p>
<p>  Tamil kingdoms became prosperous and encouraged sea trade by <br />  developing harbours and providing quarters, warehouses and workshops <br />  for Roman sailors and merchants. The ports had navigational <br />  facilities like wharfs, repair yards, pilotage and even light houses. </p>
<p>  This growth in trade resulted with competition between the Chola, the <br />  Pandya and the Chera kings. Sri Lanka too was involved. In course of <br />  time the Cholas became powerful and prosperous.</p>
<p>  By the end of the 2nd century, voyages between India and South east <br />  Asia became frequent. Malays and Indonesians also participated in the <br />  growing traffic. The important South Indian trading ports were <br />  Muzirs, Poduca, and Sopatma.<br />  Barygaza in the gulf of Cambay and Tamralipti at the mouth of the <br />  1 st century to the 4th century, Chinese reports mention large <br />  numbers of Indians (Brahmins) staying in Malaya peninsula.</p>
<p>  There were other Indian settlements in other parts of South-East <br />  Asia. Indians had better organization, superior knowledge of <br />  agriculture and road building and an efficient civil service. The <br />  Indian merchant guilds enforced strict rules in trading practice, <br />  price regulations and in the maintenance of standards of production. </p>
<p>  They acted as bankers. Back home the trading cities became very <br />  wealthy. The port Barygaza (Gujarat) was full of foreign merchants <br />  and "There are more than a hundred families whose fortune amounts to <br />  over a million ounces of silver". </p>

The Chola fleet sailed on and took several coastal <br />ports. This attack was only to break Sri Vijaya's commercial monopoly <br />and not to occupy it permanently.</p>
<p>Raja Rajendra, the powerful Chola king of the 10th century, knew the <br />great importance of foreign trade and built a powerful navy meant for <br />trade and war. He encouraged merchant guilds, checked his rival <br />kings, the Cheras and the Pandyas and suppressed Sri Lankan <br />competition by invading the island. He contained Arab competition by <br />sending a naval expedition against Maldives to stop the Arabs from <br />building and equiping merchant ships there. His successors, Rajendra <br />Chola 1 and Virarajendra continued and strengthened the maritime <br />tradition and made Tamil naval power invincible. </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola's son, Rajendra Chola extended Chola rule by further <br />conquest. In 1025 AD he crossed the Bay of Bengal with a strong <br />fleet, overran Pegu and later took the Andaman and Nicobar islands to <br />use as a base for an attack on Sri Vijaya. The object of the attack <br />was not to conquest and rule, but to break Srivijaya's commercial <br />monopoly and end the vexations suffered by Chola traders - after <br />settling the dispute, the two kingdoms had friendly relations.</p>
<p>Rajendra appears to have made a naval attack an Srivijaya a second <br />time, for reasons, which are not clear. The Kings of the far east <br />recognised his power and sought his friendship.</p>
<p>After Rajendra, the next famous Chola King was Virarajendra. His <br />major campaign was directed against Sri Lanka where King Vijaya Bahu <br />was forcibly expelling Chola settlers from Rohara. Virarajendra sent <br />a strong naval force under his general against Sri Lanka. The Cholas <br />won a great victory, entered Rohara and plundered several cities. <br />Vijayabahu was put to flight, but returned to re-conquer his lost <br />territories. </p>

          Navel Strength of Cholas        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear sir</p>
<p>Naval Strength of Cholas is well attested one in the History of Southern India. As Jawaharlal Nehru Pointed out in His 'Discovery of India', Apart from severed relations for crossing of the Chola Navayaikal across malacca strait in the Malayan peninsular during reign of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman aroun ca 1025 AD, There was an another reason for the Rajendra I for the Expedition against Srivijaya Kingdom that is , the Military assistance and logistical support was extended to the Singalease King by both Burmease King and the Father of V.T. varman. More than hundreds of Elephants were transported to Indian Mainland throu Navaigal. At this point, Even JH Nehru himself admires the Naval mighty of Imperial Cholas. This is also posted in the Official Web site of Myanmer. Even our Parliment inner Panels describe the Tamil Hero's Expedition Against the North India. </p>
<p>G.S. Krishnan.</p>
<p>"s.balasubramani" <kalinga_tamil@yahoo.co.in  wrote:<br />Navel strength of Cholas</kalinga_tamil@yahoo.co.in></p>
<p>The overseas ventures of South India were ancient and extensive. <br />South India had long trading relations with the west through <br />transshipments at the Northern ports. </p>
<p>Tamil kingdoms became prosperous and encouraged sea trade by <br />developing harbours and providing quarters, warehouses and workshops <br />for Roman sailors and merchants. The ports had navigational <br />facilities like wharfs, repair yards, pilotage and even light houses. </p>
<p>This growth in trade resulted with competition between the Chola, the <br />Pandya and the Chera kings. Sri Lanka too was involved. In course of <br />time the Cholas became powerful and prosperous.</p>
<p>By the end of the 2nd century, voyages between India and South east <br />Asia became frequent. Malays and Indonesians also participated in the <br />growing traffic. The important South Indian trading ports were <br />Muzirs, Poduca, and Sopatma.<br />Barygaza in the gulf of Cambay and Tamralipti at the mouth of the <br />1 st century to the 4th century, Chinese reports mention large <br />numbers of Indians (Brahmins) staying in Malaya peninsula.</p>
<p>There were other Indian settlements in other parts of South-East <br />Asia. Indians had better organization, superior knowledge of <br />agriculture and road building and an efficient civil service. The <br />Indian merchant guilds enforced strict rules in trading practice, <br />price regulations and in the maintenance of standards of production. </p>
<p>They acted as bankers. Back home the trading cities became very <br />wealthy. The port Barygaza (Gujarat) was full of foreign merchants <br />and "There are more than a hundred families whose fortune amounts to <br />over a million ounces of silver". </p>
<p>The great Chola king Rajaraja 1 (AD 985 to 1014) tried to take the <br />Chera country under his control and took the key part of Quilon. He <br />is also said to have attacked Maldive Island and Sri Lanka. His son <br />Rajendra 1 (1014 to 1042 AD.) prepared a naval expedition against Sri <br />Vijaya, first taking Andaman and Nikobar Islands to serve as an <br />advance base. The Chola fleet sailed on and took several coastal <br />ports. This attack was only to break Sri Vijaya's commercial monopoly <br />and not to occupy it permanently.</p>
<p>Raja Rajendra, the powerful Chola king of the 10th century, knew the <br />great importance of foreign trade and built a powerful navy meant for <br />trade and war. He encouraged merchant guilds, checked his rival <br />kings, the Cheras and the Pandyas and suppressed Sri Lankan <br />competition by invading the island. He contained Arab competition by <br />sending a naval expedition against Maldives to stop the Arabs from <br />building and equiping merchant ships there. His successors, Rajendra <br />Chola 1 and Virarajendra continued and strengthened the maritime <br />tradition and made Tamil naval power invincible. </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola's son, Rajendra Chola extended Chola rule by further <br />conquest. In 1025 AD he crossed the Bay of Bengal with a strong <br />fleet, overran Pegu and later took the Andaman and Nicobar islands to <br />use as a base for an attack on Sri Vijaya. The object of the attack <br />was not to conquest and rule, but to break Srivijaya's commercial <br />monopoly and end the vexations suffered by Chola traders - after <br />settling the dispute, the two kingdoms had friendly relations.</p>
<p>Rajendra appears to have made a naval attack an Srivijaya a second <br />time, for reasons, which are not clear. The Kings of the far east <br />recognised his power and sought his friendship.</p>
<p>After Rajendra, the next famous Chola King was Virarajendra. His <br />major campaign was directed against Sri Lanka where King Vijaya Bahu <br />was forcibly expelling Chola settlers from Rohara. Virarajendra sent <br />a strong naval force under his general against Sri Lanka. The Cholas <br />won a great victory, entered Rohara and plundered several cities. <br />Vijayabahu was put to flight, but returned to re-conquer his lost <br />territories. </p>

<p>The overseas ventures of South India were ancient and extensive. <br />South India had long trading relations with the west through <br />transshipments at the Northern ports. </p>
<p>Tamil kingdoms became prosperous and encouraged sea trade by <br />developing harbours and providing quarters, warehouses and workshops <br />for Roman sailors and merchants. The ports had navigational <br />facilities like wharfs, repair yards, pilotage and even light houses. </p>
<p>This growth in trade resulted with competition between the Chola, the <br />Pandya and the Chera kings. Sri Lanka too was involved. In course of <br />time the Cholas became powerful and prosperous.</p>
<p>By the end of the 2nd century, voyages between India and South east <br />Asia became frequent. Malays and Indonesians also participated in the <br />growing traffic. The important South Indian trading ports were <br />Muzirs, Poduca, and Sopatma.<br />Barygaza in the gulf of Cambay and Tamralipti at the mouth of the <br />1 st century to the 4th century, Chinese reports mention large <br />numbers of Indians (Brahmins) staying in Malaya peninsula.</p>
<p>There were other Indian settlements in other parts of South-East <br />Asia. Indians had better organization, superior knowledge of <br />agriculture and road building and an efficient civil service. The <br />Indian merchant guilds enforced strict rules in trading practice, <br />price regulations and in the maintenance of standards of production. </p>
<p>They acted as bankers. Back home the trading cities became very <br />wealthy. The port Barygaza (Gujarat) was full of foreign merchants <br />and "There are more than a hundred families whose fortune amounts to <br />over a million ounces of silver". </p>
<p>The great Chola king Rajaraja 1 (AD 985 to 1014) tried to take the <br />Chera country under his control and took the key part of Quilon. He <br />is also said to have attacked Maldive Island and Sri Lanka. His son <br />Rajendra 1 (1014 to 1042 AD.) prepared a naval expedition against Sri <br />Vijaya, first taking Andaman and Nikobar Islands to serve as an <br />advance base. The Chola fleet sailed on and took several coastal <br />ports. This attack was only to break Sri Vijaya's commercial monopoly <br />and not to occupy it permanently.</p>
<p>Raja Rajendra, the powerful Chola king of the 10th century, knew the <br />great importance of foreign trade and built a powerful navy meant for <br />trade and war. He encouraged merchant guilds, checked his rival <br />kings, the Cheras and the Pandyas and suppressed Sri Lankan <br />competition by invading the island. He contained Arab competition by <br />sending a naval expedition against Maldives to stop the Arabs from <br />building and equiping merchant ships there. His successors, Rajendra <br />Chola 1 and Virarajendra continued and strengthened the maritime <br />tradition and made Tamil naval power invincible. </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola's son, Rajendra Chola extended Chola rule by further <br />conquest. In 1025 AD he crossed the Bay of Bengal with a strong <br />fleet, overran Pegu and later took the Andaman and Nicobar islands to <br />use as a base for an attack on Sri Vijaya. The object of the attack <br />was not to conquest and rule, but to break Srivijaya's commercial <br />monopoly and end the vexations suffered by Chola traders - after <br />settling the dispute, the two kingdoms had friendly relations.</p>
<p>Rajendra appears to have made a naval attack an Srivijaya a second <br />time, for reasons, which are not clear. The Kings of the far east <br />recognised his power and sought his friendship.</p>
<p>After Rajendra, the next famous Chola King was Virarajendra. His <br />major campaign was directed against Sri Lanka where King Vijaya Bahu <br />was forcibly expelling Chola settlers from Rohara. Virarajendra sent <br />a strong naval force under his general against Sri Lanka. The Cholas <br />won a great victory, entered Rohara and plundered several cities. <br />Vijayabahu was put to flight, but returned to re-conquer his lost <br />territories. </p>

<p>  The great Chola king Rajaraja 1 (AD 985 to 1014) tried to take the <br />  Chera country under his control and took the key part of Quilon. <br />He <br />  is also said to have attacked Maldive Island and Sri Lanka. His <br />son <br />  Rajendra 1 (1014 to 1042 AD.) prepared a naval expedition against <br />Sri <br />  Vijaya, first taking Andaman and Nikobar Islands to serve as an <br />  advance base. The Chola fleet sailed on and took several coastal <br />  ports. This attack was only to break Sri Vijaya's commercial <br />monopoly <br />  and not to occupy it permanently.</p>
<p>  Raja Rajendra, the powerful Chola king of the 10th century, knew <br />the <br />  great importance of foreign trade and built a powerful navy meant <br />for <br />  trade and war. He encouraged merchant guilds, checked his rival <br />  kings, the Cheras and the Pandyas and suppressed Sri Lankan <br />  competition by invading the island. He contained Arab competition <br />by <br />  sending a naval expedition against Maldives to stop the Arabs from <br />  building and equiping merchant ships there. His successors, <br />Rajendra <br />  Chola 1 and Virarajendra continued and strengthened the maritime <br />  tradition and made Tamil naval power invincible. </p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola's son, Rajendra Chola extended Chola rule by <br />further <br />  conquest. In 1025 AD he crossed the Bay of Bengal with a strong <br />  fleet, overran Pegu and later took the Andaman and Nicobar islands <br />to <br />  use as a base for an attack on Sri Vijaya. The object of the <br />attack <br />  was not to conquest and rule, but to break Srivijaya's commercial <br />  monopoly and end the vexations suffered by Chola traders - after <br />  settling the dispute, the two kingdoms had friendly relations.</p>
<p>  Rajendra appears to have made a naval attack an Srivijaya a second <br />  time, for reasons, which are not clear. The Kings of the far east <br />  recognised his power and sought his friendship.</p>
<p>  After Rajendra, the next famous Chola King was Virarajendra. His <br />  major campaign was directed against Sri Lanka where King Vijaya <br />Bahu <br />  was forcibly expelling Chola settlers from Rohara. Virarajendra <br />sent <br />  a strong naval force under his general against Sri Lanka. The <br />Cholas <br />  won a great victory, entered Rohara and plundered several cities. <br />  Vijayabahu was put to flight, but returned to re-conquer his lost <br />  territories.</p>
