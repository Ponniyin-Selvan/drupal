<p>Kindly go through the following:</p>
<p>Pre-Angkor civilisation site<br />March 5, 2009</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR- MALAYSIAN archaeologists on Thursday said they had<br />discovered the main site of an ancient kingdom that predates the Angkor<br />temples of Cambodia and could be the oldest civilisation in the region.<br />Archaeological team leader Professor Mokhtar Saidin said the find, which<br />could lead to a rewriting of history books on the region, was made in<br />two palm oil plantations in northern Kedah state last month.<br />He said buildings found at the site indicate it was part of the ancient<br />Hindu kingdom of Bujang which existed in the area some time in the third<br />century AD, predating the Angkor civilisation of Cambodia which<br />flourished from the 12th to 14th centuries.<br />'We have dated artifacts from what we belive are an administration<br />building and an iron smelter to 1,700 BP (years before present) which<br />sets the Bujang civilisation between the third and fourth century AD,'<br />he told AFP.<br />'We have only one date so far so we can say it is one of the earliest<br />civilisations in the region but with more dates we will be able to<br />verify whether it is the oldest civilisation in the region,' he added.<br />Mr Mokhtar said the iron smelter was a surprise find as it showed that<br />such an early civilisation was already quite advanced technologically.<br />'We have 30 more mounds at the site that have to be excavated and we are<br />hoping to also find the port area for the kingdom as it was near the<br />sea,' he added.<br />'This will give us a clue to how the civilisation was trading and<br />influenced by China and India, who would have been the two main powers<br />back then to have influenced development in this region.' Malaysian<br />archaeologists last month also announced the discovery of stone tools<br />they believe are more than 1.8 million years old and the earliest<br />evidence of human ancestors in South-east Asia.<br />The stone hand-axes were discovered last year in the historical site of<br />Lenggong in northern Perak state, embedded in a type of rock formed by<br />meteorites. ?

<p>And the article of Dr. S. Jayabharathi:</p>
<p>TAMIL HERITAGE...<br />the Tamils are an ancient people</p>
<p>Pallava Grantha Inscriptions of South East Asia<br />(c.7th century onwards)</p>
<p>(contributed by Dr.S.Jayabarathi, Malaysia<br /><http://www.geocities.com/arthur_avalon/pallavagrantha_inscriptions1.htm\<br />l  )</http://www.geocities.com/arthur_avalon/pallavagrantha_inscriptions1.htm\<br></p>
<p>Chhabra has pointed out long back that the Pallava script of SEA has<br />been pre-Pallava, just like Jesus going before Christ!</p>
<p>Can our learned scholars solve these riddles?</p>

<p>    Source:?http://www.thehindu.com/holnus/008200902151611.htm<br />    <http://www.thehindu.com/holnus/008200902151611.htm <br />    Chandigarh (PTI): The south east coast of Tamil Nadu was inhabited in<br />    pre-historic times mainly by Caucasoids, Mongoloids, Negroids and<br />    Australoids rather than people similar to contemporary Tamils, a dental<br />    anthropological study has found.</http://www.thehindu.com/holnus/008200902151611.htm></p>
<p>    A team of anthropologists came to the finding after studying more than<br />    1,000 teeth from Adichanallur's pre-historic harbour site on the<br />    south-east coast of Tamil Nadu that dates back to 2,500 BC.</p>
<p>    "Most of the teeth belonged to people of the four races and very few<br />    represented contemporary Tamil populations," a member of the study team<br />    Dr. P. Raghavan of the School of Archaeology and Anthropology,<br />    Australian National University at Canberra told PTI here on Sunday.</p>
<p>    Optical microscope techniques were employed to study the teeth, which<br />    have shown the various growth stages, ageing and wearing processes,<br />    racial and ethnic and geographical affinities, dietary patterns, jaw<br />    mechanism, constitutional abnormalities of the jaws, pathological<br />    problems including the infections and inherited diseases, Dr. Raghavan<br />    said.</p>
<p>    The other members of the study team were Dr. Gayatri Pathmanathan from<br />    the Department of Anthropology, Panjab University, Chandigarh and Dr T.<br />    Satyamurthy, Director, Academy of Archaeological Sciences of Ancient<br />    India, Chennai.</p>
<p>    "Our study will be presented at an International Ancient Tamil<br />    Archaeological Research Conference to be held at Chennai from March<br />    4-6," Dr. Raghavan told PTI.</p>
<p>    Throwing more light on their study, Dr. Raghavan said that considerable<br />    number of cheek teeth or molars were found in different stages of tooth<br />    wear.</p>
<p>    "In many cases, unequal tooth wear was observed on the left and right<br />    sides. Consuming hard food grains like pulses and nuts were the probable<br />    reasons for quick and heavy wearing along with the age factor," he said.</p>
<p>    Many pathological conditions were observed on the jaws and teeth. "Some<br />    were genetically controlled while others resulted from malnutrition<br />    including lack of vitamins and essential minerals. No deficiency cases<br />    were reported due to lack of iron or calcium," Dr. Raghavan said.</p>
<p>    Many cases, particularly relating to Negroid and Australoid skulls<br />    showed the mechanical removal of the upper central incisors by<br />    application of high force.</p>
<p>    "Even today, such cultural practice can be seen among certain tribes of<br />    Africa and Australian Aborigines," he said.</p>
<p>    According to Raghavan, the recovered skeletons showed many striking<br />    pathological and structural abnormalities, which were caused by a number<br />    of genetic variations, nutritional factors and bio-cultural alterations.</p>
<p>    "A large number of tumorous growths, sexually transmitted diseases and<br />    epidemic diseases including infectious diseases, age and work-related<br />    sicknesses particularly on bones were also identified," he said.</p>
<p>    Raghavan also said that observations on cranial fractures and crushing<br />    injuries on the recovered crania were caused by a number of lethal<br />    weapons used at that time.</p>
<p>    "On the basis of the nature of injuries, they were divided into<br />    sharp-edged incisions caused by metal/flint axes, penetrating wounds<br />    created by pointed weapons, linear fractures on the skulls which reflect<br />    the application of blunt and small weapons and gross crushing injuries<br />    caused by use of large stones and clubs," he said.</p></intellisurfer@></p></blockquote>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Date: 11-3-2009</p>
<p>Dear Sivapathasekaran,</p>
<p>Thanks for highlighting on the recent discoveries of an Administration Building and Iron Smelter by the Archaeological team lead by Professor Mokhtar Saidin in two palm oil plantations in northern Kedah state last month, who has said that the buildings found at the Site indicate it was part of the ancient Hindu kingdom of Bujang. </p>
<p>As per your advises, "Mr Mokhtar have also said the 'Iron Smelter' was a surprise find as it showed that such an early civilisation - was already quite advanced technologically".</p>
<p>My comments in connection with the above is as follows :</p>
<p>(1) The famed - ancient city of "Kadaram" was located at the Bujang Valley region of the present Kedah state in Malaysia. This was one of the regions where many Traders from Tamil Nadu flocked from the period of Pallava kingsof Tamil Nadu. The Kadaram of Malaysia was known to the medieval Arab Merchants as "Kalah" and Sri Vijaya of Sumatra as "Sri Buza".</p>
<p>During the period of Emperor Rajaraja Chola - 1 it appears there would havebeen already a sizable number of Traders from the Chola country and the other regions of Tamil Nadu (India) present in the Kadaram (Bujang Valley) region, along with a garrison of Chola Forces to safeguard the interests of these Traders. </p>
<p>It appears in between the years A.D.1002 and A.D.1005, Emperor Chulamanivarman of Sri Vijaya Empire in Sumatra, Indonesia who was also the "overlord king" of Kadarem, probably was assisted by this garrison of Chola Forces stationed already at Kadarem to suppress a revolt by the native king of Kadarem, against their overlord the Emperor Chulamanivarman of Sri Vijaya in Sumatra, Indonesia. This possibly made Rajaraja - 1 to claim his victory over Katakas - as seen from the Sanskrit portion of "Essaalam Copper Plates".(Note: Kadaram was known as Kataka in Sanskrit - Refer also the Aanaimangalam Copper Plates)</p>
<p>This could have been the beginning of the good diplomatic relations betweenthe Chola empire and the Sri Vijaya empire with the Emperor Chulamanivarman requesting land from Emperor Rajaraja Chola - 1 in A.D.1006 to build a Buddhist Temple at Nagapattinam the seaport city of Cholas for the benefit ofthe Sri Vijaya &amp; Kadarem Traders trading at this city. This gesture would have been reciprocated by the Sri Vijaya Emperor to the Chola Traders, and possibly the foundations of a Siva Temple discovered at Bujang valley hill (closer to Bujang Valley Archaeological Museum) could be (to be verified)one such temple.   </p>
<p>The finding of the "Iron Smelter" at Bujang Valley region is not a surprise, as the Tamil Literary work known as "Perumkathai" composed by Konguvelir (a lesser king from a Velir sect of Kongunadu of Tamil Nadu)around 11th century A.D. - mentions of "Iron from Kadaram" (Kadaraththu Irumbu)as among the Items from countries overseas and Indian mainland - "which he knew of" during his period of eleventh century when he composed the Literary Work "Perumkathai".</p>
<p>The reference is as follows:  </p>
<p>"....Ilangai Eelaththu kalam tharu Seppum<br />Imayaththu pirantha vayira saathiyum<br />Kadaraththu Irumbodu kaiyahaththu adakki...." </p>
<p>Perumkathai - by Konguvelir, Unjai Kaandam, lines 37/39<br />U.V.Saminatha Iyer publication.</p>
<p>The Administration Building "could be" one belonging to this period, or earlier period when Pallava kings were the contemporary kings in Tamil Nadu which need further study.</p>
<p>Also please note the period of composition of Perumkathai as determined by others as eleventh century - happens to be the period of capture of the Magadha kingdom by Rajaraja Chola - 1 as gleaned from Chola Copper Plates which is as follows:</p>
<p>ola - 1 captured Magadha among others. </p>
<p>The references to the regions captured by Rajaraja Chola - 1 in Karandai Thamil Sangam Plates are given as follows:<br />".....Magadharkalaiyum.....thoal valiyaal, poril ventru (won in warfare), avarkaludaiya, yaanaikalaiyum, kuthiraikalaiyum, naadukalaiyum, irraththinangalaiyum, selvangalaiyum, kaippatrinaan??." </p>
<p>Now on investigating the contents of the Essaalam Copper Plates we have thelist of countries conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1 stated as follows:</p>
<p>"???Arumolivarman who with his long and beautiful arms (that) bored the marks of sankhu andchakra in his palms. He conquered the.... Magadhas.....Andhras, Rattas, Oddas, "Katakas", Keralas, Gaudas and Pandiyas.  </p>
<p>ajaraja Chola ? 1. </p>
<p>Now we find an interesting information from Perumkathai which states in it's chapter titled Magadha kaandam as follows - while it describes the Cheris(means - collective settlements in Tamil): </p>
<p>"....Selvamodu ventri thaangiya iympathiniratti(hundred) Yavana cheriyum, enpathiniratti(hundred and sixty) Eripadai paadiyum,<br />alapparu sirappinil aayiramakiya(thousand) thalaiperum chenai 'Thamil cheriyum'..."</p>
<p>Perumkathai - by Konguvelir, Magadha Kaandam, lines 7/11<br />U.V.Saminatha Iyer publication.</p>
<p>As others have determined the period of Perumkathai as eleventh century, and as we find this happens to be the period the Rajaraja Chola conquest of Magadha country, the "thalaiperom chenai" possibly refers to the "principal large Chola garrison" stationed at Magadha country by Rajaraja Chola - 1 after it's capture. If this inference is further proved correct, then the date of Perumkathai is further confirmed as eleventh century.</p>
<p>As the author of Perumkathai of this period knew of Kadaraththu Irumbu, we can conclude Iron Smelter found in Kedah state could belong to a period when the contemporary Tamil Nadu was ruled by the Cholas or little early during the period of Pallavas.</p>

<p>  Kindly go through the following:</p>
<p>  Pre-Angkor civilisation site<br />  March 5, 2009</p>
<p>  KUALA LUMPUR- MALAYSIAN archaeologists on Thursday said they had<br />  discovered the main site of an ancient kingdom that predates the Angkor<br />  temples of Cambodia and could be the oldest civilisation in the region.<br />  Archaeological team leader Professor Mokhtar Saidin said the find, which<br />  could lead to a rewriting of history books on the region, was made in<br />  two palm oil plantations in northern Kedah state last month.<br />  He said buildings found at the site indicate it was part of the ancient<br />  Hindu kingdom of Bujang which existed in the area some time in the third<br />  century AD, predating the Angkor civilisation of Cambodia which<br />  flourished from the 12th to 14th centuries.<br />  'We have dated artifacts from what we belive are an administration<br />  building and an iron smelter to 1,700 BP (years before present) which<br />  sets the Bujang civilisation between the third and fourth century AD,'<br />  he told AFP.<br />  'We have only one date so far so we can say it is one of the earliest<br />  civilisations in the region but with more dates we will be able to<br />  verify whether it is the oldest civilisation in the region,' he added.<br />  Mr Mokhtar said the iron smelter was a surprise find as it showed that<br />  such an early civilisation was already quite advanced technologically.<br />  'We have 30 more mounds at the site that have to be excavated and we are<br />  hoping to also find the port area for the kingdom as it was near the<br />  sea,' he added.<br />  'This will give us a clue to how the civilisation was trading and<br />  influenced by China and India, who would have been the two main powers<br />  back then to have influenced development in this region.' Malaysian<br />  archaeologists last month also announced the discovery of stone tools<br />  they believe are more than 1.8 million years old and the earliest<br />  evidence of human ancestors in South-east Asia.<br />  The stone hand-axes were discovered last year in the historical site of<br />  Lenggong in northern Perak state, embedded in a type of rock formed by<br />  meteorites. ?

<p>      Source:?http://www.thehindu.com/holnus/008200902151611.htm<br />      <http://www.thehindu.com/holnus/008200902151611.htm <br />      Chandigarh (PTI): The south east coast of Tamil Nadu was inhabited in<br />      pre-historic times mainly by Caucasoids, Mongoloids, Negroids and<br />      Australoids rather than people similar to contemporary Tamils, a dental<br />      anthropological study has found.</http://www.thehindu.com/holnus/008200902151611.htm></p>
<p>      A team of anthropologists came to the finding after studying more than<br />      1,000 teeth from Adichanallur's pre-historic harbour site on the<br />      south-east coast of Tamil Nadu that dates back to 2,500 BC.</p>
<p>      "Most of the teeth belonged to people of the four races and very few<br />      represented contemporary Tamil populations," a member of the study team<br />      Dr. P. Raghavan of the School of Archaeology and Anthropology,<br />      Australian National University at Canberra told PTI here on Sunday.</p>
<p>      Optical microscope techniques were employed to study the teeth, which<br />      have shown the various growth stages, ageing and wearing processes,<br />      racial and ethnic and geographical affinities, dietary patterns, jaw<br />      mechanism, constitutional abnormalities of the jaws, pathological<br />      problems including the infections and inherited diseases, Dr. Raghavan<br />      said.</p>
<p>      The other members of the study team were Dr. Gayatri Pathmanathan from<br />      the Department of Anthropology, Panjab University, Chandigarh and Dr T.<br />      Satyamurthy, Director, Academy of Archaeological Sciences of Ancient<br />      India, Chennai.</p>
<p>      "Our study will be presented at an International Ancient Tamil<br />      Archaeological Research Conference to be held at Chennai from March<br />      4-6," Dr. Raghavan told PTI.</p>
<p>      Throwing more light on their study, Dr. Raghavan said that considerable<br />      number of cheek teeth or molars were found in different stages of tooth<br />      wear.</p>
<p>      "In many cases, unequal tooth wear was observed on the left and right<br />      sides. Consuming hard food grains like pulses and nuts were the probable<br />      reasons for quick and heavy wearing along with the age factor," he said.</p>
<p>      Many pathological conditions were observed on the jaws and teeth. "Some<br />      were genetically controlled while others resulted from malnutrition<br />      including lack of vitamins and essential minerals. No deficiency cases<br />      were reported due to lack of iron or calcium," Dr. Raghavan said.</p>
<p>      Many cases, particularly relating to Negroid and Australoid skulls<br />      showed the mechanical removal of the upper central incisors by<br />      application of high force.</p>
<p>      "Even today, such cultural practice can be seen among certain tribes of<br />      Africa and Australian Aborigines," he said.</p>
<p>      According to Raghavan, the recovered skeletons showed many striking<br />      pathological and structural abnormalities, which were caused by a number<br />      of genetic variations, nutritional factors and bio-cultural alterations.</p>
<p>      "A large number of tumorous growths, sexually transmitted diseases and<br />      epidemic diseases including infectious diseases, age and work-related<br />      sicknesses particularly on bones were also identified," he said.</p>
<p>      Raghavan also said that observations on cranial fractures and crushing<br />      injuries on the recovered crania were caused by a number of lethal<br />      weapons used at that time.</p>
<p>      "On the basis of the nature of injuries, they were divided into<br />      sharp-edged incisions caused by metal/flint axes, penetrating wounds<br />      created by pointed weapons, linear fractures on the skulls which reflect<br />      the application of blunt and small weapons and gross crushing injuries<br />      caused by use of large stones and clubs," he said.</p>
