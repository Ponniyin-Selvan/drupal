Some<br />where down the line, the Legend and True history got mixed up.

<p>  Hi,</p>
<p>  The two daughers ( yes angavai and sangavai) were married by poet <br />  kapilar and not avvai.<br />It says having ensured the <br />  safety of P?ri's daughter decided to ascend heaven and attain <br />  liberation and immolated himself on a rocky boulder on the river <br />  Pe&#7751;&#7751;ai near the V?ra&#7789;&#7789;?na temple. </p>
<p>  There is still today a stone there called kabilak kal...</p>

<p><a href="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume2/articles/thiruk-" title="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume2/articles/thiruk-">http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume2/articles/thiruk-</a><br />koyilur.html</p>
<p>Though the inscription is a long continuous record engraved on the <br />base of the temple, it consists of over 230 poetic lines with a loss <br />of few lines here and there, due to damage to the original. At the <br />end of the record are found three more poems recording different <br />endowments. Unfortunately after the inscription was copied by the <br />Government epigraphs in the year 190? , a thoughtless renovation <br />carried out has erased a major part of the record, which can only be <br />seen very feebly on the base now. The only record now available is <br />the paper impression of the inscription preserved in the office of <br />the Government Epigraphist at Mysore. </p>
<p>The inscription as mentioned earlier is in the form of a long Tamil <br />poem, set in the meter Aciryap-pa. An anthology of ten long poems <br />called the "Ten Idylls" of the Sangam age, of the beginning of the <br />Common Era, are well known to Tamil Scholars. They are (except the <br />first in praise of Lord Muruga) in praise of historic patrons like <br />the Chola, Pandya, and Tondaiman Ilamtirayan and others and their <br />liberal gifts to poets and singers. Four of them end praising the <br />patron, as the ruler of certain regions as listed below with the <br />lines given first and the name of the text against each. </p>

<blockquote><p>  I feel the bloodshed by the religions of Indian origin (Buddhism,<br />  Jainism) is far lesser than outside India. Sikhs - atleast it was<br />  transformed into a warrior class to defend the Muslim attrocities (as<br />  far as I know).</p></blockquote>
<p>hi Satish</p>
<p>Sikhs claim descent from the luv and kush and till the 9th guru - <br />there tenents are very similar to the other two religions you listed. <br />it was only the martying of the 9th guru and a few before that set <br />them on this path.....also the title sardar ( now a days we make much <br />fun of it - recently there was email circulating - which ridiculed <br />such jokers with just a single line - hv u ever seen a sardar <br />begging!!)</p>
<p>coming back to the subject - sardars are the first born male child who <br />were asked to be donated to the cause of the village and trained excl <br />in warfare - inorder to resemble the afgans in ferocity they were <br />advised not to cut their facial hair and carry a comb- Kesh. carry a <br />sword - kikirpan ....wear a metal ring that served as a insurance <br />against the tired hand dropping the sword - kada, wear a king of <br />shorts inside their dress, so that they could be ready for battle <br />immdly - kacha.....</p>
<p>while we are also discussing bravery - sadly we dont have hard data <br />from indian army about the ethinic mix - but two of them are <br />legendary - the sikh regiments and the gurkha regiments....</p>
<p>you would have seen the latest version of 300 spartans ( i like the <br />old version) but there is a similar sikh true version as well...read on</p>

<p>  Some interesting bit of news about Avvaiyar.... all poets during<br />  Sangam were singing poets or Bards.... Avvaiyar had a peculiar<br />  characteristics...she actually did some thing like present day<br />  lyricist.... she actually wrte the lyrics and make others to<br />  sing..like a drummer, dancer.... this make historians get <br />confused!!!!<br />  I still remember about a song where Dr. Zvelebil comments Avviyar <br />must<br />  have drummed during th song, Dr.Hart in his book would have <br />critised<br />  Dr.Zvelebil's observation and said the dummer would have sung song <br />of<br />  Avvaiyar.</p>

<p>    Thanks!</p>

<p>  Hi,</p>
<p>  The two daughers ( yes angavai and sangavai) were married by poet <br />  kapilar and not avvai.</p>
<p>  <a href="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume11/articles/article4.xml" title="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume11/articles/article4.xml">http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume11/articles/article4.xml</a></p>
<p>  The mention of poet Kapila in the inscription of R?jar?ja deserves <br />  greater attention. This place is associated with Kapilar, a great <br />  friend of P?ri, one of the seven celebrated patron of Sangam age. <br />  P?ri died in a battle with the three crowned kings of Tamilnad <br />  leaving his two daughters orphans. Kapilar took under his protection <br />  the two girls, visited the courts of the three kings and entreated <br />  them to marry them, but all of them refused. Finally he reached <br />  Thirukkoyilur and persuaded Maliyam?n to marry. This is alluded to <br />  in the Sangam poems and also later tradition. Thus Kapilar was <br />  closely connected with Thirukkoyilur. The poems sung by the <br />  daughters of P?ri are included in the Puran?n?&#7771;u collections .<br />They <br />  are seen lamenting the death of their father and their pitiable <br />  state. Kapilar was moved by the death of his friend P?ri and taking <br />  pity on the girls sings the situation in moving poems. There are <br />  several poems in Pu&#7771;am collections mentioning this poignant <br />  situation that would not fail to move any reader. This inscription <br />  of Thirukkoyilur mentions the poet Kapilar, and the marriage of <br />  P?ri's daughter to Malaiyam?&#7753; and adds more information not known <br />  from any other source about poet Kapilar. It says having ensured the <br />  safety of P?ri's daughter decided to ascend heaven and attain <br />  liberation and immolated himself on a rocky boulder on the river <br />  Pe&#7751;&#7751;ai near the V?ra&#7789;&#7789;?na temple. </p>
<p>  There is still today a stone there called kabilak kal...</p>
<p>  the two daughters sing thus on the loss of their father</p>
<p>  Attirai Thingall Avvennilavil<br />  Enthaium Kondom, Nam kundrum pirar kolaar</p>
<p>  Ittrai thingal Ivvenilavil<br />  Vendru eri murasin Venthar em<br />  Kundrum Kondaar; yaam enthayum ilame</p>
<p>  basically means in just one month ( one full moon to the next) we <br />  have lost our hill and our father...</p>
<p>  Kapilar meets kings Irungovel and introduces the girls thus </p>
<p>  Evvi thol kudi padeeyiyar....meaning in the lineage of the great vel <br />  Evvi.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The two daughers ( yes angavai and sangavai) were married by poet <br />kapilar and not avvai.</p>
<p><a href="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume11/articles/article4.xml" title="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume11/articles/article4.xml">http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume11/articles/article4.xml</a></p>
<p>The mention of poet Kapila in the inscription of R?jar?ja deserves <br />greater attention. This place is associated with Kapilar, a great <br />friend of P?ri, one of the seven celebrated patron of Sangam age. <br />P?ri died in a battle with the three crowned kings of Tamilnad <br />leaving his two daughters orphans. Kapilar took under his protection <br />the two girls, visited the courts of the three kings and entreated <br />them to marry them, but all of them refused. Finally he reached <br />Thirukkoyilur and persuaded Maliyam?n to marry. This is alluded to <br />in the Sangam poems and also later tradition. Thus Kapilar was <br />closely connected with Thirukkoyilur. The poems sung by the <br />daughters of P?ri are included in the Puran?n?&#7771;u collections . They <br />are seen lamenting the death of their father and their pitiable <br />state. Kapilar was moved by the death of his friend P?ri and taking <br />pity on the girls sings the situation in moving poems. There are <br />several poems in Pu&#7771;am collections mentioning this poignant <br />situation that would not fail to move any reader. This inscription <br />of Thirukkoyilur mentions the poet Kapilar, and the marriage of <br />P?ri's daughter to Malaiyam?&#7753; and adds more information not known <br />from any other source about poet Kapilar. It says having ensured the <br />safety of P?ri's daughter decided to ascend heaven and attain <br />liberation and immolated himself on a rocky boulder on the river <br />Pe&#7751;&#7751;ai near the V?ra&#7789;&#7789;?na temple. </p>
<p>There is still today a stone there called kabilak kal...</p>
<p>the two daughters sing thus on the loss of their father</p>
<p>Attirai Thingall Avvennilavil<br />Enthaium Kondom, Nam kundrum pirar kolaar</p>
<p>Ittrai thingal Ivvenilavil<br />Vendru eri murasin Venthar em<br />Kundrum Kondaar; yaam enthayum ilame</p>
<p>basically means in just one month ( one full moon to the next) we <br />have lost our hill and our father...</p>
<p>Kapilar meets kings Irungovel and introduces the girls thus </p>
<p>Evvi thol kudi padeeyiyar....meaning in the lineage of the great vel <br />Evvi.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathy,<br />I am really sad you have not acknowledged Thamirai the lyrcist of<br />'uyrin uyire ', 'vaseegara'. She is brilliant lyricist.</p>
<p>Pari was in the same time of Avvaiyar I guess.I will check it out.</p>
<p>But the legend is mixed up for the movie I guess.....</p>
<p>It was Kapilar a brahmin poet who was patronized by Pari. <br />Pari was ruler of small hills called Parambu. I dont know some how to<br />attack this small kingdom all the three kingdoms joined together and<br />destroyed him(purananuru 110). So Kapilar indebted to Pari saves the<br />two girls Angavai and Sangavai( i think these are the names but should<br />confirm....yeah same name for daughters of solomon papayya in<br />Sivaji)(pur.114). He tries to marry them to kings or princes. But no<br />one is ready to marry them. Hence finally he marries them both to<br />Brahmin boys(pur. 113).</p>
<p>These are all recorded in Purananuru... Kapilar atleats sings 10-12<br />songs on Pari and his Parambu hills and how he misses him(Purananuru<br />105-120). There is also a poem sung by Pari's<br />Makkal(daughters)(purananuru 112).</p>
<p>These are as recorded in Purananuru. Avvaiyar never comes in this<br />story.....but always down the line legends gets mixed up...</p>
<p>Like Kapilar was close to Pari, Avvaiyar was close to Adhiyaman<br />Netuman Anji.</p>

<p>      Kongu ther vazhkai is the seyyul stated by Lord<br />    Siva<br />      (supposedly) as an answer to the pandiya king's<br />    query<br />      on women's hair being fragrant naturally or not. I<br />      know it is sangam poetry supposedly written by<br />    Lord<br />      Shiva himself and as I remember it goes</p>
<p>      Kongu Ther Vazhkai anjirai thumbi<br />      kamam sepaadhu kandadhu mozhimo<br />      payiliyadhu keliya natpin mayilal seri ayitru<br />      arivai koondhalin nariyavum ulavo<br />      nee ariyum poove</p>
<p>      In two lines 'hey bee have you seen any flower<br />    more<br />      fragrant than this woman's hair'.</p>
<p>      It is very good to know Avvai and Valluvar did not<br />      live in same time. I remember my tamil teacher<br />    telling<br />      me that we do not even know their gender to be<br />    male or<br />      female although VAlluvar is probably male based on<br />    his<br />      references to women in kural. <br />      My dear mother who is no more was so offended when<br />    I<br />      mentioned Avvai may not be female as it<br />    contradicted<br />      her mental image of the immortal singer KB<br />    Sundarambal<br />      as Avvai!:)) So the potramarai/thirukkural story<br />    is<br />      also a legend...although I still get goose pimples<br />    to<br />      hear KBS's voice sing 'endrum udaya thamizhe kural<br />      etru kolla varuga' :))</p>

<p>        When it comes to Thirukkural and Avvaiyar, i<br />    dont<br />        see any period<br />        where they would have lived together. Though<br />    Tamil<br />        Nadu government has<br />        gone ahead and said Thiruvalluvar was born<br />    thirty<br />        years before chirst,<br />        all literary scholars and historians date<br />    Thirukural<br />        any where between<br />        5th to 10th century. The most closest dating<br />    would<br />        be around the 5-6th<br />        century(didactic age).<br />        Avvaiyar....there are many Avvaiyars ... The<br />    poet<br />        in Sangam<br />        literature who sings of Atiyaman Anci and many<br />    other<br />        poems might be<br />        different form Avvaiyars of Later periods.<br />    Avvaiyar<br />        and Agastya are<br />        the two most common people whose name has been<br />        linked to every other<br />        work.(Even in legends of thiruvilayadal which is<br />        work around 14th<br />        century). I have not come across any critical<br />    study<br />        specific to<br />        Avvaiyar, but Dr.Zvelebil says there are many<br />        Nakkirars and Avvaiyars<br />        in Tamil poetry.<br />        The Nakkiarar who wrote poems in Purananuru<br />    is<br />        different from<br />        Nakkirar who wrote commentry to Iraivanar<br />    Agaporul.<br />        If you ask<br />        question how can you find that?...its not easy<br />    for<br />        us...but literary<br />        scholars and linguist have specific methods....<br />    with<br />        each century the<br />        language attains some changes, so the compare<br />    the<br />        poems of the Two<br />        Nakkirars in question. The check the style,<br />    language<br />        usage,allusions<br />        employed etc. if its close enough and if the<br />    dating<br />        of two works are<br />        close enough they accept it as a single author.<br />    But<br />        if there is<br />        drastic change in usage of language , if there<br />    are<br />        loan words which<br />        cannot be ascribed to certain period etc they<br />    come<br />        to conclusion that<br />        they are work of two different poets....(only<br />        manirathanam can take a<br />        manirathanam movie...Perarasu if he changes his<br />    name<br />        to Manirathanam<br />        and directs a movie...people can surely<br />    recogonise<br />        that its surely not<br />        Manirathanams movie!)</p>
<p>        So to my knowledge as of now the most popular<br />        Avvaiyar did not live in<br />        period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was<br />    atleast 2<br />        centuries after<br />        Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.</p>
<p>        Probably the base to such legend would have been<br />    the<br />        Saiva,Jain<br />        ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like<br />    Appar<br />        threw some poetry on<br />        palm leaves into the river...to see which one<br />    came<br />        back to shore and<br />        which left to prove the religions supremacy...</p>
<p>        Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come<br />        across any critical<br />        study I will surely post it here!</p>

<p>      Hi,<br />      sorry for my ignorance...if you give more<br />      information on 'Kongu ther<br />      vazhkai' I will try to find it out.<br />      Sorry once more about my ignorance , i dont<br />  know<br />      about the<br />      Thriukural legend too.</p>
<p>      When it comes to Thirukkural and Avvaiyar, i<br />  dont<br />      see any period<br />      where they would have lived together. Though<br />  Tamil<br />      Nadu government has<br />      gone ahead and said Thiruvalluvar was born<br />  thirty<br />      years before chirst,<br />      all literary scholars and historians date<br />  Thirukural<br />      any where between<br />      5th to 10th century. The most closest dating<br />  would<br />      be around the 5-6th<br />      century(didactic age).<br />      Avvaiyar....there are many Avvaiyars ... The<br />  poet<br />      in Sangam<br />      literature who sings of Atiyaman Anci and many<br />  other<br />      poems might be<br />      different form Avvaiyars of Later periods.<br />  Avvaiyar<br />      and Agastya are<br />      the two most common people whose name has been<br />      linked to every other<br />      work.(Even in legends of thiruvilayadal which is<br />      work around 14th<br />      century). I have not come across any critical<br />  study<br />      specific to<br />      Avvaiyar, but Dr.Zvelebil says there are many<br />      Nakkirars and Avvaiyars<br />      in Tamil poetry.<br />      The Nakkiarar who wrote poems in Purananuru<br />  is<br />      different from<br />      Nakkirar who wrote commentry to Iraivanar<br />  Agaporul.<br />      If you ask<br />      question how can you find that?...its not easy<br />  for<br />      us...but literary<br />      scholars and linguist have specific methods....<br />  with<br />      each century the<br />      language attains some changes, so the compare<br />  the<br />      poems of the Two<br />      Nakkirars in question. The check the style,<br />  language<br />      usage,allusions<br />      employed etc. if its close enough and if the<br />  dating<br />      of two works are<br />      close enough they accept it as a single author.<br />  But<br />      if there is<br />      drastic change in usage of language , if there<br />  are<br />      loan words which<br />      cannot be ascribed to certain period etc they<br />  come<br />      to conclusion that<br />      they are work of two different poets....(only<br />      manirathanam can take a<br />      manirathanam movie...Perarasu if he changes his<br />  name<br />      to Manirathanam<br />      and directs a movie...people can surely<br />  recogonise<br />      that its surely not<br />      Manirathanams movie!)</p>
<p>      So to my knowledge as of now the most popular<br />      Avvaiyar did not live in<br />      period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was<br />  atleast 2<br />      centuries after<br />      Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.</p>
<p>      Probably the base to such legend would have been<br />  the<br />      Saiva,Jain<br />      ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like<br />  Appar<br />      threw some poetry on<br />      palm leaves into the river...to see which one<br />  came<br />      back to shore and<br />      which left to prove the religions supremacy...</p>
<p>      Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come<br />      across any critical<br />      study I will surely post it here!</p>

<p>        Vairam, who was the real author of 'kongu ther<br />        vazhkai'? Also is there some truth to legend<br />  about<br />        'Tirukkural' also - that it was thrown into<br />      potramarai</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Great minds have always been born into such turmoil filled times - <br />and they have led the people out of this, by their faith. But the <br />problem is two fold - </p>
<p>one - the followers of such interllectuals quickly godify him and a <br />cult follows. Most often the next levels of functionaries or the <br />subsequent followers totally mis interpret the original teachings. <br />Its the case even with buddhism. </p>
<p>So unless, we have the original teachings ( sadly they dont exist) <br />or peel away the later additions to look at the core, you dont <br />understand what was originaly said.</p>
<p>the second - more important - is we need to be aware of the short <br />comings of any event - its no longer wise to just cover up and <br />pretend that nothing happened. By reading what exactly transpired we <br />are wiser - and hopefully think twice before repeating past mistakes <br />( unfortunately todays politicians use the same tool in reverse - <br />rake up old wounds to fester rather than see the cause and heal)</p>

<p>    You cannot pine religion to all misdeeds of humans. It is like <br />    literature, there are various interpretations. Some are material <br />some <br />    are spiritual. Pick a number, stand in line :-)</p>

<p>          Hi vairam</p>
<p>          The legend is appar engaged jains in a debate in<br />          front of mahendra <br />          pallava. the test was not floating palm leaves on<br />          water but a test of <br />          fire..</p>
<p>          This happens after appar's reconversion back ( born<br />          as marul <br />          neeikiyaar - into jain faith as dharmasenar and then<br />          into the shivaite <br />          faith as tiru navukkarasar ...fondly called as appar<br />          by gyana <br />          sambandar) - the king himself into the jain faith,<br />          was goaded by the <br />          jain monks fearing the retribution of a popular jain<br />          monk embracing <br />          shivism...led the king to subject appar to many<br />          tortures - incl being <br />          confined into a cell for a week without food or<br />          water, being poisoned, <br />          trying be crushed under an elephants foot and then<br />          finally being tied <br />          to a stone and dropped into the sea....( dont want<br />          to take the <br />          comparison to the dasavataram again)....appar<br />          emerged unscathed which <br />          sowed seeds of doubt into the kings mind... each of<br />          these episodes are <br />          beautifully sung in tamil verse by appar ( its not<br />          for nothing that he <br />          is called navukkuarasar - the king of the tongue)</p>
<p>          inorder to clear the doubt about which faith was<br />          stronger mahendra <br />          engaged appar with a debate with the jain<br />          monks...both argued for long <br />          without any clear winner emerging...finally they<br />          agreed to a <br />          test...wherein each wrote a verse in palm leaf and<br />          threw it into a <br />          fire....appar's emerged unscathed but the jain work<br />          perished...this <br />          made mahendra convert back to shivism ....and not<br />          much publisised but <br />          has to be admitted - a brutal attack at wiping out<br />          the jain faith in <br />          tamil land...which included impaling them on stakes<br />          ( kazuvil <br />          ettruthal), mass murder - leaving their bodies to be<br />          consumed by dogs <br />          and foxs...etc. all these are also sung...the king<br />          also destroyed a <br />          large number of jain schools and places of worship </p>
<p>          this is a very significant and turning point in<br />          tamil land, if not for <br />          this - i would have had to sign off as vijay<br />          jain....</p>

        <p>Yeah, to me it is like this. Any mass philosophy will<br />have its pit falls, whether it is mass religion or<br />mass athiesm or mass anything. A group of people put<br />together in a room, one will be leader other his<br />enemy, they will form gangs and fight. It is the<br />nature of human mind. Even Zen religon has had its<br />politicians, why hinduism or buddhism or islam.<br />Scientists have their politics too beleive it or not,<br />gang wars and his theory versus mine happens in<br />university halls all the time.</p>
<p>To me faith is something to be kept in private.<br />Whether i need to be Taoist or an idol worshipping<br />hindu depends on my background, what life has dealt my<br />way, and what makes sense to me to deal with life's<br />tribulations. When we say that is what should make<br />sense to another we have trouble, that is all.</p>

        <p>The avaiyar of sangam period's words have so much difference in <br />avaiyar of Sundarar time.</p>
<p>Look at the words of aram seya virumbu to setha kilapu senthamarayum <br />(vinayakar agaval - detailed kundalini hymn with the agaram), they <br />talk about two different era's of people mind set. Infact the spell <br />of sangam and the thirukural and simple notes of that period on <br />Avvai - point to a society in turmoil, i mean society needing to go <br />back to the 'basics', sangam bards composing of barer system and <br />model of life, specifically pre pallava and post 1st gen cholas.<br />Now look at the lits of Sundarar, Avvai (same time period) etc how <br />society has changed, what is wanted at the sangam age and what is <br />needed at the age of sundarar etc.</p>
<p>Going further down, the largest literacy work after the alwar - nayan <br />mar time is thirupugazh (1400 ad) with 16000 songs (1322 found) and <br />the works are amazingly construed from both sangam and each monarch <br />time. </p>
<p>The time of people writing poetry plays a very important role in the <br />poet's expressions and mind also.</p>

<p>  Some interesting bit of news about Avvaiyar.... all poets during<br />  Sangam were singing poets or Bards.... Avvaiyar had a peculiar<br />  characteristics...she actually did some thing like present day<br />  lyricist.... she actually wrte the lyrics and make others to<br />  sing..like a drummer, dancer.... this make historians get <br />confused!!!!<br />  I still remember about a song where Dr. Zvelebil comments Avviyar <br />must<br />  have drummed during th song, Dr.Hart in his book would have critised<br />  Dr.Zvelebil's observation and said the dummer would have sung song <br />of<br />  Avvaiyar.</p>

<p>    Vairam, I am sure you know, perhaps just forgotten so<br />    I will repeat what i know sitravukku therindadu.</p>
<p>    Kongu ther vazhkai is the seyyul stated by Lord Siva<br />    (supposedly) as an answer to the pandiya king's query<br />    on women's hair being fragrant naturally or not. I<br />    know it is sangam poetry supposedly written by Lord<br />    Shiva himself and as I remember it goes</p>
<p>    Kongu Ther Vazhkai anjirai thumbi<br />    kamam sepaadhu kandadhu mozhimo<br />    payiliyadhu keliya natpin mayilal seri ayitru<br />    arivai koondhalin nariyavum ulavo<br />    nee ariyum poove</p>
<p>    In two lines 'hey bee have you seen any flower more<br />    fragrant than this woman's hair'.</p>
<p>    It is very good to know Avvai and Valluvar did not<br />    live in same time. I remember my tamil teacher telling<br />    me that we do not even know their gender to be male or<br />    female although VAlluvar is probably male based on his<br />    references to women in kural. <br />    My dear mother who is no more was so offended when I<br />    mentioned Avvai may not be female as it contradicted<br />    her mental image of the immortal singer KB Sundarambal<br />    as Avvai!:)) So the potramarai/thirukkural story is<br />    also a legend...although I still get goose pimples to<br />    hear KBS's voice sing 'endrum udaya thamizhe kural<br />    etru kolla varuga' :))</p>

<p>      When it comes to Thirukkural and Avvaiyar, i dont<br />      see any period<br />      where they would have lived together. Though Tamil<br />      Nadu government has<br />      gone ahead and said Thiruvalluvar was born thirty<br />      years before chirst,<br />      all literary scholars and historians date Thirukural<br />      any where between<br />      5th to 10th century. The most closest dating would<br />      be around the 5-6th<br />      century(didactic age).<br />      Avvaiyar....there are many Avvaiyars ... The poet<br />      in Sangam<br />      literature who sings of Atiyaman Anci and many other<br />      poems might be<br />      different form Avvaiyars of Later periods. Avvaiyar<br />      and Agastya are<br />      the two most common people whose name has been<br />      linked to every other<br />      work.(Even in legends of thiruvilayadal which is<br />      work around 14th<br />      century). I have not come across any critical study<br />      specific to<br />      Avvaiyar, but Dr.Zvelebil says there are many<br />      Nakkirars and Avvaiyars<br />      in Tamil poetry.<br />      The Nakkiarar who wrote poems in Purananuru is<br />      different from<br />      Nakkirar who wrote commentry to Iraivanar Agaporul.<br />      If you ask<br />      question how can you find that?...its not easy for<br />      us...but literary<br />      scholars and linguist have specific methods.... with<br />      each century the<br />      language attains some changes, so the compare the<br />      poems of the Two<br />      Nakkirars in question. The check the style, language<br />      usage,allusions<br />      employed etc. if its close enough and if the dating<br />      of two works are<br />      close enough they accept it as a single author. But<br />      if there is<br />      drastic change in usage of language , if there are<br />      loan words which<br />      cannot be ascribed to certain period etc they come<br />      to conclusion that<br />      they are work of two different poets....(only<br />      manirathanam can take a<br />      manirathanam movie...Perarasu if he changes his name<br />      to Manirathanam<br />      and directs a movie...people can surely recogonise<br />      that its surely not<br />      Manirathanams movie!)</p>
<p>      So to my knowledge as of now the most popular<br />      Avvaiyar did not live in<br />      period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was atleast 2<br />      centuries after<br />      Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.</p>
<p>      Probably the base to such legend would have been the<br />      Saiva,Jain<br />      ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar<br />      threw some poetry on<br />      palm leaves into the river...to see which one came<br />      back to shore and<br />      which left to prove the religions supremacy...</p>
<p>      Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come<br />      across any critical<br />      study I will surely post it here!</p>

<p>        Vairam, who was the real author of 'kongu ther<br />        vazhkai'? Also is there some truth to legend about<br />        'Tirukkural' also - that it was thrown into<br />      potramarai<br />        kulam and later came up on a golden lotus? (That<br />      is<br />        how it is depicted in the movie Avvaiyar.</p>

<p>      Thank you Vijay for the most interesting historical<br />      anecdote. Some historical incidents are too gory to<br />      even imagine, I often think of the PS episode where<br />      Veerapandiyan's head is impaled on a pole. </p>
<p>      I don't know really if that meant survival of Hinduism<br />      since compassion is at the heart of our faith. I know<br />      many jains too, of course, modern people but they are<br />      very kind, tolerant, sweet people. To me I'd rather<br />      say it was something people had to do in those times<br />      when society was not as evolved and leave it at<br />      that.Undoubtedly though reduced my respect for<br />      Mahendra Pallava.</p>

<p>        Hi vairam</p>
<p>        The legend is appar engaged jains in a debate in<br />        front of mahendra <br />        pallava. the test was not floating palm leaves on<br />        water but a test of <br />        fire..</p>
<p>        This happens after appar's reconversion back ( born<br />        as marul <br />        neeikiyaar - into jain faith as dharmasenar and then<br />        into the shivaite <br />        faith as tiru navukkarasar ...fondly called as appar<br />        by gyana <br />        sambandar) - the king himself into the jain faith,<br />        was goaded by the <br />        jain monks fearing the retribution of a popular jain<br />        monk embracing <br />        shivism...led the king to subject appar to many<br />        tortures - incl being <br />        confined into a cell for a week without food or<br />        water, being poisoned, <br />        trying be crushed under an elephants foot and then<br />        finally being tied <br />        to a stone and dropped into the sea....( dont want<br />        to take the <br />        comparison to the dasavataram again)....appar<br />        emerged unscathed which <br />        sowed seeds of doubt into the kings mind... each of<br />        these episodes are <br />        beautifully sung in tamil verse by appar ( its not<br />        for nothing that he <br />        is called navukkuarasar - the king of the tongue)</p>
<p>        inorder to clear the doubt about which faith was<br />        stronger mahendra <br />        engaged appar with a debate with the jain<br />        monks...both argued for long <br />        without any clear winner emerging...finally they<br />        agreed to a <br />        test...wherein each wrote a verse in palm leaf and<br />        threw it into a <br />        fire....appar's emerged unscathed but the jain work<br />        perished...this <br />        made mahendra convert back to shivism ....and not<br />        much publisised but <br />        has to be admitted - a brutal attack at wiping out<br />        the jain faith in <br />        tamil land...which included impaling them on stakes<br />        ( kazuvil <br />        ettruthal), mass murder - leaving their bodies to be<br />        consumed by dogs <br />        and foxs...etc. all these are also sung...the king<br />        also destroyed a <br />        large number of jain schools and places of worship </p>
<p>        this is a very significant and turning point in<br />        tamil land, if not for <br />        this - i would have had to sign off as vijay<br />        jain....</p>

I remember my tamil teacher telling<br />  me that we do not even know their gender to be male or<br />  female although VAlluvar is probably male based on his<br />  references to women in kural. <br />  My dear mother who is no more was so offended when I<br />  mentioned Avvai may not be female as it contradicted<br />  her mental image of the immortal singer KB Sundarambal<br />  as Avvai!:)) So the potramarai/thirukkural story is<br />  also a legend...although I still get goose pimples to<br />  hear KBS's voice sing 'endrum udaya thamizhe kural<br />  etru kolla varuga' :))</p>

<p>    When it comes to Thirukkural and Avvaiyar, i dont<br />    see any period<br />    where they would have lived together. Though Tamil<br />    Nadu government has<br />    gone ahead and said Thiruvalluvar was born thirty<br />    years before chirst,<br />    all literary scholars and historians date Thirukural<br />    any where between<br />    5th to 10th century. The most closest dating would<br />    be around the 5-6th<br />    century(didactic age).<br />    Avvaiyar....there are many Avvaiyars ... The poet<br />    in Sangam<br />    literature who sings of Atiyaman Anci and many other<br />    poems might be<br />    different form Avvaiyars of Later periods. Avvaiyar<br />    and Agastya are<br />    the two most common people whose name has been<br />    linked to every other<br />    work.(Even in legends of thiruvilayadal which is<br />    work around 14th<br />    century). I have not come across any critical study<br />    specific to<br />    Avvaiyar, but Dr.Zvelebil says there are many<br />    Nakkirars and Avvaiyars<br />    in Tamil poetry.<br />    The Nakkiarar who wrote poems in Purananuru is<br />    different from<br />    Nakkirar who wrote commentry to Iraivanar Agaporul.<br />    If you ask<br />    question how can you find that?...its not easy for<br />    us...but literary<br />    scholars and linguist have specific methods.... with<br />    each century the<br />    language attains some changes, so the compare the<br />    poems of the Two<br />    Nakkirars in question. The check the style, language<br />    usage,allusions<br />    employed etc. if its close enough and if the dating<br />    of two works are<br />    close enough they accept it as a single author. But<br />    if there is<br />    drastic change in usage of language , if there are<br />    loan words which<br />    cannot be ascribed to certain period etc they come<br />    to conclusion that<br />    they are work of two different poets....(only<br />    manirathanam can take a<br />    manirathanam movie...Perarasu if he changes his name<br />    to Manirathanam<br />    and directs a movie...people can surely recogonise<br />    that its surely not<br />    Manirathanams movie!)</p>
<p>    So to my knowledge as of now the most popular<br />    Avvaiyar did not live in<br />    period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was atleast 2<br />    centuries after<br />    Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.</p>
<p>    Probably the base to such legend would have been the<br />    Saiva,Jain<br />    ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar<br />    threw some poetry on<br />    palm leaves into the river...to see which one came<br />    back to shore and<br />    which left to prove the religions supremacy...</p>
<p>    Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come<br />    across any critical<br />    study I will surely post it here!</p>

<p>      Vairam, who was the real author of 'kongu ther<br />      vazhkai'? Also is there some truth to legend about<br />      'Tirukkural' also - that it was thrown into<br />    potramarai<br />      kulam and later came up on a golden lotus? (That<br />    is<br />      how it is depicted in the movie Avvaiyar.</p>

        <p>Vairam - what you say is true... to some extent. <br />I am yet to see a religion that preaches violence. It is a matter of <br />understanding and how people approach it and what people(people who <br />lead the understanding) use it for.</p>
<p>You cannot pine religion to all misdeeds of humans. It is like <br />literature, there are various interpretations. Some are material some <br />are spiritual. Pick a number, stand in line :-)</p>
<p>There are many thirupugazh stating their involvements and how gyana <br />sambandar brought back shavism faith.</p>

<p>    Thank you Vijay for the most interesting historical<br />    anecdote. Some historical incidents are too gory to<br />    even imagine, I often think of the PS episode where<br />    Veerapandiyan's head is impaled on a pole. </p>
<p>    I don't know really if that meant survival of Hinduism<br />    since compassion is at the heart of our faith. I know<br />    many jains too, of course, modern people but they are<br />    very kind, tolerant, sweet people. To me I'd rather<br />    say it was something people had to do in those times<br />    when society was not as evolved and leave it at<br />    that.Undoubtedly though reduced my respect for<br />    Mahendra Pallava.</p>

<p>      Hi vairam</p>
<p>      The legend is appar engaged jains in a debate in<br />      front of mahendra <br />      pallava. the test was not floating palm leaves on<br />      water but a test of <br />      fire..</p>
<p>      This happens after appar's reconversion back ( born<br />      as marul <br />      neeikiyaar - into jain faith as dharmasenar and then<br />      into the shivaite <br />      faith as tiru navukkarasar ...fondly called as appar<br />      by gyana <br />      sambandar) - the king himself into the jain faith,<br />      was goaded by the <br />      jain monks fearing the retribution of a popular jain<br />      monk embracing <br />      shivism...led the king to subject appar to many<br />      tortures - incl being <br />      confined into a cell for a week without food or<br />      water, being poisoned, <br />      trying be crushed under an elephants foot and then<br />      finally being tied <br />      to a stone and dropped into the sea....( dont want<br />      to take the <br />      comparison to the dasavataram again)....appar<br />      emerged unscathed which <br />      sowed seeds of doubt into the kings mind... each of<br />      these episodes are <br />      beautifully sung in tamil verse by appar ( its not<br />      for nothing that he <br />      is called navukkuarasar - the king of the tongue)</p>
<p>      inorder to clear the doubt about which faith was<br />      stronger mahendra <br />      engaged appar with a debate with the jain<br />      monks...both argued for long <br />      without any clear winner emerging...finally they<br />      agreed to a <br />      test...wherein each wrote a verse in palm leaf and<br />      threw it into a <br />      fire....appar's emerged unscathed but the jain work<br />      perished...this <br />      made mahendra convert back to shivism ....and not<br />      much publisised but <br />      has to be admitted - a brutal attack at wiping out<br />      the jain faith in <br />      tamil land...which included impaling them on stakes<br />      ( kazuvil <br />      ettruthal), mass murder - leaving their bodies to be<br />      consumed by dogs <br />      and foxs...etc. all these are also sung...the king<br />      also destroyed a <br />      large number of jain schools and places of worship </p>
<p>      this is a very significant and turning point in<br />      tamil land, if not for <br />      this - i would have had to sign off as vijay<br />      jain....</p>

<p>  So to my knowledge as of now the most popular<br />  Avvaiyar did not live in<br />  period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was atleast 2<br />  centuries after<br />  Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.</p>
<p>  Probably the base to such legend would have been the<br />  Saiva,Jain<br />  ,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar<br />  threw some poetry on<br />  palm leaves into the river...to see which one came<br />  back to shore and<br />  which left to prove the religions supremacy...</p>
<p>  Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come<br />  across any critical<br />  study I will surely post it here!</p>

<p>    Vairam, who was the real author of 'kongu ther<br />    vazhkai'? Also is there some truth to legend about<br />    'Tirukkural' also - that it was thrown into<br />  potramarai<br />    kulam and later came up on a golden lotus? (That<br />  is<br />    how it is depicted in the movie Avvaiyar.</p>
<p>    Thanks!!</p>

        <p>This is really a very hot debatable subject with<br />little or no answers. Vairam, am sure you have heard<br />of a God that is non religious, the God speaken about<br />by great poets like Rumi, Kabir, and even the 'katru<br />veliyidai kannamma' was not a religious God, they sang<br />about the universal spirit that is beyond religions<br />and partisan differences.</p>
<p>People have to live with the times they were in. I<br />suppose (I may be wrong) Appar could not call on help<br />(police/army/someone) when he was thrown into sunnabu<br />kalavai or ill treated otherwise. But being a saint I<br />would assume he could have asked Mahendra Pallava to<br />forgive his tormentors (I would not expect that of a<br />normal person).</p>
<p>There are no answers to some of these questions, I<br />like Appar's poetry really does not mean I should<br />condone all that he did, that is all.</p>

<p>    Thank you Vijay for the most interesting<br />  historical<br />    anecdote. Some historical incidents are too gory<br />  to<br />    even imagine, I often think of the PS episode<br />  where<br />    Veerapandiyan's head is impaled on a pole. </p>
<p>    I don't know really if that meant survival of<br />  Hinduism<br />    since compassion is at the heart of our faith. I<br />  know<br />    many jains too, of course, modern people but they<br />  are<br />    very kind, tolerant, sweet people. To me I'd<br />  rather<br />    say it was something people had to do in those<br />  times<br />    when society was not as evolved and leave it at<br />    that.Undoubtedly though reduced my respect for<br />    Mahendra Pallava.</p>

<p>      Hi vairam</p>
<p>      The legend is appar engaged jains in a debate in<br />      front of mahendra <br />      pallava. the test was not floating palm leaves<br />  on<br />      water but a test of <br />      fire..</p>
<p>      This happens after appar's reconversion back (<br />  born<br />      as marul <br />      neeikiyaar - into jain faith as dharmasenar and<br />  then<br />      into the shivaite <br />      faith as tiru navukkarasar ...fondly called as<br />  appar<br />      by gyana <br />      sambandar) - the king himself into the jain<br />  faith,<br />      was goaded by the <br />      jain monks fearing the retribution of a popular<br />  jain<br />      monk embracing <br />      shivism...led the king to subject appar to many<br />      tortures - incl being <br />      confined into a cell for a week without food or<br />      water, being poisoned, <br />      trying be crushed under an elephants foot and<br />  then<br />      finally being tied <br />      to a stone and dropped into the sea....( dont<br />  want<br />      to take the <br />      comparison to the dasavataram again)....appar<br />      emerged unscathed which <br />      sowed seeds of doubt into the kings mind... each<br />  of<br />      these episodes are <br />      beautifully sung in tamil verse by appar ( its<br />  not<br />      for nothing that he <br />      is called navukkuarasar - the king of the<br />  tongue)</p>
<p>      inorder to clear the doubt about which faith was<br />      stronger mahendra <br />      engaged appar with a debate with the jain<br />      monks...both argued for long <br />      without any clear winner emerging...finally they<br />      agreed to a <br />      test...wherein each wrote a verse in palm leaf<br />  and<br />      threw it into a <br />      fire....appar's emerged unscathed but the jain<br />  work<br />      perished...this <br />      made mahendra convert back to shivism ....and<br />  not<br />      much publisised but <br />      has to be admitted - a brutal attack at wiping<br />  out<br />      the jain faith in <br />      tamil land...which included impaling them on<br />  stakes<br />      ( kazuvil <br />      ettruthal), mass murder - leaving their bodies<br />  to be<br />      consumed by dogs <br />      and foxs...etc. all these are also sung...the<br />  king<br />      also destroyed a <br />      large number of jain schools and places of<br />  worship </p>
<p>      this is a very significant and turning point in<br />      tamil land, if not for <br />      this - i would have had to sign off as vijay<br />      jain....</p>

<p>the Koon pandiyan and his queen mangayarkarasi. Appar's trials and <br />tribulations resulted in the Mahendra pallavan converting back to <br />Saivism but not in large scale conversion or torture of <br />Jain/Buddhists. Also my theory would be that since Pulikesi could <br />have support of jains, mahendra pallavan could have converted to <br />saivism to garner more support from the traditional saivite country <br />of southern tamilnadu.</p>

<p>Hi nanda</p>
<p>You are right, but both sambandar and appar were contemporaries. <br />infact there are references of appar staying with managayarkarasi <br />and pandya in their palace in madurai.Agree that the said acts were <br />recorded more in pandya country, however please read this ref  <br />Regarding the king destroying jain schools:</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Vijay/Vairam,<br />Are we confusing too many legends into one? Sambandar episode is the one where jain monks are impaled at the end of it, that too by the Koon pandiyan and his queen mangayarkarasi. Appar's trials and tribulations resulted in the Mahendra pallavan converting back to Saivism but not in large scale conversion or torture of Jain/Buddhists. Also my theory would be thatsince Pulikesi could have support of jains, mahendra pallavan could have converted to saivism to garner more support from the traditional saivite country of southern tamilnadu.<br />Regards<br />Nanda</p>

<p>Hi vairam</p>
<p>The legend is appar engaged jains in a debate in front of mahendra <br />pallava. the test was not floating palm leaves on water but a test of <br />fire...</p>
<p>This happens after appar's reconversion back ( born as marul <br />neeikiyaar - into jain faith as dharmasenar and then into the shivaite <br />faith as tiru navukkarasar ...fondly called as appar by gyana <br />sambandar) - the king himself into the jain faith, was goaded by the <br />jain monks fearing the retribution of a popular jain monk embracing <br />shivism...led the king to subject appar to many tortures - incl being <br />confined into a cell for a week without food or water, being poisoned, <br />trying be crushed under an elephants foot and then finally being tied <br />to a stone and dropped into the sea....( dont want to take the <br />comparison to the dasavataram again)....appar emerged unscathed which <br />sowed seeds of doubt into the kings mind... each of these episodes are <br />beautifully sung in tamil verse by appar ( its not for nothing that he <br />is called navukkuarasar - the king of the tongue)</p>
<p>inorder to clear the doubt about which faith was stronger mahendra <br />engaged appar with a debate with the jain monks...both argued for long <br />without any clear winner emerging...finally they agreed to a <br />test...wherein each wrote a verse in palm leaf and threw it into a <br />fire.....appar' s emerged unscathed but the jain work perished...this <br />made mahendra convert back to shivism ....and not much publisised but <br />has to be admitted - a brutal attack at wiping out the jain faith in <br />tamil land...which included impaling them on stakes ( kazuvil <br />ettruthal), mass murder - leaving their bodies to be consumed by dogs <br />and foxs...etc. all these are also sung...the king also destroyed a <br />large number of jain schools and places of worship </p>
<p>this is a very significant and turning point in tamil land, if not for <br />this - i would have had to sign off as vijay jain.....</p>

        <p>Hi,<br />sorry for my ignorance...if you give more information on 'Kongu ther<br />vazhkai' I will try to find it out.<br />Sorry once more about my ignorance , i dont know about the<br />Thriukural legend too.</p>
<p>When it comes to Thirukkural and Avvaiyar, i dont see any period<br />where they would have lived together. Though Tamil Nadu government has<br />gone ahead and said Thiruvalluvar was born thirty years before chirst,<br />all literary scholars and historians date Thirukural any where between<br />5th to 10th century. The most closest dating would be around the 5-6th<br />century(didactic age).<br />Avvaiyar....there are many Avvaiyars ... The poet in Sangam<br />literature who sings of Atiyaman Anci and many other poems might be<br />different form Avvaiyars of Later periods. Avvaiyar and Agastya are<br />the two most common people whose name has been linked to every other<br />work.(Even in legends of thiruvilayadal which is work around 14th<br />century). I have not come across any critical study specific to<br />Avvaiyar, but Dr.Zvelebil says there are many Nakkirars and Avvaiyars<br />in Tamil poetry.<br />The Nakkiarar who wrote poems in Purananuru is different from<br />Nakkirar who wrote commentry to Iraivanar Agaporul. If you ask<br />question how can you find that?...its not easy for us...but literary<br />scholars and linguist have specific methods.... with each century the<br />language attains some changes, so the compare the poems of the Two<br />Nakkirars in question. The check the style, language usage,allusions<br />employed etc. if its close enough and if the dating of two works are<br />close enough they accept it as a single author. But if there is<br />drastic change in usage of language , if there are loan words which<br />cannot be ascribed to certain period etc they come to conclusion that<br />they are work of two different poets....(only manirathanam can take a<br />manirathanam movie...Perarasu if he changes his name to Manirathanam<br />and directs a movie...people can surely recogonise that its surely not<br />Manirathanams movie!)</p>
<p>So to my knowledge as of now the most popular Avvaiyar did not live in<br />period of Thiruvalluvar. Thiruvalluvar was atleast 2 centuries after<br />Avvaiyar. So I dont know how the legend works.</p>
<p>Probably the base to such legend would have been the Saiva,Jain<br />,Bhuddist debates....where many saints like Appar threw some poetry on<br />palm leaves into the river...to see which one came back to shore and<br />which left to prove the religions supremacy...</p>
<p>Again these are my guesses as of now. If I come across any critical<br />study I will surely post it here!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Vairam, who was the real author of 'kongu ther<br />  vazhkai'? Also is there some truth to legend about<br />  'Tirukkural' also - that it was thrown into potramarai<br />  kulam and later came up on a golden lotus? (That is<br />  how it is depicted in the movie Avvaiyar.</p>

        <p>Vairam, who was the real author of 'kongu ther<br />vazhkai'? Also is there some truth to legend about<br />'Tirukkural' also - that it was thrown into potramarai<br />kulam and later came up on a golden lotus? (That is<br />how it is depicted in the movie Avvaiyar.</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

        <p>I would also like to point out the one fact from Tolkappiyam,<br />Tolkappiyam says there are 12 regional dialects and they were called<br />Koduntamil. Pure Tamil was spoken only in one region and it was region<br />around present day Madurai.</p>
<p>So historically, Tamil and Madurai have been associated for long time<br />and from as early as 350 BC we know that Pandiyas were ruling that area.</p>
<p>What ever the true history is...we cannot erase the Idea about Sangam<br />from peoples mind....Nagesh and Sivaji were too Awesome!!!!</p>

<p>    lovely vairam, great work</p>
<p>    you have a mention of the sinnamanur plate - its a very interesting<br />    plate (it incl my favorite subject....the indira haram - is denoted<br />    as taking away - not given ??) and also solves my earlier question<br />    on the pandya fish banner - it was always two fishes i guess!!!</p>
<p>    The Tamil portion which begins with line 76 also praises the Pandya<br />    kings who belonged to the lunar race and bore the crest of the<br />    double fish, had Agastya as their family preceptor and counted the<br />    god (Siva) as one of the their family members. Many other<br />    incidents, mostly mythical, are also registered of some of the early<br />    kings : such as,</p>
<p>    (1) churning the ocean for nectar ;     (2) bathing in the waters of the four oceans in a single day ;     (3) going round the earth ;     (4) sending embassy to the gods on many occasions;     (5) taking away the necklace of Pakasasana (Indra) ;     (6) mastering the Tamil language of the south ;     (7) driving away the sea by throwing a javelin ;     (8) giving a thousand golden hills (Meru) in charity ;     (9) founding the town of Madura and erecting a wall round it ; (10)<br />    studying Tamil and Sanskrit (vada-moli) as even to excel Pandits ;     (11) leading elephants in the Bharata war against the Maharathas ;     (12) relieving Vijaya (Arjuna) from the curse of vasu ;     (13) engraving the victorious symbols of the fish, the tiger, and<br />    the bow on the top of the Northern mountain, i.e., the Himalayas ;     (14) getting huge giants to work for them in building many tanks ;     (15) cutting off the heads of two kings in the battles fought at<br />    Chitramayari and Talaiyalanganam ;     (16) getting the Mahabharata translated into Tamil ; and<br />    (17) establishing the Tamil Sangam in the town of Madura.</p></vj.episteme@></p></blockquote>

<p>  lovely vairam, great work</p>
<p>  you have a mention of the sinnamanur plate - its a very interesting<br />  plate (it incl my favorite subject....the indira haram - is denoted<br />  as taking away - not given ??) and also solves my earlier question<br />  on the pandya fish banner - it was always two fishes i guess!!!</p>
<p>  The Tamil portion which begins with line 76 also praises the Pandya<br />  kings who belonged to the lunar race and bore the crest of the<br />  double fish, had Agastya as their family preceptor and counted the<br />  god (Siva) as one of the their family members. Many other<br />  incidents, mostly mythical, are also registered of some of the early<br />  kings : such as,</p>
<p>  (1) churning the ocean for nectar ;   (2) bathing in the waters of the four oceans in a single day ;   (3) going round the earth ;   (4) sending embassy to the gods on many occasions;   (5) taking away the necklace of Pakasasana (Indra) ;   (6) mastering the Tamil language of the south ;   (7) driving away the sea by throwing a javelin ;   (8) giving a thousand golden hills (Meru) in charity ;   (9) founding the town of Madura and erecting a wall round it ; (10)<br />  studying Tamil and Sanskrit (vada-moli) as even to excel Pandits ;   (11) leading elephants in the Bharata war against the Maharathas ;   (12) relieving Vijaya (Arjuna) from the curse of vasu ;   (13) engraving the victorious symbols of the fish, the tiger, and<br />  the bow on the top of the Northern mountain, i.e., the Himalayas ;   (14) getting huge giants to work for them in building many tanks ;   (15) cutting off the heads of two kings in the battles fought at<br />  Chitramayari and Talaiyalanganam ;   (16) getting the Mahabharata translated into Tamil ; and<br />  (17) establishing the Tamil Sangam in the town of Madura.</p>

          Tamil Sangam - Facts and Ficiton        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>If you have gone through the 2nd part of my article - the adaptation of Brahmi for Tamil and grammarization is impossible for a single man to do:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It is revealing that Tolkappiyam places&nbsp; r, &nbsp;n ,&nbsp; l and&nbsp; ? at the end of the series of stops, nasals and liquids ( Tol Elu 19-21 ). This arrangement deviates from the order based on articulatory phonetics. This small but significant detail indicates that the four special letters were originally regarded as additions to the alphabet taken over from Brahmi. The additional letter n &nbsp;isalso described as the last in the Tamil alphabet.<br />&nbsp;</p>
