</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi Ram,</p>
<p>Your articel in varalaaru about GNB is excellent. Though I dont know <br />abc of music, your article struck me with awe. Heard about GNB a <br />lot, but got a chance for the first time to know something about <br />him. </p>
<p>I have a doubt for a long time. When did the carnatic music arena <br />hijacked by Telugu keerthanais. Becuase music is there from time <br />immorial and our people have been singing lots of songs all these <br />years. Why a sudden change in the past 100 years? I would say tamil <br />keerthanais take the last seat during any katcheri. I think even <br />during the 1880 or 1890's tamil songs were being sung. I think <br />Nandanar sarithiram and other prasangams were at its peak.<br />How come within a few decades, say from 1890 to 1930 or 40 Telugu <br />keerthanais gained prominance?</p>
<p>Do you or anyone in the group have any idea? Please enlighten me. Is <br />it somthing like - our people are always fascinated by outside <br />things than the internals. Foreign products are valued more than <br />indian brands..anything on the same lines? Just wondering...</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

          GNB        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Ram,<br />This is Chandrasekaran. Hope you remember me and Uma my sister <br />accompanying you all to the recent Tanjai big trip. I quote big because <br />you all are frequent visitors who have lost count.<br />I read your reply on GNB matter. When you quoted..<br />``The same can be said abt. the Shankarabaranam sung by Vijay Shiva. My <br />eyes were filled with tears when he sang "thookiya thiruvadi thuNaiyena <br />nambinen", a Sudhdhanandha bharathi song during the pradhosha <br />evening..."</p>
<p>Me, my sister and all my family members must have been really, I think -<br />must have swept floors in some good temple in our Poorvajanmam. For <br />which, we are the family members of the great Shuddhanandha Bharati. <br />Unlike many of today's so-called saints, he was unique, and a <br />multifaceted personality. The intorduction has been added seperately in <br />the files section, as this would become tooo long a mail.<br />My reason for writing this is not only the above said song, many more <br />like ..</p>
<p>GNB's (Purvikalyani Raag) -Karanam Kettu Vaadi, and <br />Jankara Shruti Seiguvaal, Abayakarathai Parka PArtha podhu acham <br />ozhindhen sivamey, Varuvano Vanakkuyiley, Kuyile unakku Kodinamaskaram <br />(sung in cinemas), Arul purivaai Karunai Kadale, kadalellam kollai <br />kondai kanna kanna, sakalkala vaaniye, Asai konden Vandey,(MS <br />Subbulakshmi), Kuzalosai Ketkudamma, Idaya Veli thanil (NT <br />Vasanthakokilam), DK Pattammal's Eppadi paadinaro, Ananda Natanam <br />Adinaar, Seergazhi's - Siriputhaan Varugudaiyaa, Bayappadadiru manamey, <br />Enakkena Manakavalai, Urigiduvaai Maname,Unni krishnan's - Brindavanam <br />iduvo kanna vilayadi ullathai kollai konda, Sudha Raghunathan's and <br />U.krishnan rendering - Kannane En KaNavan..etc. <br />and many more not only were in enriched Tamil but also were very <br />touching in word and meaning. Also, unlike other Ashram folks, Swamiji <br />didnt capitalize on his rich forte' but gave away many manuscripts and <br />songs to people left and right. But our family have been successful in <br />making him live and attain samadhi in peace, in Sholapuram, near <br />Sivagangai, (SPS @ SB sir visited recently with his family) and now we <br />are trying all sorts to retain his lost glory and fame, and telling the <br />world that many of the above works are really of Swamiji and not by <br />Subrmania Bharati or any others. Also, we are successful in running a <br />school for rural children upto 10th standard solely on meagre <br />govt.salaries. and no external funds. Also the samaj conversion to a <br />museum, the science lab, and many more projects to be taken on war <br />footing. We have started conducting medical camps to the children, and <br />many more regular activities after me and my brother decided to come <br />back to Chennai after a long hybernation ( means- jobs in Mumbai, <br />Baroda and my brother in London). Now as a joint family and also from <br />support from all earning members in the family, we have also started a <br />yahoo group within family members to plan and activate Shuddhanandha <br />Bharati ideals and name propoganda.</p>
<p>We gave cassettes to all <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group members who came for the Tanjai trip. <br />All songs are part of those sung in Swamiji's school. For seperate <br />keerthananjali book I can give them for any one interested whose <br />proceeds will go to the school corpus fund.<br />There are TAMIL songs aplenty and our family is willing to even record <br />them in any poular voice or upcoming artiste with all the frills like <br />orchestra, recording, audition etc. etc. Any suggestion and link to <br />musicians welcome. If Ram wants to take up such cassette project, I <br />will get him prior permission to do so. I remember him singing vividly, <br />but within himself in the Brahadeeswara Temple. I drew close to him to <br />hear the song, but could not hear fully. I knew he had great <br />inclination towards Carnatic song, but was awestruck, with his blog on <br />dec. festival. Any more queries - welcome! Sorry, for making <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group <br />members go- off track to elaborate on Shuddhananda Bharati. The <br />opportunity came and I didn't want to miss it.<br />Nandriyudan,<br />Chandrasekaran</acronym></acronym></p>

        <p>Dear All<br />I am a novice in carnatic music<br />but i have heard that thygaraja's grandfather (maternal) was a great <br />composer himself.worked in serfoji's palace.<br />and he laid the foundation for a wonderful creative and artistic <br />climate at tanjore court.<br />is it true. <br />ram can you enlighten us?<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>

<p>singing. There were minimal or no renditions of kirthanams. Our <br />history has only a list of composers starting from purandaradasa, <br />kshetrangja, tamil trinity and in the latter half of 18th century <br />came the 'carnatic trinity'. Telugu being his mother tongue he <br />composed several songs in telugu. But why did they become popular <br />when compared to his predecessors whoa composed in <br />tamil/sanskrit/kannada?</p>

Both were disciples of Thyagaraja's direct <br />disciple based in Manambuchaavadi. The most popular musicians of the <br />next generations like Ramnad poochi srinivasa iyengar, Ariyakudi <br />Ramanuja Iyengar belong to this lineage. (while the former was a <br />disciple of patnam, ariyakudi was the disciple of Poochi). Because of <br />this, we dont just have Thyagaraja's compositions on paper (as in <br />just the lyrics) but we actually know the way it was done. <br />Thyagaraja's sishyas did take pain to notate and document many of his <br />kirthanas and thanks to people like Bangalore Nagarathnammal and <br />Ranga Ramanuja iyengar it became public info.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The same cannot be said abt. other composers. Today we may have <br />Arunachala Kavi's "rama nataka kirthanais". But, hardly anybody know </p></blockquote>
<p>how it was composed. Pieces like devaram and prabandham were <br />considered not to be fit for singing in kutcheri's. U.Ve.Sa has <br />written a book called "sangeetha mummanigaL". In that one of the maNi <br />is "maha vaishyanatha sivan". Being a staunch siva devotee, he would <br />sing devaram for several hours a day sitting inside his pooja room or <br />sitting in his house's thiNNai for the benefit of the listeners, but <br />would never sing it in a concert, as he thought it was unappropriate. <br />That was the mind set even in the beginning of 20th century.</p>
<blockquote><p>  When kutcheris started becoming more professional, thanks to the <br />sabhas formed, there were several audience with several tastes. </p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, there was a big demand for tamil krithis. Being <br />professionals, singers did dig deep to unearth several tamil krithis <br />and seven before the tamil isai movement, which started in late 30's <br />there were several people singing tamil krithis. However, tamil <br />krithis are not readily available as thyagaraja krithis and it <br />requires a little bit of genius like Ariyakudi, GNB, Semmangudi et. <br />al. to bring a new krithi without compromising on the quality.</p>
<blockquote><p>  I think Thyagaraja, for all the simple and dedicated life he lead, <br />had a wealth of disciples, who made it a point to popularize his </p></blockquote>
<p>krithis and no other composer enjoyed such status. If not for MLV we <br />will not have many of the Purandaradasa Kirthanas. If not for <br />Ariyakudi we will not be waking up with thiruppavai hymns during <br />maargazhi. In fact, there is an interesting article by Subhramanya <br />Bharathiyar titled "sangeetha vishayam". In which, he mentions that, <br />even in thyagaraja krithis, singers repeatedly sing only a handful <br />like "raama nee samaana", "chakkani raaja" etc. It was only after the <br />advent of folks like GNB, the rarer and exquisite krithis of <br />thyagaraja came into vogue.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Tamil krthis did take a backseat a few decades back. But today, <br />thanks to many maestros and tamil isai movement, there is a </p></blockquote>
<p>considerable amount of tamil krithis sung as main pieces in a <br />concert.

There are abt. 30 krithis composed by <br />thyagaraja only. The same can be said abt. the Shankarabaranam sung <br />by Vijay Shiva. My eyes were filled with tears when he sang "thookiya <br />thiruvadi thuNaiyena nambinen", a sudhdhanandha bharathi song during <br />the pradhosha evening. It is not that tamil krithis are not sung. But <br />the ratio of well set krithis is say 10:1 and it is not an easy task <br />to unearth a new krithi. The past 50 years have been only on the <br />positive side for tamil krithis and future looks only brighter.</p>

<p>  Hi Ram,</p>
<p>  Your articel in varalaaru about GNB is excellent. Though I dont <br />know <br />  abc of music, your article struck me with awe. Heard about GNB a <br />  lot, but got a chance for the first time to know something about <br />  him. </p>
<p>  I have a doubt for a long time. When did the carnatic music arena <br />  hijacked by Telugu keerthanais. Becuase music is there from time <br />  immorial and our people have been singing lots of songs all these <br />  years. Why a sudden change in the past 100 years? I would say tamil <br />  keerthanais take the last seat during any katcheri. I think even <br />  during the 1880 or 1890's tamil songs were being sung. I think <br />  Nandanar sarithiram and other prasangams were at its peak.<br />  How come within a few decades, say from 1890 to 1930 or 40 Telugu <br />  keerthanais gained prominance?</p>
<p>  Do you or anyone in the group have any idea? Please enlighten me. <br />Is <br />  it somthing like - our people are always fascinated by outside <br />  things than the internals. Foreign products are valued more than <br />  indian brands..anything on the same lines? Just wondering...</p>

        <p>I prefer Tamil keerthanaigal, as we can easily understand the <br />meaning and sing them. </p>
<p>The trend has changed now.</p>
<p>After the Pancharatna composition of Tyagarajar, peopel approached <br />Gopala krishna bharathi, for a similar songs. He had composed them <br />all in same raga. Not many know about this.</p>
<p>When Gopalakrishna bharathi, was in Mayiladuthurai, he once went to <br />see Tyagaraja. Tyagaraja was in late years of his age, and they had <br />a good chat. When Tyagaraja, enquired about a sing GKB, composed in <br />Abhogi, GKB has said no. That night GKB, went hom and composed a <br />song in Abhogi, and that was ' Sabaaabathiku Verudheivam..'.</p>
<p>He sung that the next day to Tyagaraja, and they were in Bliss. <br />Musicians, without jealousy and envy are hard to find.</p>
<p>Long live Tamil music.</p>

        <p>dear all<br />telugus have played a great role in temil culture.<br />when the original agmark tamil culture was wiped out with the demise <br />of the muvendar and the installation of the madurai sultanate a <br />telugu invasion re installed hinduism in this part of the country.<br />some of our best temples including madurai and chidambaram have been <br />rebuilt during telugu times. <br />a substantial part of our population still has telugu as a mother <br />toungue. so no wonder carnatic music was famous with telugu lyrics.<br />arasan evvaliyO makkal avvaliyE<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>
