<p>Dear Readers, <br />The original Sanskrit Mahabharatha written by Sage - Viyasa, has many <br />references on the Tamil Royal Dynasties, and on the Tamil Countries <br />of South India and their geographical locations within, that were <br />known during the period of the Mahabharatha, which I trust will be of <br />much interest to the research - scholars and students of Tamil <br />History and append below same to their benefit. </p>
<p>I have selected the version of Mahabharatha translated into English <br />Prose by "Mr Kisari Mohan Ganguli" from the original Sanskrit Text of <br />Sage Viysa, and published by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers (Pvt) <br />Ltd, New Delhi, India, from which the following have been extracted. </p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------ </p>
<p>[1] ".......Dhritarashtra (i.ee.Thiritarasra) said, `Hear O Sanjaya <br />the celestial feeats of Vasudeva feats that Govinda achieved and the <br />like of which no otheer person hath ever been able to <br />achieve......The mighty Krishna also slew the valiant king of <br />Chedis.......all these he vanquished in battle. The Avantis......the <br />Cholas, the Pandyas......as also Sakas, and the Yavanas with <br />followers were all vanquished by him ........' </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - DRONA PARVA, PAGE 23. </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Pandyas in a battle prior to Baratha war. </p>
<p>[2] "........When that host was being thus struck and slain by heroic <br />warriors, the Parthas headed by Vrikodara advance against us. They <br />consisted of Dhrishtayumna and Sikhandin, and the five sons of <br />Draupadi, and the Prabhadrakes, and Satyaki, and Chekitana with the <br />Dravida forces, and the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas, <br />surrounded by a mighty array, all possessed of broad chests, long <br />arms, tall statures an large eyes. Decked with ornaments, possessed <br />of red teeth, endued with the prowess of infuriate elephants, attired <br />in robes of diverse colours, smeared with powere scents, armed with <br />swords and nooses, capable of restraining mightty elephants, <br />companions in death, and never eserting one other, equipped with <br />quivers, bearing bows adorne with long locks, an agreeable in speech <br />were the combatants of the infantry files led by Sayaki, belonging to <br />Andhra tribe, retinue with fierce forms and great energy. Other brave <br />warriors such as the Chedis, the Panchalas, the Kaikayas, the <br />Karushas, the Kosalas, the Kanchis, and the Maghadhas also rushed <br />forward........" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - KARNA PARVA, PAGE 25. KULUTAS PAGE 26 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Cheras, the Kanchi undoubtedly the Thondaimandala kings whose capital <br />was at Kanchi. all fought on the side of the Pandavas. </p>
<p>[3] ".......I behold the Ganga, the Satudru, the Sita, the Yamuna, <br />and the Kausiki, the Charmanwati, the Vetravati, the Chandrabaga, the <br />Saraswati, the Sindhu, the Vipasa, and the Godavari, the Vaswokasara, <br />the Nalini and the Narmada, the Tamara, and the Venna also of <br />delightful current and sacred waters, the Suvenna, the Krishna-venna, <br />the Irama,and the Mahanadi, the Vitasti, O great king and that large <br />river Cavery, the one also O tiger ! among men the Visalya and the <br />Kimpuna also......" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 381. </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Cavery river would have been very wide with more flow of water as the <br />pronoun "large river" is only used to river Cavery, when many of the <br />other rivers of India was being referred simply as rivers in <br />Mahabaratha. The above also describes of the warrirors from the Tamil <br />countries and of their forces ,valour and armoury. </p>
<p>[4] "Markandeya said `O bull of the Bharata race even Rama suffered <br />unparalled misery, for the evil minded Ravana king of Rakshasas, <br />having recourse to deceit and overpowering the vulture Jatayu <br />forcibly carried away his wife Sita from his asylum in the woods. <br />Indeed Rama with the help of Sugriva brought her back, constructing a <br />bridge across the sea, and consuming Lanka with his keen-edged <br />arrows........" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 533 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />undergone by kings prior to Pandavas refers to the Rama and Ravana <br />story being the Ramayana. Hence it is very clear Mahabaratha war took <br />place after tthe Ramayana story. </p>
<p>[5] ".......then going to the south Karna vanquished the mighty <br />charioteers and in Dakshinatya the Suta's son entered into conflict <br />with Rukmi.......Having met with Rukmi, Karna repaired to Pandya and <br />the mountain Sri. And by fighting he made Karala(Kerala ??) king <br />Nila, Venudari's son and other best of kings living in the southern <br />direction pay tribute....." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 502 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />country and the Kerala country down the southern region of India and <br />exacted tributes from them. </p>
<p>[6] "......The river Indus, the five rivers (of the Punjab) the Sone, <br />the Devika the Saraswati, the Ganga, the Satakumba, the Sarayu, the <br />Ganaki, the Charmanwati, the Mahi, the Medha, the Medhatithi the <br />three rivers Tamravati the Vetravati and the Kausiki, the Tamasa the <br />Narmada, the Godavari, the Vena the Upavena, the Bhima, the Vadawa <br />the Bharati the Suprayoga, the Kaveri, the Murmura the Tungavenna, <br />the Krishnavenna and the Kapila these rivers O Bharatha ! are said to <br />be the mothers of the fires......." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 451/52 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Here too reference is made to the river Kaveri flowing through the <br />Chola </p>
<p>[7] Krishnavenna ".......Kshatriyas assembled in that amphitheatre, <br />each desirous of winning of winning the daughter of Drupatha those <br />princes Karna, Duryodhana, Salwa, Salya, Aswatthaman, Kratha, <br />Sunitha, Vakra, the ruler of Kalinga, and Banga, Pandiya Paundra, the <br />ruler of Videha, the chief of the Yavanas, and many other sons and <br />grandsons of kings, sovereigns of territories with eyes like lotus <br />petals, one after another began to exhibit prowess for (winning) that <br />maiden of unrivalled beauty....." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, ADIPARVA, PAGE 373/374 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />were among many others who exhibited their prowess to win the <br />princess Draupathi at the Suyamvaram festivity. </p>
<p>[8] "........O king there are also four oceans, the river <br />Bhagirathee, the Kalindi, the Vidisa, the Venwa, the Narmada of rapid <br />current, the Vipasa, the Satadu, the Chandrabhaga, the Saraswati, the <br />Iravati, the Vitasta, the Sindu, the Devanadi, the Godavari, <br />Krishnavenwa, and that queen of rivers the Kaveri......." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 21 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Here too it is evident that during the days of Mahabaratha the river <br />Kaveri which flowed through the Chola country was held in high esteem <br />by the North Indians among all other rivers of India. </p>
<p>[9] ".......the son of Pandu (Sahadeva)........the hero brought under <br />his subjection and exacted tributes from Paundrayas and the Dravidas <br />along with the Udrakeralas and the Andhras and the Talavanas the <br />Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas and also the delightful city of Atavi <br />and that of Yavanas......." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 65/66 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />exaced tributes from Dravidas and the kings of north Kerala. </p>
<p>[10] ".......O bull of the Bharata race having heard of king <br />Yudhishthura's sacrifice hundreds of other Kshatriyas acquainted with <br />the nature of the sacrifice with joyous hearts came there from <br />various countries,........the kings of Vanga and Kalinga, and Akastha <br />and Kuntala, and the kings of Malavas and the Andhrakas and the <br />Dravidas and the Singhalas and the king of Kashmira........" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABHAPARVA, PAGE 70/71 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />We note from the above to attend the Yuthistra's sacrifice (Yaga) <br />among many who came were the Dravidas and the Singhalas of Sri Lanka <br />too have came. </p>
<p>[11] ".....and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avant Pandya......" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 86 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />A reference is made to a Pandiya king </p>
<p>[12] ".......Duryodhana said O sinless one listen to me as I describe <br />that large mass of wealth consisting of various kinds of tribute <br />presented unto Yudhishthira by the kings of the earth......the kings <br />of Chola and Pandya though they brought numberless jars of gold <br />filled with fragrant sandal juice from the hills of Malaya, and loads <br />of sandal and the aloe wood from the Dardduras hills and many gems of <br />great brilliancy and fine cloths inlaid with gold didnot obtain <br />permission to enter, and the king of the Singhalas gave those best of <br />sea-born gems called the lapis lazuli and heaps of pearls also and <br />hundreds of coverlets for elephants. And numberless dark-coloured men <br />with the ends of their eyes red as copper attired in cloths decked <br />with gems waited at the gate with those presents......" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 105 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Cholas the Pandyas and the Sinhalas from Sri Lanka brought to king <br />Yuthistra as present on the occasion of the great Yaga conducted by <br />him. </p>
<p>[13] ".......and even Krishna himself.......addressing Yudhishthira <br />said That prosperity which the sons of Pritha had acquired at <br />Indraprastha and which unobtainable by other kings was beheld by me <br />at the Rajasuya sacrifice at which besides I saw all kings even those <br />of the Vangas and Angas and Paundras and Odras and Cholas and <br />Dravidas and Andhakas and the chiefs of many islands and countries on <br />the sea-board as also of frontier states including the rulers of the <br />Sinhalas, the barbarous Mlecchas, the natives of Lanka, and all the <br />kings of the west by hundreds, and all the chiefs of the sea-coast, <br />and the kings of the Pahlavas and the Daradas and the various tribes <br />of the Kiratas and Yavanas and Sakras and the Harahunas and <br />Chinas ........" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATHA - BY K.M.GANGULI VANAPARVA, PAGE 110 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Krishna himself personally saw the Cholas, Dravidas, and the Sinhalas <br />being present at the Yaga sacrifice which he confirmed to Yuthistra. </p>
<p>[14] "........Proceeding next to the mountain Rishabha in Pandya <br />worshipped by the gods, one obtains the merit of the Vajpeya <br />sacrifice and rejoices in heaven. One should next proceed to the <br />river Kaveri, frequented by Apsaras. Bathing there O monarch ! and <br />obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Touching next the <br />waters of the tirtha called Kanya on the shores of the sea one is <br />cleansed from every sin. Proceeding next to Gokarna celebrated over <br />the three worlds and which is situate O best of kings ! in the midst <br />of the deep (sea ??? - Trincomalee of Sri Lanka???)and referenced by <br />all the worlds........worship the lord of Uma, one should worship <br />Isana, fasting there for three nights. By this he acquireth the merit <br />of the horse-sacrifce and the status of Gnapatya by staying there for <br />twelve nights one's soul is clensed of all sins........" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 192 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Here we note the description of the mountain in the Pandya country, <br />about the river Kaveri, the thirtha the Kanyakumari, and Gokarna it <br />seems to refer to the modern Thirukkoneswaram in north-east Sri <br />Lanka, a Shiva shrine. </p>
<p>[15] "......Dhaumya continued, Listen O Bharata I shall now narrate <br />to thee in detail according to my knowledge the sacred tirthas of the <br />south......O Yudhishthira in the country of the Pandyas are the <br />tirthas named Agastya and Varuna ! and O bull among men there amongst <br />the Pandavas is the thirtha called Kumaris. Listen O son of Kunti I <br />shall now describe Tamraparni. In that asylum the gods had undergone <br />penances impelled by the desire of obtaining salvation. In that <br />region also is the lake of Gokarna which is celebrated over the three <br />worlds hath an abundance of cool waters and is sacred auspicious and <br />capable O child of producing great merit. That lake is extremely <br />difficult of access to men of unpurified souls. Near to that thirtha <br />is the sacred asylum of Agastya's disciple the mountain Devasabha <br />which abounds in trees and grass and friuts and roots. And there also <br />is the Vaiduryya mountain which is delightful abounding in gems <br />capable of bestowing great merit. There on that mountain is the <br />asylum of Agastya abounding in friuts roots and water.......' </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 200/201 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Here a description is given on the sacred Thirthas of the Pandya <br />country the Agastya the Varuna the Gokarna of the mountains Devasabha <br />and Vaidurya that were known during the Mahabaratha days. </p>
<p>[16] "........Radha's son of the Suta caste, an those mighty car-<br />warriors who were his brothers,an the Kaikeyas, the Mallavas, the <br />Madrakas the Dravidas of fierce prowress, the Yaudheyas, the <br />Lalittyas, the Kshudrakas, the Usinaras, the Tundikeras, the <br />Savitriputras, the Easterners, the Northerners, the Westerners and <br />the southerners, O sire, have all been slain by Savyasachin......." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - KARNA PARVA, PAGE 8 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Here the great valour of the Dravidas of this period is referred to <br />by Viyasa. </p>
<p>[17] "........Being of such low origin, how can they be conversant <br />with the duties ordained in the scriptures? The Karashakas, the <br />Mahishakas, the Kalingas, the Keralas, the Karktakas, the Virakas, <br />and other peoples of no religion one should always avoid....' </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - KARNA PARVA, PAGE 109 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />This statement cannot be accepted as during this period the Keralas <br />who were the Cheras had Vedic rituals practiced in their country. </p>
<p>[18] ".......The Dravida, the Andhaka and the Niishada foot-soldiers, <br />urged on by Satyaki, once more rushed towards Karna in that battle <br />from desire of slaying him......." </p>
<p>MAHABHARAHA - KARNA PARVA, PAGE 122 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />The above too confirms Dravidas fought against Karna of the Kaurava <br />side. </p>
<p>[19] "........The mighty Pandya that foremost of all wielders of <br />weapons has been slain in battle by the Pandavas, what can it be but <br />destiny ?......" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - SALYA PARVA, PAGE 5 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Here we note the Pandya as one the greatest among warriors killed in <br />the war. </p>
<p>[20] ".......like one perfectly withdrawn from the world is a real <br />Yogin of the Bhikshu order....." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 81 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />place after the birth of Buddha. </p>
<p>[21] ".........Vasudeva's son Krishna ......It was he that slew king <br />Pandya by striking his breast against his, and moved down the <br />Kalingas in battle. Burnt by him the city of Varanasi remained for <br />many years without a king......" </p>
<p>Observation: <br />The above confirms that the Pandya king who participated in the <br />Baratha war was killed by Krishna the son of Vasudeva. </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 115 </p>
<p>[22] "Vasudeva said........Thou O Karna hast been born in this way. <br />Thou art therefore morally the son of Pandu......O thou of mighty <br />arms with thy brothers the Pandavas with yapas and homas and <br />auspicious rites of diverse kinds performed in thy honour. Let the <br />Dravidas with the Kuntalas, the Andhras an the Talacharas, Shuchupas, <br />and the Venupas all walk before thee......." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 270-271 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Dravidas are mentined here again. </p>
<p>[23] "...........and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great strength <br />brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And <br />similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast -land near the sea, came <br />accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of <br />kings....." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />the sea in the south of India too came with large forces to asist the <br />Pandava king Yuthistra. </p>
<p>[24] ".........O son of Kunti art indulging in similar bragging, be a <br />man1........O Partha thou wishest in vain to conquer !........why art <br />thou not able to realise the might of this vast army of the assembled <br />monarchs......the Dravidas, the Andhras and the Kanchis, this host of <br />many nations ready for battle......." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 311 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />The might of the forces of Dravidas and Kanchis are mentioned here. <br />Kanchis probably refers to Thondaiman kings. </p>
<p>[25] "........The mighty Sarangadhwaja, endued with wealth of energy, <br />the king of the Pandyas, on seeds of the hue of the moon's rays and <br />decked with armour set with stones of lapis lazuli advanced upon <br />Drona stretching his excellent bow......" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE ....? </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Here the Pandiyan King is mentioned by the name Saranga-dhwaja who <br />was of great valour, and gives a description of his armour fitted <br />with pearls (lapis lazuli). </p>
<p>[26] "Sanjaya said listen to me O king (Thiratharastra).......to the <br />names of the provinces as I mention them. They are.......the <br />Keralas......the Andhras.......There are other kingdoms O bull of <br />Bharatha's race, in the south. They are the Dravidas, the Keralas <br />(repeated again)......the Karanatakas......the Cholas......" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BHISHMA PARVA, PAGE 21&amp;22 </p>
<p>Observartion: <br />Here the southern kingdoms of India namely the Kerala (the Cheras), <br />Andhara, Dravidas, Karnatakas and the Cholas are mentioned. These are <br />presenly called by a general term as the Dravidian States. Hence it <br />is clear that the Sanjaya who was daily advicing the king <br />Thiratharastra - father of Duriyodana and the sage Viyasa who wrote <br />the Mahabaratha epic after the event, knew the Dravidian states of <br />South India. </p>
<p>[27] ".......It is in consequence of he absencee of Brahmaanas from <br />among them that the Sakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas and other <br />Kshatriya tribes have fallen and degraded into thee status of Sudras. <br />The Dravidas, the Kalingas, the Pulandas, he Usinaras, the <br />Kolisarpas, the Mahishakas and other Kshatriyas havee in consequence <br />of the absence of Brahmanas from among their midst become degraded <br />nto Sudras...." </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - ANUSASANA PARVA, PAGE 157 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Dravidas have been mentioned here again. </p>
<p>[28] ".........the great river Lohita, Tamra, Aruna, Vetravathi, <br />Parnasa, Gautami, the Godavari, Vena, Krishnavena, Dwija, <br />Drishadvati, Kaveri, Vankhu, Mandakini Prayaga, Prabhasa........" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - ANUSASANA PARVA, PAGE 390 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />River Kaveri is mentioned again. </p>
<p>[29] ".........Then, O bull in Bharata's race, Nandini alarmed at the <br />sight of Viswamitra's troops.......from her tail she brought forth an <br />army of Palhavas, and from her udders an army of Dravidas and Sakas <br />and from her womb an army of Yavanas and from her urine an army of <br />Kanchis and from her sides an army of Savaras. And from the froth of <br />her mouth came out hosts of Paundras and Kiratas, Yavanas, and <br />Sinhalas and the barbarous tribes of Khasas and Chivukas and Pulindas <br />and Chinas and Hunas and Keralas........" </p>
<p>MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, ADI PARVA, PAGE 356 </p>
<p>Observation: <br />Keralas (Cheras), Kanchis(Thondaimans), and Dravidas are mentioned <br />here again. </p>

        <p>Thanks Prof</p>
<p>I am not saying that these names were not there they are restorations <br />of old names maybe but the point I am raising is they were not one <br />single state during the epic times eg there wasnt a tamilnadu or <br />tamils there were chera chozha pallava pandya kingdoms.....agree? <br />like wise Ganga, Chalukya, rashtrakooda and Kalinga ..kingdoms not <br />karnatakas and andras....</p>
<blockquote><p>  2.Tradition has it that Pandyas traced themselves back to Pandu who <br />in turn was of the lunar race.So the Pandya king should have been on </p></blockquote>
<p>the side of the Pandavas in the MBh war.</p>
<p>Thats exactly my point so why would the pandavas fight and kill a <br />pandya king as it is said in the verses??</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>  1.There is mentions of andras karnatakas and keralas...All these <br />were <br />  linguistic states which emerged in later days...The kerala was <br />Chera <br />  kingdom The Karnataka of Today was part Ganga and part Hoisalya nd <br />  part Chalukya and like wise andra was chalukya kigdoms that is not <br />  beleivable   <br />  @@@@@his subjection and exacted tributes from Paundrayas and the <br />    Dravidas <br />      along with the Udrakeralas and the Andhras and the Talavanas <br />the <br />      Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas and also the delightful city of <br />    Atavi <br />      and that of Yavanas......." <br />  @@@@</p>
<p>  2.Krishna did not fight in the great war he was just the <br />  charioteer...this following statement counters that@@@@ <br />  [21] ".........Vasudeva's son Krishna ......It was he that slew <br />    king <br />      Pandya by striking his breast against his, and moved down the <br />      Kalingas in battle. Burnt by him the city of Varanasi remained <br />  for <br />      many years without a king......" </p>
<p>  Here it states that Cholas,pandyas and Cheras fought with the <br />  pandavas if so why would Krishna kill the pandya king?</p>
<p>      [2] "........When that host was being thus struck and slain by <br />    heroic <br />      warriors, the Parthas headed by Vrikodara advance against us. <br />  They <br />      consisted of Dhrishtayumna and Sikhandin, and the five sons of <br />      Draupadi, and the Prabhadrakes, and Satyaki, and Chekitana with <br />    the <br />      Dravida forces, and the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas, <br />      surrounded by a mighty array, all possessed of broad chests, <br />long <br />      arms, tall statures an large eyes. Decked with ornaments, <br />    possessed <br />      of red teeth, endued with the prowess of infuriate elephants, <br />    attired [19]     </p>
<p>  Yet It states the Pandya king was slain by the pandavas....and <br />  another verse says he fought with the pandavas confusinf and <br />  contradictory???/@@@@<br />  "........The mighty Pandya that foremost of all wielders of <br />      weapons has been slain in battle by the Pandavas, what can it <br />be <br />    but <br />      destiny ?......"</p>
<p>  [23] "...........and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great <br />    strength <br />      brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And <br />      similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast -land near the sea, <br />came <br />      accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king <br />  of <br />      kings....." </p>

        <p>Dear Sridhar Rathinam,<br />May I venture a few clarifications on the points raised by you?<br />1.The names Andhra,Karnataka and Kerala are not post linguistic reorganisation ones but original names which had been restored after centuries of distortion.For example Karnataka is derived possibly from Karunadu and Carnatic music is derived from this name.Kerala comes from narikela which means coconut and the name points to a country abounding in coconuts.Cera might have been a Tamil form of the sanskrit name.In fact sangam poems talk of Ceralar (See Orikkonru Ceralarkkitta...,Netunceralatan,Utiyanceral etc). These are names which occurred in the ancient list of 56 or 64? counteries starting from Anga,Vanga,Kalinga,Kashmira etc.<br />2.Tradition has it that Pandyas traced themselves back to Pandu who in turn was of the lunar race.So the Pandya king should have been on the side of the Pandavas in the MBh war.<br />GR</p>

        <p>Dear Mr.Sridhar,<br />Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Sriraman and have very recently joined the PONNIYINSELVAN group.<br />I have long been interested in subjects, such as deciphering of inscriptions etc., but as I have mentioned in an earlier mail, have not been able to get proper resources for learning these subjects. History is something that we have to learn properly or not at all. I am sure that most group members would agree upon this point.<br />I, for one have a lot of interest in the subject, and have joined specifically to learn from the discussions. As such I may not have any immediate significant contributions to make...except may be to clarify certain doubts. So I would beg you to excuse my naivety and not be disappointed if I just read and delete. Anyway I am trying to catch up by reading certain books etc. </p>
<p>Incidentally, may I ask your source of the mail below...which talks about the Pandyas,Cholas etc. participating in the Mahabarata?<br />Another small <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of information that I happen to have for the members...are you all aware that the current edition of Mahabharata is actually the 3rd Release?</p>
<p>Regards and Cheers,<br />Sriraman</p>

<blockquote><p>  References to Tamil Royal Dynasties and Tamil Countries, in the <br />  original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa </p>
<p>  Dear Readers, <br />  The original Sanskrit Mahabharatha written by Sage - Viyasa, has <br />many <br />  references on the Tamil Royal Dynasties, and on the Tamil <br />Countries <br />  of South India and their geographical locations within, that were <br />  known during the period of the Mahabharatha, which I trust will be <br />of <br />  much interest to the research - scholars and students of Tamil <br />  History and append below same to their benefit. </p>
<p>  I have selected the version of Mahabharatha translated into <br />English <br />  Prose by "Mr Kisari Mohan Ganguli" from the original Sanskrit Text <br />of <br />  Sage Viysa, and published by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers (Pvt) <br />  Ltd, New Delhi, India, from which the following have been <br />extracted. </p>
<p>  ------------------------------------------------------ </p>
<p>  [1] ".......Dhritarashtra (i.ee.Thiritarasra) said, `Hear O <br />Sanjaya <br />  the celestial feeats of Vasudeva feats that Govinda achieved and <br />the <br />  like of which no otheer person hath ever been able to <br />  achieve......The mighty Krishna also slew the valiant king of <br />  Chedis.......all these he vanquished in battle. The <br />Avantis......the <br />  Cholas, the Pandyas......as also Sakas, and the Yavanas with <br />  followers were all vanquished by him ........' </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - DRONA PARVA, PAGE 23. </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Pandyas in a battle prior to Baratha war. </p>
<p>  [2] "........When that host was being thus struck and slain by <br />heroic <br />  warriors, the Parthas headed by Vrikodara advance against us. They <br />  consisted of Dhrishtayumna and Sikhandin, and the five sons of <br />  Draupadi, and the Prabhadrakes, and Satyaki, and Chekitana with <br />the <br />  Dravida forces, and the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas, <br />  surrounded by a mighty array, all possessed of broad chests, long <br />  arms, tall statures an large eyes. Decked with ornaments, <br />possessed <br />  of red teeth, endued with the prowess of infuriate elephants, <br />attired <br />  in robes of diverse colours, smeared with powere scents, armed <br />with <br />  swords and nooses, capable of restraining mightty elephants, <br />  companions in death, and never eserting one other, equipped with <br />  quivers, bearing bows adorne with long locks, an agreeable in <br />speech <br />  were the combatants of the infantry files led by Sayaki, belonging <br />to <br />  Andhra tribe, retinue with fierce forms and great energy. Other <br />brave <br />  warriors such as the Chedis, the Panchalas, the Kaikayas, the <br />  Karushas, the Kosalas, the Kanchis, and the Maghadhas also rushed <br />  forward........" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - KARNA PARVA, PAGE 25. KULUTAS PAGE 26 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />the <br />  Cheras, the Kanchi undoubtedly the Thondaimandala kings whose <br />capital <br />  was at Kanchi. all fought on the side of the Pandavas. </p>
<p>  [3] ".......I behold the Ganga, the Satudru, the Sita, the Yamuna, <br />  and the Kausiki, the Charmanwati, the Vetravati, the Chandrabaga, <br />the <br />  Saraswati, the Sindhu, the Vipasa, and the Godavari, the <br />Vaswokasara, <br />  the Nalini and the Narmada, the Tamara, and the Venna also of <br />  delightful current and sacred waters, the Suvenna, the Krishna-<br />venna, <br />  the Irama,and the Mahanadi, the Vitasti, O great king and that <br />large <br />  river Cavery, the one also O tiger ! among men the Visalya and the <br />  Kimpuna also......" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 381. </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />river <br />  Cavery river would have been very wide with more flow of water as <br />the <br />  pronoun "large river" is only used to river Cavery, when many of <br />the <br />  other rivers of India was being referred simply as rivers in <br />  Mahabaratha. The above also describes of the warrirors from the <br />Tamil <br />  countries and of their forces ,valour and armoury. </p>
<p>  [4] "Markandeya said `O bull of the Bharata race even Rama <br />suffered <br />  unparalled misery, for the evil minded Ravana king of Rakshasas, <br />  having recourse to deceit and overpowering the vulture Jatayu <br />  forcibly carried away his wife Sita from his asylum in the woods. <br />  Indeed Rama with the help of Sugriva brought her back, <br />constructing a <br />  bridge across the sea, and consuming Lanka with his keen-edged <br />  arrows........" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 533 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  undergone by kings prior to Pandavas refers to the Rama and Ravana <br />  story being the Ramayana. Hence it is very clear Mahabaratha war <br />took <br />  place after tthe Ramayana story. </p>
<p>  [5] ".......then going to the south Karna vanquished the mighty <br />  charioteers and in Dakshinatya the Suta's son entered into <br />conflict <br />  with Rukmi.......Having met with Rukmi, Karna repaired to Pandya <br />and <br />  the mountain Sri.

<p>  MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 21 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Here too it is evident that during the days of Mahabaratha the <br />river <br />  Kaveri which flowed through the Chola country was held in high <br />esteem <br />  by the North Indians among all other rivers of India. </p>
<p>  [9] ".......the son of Pandu (Sahadeva)........the hero brought <br />under <br />  his subjection and exacted tributes from Paundrayas and the <br />Dravidas <br />  along with the Udrakeralas and the Andhras and the Talavanas the <br />  Kalingas and the Ushtrakarnikas and also the delightful city of <br />Atavi <br />  and that of Yavanas......." </p>

<p>  MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABHAPARVA, PAGE 70/71 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  We note from the above to attend the Yuthistra's sacrifice (Yaga) <br />  among many who came were the Dravidas and the Singhalas of Sri <br />Lanka <br />  too have came. </p>
<p>  [11] ".....and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avant Pandya......" </p>

And numberless dark-coloured <br />men <br />  with the ends of their eyes red as copper attired in cloths decked <br />  with gems waited at the gate with those presents......" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, SABAPARVA, PAGE 105 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Cholas the Pandyas and the Sinhalas from Sri Lanka brought to king <br />  Yuthistra as present on the occasion of the great Yaga conducted <br />by <br />  him. </p>
<p>  [13] ".......and even Krishna himself.......addressing <br />Yudhishthira <br />  said That prosperity which the sons of Pritha had acquired at <br />  Indraprastha and which unobtainable by other kings was beheld by <br />me <br />  at the Rajasuya sacrifice at which besides I saw all kings even <br />those <br />  of the Vangas and Angas and Paundras and Odras and Cholas and <br />  Dravidas and Andhakas and the chiefs of many islands and countries <br />on <br />  the sea-board as also of frontier states including the rulers of <br />the <br />  Sinhalas, the barbarous Mlecchas, the natives of Lanka, and all <br />the <br />  kings of the west by hundreds, and all the chiefs of the sea-<br />coast, <br />  and the kings of the Pahlavas and the Daradas and the various <br />tribes <br />  of the Kiratas and Yavanas and Sakras and the Harahunas and <br />  Chinas ........" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATHA - BY K.M.GANGULI VANAPARVA, PAGE 110 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Krishna himself personally saw the Cholas, Dravidas, and the <br />Sinhalas <br />  being present at the Yaga sacrifice which he confirmed to <br />Yuthistra. </p>
<p>  [14] "........Proceeding next to the mountain Rishabha in Pandya <br />  worshipped by the gods, one obtains the merit of the Vajpeya <br />  sacrifice and rejoices in heaven. One should next proceed to the <br />  river Kaveri, frequented by Apsaras. Bathing there O monarch ! and <br />  obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Touching next <br />the <br />  waters of the tirtha called Kanya on the shores of the sea one is <br />  cleansed from every sin. Proceeding next to Gokarna celebrated <br />over <br />  the three worlds and which is situate O best of kings ! in the <br />midst <br />  of the deep (sea ??? - Trincomalee of Sri Lanka???)and referenced <br />by <br />  all the worlds........worship the lord of Uma, one should worship <br />  Isana, fasting there for three nights. By this he acquireth the <br />merit <br />  of the horse-sacrifce and the status of Gnapatya by staying there <br />for <br />  twelve nights one's soul is clensed of all sins........" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 192 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Here we note the description of the mountain in the Pandya <br />country, <br />  about the river Kaveri, the thirtha the Kanyakumari, and Gokarna <br />it <br />  seems to refer to the modern Thirukkoneswaram in north-east Sri <br />  Lanka, a Shiva shrine. </p>
<p>  [15] "......Dhaumya continued, Listen O Bharata I shall now <br />narrate <br />  to thee in detail according to my knowledge the sacred tirthas of <br />the <br />  south......O Yudhishthira in the country of the Pandyas are the <br />  tirthas named Agastya and Varuna ! and O bull among men there <br />amongst <br />  the Pandavas is the thirtha called Kumaris. Listen O son of Kunti <br />I <br />  shall now describe Tamraparni. In that asylum the gods had <br />undergone <br />  penances impelled by the desire of obtaining salvation. In that <br />  region also is the lake of Gokarna which is celebrated over the <br />three <br />  worlds hath an abundance of cool waters and is sacred auspicious <br />and <br />  capable O child of producing great merit. That lake is extremely <br />  difficult of access to men of unpurified souls. Near to that <br />thirtha <br />  is the sacred asylum of Agastya's disciple the mountain Devasabha <br />  which abounds in trees and grass and friuts and roots. And there <br />also <br />  is the Vaiduryya mountain which is delightful abounding in gems <br />  capable of bestowing great merit. There on that mountain is the <br />  asylum of Agastya abounding in friuts roots and water.......' </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, VANAPARVA, PAGE 200/201 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Here a description is given on the sacred Thirthas of the Pandya <br />  country the Agastya the Varuna the Gokarna of the mountains <br />Devasabha <br />  and Vaidurya that were known during the Mahabaratha days. </p>
<p>  [16] "........Radha's son of the Suta caste, an those mighty car-<br />  warriors who were his brothers,an the Kaikeyas, the Mallavas, the <br />  Madrakas the Dravidas of fierce prowress, the Yaudheyas, the <br />  Lalittyas, the Kshudrakas, the Usinaras, the Tundikeras, the <br />  Savitriputras, the Easterners, the Northerners, the Westerners and <br />  the southerners, O sire, have all been slain by <br />Savyasachin......." </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - KARNA PARVA, PAGE 8 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Here the great valour of the Dravidas of this period is referred <br />to <br />  by Viyasa. </p>
<p>  [17] "........Being of such low origin, how can they be conversant <br />  with the duties ordained in the scriptures? The Karashakas, the <br />  Mahishakas, the Kalingas, the Keralas, the Karktakas, the Virakas, <br />  and other peoples of no religion one should always avoid....' </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - KARNA PARVA, PAGE 109 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  This statement cannot be accepted as during this period the <br />Keralas <br />  who were the Cheras had Vedic rituals practiced in their country. </p>
<p>  [18] ".......The Dravida, the Andhaka and the Niishada foot-<br />soldiers, <br />  urged on by Satyaki, once more rushed towards Karna in that battle <br />  from desire of slaying him......." </p>
<p>  MAHABHARAHA - KARNA PARVA, PAGE 122 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  The above too confirms Dravidas fought against Karna of the <br />Kaurava <br />  side. </p>
<p>  [19] "........The mighty Pandya that foremost of all wielders of <br />  weapons has been slain in battle by the Pandavas, what can it be <br />but <br />  destiny ?......" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - SALYA PARVA, PAGE 5 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Here we note the Pandya as one the greatest among warriors killed <br />in <br />  the war. </p>
<p>  [20] ".......like one perfectly withdrawn from the world is a real <br />  Yogin of the Bhikshu order....." </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 81 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />took <br />  place after the birth of Buddha. </p>
<p>  [21] ".........Vasudeva's son Krishna ......It was he that slew <br />king <br />  Pandya by striking his breast against his, and moved down the <br />  Kalingas in battle. Burnt by him the city of Varanasi remained for <br />  many years without a king......" </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  The above confirms that the Pandya king who participated in the <br />  Baratha war was killed by Krishna the son of Vasudeva. </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 115 </p>
<p>  [22] "Vasudeva said........Thou O Karna hast been born in this <br />way. <br />  Thou art therefore morally the son of Pandu......O thou of mighty <br />  arms with thy brothers the Pandavas with yapas and homas and <br />  auspicious rites of diverse kinds performed in thy honour. Let the <br />  Dravidas with the Kuntalas, the Andhras an the Talacharas, <br />Shuchupas, <br />  and the Venupas all walk before thee......." </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 270-271 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Dravidas are mentined here again. </p>
<p>  [23] "...........and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great <br />strength <br />  brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And <br />  similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast -land near the sea, came <br />  accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of <br />  kings....." </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />to <br />  the sea in the south of India too came with large forces to asist <br />the <br />  Pandava king Yuthistra. </p>
<p>  [24] ".........O son of Kunti art indulging in similar bragging, <br />be a <br />  man1........O Partha thou wishest in vain to conquer !........why <br />art <br />  thou not able to realise the might of this vast army of the <br />assembled <br />  monarchs......the Dravidas, the Andhras and the Kanchis, this host <br />of <br />  many nations ready for battle......." </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 311 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  The might of the forces of Dravidas and Kanchis are mentioned <br />here. <br />  Kanchis probably refers to Thondaiman kings. </p>
<p>  [25] "........The mighty Sarangadhwaja, endued with wealth of <br />energy, <br />  the king of the Pandyas, on seeds of the hue of the moon's rays <br />and <br />  decked with armour set with stones of lapis lazuli advanced upon <br />  Drona stretching his excellent bow......" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE ....? </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Here the Pandiyan King is mentioned by the name Saranga-dhwaja who <br />  was of great valour, and gives a description of his armour fitted <br />  with pearls (lapis lazuli). </p>
<p>  [26] "Sanjaya said listen to me O king (Thiratharastra).......to <br />the <br />  names of the provinces as I mention them. They are.......the <br />  Keralas......the Andhras.......There are other kingdoms O bull of <br />  Bharatha's race, in the south. They are the Dravidas, the Keralas <br />  (repeated again)......the Karanatakas......the Cholas......" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - BHISHMA PARVA, PAGE 21&amp;22 </p>
<p>  Observartion: <br />  Here the southern kingdoms of India namely the Kerala (the <br />Cheras), <br />  Andhara, Dravidas, Karnatakas and the Cholas are mentioned. These <br />are <br />  presenly called by a general term as the Dravidian States. Hence <br />it <br />  is clear that the Sanjaya who was daily advicing the king <br />  Thiratharastra - father of Duriyodana and the sage Viyasa who <br />wrote <br />  the Mahabaratha epic after the event, knew the Dravidian states of <br />  South India. </p>
<p>  [27] ".......It is in consequence of he absencee of Brahmaanas <br />from <br />  among them that the Sakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas and other <br />  Kshatriya tribes have fallen and degraded into thee status of <br />Sudras. <br />  The Dravidas, the Kalingas, the Pulandas, he Usinaras, the <br />  Kolisarpas, the Mahishakas and other Kshatriyas havee in <br />consequence <br />  of the absence of Brahmanas from among their midst become degraded <br />  nto Sudras...." </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - ANUSASANA PARVA, PAGE 157 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Dravidas have been mentioned here again. </p>

<p>  MAHABHARATA - ANUSASANA PARVA, PAGE 390 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  River Kaveri is mentioned again. </p>
<p>  [29] ".........Then, O bull in Bharata's race, Nandini alarmed at <br />the <br />  sight of Viswamitra's troops.......from her tail she brought forth <br />an <br />  army of Palhavas, and from her udders an army of Dravidas and <br />Sakas <br />  and from her womb an army of Yavanas and from her urine an army of <br />  Kanchis and from her sides an army of Savaras. And from the froth <br />of <br />  her mouth came out hosts of Paundras and Kiratas, Yavanas, and <br />  Sinhalas and the barbarous tribes of Khasas and Chivukas and <br />Pulindas <br />  and Chinas and Hunas and Keralas........" </p>
<p>  MAHABHARATA - BY K.M.GANGULI, ADI PARVA, PAGE 356 </p>
<p>  Observation: <br />  Keralas (Cheras), Kanchis(Thondaimans), and Dravidas are mentioned <br />  here again. </p>

          REFERENCES TO TAMIL ROYAL DYNASTIES &amp; TAMIL COUNTRIES IN MAHABHA        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Srihari,</p>
<p>This is very interesting .. you have drawn the attention to certain <br />facts :</p>
<p>Significance of Cauvery &amp; Kabila river : </p>
<p>Kabila river runs from Thondai nadu through Cuddalore - near Panruti -<br />on the banks of Thiruvadhigai - Sastha is supposed to have born! <br />Marxia Gandhi has written extensively on this part of Tamil nadu. <br />She says, it was the Capital of Protugese... </p>
<p>That belt - Thivuakkarai - Thirubuvanai - Thiruvadhigai is marked <br />with pre-historic finds.. Dyno eggs - fossils etc. Near Ariyalur we <br />have a fossil forest!</p>
<p>Good to know that Cholas, Cheras, Kanchis &amp; Pandyas are found in <br />Mahabarath! Thiruvarur Musunda chravarthy is found in Devasura War! <br />In reciprocation of his services, the diety worshipped by Indira came <br />to Thiruvarur - hence the Wings!</p>
<p>Fondly, SB</p>
