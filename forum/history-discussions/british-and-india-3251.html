<p>hi</p>
<p>my my rahul. you have spent a lot of time thinking about this.<br />but lets get the facts right.<br />the british created a loosely held federation of british india and <br />650 princely states( which could not economically survive without <br />B.India)<br />and then the catlayst was sardar patel who bullied the states into <br />submission.<br />OTHERWISE we could not have been one state-india.<br />imagine getting a passport to go to pudukottai or bangalore or <br />hyderabad.<br />economically british india would have survived and the princely <br />states would have collapsed.<br />read about the history of sikkim to assess what could have happened <br />650 times over.<br />you are talking about foreigners looking down on us. perhaps we look <br />upto them too. the chogyal of sikkim married a foreigner. one of the <br />senior princes of pudukottai married a australian nurse. so many of <br />them inspite of claiming lineage from sun, moon, indra and kubera <br />wanted to marry caucasid ladies.</p>
<p>I sugest you read about the lives of the princes of india. how <br />lusty, blood thirsty and mean they have been at the cost of their <br />people.<br />the princes considerd congress as an enemy more than the british <br />themselves. gandhi was banned more than once from enetering <br />pudukottai state.<br />i also suggest you read freedom at midnight.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Mr Venkatesh/Mr Arun;   <br />  Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i beg to <br />differ. I<br />  think India still would have been a vibrant economy even without <br />the<br />  British. Maybe it would have taken a bit more time but it would <br />certainly<br />  have happened. There is always this attitude that without the <br />British we<br />  wouldn't have had the railways,command over the English<br />  language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these things <br />without the<br />  British and we would have remained united. The British made sure <br />when they<br />  were leaving that this problem of religion and partition would <br />haunt us for<br />  ever.</p>
<p>  I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did not <br />rule India"<br />  as this is purely hypothetical. Do you think a culture which is <br />as old as<br />  ours changed for the better just because of a minuscule period <br />ruled by the<br />  British? Just because you are a superior nation it does not give <br />you the<br />  right to rule over the weak let alone take their lives. My clients <br />in<br />  England still treat this country as an English colony.</p>
<p>  What happened to us by the British is similar to what is happening <br />to Iraq<br />  by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has railways,proper <br />government<br />  systems would they be happy that the US came and conquered them? <br />No! This<br />  attitude is prevalent amongst us Indians,only! I remember reading <br />in a<br />  thread before "Indians are the ONLY countrymen who are not proud <br />about their<br />  past"</p>
<p>  Remember what Nelson Mandela said "The problem is not that they <br />think they<br />  are superior the problem we think we are inferior"</p>

<p>    this is a hatred psychosis imposed on us by our politicians.<br />    hatred towards the brits were the unifying force for the freedom<br />    movement.</p>
<p>    we are still paying for the " indian rule" from 1800 till <br />1947.and<br />    lets realise its a costly payment.<br />    but for the british we would be like africa. 600 poor states<br />    fighting each other.<br />    thats why films like mangal pandey seem so out of place today.</p>

<p>      I have always felt this "anger" or even "hatred" towards the <br />Brits<br />    that many<br />      Indians have as just a wee bit irrational.

<p>                heres some matter on yusuf khan from the net</p>
<p>                Tradition has many stories to tell of this remarkable<br />    man,<br />        who is<br />                commonly known in Madura as Khansa, an abbrevlation <br />for<br />    Khan<br />            Sahib.<br />                He was born in the Rammnad country and was <br />originally a<br />        Hindu of<br />            the<br />                Vellala Caste. He ran away from his home, took <br />Service<br />    under<br />        a<br />                European for three years in pondicherry, was <br />dismissed,<br />        served<br />            under<br />                another European (who educated him), went to the <br />Nawab's<br />        court,<br />            rose<br />                rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and<br />    eventually,<br />        as<br />            has<br />                been seen, became Commandant of all the Company's<br />    sepoys. His<br />                executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the <br />report<br />        (see<br />                below) from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and<br />        entitled 'A<br />                view of the English interests in India'--which was<br />        republished in<br />                Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and<br />    Madura 'his<br />        whole<br />                administration denoted vigour and effect. His <br />justice was<br />                unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were<br />    happily<br />                combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no <br />refuge<br />    from<br />                punishment.' It concludes by saying that his example<br />    shows<br />                that 'wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate <br />or<br />            complexion.'</p>
<p>                Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />                The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to <br />the<br />        country,<br />                renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />        moderate<br />            sum<br />                of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of<br />    1759 and<br />            began<br />                by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting<br />    avenues<br />            through<br />                their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they<br />    fled, or<br />                executed as malefactors any who were taken <br />prisoners. He<br />        went on<br />            to<br />                reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had<br />        sobered all<br />                the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He <br />even<br />        had the<br />                audacity to make war on the king of Travancore <br />without<br />    the<br />            knowledge<br />                or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in <br />1762, he<br />            offered to<br />                lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at <br />seven<br />        lakhs<br />            per<br />                annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was<br />    enraged at<br />            this,<br />                or whether he thought himself powerful enough to <br />defy his<br />            masters--<br />                he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and <br />began<br />    to<br />            collect<br />                troops.</p>
<p>                He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />                In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against <br />him<br />    and<br />        he<br />            was<br />                besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly <br />all<br />        deserted<br />                him, but he held out until October 1764 with great<br />    energy and<br />            skill,<br />                renovating and strengthening the fort at great <br />expense--<br />    he is<br />            said<br />                to have 'entirely repaired' its east face and <br />constantly<br />        employed<br />                3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief <br />assault<br />        with a<br />                loss of 120 Europeans (including nine officers) <br />killed<br />    and<br />            wounded.<br />                At the end of that time little real progress against <br />him<br />    had<br />        been<br />                made, except that the place was now rigorously <br />blockaded,<br />        but he<br />            was<br />                treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in<br />    charge<br />        of<br />            the<br />                French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />        Campbell, who<br />                commanded the English among the besiegers. He was<br />        ignominiously<br />                hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of<br />    Madura,<br />        and<br />            his<br />                body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque <br />was<br />        afterwards<br />                erected over the tomb. It is still in existence--to <br />the<br />    left<br />        of<br />            the<br />                read to Dindigul, a little beyond the toll-gate--and <br />is<br />    known<br />                as 'Khan Sahib's pallivasal.'</p>
