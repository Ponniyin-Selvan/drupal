<p>The Membership directory is not widely / popularly available.</p>
<p>Also the activities of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  does not IMPACT the population at large <br />not even the members though the membersip no. is considerable. We <br />need <br />to have a formal discussion corner to express members views rather <br />than one - one dialogue.</acronym></p>
<p>For this to begin with I suggest that the coomunication to reach all <br />the members (directory to be made available visibly)regularly. One <br />to <br />one communication should not be personalised in nature (example <br />information on Cricketer Vishu vs. Gavaskar irrelevant to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  is <br />not to be encouraged; Similarly in the poll , ' who beter suit to <br />play V'thevan'). For this rules (may be flexible but should <br />contribute to the very purpose of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym ) to be framed. OBJECTIVES <br />should be made explicitly. DO's And DONT's to be stipulated.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Hope my suggestions are worth considering. I will be too willing to <br />associate myself (except for the time factor) to interact, develop a <br />modus-operandi to make <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  to serve its PURPOSE. yOu may contact me <br />in this regard.</acronym></p>
<p>(Though I joined recently, seeing the group sites being used both in <br />India &amp; abroad, these are very few points that come across at the <br />first moment)</p>

        <p>hi i would like to share my points in connection with<br />mr.venkateshkrishnan's view</p>
<p>if you are going to treat archakas as professionals then<br />my suggestion is appointment of archakas should also be based on<br />qualifications and like a degree of diploma in this this vedas and agamas<br />and etc., then conduct an state wide or national level examinations like<br />SSC or <acronym title="Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission" TNPSC</acronym  etc., as usually with the previling nature 69% will be on quota<br />based so the ultimate goal of putting archakas in all caste will be reached.<br />i know the consequences of being a selected government employee :-) .</acronym></p>
<p>Advantages of the proposed system</p>
<p>a) all caste esp. majority of bc / obc and others will become archakas<br />b) all religions can also become archakas<br />amazing isnt it a revolution in hinduism<br />a muslim perfoms pooja for meenakshi and a christian will perform pooja for<br />sundareswarar.</p>
<p>a small problem is did u heard abt vadipatti velanganni temple<br />some followers used to call the madurai city as a city ruled by a women<br />demon. (leave them alone after all we are the only race in this world who<br />can tolerate everything under the sun above the sun above the galaxy also.)</p>
<p>and i will personally make history the architect of hindu revolution. (if<br />nobody tries to steel it from me)</p>

        <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Whether madan's count crosses hundred or not, this thread has <br />crossed hundred postings. Also I see the thread is moving wildly <br />from one topic to another. As I understood, mostly discussed topic <br />in this thread is the caste system in Hinduism vis-?-vis other <br />religions. Also, this thread touched some times upon the archaka <br />issue.</p>
<p>Here is my 2 dollars worth ! (I think we should value ourselves a <br /><acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  high).</p>
<p>I think caste system is unique to India. Though discrimination is <br />prevalent all over the world on apartheid and race basis, to my <br />knowledge caste does not exist anywhere else.</p>
<p>If we see the evolution of caste, caste system started with the <br />nature of work and there was no discrimination in the early days. I <br />think this is what Nehru Ji also said in discovery of India. <br />Goldsmith's son became goldsmith. Merchant's son became Merchant. So <br />on and so forth. I also believe and could see from the known history <br />that until the end of 19th century, people strictly adhered to the <br />nature of work that belonged to their fathers (or caste).</p>
<p>With the advent of British Rule, westernisation of education etc. <br />people moved away from their heridetory work to other prospective <br />avenues. Though people from a particular community first took the <br />advantage, others followed the suit sooner or later.</p>
<p>Thus, today's caste scenario is different version altogether. Today <br />we claim caste by birth. By profession we are different. But for a <br />handful of few, every one else has changed their profession <br />different from their heridetory one.</p>
<p>Today there is no bar from any quarter to pursue any profession <br />(including archaka). For archaka matter, there were doubts and <br />objections arising from several sections. My only question is when <br />everybody can pursue any profession without any glitch, why <br />profession of archaka is to be excluded.</p>
<p>If a person, truly qualified for archaka with requisite devotion, I <br />think there should not be any bar for him/her to pursue that <br />profession. People may say archaka is not a profession. I would beg <br />to differ. As I said earlier archaka was also a profession entrusted <br />to particular people like any other caste.</p>
<p>Somebody also raised the issue that grants were given to them by <br />kings etc. Now those kings themselves perished. Another point is <br />that there were several other professions attached to the temple <br />including devadasi. What happened to all of them? Today we see <br />temples having electric drum and bells during pooja. When things <br />have changed to that extent why this only needs to be secluded?</p>
<p>By strongly denying archakaship &amp; knowledge of Veda to others, <br />people only cause irrepairable damage to the rich Sanatana <br />tradition. While there is a considerable reduction from a particular <br />community to pursue the Vedas, denying access to others will only <br />hasten its extinction. My humble opinion is access to Vedas and God <br />to be made more liberal, which is also good for everyone.</p>
<p>Change is the only thing that remains unchanged. If you do not <br />change you dither. This is the fundamental of evolution theory.</p>

        <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Wanted to give my opinion on points raised by Sridhar<br />Rathinam.</p>
<p>He has given the following points in his Aryan<br />Dravidian mail.</p>
<p>1. The Vedic Civilisation was Indian <br />2. Nomadic migrants from Mid Asia You can call them <br />Aryans<br />3. And the different physical aspects of north <br />indians versus south indians</p>
<p>The problem starts when people start using this<br />"Nomadic migrants" from Mid Asia as originaters of<br />Vedic civilization. Till today there has not been a<br />single proof that nomadic migrants came to India<br />before Vedic period or during vedic period.</p>
<p>In physical appearnce of people, there is bound to be<br />difference because of climate, food and live style.<br />When you take a Kashmiri, Maharashtrian and Tamilian,<br />the Maharashtrian will be in in between the other two<br />in colour complexion, body features etc. </p>
<p>Even in US, people of New England look different from<br />people of Virgina. Not now, but every during the days<br />of Thomas Jefferson and Quincy Adams (around 1780s).<br />Books of Thomas Jefferson and Adam disucss this. This<br />difference is there even though for both New England<br />and Virgina, British people were their ancestors who<br />came to America around 1600s</p>
<p>Second point is about "vedic rules" :</p>
<p>There is an general misconception that Vedas were<br />composed by Brahmins alone. Actually Vedas were<br />composed by people from many communities (brahmins,<br />Kshatriyas, Shudras etc). In Rig Veda, it is very<br />clear people from all communities composed it and used<br />it. Women also composed Vedas (Lopamudra, Vakyarumbini<br />etc). Shukla Yajur Veda clearly says that Vedas are<br />for every one. </p>
<p>In one part of the Vedas it shows how a hunter clan<br />will perform a Vedic ritual for the benefit of other<br />clans. </p>
<p>What has gone wrong: Over period of time, we have<br />come out of those Vedic values and become self<br />centered and dogmatic. That is why we have so much of<br />fights in name of castes etc. Vedas never banned<br />Ekalavya from learning from Drona or Karna fighting<br />Arjuna. It was the law books that they followed that<br />time, made so. We have to clearly differentiate<br />between Vedas &amp; law books of various times. </p>
<p>What we should do: I think it is our main duty to<br />know the spiritual and social relevance of Vedas and<br />reform hindu society to the original greatness. This<br />will make everyone who has the willingness and ability<br />to do sadhana to become "spiritual gurus" and not by<br />birth. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons, that the workshops on<br />Vedas are organsied in various places. That is why i<br />sent the invite to our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group as members of this<br />elite group can easily cognize and be a reform agent<br />in the society. </acronym></p>

<p>6. Re: Aryan Dravidian<br />Posted by: "sridhar rathinam" <br /><a href="mailto:sridhar_rathinam@yahoo.co.uk">sridhar_rathinam@yahoo.co.uk</a> </p>
<p>Dear All<br />I know people all get fired up about the Aryan<br />invasion theory Vedic Civilisation etc</p>
<p>I dont think its wrong in acknowledging your culture<br />has gained or lost due to foreign influences</p>
<p>A good example is Britain there were native Celts<br />who were invaded by Vikings,Roman, Saxon and all had<br />an impression on their civilisation</p>
<p>The way I see Indian History is The Vedic<br />Civilisation was Indian The harappan civilisation was<br />Indian May be Dravidian and there was influence of<br />Nomadic migrants from Mid Asia You can call them<br />Aryans</p>
<p>There is no denying the fact that Indus civilisation<br />was an advanced Civilisation...And the different<br />physical aspects of north indians versus south<br />indians....</p>
<p>May be the complexion and charectorisation might be<br />due to later intermigling with the persians and<br />afghans or maybe they were there before..</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Sri</p>

<p>Dear Satish<br />very interesting<br />Christianity has flourished where other have not<br />because it was flexible not by choice...today there<br />are many sects of christianity but a jehovahs witness<br />whether he is from israel or mexico or ramnad is the<br />same same is for catholics...</p>
<p>the same is for shia and sunni muslims</p>
<p>but they coma under one large umbrella</p>
<p>your arguement is ok for subgroups like saivites<br />vaishnavaithes and sakthas but not for castes</p>
<p>castes are a great achievement of india!!!! </p>
<p>A nadar can be the santhome church father or so can<br />be a dalit theres nothing stopping that but they have<br />to be of that belief ie Jesuit,Salesian and thousand<br />others...</p>
<p>I throw the same coin at you if anyone could be a<br />brahman by vedic rules eg valmiki and vyasa all the<br />govt has done is do the same isnt it....</p>
<p>but in the same vedic tradition eklalaivan couldnt<br />be coached by drona or karna couldnt fight arjuna<br />becuase they were not ksathriyas</p>
<p>two standards??? </p>

<p>if you happen to open the file in wikipedia about popes there is a <br />seperate section on popes who were lusty and murderers.</p>

        <p>Dear Satish<br />very interesting<br />Christianity has flourished where other have not because it was flexible not by choice...today there are many sects of christianity but a jehovahs witness whether he is from israel or mexico or ramnad is the same same is for catholics...</p>
<p>the same is for shia and sunni muslims</p>
<p>but they coma under one large umbrella</p>
<p>your arguement is ok for subgroups like saivites vaishnavaithes and sakthas but not for castes</p>
<p>castes are a great achievement of india!!!! </p>
<p>A nadar can be the santhome church father or so can be a dalit theres nothing stopping that but they have to be of that belief ie Jesuit,Salesian and thousand others...</p>
<p>I throw the same coin at you if anyone could be a brahman by vedic rules eg valmiki and vyasa all the govt has done is do the same isnt it....</p>
<p>but in the same vedic tradition eklalaivan couldnt be coached by drona or karna couldnt fight arjuna becuase they were not ksathriyas</p>
<p>two standards???</p>

        <p>hi</p>
<p>I recently visited madurai. my client there showed me photographs of a <br />newly constructed kanaka durga temple in the outskirts getting very <br />popular.</p>
<p>the person who built it, maintains it as the poojari and also tells an <br />oracle is a MUSLIM</p>
<p>I also know a lot of christians who go to thirupathi.</p>
<p>but when a christian or a muslim gets into the temple as in the case <br />of mary jasmine we " purify the temple"<br />no sir no. we cant have it both ways</p>

<p>        Nanda, </p>
<p>        I understand your point.Ok. you say there is not caste in <br />  other <br />        religion. appo eppadi sir chatholic nadar non-catholic nadar <br />        picturela varanga...caste illana nadar mattum engirundhu <br />        vandhanga. .and Nadar is basically a hindu caste and how cam <br />        christians have that caste when they claim that christianity <br />  do <br />    not <br />        have caste.marubadiyum idikkala.. I remember one joke fwd in <br />        emails....a person travelling in the last compartment of the <br />    train <br />        wrote a letter to the station master..."Its difficult to getin <br />    and <br />        out of the last compartment, when the train stops in the <br />  station <br />    as <br />        the last compartment is outside the platform. So henceforth <br />    there <br />        should be no last compartment in trains." adhe mathiri <br />      christinatyla <br />        caste kedayathu..adhanala nadar christians also can become <br />    priest. </p>
<p>        and saying that any catholic can become a priest is as good as <br />        saying any brahmin can become a priest. I dont find any <br />    difference. <br />        Hinduismla brahmins oru sect-na,christinaityla catholics oru <br />    sect. <br />        avvalavuthan. I really dont understand how you find equality <br />  in <br />        christian catholics and not in Hindus? </p>
<p>        And like Dhiwakar pointed out, conversion is not just by <br />      belief..its <br />        by money power. Every month, please note every month, any one <br />    state <br />        in India gets around 3500 crore rupees for missionary <br />    activities. </p>
<p>        I am totally for a society where equality is practiced. I will <br />    be <br />        the first person to support if you mean a REAL equal society. <br />    But <br />        discriminating Hindus and uplifting others...this is not <br />      equality.If <br />        the govt. had come with a rule stating that any person who is <br />        qualified for a particular religion's priesthood can become <br />  the <br />        priest of that particular religion, I am 100% for it. <br />  Targeting <br />      only <br />        Hindus...its a shame for everyone of us, because we were, we <br />  are <br />      and <br />        we will be backboneless creatures.</p>
<p>        Dhiwakar, the sections you have posted..gavanichiya...equality <br />      pathi <br />        nalla ezhuthitu..kadaisila our gundu podaranga. Whatever the <br />    govt. <br />        feels as equality is equality. so govt. has the utmost power <br />  to <br />        overrule anything, whihc our politicians do very well.</p>

        <p>satish/diwakar/others(Lets get them also involved)... :)</p>
<p>I never said that there is no caste-ism in other religions. Even though christianity preaches equality, christians as people practice sect-ism, caste-ism, group-ism, seperate-isms in their own ways. </p>
<p>Every other set of people or group practices "isms" in an way in which people on top are able to control directly or indirectly or covertly also ...</p>
<p>I think I will have to quote myself again "In the Church or in the college, anyone wanting to take up priesthood can join and grow to be a priest", but to be a Pope, there are other sets of critierias, try to read "Angels &amp; Demons" by Dan Brown, it will give you a small hindsight into that.</p>
<p>But in our Hindu religion, to be a priest and to be accepted inside a well known temple, your caste is the primary acceptance factor. Unless its a village temple priests, people from other castes are not allowed to be a priest, even if you are well versed in vedas, practicies and also practice it zealously.. </p>
<p>Think it over, also there could be other people who are probably feeling offended by our comments here.. </p>
<p>I am of the opinion that customs and rules are guidelines, but not to be used for filtering out people on the basis of birth.</p>

<p>  I am totally for a society where equality is practiced. I will be <br />  the first person to support if you mean a REAL equal society.

<p>satish, namma rendu groupla oru aalu extra kidaichitaaru...nandavodu <br />moovaraanom....</p>
<p>endha oru puratchiyum needikkaadhu.. maatram has to be through <br />change in mentality which would be slow....</p>
<p>industrial revolution , communist revolution , french revolution, <br />white &amp; green revolution , naxal revolution everything has own <br />repurcussions which we people feel bad....</p>
<p>kannagi was a revolutionary... but after that were there no <br />kovalans??? nothing like it....</p>
<p>so revolutions wil bring change may be for a very short term.. </p>
<p>thi.ka people udaichufied pillaiyars.. but what happened?? pillaiyar <br />koil were built in all theru ... mukukku mukku pillaiyar koil dhaan <br />namma oorla.....</p>
<p>also mr. nanda, just by making everybody as priests, we cannot kill <br />the caste demons...</p>
<p>do you think conversion is just based on touching god's idol in <br />temples? </p>
<p>conversion has a lot of economic implications too sir.. evvalavu <br />dollar background la puraludhunnu ungalukku nallaave <br />therinjirukkumnnnu ninaikkaren....</p>
<p>conversion does not happen by volition.. rather it happens by <br />compulsion.. </p>
<p>it is being compulsorilly sold as if it is a product. people fail to <br />understand that every religion is a way of life..</p>
<p>also understand, priesthood is based upon grants given by kings to <br />certain families to perform poojai for generations..</p>
<p>and it is the right of each family to perform poojai in temples of <br />antiquity....</p>
<p>how do you think , we can alter their rights just by a signature..?? <br />arent we denying them the promise our great kings say like Rajaraja <br />gave them???</p>
<p>may be new temples which are being built can have non brahmin <br />priests.. let us try that....</p>
<p>reg DK voicing for human rights.. really funny..</p>
<p>these people have really different agenda sir...</p>
<p>they want to divert people from really serious issues... rather want <br />the people's energy to be focussed on trivial issues like this and <br />divert their attention from rather important ones....</p>

<p>  Hinduism madhiri flexible aana religion kidaiyave kidaiyaadhu... <br />  purinjukkonga....</p>
<p>  brahmins are a sect based on profession.... as satish said earlier, <br />  people become brahmins only by their deeds... the great saint <br />  viswamitra who gave the gayathri mantram to the world is <br />  a "kshatriya" sir.. purinjukkonga....</p>
<p>  also, no people compel brahmins to be the priest... we are talking <br />  here about "core competency" sir.... core competency anybody can <br />  develop and anybody can replace and be replaced...</p>
<p>  so , brahmin dominating here.. there and everywhere is all <br />  nonsense.... </p>
<p>  These politicians want vote... and to get the vote and keep people <br />in <br />  the dark so that whatever thing they do go unnoticed, these people <br />  find a easy vehicle called brahmin bashin... for that matter hindu <br />  bashing...</p>
<p>  these people are very actively supported by other religions <br />also.....</p>
<p>  when da vinci code was banned in TN, dinamalar carried an article <br />  about tamil books which contain similar stuff as that of the <br />movie... <br />  all these books were written by christians only ... yet nobody <br />wants <br />  to take notice of that and even mention that...</p>
<p>  that is because only hindu bashing sells and hindu bashing works...</p>
<p>  in vijay TV when there was a debate on all people becoming priests, <br />  the funny part was that the thi.ka (DK) people were there suporting <br />  all people can become priests...</p>
<p>  the basic question is , thi.ka people are anti god... then why do <br />  they voice for a matter relating to temple.. </p>
<p>  all that they can do in this issue is that take a stand <br />that "people <br />  should not go to temple at all".. there is a very good cause for <br />them <br />  in the issue to propogate their thoughts.. instead they are <br />indulging <br />  in this...</p>
<p>  this is a very ripe situation for them.. </p>
<p>  thi.ka people pls note this.. this a very good idea for you...</p>

<p>    Hi Nanda,<br />    Good point. This has been discussed in length many a times. <br />  Hinduism <br />    or rather sanathan dharma never prohibited anyone form getting in <br />    any varnam. varnam was never based on birth...ex. Valmiki, Vyasa <br />  and <br />    many other rishis were not brahmins by birth but they were <br />brahmins <br />    by their deads...like they elevated or in todays sense learned <br />the <br />    trick of the trade to become brahmins. So anyone saying that <br />there <br />    is disparity in Hinduism is nonsense. please check the archives <br />for <br />    more heated debates on this (Priya vaishnava enga <br />    poyiteenga...thaniya thavikka vituteengale. stats exam mudinchi <br />    varennu ponneenga. varusham onnu achu..innum exam mudiyalaya ella <br />    neenga mudikaliya)</p>
<p>    I never knew catholics can become a preist in a protestant church <br />    and a protestant can become a priest in catholic church. nisamava?<br />    can an India, why indian, an asian become the pope at vatican?<br />    round katti adipangappa....though they follow the same bible they <br />    both cant get to gether. itha pathi en pesa matengareenga. But <br />you <br />    call christianity flexible and gives freedom to all. kashta <br />kalamda <br />    sami...</p>
<p>    anyone who has qualification can become a temple priest. A <br />welcome <br />    rule. Can the same govt. come out with a rule saying that anyone <br />  who <br />    is qualified can become the father/bishop of church? rendu naalla <br />    atchi kavundhudum.</p>
<p>    And the article posted by Mr.Bala on Ariyar...good one. <br />references <br />    to sangam literature on the work ariyar. Thanks a lot sir. This <br />    again proves that the version being spread..or rather the hatered <br />    being spread on the so called aryans are false. What do the <br />    advocates of aryan invasion theory says - aryans came and <br />conquered <br />    india, formed a new religion called Hinduism, created the <br />  varnasrama <br />    dharma and created disparity in the society. and these aryans are <br />    brahmins who suppressed others in the name of Manu dharma. aryans <br />    are brahmins and so anti-brahminical sentiments spread across the <br />    country. </p>
<p>    ellam sari...manu dharma pragaram...or varnasrama dharma states <br />  that <br />    only kshtriya can fight, brahmins do not fight. but all these <br />  theory <br />    says that the aryans fought with the dravidians. all sangam <br />    literature says tamil kings fought with aryans. appo aryans <br />eppadi <br />    sir brahmins aga mudiyum? they should be kshatryas and surely not <br />    brahmins. engiyo idikala...</p>
<p>    and all these references are only for Aryans. aryansnu orutharu <br />    erundha dravidas nu reference irukkanum illa...As venkatesh <br />always <br />    says, look at the contemporary history. Can anyone say that any <br />    Sanskrit literature or any north indian literature has reference <br />to <br />    the word 'dravida' or any war between tamil kings and aryan <br />kings? <br />  I <br />    am seriously asking this as I dont have a clue on this. There <br />  should <br />    be two sides of a coin..just with the word Aryan, we have <br />    consturcted a fort with no foundation. i strongly feel this topic <br />    neds much more research than jumping into conclusion, and until <br />    anything is concluded nothing is history. Irony is, in India, <br />even <br />  a <br />    theory, whether proved or not, is history. References to Aryan in <br />    sangam literature can mean something different or simply north <br />    indians(as the article states in many places) which we fail or <br />    rather dont want to think about. </p>
<p>    How many do you think, will learn the agamas and will willingly <br />  come <br />    and take the profession of a priest in a the temple. What will be <br />    the impact on the society? I have seen many small village temple, <br />    where a non-brahmin were priest, flourish and grow to pull large <br />    crowd and when it florishes, people look for a brahmin priest to <br />    replace the non-brahmin priest. When non-brahmins lay the <br />    foundation, have a comittee to develop the temple and administer <br />it <br />    etc. why they look for a brahmin priest for replacement? Did any <br />    brahmins go and dominate them? No sir..its basically in our <br />  culture. <br />    Though not known to the common man, people even today think that <br />    brahmins can do this job better than themselves.Why do non <br />brahmins <br />    call brahmin priet to perform pooja and marriage? no brahmin goes <br />    and influences them.. thats culture and religion. Govt. rules <br />  cannot <br />    change it. govt can only give a wrong meaning to the customs only <br />    for divide and rule policy. vote bank sir ellam vote bank. 'Dalit <br />    can become santhome church father' cannot fetch vote- it will <br />only <br />    split vote. </p>
<p>    As Dhiwakar said, hindu bashing, everyone will come..other <br />    topics .moooch... </p>
<p>    Venkatesh, <br />    I think I discussed with you about 'Paramartha Guru' stories in <br />one <br />    of our trips. Did you read the article "Westerners and Tamil' by <br />    Mr.Bala. Veeramamunivar than sir antha kathaya ezhuthinathu. <br />Hidden <br />    agenda, deface Hindu saints so that people disrespect Hindu <br />saints. <br />    Westerners, though contributed a lot to Tamil, had an hidden <br />agenda <br />    of conversion (missionary activities mentioned at many places in <br />  the <br />    article). So if they can shake the foundation of faith, they can <br />    easily penetrate. They did succeed to a large extent, and the <br />  impact <br />    is seen even today. </p>

<p>      Hi Satish/Diwakar,</p>
<p>      Some of the points in your email, really go to prove that as a <br />    culture we have been hypocrites and we have generally led to the <br />    growth of hypocritical people.. </p>
<p>      I was watching a vijay tv show on sunday "neeya - naana" about <br />    non-brahmins becomes priests in hindu temples.. but there was one <br />    thing that struck true to me was thatchristanity or catholicism <br />  grew <br />    because it allowed anyone to become a priest without a prejudice, <br />    thats where our culture fails, if it can allow anyone to become a <br />    priest, provided that he can prove that he has learnt the vedas <br />and <br />    is willing to provide guarantees about following the rigours of <br />    being a priest. why can't our madams and adheenams take over that <br />    role from govt and help in promoting peace, culture and religion <br />    amongst everyone without worrying about caste.. as long as the <br />    person is willing to perform his duties..</p>

<p>indha maadhiri situation ulagathile irukkumbodhu, eppadi other <br />communities are flexible nnu neenga statement vidareenga????</p>
<p>Hinduism madhiri flexible aana religion kidaiyave kidaiyaadhu... <br />purinjukkonga....</p>
<p>brahmins are a sect based on profession.... as satish said earlier, <br />people become brahmins only by their deeds... the great saint <br />viswamitra who gave the gayathri mantram to the world is <br />a "kshatriya" sir.. purinjukkonga....</p>
<p>also, no people compel brahmins to be the priest... we are talking <br />here about "core competency" sir.... core competency anybody can <br />develop and anybody can replace and be replaced...</p>
<p>so , brahmin dominating here.. there and everywhere is all <br />nonsense.... </p>
<p>These politicians want vote... and to get the vote and keep people in <br />the dark so that whatever thing they do go unnoticed, these people <br />find a easy vehicle called brahmin bashin... for that matter hindu <br />bashing...</p>
<p>these people are very actively supported by other religions also.....</p>
<p>when da vinci code was banned in TN, dinamalar carried an article <br />about tamil books which contain similar stuff as that of the movie... <br />all these books were written by christians only ... yet nobody wants <br />to take notice of that and even mention that...</p>
<p>that is because only hindu bashing sells and hindu bashing works...</p>
<p>in vijay TV when there was a debate on all people becoming priests, <br />the funny part was that the thi.ka (DK) people were there suporting <br />all people can become priests...</p>
<p>the basic question is , thi.ka people are anti god... then why do <br />they voice for a matter relating to temple.. </p>
<p>all that they can do in this issue is that take a stand that "people <br />should not go to temple at all".. there is a very good cause for them <br />in the issue to propogate their thoughts.. instead they are indulging <br />in this...</p>
<p>this is a very ripe situation for them.. </p>
<p>thi.ka people pls note this.. this a very good idea for you...</p>
<p>tha.mu.mu.ka was supporting coimbatore blasts.. they are part of the <br />ruling alliance now.. who is going to bell them..(nesa kumar pakkam)</p>
<p>ennavo ponga.. niraya vishayam have been kept under a veil and a <br />malicious propaganda has been perpetrated.....</p>
<p>in the northeast there are separatist groups entirely backed by the <br />church... idhukellaam enna solluveenga...</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Nanda,<br />  Good point. This has been discussed in length many a times. <br />Hinduism <br />  or rather sanathan dharma never prohibited anyone form getting in <br />  any varnam. varnam was never based on birth...ex. Valmiki, Vyasa <br />and <br />  many other rishis were not brahmins by birth but they were brahmins <br />  by their deads...like they elevated or in todays sense learned the <br />  trick of the trade to become brahmins. So anyone saying that there <br />  is disparity in Hinduism is nonsense. please check the archives for <br />  more heated debates on this (Priya vaishnava enga <br />  poyiteenga...thaniya thavikka vituteengale. stats exam mudinchi <br />  varennu ponneenga. varusham onnu achu..innum exam mudiyalaya ella <br />  neenga mudikaliya)</p>
<p>  I never knew catholics can become a preist in a protestant church <br />  and a protestant can become a priest in catholic church. nisamava?<br />  can an India, why indian, an asian become the pope at vatican?<br />  round katti adipangappa....though they follow the same bible they <br />  both cant get to gether. itha pathi en pesa matengareenga. But you <br />  call christianity flexible and gives freedom to all. kashta kalamda <br />  sami...</p>
<p>  anyone who has qualification can become a temple priest. A welcome <br />  rule. Can the same govt. come out with a rule saying that anyone <br />who <br />  is qualified can become the father/bishop of church? rendu naalla <br />  atchi kavundhudum.</p>
<p>  And the article posted by Mr.Bala on Ariyar...good one. references <br />  to sangam literature on the work ariyar. Thanks a lot sir. This <br />  again proves that the version being spread..or rather the hatered <br />  being spread on the so called aryans are false. What do the <br />  advocates of aryan invasion theory says - aryans came and conquered <br />  india, formed a new religion called Hinduism, created the <br />varnasrama <br />  dharma and created disparity in the society. and these aryans are <br />  brahmins who suppressed others in the name of Manu dharma. aryans <br />  are brahmins and so anti-brahminical sentiments spread across the <br />  country. </p>
<p>  ellam sari...manu dharma pragaram...or varnasrama dharma states <br />that <br />  only kshtriya can fight, brahmins do not fight. but all these <br />theory <br />  says that the aryans fought with the dravidians. all sangam <br />  literature says tamil kings fought with aryans. appo aryans eppadi <br />  sir brahmins aga mudiyum? they should be kshatryas and surely not <br />  brahmins. engiyo idikala...</p>
<p>  and all these references are only for Aryans. aryansnu orutharu <br />  erundha dravidas nu reference irukkanum illa...As venkatesh always <br />  says, look at the contemporary history. Can anyone say that any <br />  Sanskrit literature or any north indian literature has reference to <br />  the word 'dravida' or any war between tamil kings and aryan kings? <br />I <br />  am seriously asking this as I dont have a clue on this. There <br />should <br />  be two sides of a coin..just with the word Aryan, we have <br />  consturcted a fort with no foundation. i strongly feel this topic <br />  neds much more research than jumping into conclusion, and until <br />  anything is concluded nothing is history. Irony is, in India, even <br />a <br />  theory, whether proved or not, is history. References to Aryan in <br />  sangam literature can mean something different or simply north <br />  indians(as the article states in many places) which we fail or <br />  rather dont want to think about. </p>
<p>  How many do you think, will learn the agamas and will willingly <br />come <br />  and take the profession of a priest in a the temple. What will be <br />  the impact on the society? I have seen many small village temple, <br />  where a non-brahmin were priest, flourish and grow to pull large <br />  crowd and when it florishes, people look for a brahmin priest to <br />  replace the non-brahmin priest. When non-brahmins lay the <br />  foundation, have a comittee to develop the temple and administer it <br />  etc. why they look for a brahmin priest for replacement? Did any <br />  brahmins go and dominate them? No sir..its basically in our <br />culture. <br />  Though not known to the common man, people even today think that <br />  brahmins can do this job better than themselves.Why do non brahmins <br />  call brahmin priet to perform pooja and marriage? no brahmin goes <br />  and influences them.. thats culture and religion. Govt. rules <br />cannot <br />  change it. govt can only give a wrong meaning to the customs only <br />  for divide and rule policy. vote bank sir ellam vote bank. 'Dalit <br />  can become santhome church father' cannot fetch vote- it will only <br />  split vote. </p>
<p>  As Dhiwakar said, hindu bashing, everyone will come..other <br />  topics .moooch... </p>
<p>  Venkatesh, <br />  I think I discussed with you about 'Paramartha Guru' stories in one <br />  of our trips. Did you read the article "Westerners and Tamil' by <br />  Mr.Bala. Veeramamunivar than sir antha kathaya ezhuthinathu. Hidden <br />  agenda, deface Hindu saints so that people disrespect Hindu saints. <br />  Westerners, though contributed a lot to Tamil, had an hidden agenda <br />  of conversion (missionary activities mentioned at many places in <br />the <br />  article). So if they can shake the foundation of faith, they can <br />  easily penetrate. They did succeed to a large extent, and the <br />impact <br />  is seen even today. </p>

<p>    Hi Satish/Diwakar,</p>
<p>    Some of the points in your email, really go to prove that as a <br />  culture we have been hypocrites and we have generally led to the <br />  growth of hypocritical people.. </p>
<p>    I was watching a vijay tv show on sunday "neeya - naana" about <br />  non-brahmins becomes priests in hindu temples.. but there was one <br />  thing that struck true to me was thatchristanity or catholicism <br />grew <br />  because it allowed anyone to become a priest without a prejudice, <br />  thats where our culture fails, if it can allow anyone to become a <br />  priest, provided that he can prove that he has learnt the vedas and <br />  is willing to provide guarantees about following the rigours of <br />  being a priest. why can't our madams and adheenams take over that <br />  role from govt and help in promoting peace, culture and religion <br />  amongst everyone without worrying about caste.. as long as the <br />  person is willing to perform his duties..</p>

<p>of who i'm--I'm one of those earliest members who joined when Ram <br />started this group. Hats off to Ram. I went back in time to find out <br />how all this started and found a interesting thing. The predecessor <br />to this group was a discussion thread in forum hub. When Ram started <br />this group many replies in that forum were skeptical about it <br />success and Ram was sure about the groups success. Without any doubt <br />his conviction proved right. Even with the new group we were trying <br />to do a lot of stuff and going no where. With the help of our  <br />members like SPS, Dr.Sridhar, Gokul, Lavanya and lot others (due to <br />lack of space i'm leaving out some names) we now have a direction. <br />Even to this day, i use our group as an example of team work in our <br />like me don't post a lot but remain active. I don't post any replies <br />not because of disinterest , because ...Enakku onnumae theriyadhu :-<br />). Even our Krupa seems to slowed down these days. I really hope our <br />group moves to the next level as PSPV and becomes a name to recon <br />with when it comes to dealing with Tamil history and heritage. With <br />distinguished members like SPS sir, i'm sure we will get there.</p>

<p>Hinduism madhiri flexible aana religion kidaiyave kidaiyaadhu... <br />purinjukkonga....</p>
<p>brahmins are a sect based on profession.... as satish said earlier, <br />people become brahmins only by their deeds... the great saint <br />viswamitra who gave the gayathri mantram to the world is <br />a "kshatriya" sir.. purinjukkonga....</p>
<p>also, no people compel brahmins to be the priest... we are talking <br />here about "core competency" sir.... core competency anybody can <br />develop and anybody can replace and be replaced...</p>
<p>so , brahmin dominating here.. there and everywhere is all <br />nonsense.... </p>
<p>These politicians want vote... and to get the vote and keep people in <br />the dark so that whatever thing they do go unnoticed, these people <br />find a easy vehicle called brahmin bashin... for that matter hindu <br />bashing...</p>
<p>these people are very actively supported by other religions also.....</p>
<p>when da vinci code was banned in TN, dinamalar carried an article <br />about tamil books which contain similar stuff as that of the movie... <br />all these books were written by christians only ... yet nobody wants <br />to take notice of that and even mention that...</p>
<p>that is because only hindu bashing sells and hindu bashing works...</p>
<p>in vijay TV when there was a debate on all people becoming priests, <br />the funny part was that the thi.ka (DK) people were there suporting <br />all people can become priests...</p>
<p>the basic question is , thi.ka people are anti god... then why do <br />they voice for a matter relating to temple.. </p>
<p>all that they can do in this issue is that take a stand that "people <br />should not go to temple at all".. there is a very good cause for them <br />in the issue to propogate their thoughts.. instead they are indulging <br />in this...</p>
<p>this is a very ripe situation for them.. </p>
<p>thi.ka people pls note this.. this a very good idea for you...</p>
<p>tha.mu.mu.ka was supporting coimbatore blasts.. they are part of the <br />ruling alliance now.. who is going to bell them..(nesa kumar pakkam)</p>
<p>ennavo ponga.. niraya vishayam have been kept under a veil and a <br />malicious propaganda has been perpetrated.....</p>
<p>in the northeast there are separatist groups entirely backed by the <br />church... idhukellaam enna solluveenga...</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Nanda,<br />  Good point. This has been discussed in length many a times. <br />Hinduism <br />  or rather sanathan dharma never prohibited anyone form getting in <br />  any varnam. varnam was never based on birth...ex. Valmiki, Vyasa <br />and <br />  many other rishis were not brahmins by birth but they were brahmins <br />  by their deads...like they elevated or in todays sense learned the <br />  trick of the trade to become brahmins. So anyone saying that there <br />  is disparity in Hinduism is nonsense. please check the archives for <br />  more heated debates on this (Priya vaishnava enga <br />  poyiteenga...thaniya thavikka vituteengale. stats exam mudinchi <br />  varennu ponneenga. varusham onnu achu..innum exam mudiyalaya ella <br />  neenga mudikaliya)</p>
<p>  I never knew catholics can become a preist in a protestant church <br />  and a protestant can become a priest in catholic church. nisamava?<br />  can an India, why indian, an asian become the pope at vatican?<br />  round katti adipangappa....though they follow the same bible they <br />  both cant get to gether. itha pathi en pesa matengareenga. But you <br />  call christianity flexible and gives freedom to all. kashta kalamda <br />  sami...</p>
<p>  anyone who has qualification can become a temple priest. A welcome <br />  rule. Can the same govt. come out with a rule saying that anyone <br />who <br />  is qualified can become the father/bishop of church? rendu naalla <br />  atchi kavundhudum.</p>
<p>  And the article posted by Mr.Bala on Ariyar...good one. references <br />  to sangam literature on the work ariyar. Thanks a lot sir. This <br />  again proves that the version being spread..or rather the hatered <br />  being spread on the so called aryans are false. What do the <br />  advocates of aryan invasion theory says - aryans came and conquered <br />  india, formed a new religion called Hinduism, created the <br />varnasrama <br />  dharma and created disparity in the society. and these aryans are <br />  brahmins who suppressed others in the name of Manu dharma. aryans <br />  are brahmins and so anti-brahminical sentiments spread across the <br />  country. </p>
<p>  ellam sari...manu dharma pragaram...or varnasrama dharma states <br />that <br />  only kshtriya can fight, brahmins do not fight. but all these <br />theory <br />  says that the aryans fought with the dravidians. all sangam <br />  literature says tamil kings fought with aryans. appo aryans eppadi <br />  sir brahmins aga mudiyum? they should be kshatryas and surely not <br />  brahmins. engiyo idikala...</p>
<p>  and all these references are only for Aryans. aryansnu orutharu <br />  erundha dravidas nu reference irukkanum illa...As venkatesh always <br />  says, look at the contemporary history. Can anyone say that any <br />  Sanskrit literature or any north indian literature has reference to <br />  the word 'dravida' or any war between tamil kings and aryan kings? <br />I <br />  am seriously asking this as I dont have a clue on this. There <br />should <br />  be two sides of a coin..just with the word Aryan, we have <br />  consturcted a fort with no foundation. i strongly feel this topic <br />  neds much more research than jumping into conclusion, and until <br />  anything is concluded nothing is history. Irony is, in India, even <br />a <br />  theory, whether proved or not, is history. References to Aryan in <br />  sangam literature can mean something different or simply north <br />  indians(as the article states in many places) which we fail or <br />  rather dont want to think about. </p>
<p>  How many do you think, will learn the agamas and will willingly <br />come <br />  and take the profession of a priest in a the temple. What will be <br />  the impact on the society? I have seen many small village temple, <br />  where a non-brahmin were priest, flourish and grow to pull large <br />  crowd and when it florishes, people look for a brahmin priest to <br />  replace the non-brahmin priest. When non-brahmins lay the <br />  foundation, have a comittee to develop the temple and administer it <br />  etc. why they look for a brahmin priest for replacement? Did any <br />  brahmins go and dominate them? No sir..its basically in our <br />culture. <br />  Though not known to the common man, people even today think that <br />  brahmins can do this job better than themselves.Why do non brahmins <br />  call brahmin priet to perform pooja and marriage? no brahmin goes <br />  and influences them.. thats culture and religion. Govt. rules <br />cannot <br />  change it. govt can only give a wrong meaning to the customs only <br />  for divide and rule policy. vote bank sir ellam vote bank. 'Dalit <br />  can become santhome church father' cannot fetch vote- it will only <br />  split vote. </p>
<p>  As Dhiwakar said, hindu bashing, everyone will come..other <br />  topics .moooch... </p>
<p>  Venkatesh, <br />  I think I discussed with you about 'Paramartha Guru' stories in one <br />  of our trips. Did you read the article "Westerners and Tamil' by <br />  Mr.Bala. Veeramamunivar than sir antha kathaya ezhuthinathu. Hidden <br />  agenda, deface Hindu saints so that people disrespect Hindu saints. <br />  Westerners, though contributed a lot to Tamil, had an hidden agenda <br />  of conversion (missionary activities mentioned at many places in <br />the <br />  article). So if they can shake the foundation of faith, they can <br />  easily penetrate. They did succeed to a large extent, and the <br />impact <br />  is seen even today. </p>

<p>    Hi Satish/Diwakar,</p>
<p>    Some of the points in your email, really go to prove that as a <br />  culture we have been hypocrites and we have generally led to the <br />  growth of hypocritical people.. </p>
<p>    I was watching a vijay tv show on sunday "neeya - naana" about <br />  non-brahmins becomes priests in hindu temples.. but there was one <br />  thing that struck true to me was thatchristanity or catholicism <br />grew <br />  because it allowed anyone to become a priest without a prejudice, <br />  thats where our culture fails, if it can allow anyone to become a <br />  priest, provided that he can prove that he has learnt the vedas and <br />  is willing to provide guarantees about following the rigours of <br />  being a priest. why can't our madams and adheenams take over that <br />  role from govt and help in promoting peace, culture and religion <br />  amongst everyone without worrying about caste.. as long as the <br />  person is willing to perform his duties..</p>

        <p>Wow...We have come a long way. Even if half of our members are active we are doing a great job. For those of you who have no clue of who i'm--I'm one of those earliest members who joined when Ram started this group. Hats off to Ram. I went back in time to find out how all this started and found a interesting thing. The predecessor to this group was a discussion thread in forum hub. When Ram started this group many replies in that forum were skeptical about it success and Ram was sure about the groups success. Without any doubt his conviction proved right. Even with the new group we were tryingto do a lot of stuff and going no where. With the help of our members like SPS, Dr.Sridhar, Gokul, Lavanya and lot others (due to lack of space i'm leaving out some names) we now have a direction. Even to this day, i use ounal experience i would say people like me don't post a lot but remain active. I don't post any replies not because of disinterest , because ...Enakku onnumae theriyadhu :-). Even our Krupa seems to slowed down these days. I really hope our group moves to the next level as PSPV and becomes a name to recon with when it comes to dealing with Tamil history and heritage. With distinguished members like SPS sir, i'm sure we will get there.</p>
<p>Finally - AAdI 18 VAZHTHUKKAL (Appada... now i'm an active member)</p>
<p>Note: In case if someone is wondering about my contribution to this group -Bunch of failed attachment mails to Sathya and spoiling Krupa's career with an OCR. <br />Thanks,<br />Arul Prasad</p>

        <p>Hi Nanda,<br />Good point. This has been discussed in length many a times. Hinduism <br />or rather sanathan dharma never prohibited anyone form getting in <br />any varnam. varnam was never based on birth...ex. Valmiki, Vyasa and <br />many other rishis were not brahmins by birth but they were brahmins <br />by their deads...like they elevated or in todays sense learned the <br />trick of the trade to become brahmins. So anyone saying that there <br />is disparity in Hinduism is nonsense. please check the archives for <br />more heated debates on this (Priya vaishnava enga <br />poyiteenga...thaniya thavikka vituteengale. stats exam mudinchi <br />varennu ponneenga. varusham onnu achu..innum exam mudiyalaya ella <br />neenga mudikaliya)</p>
<p>I never knew catholics can become a preist in a protestant church <br />and a protestant can become a priest in catholic church. nisamava?<br />can an India, why indian, an asian become the pope at vatican?<br />round katti adipangappa....though they follow the same bible they <br />both cant get to gether. itha pathi en pesa matengareenga. But you <br />call christianity flexible and gives freedom to all. kashta kalamda <br />sami...</p>
<p>anyone who has qualification can become a temple priest. A welcome <br />rule. Can the same govt. come out with a rule saying that anyone who <br />is qualified can become the father/bishop of church? rendu naalla <br />atchi kavundhudum.</p>
<p>And the article posted by Mr.Bala on Ariyar...good one. references <br />to sangam literature on the work ariyar. Thanks a lot sir. This <br />again proves that the version being spread..or rather the hatered <br />being spread on the so called aryans are false. What do the <br />advocates of aryan invasion theory says - aryans came and conquered <br />india, formed a new religion called Hinduism, created the varnasrama <br />dharma and created disparity in the society. and these aryans are <br />brahmins who suppressed others in the name of Manu dharma. aryans <br />are brahmins and so anti-brahminical sentiments spread across the <br />country. </p>
<p>ellam sari...manu dharma pragaram...or varnasrama dharma states that <br />only kshtriya can fight, brahmins do not fight. but all these theory <br />says that the aryans fought with the dravidians. all sangam <br />literature says tamil kings fought with aryans. appo aryans eppadi <br />sir brahmins aga mudiyum? they should be kshatryas and surely not <br />brahmins. engiyo idikala...</p>
<p>and all these references are only for Aryans. aryansnu orutharu <br />erundha dravidas nu reference irukkanum illa...As venkatesh always <br />says, look at the contemporary history. Can anyone say that any <br />Sanskrit literature or any north indian literature has reference to <br />the word 'dravida' or any war between tamil kings and aryan kings? I <br />am seriously asking this as I dont have a clue on this. There should <br />be two sides of a coin..just with the word Aryan, we have <br />consturcted a fort with no foundation. i strongly feel this topic <br />neds much more research than jumping into conclusion, and until <br />anything is concluded nothing is history. Irony is, in India, even a <br />theory, whether proved or not, is history. References to Aryan in <br />sangam literature can mean something different or simply north <br />indians(as the article states in many places) which we fail or <br />rather dont want to think about. </p>
<p>How many do you think, will learn the agamas and will willingly come <br />and take the profession of a priest in a the temple. What will be <br />the impact on the society? I have seen many small village temple, <br />where a non-brahmin were priest, flourish and grow to pull large <br />crowd and when it florishes, people look for a brahmin priest to <br />replace the non-brahmin priest. When non-brahmins lay the <br />foundation, have a comittee to develop the temple and administer it <br />etc. why they look for a brahmin priest for replacement? Did any <br />brahmins go and dominate them? No sir..its basically in our culture. <br />Though not known to the common man, people even today think that <br />brahmins can do this job better than themselves.Why do non brahmins <br />call brahmin priet to perform pooja and marriage? no brahmin goes <br />and influences them.. thats culture and religion. Govt. rules cannot <br />change it. govt can only give a wrong meaning to the customs only <br />for divide and rule policy. vote bank sir ellam vote bank. 'Dalit <br />can become santhome church father' cannot fetch vote- it will only <br />split vote. </p>
<p>As Dhiwakar said, hindu bashing, everyone will come..other <br />topics .moooch... </p>
<p>Venkatesh, <br />I think I discussed with you about 'Paramartha Guru' stories in one <br />of our trips. Did you read the article "Westerners and Tamil' by <br />Mr.Bala. Veeramamunivar than sir antha kathaya ezhuthinathu. Hidden <br />agenda, deface Hindu saints so that people disrespect Hindu saints. <br />Westerners, though contributed a lot to Tamil, had an hidden agenda <br />of conversion (missionary activities mentioned at many places in the <br />article). So if they can shake the foundation of faith, they can <br />easily penetrate. They did succeed to a large extent, and the impact <br />is seen even today. </p>

        <p>Hi Satish/Diwakar,</p>
<p>Some of the points in your email, really go to prove that as a culture we have been hypocrites and we have generally led to the growth of hypocritical people.. </p>
<p>I was watching a vijay tv show on sunday "neeya - naana" about non-brahmins becomes priests in hindu temples.. but there was one thing that struck true to me was thatchristanity or catholicism grew because it allowed anyone to become a priest without a prejudice, thats where our culture fails, if it can allow anyone to become a priest, provided that he can prove that he has learnt the vedas and is willing to provide guarantees about following the rigours of being a priest. why can't our madams and adheenams take over that role from govt and help in promoting peace, culture and religion amongst everyone without worrying about caste.. as long as the person is willing to perform his duties..</p>
<p>Regards<br />Nanda</p>

<p>Dear Madan, </p>
<p>Can we try one to one mail to those who contributed in the first <br />1000 mails but not responding now. I am sure we will have atleast <br />100 left out over there.. who are really Seniors to us..</p>
<p>I suggest we send Greetings to them from our Group.. <br />within next 2 - 3 days ..</p>
