<p>"Ariyar" in the Ancient Tamil Literature</p>
<p>K. V. Ramakrishna Rao</p>
<p>1. Introduction: Ever since the advent of "Ariyar" in Indian history, <br />the word "Aryan" has assumed significance and far-fetching linguistic <br />and racial connotations. Then came the advent of "Dravidians". <br />Caldwell's linguistic invention was given a racial twist by the <br />westerners and Indian scholars, though the concept of race and <br />language are two separate entities. Leaving these hypotheses and <br />theories aside, an attempt is made in this paper to study the <br />word "Ariyar" fund in the ancient Tamil literature, popularly known <br />as Tamil Sangam literature. In the process of understanding the past, <br />there have been persistent and insistent attempts in historiography <br />to import later day ideas, concepts and theories to reflect back on <br />the past events leading to diversified and contradicting situation.  <br />But, here the approach has been restricted to get the meaning of the <br />word "Ariyar" as found in the ancient Tamil literature.</p>
<p>2. In the ancient Tamil literature, the <br />word "Ariyar", "Ariyan", "Ariya" etc., found in various places withy <br />their other forms and have been used both as nouns and adjectives. As <br />in recent times, diametrically opposite views have been expressed1 <br />about the inclusion of the Tamil epics Cilappatikaram and Manimekalai <br />within the ambit of Sangam literature, the discussion is restricted <br />to Ettutogai (the eight anthologies), Pattupattu (the Ten poems) and <br />Padinen Kizh Kanakku (the Eighteen Minor works). Now, let us see, <br />what these poems say about "Ariyar".</p>
<p>3. Natrinai: It is the heading the list of Ettuttogai and its general <br />theme is love. The word "Ariyar" appears in the 170th poem, sung by <br />an unknown poet. The companion of the heroin of the poem warts that <br />the hero might be seduced by the beautiful lonely dancing girl. She <br />compares the victory of the Virali (the dancer), who came to a <br />festival clad in a leaf-garment, over her group to the fact that the <br />famous town of Mullur, the "Ariya" soldiers swarmed, but ran away <br />before the lance-battalion of Malayan (a Cheran), who unsheathed a <br />that the people who came from the north to attack Cheras were known <br />as "Ariyar". </p>
<p>4. Kuruntogai: Literally meaning `a collection of short poems', it <br />comes next and its theme is also love. The word "Ariyar" appears in <br />the verse 7, line 3. Here, it is described how "Ariyars" dance on a <br />tied rope according to the beatings of a drum. "The forest full of <br />bamboos were rattled the white ripe seeds of shivering vakai tree <br />(Sirisa tree) tossed by the wind like the drumming of the "Ariyar" <br />dancing on the rope". Therefore, here it is evident that "Ariyar" <br />refers to a group of jugglers or tumblers, who performed acrobatics.</p>
<p>5. Paditruppattu (the Ten tens): It gives more information <br />about `Ariyar' in historical setting. The entire extant collection of <br />poems with the deeds and exploits of the Chera Kings. The first and <br />tenth Tens are not available. In the Second Ten, the Patigam <br />(Preface) describes how Imayavaramban Nedunjeraladhan engraved his <br />royal sign `bow', which figures on his flag, on the top of the <br />Himalayas (lines 4-7). Having roaring oceans has his boundaries <br />(imizh kadal velittamizhagam), he ruled Tamizhagam (the Tamil <br />country) in such a way o excel the other nadus (countries). He <br />made `Ariyar' bow before him, who were having very great name (fame <br />and heritage).</p>
<p>5.1. In the Second Ten, the 11th verse details as how the very famous <br />Himalayas abound with "Ariyas". Hence, scholars give two different <br />meanings for the `Ariyar':</p>
<p>`Ariyar" = Munivar (rishis) and <br />"Ariyar' = `Ariya mannar' ( Aryan kings) .</p>
<p>The hillside was resplendent with densely and well grown trees of <br />erthrina indica (mullu murukka), a kind of citrus and the yak <br />sleeping there would dream of waterfalls and sweet smelling grass. <br />The Himalayas with such fertility was filled with many rishis. In <br />between the Himalayas (in the north) and Kumari in the South, there <br />wee Kings who boasted their valour but they were conquered by <br />Nedunjeraladhan. The meaning is thus rendered, "You quelled the <br />valour of those who called themselves monarchs of the land between <br />Camorin in the South and the famous Himalayas, where the Ariyas2 <br />abound and yak sleeps on the hills covered thick with the Oleander <br />and dreams of the broad mountain stream and the narandam (lemon-<br />grass)"</p>
<p>5.2. In fifth Ten, the patigam mentions `vadavar', i,e, the people of <br />north and `Ariya Annal' i.e, head of Ariya Kings. It describes how <br />the kings of the north were afraid of Kadal Prakkottiya Senguttuvan. <br />He marched with his army to bring a good stone for chiseling an image <br />of the goddess of chastity. He came across a head or chief of Ariya <br />Kings, while passing through forests, and defeated him. Then, he <br />brought a stone and washed it in waters of the Ganges. While coming <br />back, he stayed at Irumbil, destroyed Viyaur and Kodungur. He also <br />killed a king named Pazhaiyon.</p>
<p>5.3. In the same fifth Ten, the 43rd verse mentions the defeat of <br />kings who were ruling between the Himalayas in the north and Kumari <br />in the south as boundaries. However, the names of the kings or the <br />countries thus defeated are not given in the poem. In the padigam, <br />the kings are mentioned as the `vadavar' (the Kings of north), the <br />Chiefs of `Ariyar' are called `Ariya Annal', but here they are <br />generally mentioned as `Ariya arasar', i.e, the Kings between the <br />Himalayas and Kumari.</p>
<p>5.4. In Seventh Ten, the 68th poem narrates how the people who were <br />living in the north or northern direction, were leading a fearless <br />and happy life. The _expression used to denote them is `vadapula <br />vazhnar'.</p>
<p>5.5. So from the description of Paditruppattu, we can see <br />that `Ariyar' are ?</p>
<p>? `the Kings of the north', <br />? `Rishis of the Himalayas', <br />? `the Kings between the boundaries of Himalayas and Kumari' and <br />? `the people of the north or northern direction of Tamilagam'.</p>
<p>6. Agananuru (or Neduntogai): It also gives more details <br />about `Ariyar'. `Ariyars' capture elephants by the use of trained <br />female elephants. A public woman takes a vow that she would chain her <br />hero with her hair just as the `Ariyar' make the wild elephant <br />domesticated with the she-elephant. Mullaippattu throws light on <br />their employment by the kings of Tamilagam to train elephants.</p>
<p>6.1. In another poem, a harlot wishes her bangles may be broken just <br />like the army of `Ariyars', which was defeated by the Kurumba bowmen <br />who fought under the Cholas, with their shower of arrows, victorious <br />spears and the black buckler. Here, also the names of the <br />defeated `Ariyars' are not given, but it is mentioned that they were <br />defeated at Vallam (Tanjore).</p>
<p>6.2. Paranar3 in his poem eulogises Senguttuvan that he attacked the <br />Aryar so as to make them scream, carved his emblem bow on the very <br />famous mountain and chained the ferocious Kings. Here one can notice <br />that the name of the mountain is not specified and it is mentioned in <br />singular. As Himalayas are always mentioned in plural to denote a <br />chain of mountains, a doubt arises as to whether the poet actually <br />alludes to the Himalayas or to a certain `very famous, ancient and <br />well grown' mountain situated north of Tamizhagam in those days.</p>
<p>6.3. Agam.386 narrates how an Ariya wrestler was defeated by one <br />Panan. The Ariya wrestler was known as `Ariya Porunan' and Panan was <br />another wrestler, whose state was in the north of Tamizgagam <br />(Agam.325). Panan wrestled with Ariya Porunan and crushed his <br />shoulders and arms, the sight of which made Kanaiyan, the commander <br />of Chera army, feel ashamed.</p>
<p>6.5. So, according to Agananuru, `Ariyar' were ?</p>
<p>? the people who captured and trained elephants, <br />? who got defeated by the Cholas at Vallam, <br />? who were the Kings of the north, conquered and chained by <br />Senguttuvan and <br />? who were in possession of a mountain where gold was available.</p>
<p>As there was a wrestler known as `Ariya Porunan', the name should <br />imply either that he was an Ariya or he came from the north. But, it <br />should be noted that Panan, who defeated Ariya Porunan and came from <br />a state situated north of Tamizhagam, was not given the prefix <br />of `Ariya'. Therefore, it is evident that there were Ariya wrestlers, <br />just like Ariya jugglers, tumblers or rope dancers, elephant trainers <br />and trainers in Tamizhagam.</p>
<p>7. Purananuru: In one poem4, Kovur Kizhar, a Tamil poet, describes <br />how the kings of north were afraid of Cholan Naklankilli that they <br />were spending their nights without sleep. Marudanila Naganar, another <br />poet5 describes how Pandiyan Kudakartattutunjiya Maran Vazhudi was <br />having a chariot to wage a fierce war to kill the kings of north <br />(vadapula mannar). Actually, the poet eulogises Maran Vazhudi who is <br />said to have caused `northern kings to fade'. But, particular given <br />about the names of such northern kings or countries and the place or <br />places where he defeated them in the battles are not at all given. <br />There is a mention6 of a type of a sandal paste of `northern <br />mountain' (vadakundrattuchandanam), Agananuru also refers to this7. <br />But here also, the name of the northern mountain is not mentioned. <br />Thre important point to be noted is, though the <br />expressions `vadapulattarasar', `vadapulamannar' and `vadakundram' <br />are used to denote the kings of the north and northern mountain, the <br />prefix `Ariyar' is conspicuously missing. Therefore, it is very <br />evident that there were northern kings and northern mountains other <br />than Ariya kings of north and northern mountain of `Ariyar'.</p>
<p>8. Non-Tamilian people of North: In the case of non-Tamilian people, <br />specific names have been mentioned like Kosar8, Moriyar9, Nandar10, <br />Tondaiyar11, and Vadugar12. Kosars belonged to Tulu country and they <br />were living south of the Vindhya and near the shores of western <br />ocean. Nandar and Moriyar are no others but the Nandas and Mauryas of <br />north India. Tondaiyars were found in the forests of Vengadam hills <br />where elephants were abundant. So they went on expeditions, captured, <br />trained and formed them into a brigade. The trained elephants brought <br />firewood to the Rishis and they ate the food of their country only. <br />like Ariyars, as far as elephants are concerned. Vadugar were having <br />their lands beyond Vengadam and they spoke a different language. <br />Another point to be noted is that at one place (Puram. 378), the <br />Vadugars are denoted as `vada vadugar'. The term `vadugar' connotes <br />that they were from the north and hence the _expression `vada <br />vadugar' is very significant, as it actually denotes `northern group <br />of northerners'. This can be compared with the _expression `vada <br />Ariyar' and vadavariyar" denoting `northern Ariyar', but such <br />expressions are found in Silappathikaram and not in the Sangam <br />literature taken for discussion. But the important point to be noted <br />is the usage of `Ariyar', while the word `Ariyar' is generally used <br />to denote the people of north or the kings of north, the above <br />mentioned words Kosar, Nandar, Moriyar, Tondaiyar and Vadugar are <br />used to denote only particular groups of people who lived in the <br />north of Tamizhagam.</p>
<p>9. Arya and Ariya suffixes and prefixs: Epigraphic, numismatic and <br />literary evidences are abundant to show that the Sathavahanas were <br />ruling in the north of Tamizhagam with their intruding territories <br />extended up to Caddalore. The important point which should be <br />mentioned here is that the `Arya' endings in the names of the donees <br />are found only in the grants coming from the territory immediately <br />south of river Krishna (The Kondamudi, the Mayadavolu, the Hira <br />Hadagalli, the Kanteru Nandivarman I and the Mattapad grants). `Arya' <br />(venerable) as honorific prefix to the names of Buddhist and Jain <br />teachers and saints occurs in inscriptions all over India. Indeed the <br />Tamil epic Manumekhalai mentions Buddha as `Ariyan' (25-6). `Arya' as <br />an honorific title is found in the Hathigumpa inscription of <br />Kharavela13. `Arya' as initial part of personal names occur in Junnar <br />inscription inscription14 (Ayama), and in the Nagarjunakonda <br />inscription15 (Ayakotosiri) and Ayasiri, names of royal <br />ladies. `Aryadeva' is the name of the celebrated disciple16 of <br />Nagarjuna (3rd cent. CE), who spent a greater part of his life in <br />Andhradesha. But the earliest inscription to exhibit names with Arya-<br />ending is the Kondamudi grant of Jayavarman (3rd cent.CE), where all <br />doinees have names ending with `aja', as also found in the same <br />manner in the Mayadavola and Mattapad grants.</p>
<p>9.1. `Aja' is another form of Prakrit `Arya', Sanskrit `Arya' and <br />Tamil `Ayya', `Iyya', `Iyer' and `Ariyar'. `Ariyar' or `Ariya' <br />started as an honorific prefix anmd become a name-ending much the <br />same way as `sri' found in many inscriptions. And we can find the <br />same trend in Tamil literature, as in `Ariya Annal' (Head or chiuef <br />of Ariya Kings), `Ariya Porunan' (Arya wrestler), `Ariya Arasan <br />Bragadattan'17 (Ariya king named Bragadattan) and `Ariya Arasan Yazh <br />Brahmadattan'18 (Ariya king poet Brahmadattan). The word `Ayyar' <br />or `Iyer' is found in many places in ancient Tamil literature <br />including Tolkappiyam19, which is considered as the oldest extant <br />Tamil work. It is used to represent a teacher, brother, priest, <br />saint, andanan (Brahmana), superior, master or king, with veneration.</p>
<p>10. `Ariake': A reference to Periplus' `Ariaca' and <br />Ptolemy's `Ariake' has to be made, as it has direct bearing on the <br />discussion of `Ariyar' of the ancient Tamil literature. About the <br />name `Ariaca' of the Periplus, W. H. Scoff opines: "the word in the <br />text is very uncertain". Lassen thinks that the name <br />Sanskrit `Latica' (pronounced Larica) and included the land on both <br />sides of the gulf of Cambay20. Ptolemy (c.140 CE) calls the first <br />province of Tamil country going down from the north as `Lymyrice or <br />Dymirike'. He and the author of Periplus use it only as the name of <br />the Chera territory. The country north of it was to them `Ariake', <br />belongoing to the Aryas, in the restricted sense of Marathas. Taking <br />the other forms `Ariake Sadinon' and `Ariake of the Pirates', they <br />could easily have made out that `Ariake' referred to the country <br />later known as the Maharastra, then ruled over by the Satavahana <br />kings of the Andhra dynasty21. Therefore, it is evident that Ariake <br />or Aricca denotes `Akam' or the country of Ariyar who were ruling or <br />living immediately north of Dymirike or Tamizagam.</p>
<p>11. Himalayas of Ariyar: We have seen how some Tamil kings marched <br />towards the Himalayas to bring stones or to defeat the kings in <br />between the `Himalayas' and `Kumari', and inscribed their royal <br />emblems on it. Already it has been pointed out that the poets <br />expressions like `very famous, ancient and well grown' mountain <br />(Agam.396), `tall mountain with gold' (Agam.398), `a big stone' <br />(Puram.171) and a `tall mountain' (Puram.61), even without naming the <br />mountain, it is evident that the poets coisidered `Imaiyam' <br />or `Imayam' was a single mountain situated north of <br />Tamizhagam. `Imam' means snow, that is why, the Himalayas are called <br />so. But, in the Tamil literature, wherever the name `Imayam' is not <br />mentioned, it is also not mentioned that the `tall, ancient, very <br />famous and stony' mountain with gold is covered with snow. Everybody <br />knows that Himalayas are indeed very famous, ancient and `several <br />series of more or less parallel or converging ranges'. Also the poets <br />have not given the details how the kings climbed up the `Himalayas', <br />cut the required stone, brought it down, etc., except that `he washed <br />it in the waters of Ganges'. Therefore, it is evident that whenever <br />the name `Imayam' is not mentioned, we have to take it as a mountain <br />that was situated in the north of Tamizhagam.</p>
<p>12. Non-Tamil kings of north: The Hathigumpha inscription of <br />Kharavela, a king of Kalinga and a contemporary of the third or fifth <br />king of the Satavahana line, is the only epigraphic reference to the <br />kingdoms of the Tamil country after the Asoka inscription. Kharavela <br />ruled Kalinga in the first half of the second century BCE and in the <br />eleventh year of hid reign (c.155 BCE), he is said to have destroyed <br />a confederacy of Tamil states ? Tramiradesa sanghatanam [(T(r)mira, <br />Damira or Tamila] ? which was 113 years old (113+17) at the time and <br />had been a source of danger22. The Satavahanas were ruling, starting <br />with the first king Simukha around 230 BCE, in the north of <br />Tamizhagam with the lineage of Kanha (.207-189 BCE), Sri Satakarni I, <br />Satakarni II (c.166), Hala (c. 20-24 CE), Sri Yajna Satakarni (c.170-<br />199) and others. Before that, the Asokan empire was extending up to <br />Sravanabelagola covering the areas of the Cholas. He died in 232 BCE <br />and his successor Brihadratha was killed by Pushyamitra Sunga in 185 <br />BCE. The Sunga dynasty continued up to 73 BCE. Therefore, during the <br />reign of these kings of north, no Tamil king could have crossed over <br />to Ganges or Himalayas without encountering them. If the Tamil kings <br />would have actually defeated or conquered the kings of north, as <br />mentioned in the Tamil literature, definitely, there would be some <br />cross reference in their description. But, unfortunately no such <br />reference has been pointed out so far. Moreover, a careful study of <br />ancient Tamil literature clearly shows that the geography of <br />Tamizhagam is restricted between Vengadam in the north and Kumari in <br />the south. This has been repeatedly mentioned by the poets and the <br />later commentators. Therefore, if any Tamil king had conquered or <br />defeated any Aryan king or king or north, he might have defeated an <br />Andhra king of his time.</p>
<p>word `Ariyar' and its forms mentioned in the ancient Tamil <br />literature, it is evident that they would come under the following <br />categories:</p>
<p>`Ariyar' are ?<br />1. the people who were living immediately north of Tamizhagam or <br />Vengadam.<br />2. the kings who were ruling immediately north of Tamizhagam or <br />Vengadam.<br />3. the jugglers, tumblers, rope-dancers or acrobats of Tamizhagam.<br />4. the Rishis or saints of northern mountain of Tamizhagam or <br />Himalayas.<br />5. the elephant captors and / or trainers.<br />6. the groups or kings who waged wars against Tamil kings or <br />chiefs coming from north.<br />7. ]the honorific title `Ariya' was used to respect certain <br />professionals like wresrtlers, poets or king-cum-poets of Tamizhagam.</p>
<p>14. Were the `Ariyar' foreigners? A reference has already been made <br />about non-Tamil people coming from the north of Tamizhagam, who were <br />specifically mentioned as Kosar, Moriyar, Nandar, Tondaiyar and <br />Vadugar. There have been many specific references to Romans and <br />Greeks collectively called as `yavanar' by the Tamilians. Their <br />habits, dress, behaviour etc., are clearly described and explained to <br />show that they were foreigners. The word `milechar' is specifically <br />found in Mullaippattu; "Within the elegant well-lit inner apartment, <br />adorned with tiger-chains of skilled workmanship, well clad dumb <br />milechas (who make themselves understood by signs) attend the king, <br />who spends night absorbed in thought of (coming) battle. The mention <br />about the employment of milechas as bodyguards is very significant, <br />because unless the king had so much of confidence about his safety, <br />he would not have appointed the foreigners as his bodyguards. And if <br />the `Ariyar' mentioned were actually milechas or foreigners, they <br />would have been described and treated differently by the Tamil poets. <br />Though the poets repeatedly mention that the boundaries of this land <br />were Himalayas in the north, Kumari in the south, Kuna kadal (eastern <br />ocean), in the east and Kuda kadal (western ocean) in the west and <br />that `Ariyar' were the people or kings of the north of Tamizhagam, <br />nowhere they have been mentioned that they were foreigners and that <br />they came from outside the boundaries enumerated by them. Except in <br />the references about the encounters between them and Tamilian Kings <br />or chiefs, in all other places, they were treated as the people of <br />Tamizhagam. Even in the case of battles among the Tamil kings, <br />chieftains and particularly, Chera, Chola and Pandyas, elaborate <br />details have been given as to how they fought with each other, killed <br />others, destroyed the lands and towns, captured cattle, men and <br />women, collected their booty, seized the crowns and gold (which in <br />turn to be given to the pots) etc. But, surprisingly such details of <br />after-battle exploits and booties are not given in the case of defeat <br />of `Ariyar'. So it is not known why and how they were spared even <br />after their defeat. Many cases of Sati committed by the wives of <br />killed Tamililan kings and chieftains have been specifically <br />mentioned. Even Imayavaramban Nedunjeraladhan fought a war with the <br />contemporary Chola king, in which both the monarchs lost their lives <br />and their queens performed sati. But, surprisingly, there are no <br />mentions of killing of `Ariyar' kings and of performing of sati by <br />their queens. Therefore, really, it is very intriguing as to why and <br />how such benevolent and lenient treatment was given to the defeated, <br />conquered and captured `Ariyan' kings by the Tamil poets and kings. <br />In any case, it is evident that the `Ariyar' were not foreigners.</p>
<p>15. Conclusion: In the study of ancient Tamil literature, with a view <br />to find out the meaning and position of `Ariyar' as mentioned in <br />their context, it has been pointed out that `Ariyar' were the people <br />or kings of north of Tamizhagam and also of Tamizghagam considering <br />the various descriptions of them. Literary evidences of ancient <br />Tamizhagam with other epigraphic, numismatic and literary evidences <br />of contemporary kings of Maurya, Kalinga and Satavahana show that the <br />exploits of Tamil kings were perhaps restricted to the boundaries of <br />the ancient Tamizhagam and the defeat of `Ariya' or northern king or <br />kings refers to the defeat of Andhra king or kings. The word `Ariya' <br />was also used as an honorific title to certain professionals, besides <br />the generic usage to denote the people of the land with the <br />boundaries of Himalayas. As the names Kosar, Nandar, Moriar, <br />Tondaiyar and Vadugar have been used to indicate individual groups of <br />north, and the name `Ariya' is used to denote the people or kings who <br />were living or ruling immediately in the north of Tamizhagam, it is <br />very evident that no racial connotation was given to `ariyar' by the <br />ancient Tamils.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>There had been Pancha Dravidas. They not only include Tamil, Telugu, <br />Kannada, Malayalam and Tulu but also Maharashtra and Gujarat. There <br />were Pancha Gauda's. And this Pancha Gouda includes northern and <br />eastern India.</p>
<p>So are Brahmins in the mentioned linguals and states are Dravida's <br />and not Aryas?</p>
<p>If so even Gauda's are not Aryas.</p>

<p>  "Ariyar" in the Ancient Tamil Literature</p>
<p>  K. V. Ramakrishna Rao</p>
<p>  1. Introduction: Ever since the advent of "Ariyar" in Indian <br />history, <br />  the word "Aryan" has assumed significance and far-fetching <br />linguistic <br />  and racial connotations. Then came the advent of "Dravidians". <br />  Caldwell's linguistic invention was given a racial twist by the <br />  westerners and Indian scholars, though the concept of race and <br />  language are two separate entities. Leaving these hypotheses and <br />  theories aside, an attempt is made in this paper to study the <br />  word "Ariyar" fund in the ancient Tamil literature, popularly <br />known <br />  as Tamil Sangam literature. In the process of understanding the <br />past, <br />  there have been persistent and insistent attempts in <br />historiography <br />  to import later day ideas, concepts and theories to reflect back <br />on <br />  the past events leading to diversified and contradicting <br />situation.  <br />  But, here the approach has been restricted to get the meaning of <br />the <br />  word "Ariyar" as found in the ancient Tamil literature.</p>
<p>  2. In the ancient Tamil literature, the <br />  word "Ariyar", "Ariyan", "Ariya" etc., found in various places <br />withy <br />  their other forms and have been used both as nouns and adjectives. <br />As <br />  in recent times, diametrically opposite views have been expressed1 <br />  about the inclusion of the Tamil epics Cilappatikaram and <br />Manimekalai <br />  within the ambit of Sangam literature, the discussion is <br />restricted <br />  to Ettutogai (the eight anthologies), Pattupattu (the Ten poems) <br />and <br />  Padinen Kizh Kanakku (the Eighteen Minor works). Now, let us see, <br />  what these poems say about "Ariyar".</p>
<p>  3. Natrinai: It is the heading the list of Ettuttogai and its <br />general <br />  theme is love. The word "Ariyar" appears in the 170th poem, sung <br />by <br />  an unknown poet. The companion of the heroin of the poem warts <br />that <br />  the hero might be seduced by the beautiful lonely dancing girl. <br />She <br />  compares the victory of the Virali (the dancer), who came to a <br />  festival clad in a leaf-garment, over her group to the fact that <br />the <br />  famous town of Mullur, the "Ariya" soldiers swarmed, but ran away <br />  before the lance-battalion of Malayan (a Cheran), who unsheathed a <br />see <br />  that the people who came from the north to attack Cheras were <br />known <br />  as "Ariyar". </p>
<p>  4. Kuruntogai: Literally meaning `a collection of short poems', it <br />  comes next and its theme is also love. The word "Ariyar" appears <br />in <br />  the verse 7, line 3. Here, it is described how "Ariyars" dance on <br />a <br />  tied rope according to the beatings of a drum. "The forest full of <br />  bamboos were rattled the white ripe seeds of shivering vakai tree <br />  (Sirisa tree) tossed by the wind like the drumming of the "Ariyar" <br />  dancing on the rope". Therefore, here it is evident that "Ariyar" <br />  refers to a group of jugglers or tumblers, who performed <br />acrobatics.</p>
<p>  5. Paditruppattu (the Ten tens): It gives more information <br />  about `Ariyar' in historical setting. The entire extant collection <br />of <br />  poems with the deeds and exploits of the Chera Kings. The first <br />and <br />  tenth Tens are not available. In the Second Ten, the Patigam <br />  (Preface) describes how Imayavaramban Nedunjeraladhan engraved his <br />  royal sign `bow', which figures on his flag, on the top of the <br />  Himalayas (lines 4-7). Having roaring oceans has his boundaries <br />  (imizh kadal velittamizhagam), he ruled Tamizhagam (the Tamil <br />  country) in such a way o excel the other nadus (countries). He <br />  made `Ariyar' bow before him, who were having very great name <br />(fame <br />  and heritage).</p>
<p>  5.1. In the Second Ten, the 11th verse details as how the very <br />famous <br />  Himalayas abound with "Ariyas". Hence, scholars give two different <br />  meanings for the `Ariyar':</p>
<p>  `Ariyar" = Munivar (rishis) and <br />  "Ariyar' = `Ariya mannar' ( Aryan kings) .</p>
<p>  The hillside was resplendent with densely and well grown trees of <br />  erthrina indica (mullu murukka), a kind of citrus and the yak <br />  sleeping there would dream of waterfalls and sweet smelling grass. <br />  The Himalayas with such fertility was filled with many rishis. In <br />  between the Himalayas (in the north) and Kumari in the South, <br />there <br />  wee Kings who boasted their valour but they were conquered by <br />  Nedunjeraladhan. The meaning is thus rendered, "You quelled the <br />  valour of those who called themselves monarchs of the land between <br />  Camorin in the South and the famous Himalayas, where the Ariyas2 <br />  abound and yak sleeps on the hills covered thick with the Oleander <br />  and dreams of the broad mountain stream and the narandam (lemon-<br />  grass)"</p>
<p>  5.2. In fifth Ten, the patigam mentions `vadavar', i,e, the people <br />of <br />  north and `Ariya Annal' i.e, head of Ariya Kings. It describes how <br />  the kings of the north were afraid of Kadal Prakkottiya <br />Senguttuvan. <br />  He marched with his army to bring a good stone for chiseling an <br />image <br />  of the goddess of chastity. He came across a head or chief of <br />Ariya <br />  Kings, while passing through forests, and defeated him. Then, he <br />  brought a stone and washed it in waters of the Ganges. While <br />coming <br />  back, he stayed at Irumbil, destroyed Viyaur and Kodungur. He also <br />  killed a king named Pazhaiyon.</p>
<p>  5.3. In the same fifth Ten, the 43rd verse mentions the defeat of <br />  kings who were ruling between the Himalayas in the north and <br />Kumari <br />  in the south as boundaries. However, the names of the kings or the <br />  countries thus defeated are not given in the poem. In the padigam, <br />  the kings are mentioned as the `vadavar' (the Kings of north), the <br />  Chiefs of `Ariyar' are called `Ariya Annal', but here they are <br />  generally mentioned as `Ariya arasar', i.e, the Kings between the <br />  Himalayas and Kumari.</p>
<p>  5.4. In Seventh Ten, the 68th poem narrates how the people who <br />were <br />  living in the north or northern direction, were leading a fearless <br />  and happy life. The _expression used to denote them is `vadapula <br />  vazhnar'.</p>
<p>  5.5. So from the description of Paditruppattu, we can see <br />  that `Ariyar' are ?</p>
<p>  ? `the Kings of the north', <br />  ? `Rishis of the Himalayas', <br />  ? `the Kings between the boundaries of Himalayas and Kumari' and <br />  ? `the people of the north or northern direction of Tamilagam'.</p>
<p>  6. Agananuru (or Neduntogai): It also gives more details <br />  about `Ariyar'. `Ariyars' capture elephants by the use of trained <br />  female elephants. A public woman takes a vow that she would chain <br />her <br />  hero with her hair just as the `Ariyar' make the wild elephant <br />  domesticated with the she-elephant. Mullaippattu throws light on <br />  their employment by the kings of Tamilagam to train elephants.</p>
<p>  6.1. In another poem, a harlot wishes her bangles may be broken <br />just <br />  like the army of `Ariyars', which was defeated by the Kurumba <br />bowmen <br />  who fought under the Cholas, with their shower of arrows, <br />victorious <br />  spears and the black buckler. Here, also the names of the <br />  defeated `Ariyars' are not given, but it is mentioned that they <br />were <br />  defeated at Vallam (Tanjore).</p>
<p>  6.2. Paranar3 in his poem eulogises Senguttuvan that he attacked <br />the <br />  Aryar so as to make them scream, carved his emblem bow on the very <br />  famous mountain and chained the ferocious Kings. Here one can <br />notice <br />  that the name of the mountain is not specified and it is mentioned <br />in <br />  singular. As Himalayas are always mentioned in plural to denote a <br />  chain of mountains, a doubt arises as to whether the poet actually <br />  alludes to the Himalayas or to a certain `very famous, ancient and <br />  well grown' mountain situated north of Tamizhagam in those days.</p>
<p>  6.3. Agam.386 narrates how an Ariya wrestler was defeated by one <br />  Panan. The Ariya wrestler was known as `Ariya Porunan' and Panan <br />was <br />  another wrestler, whose state was in the north of Tamizgagam <br />  (Agam.325). Panan wrestled with Ariya Porunan and crushed his <br />  shoulders and arms, the sight of which made Kanaiyan, the <br />commander <br />  of Chera army, feel ashamed.</p>
<p>  6.5. So, according to Agananuru, `Ariyar' were ?</p>
<p>  ? the people who captured and trained elephants, <br />  ? who got defeated by the Cholas at Vallam, <br />  ? who were the Kings of the north, conquered and chained by <br />  Senguttuvan and <br />  ? who were in possession of a mountain where gold was available.</p>
<p>  As there was a wrestler known as `Ariya Porunan', the name should <br />  imply either that he was an Ariya or he came from the north. But, <br />it <br />  should be noted that Panan, who defeated Ariya Porunan and came <br />from <br />  a state situated north of Tamizhagam, was not given the prefix <br />  of `Ariya'. Therefore, it is evident that there were Ariya <br />wrestlers, <br />  just like Ariya jugglers, tumblers or rope dancers, elephant <br />trainers <br />  and trainers in Tamizhagam.</p>
<p>  7. Purananuru: In one poem4, Kovur Kizhar, a Tamil poet, describes <br />  how the kings of north were afraid of Cholan Naklankilli that they <br />  were spending their nights without sleep. Marudanila Naganar, <br />another <br />  poet5 describes how Pandiyan Kudakartattutunjiya Maran Vazhudi was <br />  having a chariot to wage a fierce war to kill the kings of north <br />  (vadapula mannar). Actually, the poet eulogises Maran Vazhudi who <br />is <br />  said to have caused `northern kings to fade'. But, particular <br />given <br />  about the names of such northern kings or countries and the place <br />or <br />  places where he defeated them in the battles are not at all given. <br />  There is a mention6 of a type of a sandal paste of `northern <br />  mountain' (vadakundrattuchandanam), Agananuru also refers to <br />this7. <br />  But here also, the name of the northern mountain is not mentioned. <br />  Thre important point to be noted is, though the <br />  expressions `vadapulattarasar', `vadapulamannar' and `vadakundram' <br />  are used to denote the kings of the north and northern mountain, <br />the <br />  prefix `Ariyar' is conspicuously missing. Therefore, it is very <br />  evident that there were northern kings and northern mountains <br />other <br />  than Ariya kings of north and northern mountain of `Ariyar'.</p>
<p>  8. Non-Tamilian people of North: In the case of non-Tamilian <br />people, <br />  specific names have been mentioned like Kosar8, Moriyar9, <br />Nandar10, <br />  Tondaiyar11, and Vadugar12. Kosars belonged to Tulu country and <br />they <br />  were living south of the Vindhya and near the shores of western <br />  ocean. Nandar and Moriyar are no others but the Nandas and Mauryas <br />of <br />  north India. Tondaiyars were found in the forests of Vengadam <br />hills <br />  where elephants were abundant. So they went on expeditions, <br />captured, <br />  trained and formed them into a brigade. The trained elephants <br />brought <br />  firewood to the Rishis and they ate the food of their country <br />only. </p></blockquote>
<p>vocation </p>
<blockquote><p>  like Ariyars, as far as elephants are concerned. Vadugar were <br />having <br />  their lands beyond Vengadam and they spoke a different language. <br />  Another point to be noted is that at one place (Puram. 378), the <br />  Vadugars are denoted as `vada vadugar'. The term `vadugar' <br />connotes <br />  that they were from the north and hence the _expression `vada <br />  vadugar' is very significant, as it actually denotes `northern <br />group <br />  of northerners'. This can be compared with the _expression `vada <br />  Ariyar' and vadavariyar" denoting `northern Ariyar', but such <br />  expressions are found in Silappathikaram and not in the Sangam <br />  literature taken for discussion. But the important point to be <br />noted <br />  is the usage of `Ariyar', while the word `Ariyar' is generally <br />used <br />  to denote the people of north or the kings of north, the above <br />  mentioned words Kosar, Nandar, Moriyar, Tondaiyar and Vadugar are <br />  used to denote only particular groups of people who lived in the <br />  north of Tamizhagam.</p>
<p>  9. Arya and Ariya suffixes and prefixs: Epigraphic, numismatic and <br />  literary evidences are abundant to show that the Sathavahanas were <br />  ruling in the north of Tamizhagam with their intruding territories <br />  extended up to Caddalore. The important point which should be <br />  mentioned here is that the `Arya' endings in the names of the <br />donees <br />  are found only in the grants coming from the territory immediately <br />  south of river Krishna (The Kondamudi, the Mayadavolu, the Hira <br />  Hadagalli, the Kanteru Nandivarman I and the Mattapad grants). <br />`Arya' <br />  (venerable) as honorific prefix to the names of Buddhist and Jain <br />  teachers and saints occurs in inscriptions all over India. Indeed <br />the <br />  Tamil epic Manumekhalai mentions Buddha as `Ariyan' (25-6). `Arya' <br />as <br />  an honorific title is found in the Hathigumpa inscription of <br />  Kharavela13. `Arya' as initial part of personal names occur in <br />Junnar <br />  inscription inscription14 (Ayama), and in the Nagarjunakonda <br />  inscription15 (Ayakotosiri) and Ayasiri, names of royal <br />  ladies. `Aryadeva' is the name of the celebrated disciple16 of <br />  Nagarjuna (3rd cent. CE), who spent a greater part of his life in <br />  Andhradesha. But the earliest inscription to exhibit names with <br />Arya-<br />  ending is the Kondamudi grant of Jayavarman (3rd cent.CE), where <br />all <br />  doinees have names ending with `aja', as also found in the same <br />  manner in the Mayadavola and Mattapad grants.</p>
<p>  9.1. `Aja' is another form of Prakrit `Arya', Sanskrit `Arya' and <br />  Tamil `Ayya', `Iyya', `Iyer' and `Ariyar'. `Ariyar' or `Ariya' <br />  started as an honorific prefix anmd become a name-ending much the <br />  same way as `sri' found in many inscriptions. And we can find the <br />  same trend in Tamil literature, as in `Ariya Annal' (Head or <br />chiuef <br />  of Ariya Kings), `Ariya Porunan' (Arya wrestler), `Ariya Arasan <br />  Bragadattan'17 (Ariya king named Bragadattan) and `Ariya Arasan <br />Yazh <br />  Brahmadattan'18 (Ariya king poet Brahmadattan). The word `Ayyar' <br />  or `Iyer' is found in many places in ancient Tamil literature <br />  including Tolkappiyam19, which is considered as the oldest extant <br />  Tamil work. It is used to represent a teacher, brother, priest, <br />  saint, andanan (Brahmana), superior, master or king, with <br />veneration.</p>
<p>  10. `Ariake': A reference to Periplus' `Ariaca' and <br />  Ptolemy's `Ariake' has to be made, as it has direct bearing on the <br />  discussion of `Ariyar' of the ancient Tamil literature. About the <br />  name `Ariaca' of the Periplus, W. H. Scoff opines: "the word in <br />the <br />  text is very uncertain". Lassen thinks that the name <br />  Sanskrit `Latica' (pronounced Larica) and included the land on <br />both <br />  sides of the gulf of Cambay20. Ptolemy (c.140 CE) calls the first <br />  province of Tamil country going down from the north as `Lymyrice <br />or <br />  Dymirike'. He and the author of Periplus use it only as the name <br />of <br />  the Chera territory. The country north of it was to them `Ariake', <br />  belongoing to the Aryas, in the restricted sense of Marathas. <br />Taking <br />  the other forms `Ariake Sadinon' and `Ariake of the Pirates', they <br />  could easily have made out that `Ariake' referred to the country <br />  later known as the Maharastra, then ruled over by the Satavahana <br />  kings of the Andhra dynasty21. Therefore, it is evident that <br />Ariake <br />  or Aricca denotes `Akam' or the country of Ariyar who were ruling <br />or <br />  living immediately north of Dymirike or Tamizagam.</p>
<p>  11. Himalayas of Ariyar: We have seen how some Tamil kings marched <br />  towards the Himalayas to bring stones or to defeat the kings in <br />  between the `Himalayas' and `Kumari', and inscribed their royal <br />  emblems on it. Already it has been pointed out that the poets <br />  expressions like `very famous, ancient and well grown' mountain <br />  (Agam.396), `tall mountain with gold' (Agam.398), `a big stone' <br />  (Puram.171) and a `tall mountain' (Puram.61), even without naming <br />the <br />  mountain, it is evident that the poets coisidered `Imaiyam' <br />  or `Imayam' was a single mountain situated north of <br />  Tamizhagam. `Imam' means snow, that is why, the Himalayas are <br />called <br />  so. But, in the Tamil literature, wherever the name `Imayam' is <br />not <br />  mentioned, it is also not mentioned that the `tall, ancient, very <br />  famous and stony' mountain with gold is covered with snow. <br />Everybody <br />  knows that Himalayas are indeed very famous, ancient and `several <br />  series of more or less parallel or converging ranges'. Also the <br />poets <br />  have not given the details how the kings climbed up the <br />`Himalayas', <br />  cut the required stone, brought it down, etc., except that `he <br />washed <br />  it in the waters of Ganges'. Therefore, it is evident that <br />whenever <br />  the name `Imayam' is not mentioned, we have to take it as a <br />mountain <br />  that was situated in the north of Tamizhagam.</p>
<p>  12. Non-Tamil kings of north: The Hathigumpha inscription of <br />  Kharavela, a king of Kalinga and a contemporary of the third or <br />fifth <br />  king of the Satavahana line, is the only epigraphic reference to <br />the <br />  kingdoms of the Tamil country after the Asoka inscription. <br />Kharavela <br />  ruled Kalinga in the first half of the second century BCE and in <br />the <br />  eleventh year of hid reign (c.155 BCE), he is said to have <br />destroyed <br />  a confederacy of Tamil states ? Tramiradesa sanghatanam [(T(r)<br />mira, <br />  Damira or Tamila] ? which was 113 years old (113+17) at the time <br />and <br />  had been a source of danger22. The Satavahanas were ruling, <br />starting <br />  with the first king Simukha around 230 BCE, in the north of <br />  Tamizhagam with the lineage of Kanha (.207-189 BCE), Sri Satakarni <br />I, <br />  Satakarni II (c.166), Hala (c. 20-24 CE), Sri Yajna Satakarni <br />(c.170-<br />  199) and others. Before that, the Asokan empire was extending up <br />to <br />  Sravanabelagola covering the areas of the Cholas. He died in 232 <br />BCE <br />  and his successor Brihadratha was killed by Pushyamitra Sunga in <br />185 <br />  BCE. The Sunga dynasty continued up to 73 BCE. Therefore, during <br />the <br />  reign of these kings of north, no Tamil king could have crossed <br />over <br />  to Ganges or Himalayas without encountering them. If the Tamil <br />kings <br />  would have actually defeated or conquered the kings of north, as <br />  mentioned in the Tamil literature, definitely, there would be some <br />  cross reference in their description. But, unfortunately no such <br />  reference has been pointed out so far. Moreover, a careful study <br />of <br />  ancient Tamil literature clearly shows that the geography of <br />  Tamizhagam is restricted between Vengadam in the north and Kumari <br />in <br />  the south. This has been repeatedly mentioned by the poets and the <br />  later commentators. Therefore, if any Tamil king had conquered or <br />  defeated any Aryan king or king or north, he might have defeated <br />an <br />  Andhra king of his time.</p>
<p>the <br />  word `Ariyar' and its forms mentioned in the ancient Tamil <br />  literature, it is evident that they would come under the following <br />  categories:</p>
<p>  `Ariyar' are ?<br />  1. the people who were living immediately north of Tamizhagam <br />or <br />  Vengadam.<br />  2. the kings who were ruling immediately north of Tamizhagam or <br />  Vengadam.<br />  3. the jugglers, tumblers, rope-dancers or acrobats of <br />Tamizhagam.<br />  4. the Rishis or saints of northern mountain of Tamizhagam or <br />  Himalayas.<br />  5. the elephant captors and / or trainers.<br />  6. the groups or kings who waged wars against Tamil kings or <br />  chiefs coming from north.<br />  7. ]the honorific title `Ariya' was used to respect certain <br />  professionals like wresrtlers, poets or king-cum-poets of <br />Tamizhagam.</p>
<p>  14. Were the `Ariyar' foreigners? A reference has already been <br />made <br />  about non-Tamil people coming from the north of Tamizhagam, who <br />were <br />  specifically mentioned as Kosar, Moriyar, Nandar, Tondaiyar and <br />  Vadugar. There have been many specific references to Romans and <br />  Greeks collectively called as `yavanar' by the Tamilians. Their <br />  habits, dress, behaviour etc., are clearly described and explained <br />to <br />  show that they were foreigners. The word `milechar' is <br />specifically <br />  found in Mullaippattu; "Within the elegant well-lit inner <br />apartment, <br />  adorned with tiger-chains of skilled workmanship, well clad dumb <br />  milechas (who make themselves understood by signs) attend the <br />king, <br />  who spends night absorbed in thought of (coming) battle. The <br />mention <br />  about the employment of milechas as bodyguards is very <br />significant, <br />  because unless the king had so much of confidence about his <br />safety, <br />  he would not have appointed the foreigners as his bodyguards. And <br />if <br />  the `Ariyar' mentioned were actually milechas or foreigners, they <br />  would have been described and treated differently by the Tamil <br />poets. <br />  Though the poets repeatedly mention that the boundaries of this <br />land <br />  were Himalayas in the north, Kumari in the south, Kuna kadal <br />(eastern <br />  ocean), in the east and Kuda kadal (western ocean) in the west and <br />  that `Ariyar' were the people or kings of the north of Tamizhagam, <br />  nowhere they have been mentioned that they were foreigners and <br />that <br />  they came from outside the boundaries enumerated by them. Except <br />in <br />  the references about the encounters between them and Tamilian <br />Kings <br />  or chiefs, in all other places, they were treated as the people of <br />  Tamizhagam. Even in the case of battles among the Tamil kings, <br />  chieftains and particularly, Chera, Chola and Pandyas, elaborate <br />  details have been given as to how they fought with each other, <br />killed <br />  others, destroyed the lands and towns, captured cattle, men and <br />  women, collected their booty, seized the crowns and gold (which in <br />  turn to be given to the pots) etc. But, surprisingly such details <br />of <br />  after-battle exploits and booties are not given in the case of <br />defeat <br />  of `Ariyar'. So it is not known why and how they were spared even <br />  after their defeat. Many cases of Sati committed by the wives of <br />  killed Tamililan kings and chieftains have been specifically <br />  mentioned. Even Imayavaramban Nedunjeraladhan fought a war with <br />the <br />  contemporary Chola king, in which both the monarchs lost their <br />lives <br />  and their queens performed sati. But, surprisingly, there are no <br />  mentions of killing of `Ariyar' kings and of performing of sati by <br />  their queens. Therefore, really, it is very intriguing as to why <br />and <br />  how such benevolent and lenient treatment was given to the <br />defeated, <br />  conquered and captured `Ariyan' kings by the Tamil poets and <br />kings. <br />  In any case, it is evident that the `Ariyar' were not foreigners.</p>
<p>  15. Conclusion: In the study of ancient Tamil literature, with a <br />view <br />  to find out the meaning and position of `Ariyar' as mentioned in <br />  their context, it has been pointed out that `Ariyar' were the <br />people <br />  or kings of north of Tamizhagam and also of Tamizghagam <br />considering <br />  the various descriptions of them. Literary evidences of ancient <br />  Tamizhagam with other epigraphic, numismatic and literary <br />evidences <br />  of contemporary kings of Maurya, Kalinga and Satavahana show that <br />the <br />  exploits of Tamil kings were perhaps restricted to the boundaries <br />of <br />  the ancient Tamizhagam and the defeat of `Ariya' or northern king <br />or <br />  kings refers to the defeat of Andhra king or kings. The word <br />`Ariya' <br />  was also used as an honorific title to certain professionals, <br />besides <br />  the generic usage to denote the people of the land with the <br />  boundaries of Himalayas. As the names Kosar, Nandar, Moriar, <br />  Tondaiyar and Vadugar have been used to indicate individual groups <br />of <br />  north, and the name `Ariya' is used to denote the people or kings <br />who <br />  were living or ruling immediately in the north of Tamizhagam, it <br />is <br />  very evident that no racial connotation was given to `ariyar' by <br />the <br />  ancient Tamils.</p>

<p>    Myself and one of my friendwere having a discussion on this. </p>
<p>    He started mentioning a new theory.</p>
<p>    Dravidans were native of Lemuria and Aryans were native of the <br />  present <br />    Asia land mass.Due to movement of landmasses, Lemuria crossed <br />with <br />    current Asia on its way of movement. This resulted in Himalayas <br />    geographically. And the clash between Aryans and Dravidans, like <br />    pallavas between Chera, Chola, Chalukya and Pandyas.</p>
<p>    This may not have proves. </p>
<p>    Any discussion on this.</p>
