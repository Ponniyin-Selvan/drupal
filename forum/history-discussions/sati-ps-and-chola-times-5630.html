</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi all, am interesting in knowing how prevelant what the practice of <br />Sati/Udan kattai Erudhal during the chola times, both historically and <br />in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ?</p>
<p>As far as my memory goes Kalki mentions Sati on two occasions highly. <br />One when Kundavai is talking of her love to <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  and exalts chola women <br />who do not hesitate to burn themselves on the pyre with their spouses. <br />Second is when Sundara chola passed away and Vanavan Madevi commits <br />Sati. Personally I am not impressed at all, but given these were times <br />when war/murder all were widely prevalant, am not surprised. Kalki can <br />be both very progressive (Savitri of Thyaga Bhoomi asks the husband <br />who abandoned her to get out) and very conservative at the same time <br />as far as women's characters go.</acronym></p>
<p>I guess he had to live up to his audience and not be too radical, but <br />he did take opportunites to show women as confident, successful and <br />independant.</p></acronym></p>

        <p>I would not mind contributing to anybody's thesis on<br />kalki's female characters. For someone of his<br />generation the women characters were very creative and<br />very progressive. Let us start perhaps one per week,<br />like we do temples. I will write on Sivakaami, one of<br />my favorites, tonight.</p>

        <p>Kathie, really nice to hear that!! I have often<br />wondered at the fascination non indians have for his<br />writing, i can understand English people perhaps since<br />British culture is so part of what he wrote too, but<br />american is so different!! It indeed speaks highly of<br />the simplicity and universal appeal of his writing. </p>
<p>And what better treat than to visit India after<br />reading his work! There are only two perspectives a<br />foreigner 'gets' India, particularly a westerner, from<br />what I have seen - one is the spiritual seeking<br />perspective, and second, simply put is RK Narayan's<br />perspective!!</p>

<blockquote><p>  - there are still some<br />    stories, such as `Horse and two goats' that one feels could have <br />  only<br />    happened in a Tamil village. </p>
<p>  not so suneeta. i was in bangalore yesterday and right in the middle <br />  of some main road was an ayyanar temple with terracotta horses.<br />  so that story could have happened there too.</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>I always thought Ayyanar was a Tamil temple deity....I just googled<br />Ayyanar and found that due to cultural mingling, even Sinhalese<br />Buddhists have an equivalent!<br />Btw, another RKN story on a distinctly Tamil character is `Annamalai'.</p>

        <p>Yes the guide is a great story, I will maintain that<br />Narayan was definitely a better story writer than<br />Kalki for his simplicity in plot and total lack of<br />cliches or coincidental situations. Kalki has a<br />tendency to go over board with coincidences sometimes,<br />in Thyaga Bhoomi for example the father does not<br />recognize the daughter, a very unreal situation. Alai<br />Osai is full of people finding one another on streets<br />in big cities, hiding here and there and lot of stuff<br />that is very unbelievable. But I don't believe Narayan<br />had any patience for the complexity and historical<br />relevance of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and other novels Kalki wrote.</p>
<p>Narayan's malgudi and other stories have a mix of<br />tamil and kannada culture, same as he was.<br />Swaminathan, Rajam etc are not kannada names. The<br />village can be karnataka or tamil naadu or any part of<br />india with some minor variances. Narayan was never<br />given to debates on regional identity and language but<br />if prompted he would gently assert that he was a<br />'mysorean', which was the word for kannadiga in those<br />days.</p>

<p>  not so suneeta. i was in bangalore yesterday and<br />  right in the middle <br />  of some main road was an ayyanar temple with<br />  terracotta horses.<br />  so that story could have happened there too.</p>

        <p>No april fooling, that is a true story and still<br />talked about in family circles. This time while I was<br />in India we did some attic cleaning and one of our<br />findings was the marriage album of Kamala's first<br />marriage to our relative, it literally is a who is who<br />of tamil celebrity world - Rajaji, Kalki, <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  Vasan, MS<br />Subbulakshmi, the RK brothers, all 7 of them, SV<br />Venkataraman (comedian SV Sekar's father who was<br />Kalki's friend and gave music for Meera and Savitri),<br />AV Meiyappa Chettiar etc etc. My grandmother<br />absolutely forbid anyone from scanning or even<br />borrowing those pictures given the story behind it.</acronym></p>
<p>Kamala and Laxman despite all that happened have been<br />happily married years now - his first wife still holds<br />his last name with a vengence. Just so that you know<br />the difference, the Kamala on this link is the dancer<br />and his first wife.<br /><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/fr/2006/07/14/stories/2006071401230300.htm" title="http://www.thehindu.com/fr/2006/07/14/stories/2006071401230300.htm">http://www.thehindu.com/fr/2006/07/14/stories/2006071401230300.htm</a></p>
<p>The Kamala who writes children's stories (Thama's<br />stories something) and speaks in Bombay ladies clubs<br />to this day is the real wife.</p>

<p>    Venkatesh, very distant relative only, nothing<br />  close.<br />    Laxman and RKN were very opposite in temperment,<br />  RKN<br />    was very much Gandhian like, simple habits always<br />    walked when he could, rarely if not never attended<br />    parties or high society gatherings and always,<br />  always<br />    courteous to anyone. He had an absolutely amazing<br />    memory for people and places, even if he saw you<br />  once<br />    it is very likely he would remember you by name<br />  and<br />    any details. Laxman on the other hand was a high<br />    society bombayite even early on and as i know<br />    arrogant, snobbish (I have never met him).</p>
<p>    The Kamala story is one for a novel, since most<br />  people<br />    connected are dead and gone I can talk of it i<br />    suppose, would not otherwise. Laxman was married<br />    initially to Kumaari Kamala, the classical dancer<br />  who<br />    appears in several b/w movies - konjum salangai,<br />    baktha raavana etc. The other Kamala was indeed<br />  his<br />    niece, rich, spoilt and very good looking. She was<br />    initially married to my father's distant relative,<br />    both extremely rich families. It is said Rajaji<br />  was<br />    among the celebrities who attended that wedding<br />  and<br />    seeing the amount of money thrown around, he set<br />  the<br />    income tax authorities on Kamala's father :))</p>
<p>    Anyway it seemed Kamala had interests in her uncle<br />  RKL<br />    even before the wedding and the dalliance<br />  continued<br />    after. Her husband used to travel abroad<br />  frequently<br />    and in his absence they were a merry pair and the<br />    bombay high society was abuzz with rumors. She got<br />    pregnant and had a boy, and the boy was a strong<br />  look<br />    alike of Laxman. So things came to a pass and her<br />    husband had had enough, there was no divorce in<br />  those<br />    days for hindu marriages so he converted himself<br />  to a<br />    muslim 'talaqued' her and moved to US. Kumaari<br />  Kamala<br />    separated herself from Laxman till divorce was<br />  legal<br />    and then divorced him. The 'merry pair' married<br />  and<br />    lived happily ever after :))</p>
<p>    Such is the story of high society marriages many<br />  times<br />    but this one makes for interesting reading :))</p>

<p>        Venkatesh, I stand corrected on Tyaga Bhoomi<br />        timelines, thank you and also for the most<br />      interesting<br />        post on RKN and Kalki.</p>
<p>        RKN was distantly related to my Dad, so have<br />  seen<br />      him<br />        couple of times and know the family. I had no<br />  idea<br />        Kalki wrote foreword for his stories, that was<br />      really<br />        very interesting. RKN, by the way was not pure<br />      bred<br />        tamilian, he was part kannadiga, his father<br />  was<br />      raised<br />        in Karnataka and he moved there to Mysore too<br />  very<br />        early on and retained sentiments and love for<br />        Karnataka a lot more than Chennai/TN. He knew<br />  to<br />      read<br />        and write Tamil and in his later years<br />      particularly<br />        read all of Kamba Ramayana and wrote the<br />  English<br />        Ramayana based on that. His spoken tamil was<br />  what<br />      they<br />        call 'kamil', kannada mixed tamil.</p>
<p>        If he ever considered writing in an indian<br />      language he<br />        would probably have preferred Kannada. </p>
<p>        By the way, would you mind sending details of<br />  the<br />      book<br />        you got this from and where I can get it.</p>

<p>          his english artices and stories was<br />  published in<br />      THE<br />          MERRY MAGAZINE <br />          of the same group</p>
<p>          kalki has written the foreword for the<br />      translation<br />          of narayans book<br />          swami and friends which was serialised in<br />          anandavikadan in 1939 and <br />          later published. r.k was paid the princely<br />  sum<br />      of<br />          500 rupes for his <br />          efforts.</p>

        <p>Yes<br />perhaps narayan was one writer i enjoy a wee bit more than kalki</p>
<p>and the only novel i ever cried for was "The guide"- but that was <br />long long ago<br />that novel still gets a lump in my throat when I read it.<br />recently when i read veenai bavani by kalki I was indeed reminded of <br />rosie.</p>
<p>- there are still some</p>

<p>not so suneeta. i was in bangalore yesterday and right in the middle <br />of some main road was an ayyanar temple with terracotta horses.<br />so that story could have happened there too.</p>

        <p>Venkatesh, yes, I also understood your mail as saying Kalki had the<br />book translated for Ananda vikatan (by someone). Incidentally, you may<br />have read `Gods, demons and others' - by RKN - a nice translation of<br />Indian mythological stories. So one can imagine a wry translation of<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  by him....<br />Reg. previous posts about RKN's Kannada roots - there are still some<br />stories, such as `Horse and two goats' that one feels could have only<br />happened in a Tamil village. One wonders reading those stories (like<br />Kalki) why he didn't write in Tamil. But RKN has a huge fan following<br />all over the world - I have a Canadian colleague (not of Indian<br />origin!) who always carries a copy of Swami and friends in her<br />handbag.. She says she feels Malgudi is like a second home....So maybe<br />it is good RKN wrote in English after all! In fact, <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is also getting<br />popular among non-Tamil Indians after the translation.</acronym></acronym></p>

<p>        Reading Kalki's Thyaga Bhoomi reminded me of R.K.Narayan's Dark <br />  Room<br />        which was written in 1930s. Wonder when Thyaga Bhoomi was <br />  written.<br />        The heroine in Narayan's novel is a simple submissive housewife <br />      (also<br />        called Savitri!) whose husband is cruel to her and neglects her <br />  for <br />      a<br />        new lady in his office. Many insults later, she leaves home and<br />        survives for a few days by eating rice prasadam at a koil. She <br />  comes<br />        back because she realises that she can't do this forever and <br />  for her<br />        children, but her one act of defiance has changed things at <br />  their<br />        home. It is a very nice novel, but of course Thyaga Bhoomi has <br />  a <br />      more<br />        positive ending. </p>

<p>          Perhaps the most progressive of Kalki's women was<br />          Savitri of Tyaga Bhoomi, in my humble opinion. Savitri<br />          is cast out by her husband and his family when she is<br />          pregnant, without any money or anyone to go to. On her<br />          own she finds a distant relative, becomes a graduate<br />          and a very rich woman in middle age.</p>
<p>          When she is well known her husband Sridhar comes back<br />          looking for her and seeks reunion. Savitri asks the<br />          'dharwan' or watchman to remove him from the house.<br />          She later joins the freedom struggle.</p>
<p>          My grandmother used to say what a huge controversy the<br />          story ending created, women casting out husbands or<br />          even speaking up for themselves was unknown in those<br />          days and Kalki was brave to make his heroine that way.</p>

<p>              This story, I think was written in<br />            pre-independence era. Even if <br />            its<br />              Kalki's imagination, writers always take<br />            inspiration from the<br />              prevailing society. </p>
<p>              I have not seen the movie 'water'.

<p>              A person with a clear mind will enjoy a 70mm movie<br />            on the big <br />            screen,<br />              and people who want to find fault will definitely<br />            discover a small<br />              black dot at the corner of the 70mm screen.</p>
<p>              There are humpteen good things in our society and<br />            no one talks <br />            about<br />              it.

<blockquote><p>  Venkatesh, very distant relative only, nothing close.<br />  Laxman and RKN were very opposite in temperment, RKN<br />  was very much Gandhian like, simple habits always<br />  walked when he could, rarely if not never attended<br />  parties or high society gatherings and always, always<br />  courteous to anyone. He had an absolutely amazing<br />  memory for people and places, even if he saw you once<br />  it is very likely he would remember you by name and<br />  any details. Laxman on the other hand was a high<br />  society bombayite even early on and as i know<br />  arrogant, snobbish (I have never met him).</p>
<p>  The Kamala story is one for a novel, since most people<br />  connected are dead and gone I can talk of it i<br />  suppose, would not otherwise. Laxman was married<br />  initially to Kumaari Kamala, the classical dancer who<br />  appears in several b/w movies - konjum salangai,<br />  baktha raavana etc. The other Kamala was indeed his<br />  niece, rich, spoilt and very good looking. She was<br />  initially married to my father's distant relative,<br />  both extremely rich families. It is said Rajaji was<br />  among the celebrities who attended that wedding and<br />  seeing the amount of money thrown around, he set the<br />  income tax authorities on Kamala's father :))</p>
<p>  Anyway it seemed Kamala had interests in her uncle RKL<br />  even before the wedding and the dalliance continued<br />  after. Her husband used to travel abroad frequently<br />  and in his absence they were a merry pair and the<br />  bombay high society was abuzz with rumors. She got<br />  pregnant and had a boy, and the boy was a strong look<br />  alike of Laxman. So things came to a pass and her<br />  husband had had enough, there was no divorce in those<br />  days for hindu marriages so he converted himself to a<br />  muslim 'talaqued' her and moved to US. Kumaari Kamala<br />  separated herself from Laxman till divorce was legal<br />  and then divorced him. The 'merry pair' married and<br />  lived happily ever after :))</p>
<p>  Such is the story of high society marriages many times<br />  but this one makes for interesting reading :))</p>

<p>      Venkatesh, I stand corrected on Tyaga Bhoomi<br />      timelines, thank you and also for the most<br />    interesting<br />      post on RKN and Kalki.</p>
<p>      RKN was distantly related to my Dad, so have seen<br />    him<br />      couple of times and know the family. I had no idea<br />      Kalki wrote foreword for his stories, that was<br />    really<br />      very interesting. RKN, by the way was not pure<br />    bred<br />      tamilian, he was part kannadiga, his father was<br />    raised<br />      in Karnataka and he moved there to Mysore too very<br />      early on and retained sentiments and love for<br />      Karnataka a lot more than Chennai/TN. He knew to<br />    read<br />      and write Tamil and in his later years<br />    particularly<br />      read all of Kamba Ramayana and wrote the English<br />      Ramayana based on that. His spoken tamil was what<br />    they<br />      call 'kamil', kannada mixed tamil.</p>
<p>      If he ever considered writing in an indian<br />    language he<br />      would probably have preferred Kannada. </p>
<p>      By the way, would you mind sending details of the<br />    book<br />      you got this from and where I can get it.</p>

<p>Venkatesh, very distant relative only, nothing close.<br />Laxman and RKN were very opposite in temperment, RKN<br />was very much Gandhian like, simple habits always<br />walked when he could, rarely if not never attended<br />parties or high society gatherings and always, always<br />courteous to anyone. He had an absolutely amazing<br />memory for people and places, even if he saw you once<br />it is very likely he would remember you by name and<br />any details. Laxman on the other hand was a high<br />society bombayite even early on and as i know<br />arrogant, snobbish (I have never met him).</p>
<p>The Kamala story is one for a novel, since most people<br />connected are dead and gone I can talk of it i<br />suppose, would not otherwise. Laxman was married<br />initially to Kumaari Kamala, the classical dancer who<br />appears in several b/w movies - konjum salangai,<br />baktha raavana etc. The other Kamala was indeed his<br />niece, rich, spoilt and very good looking. She was<br />initially married to my father's distant relative,<br />both extremely rich families. It is said Rajaji was<br />among the celebrities who attended that wedding and<br />seeing the amount of money thrown around, he set the<br />income tax authorities on Kamala's father :))</p>
<p>Anyway it seemed Kamala had interests in her uncle RKL<br />even before the wedding and the dalliance continued<br />after. Her husband used to travel abroad frequently<br />and in his absence they were a merry pair and the<br />bombay high society was abuzz with rumors. She got<br />pregnant and had a boy, and the boy was a strong look<br />alike of Laxman. So things came to a pass and her<br />husband had had enough, there was no divorce in those<br />days for hindu marriages so he converted himself to a<br />muslim 'talaqued' her and moved to US. Kumaari Kamala<br />separated herself from Laxman till divorce was legal<br />and then divorced him. The 'merry pair' married and<br />lived happily ever after :))</p>
<p>Such is the story of high society marriages many times<br />but this one makes for interesting reading :))</p>

<p>    Venkatesh, I stand corrected on Tyaga Bhoomi<br />    timelines, thank you and also for the most<br />  interesting<br />    post on RKN and Kalki.</p>
<p>    RKN was distantly related to my Dad, so have seen<br />  him<br />    couple of times and know the family. I had no idea<br />    Kalki wrote foreword for his stories, that was<br />  really<br />    very interesting. RKN, by the way was not pure<br />  bred<br />    tamilian, he was part kannadiga, his father was<br />  raised<br />    in Karnataka and he moved there to Mysore too very<br />    early on and retained sentiments and love for<br />    Karnataka a lot more than Chennai/TN. He knew to<br />  read<br />    and write Tamil and in his later years<br />  particularly<br />    read all of Kamba Ramayana and wrote the English<br />    Ramayana based on that. His spoken tamil was what<br />  they<br />    call 'kamil', kannada mixed tamil.</p>
<p>    If he ever considered writing in an indian<br />  language he<br />    would probably have preferred Kannada. </p>
<p>    By the way, would you mind sending details of the<br />  book<br />    you got this from and where I can get it.</p>

<p>      Reading Kalki's Thyaga Bhoomi reminded me of R.K.Narayan's Dark <br />Room<br />      which was written in 1930s. Wonder when Thyaga Bhoomi was <br />written.<br />      The heroine in Narayan's novel is a simple submissive housewife <br />    (also<br />      called Savitri!) whose husband is cruel to her and neglects her <br />for <br />    a<br />      new lady in his office. Many insults later, she leaves home and<br />      survives for a few days by eating rice prasadam at a koil. She <br />comes<br />      back because she realises that she can't do this forever and <br />for her<br />      children, but her one act of defiance has changed things at <br />their<br />      home. It is a very nice novel, but of course Thyaga Bhoomi has <br />a <br />    more<br />      positive ending. </p>

<p>        Perhaps the most progressive of Kalki's women was<br />        Savitri of Tyaga Bhoomi, in my humble opinion. Savitri<br />        is cast out by her husband and his family when she is<br />        pregnant, without any money or anyone to go to. On her<br />        own she finds a distant relative, becomes a graduate<br />        and a very rich woman in middle age.</p>
<p>        When she is well known her husband Sridhar comes back<br />        looking for her and seeks reunion. Savitri asks the<br />        'dharwan' or watchman to remove him from the house.<br />        She later joins the freedom struggle.</p>
<p>        My grandmother used to say what a huge controversy the<br />        story ending created, women casting out husbands or<br />        even speaking up for themselves was unknown in those<br />        days and Kalki was brave to make his heroine that way.</p>

<p>          this was another common thread in many of kalki's<br />          books</p>
<p>          a young woman marrying an elder man. starting from<br />          sembiyan madevi <br />          who recalls her story, nandini, kalyani......</p>

<p>          But she inherits all the property <br />          and<br />            manages them efficiently. one of her husbands<br />          distant relative, who<br />            wants to acquire all her wealth fails time and<br />          again, because she <br />          was<br />            so powerful.</p>
<p>            This story, I think was written in<br />          pre-independence era. Even if <br />          its<br />            Kalki's imagination, writers always take<br />          inspiration from the<br />            prevailing society. </p>
<p>            I have not seen the movie 'water'. But I feel, all<br />          those people who<br />            criticize, not just the state of women (widow),<br />          but anything in <br />          indian<br />            culture, especially hindu's practice, try to find<br />          a dot in a huge<br />            madil suvar and blow it out of proportion.</p>
<p>            A person with a clear mind will enjoy a 70mm movie<br />          on the big <br />          screen,<br />            and people who want to find fault will definitely<br />          discover a small<br />            black dot at the corner of the 70mm screen.</p>
<p>            There are humpteen good things in our society and<br />          no one talks <br />          about<br />            it. But one or two misdeeds here and there......we<br />          get lots of <br />          social<br />            workers to raise there voice against it.</p>

<p>Delhi, 1996, by Susan Ram and N. Ram</p>
<p>thats the book. published by penguin</p>
<p>did you know that when hindu ram realised r.K.N's maternal grandpas <br />house in vellaarlar street where he grew up was being demolished he <br />bought the main door as a memento.<br />i used to think, the door thro which goddess saraswathi stepped in <br />daiy.</p>

<blockquote><p>    noted that kalki and r.k narayan were in employment<br />    of SS vasan of <br />    ananda vikadan at the same time.</p>
<p>    his english artices and stories was published in THE<br />    MERRY MAGAZINE <br />    of the same group</p>
<p>    kalki has written the foreword for the translation<br />    of narayans book<br />    swami and friends which was serialised in<br />    anandavikadan in 1939 and <br />    later published. r.k was paid the princely sum of<br />    500 rupes for his <br />    efforts.</p>
<p>    in the foreword kalki confesses his prejudice<br />    against indians who <br />    chose to write in english. he refused to read swami<br />    and friends first <br />    and had to be compelled to do so. its reported that<br />    he remarked "oh <br />    there are no english books no. so indians have to<br />    write and fill that <br />    gap."<br />    but after 10 pages he seems to have been captivated.<br />    he loudly <br />    wondered why such a fine boook had not been written<br />    directly in tamil <br />    especially because the author was tamilian and had<br />    never been to <br />    england.<br />    kalki says the book was great and he needed no<br />    instigation to move <br />    for its publication in ananda vikadan. but was<br />    concerned how its <br />    translation could be effected.<br />    he ended the foreword witht the hope that r.k would<br />    be happy witht <br />    the reception the tamil readers gave and hence forth<br />    write in his <br />    mother toungue.</p>
<p>    but R.K though very happy with kalki's praise was<br />    not tempted to <br />    follow this piece of advise.<br />    venketesh</p>

<p>  RKN was distantly related to my Dad, so have seen him<br />  couple of times and know the family. I had no idea<br />  Kalki wrote foreword for his stories, that was really<br />  very interesting. RKN, by the way was not pure bred<br />  tamilian, he was part kannadiga, his father was raised<br />  in Karnataka and he moved there to Mysore too very<br />  early on and retained sentiments and love for<br />  Karnataka a lot more than Chennai/TN. He knew to read<br />  and write Tamil and in his later years particularly<br />  read all of Kamba Ramayana and wrote the English<br />  Ramayana based on that. His spoken tamil was what they<br />  call 'kamil', kannada mixed tamil.</p>
<p>  If he ever considered writing in an indian language he<br />  would probably have preferred Kannada. </p>
<p>  By the way, would you mind sending details of the book<br />  you got this from and where I can get it.</p>

<p>    Hi Suneeta</p>
<p>    a repost on the two geniuses R.K and kalki</p>
<p>    kalki and R.K narayan </p>
<p>    on Tue, Apr 10 2007, 10:40 IST</p>
<p>    hi<br />    Just glanced thro R.K Narayan- the early years by<br />    N.Ram and Susan Ram.<br />    noted that kalki and r.k narayan were in employment<br />    of SS vasan of <br />    ananda vikadan at the same time.</p>
<p>    his english artices and stories was published in THE<br />    MERRY MAGAZINE <br />    of the same group</p>
<p>    kalki has written the foreword for the translation<br />    of narayans book<br />    swami and friends which was serialised in<br />    anandavikadan in 1939 and <br />    later published. r.k was paid the princely sum of<br />    500 rupes for his <br />    efforts.</p>
<p>    in the foreword kalki confesses his prejudice<br />    against indians who <br />    chose to write in english. he refused to read swami<br />    and friends first <br />    and had to be compelled to do so. its reported that<br />    he remarked "oh <br />    there are no english books no. so indians have to<br />    write and fill that <br />    gap."<br />    but after 10 pages he seems to have been captivated.<br />    he loudly <br />    wondered why such a fine boook had not been written<br />    directly in tamil <br />    especially because the author was tamilian and had<br />    never been to <br />    england.<br />    kalki says the book was great and he needed no<br />    instigation to move <br />    for its publication in ananda vikadan. but was<br />    concerned how its <br />    translation could be effected.<br />    he ended the foreword witht the hope that r.k would<br />    be happy witht <br />    the reception the tamil readers gave and hence forth<br />    write in his <br />    mother toungue.</p>
<p>    but R.K though very happy with kalki's praise was<br />    not tempted to <br />    follow this piece of advise.<br />    venketesh</p>

<p>      Reading Kalki's Thyaga Bhoomi reminded me of<br />    R.K.Narayan's Dark Room<br />      which was written in 1930s. Wonder when Thyaga<br />    Bhoomi was written.<br />      The heroine in Narayan's novel is a simple<br />    submissive housewife <br />    (also<br />      called Savitri!) whose husband is cruel to her and<br />    neglects her for <br />    a<br />      new lady in his office. Many insults later, she<br />    leaves home and<br />      survives for a few days by eating rice prasadam at<br />    a koil. She comes<br />      back because she realises that she can't do this<br />    forever and for her<br />      children, but her one act of defiance has changed<br />    things at their<br />      home. It is a very nice novel, but of course<br />    Thyaga Bhoomi has a <br />    more<br />      positive ending. </p>

<p>        My grandmother used to say what a huge<br />    controversy the<br />        story ending created, women casting out husbands<br />    or<br />        even speaking up for themselves was unknown in<br />    those<br />        days and Kalki was brave to make his heroine<br />    that way.</p>

<p>            There are humpteen good things in our<br />    society and<br />          no one talks <br />          about<br />            it.

        <p>Venkatesh, I stand corrected on Tyaga Bhoomi<br />timelines, thank you and also for the most interesting<br />post on RKN and Kalki.</p>
<p>RKN was distantly related to my Dad, so have seen him<br />couple of times and know the family. I had no idea<br />Kalki wrote foreword for his stories, that was really<br />very interesting. RKN, by the way was not pure bred<br />tamilian, he was part kannadiga, his father was raised<br />in Karnataka and he moved there to Mysore too very<br />early on and retained sentiments and love for<br />Karnataka a lot more than Chennai/TN. He knew to read<br />and write Tamil and in his later years particularly<br />read all of Kamba Ramayana and wrote the English<br />Ramayana based on that. His spoken tamil was what they<br />call 'kamil', kannada mixed tamil.</p>
<p>If he ever considered writing in an indian language he<br />would probably have preferred Kannada. </p>
<p>By the way, would you mind sending details of the book<br />you got this from and where I can get it.</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>  on Tue, Apr 10 2007, 10:40 IST</p>
<p>  hi<br />  Just glanced thro R.K Narayan- the early years by<br />  N.Ram and Susan Ram.<br />  noted that kalki and r.k narayan were in employment<br />  of SS vasan of <br />  ananda vikadan at the same time.</p>
<p>  his english artices and stories was published in THE<br />  MERRY MAGAZINE <br />  of the same group</p>
<p>  kalki has written the foreword for the translation<br />  of narayans book<br />  swami and friends which was serialised in<br />  anandavikadan in 1939 and <br />  later published. r.k was paid the princely sum of<br />  500 rupes for his <br />  efforts.</p>
<p>  in the foreword kalki confesses his prejudice<br />  against indians who <br />  chose to write in english. he refused to read swami<br />  and friends first <br />  and had to be compelled to do so. its reported that<br />  he remarked "oh <br />  there are no english books no. so indians have to<br />  write and fill that <br />  gap."<br />  but after 10 pages he seems to have been captivated.<br />  he loudly <br />  wondered why such a fine boook had not been written<br />  directly in tamil <br />  especially because the author was tamilian and had<br />  never been to <br />  england.<br />  kalki says the book was great and he needed no<br />  instigation to move <br />  for its publication in ananda vikadan. but was<br />  concerned how its <br />  translation could be effected.<br />  he ended the foreword witht the hope that r.k would<br />  be happy witht <br />  the reception the tamil readers gave and hence forth<br />  write in his <br />  mother toungue.</p>
<p>  but R.K though very happy with kalki's praise was<br />  not tempted to <br />  follow this piece of advise.<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>    Reading Kalki's Thyaga Bhoomi reminded me of<br />  R.K.Narayan's Dark Room<br />    which was written in 1930s. Wonder when Thyaga<br />  Bhoomi was written.<br />    The heroine in Narayan's novel is a simple<br />  submissive housewife <br />  (also<br />    called Savitri!) whose husband is cruel to her and<br />  neglects her for <br />  a<br />    new lady in his office. Many insults later, she<br />  leaves home and<br />    survives for a few days by eating rice prasadam at<br />  a koil. She comes<br />    back because she realises that she can't do this<br />  forever and for her<br />    children, but her one act of defiance has changed<br />  things at their<br />    home. It is a very nice novel, but of course<br />  Thyaga Bhoomi has a <br />  more<br />    positive ending. </p>

<p>      Perhaps the most progressive of Kalki's women<br />  was<br />      Savitri of Tyaga Bhoomi, in my humble opinion.<br />  Savitri<br />      is cast out by her husband and his family when<br />  she is<br />      pregnant, without any money or anyone to go to.<br />  On her<br />      own she finds a distant relative, becomes a<br />  graduate<br />      and a very rich woman in middle age.</p>
<p>      When she is well known her husband Sridhar comes<br />  back<br />      looking for her and seeks reunion. Savitri asks<br />  the<br />      'dharwan' or watchman to remove him from the<br />  house.<br />      She later joins the freedom struggle.</p>
<p>      My grandmother used to say what a huge<br />  controversy the<br />      story ending created, women casting out husbands<br />  or<br />      even speaking up for themselves was unknown in<br />  those<br />      days and Kalki was brave to make his heroine<br />  that way.</p>

<p>        this was another common thread in many of<br />  kalki's<br />        books</p>
<p>        a young woman marrying an elder man. starting<br />  from<br />        sembiyan madevi <br />        who recalls her story, nandini, kalyani......</p>

<p>        But she inherits all the property <br />        and<br />          manages them efficiently. one of her<br />  husbands<br />        distant relative, who<br />          wants to acquire all her wealth fails time<br />  and<br />        again, because she <br />        was<br />          so powerful.</p>
<p>          This story, I think was written in<br />        pre-independence era. Even if <br />        its<br />          Kalki's imagination, writers always take<br />        inspiration from the<br />          prevailing society. </p>
<p>          I have not seen the movie 'water'. But I<br />  feel, all<br />        those people who<br />          criticize, not just the state of women<br />  (widow),<br />        but anything in <br />        indian<br />          culture, especially hindu's practice, try<br />  to find<br />        a dot in a huge<br />          madil suvar and blow it out of proportion.</p>
<p>          A person with a clear mind will enjoy a 70mm<br />  movie<br />        on the big <br />        screen,<br />          and people who want to find fault will<br />  definitely<br />        discover a small<br />          black dot at the corner of the 70mm screen.</p>
<p>          There are humpteen good things in our<br />  society and<br />        no one talks <br />        about<br />          it. But one or two misdeeds here and<br />  there......we<br />        get lots of <br />        social<br />          workers to raise there voice against it.</p>

She comes<br />  back because she realises that she can't do this forever and for her<br />  children, but her one act of defiance has changed things at their<br />  home.

<p>    Perhaps the most progressive of Kalki's women was<br />    Savitri of Tyaga Bhoomi, in my humble opinion. Savitri<br />    is cast out by her husband and his family when she is<br />    pregnant, without any money or anyone to go to. On her<br />    own she finds a distant relative, becomes a graduate<br />    and a very rich woman in middle age.</p>
<p>    When she is well known her husband Sridhar comes back<br />    looking for her and seeks reunion. Savitri asks the<br />    'dharwan' or watchman to remove him from the house.<br />    She later joins the freedom struggle.</p>
<p>    My grandmother used to say what a huge controversy the<br />    story ending created, women casting out husbands or<br />    even speaking up for themselves was unknown in those<br />    days and Kalki was brave to make his heroine that way.</p>

<p>        A person with a clear mind will enjoy a 70mm movie<br />      on the big <br />      screen,<br />        and people who want to find fault will definitely<br />      discover a small<br />        black dot at the corner of the 70mm screen.</p>

        <p>Hi Suneeta</p>
<p>a repost on the two geniuses R.K and kalki</p>
<p>kalki and R.K narayan </p>
<p>on Tue, Apr 10 2007, 10:40 IST</p>
<p>hi<br />Just glanced thro R.K Narayan- the early years by N.Ram and Susan Ram.<br />noted that kalki and r.k narayan were in employment of <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  vasan of <br />ananda vikadan at the same time.</acronym></p>
<p>his english artices and stories was published in THE MERRY MAGAZINE <br />of the same group</p>
<p>kalki has written the foreword for the translation of narayans book<br />swami and friends which was serialised in anandavikadan in 1939 and <br />later published. r.k was paid the princely sum of 500 rupes for his <br />efforts.</p>
<p>in the foreword kalki confesses his prejudice against indians who <br />chose to write in english. he refused to read swami and friends first <br />and had to be compelled to do so. its reported that he remarked "oh <br />there are no english books no. so indians have to write and fill that <br />gap."<br />but after 10 pages he seems to have been captivated. he loudly <br />wondered why such a fine boook had not been written directly in tamil <br />especially because the author was tamilian and had never been to <br />england.<br />kalki says the book was great and he needed no instigation to move <br />for its publication in ananda vikadan. but was concerned how its <br />translation could be effected.<br />he ended the foreword witht the hope that r.k would be happy witht <br />the reception the tamil readers gave and hence forth write in his <br />mother toungue.</p>
<p>but R.K though very happy with kalki's praise was not tempted to <br />follow this piece of advise.<br />venketesh</p>

<blockquote><p>  Suneeta, Thyaga Bhoomi was written in 1948, soon after<br />  the freedom struggle. If I remember right Savitri does<br />  not leave voluntarily, she is asked to get out by her<br />  mother in law who constantly demands dowry and husband<br />  who has an affair with his British secretary Susie.<br />  She has no children other than one child she is<br />  pregnant with at that time.</p>
<p>  She eats in temple and then travels on someone's<br />  kindness from Calcuta to her father's village Saavadi<br />  Kuppam, her father has sold all he had and gone to do<br />  service in Congress. Her daughter Chaaru is born in a<br />  government hospital after she passes out on the street<br />  and someone takes her there.</p>
<p>  So the story goes on, her transformation from a timid<br />  village girl to a modern rich educated Uma Rani. It is<br />  a really nice story with freedom struggle interwoven<br />  into it in a very appropriate way.</p>

Many insults later, she<br />    leaves home and<br />    survives for a few days by eating rice prasadam at a<br />    koil. She comes<br />    back because she realises that she can't do this<br />    forever and for her<br />    children, but her one act of defiance has changed<br />    things at their<br />    home. It is a very nice novel, but of course Thyaga<br />    Bhoomi has a more<br />    positive ending. </p>

<p>      Perhaps the most progressive of Kalki's women was<br />      Savitri of Tyaga Bhoomi, in my humble opinion.<br />    Savitri<br />      is cast out by her husband and his family when she<br />    is<br />      pregnant, without any money or anyone to go to. On<br />    her<br />      own she finds a distant relative, becomes a<br />    graduate<br />      and a very rich woman in middle age.</p>
<p>      When she is well known her husband Sridhar comes<br />    back<br />      looking for her and seeks reunion. Savitri asks<br />    the<br />      'dharwan' or watchman to remove him from the<br />    house.<br />      She later joins the freedom struggle.</p>
<p>      My grandmother used to say what a huge controversy<br />    the<br />      story ending created, women casting out husbands<br />    or<br />      even speaking up for themselves was unknown in<br />    those<br />      days and Kalki was brave to make his heroine that<br />    way.</p>

<p>        But she inherits all the property <br />        and<br />          manages them efficiently. one of her husbands<br />        distant relative, who<br />          wants to acquire all her wealth fails time and<br />        again, because she <br />        was<br />          so powerful.</p>
<p>          This story, I think was written in<br />        pre-independence era. Even if <br />        its<br />          Kalki's imagination, writers always take<br />        inspiration from the<br />          prevailing society. </p>

<p>          A person with a clear mind will enjoy a 70mm<br />    movie<br />        on the big <br />        screen,<br />          and people who want to find fault will<br />    definitely<br />        discover a small<br />          black dot at the corner of the 70mm screen.</p>
<p>          There are humpteen good things in our society<br />    and<br />        no one talks <br />        about<br />          it. But one or two misdeeds here and<br />    there......we<br />        get lots of <br />        social<br />          workers to raise there voice against it.</p>

        <p>Suneeta, Thyaga Bhoomi was written in 1948, soon after<br />the freedom struggle. If I remember right Savitri does<br />not leave voluntarily, she is asked to get out by her<br />mother in law who constantly demands dowry and husband<br />who has an affair with his British secretary Susie.<br />She has no children other than one child she is<br />pregnant with at that time.</p>
<p>She eats in temple and then travels on someone's<br />kindness from Calcuta to her father's village Saavadi<br />Kuppam, her father has sold all he had and gone to do<br />service in Congress. Her daughter Chaaru is born in a<br />government hospital after she passes out on the street<br />and someone takes her there.</p>
<p>So the story goes on, her transformation from a timid<br />village girl to a modern rich educated Uma Rani. It is<br />a really nice story with freedom struggle interwoven<br />into it in a very appropriate way.</p>

        <p>Reading Kalki's Thyaga Bhoomi reminded me of R.K.Narayan's Dark Room<br />which was written in 1930s. Wonder when Thyaga Bhoomi was written.<br />The heroine in Narayan's novel is a simple submissive housewife (also<br />called Savitri!) whose husband is cruel to her and neglects her for a<br />new lady in his office. Many insults later, she leaves home and<br />survives for a few days by eating rice prasadam at a koil. She comes<br />back because she realises that she can't do this forever and for her<br />children, but her one act of defiance has changed things at their<br />home. It is a very nice novel, but of course Thyaga Bhoomi has a more<br />positive ending. </p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Malathi Mahadevan <dmaloo@... <br />wrote:</dmaloo@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  Perhaps the most progressive of Kalki's women was<br />  Savitri of Tyaga Bhoomi, in my humble opinion. Savitri<br />  is cast out by her husband and his family when she is<br />  pregnant, without any money or anyone to go to. On her<br />  own she finds a distant relative, becomes a graduate<br />  and a very rich woman in middle age.</p>
<p>  When she is well known her husband Sridhar comes back<br />  looking for her and seeks reunion. Savitri asks the<br />  'dharwan' or watchman to remove him from the house.<br />  She later joins the freedom struggle.</p>
<p>  My grandmother used to say what a huge controversy the<br />  story ending created, women casting out husbands or<br />  even speaking up for themselves was unknown in those<br />  days and Kalki was brave to make his heroine that way.</p>

<p>      In Kalvanin Kathali, the heroin Kalyani is married<br />    to an old man<br />      becomes a widow in a young age. </p>
<p>    this was another common thread in many of kalki's<br />    books</p>
<p>    a young woman marrying an elder man. starting from<br />    sembiyan madevi <br />    who recalls her story, nandini, kalyani......</p>
<p>    venketesh</p>
<p>    But she inherits all the property <br />    and<br />      manages them efficiently. one of her husbands<br />    distant relative, who<br />      wants to acquire all her wealth fails time and<br />    again, because she <br />    was<br />      so powerful.</p>
<p>      This story, I think was written in<br />    pre-independence era. Even if <br />    its<br />      Kalki's imagination, writers always take<br />    inspiration from the<br />      prevailing society. </p>

<p>Well said, Venkat. Along with the bangles, the heart<br />of the women is broken and she is destined to be a<br />walking corpse.</p>
<p>Women should learn self defence ( or atleast grow<br />finger nails ), driving a 2-wheeler and spoken<br />English. They should never bow down to oppression in<br />the name of cultural or religeous practices, never let<br />off the fire with-in and never hesititate to take the<br />"avatar of badrakali" when situation demands.</p>
<p>In cities like Chennai, they can get a good job, make<br />a decent living and bring up their children well.</p>

        <p>Yes Venkatesh, it is true. But if you look at the type<br />of lives these women had, it is hard to hold anything<br />against them. Widowed at 14/16, some married to men<br />more than double their age, some carrying children<br />when they are children themselves...it is not<br />surprising they carried bitterness or anger and could<br />not see other people live. </p>
<p>That is not just about widowhood, it is a fact of<br />life, most people who are treated badly will usually<br />treat others badly as they don't know how else to make<br />up for what they lost. Instead of saying that fault<br />lies with men or women we have to see how to avoid mis<br />treatment of people in the first place. Not showing<br />too much regard for Sati type of rituals itself is a<br />good first step in that direction.</p>

<p>    - 50% of the population would not have had their<br />  mothers living <br />  for long<br />    - more than half the population would have been<br />  deprived of the<br />    relation called 'patti' (or rather any elderly<br />  female relative, <br />  like<br />    athai, periyamma etc)<br />    - Almost 75% of the indian population were sadist<br />  because they were<br />    cruel to widows<br />    - 50% of grandchildren would have missed the bed<br />  time stories from<br />    Grandmothers</p>
<p>    we can go on....Most of us will be attached to<br />  patti's rather than<br />    thatha's. If we were like what is being projected,<br />  I dont think it<br />    would have been possible.</p>
<p>  on the contrary - about 15 years ago - we were<br />  visiting a small <br />  village near tanjore - by six in the evening - every<br />  thinnai in the <br />  agraharam had one window minus n (), sitting - i was<br />  too young at <br />  that time to draw conclusions - but what struck me<br />  was that they all <br />  should have nagged the men folk so much that the<br />  guy found <br />  permanent peace - but the real reason would have<br />  been the age <br />  difference at the time of marriage. </p>
<p>  anyway, they carry a ( m ) tag before the patti and<br />  were a very <br />  very toxic commodity - so much so that the very<br />  mention of their <br />  names drew nightmares from the DIL.i hv seen this in<br />  person when the <br />  m() patti would carry so much venom - that the DIL<br />  would not even be <br />  allowed to have the vege's in the sambar etc. maybe<br />  all that they <br />  have been subjected to, has made their insides turn<br />  to stone and <br />  they just cant stand the change - when they<br />  sufferred so much why <br />  should the new one not...i guess women are equally<br />  to blame</p>

<p>on the contrary - about 15 years ago - we were visiting a small <br />village near tanjore - by six in the evening - every thinnai in the <br />agraharam had one window minus n (), sitting - i was too young at <br />that time to draw conclusions - but what struck me was that they all <br />should have nagged the men folk so much that the guy found <br />permanent peace - but the real reason would have been the age <br />difference at the time of marriage. </p>
<p>anyway, they carry a ( m ) tag before the patti and were a very <br />very toxic commodity - so much so that the very mention of their <br />names drew nightmares from the DIL.i hv seen this in person when the <br />m() patti would carry so much venom - that the DIL would not even be <br />allowed to have the vege's in the sambar etc. maybe all that they <br />have been subjected to, has made their insides turn to stone and <br />they just cant stand the change - when they sufferred so much why <br />should the new one not...i guess women are equally to blame</p>

        <p>Perhaps the most progressive of Kalki's women was<br />Savitri of Tyaga Bhoomi, in my humble opinion. Savitri<br />is cast out by her husband and his family when she is<br />pregnant, without any money or anyone to go to. On her<br />own she finds a distant relative, becomes a graduate<br />and a very rich woman in middle age.</p>
<p>When she is well known her husband Sridhar comes back<br />looking for her and seeks reunion. Savitri asks the<br />'dharwan' or watchman to remove him from the house.<br />She later joins the freedom struggle.</p>
<p>My grandmother used to say what a huge controversy the<br />story ending created, women casting out husbands or<br />even speaking up for themselves was unknown in those<br />days and Kalki was brave to make his heroine that way.</p>
<p>--- "R.venketesh" <abhivencat@yahoo.com  wrote:</p></abhivencat@yahoo.com></p>
<blockquote>
<p>    In Kalvanin Kathali, the heroin Kalyani is married<br />  to an old man<br />    becomes a widow in a young age. </p>
<p>  this was another common thread in many of kalki's<br />  books</p>
<p>  a young woman marrying an elder man. starting from<br />  sembiyan madevi <br />  who recalls her story, nandini, kalyani......</p>
<p>  venketesh</p>
<p>  But she inherits all the property <br />  and<br />    manages them efficiently. one of her husbands<br />  distant relative, who<br />    wants to acquire all her wealth fails time and<br />  again, because she <br />  was<br />    so powerful.</p>
<p>    This story, I think was written in<br />  pre-independence era. Even if <br />  its<br />    Kalki's imagination, writers always take<br />  inspiration from the<br />    prevailing society. </p>
<p>    I have not seen the movie 'water'. But I feel, all<br />  those people who<br />    criticize, not just the state of women (widow),<br />  but anything in <br />  indian<br />    culture, especially hindu's practice, try to find<br />  a dot in a huge<br />    madil suvar and blow it out of proportion.</p>
<p>    A person with a clear mind will enjoy a 70mm movie<br />  on the big <br />  screen,<br />    and people who want to find fault will definitely<br />  discover a small<br />    black dot at the corner of the 70mm screen.</p>
<p>    There are humpteen good things in our society and<br />  no one talks <br />  about<br />    it. But one or two misdeeds here and there......we<br />  get lots of <br />  social<br />    workers to raise there voice against it.</p>

        <p>Satish, am not sure what statistics you are comparing,<br />for one thing it is not related. Having a grand parent<br />who tells stories does not mean she was treated well,<br />my great grandmother was a mottai patti who told<br />stories till the day she died. We loved her dearly but<br />we were children. She was widowed at 16, and never<br />wore anything other than widow's garb and sandal on<br />her head. Her head was shaved off her long locks.</p>
<p>There is not much you can infer from statistics , be<br />it true or false. And our personal family experiences<br />do not necessarily correlate to bigger worldly<br />situations.</p>

        <p>Yes, well said Venkatesh. Upper middle class urbanites<br />are somehow often confused between being<br />positive/seeing what is good in culture and having<br />empathy and understanding for what is not so good at<br />the same time.</p>
<p>Treatment of widows has improved only recently, that<br />too more because of more women working. The general<br />attitude especially in orthodox hindu families still<br />has a long way to go. My great grandmother was a<br />'mottai patti' as they used to call, shaved and<br />confined to dark rooms, not allowed to come in front<br />of men or priests or in functions. Her daughter was<br />marginally better, no shaving, but still always<br />thought of as 'thaali aruthaval' and never allowed<br />dignity and presence in functions. Her daughter, my<br />aunt, also widowed, worked as a teacher and was<br />widowed just 15 years ago. She has much better status,<br />is a working woman and is able to participate in<br />functions and like anyone else. That is a sign of<br />improving times, atleast for those of us who make a<br />middle class living. The people like those shown in<br />'water' are poor and below poverty level. For them<br />things are very similar. The numbers of women begging<br />on the streets of Varanasi is phenomenal. Female<br />infanticide is a very common and unresolved issue in<br />villages in Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>Talking of all this does not make us in any way<br />pessmistic or 'blowing out of proportion', it only<br />increases awareness to do what we can do. Thinking any<br />problem that is not directly concerned with me or my<br />direct circle of people does not exist is just<br />indifference.</p>

<p>  no. I differ.</p>
<p>  in urbanised populations perhaps yes. but down in<br />  the villages , even <br />  in well to do or cultured families the bangle<br />  breaking ceremony etc <br />  happens.</p>
<p>  customs related to death are the slowest to change<br />  in any community.<br />  even the path taken to a graveyard seldom changes.<br />  this conflict we see more often in the expansion of<br />  madras in the ecr <br />  and omr. people dont want to take an alternate path<br />  and almost every <br />  community has 2 graveyards for hindus alone.</p></blockquote>

        <p>I also know another lady who when her husband passed away opted to <br />wear white , though her children were against it. Things are <br />certainly blown out of proportion in movies to make matters " <br />Cinematic"</p>
<p>no. I differ.</p>
<p>in urbanised populations perhaps yes. but down in the villages , even <br />in well to do or cultured families the bangle breaking ceremony etc <br />happens.</p>
<p>customs related to death are the slowest to change in any community.<br />even the path taken to a graveyard seldom changes.<br />this conflict we see more often in the expansion of madras in the ecr <br />and omr. people dont want to take an alternate path and almost every <br />community has 2 graveyards for hindus alone.</p>

        <p>On the lighter side of this topic.</p>
<p>If whatever has been said about the state of Widows in India (let it<br />be movies or media or anything) is true and actually happened, then<br />till recently, say a 100 years back, </p>
<p>- 50% of the population would not have had their mothers living for long<br />- more than half the population would have been deprived of the<br />relation called 'patti' (or rather any elderly female relative, like<br />athai, periyamma etc)<br />- Almost 75% of the indian population were sadist because they were<br />cruel to widows<br />- 50% of grandchildren would have missed the bed time stories from<br />Grandmothers</p>
<p>we can go on....Most of us will be attached to patti's rather than<br />thatha's. If we were like what is being projected, I dont think it<br />would have been possible.</p>

<p>Is it always so black and white? My experience is different. In the late<br />forties and early fifties, I had about 8 to 10 relatives who were<br />widows, in the age group 30 to 70. I remember only one among them<br />wearing a white saree and with shaven head. The rest wore normal<br />colouresd sarees; they were active and as far I remember were not<br />discriminated or kept in isolation. Some were really powerful and<br />managed family affairs efficiently.</p>
<p>I do not deny that the other extreme was also present. Some accepted the<br />extreme form as a 'vrat', some followed the middle path either<br />voluntarily or due to social pressure and a few had to suffer due to<br />cruelty from immediate kith and kin. Even today wives and widows have to<br />face varying degree of hardship from husbands, in-laws or in some cases<br />even from parents and siblings.</p>

        <p>Thanks Satish, I believe over time all 'history'<br />becomes 'legend', that is mixed with imagination and<br />morals/beliefs of the interpretators, as the Ramayana<br />has. It has its origins in something that happened but<br />nobody really knows what actually happened, how much<br />of it was history, how much of it was the<br />author/writer's imagination and how much of it is our<br />own imagination as we read.</p>
<p>Half the things we hear about in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  for example, the<br />battle glories of the Cholas, were blood and violence,<br />most of it happened, our mind masks the reality<br />assisted by the beauty of the writing that is all. It<br />is no different for the Mahabharat or parts of the<br />Ramayana.</acronym></p>
<p>We love <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ,<br />--- SatishKumar Arunachalam <satisharun@gmail.com <br />wrote:</satisharun@gmail.com></acronym></p>

<p>  In Hindi 'Ithihaas' is history..in Tamil too<br />  Ithigaasam is history.<br />  Then how can it mean legend?

<p>In Hindi 'Ithihaas' is history..in Tamil too Ithigaasam is history.<br />Then how can it mean legend? Legend is 'karna paramparai kathai'.<br />Our ancestors were very clear about what they said.

<p>    Preface</p>
<p>  -------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-------------</p>
<p>    The tAra gItA is from the KiShkindhA kANDa of the<br />    adhyAtma rAmAyaNa.<br />    The adhyAtma rAmAyaNa is said to be very popular<br />    among the followers<br />    of the Saint Ramananda who preached ShrI<br />    RAmAnujAchArya's teachings in<br />    Northern India and promoted rAma-bhakti. This has<br />    led some modern<br />    scholars to suspect that the adhyAtma rAmAyaNa was<br />    actually written by<br />    Ramananda himself and was added to the BrahmANDa<br />    purANa. But this is<br />    hard to justify, without finding out more about what<br />    Ramananda's<br />    beliefs were. Some of the ideas in this rAmAyaNa<br />    clearly are in<br />    conflict with RAmAnuja's, for example, those of<br />    mAyA, the mithyAtva of<br />    saMsAra which is like a dream, and so on. The only<br />    other place where I<br />    can find these ideas so clearly expressed is in the<br />    ShrImad BhAgavata<br />    purANa. It is very possible, in my opinion, that the<br />    author of the<br />    adhyAtma rAmAyaNa was influenced by the BhAgavata.<br />    One example, where<br />    both are very similar is the birth of rAma/krishNa.<br />    The BhAgavata says<br />    that kriShNa was born as the four-armed ViShNu<br />    Himself. In the<br />    adhyAtma rAmAyaNa, rAma is born similarly, not as a<br />    normal human<br />    child, but as the four-armed ViShNu with all His<br />    paraphernalia.<br />    KausalyA then offers prayers to Him and only later<br />    does He assume the<br />    form of a normal human infant.</p>
<p>    ShrI rAma instructs tArA -1</p>
<p>  -------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-------------</p>
<p>    After rAma killed the lord of tArA, the vAnara chief<br />    vAlI, she was<br />    overcome by sorrow and begged rAma to end her life<br />    too as He did<br />    vAlI's. But rAma consoled her with words filled with<br />    wisdom and<br />    compassion. Thereafter, tArA, desirous of knowing<br />    more about jiiva and<br />    Atman (the Self), questioned rAma as follows:</p>
<p>    deho .achitkAShThavadrAma jIvo nityashchidAtmakaH |<br />    sukhaduHkhAdisaMbandhaH kasya syAdrAma me vada ||</p>
<p>    O rAma! The body is without consciousness<br />    (insentient) just like a<br />    piece of wood. But the jIva (individual soul) is<br />    eternal and of the<br />    nature of Consciousness. Whose is this relation to<br />    happiness and<br />    sorrow? Please tell me, O rAma!</p>
<p>    shrIrAma uvAcha :</p>
<p>    shrIrAma said:</p>
<p>    ahaMkArAdisaMbandho yAvaddehendriyaiH saha |<br />    saMsArastAvadeva syAdAtmanastvavivekinaH ||</p>
<p>    As long as there is the relation of "I and mine"<br />    with the body and<br />    senses, there will exist saMsAra (phenomenal<br />    existence) for the person<br />    who lacks viveka (discrimination between eternal and<br />    non- eternal<br />    things).</p>
<p>    mithyAropitasaMsAro na svayaM vinivartate |<br />    viShayA dhyAyamAnasya svapne mithyAgamo yathA ||</p>
<p>    This saMsAra is falsely superimposed (on the Self)<br />    and does not go<br />    away on its own for a person who broods over the<br />    objects of the<br />    senses. This samsAra is just like a dream which too<br />    does not end on<br />    its own (but ends when one wakes up.)</p>
<p>    anAdyavidyAsaMbandhAttatkAryAhaMkR^itestathA |<br />    saMsAro .apArthako .api syAdrAgadveShAdisaN^kulaH ||</p>
<p>    By the relation (association) with beginningless<br />    avidyA (ajnAna,<br />    ignorance) and with the effect of avidyA - ahaMkAra<br />    (ego), the<br />    saMsAra, characterized by attractions and aversions,<br />    exists even<br />    though it is meaningless.</p>
<p>    mana eva hi saMsAro bandhashchaiva manaH shubhe |<br />    AtmA manaH samAnatvametya tadgatabandhabhAk.h ||</p>
<p>    The mind (manas) alone is (subject to) saMsAra and<br />    bondage, O<br />    Auspicious One! The Atman gets identified with the<br />    mind and shares the<br />    bonds affecting the mind.</p>
<p>    yadA vishuddhaH sphaTiko .alaktAdisamIpagaH |<br />    tattadvarNayugAbhAti vastuto nAsti raJNjanaM ||</p>
<p>    Just as a clear crystal placed near red dye, etc.,<br />    appears to be<br />    tainted with color, but in reality there is no stain<br />    (in the crystal),</p>
<p>    buddhIndriyaadisAmIpyAdAtmanaH saMsR^itirbalAt.h |<br />    AtmA svaliN^gaM tu manaH parigR^ihya tadudbhavAn ||</p>

<p>    shuklalohitakR^iShNAni gatayastatsamAnataH |<br />    evaM karmavashaajjIvo bhramatyAbhUtasaMplavaM ||</p>
<p>    Due to the proximity of the Atman with the intellect<br />    (buddhi), senses,<br />    etc., It (Atman) is forced into saMsAra. The Atman<br />    identifies Itself<br />    with its own reflection (in ) the Manas, and enjoys<br />    the desires<br />    arising from that (ie. the mind). It (the Atman)<br />    thus becomes bound by<br />    the guNas qualities) and remains helpless in<br />    saMsAra. First the mind<br />    creates the guNas white (Sattva), red (rajas), and<br />    black (tamas), and<br />    then creates the works and their results according<br />    to those guNas.<br />    Thus, under the control of karma, the Jiiva revolves<br />    (in the cycle of<br />    transmigration, ie. repeated births and deaths),<br />    from the beginning of<br />    creation to the end of the cosmic cycle (pralaya).</p>
<p>    sarvopasaMhR^itau jIvo vAsanAbhiH svakarmabhiH |<br />    anAdyavidyAvashagastiShThatyabhiniveShataH ||</p>
<p>    When the whole cosmic cycle winds up, the jIva along<br />    with its latent<br />    tendencies (vAsanAs) and karmas (which are yet to<br />    fructify) remains<br />    submerged in the beginningless avidyA (ignorance)<br />    and under its<br />    control.</p>
<p>    sR^iShTikAle punaH pUrvavAsanAmAnasaiH saha |<br />    jAyate punarapyeyaM ghaTIyantramivAvashaH ||</p>
<p>    At the time of the cosmic creation, this Jiiva, once<br />    again, is born<br />    along with its prior vAsanAs and the mind. The Jiiva<br />    thus keeps<br />    revolving in saMsAra helplessly like the bucket that<br />    is used to draw<br />    water from a well.</p>
<p>    The simile here is explained as follows. In India,<br />    where there is only</p>

<p>  Preface</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>  The tAra gItA is from the KiShkindhA kANDa of the<br />  adhyAtma rAmAyaNa.<br />  The adhyAtma rAmAyaNa is said to be very popular<br />  among the followers<br />  of the Saint Ramananda who preached ShrI<br />  RAmAnujAchArya's teachings in<br />  Northern India and promoted rAma-bhakti. This has<br />  led some modern<br />  scholars to suspect that the adhyAtma rAmAyaNa was<br />  actually written by<br />  Ramananda himself and was added to the BrahmANDa<br />  purANa. But this is<br />  hard to justify, without finding out more about what<br />  Ramananda's<br />  beliefs were. Some of the ideas in this rAmAyaNa<br />  clearly are in<br />  conflict with RAmAnuja's, for example, those of<br />  mAyA, the mithyAtva of<br />  saMsAra which is like a dream, and so on. The only<br />  other place where I<br />  can find these ideas so clearly expressed is in the<br />  ShrImad BhAgavata<br />  purANa. It is very possible, in my opinion, that the<br />  author of the<br />  adhyAtma rAmAyaNa was influenced by the BhAgavata.<br />  One example, where<br />  both are very similar is the birth of rAma/krishNa.<br />  The BhAgavata says<br />  that kriShNa was born as the four-armed ViShNu<br />  Himself. In the<br />  adhyAtma rAmAyaNa, rAma is born similarly, not as a<br />  normal human<br />  child, but as the four-armed ViShNu with all His<br />  paraphernalia.<br />  KausalyA then offers prayers to Him and only later<br />  does He assume the<br />  form of a normal human infant.</p>
<p>  ShrI rAma instructs tArA -1</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>  After rAma killed the lord of tArA, the vAnara chief<br />  vAlI, she was<br />  overcome by sorrow and begged rAma to end her life<br />  too as He did<br />  vAlI's. But rAma consoled her with words filled with<br />  wisdom and<br />  compassion. Thereafter, tArA, desirous of knowing<br />  more about jiiva and<br />  Atman (the Self), questioned rAma as follows:</p>
<p>  deho .achitkAShThavadrAma jIvo nityashchidAtmakaH |<br />  sukhaduHkhAdisaMbandhaH kasya syAdrAma me vada ||</p>
<p>  O rAma! The body is without consciousness<br />  (insentient) just like a<br />  piece of wood. But the jIva (individual soul) is<br />  eternal and of the<br />  nature of Consciousness. Whose is this relation to<br />  happiness and<br />  sorrow? Please tell me, O rAma!</p>
<p>  shrIrAma uvAcha :</p>
<p>  shrIrAma said:</p>
<p>  ahaMkArAdisaMbandho yAvaddehendriyaiH saha |<br />  saMsArastAvadeva syAdAtmanastvavivekinaH ||</p>
<p>  As long as there is the relation of "I and mine"<br />  with the body and<br />  senses, there will exist saMsAra (phenomenal<br />  existence) for the person<br />  who lacks viveka (discrimination between eternal and<br />  non- eternal<br />  things).</p>
<p>  mithyAropitasaMsAro na svayaM vinivartate |<br />  viShayA dhyAyamAnasya svapne mithyAgamo yathA ||</p>
<p>  This saMsAra is falsely superimposed (on the Self)<br />  and does not go<br />  away on its own for a person who broods over the<br />  objects of the<br />  senses. This samsAra is just like a dream which too<br />  does not end on<br />  its own (but ends when one wakes up.)</p>
<p>  anAdyavidyAsaMbandhAttatkAryAhaMkR^itestathA |<br />  saMsAro .apArthako .api syAdrAgadveShAdisaN^kulaH ||</p>
<p>  By the relation (association) with beginningless<br />  avidyA (ajnAna,<br />  ignorance) and with the effect of avidyA - ahaMkAra<br />  (ego), the<br />  saMsAra, characterized by attractions and aversions,<br />  exists even<br />  though it is meaningless.</p>
<p>  mana eva hi saMsAro bandhashchaiva manaH shubhe |<br />  AtmA manaH samAnatvametya tadgatabandhabhAk.h ||</p>
<p>  The mind (manas) alone is (subject to) saMsAra and<br />  bondage, O<br />  Auspicious One! The Atman gets identified with the<br />  mind and shares the<br />  bonds affecting the mind.</p>
<p>  yadA vishuddhaH sphaTiko .alaktAdisamIpagaH |<br />  tattadvarNayugAbhAti vastuto nAsti raJNjanaM ||</p>
<p>  Just as a clear crystal placed near red dye, etc.,<br />  appears to be<br />  tainted with color, but in reality there is no stain<br />  (in the crystal),</p>
<p>  buddhIndriyaadisAmIpyAdAtmanaH saMsR^itirbalAt.h |<br />  AtmA svaliN^gaM tu manaH parigR^ihya tadudbhavAn ||</p>

<p>  shuklalohitakR^iShNAni gatayastatsamAnataH |<br />  evaM karmavashaajjIvo bhramatyAbhUtasaMplavaM ||</p>
<p>  Due to the proximity of the Atman with the intellect<br />  (buddhi), senses,<br />  etc., It (Atman) is forced into saMsAra. The Atman<br />  identifies Itself<br />  with its own reflection (in ) the Manas, and enjoys<br />  the desires<br />  arising from that (ie. the mind). It (the Atman)<br />  thus becomes bound by<br />  the guNas qualities) and remains helpless in<br />  saMsAra. First the mind<br />  creates the guNas white (Sattva), red (rajas), and<br />  black (tamas), and<br />  then creates the works and their results according<br />  to those guNas.<br />  Thus, under the control of karma, the Jiiva revolves<br />  (in the cycle of<br />  transmigration, ie. repeated births and deaths),<br />  from the beginning of<br />  creation to the end of the cosmic cycle (pralaya).</p>
<p>  sarvopasaMhR^itau jIvo vAsanAbhiH svakarmabhiH |<br />  anAdyavidyAvashagastiShThatyabhiniveShataH ||</p>
<p>  When the whole cosmic cycle winds up, the jIva along<br />  with its latent<br />  tendencies (vAsanAs) and karmas (which are yet to<br />  fructify) remains<br />  submerged in the beginningless avidyA (ignorance)<br />  and under its<br />  control.</p>
<p>  sR^iShTikAle punaH pUrvavAsanAmAnasaiH saha |<br />  jAyate punarapyeyaM ghaTIyantramivAvashaH ||</p>
<p>  At the time of the cosmic creation, this Jiiva, once<br />  again, is born<br />  along with its prior vAsanAs and the mind. The Jiiva<br />  thus keeps<br />  revolving in saMsAra helplessly like the bucket that<br />  is used to draw<br />  water from a well.</p>
<p>  The simile here is explained as follows. In India,<br />  where there is only</p>

<p>The simile here is explained as follows. In India, where there is only<br />well water available, but no electricity, water is lifted out of the<br />well by means of a bucket attached to a rope. Just as the bucket is<br />repeatedly immersed in water and then pulled out to draw water, the<br />Jiiva too revolves in the universe alternating between being submerged<br />in avidyA with its latent vAsanAs and karmas, and being thrust into<br />the transmigratory process again at the time of cosmic creation.</p>

        <p>Sampath, i thought itihaasam is legend, not history.<br />Could be either way. Legend makes better sense to me.</p>
<p>Yes widows were treating miserably, we don't have to<br />go as far as silambu for that, even during the time<br />Kalki penned Thyaga bhoomi brahmin widows were shaved<br />and confined to dark rooms. Kalki was among the many<br />brahmin patriot social reformers who opposed that<br />strongly.</p>
<p>It is very romantic and inspiring to have a love story<br />where one cannot live without another. But in real<br />life it is rarely that way, and generally speaking too<br />death does not solve any problem. Kopperun devi did<br />not inspire anyone to treat widows with respect by<br />dying with her husband. I'd rather prefer someone like<br />Madhurantakan's mother who lived through widowhood<br />devoted to Bhakti (or any other cause).</p>

<p>    Venkatesh, ok then fine. Am just saying there is<br />  no<br />    reference to Sati in Ramayana or Mahabharat<br />  either.<br />    The only two women who committed SAti in these two<br />    epics are Mandodhari and Pandu's wife Madri both<br />  of<br />    whom had specific reasons. Mandodhari had lost<br />    everything and kingdom taken over by rivals, like<br />    Rajput jauhar she had to go, Madri was responsible<br />  for<br />    Pandu's death and she committed suicide.</p>
<p>    This whole Sati thing was introduced later on, yes<br />    Kopperundevi is the lady in Silappadhikaram who<br />  dies<br />    with her husband.</p>

<p>        Kamba Ramayana in my humble opinion was<br />  greatly in<br />        accordance with Kambar's times and had lot<br />  more<br />        patriarchy/male dominance than the original.<br />  Do<br />      not<br />        mean to deviate from PS. Sorry.</p>
<p>      dont you worry from deviating as long its not<br />      contreversial</p>
<p>      we have in the past discussed many more<br />  historical<br />      topics.</p>
<p>      right now that we are in ramayana i read in a<br />  site<br />      the surpanaka's <br />      original name was meenakshi?</p>
<p>      could it be true?</p>

<p>            Second is when Sundara chola passed away<br />  and<br />          Vanavan Madevi commits <br />              Sati. </p>
<p>          Just yesterday i was discussing with diwakar<br />  sir<br />          about the treatment <br />          of Vaali's wife ( angadan mother - taara) in<br />          vaalmiki and kamba <br />          ramayan. post vaali's death ( murder??) what<br />      happens<br />          to her is shown <br />          very differently.</p>
<p>          similarly sita going through the agni<br />  paritchai<br />      is<br />          also entirely <br />          different..</p>
