<p>Dear Vairam, </p>
<p>DR. KALAIKKOVAN, great son of Great Father Dr. Maa. Raasamanickanar, <br />who is an Authority in PALLAVAR VARALAARU ( Re Chozhar varalaru it <br />is KAN Sastry, Re Pandiar Varalaaru it is Sadhasiva Pandarathar )- <br />whose Centenary just concluded, used to say that we should put <br />efforts in finding TRUE HISTORY .. !~</p>
<p>About 5 years back, when we (Gokul - Kamal - Lanvaya - Ram - Krupa <br />and me among others ) listened to this WE did not understand the <br />REAL MEANING of this.. </p>
<p>Now at I realise that what we read or assume know is no were near <br />Truth and hardly efforts are on in this Direction.</p>
<p>I agree with you that THERE IS NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE IN THIS <br />DIRECTION .. All are based on the Iraiyanar Agapporul Nool .. which <br />itself needs authentification ..</p>
<p>1. Rift between the followers of Siva - Vishnu :: The recorded <br />evidences point 11th / 12th Century .. Nothing prior to 10th <br />Century.</p>
<p>Therefore period of SIVA VACKIAR need to be ascertained based on <br />cdertain dedtails. </p>
<p>I will also post evidence that followers of VISHNU displayed <br />VIBOOTHI in their Foreheads - during Bakthi period (8th Century ) <br />and THIRUVOYMOZHI was hymned in Siva Temples during Naayanmar period <br />(same 7th / 8 th Century).</p>
<p>There have been several " Idaicherugals " in History .. related to <br />traditions, literature and religion ..</p>
<p>Dr. Kalaikkovan (and Dr. Nalini) - by virtue of their exposure to <br />several facts - Truth - should have understood what is believed / <br />discussed widely and what is the reality..</p>
<p>To emlighten (history) infants like me, they revealed 5 years back <br />(some examples )::</p>
<p>1. Thanjai Big Temple Kalasm shadow does fall on the ground ..</p>
<p>2. Sigaram is not made of single stone of 80 tons as widely <br />believed..</p>
<p>3. Pillayarpatti is not Vinayaga Temple as widely believed .. it is <br />(Old) Siva Temple with Ayyanar in worship .. Sivalingam South <br />facing..</p>
<p>4. Pillayarpatti Kudavarai is NOT PALLAVA Kudavarai as widely <br />believed (even it is postulated that Pallavas are pioneers on <br />this).. but it is PANDYA KUDAVARAI .. ( with the technology learnt <br />through Jain sculptures !! )</p>
<p>And advised us to look for True History ...</p>
<p>and varalaaru.com was promoted in that direction .. !!</p>
<p>That is why I defer to quote Wikipedia (Source Authorless - but <br />collective and subjected to editing ) in discussions ..</p>
<p>Re BOGHAR, our Dear Member VIJAY has already posted certain details <br />in our Group earlier.<br />anbudan / sps</p>

<p>  Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai<br />  The IAS saw its modest beginning in 1982 at Tiruvanmiyur, a <br />  spiritual centre hallowed in the ancient literary and cultural <br />  traditions of Asia. Since then it has grown to become one of <br />India's <br />  premier indological research and publication institutes.</p>
<p>  Recently the Institute acquired two acres of choice land in <br />  Kanchipuram to launch a Bodhidharma Centre for Indian Philosophy, <br />  named after the South Indian Buddhist monk who traveled to China <br />in <br />  the 8th century AD and started the Ch'an (Japanese Zen) school of <br />  Mahayana Buddhism.</p>

<p>    could all this be true</p>
<p>    Kalangi Nathar was the guru of Bhogarnathar or Bhogar. Kalangi <br />    Nathar was from Benaras.</p>
<p>    Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. In <br />  China <br />    he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi in <br />  China <br />    was the successor of Kalangi Nathar(Confucius).</p>
<p>    Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar (a mystic, yogi). He <br />  was <br />    said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New Age <br />    circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. Bhogar <br />was <br />  a <br />    South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, who <br />    became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. In <br />    Bogar's Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />    preparations to his disciple Pullippani (so named as he is <br />  believed <br />    to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger) and at <br />every <br />    stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani must <br />  have <br />    been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a balaka.</p>
<p>    It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />  proceeded <br />    to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />  journey <br />    is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />    demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction of <br />the <br />    aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />steam <br />    engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />demonstrated <br />  by <br />    Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.</p>
<p>    Bogar's guru, Kālāngi Nāthar, is believed to be a Chinese who <br />    attained siddhi in South India and thus became included among <br />the <br />    Eighteen Siddhars.</p>
<p>    Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism (5th century B.C.) was the first <br />    Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the male <br />  Yang <br />    and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of Shiva -</p>
<p>    Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept was <br />  first <br />    revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is as <br />old <br />    as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 B.C. <br />  Also <br />    alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. 135 <br />  and <br />    was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree was <br />    enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by the <br />    Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />existing <br />    Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir Refined <br />  in <br />    Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.</p>
<p>    The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter <br />and <br />    the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about <br />the <br />    same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went under <br />  the <br />    name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi Sriramadevar, <br />  who <br />    was known as Yacob in Arabia.</p>
<p>    This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the concept <br />of <br />    duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />  alchemy <br />    as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />  after <br />    Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher <br />the <br />    emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy have <br />    been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao Tse <br />by <br />    centuries.</p>
<p>    Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings <br />will <br />    suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine he <br />    used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing these <br />9 <br />    poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />  Master <br />    Medicine ( One medicine to cure all disease ). Thirumoolar also <br />    discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />With <br />    the consultation of Agasthiar ( Father of Ayurvedic Medicine) <br />and <br />    other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons ( Nava Bashanam ) and <br />  made <br />    the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />currently <br />    worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near Palani <br />    Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />  mixed <br />    the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.</p>
<p>    Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />    panchamirtham ( a sweet recipe ) poured on the idol, one can <br />  extract <br />    the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />  becomes <br />    medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />  Navabashana <br />    idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />    abishegam ( pouring milk on the idol ) and panchamirtha <br />abishegam <br />  ( <br />    pouring panchamirtham on the idol ).</p>
<p>    His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />  Murugan <br />    pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />  samadhi <br />    stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />    Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. Actually <br />    Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />  Murugan <br />    Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />  entrance <br />    to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for <br />this <br />    great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />seen <br />  by <br />    his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at the <br />top <br />    of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, has <br />    overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to its <br />    popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after him <br />by <br />    sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal and <br />    private temple.</p>
<p>    During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />handed <br />    over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />    descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of this <br />  right <br />    by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to some <br />    annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, the <br />    arrow which symbolises Subramanya's victory over asuras. Right <br />to <br />  be <br />    buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some of <br />  them <br />    so chose.</p>

<p>      Bodhidharma (early 6th century CE) was the Buddhist monk <br />      traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little <br />  contemporary <br />      biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and <br />  subsequent <br />      accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts agree <br />  that <br />    he <br />      was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China and <br />      subsequently relocated northwards. Some claim Daruma <br />Bodhidharma <br />      (Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma) was the third child of the <br />      Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>      The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, which <br />    would <br />      make him an important influence on the martial arts of Asia in <br />      general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu to <br />      Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself <br />have <br />    been <br />      discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and <br />  Matsuda <br />      Ryuchi. </p>
<p>      Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts before <br />  they <br />      became two of the very first Shaolin monks…quot;years before <br />the <br />    arrival <br />      of Bodhidharma.The Taishō TripiṦamp;shy;aka documents <br />Sengchou's skill <br />    with <br />      the tin staff.</p>
<p>      Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />    intellectual <br />      and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary for <br />      enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment ultimately <br />  proved <br />      highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made Zen <br />    their <br />      way of life, following their encounter with the martial-arts-<br />      oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in the <br />    12th <br />      century. Yet in some versions of his legend, Bodhidharma's <br />focus <br />    was <br />      so single-minded during his nine years of meditation that his <br />  legs <br />      atrophied</p>

<p>  Nakkirar is of third sangam...as there is no proof for existence of<br />  first two sangams.....<br />  The three sangam concepts were only introduced by Nakkirar some <br />where<br />  between 6-9th century in his commentary to Iraivanar Agaporul....<br />  None of the literature before has any reference to three<br />  sangams...even in sangam literature there is no reference...</p>
<p>  There are reference in Jain sources that Jains started a Sangam for<br />  Tamil in Madurai...<br />  There are also reference here and there that there might have been<br />  committee of poets setup in and around Madurai ....<br />  So the possiblity is there was some kind of Academy of poets in<br />  Madurai and surely it was not as big and as organized as it is <br />quoted<br />  by Nakkirar(i.e the three sangam lasted for so many thousand years)</p>
<p>  No idea about Bogar as of now....But there are more myths than <br />facts<br />  concerned with Bogar.</p>

<p>    The words in tamil sound different from words in english...to me <br />    atleast. <br />    As with any words, it is in the eye of the beholder.<br />    I read it as a hardcore siva thathuvam and i would also deduce <br />the <br />    pariah / brahmin to iccha/kriya to be embedded inside the body.<br />    I am not to believe Sivavakiyar was into social reforms and <br />there is <br />    no reason to believe so. His words from other poems also seem <br />    pointing to a higher end of philosophy and siva thathuvams.<br />    --- etho yen sitrarivukku yettiyathu...</p>
<p>    Mr.Vairam, revisiting the older thread, has there been any study <br />of <br />    the St.Bogar and his uruva vazhipadu of Lord Muruga compared to <br />the <br />    1st sangam age? <br />    Any documentation of Bogar's time line to Nakeerar or pallava <br />    dynasty, i would be curious.</p>

<p>      Vairam,</p>
<p>      Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your <br />site, i <br />    was wondering about the <br />      intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about <br />    criticizing a community (atleast <br />      to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in <br />any <br />    of the sitthar songs</p>
<p>      First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />Second <br />    is just a comparison to <br />      say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />method <br />    of comparison.</p>
<p>      Can you post the full song and the translation from the book <br />are <br />    quoting this? Please post <br />      from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses <br />were <br />    criticizing brahmin <br />      dominated community?</p>
<p>      Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those <br />years. </p>

<p>        Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the <br />Brahmin<br />        dominated society and caste system of his period. I have <br />given two<br />        poems below which echo this feelings,</p>
<p>        In bricks and in granite,</p>

<p>        What does it mean - a Pariah woman?</p>
<p>        What does it mean - a Brahmin women?</p>
<p>        Is there any difference in flesh,</p>

        <p>I have not read the history or the book 'Smile of Murugan', but I <br />have written in one thread that Skanda, Karthikeya and Muruga are <br />different.<br />It is not a authentic 'copy book' view, but something that is derived <br />out of religious texts. <br />Facts can become myths over period of time, we cannot figure out <br />facts for myths. <br />Raja rajan can be a myth after 20,000 years from now.<br />Well, if Ishvaku is one, why not <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ?</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hello SPS Sir,<br />  I am totally accepting your views. My path is also learn true <br />history<br />  , but it is very very very small scale compared to yours. I loved<br />  history from my school. Have distinction of being in top .2% of CBSE<br />  exam writers in my 10th in History. But I never had habit of reading<br />  books.My sources were wikipedia and other mail fowards.<br />  I had gone across certain sources that Murugan and Skanda might be<br />  different gods earlier. In search for this, accidentally this year <br />in<br />  January I read Smile of Murugan.<br />  The book made me realise the following things:<br />  the richness of Tamil Sangam and following literatures.<br />  And mainly the need for critical study.</p>
<p>  Unlike Wikis which put forward one view, in critical study I saw<br />  various hypothesis and interpretation of different <br />scholars...rather a<br />  survey first and the author examining each work and telling his<br />  comments and putting forward his idea if he had...in way leaving the<br />  reader make use his brain and think which should be right based on<br />  various arguments...</p>
<p>  After reading that book, I stopped reading wiki's . Which ever <br />area  <br />  I wanted to study I just looked into bibliography in Smile of <br />Murugan<br />  and started applying the books in inter library loan.</p>
<p>  We should be indebted to works of A.K.Ramanujan,Gorge L Hart,Kamil<br />  Zvelebil in Tamil Studies.<br />  Especially Kamil Zvelebil for the sole reason for the simplicity of<br />  his language. Any common reader can understand what he says. </p>
<p>  One thing I have to say in this regard is(though some people might <br />not<br />  accept it)..there is some sort of bias knowingly or unknowingly <br />among<br />  the Indian Historians when it comes to religion and esp <br />Tamil/Sanskrit<br />  timelines and origins. Neelakanta Shastri is one of the greatest<br />  historians, but he too tends to say Sanksrit was the magic wand <br />which<br />  when hit the southern proto language created Tamil, which is totally<br />  unacceptable to any scholar who analyzed Tamil and its history.</p>
<p>  Next thing that is major problem to readers of history is that<br />  emotions, when have fixed notions on certain issues and when that is<br />  questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to be true...<br />  only when we are open to thoughts we can get real history..even if <br />it<br />  means somebody says 'people of your caste are murders'...its<br />  offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in it...if we close our <br />eyes<br />  we r not going to get the truth.</p>
<p>  True history can be found but it can never be discussed! ...<br />  politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are so many people to<br />  obstruct and stop it.</p>
<p>  I dont know what is the summary of this mail. But this is what I <br />feel<br />  about True History. Unless and until people leave out their emotions<br />  and prejudicial notions true history is very hard to come.</p>

<p>      The exact words of Kamil Zvelebil are as below<br />      "Civavakkiyar was one of the greatest rebels against the hindu<br />      establishment,particularly against the brahminic order of <br />things,he<br />      denounces the Brahmans,the authority of vedas and the aagamas,he<br />      condemns idol worship and temple cermonies.He is implacable <br />    opponent<br />      of caste system.He is against all forms of orthodoxy.He ignores <br />the<br />      division between the Saivites and Vaishnavites.Such rebellion <br />    against<br />      relegious orthodoxy and sacerdotalism was simply ignored by the<br />      established tradition,and his poems,numbering 527 stanzas,were <br />left<br />      out of Saiva canonical literature."</p>
<p>      And these are words of T.P.Meenakshisundaram from A history of <br />    Tamil<br />      Literature "There is forceful clarity,shocking us sometimes by <br />its<br />      forthright directness;he is not even afraid of using terms that <br />    prigs<br />      will call vulgar or obsene"</p>

<p>    DR.

<p>    About 5 years back, when we (Gokul - Kamal - Lanvaya - Ram - <br />Krupa <br />    and me among others ) listened to this WE did not understand the <br />    REAL MEANING of this.. </p>
<p>    Now at I realise that what we read or assume know is no were near <br />    Truth and hardly efforts are on in this Direction.</p>
<p>    I agree with you that THERE IS NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE IN THIS <br />    DIRECTION .. All are based on the Iraiyanar Agapporul Nool .. <br />which <br />    itself needs authentification ..</p>
<p>    1. Rift between the followers of Siva - Vishnu :: The recorded <br />    evidences point 11th / 12th Century .. Nothing prior to 10th <br />    Century.</p>
<p>    Therefore period of SIVA VACKIAR need to be ascertained based on <br />    cdertain dedtails. </p>
<p>    I will also post evidence that followers of VISHNU displayed <br />    VIBOOTHI in their Foreheads - during Bakthi period (8th Century ) <br />    and THIRUVOYMOZHI was hymned in Siva Temples during Naayanmar <br />period <br />    (same 7th / 8 th Century).</p>
<p>    There have been several " Idaicherugals " in History .. related <br />to <br />    traditions, literature and religion ..</p>
<p>    Dr. Kalaikkovan (and Dr. Nalini) - by virtue of their exposure to <br />    several facts - Truth - should have understood what is believed / <br />    discussed widely and what is the reality..</p>
<p>    To emlighten (history) infants like me, they revealed 5 years <br />back <br />    (some examples )::</p>
<p>    1. Thanjai Big Temple Kalasm shadow does fall on the ground ..</p>
<p>    2. Sigaram is not made of single stone of 80 tons as widely <br />    believed..</p>
<p>    3. Pillayarpatti is not Vinayaga Temple as widely believed .. it <br />is <br />    (Old) Siva Temple with Ayyanar in worship .. Sivalingam South <br />    facing..</p>
<p>    4. Pillayarpatti Kudavarai is NOT PALLAVA Kudavarai as widely <br />    believed (even it is postulated that Pallavas are pioneers on <br />    this).. but it is PANDYA KUDAVARAI .. ( with the technology <br />learnt <br />    through Jain sculptures !! )</p>
<p>    And advised us to look for True History ...</p>
<p>    and varalaaru.com was promoted in that direction .. !!</p>
<p>    That is why I defer to quote Wikipedia (Source Authorless - but <br />    collective and subjected to editing ) in discussions ..</p>

<p>      Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai<br />      The IAS saw its modest beginning in 1982 at Tiruvanmiyur, a <br />      spiritual centre hallowed in the ancient literary and cultural <br />      traditions of Asia.

<p>      Recently the Institute acquired two acres of choice land in <br />      Kanchipuram to launch a Bodhidharma Centre for Indian <br />Philosophy, <br />      named after the South Indian Buddhist monk who traveled to <br />China <br />    in <br />      the 8th century AD and started the Ch'an (Japanese Zen) school <br />of <br />      Mahayana Buddhism.</p>

<p>        could all this be true</p>
<p>        Kalangi Nathar was the guru of Bhogarnathar or Bhogar. <br />Kalangi <br />        Nathar was from Benaras.</p>
<p>        Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. <br />In <br />      China <br />        he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi <br />in <br />      China <br />        was the successor of Kalangi Nathar(Confucius).</p>
<p>        Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar (a mystic, yogi). <br />He <br />      was <br />        said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New <br />Age <br />        circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. Bhogar <br />    was <br />      a <br />        South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, <br />who <br />        became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. <br />In <br />        Bogar's Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />        preparations to his disciple Pullippani (so named as he is <br />      believed <br />        to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger) and at <br />    every <br />        stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani <br />must <br />      have <br />        been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a balaka.</p>
<p>        It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />      proceeded <br />        to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />      journey <br />        is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />        demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction <br />of <br />    the <br />        aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />    steam <br />        engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />    demonstrated <br />      by <br />        Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.</p>
<p>        Bogar's guru, Kālāngi Nāthar, is believed to be a Chinese <br />who <br />        attained siddhi in South India and thus became included among <br />    the <br />        Eighteen Siddhars.</p>
<p>        Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism (5th century B.C.) was the <br />first <br />        Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the <br />male <br />      Yang <br />        and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of <br />Shiva -</p>
<p>        Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept <br />was <br />      first <br />        revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is <br />as <br />    old <br />        as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 <br />B.C. <br />      Also <br />        alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. <br />135 <br />      and <br />        was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree <br />was <br />        enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by <br />the <br />        Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />    existing <br />        Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir <br />Refined <br />      in <br />        Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.</p>
<p>        The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter <br />    and <br />        the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about <br />    the <br />        same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went <br />under <br />      the <br />        name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi <br />Sriramadevar, <br />      who <br />        was known as Yacob in Arabia.</p>
<p>        This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the <br />concept <br />    of <br />        duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />      alchemy <br />        as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />      after <br />        Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher <br />    the <br />        emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy <br />have <br />        been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao <br />Tse <br />    by <br />        centuries.</p>
<p>        Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings <br />    will <br />        suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine <br />he <br />        used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing <br />these <br />    9 <br />        poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />      Master <br />        Medicine ( One medicine to cure all disease ). Thirumoolar <br />also <br />        discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />    With <br />        the consultation of Agasthiar ( Father of Ayurvedic Medicine) <br />    and <br />        other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons ( Nava Bashanam ) <br />and <br />      made <br />        the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />    currently <br />        worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near <br />Palani <br />        Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />      mixed <br />        the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.</p>
<p>        Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />        panchamirtham ( a sweet recipe ) poured on the idol, one can <br />      extract <br />        the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />      becomes <br />        medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />      Navabashana <br />        idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />        abishegam ( pouring milk on the idol ) and panchamirtha <br />    abishegam <br />      ( <br />        pouring panchamirtham on the idol ).</p>
<p>        His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />      Murugan <br />        pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />      samadhi <br />        stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />        Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. <br />Actually <br />        Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />      Murugan <br />        Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />      entrance <br />        to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for <br />    this <br />        great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />    seen <br />      by <br />        his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at <br />the <br />    top <br />        of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, <br />has <br />        overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to <br />its <br />        popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after <br />him <br />    by <br />        sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal <br />and <br />        private temple.</p>
<p>        During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />    handed <br />        over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />        descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of <br />this <br />      right <br />        by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to <br />some <br />        annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, <br />the <br />        arrow which symbolises Subramanya's victory over asuras. <br />Right <br />    to <br />      be <br />        buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some <br />of <br />      them <br />        so chose.</p>

<p>          Bodhidharma (early 6th century CE) was the Buddhist monk <br />          traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little <br />      contemporary <br />          biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and <br />      subsequent <br />          accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts <br />agree <br />      that <br />        he <br />          was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China and <br />          subsequently relocated northwards. Some claim Daruma <br />    Bodhidharma <br />          (Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma) was the third child of <br />the <br />          Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>          The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, <br />which <br />        would <br />          make him an important influence on the martial arts of Asia <br />in <br />          general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu <br />to <br />          Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself <br />    have <br />        been <br />          discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and <br />      Matsuda <br />          Ryuchi. </p>
<p>          Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts <br />before <br />      they <br />          became two of the very first Shaolin monks…quot;years <br />before <br />    the <br />        arrival <br />          of Bodhidharma.The Taishō TripiṦamp;shy;aka documents <br />    Sengchou's skill <br />        with <br />          the tin staff.</p>
<p>          Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />        intellectual <br />          and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary <br />for <br />          enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment ultimately <br />      proved <br />          highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made <br />Zen <br />        their <br />          way of life, following their encounter with the martial-<br />arts-<br />          oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in <br />the <br />        12th <br />          century. Yet in some versions of his legend, Bodhidharma's <br />    focus <br />        was <br />          so single-minded during his nine years of meditation that <br />his <br />      legs <br />          atrophied</p>

<p>      Nakkirar is of third sangam...as there is no proof for <br />existence of<br />      first two sangams.....<br />      The three sangam concepts were only introduced by Nakkirar some <br />    where<br />      between 6-9th century in his commentary to Iraivanar <br />Agaporul....<br />      None of the literature before has any reference to three<br />      sangams...even in sangam literature there is no reference...</p>
<p>      There are reference in Jain sources that Jains started a Sangam <br />for<br />      Tamil in Madurai...<br />      There are also reference here and there that there might have <br />been<br />      committee of poets setup in and around Madurai ....<br />      So the possiblity is there was some kind of Academy of poets in<br />      Madurai and surely it was not as big and as organized as it is <br />    quoted<br />      by Nakkirar(i.e the three sangam lasted for so many thousand <br />years)</p>
<p>      No idea about Bogar as of now....But there are more myths than <br />    facts<br />      concerned with Bogar.</p>

<p>          Vairam,</p>
<p>          Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your <br />    site, i <br />        was wondering about the <br />          intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about <br />        criticizing a community (atleast <br />          to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend <br />in <br />    any <br />        of the sitthar songs</p>
<p>          First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />    Second <br />        is just a comparison to <br />          say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />    method <br />        of comparison.</p>
<p>          Can you post the full song and the translation from the <br />book <br />    are <br />        quoting this? Please post <br />          from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these <br />verses <br />    were <br />        criticizing brahmin <br />          dominated community?</p>
<p>          Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those <br />    years. </p>

        <p>THanks SPS, i have seen this information before. however I am yet to <br />come aross concrete evidence to this details to show with people who <br />question authentcity of Bogar.</p>
<p>A few things are derived<br />a. Bogar lived prior to Thiruvalluvar<br />b. Uruva vazhipadu was available before thiruvalluvar.<br />c. what was thiruavinankudi temple - uruvam or aruvam ? if uruvam - <br />who built it and when?</p>

<p>    The exact words of Kamil Zvelebil are as below<br />    "Civavakkiyar was one of the greatest rebels against the hindu<br />    establishment,particularly against the brahminic order of <br />things,he<br />    denounces the Brahmans,the authority of vedas and the aagamas,he<br />    condemns idol worship and temple cermonies.He is implacable <br />  opponent<br />    of caste system.He is against all forms of orthodoxy.He ignores <br />the<br />    division between the Saivites and Vaishnavites.Such rebellion <br />  against<br />    relegious orthodoxy and sacerdotalism was simply ignored by the<br />    established tradition,and his poems,numbering 527 stanzas,were <br />left<br />    out of Saiva canonical literature."</p>
<p>    And these are words of T.P.Meenakshisundaram from A history of <br />  Tamil<br />    Literature "There is forceful clarity,shocking us sometimes by its<br />    forthright directness;he is not even afraid of using terms that <br />  prigs<br />    will call vulgar or obsene"</p>
<p>    And again words of Kamil V Z "Civavakkiyar may be considered as a<br />    landmark in the history of Tamil thought and writing."<br />  ===============================================  <br />  Dear Vairam, </p>
<p>  DR. KALAIKKOVAN, great son of Great Father Dr. Maa. <br />Raasamanickanar, <br />  who is an Authority in PALLAVAR VARALAARU ( Re Chozhar varalaru it <br />  is KAN Sastry, Re Pandiar Varalaaru it is Sadhasiva Pandarathar )- <br />  whose Centenary just concluded, used to say that we should put <br />  efforts in finding TRUE HISTORY .. !~</p>
<p>  About 5 years back, when we (Gokul - Kamal - Lanvaya - Ram - Krupa <br />  and me among others ) listened to this WE did not understand the <br />  REAL MEANING of this.. </p>
<p>  Now at I realise that what we read or assume know is no were near <br />  Truth and hardly efforts are on in this Direction.</p>
<p>  I agree with you that THERE IS NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE IN THIS <br />  DIRECTION .. All are based on the Iraiyanar Agapporul Nool .. <br />which <br />  itself needs authentification ..</p>
<p>  1. Rift between the followers of Siva - Vishnu :: The recorded <br />  evidences point 11th / 12th Century .. Nothing prior to 10th <br />  Century.</p>
<p>  Therefore period of SIVA VACKIAR need to be ascertained based on <br />  cdertain dedtails. </p>
<p>  I will also post evidence that followers of VISHNU displayed <br />  VIBOOTHI in their Foreheads - during Bakthi period (8th Century ) <br />  and THIRUVOYMOZHI was hymned in Siva Temples during Naayanmar <br />period <br />  (same 7th / 8 th Century).</p>
<p>  There have been several " Idaicherugals " in History .. related to <br />  traditions, literature and religion ..</p>
<p>  Dr. Kalaikkovan (and Dr. Nalini) - by virtue of their exposure to <br />  several facts - Truth - should have understood what is believed / <br />  discussed widely and what is the reality..</p>
<p>  To emlighten (history) infants like me, they revealed 5 years back <br />  (some examples )::</p>
<p>  1. Thanjai Big Temple Kalasm shadow does fall on the ground ..</p>
<p>  2. Sigaram is not made of single stone of 80 tons as widely <br />  believed..</p>
<p>  3. Pillayarpatti is not Vinayaga Temple as widely believed .. it is <br />  (Old) Siva Temple with Ayyanar in worship .. Sivalingam South <br />  facing..</p>
<p>  4. Pillayarpatti Kudavarai is NOT PALLAVA Kudavarai as widely <br />  believed (even it is postulated that Pallavas are pioneers on <br />  this).. but it is PANDYA KUDAVARAI .. ( with the technology learnt <br />  through Jain sculptures !! )</p>
<p>  And advised us to look for True History ...</p>
<p>  and varalaaru.com was promoted in that direction .. !!</p>
<p>  That is why I defer to quote Wikipedia (Source Authorless - but <br />  collective and subjected to editing ) in discussions ..</p>

<p>    Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai<br />    The IAS saw its modest beginning in 1982 at Tiruvanmiyur, a <br />    spiritual centre hallowed in the ancient literary and cultural <br />    traditions of Asia. Since then it has grown to become one of <br />  India's <br />    premier indological research and publication institutes.</p>
<p>    Recently the Institute acquired two acres of choice land in <br />    Kanchipuram to launch a Bodhidharma Centre for Indian Philosophy, <br />    named after the South Indian Buddhist monk who traveled to China <br />  in <br />    the 8th century AD and started the Ch'an (Japanese Zen) school of <br />    Mahayana Buddhism.</p>

<p>      could all this be true</p>
<p>      Kalangi Nathar was the guru of Bhogarnathar or Bhogar. Kalangi <br />      Nathar was from Benaras.</p>
<p>      Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. In <br />    China <br />      he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi in <br />    China <br />      was the successor of Kalangi Nathar(Confucius).</p>
<p>      Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar (a mystic, yogi). He <br />    was <br />      said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New Age <br />      circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. Bhogar <br />  was <br />    a <br />      South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, <br />who <br />      became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. In <br />      Bogar's Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />      preparations to his disciple Pullippani (so named as he is <br />    believed <br />      to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger) and at <br />  every <br />      stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani must <br />    have <br />      been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a balaka.</p>
<p>      It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />    proceeded <br />      to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />    journey <br />      is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />      demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction of <br />  the <br />      aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />  steam <br />      engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />  demonstrated <br />    by <br />      Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.</p>
<p>      Bogar's guru, Kālāngi Nāthar, is believed to be a Chinese <br />who <br />      attained siddhi in South India and thus became included among <br />  the <br />      Eighteen Siddhars.</p>
<p>      Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism (5th century B.C.) was the <br />first <br />      Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the male <br />    Yang <br />      and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of <br />Shiva -</p>
<p>      Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept was <br />    first <br />      revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is as <br />  old <br />      as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 B.C. <br />    Also <br />      alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. 135 <br />    and <br />      was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree was <br />      enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by <br />the <br />      Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />  existing <br />      Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir <br />Refined <br />    in <br />      Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.</p>
<p>      The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter <br />  and <br />      the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about <br />  the <br />      same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went <br />under <br />    the <br />      name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi <br />Sriramadevar, <br />    who <br />      was known as Yacob in Arabia.</p>
<p>      This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the concept <br />  of <br />      duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />    alchemy <br />      as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />    after <br />      Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher <br />  the <br />      emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy <br />have <br />      been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao Tse <br />  by <br />      centuries.</p>
<p>      Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings <br />  will <br />      suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine <br />he <br />      used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing <br />these <br />  9 <br />      poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />    Master <br />      Medicine ( One medicine to cure all disease ). Thirumoolar also <br />      discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />  With <br />      the consultation of Agasthiar ( Father of Ayurvedic Medicine) <br />  and <br />      other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons ( Nava Bashanam ) and <br />    made <br />      the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />  currently <br />      worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near <br />Palani <br />      Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />    mixed <br />      the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.</p>
<p>      Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />      panchamirtham ( a sweet recipe ) poured on the idol, one can <br />    extract <br />      the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />    becomes <br />      medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />    Navabashana <br />      idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />      abishegam ( pouring milk on the idol ) and panchamirtha <br />  abishegam <br />    ( <br />      pouring panchamirtham on the idol ).</p>
<p>      His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />    Murugan <br />      pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />    samadhi <br />      stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />      Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. <br />Actually <br />      Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />    Murugan <br />      Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />    entrance <br />      to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for <br />  this <br />      great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />  seen <br />    by <br />      his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at the <br />  top <br />      of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, has <br />      overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to its <br />      popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after him <br />  by <br />      sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal and <br />      private temple.</p>
<p>      During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />  handed <br />      over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />      descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of this <br />    right <br />      by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to some <br />      annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, the <br />      arrow which symbolises Subramanya's victory over asuras. Right <br />  to <br />    be <br />      buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some of <br />    them <br />      so chose.</p>

<p>        Bodhidharma (early 6th century CE) was the Buddhist monk <br />        traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little <br />    contemporary <br />        biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and <br />    subsequent <br />        accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts agree <br />    that <br />      he <br />        was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China and <br />        subsequently relocated northwards. Some claim Daruma <br />  Bodhidharma <br />        (Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma) was the third child of the <br />        Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>        The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, which <br />      would <br />        make him an important influence on the martial arts of Asia <br />in <br />        general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu to <br />        Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself <br />  have <br />      been <br />        discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and <br />    Matsuda <br />        Ryuchi. </p>
<p>        Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts before <br />    they <br />        became two of the very first Shaolin monks…quot;years <br />before <br />  the <br />      arrival <br />        of Bodhidharma.The Taishō TripiṦamp;shy;aka documents <br />  Sengchou's skill <br />      with <br />        the tin staff.</p>
<p>        Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />      intellectual <br />        and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary <br />for <br />        enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment ultimately <br />    proved <br />        highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made Zen <br />      their <br />        way of life, following their encounter with the martial-arts-<br />        oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in <br />the <br />      12th <br />        century. Yet in some versions of his legend, Bodhidharma's <br />  focus <br />      was <br />        so single-minded during his nine years of meditation that his <br />    legs <br />        atrophied</p>

<p>    Nakkirar is of third sangam...as there is no proof for existence <br />of<br />    first two sangams.....<br />    The three sangam concepts were only introduced by Nakkirar some <br />  where<br />    between 6-9th century in his commentary to Iraivanar Agaporul....<br />    None of the literature before has any reference to three<br />    sangams...even in sangam literature there is no reference...</p>
<p>    There are reference in Jain sources that Jains started a Sangam <br />for<br />    Tamil in Madurai...<br />    There are also reference here and there that there might have been<br />    committee of poets setup in and around Madurai ....<br />    So the possiblity is there was some kind of Academy of poets in<br />    Madurai and surely it was not as big and as organized as it is <br />  quoted<br />    by Nakkirar(i.e the three sangam lasted for so many thousand <br />years)</p>
<p>    No idea about Bogar as of now....But there are more myths than <br />  facts<br />    concerned with Bogar.</p>

<p>        Vairam,</p>
<p>        Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your <br />  site, i <br />      was wondering about the <br />        intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about <br />      criticizing a community (atleast <br />        to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in <br />  any <br />      of the sitthar songs</p>
<p>        First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />  Second <br />      is just a comparison to <br />        say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />  method <br />      of comparison.</p>
<p>        Can you post the full song and the translation from the book <br />  are <br />      quoting this? Please post <br />        from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses <br />  were <br />      criticizing brahmin <br />        dominated community?</p>
<p>        Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those <br />  years. </p>

          TRUE HISTORY        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>My two cents in this regard - <br />1 Is the historian (or anyone ) having inherent<br />bias/negativity and making generalistic comments on<br />some section of people or is he/she really<br />dispassionate? Calling all believers fools is a biased<br />negative stance, discusssing a poet's stance many<br />years ago is not negative, it is an objective view of<br />what that poet did, personally I find nothing<br />offensive in that at all.</p>
<p>2 I think we discussed this in the 'all Gods are one'<br />thread, or something related. There is a context to<br />what all poets/prophets/everyone says. When Jesus said<br />'I am the way' he meant spirituality as the single way<br />to liberation, it was his way of saying it as the<br />world was not so small in those days. What this poet<br />said about brahmins similarly is based on his<br />experience about some people who mis treated him and<br />others like him, not all - the times he lived in it<br />might have seemed like 'all'.</p>
<p>3 Lastly on self examination. What is our ties to this<br />'caste' related label and why? Is a software engineer<br />who knows two words of sanskrit somewhere really the<br />'brahmin' referred to in poems and scriptures? Is he<br />learned/qualified and in the same lines have the same<br />biases as they did? Probably not. Then what is there<br />to take offence? Personally to me nothing (I can<br />understand however others sensitivity in this regard<br />perhaps).</p>

<p>    Hello SPS Sir,<br />    I am totally accepting your views. My path is<br />  also learn true <br />  history<br />    , but it is very very very small scale compared to<br />  yours. I loved<br />    history from my school. Have distinction of being<br />  in top .2% of <br />  CBSE<br />    exam writers in my 10th in History. But I never<br />  had habit of <br />  reading<br />    books.My sources were wikipedia and other mail<br />  fowards.<br />    I had gone across certain sources that Murugan<br />  and Skanda might be<br />    different gods earlier. In search for this,<br />  accidentally this year <br />  in<br />    January I read Smile of Murugan.<br />    The book made me realise the following things:<br />    the richness of Tamil Sangam and following<br />  literatures.<br />    And mainly the need for critical study.</p>
<p>    Unlike Wikis which put forward one view, in<br />  critical study I saw<br />    various hypothesis and interpretation of different</p>
<p>  scholars...rather a<br />    survey first and the author examining each work<br />  and telling his<br />    comments and putting forward his idea if he<br />  had...in way leaving <br />  the<br />    reader make use his brain and think which should<br />  be right based on<br />    various arguments...</p>
<p>    After reading that book, I stopped reading wiki's<br />  . Which ever <br />  area <br />    I wanted to study I just looked into bibliography<br />  in Smile of <br />  Murugan<br />    and started applying the books in inter library<br />  loan.</p>
<p>    We should be indebted to works of<br />  A.K.Ramanujan,Gorge L Hart,Kamil<br />    Zvelebil in Tamil Studies.<br />    Especially Kamil Zvelebil for the sole reason for<br />  the simplicity of<br />    his language. Any common reader can understand<br />  what he says. </p>
<p>    One thing I have to say in this regard is(though<br />  some people might <br />  not<br />    accept it)..there is some sort of bias knowingly<br />  or unknowingly <br />  among<br />    the Indian Historians when it comes to religion<br />  and esp <br />  Tamil/Sanskrit<br />    timelines and origins. Neelakanta Shastri is one<br />  of the greatest<br />    historians, but he too tends to say Sanksrit was<br />  the magic wand <br />  which<br />    when hit the southern proto language created<br />  Tamil, which is <br />  totally<br />    unacceptable to any scholar who analyzed Tamil and<br />  its history.</p>
<p>    Next thing that is major problem to readers of<br />  history is that<br />    emotions, when have fixed notions on certain<br />  issues and when that <br />  is<br />    questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to<br />  be true...<br />    only when we are open to thoughts we can get real<br />  history..even if <br />  it<br />    means somebody says 'people of your caste are<br />  murders'...its<br />    offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in<br />  it...if we close our <br />  eyes<br />    we r not going to get the truth.</p>
<p>    True history can be found but it can never be<br />  discussed! ...<br />    politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are<br />  so many people to<br />    obstruct and stop it.</p>
<p>    I dont know what is the summary of this mail. But<br />  this is what I <br />  feel<br />    about True History. Unless and until people leave<br />  out their <br />  emotions<br />    and prejudicial notions true history is very hard<br />  to come.</p>

<p>        The exact words of Kamil Zvelebil are as below<br />        "Civavakkiyar was one of the greatest rebels<br />  against the hindu<br />        establishment,particularly against the<br />  brahminic order of <br />  things,he<br />        denounces the Brahmans,the authority of vedas<br />  and the <br />  aagamas,he<br />        condemns idol worship and temple cermonies.He<br />  is implacable <br />      opponent<br />        of caste system.He is against all forms of<br />  orthodoxy.He <br />  ignores the<br />        division between the Saivites and<br />  Vaishnavites.Such rebellion <br />      against<br />        relegious orthodoxy and sacerdotalism was<br />  simply ignored by the<br />        established tradition,and his poems,numbering<br />  527 stanzas,were <br />  left<br />        out of Saiva canonical literature."</p>
<p>        And these are words of T.P.Meenakshisundaram<br />  from A history of <br />      Tamil<br />        Literature "There is forceful clarity,shocking<br />  us sometimes by <br />  its<br />        forthright directness;he is not even afraid of<br />  using terms <br />  that <br />      prigs<br />        will call vulgar or obsene"</p>
<p>        And again words of Kamil V Z "Civavakkiyar may<br />  be considered <br />  as a<br />        landmark in the history of Tamil thought and<br />  writing."</p>

<p>Me also very much want Vedicists/Sanskritists to talk about this<br />topic.</p>
<p>Years ago, I have discussed Tamil parallels here stored in the<br />archives. The paLLippaTai temples of Pallavas, Cholas etc. with the<br />art historian, Mary Storm, UCLA and examples in South East Asia.<br />As you know Pallavan grantha script, which is used in Tamil country<br />for writing Sanskrit (Dr. James Nye, UChicago has created a web page<br />for displaying grantam script) is/was used in all of south east Asia<br />including Vietnam.<br /><a href="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE" title="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE">http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE</a>?<br />A2=ind9805&amp;L=indology&amp;P=R4978<br /><a href="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE" title="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE">http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE</a>?<br />A2=ind9805&amp;L=indology&amp;P=R11688<br /><a href="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE" title="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE">http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE</a>?<br />A2=ind9808&amp;L=indology&amp;P=R2642<br /><a href="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE" title="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE">http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE</a>?<br />A2=ind9805&amp;L=indology&amp;P=R2563<br /><a href="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE" title="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE">http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE</a>?<br />A2=ind9805&amp;L=indology&amp;P=R7873<br /><a href="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE" title="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE">http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE</a>?<br />A2=ind9805&amp;L=indology&amp;P=R7930<br /><a href="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE" title="http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE">http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE</a>?<br />A2=ind9810&amp;L=indology&amp;P=R11938<br />Let me cite few lines on the Devaraja issue in SEAsia from a personal<br />letter to me:<br />" [snip]<br />my SEA books are still in boxes in the garage, probably lost to <br />access<br />for months to come, BUT I will venture to say that the Devaraja issue<br />is fraught with controversy. I think the most interesting issues seem<br />to turn up in the Champa context, where there existed a very peculiar<br />amalgam of Tantric Saiva and Buddhist religion, but little has been<br />written about the Chams and most of that is in French, [snip]<br />There are some interesting links with the Pallavas, which you might<br />find pertinent. [...]"</p>
<p>A quick list is appended at the end from my biblio-notes which you <br />may<br />find interesting.</p>
<p>Kings and Gods are seen as one in many of S. Indian art:<br />Example 1) In the Chola painting (early 11th century) in Tanjore<br />temple, (long thought to be lost, but rediscovered by S. K.<br />Govindasamy of Annamalai univ., Chidambaram in 1930s) a youthful<br />majestic man with an aged munivar is seen. This, many authors claim<br />(eg., Nagasamy, or Jim Heitzman's book on Cholas (OUP) cover photo)<br />as Rajaraja I and his guru, KaruvUrt tEvar. BUT, this is only<br />part of the story. There are a total of 4 men standing (3 aged, one<br />young)! and a little far, there is Dakshinamurti sitting like<br />Ayyappan/Ayyanar with a yoga-paTTai. Dakshinamurti image is badly<br />damaged, For a sketch see C. Sivaramamurti, monumental Nataraja book.<br />Evidently, the devaraja concept is working here. Among the four <br />rishis<br />worshipping Dakshinamurti, (sanaka- aadi munivar), only sanatkumAran<br />is portrayed as young, and the rest are elderly rishis. The beautiful<br />idea is used by the master Chola painters: sanatkumAran-sanaka; also<br />simultaneously Rajarajan-KaruvUrttevar!<br />[I do not think anybody has described this info anywhere].</p>
<p>Dakshinamurti was present only in the old Tamizakam (= today's <br />Kearala<br />and TN, here I use tamizakam in the sense of Prof. P. Schalk's<br />publications). The Dakshinamurti in the Potiyil mountains is seen as<br />Avalokitesvara in Buddhist gaNDavyUhasUtram. There is a long and<br />ancient tradition among Saivaites that Tamil was taught by Shiva to<br />Agastya Malayamuni and among Tamil Buddhists that it was Avalokita <br />who<br />taught Tamil to Agastya at Potiyil. This earlier myth spills over <br />into<br />Sanskrit legends produced in the south that made Shaivaites claim <br />that<br />Shiva taught Sanskrit to Panini, and Buddhists on the contrary went <br />to<br />claim that it was really Avalokita who inspired Panini. Differing <br />from<br />M. Deshpande, Who inspired Panini?, JAOS paper (Nortwest<br />India/Afghanistan area was said to be the orgin of the Panini myths),<br />I wrote about South and the key role of Potiyil(Malaya/Potalaka)<br />in the creation of these legends about Panini and parallel ones for<br />Agastya. (1998 postings under the thread title: Where was PANini<br />inspired?)</p>
<p>Between Pandyan Madurai and Pallava/Cholan Chidambaram royal<br />competitions, the Dakshinamurti myth has played a major role. See<br />Dr. Palaniappan's essay from the Indology website:</p>
<p>a) Madurai and Chidambaram:<br />The Tamil Cities that Created Important Sanskrit Myths<br /><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/members/palaniappan-patanjali.html" title="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/members/palaniappan-patanjali.html">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/members/palaniappan-patanjali.html</a><br />b) Parvata, potiyil, and zrI-parvata<br />Some remarks by S. Palaniappan<br /><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/members/palaniappan-parvata.html" title="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/members/palaniappan-parvata.html">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/members/palaniappan-parvata.html</a></p>
<p>There is a century old important Indological quest to locate parvatam<br />mentioned in the shlokam of vAkyapadIyam 2.486. Anient Tamil texts<br />explicitly locate Parvatam as Potiyil(malayam), for example, in<br />Takkayaakap paraNi.</p>
<p>In the second millennium CE, Dakshinamurti travels North.<br />Abhivagupta's teacher praises him as Dakshinamurti, and<br />AdvaitavAdins use the DakshiNaamUrti theme.</p>
<p>Example 2:<br />-----------</p>
<p>I have already given an example of painting exhibiting Devaraja<br />phenomenon. Next is sculpture. Rajaraja I's famous and powerful son,<br />Rajendra Chozhan I has carved a big and beautuful relief sculpture at<br />GangaikoNDachOzapuram. This displays the ChaNDesa nAyanAr, who stays<br />outside all the Shiva sanctums in India and who cut his father down<br />with his axe. Shiva appears in the scene to revive the dead father,<br />and garlands the young ChaNDesar with his favorite flower garland <br />made<br />of ko_nRai flowers. In the Chola panel, Shiva, seated with Parvati, <br />is<br />seen garlanding the ChaNDesa Nayanar worshipping and thanking for the<br />highest honor that Shiva bestows. Here, ChaNDesar's face is said to <br />be<br />modeled after Rajendran I. (See his portrait sculpture in Gautam<br />Sarabhai collection). Again Devaraja concept: ChaNDesar/Rajendran.<br />Well, sort of.</p>
<p>S. Indian kings portrayed themselves only as Rishis/Nayanars etc.,<br />But Khmer kings went overboard and portrayed themslves as Vishnu, ...<br />Also, the famous "Smiling God" imagery seen in gopura towers of<br />Cambodia, has early precedents in Tamil literature and art.<br />[Will write on this some other time.]</p>
<p>I am almost positive that if successor states (like Vijayanagar,<br />Nayaks, Marathas) followed the earlier lead of seafaring in<br />sangam literature, and then Pallavas and Cholas built up<br />the Naval forces, India would not have been subdued by<br />Europe later.</p>

<p>Very Right and Correct observations. A true Open mind is a pre-<br />requisite for any historians. The Paradigms are only the killers in <br />this regard. One need to really dispassionate in this regard. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Hello SPS Sir,<br />  I am totally accepting your views. My path is also learn true <br />history<br />  , but it is very very very small scale compared to yours. I loved<br />  history from my school. Have distinction of being in top .2% of <br />CBSE<br />  exam writers in my 10th in History. But I never had habit of <br />reading<br />  books.My sources were wikipedia and other mail fowards.<br />  I had gone across certain sources that Murugan and Skanda might be<br />  different gods earlier. In search for this, accidentally this year <br />in<br />  January I read Smile of Murugan.<br />  The book made me realise the following things:<br />  the richness of Tamil Sangam and following literatures.<br />  And mainly the need for critical study.</p>
<p>  Unlike Wikis which put forward one view, in critical study I saw<br />  various hypothesis and interpretation of different <br />scholars...rather a<br />  survey first and the author examining each work and telling his<br />  comments and putting forward his idea if he had...in way leaving <br />the<br />  reader make use his brain and think which should be right based on<br />  various arguments...</p>
<p>  After reading that book, I stopped reading wiki's . Which ever <br />area  <br />  I wanted to study I just looked into bibliography in Smile of <br />Murugan<br />  and started applying the books in inter library loan.</p>
<p>  We should be indebted to works of A.K.Ramanujan,Gorge L Hart,Kamil<br />  Zvelebil in Tamil Studies.<br />  Especially Kamil Zvelebil for the sole reason for the simplicity of<br />  his language. Any common reader can understand what he says. </p>
<p>  One thing I have to say in this regard is(though some people might <br />not<br />  accept it)..there is some sort of bias knowingly or unknowingly <br />among<br />  the Indian Historians when it comes to religion and esp <br />Tamil/Sanskrit<br />  timelines and origins. Neelakanta Shastri is one of the greatest<br />  historians, but he too tends to say Sanksrit was the magic wand <br />which<br />  when hit the southern proto language created Tamil, which is <br />totally<br />  unacceptable to any scholar who analyzed Tamil and its history.</p>
<p>  Next thing that is major problem to readers of history is that<br />  emotions, when have fixed notions on certain issues and when that <br />is<br />  questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to be true...<br />  only when we are open to thoughts we can get real history..even if <br />it<br />  means somebody says 'people of your caste are murders'...its<br />  offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in it...if we close our <br />eyes<br />  we r not going to get the truth.</p>
<p>  True history can be found but it can never be discussed! ...<br />  politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are so many people to<br />  obstruct and stop it.</p>
<p>  I dont know what is the summary of this mail. But this is what I <br />feel<br />  about True History. Unless and until people leave out their <br />emotions<br />  and prejudicial notions true history is very hard to come.</p>

<p>      The exact words of Kamil Zvelebil are as below<br />      "Civavakkiyar was one of the greatest rebels against the hindu<br />      establishment,particularly against the brahminic order of <br />things,he<br />      denounces the Brahmans,the authority of vedas and the <br />aagamas,he<br />      condemns idol worship and temple cermonies.He is implacable <br />    opponent<br />      of caste system.He is against all forms of orthodoxy.He <br />ignores the<br />      division between the Saivites and Vaishnavites.Such rebellion <br />    against<br />      relegious orthodoxy and sacerdotalism was simply ignored by the<br />      established tradition,and his poems,numbering 527 stanzas,were <br />left<br />      out of Saiva canonical literature."</p>
<p>      And these are words of T.P.Meenakshisundaram from A history of <br />    Tamil<br />      Literature "There is forceful clarity,shocking us sometimes by <br />its<br />      forthright directness;he is not even afraid of using terms <br />that <br />    prigs<br />      will call vulgar or obsene"</p>
<p>      And again words of Kamil V Z "Civavakkiyar may be considered <br />as a<br />      landmark in the history of Tamil thought and writing."<br />    ===============================================  <br />    Dear Vairam, </p>
<p>    DR. KALAIKKOVAN, great son of Great Father Dr. Maa. <br />Raasamanickanar, <br />    who is an Authority in PALLAVAR VARALAARU ( Re Chozhar varalaru <br />it <br />    is KAN Sastry, Re Pandiar Varalaaru it is Sadhasiva <br />Pandarathar )- <br />    whose Centenary just concluded, used to say that we should put <br />    efforts in finding TRUE HISTORY .. !~</p>
<p>    About 5 years back, when we (Gokul - Kamal - Lanvaya - Ram - <br />Krupa <br />    and me among others ) listened to this WE did not understand the <br />    REAL MEANING of this.. </p>
<p>    Now at I realise that what we read or assume know is no were <br />near <br />    Truth and hardly efforts are on in this Direction.</p>
<p>    I agree with you that THERE IS NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE IN THIS <br />    DIRECTION .. All are based on the Iraiyanar Agapporul Nool .. <br />which <br />    itself needs authentification ..</p>
<p>    1. Rift between the followers of Siva - Vishnu :: The recorded <br />    evidences point 11th / 12th Century .. Nothing prior to 10th <br />    Century.</p>
<p>    Therefore period of SIVA VACKIAR need to be ascertained based on <br />    cdertain dedtails. </p>
<p>    I will also post evidence that followers of VISHNU displayed <br />    VIBOOTHI in their Foreheads - during Bakthi period (8th <br />Century ) <br />    and THIRUVOYMOZHI was hymned in Siva Temples during Naayanmar <br />period <br />    (same 7th / 8 th Century).</p>
<p>    There have been several " Idaicherugals " in History .. related <br />to <br />    traditions, literature and religion ..</p>
<p>    Dr. Kalaikkovan (and Dr. Nalini) - by virtue of their exposure <br />to <br />    several facts - Truth - should have understood what is <br />believed / <br />    discussed widely and what is the reality..</p>
<p>    To emlighten (history) infants like me, they revealed 5 years <br />back <br />    (some examples )::</p>
<p>    1. Thanjai Big Temple Kalasm shadow does fall on the ground ..</p>
<p>    2. Sigaram is not made of single stone of 80 tons as widely <br />    believed..</p>
<p>    3. Pillayarpatti is not Vinayaga Temple as widely believed .. it <br />is <br />    (Old) Siva Temple with Ayyanar in worship .. Sivalingam South <br />    facing..</p>
<p>    4. Pillayarpatti Kudavarai is NOT PALLAVA Kudavarai as widely <br />    believed (even it is postulated that Pallavas are pioneers on <br />    this).. but it is PANDYA KUDAVARAI .. ( with the technology <br />learnt <br />    through Jain sculptures !! )</p>
<p>    And advised us to look for True History ...</p>
<p>    and varalaaru.com was promoted in that direction .. !!</p>
<p>    That is why I defer to quote Wikipedia (Source Authorless - but <br />    collective and subjected to editing ) in discussions ..</p>

<p>        could all this be true</p>
<p>        Kalangi Nathar was the guru of Bhogarnathar or Bhogar. <br />Kalangi <br />        Nathar was from Benaras.</p>
<p>        Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. <br />In <br />      China <br />        he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi <br />in <br />      China <br />        was the successor of Kalangi Nathar(Confucius).</p>
<p>        Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar (a mystic, yogi). <br />He <br />      was <br />        said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New <br />Age <br />        circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. <br />Bhogar <br />    was <br />      a <br />        South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, <br />who <br />        became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. <br />In <br />        Bogar's Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />        preparations to his disciple Pullippani (so named as he is <br />      believed <br />        to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger) and at <br />    every <br />        stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani <br />must <br />      have <br />        been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a <br />balaka.</p>
<p>        It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />      proceeded <br />        to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />      journey <br />        is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />        demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction <br />of <br />    the <br />        aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />    steam <br />        engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />    demonstrated <br />      by <br />        Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.</p>
<p>        Bogar's guru, Kālāngi Nāthar, is believed to be a Chinese <br />who <br />        attained siddhi in South India and thus became included <br />among <br />    the <br />        Eighteen Siddhars.</p>
<p>        Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism (5th century B.C.) was the <br />first <br />        Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the <br />male <br />      Yang <br />        and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of <br />Shiva -</p>
<p>        Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept <br />was <br />      first <br />        revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is <br />as <br />    old <br />        as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 <br />B.C. <br />      Also <br />        alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. <br />135 <br />      and <br />        was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree <br />was <br />        enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by <br />the <br />        Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />    existing <br />        Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir <br />Refined <br />      in <br />        Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.</p>
<p>        The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of <br />matter <br />    and <br />        the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place <br />about <br />    the <br />        same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went <br />under <br />      the <br />        name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi <br />Sriramadevar, <br />      who <br />        was known as Yacob in Arabia.</p>
<p>        This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the <br />concept <br />    of <br />        duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />      alchemy <br />        as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four <br />centuries <br />      after <br />        Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice <br />aher <br />    the <br />        emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy <br />have <br />        been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao <br />Tse <br />    by <br />        centuries.</p>
<p>        Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human <br />beings <br />    will <br />        suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in <br />medicine he <br />        used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing <br />these <br />    9 <br />        poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />      Master <br />        Medicine ( One medicine to cure all disease ). Thirumoolar <br />also <br />        discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />    With <br />        the consultation of Agasthiar ( Father of Ayurvedic <br />Medicine) <br />    and <br />        other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons ( Nava Bashanam ) <br />and <br />      made <br />        the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />    currently <br />        worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near <br />Palani <br />        Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were <br />Bogar <br />      mixed <br />        the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.</p>
<p>        Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />        panchamirtham ( a sweet recipe ) poured on the idol, one can <br />      extract <br />        the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />      becomes <br />        medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />      Navabashana <br />        idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />        abishegam ( pouring milk on the idol ) and panchamirtha <br />    abishegam <br />      ( <br />        pouring panchamirtham on the idol ).</p>
<p>        His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />      Murugan <br />        pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />      samadhi <br />        stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. <br />Bogar <br />        Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. <br />Actually <br />        Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />      Murugan <br />        Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />      entrance <br />        to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship <br />for <br />    this <br />        great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />    seen <br />      by <br />        his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at <br />the <br />    top <br />        of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, <br />has <br />        overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to <br />its <br />        popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after <br />him <br />    by <br />        sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal <br />and <br />        private temple.</p>
<p>        During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />    handed <br />        over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests.

<p>          Bodhidharma (early 6th century CE) was the Buddhist monk <br />          traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little <br />      contemporary <br />          biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and <br />      subsequent <br />          accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts <br />agree <br />      that <br />        he <br />          was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China <br />and <br />          subsequently relocated northwards. Some claim Daruma <br />    Bodhidharma <br />          (Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma) was the third child of <br />the <br />          Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>          The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, <br />which <br />        would <br />          make him an important influence on the martial arts of <br />Asia in <br />          general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu <br />to <br />          Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself <br />    have <br />        been <br />          discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and <br />      Matsuda <br />          Ryuchi. </p>
<p>          Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts <br />before <br />      they <br />          became two of the very first Shaolin monks…quot;years <br />before <br />    the <br />        arrival <br />          of Bodhidharma.The Taishō TripiṦamp;shy;aka documents <br />    Sengchou's skill <br />        with <br />          the tin staff.</p>
<p>          Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />        intellectual <br />          and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary <br />for <br />          enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment <br />ultimately <br />      proved <br />          highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made <br />Zen <br />        their <br />          way of life, following their encounter with the martial-<br />arts-<br />          oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in <br />the <br />        12th <br />          century. Yet in some versions of his legend, Bodhidharma's <br />    focus <br />        was <br />          so single-minded during his nine years of meditation that <br />his <br />      legs <br />          atrophied</p>

<p>      Nakkirar is of third sangam...as there is no proof for <br />existence of<br />      first two sangams.....<br />      The three sangam concepts were only introduced by Nakkirar <br />some <br />    where<br />      between 6-9th century in his commentary to Iraivanar <br />Agaporul....<br />      None of the literature before has any reference to three<br />      sangams...even in sangam literature there is no reference...</p>
<p>      There are reference in Jain sources that Jains started a <br />Sangam for<br />      Tamil in Madurai...<br />      There are also reference here and there that there might have <br />been<br />      committee of poets setup in and around Madurai ....<br />      So the possiblity is there was some kind of Academy of poets in<br />      Madurai and surely it was not as big and as organized as it is <br />    quoted<br />      by Nakkirar(i.e the three sangam lasted for so many thousand <br />years)</p>
<p>      No idea about Bogar as of now....But there are more myths than <br />    facts<br />      concerned with Bogar.</p>

<p>        The words in tamil sound different from words in <br />english...to me <br />        atleast. <br />        As with any words, it is in the eye of the beholder.<br />        I read it as a hardcore siva thathuvam and i would also <br />deduce <br />    the <br />        pariah / brahmin to iccha/kriya to be embedded inside the <br />body.<br />        I am not to believe Sivavakiyar was into social reforms and <br />    there is <br />        no reason to believe so. His words from other poems also <br />seem <br />        pointing to a higher end of philosophy and siva thathuvams.<br />        --- etho yen sitrarivukku yettiyathu...</p>
<p>        Mr.Vairam, revisiting the older thread, has there been any <br />study <br />    of <br />        the St.Bogar and his uruva vazhipadu of Lord Muruga compared <br />to <br />    the <br />        1st sangam age? <br />        Any documentation of Bogar's time line to Nakeerar or <br />pallava <br />        dynasty, i would be curious.</p>

<p>          Vairam,</p>
<p>          Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your <br />    site, i <br />        was wondering about the <br />          intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about <br />        criticizing a community (atleast <br />          to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend <br />in <br />    any <br />        of the sitthar songs</p>
<p>          First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />    Second <br />        is just a comparison to <br />          say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />    method <br />        of comparison.</p>
<p>          Can you post the full song and the translation from the <br />book <br />    are <br />        quoting this? Please post <br />          from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these <br />verses <br />    were <br />        criticizing brahmin <br />          dominated community?</p>
<p>          Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those <br />    years. </p>

<p>            Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the <br />    Brahmin<br />            dominated society and caste system of his period. I have <br />    given two<br />            poems below which echo this feelings,</p>

          TRUE HISTORY        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hello SPS Sir,<br />I am totally accepting your views. My path is also learn true history<br />, but it is very very very small scale compared to yours. I loved<br />history from my school. Have distinction of being in top .2% of <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education" CBSE</acronym <br />exam writers in my 10th in History. But I never had habit of reading<br />books.My sources were wikipedia and other mail fowards.<br />I had gone across certain sources that Murugan and Skanda might be<br />different gods earlier. In search for this, accidentally this year in<br />January I read Smile of Murugan.<br />The book made me realise the following things:<br />the richness of Tamil Sangam and following literatures.<br />And mainly the need for critical study.</acronym></p>
<p>Unlike Wikis which put forward one view, in critical study I saw<br />various hypothesis and interpretation of different scholars...rather a<br />survey first and the author examining each work and telling his<br />comments and putting forward his idea if he had...in way leaving the<br />reader make use his brain and think which should be right based on<br />various arguments...</p>
<p>After reading that book, I stopped reading wiki's . Which ever area  <br />I wanted to study I just looked into bibliography in Smile of Murugan<br />and started applying the books in inter library loan.</p>
<p>We should be indebted to works of A.K.Ramanujan,Gorge L Hart,Kamil<br />Zvelebil in Tamil Studies.<br />Especially Kamil Zvelebil for the sole reason for the simplicity of<br />his language. Any common reader can understand what he says. </p>
<p>One thing I have to say in this regard is(though some people might not<br />accept it)..there is some sort of bias knowingly or unknowingly among<br />the Indian Historians when it comes to religion and esp Tamil/Sanskrit<br />timelines and origins. Neelakanta Shastri is one of the greatest<br />historians, but he too tends to say Sanksrit was the magic wand which<br />when hit the southern proto language created Tamil, which is totally<br />unacceptable to any scholar who analyzed Tamil and its history.</p>
<p>Next thing that is major problem to readers of history is that<br />emotions, when have fixed notions on certain issues and when that is<br />questioned we dont accept it even if it seems to be true...<br />only when we are open to thoughts we can get real history..even if it<br />means somebody says 'people of your caste are murders'...its<br />offensive..but there might be 1% of truth in it...if we close our eyes<br />we r not going to get the truth.</p>
<p>True history can be found but it can never be discussed! ...<br />politicians , religious heads etc etc...there are so many people to<br />obstruct and stop it.</p>
<p>I dont know what is the summary of this mail. But this is what I feel<br />about True History. Unless and until people leave out their emotions<br />and prejudicial notions true history is very hard to come.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Vairam</p>

<p>    The exact words of Kamil Zvelebil are as below<br />    "Civavakkiyar was one of the greatest rebels against the hindu<br />    establishment,particularly against the brahminic order of things,he<br />    denounces the Brahmans,the authority of vedas and the aagamas,he<br />    condemns idol worship and temple cermonies.He is implacable <br />  opponent<br />    of caste system.He is against all forms of orthodoxy.He ignores the<br />    division between the Saivites and Vaishnavites.Such rebellion <br />  against<br />    relegious orthodoxy and sacerdotalism was simply ignored by the<br />    established tradition,and his poems,numbering 527 stanzas,were left<br />    out of Saiva canonical literature."</p>
<p>    And these are words of T.P.Meenakshisundaram from A history of <br />  Tamil<br />    Literature "There is forceful clarity,shocking us sometimes by its<br />    forthright directness;he is not even afraid of using terms that <br />  prigs<br />    will call vulgar or obsene"</p>
<p>    And again words of Kamil V Z "Civavakkiyar may be considered as a<br />    landmark in the history of Tamil thought and writing."<br />  ===============================================  <br />  Dear Vairam, </p>
<p>  DR. KALAIKKOVAN, great son of Great Father Dr. Maa. Raasamanickanar, <br />  who is an Authority in PALLAVAR VARALAARU ( Re Chozhar varalaru it <br />  is KAN Sastry, Re Pandiar Varalaaru it is Sadhasiva Pandarathar )- <br />  whose Centenary just concluded, used to say that we should put <br />  efforts in finding TRUE HISTORY .. !~</p>
<p>  About 5 years back, when we (Gokul - Kamal - Lanvaya - Ram - Krupa <br />  and me among others ) listened to this WE did not understand the <br />  REAL MEANING of this.. </p>
<p>  Now at I realise that what we read or assume know is no were near <br />  Truth and hardly efforts are on in this Direction.</p>
<p>  I agree with you that THERE IS NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE IN THIS <br />  DIRECTION .. All are based on the Iraiyanar Agapporul Nool .. which <br />  itself needs authentification ..</p>
<p>  1. Rift between the followers of Siva - Vishnu :: The recorded <br />  evidences point 11th / 12th Century .. Nothing prior to 10th <br />  Century.</p>
<p>  Therefore period of SIVA VACKIAR need to be ascertained based on <br />  cdertain dedtails. </p>
<p>  I will also post evidence that followers of VISHNU displayed <br />  VIBOOTHI in their Foreheads - during Bakthi period (8th Century ) <br />  and THIRUVOYMOZHI was hymned in Siva Temples during Naayanmar period <br />  (same 7th / 8 th Century).</p>
<p>  There have been several " Idaicherugals " in History .. related to <br />  traditions, literature and religion ..</p>
<p>  Dr. Kalaikkovan (and Dr. Nalini) - by virtue of their exposure to <br />  several facts - Truth - should have understood what is believed / <br />  discussed widely and what is the reality..</p>
<p>  To emlighten (history) infants like me, they revealed 5 years back <br />  (some examples )::</p>
<p>  1. Thanjai Big Temple Kalasm shadow does fall on the ground ..</p>
<p>  2. Sigaram is not made of single stone of 80 tons as widely <br />  believed..</p>
<p>  3. Pillayarpatti is not Vinayaga Temple as widely believed .. it is <br />  (Old) Siva Temple with Ayyanar in worship .. Sivalingam South <br />  facing..</p>
<p>  4. Pillayarpatti Kudavarai is NOT PALLAVA Kudavarai as widely <br />  believed (even it is postulated that Pallavas are pioneers on <br />  this).. but it is PANDYA KUDAVARAI .. ( with the technology learnt <br />  through Jain sculptures !! )</p>
<p>  And advised us to look for True History ...</p>
<p>  and varalaaru.com was promoted in that direction .. !!</p>
<p>  That is why I defer to quote Wikipedia (Source Authorless - but <br />  collective and subjected to editing ) in discussions ..</p>

<p>      could all this be true</p>
<p>      Kalangi Nathar was the guru of Bhogarnathar or Bhogar. Kalangi <br />      Nathar was from Benaras.</p>
<p>      Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. In <br />    China <br />      he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi in <br />    China <br />      was the successor of Kalangi Nathar(Confucius).</p>
<p>      Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar (a mystic, yogi). He <br />    was <br />      said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New Age <br />      circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. Bhogar <br />  was <br />    a <br />      South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, who <br />      became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. In <br />      Bogar's Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />      preparations to his disciple Pullippani (so named as he is <br />    believed <br />      to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger) and at <br />  every <br />      stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani must <br />    have <br />      been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a balaka.</p>
<p>      It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />    proceeded <br />      to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />    journey <br />      is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />      demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction of <br />  the <br />      aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />  steam <br />      engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />  demonstrated <br />    by <br />      Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.</p>
<p>      Bogar's guru, Kālāngi Nāthar, is believed to be a Chinese who <br />      attained siddhi in South India and thus became included among <br />  the <br />      Eighteen Siddhars.</p>
<p>      Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism (5th century B.C.) was the first <br />      Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the male <br />    Yang <br />      and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of Shiva -</p>
<p>      Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept was <br />    first <br />      revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is as <br />  old <br />      as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 B.C. <br />    Also <br />      alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. 135 <br />    and <br />      was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree was <br />      enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by the <br />      Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />  existing <br />      Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir Refined <br />    in <br />      Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.</p>
<p>      The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter <br />  and <br />      the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about <br />  the <br />      same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went under <br />    the <br />      name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi Sriramadevar, <br />    who <br />      was known as Yacob in Arabia.</p>
<p>      This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the concept <br />  of <br />      duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />    alchemy <br />      as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />    after <br />      Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher <br />  the <br />      emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy have <br />      been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao Tse <br />  by <br />      centuries.</p>
<p>      Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings <br />  will <br />      suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine he <br />      used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing these <br />  9 <br />      poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />    Master <br />      Medicine ( One medicine to cure all disease ). Thirumoolar also <br />      discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />  With <br />      the consultation of Agasthiar ( Father of Ayurvedic Medicine) <br />  and <br />      other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons ( Nava Bashanam ) and <br />    made <br />      the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />  currently <br />      worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near Palani <br />      Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />    mixed <br />      the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.</p>
<p>      Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />      panchamirtham ( a sweet recipe ) poured on the idol, one can <br />    extract <br />      the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />    becomes <br />      medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />    Navabashana <br />      idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />      abishegam ( pouring milk on the idol ) and panchamirtha <br />  abishegam <br />    ( <br />      pouring panchamirtham on the idol ).</p>
<p>      His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />    Murugan <br />      pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />    samadhi <br />      stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />      Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. Actually <br />      Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />    Murugan <br />      Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />    entrance <br />      to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for <br />  this <br />      great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />  seen <br />    by <br />      his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at the <br />  top <br />      of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, has <br />      overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to its <br />      popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after him <br />  by <br />      sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal and <br />      private temple.</p>
<p>      During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />  handed <br />      over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />      descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of this <br />    right <br />      by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to some <br />      annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, the <br />      arrow which symbolises Subramanya's victory over asuras. Right <br />  to <br />    be <br />      buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some of <br />    them <br />      so chose.</p>

<p>        Bodhidharma (early 6th century CE) was the Buddhist monk <br />        traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little <br />    contemporary <br />        biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and <br />    subsequent <br />        accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts agree <br />    that <br />      he <br />        was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China and <br />        subsequently relocated northwards. Some claim Daruma <br />  Bodhidharma <br />        (Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma) was the third child of the <br />        Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>        The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, which <br />      would <br />        make him an important influence on the martial arts of Asia in <br />        general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu to <br />        Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself <br />  have <br />      been <br />        discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and <br />    Matsuda <br />        Ryuchi. </p>
<p>        Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts before <br />    they <br />        became two of the very first Shaolin monks…quot;years before <br />  the <br />      arrival <br />        of Bodhidharma.The Taishō TripiṦamp;shy;aka documents <br />  Sengchou's skill <br />      with <br />        the tin staff.</p>
<p>        Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />      intellectual <br />        and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary for <br />        enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment ultimately <br />    proved <br />        highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made Zen <br />      their <br />        way of life, following their encounter with the martial-arts-<br />        oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in the <br />      12th <br />        century. Yet in some versions of his legend, Bodhidharma's <br />  focus <br />      was <br />        so single-minded during his nine years of meditation that his <br />    legs <br />        atrophied</p>

<p>    Nakkirar is dated any where between 6-9 th century<br />    The most famous work of this Nakkirar is a commentary to Iraivanar<br />    Agaporul....since time period of Thirumurgatrupadai is also same...<br />    It is widely accepted that these two Nakkirars are same....<br />    There are also poets named Nakkirar in 11 th century and <br />  later...but<br />    their works are no way famous and no where near good...so they are<br />    believed to be poets with same names...and not the same poet....<br />    And there are at least 3 poets with name Nakkirar....<br />    similar trend is with Agathiyar and Auvaiyar....Atleast Auvaiyar <br />  was<br />    Sangam poet whose name was used by subsequent poets....but <br />  Agathiyar<br />    is total mythical character to bring in Aryan religion into Tamil's<br />    Divinity and his name is used from naadi edu to shidda medical <br />  text...</p>
<p>    Nakkirar is of third sangam...as there is no proof for existence of<br />    first two sangams.....<br />    The three sangam concepts were only introduced by Nakkirar some <br />  where<br />    between 6-9th century in his commentary to Iraivanar Agaporul....<br />    None of the literature before has any reference to three<br />    sangams...even in sangam literature there is no reference...</p>
<p>    There are reference in Jain sources that Jains started a Sangam for<br />    Tamil in Madurai...<br />    There are also reference here and there that there might have been<br />    committee of poets setup in and around Madurai ....<br />    So the possiblity is there was some kind of Academy of poets in<br />    Madurai and surely it was not as big and as organized as it is <br />  quoted<br />    by Nakkirar(i.e the three sangam lasted for so many thousand years)</p>
<p>    No idea about Bogar as of now....But there are more myths than <br />  facts<br />    concerned with Bogar.</p>

<p>        Vairam,</p>
<p>        Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your <br />  site, i <br />      was wondering about the <br />        intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about <br />      criticizing a community (atleast <br />        to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in <br />  any <br />      of the sitthar songs</p>
<p>        First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />  Second <br />      is just a comparison to <br />        say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />  method <br />      of comparison.</p>
<p>        Can you post the full song and the translation from the book <br />  are <br />      quoting this? Please post <br />        from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses <br />  were <br />      criticizing brahmin <br />        dominated community?</p>
<p>        Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those <br />  years. </p>

<p>          Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the <br />  Brahmin<br />          dominated society and caste system of his period. I have <br />  given two<br />          poems below which echo this feelings,</p>
<p>          In bricks and in granite,</p>
