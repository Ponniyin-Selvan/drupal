<p>I do not know such misconception prevails.</p>
<p>Am sure our dear Vairam will dispel this misconception.</p>
<p>This also provides us opportunity to write on our Tamil (language) Teacher.</p>
<p>Also other sources of learnt pleasant and cherishing Tamil..</p>
<p>firstly let us remember :: Tamil = amizhdhu = Nectar.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Friends,<br />  I did my plus two during 2004 academic year. If you leaf through the tamil thunaipadam book, it, you will find that there are stories by many great authors. Jeyakanthan, Asokamitran, Anna, are among them. I'm not very familiar with the works of those great men, so i can't pass judgement on their works.</p>
<p>  ?I had a brilliant tamil teacher who made even the abstruse 'cheyyul' (poetry) part sound like a modern masala movie. Our class would just roar with laughter every time she rendered her version of Cheevagan's leelais. (Cheevakachintamani :-)) </p>
<p>  Even she was unable to elicit even a single smile in the whole +2 academic year whenever she taught us thunaipadam. All stories were 'heavy', dripping with social message. You couldn't crack a joke without feeling guilty for having laughed. I'm not saying that a<br />  student shouldn't be socially aware, but one or two stories with a humorous theme is not much to ask, no?</p>
<p>  We get the impression that tamil is a 'serious' language. It is in the nature of a teenager to have fun. Yet the tamil state board books are full oflessons like, tamilin perumai, isai tamil, g.u.pope biography, etc., By the time i finished 10th, i was sick of the whole thing. I wanted to choose french, but the teacher convinced me to hold on. </p>
<p>  Why aren't we including stories by sujatha or kalki? Are they too 'cool' to be considered as serious tamil writers? Look, 'serious' writers are great. Fantastic men. but isn't there an imbalance on the non-humor side? Who is the new P.G.Wodehouse of Tamil? </p>
<p>  Look at english books. There are 'real' stories. Hemingway's fast narrative, Fischer's comments on Gandhi, Life of Bill Gates, Cup of Joy by mike gatting and so on. You can see the range of themes. Everyone has something.</p>
<p>  You<br />  can't preserve a language by shouting about its glory. You preserve it by making it relevant to the times and by helping us to understand the rangeof human emotions it can convey. </p>
<p>  If you speak english and talk about white superiority you are still a manwith a closed mind. If you talk tamil and you make people laugh or make them understand computers, you are still a modern man. Will the Education department realise that? </p>
<p>  I'm proud of the language, but can i convince a youngster who comes to mefor advice on whether to take french? I can only threaten him: Take tamil or else you won't get a government job, you won't be recognised as state first etc.,</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>my tamil teacher was cynical most of the times expectedly, since it was a cbse school and tamil as a second language has less than 15% takers.the bulkwent to french, sanskrit or hindi.</p>
<p>but then some how he left a spark.<br />i thanked him by name in my first novel kaviri mainthan.</p>
<p>also a man with immense memory.<br />when my son finished the same classes under him he used to say : dai unga appan maathiriyE unakkum la Zha lha varaathu pola</p>
<p>he remembered that i had a chronic problem with the las of tamil<br />( those in the group who proof read my book know of it) 22 years down the line.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>        and nothing can really replace a parent who inspires interest, forthat i am truly grateful and i know lot of people are.</p></blockquote>
<p>maloo's words should be etched in gold. i remember my father take me to theconnemara library when I was just six. it was like giving me the key to a new big world.that one act at such a tender age changed my life.</p>

          My Tamil Language Teacher        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I learnt tamil till my 12th standard (2001) in thiruvaiyaru. I have come<br />across tamil teachers of both the extremes..One who doesn't care about what<br />he/she is teaching and just wanted to teach it for the sake of it. One who<br />gets<br />into the bits and pieces and gets carried away by the sweetness in the<br />language...!</p>
<p>I still remember a class where he taught as Silapathigaram... that koval<br />entering the madurai and it was like the following<br />"Poruzhnthedutha aareyil nedungodi vaaral enbana pol marithu kai kaatta"<br />and our teacher stopped and explained that it is<br />tharkuripetra ani...! and explained that ani and then went on to give us<br />examples about different ani ilakkaanam and then<br />again said a lot of stories in Silapathikaaram etc., those classes were very<br />interesting for people who had interests in tamil language..!</p>
<p>But nevertheless of the quality of teaching students from our class never<br />had any sort of interests in tamil except a very few...<br />My father being a tamil major had a good collection of tamil books or<br />atleast reads very good books and hence I had access to<br />great writers like Kalki, Sujatha, Karunanidhi, Balakumaran, Devan etc., It<br />is just that access to those books that made me read more and more!</p>
<p>Now having settled far away from our mother land, I am again seeing parents<br />of two kinds...<br />One who doesn't care whether their kids speak our mother tongue or not, are<br />very proud that they are speaking<br />English in the accent where they are living and parents who make sure that<br />their kids speak, read and write<br />fluently in tamil. I think if the parents can facilitate the kids to read<br />those books or provide them access to some of the great books<br />then the next generation won't loose any of the great experience we all had<br />by reading tamil books.</p>

<p>  I learnt tamil in 1980s and some of my teachers were just ordinary people.<br />  By that i mean lower middle class, working women (since i went to a girls<br />  school) trying to make ends meet. My interest in tamil was fuelled mostlyby<br />  my mother, grandmother, uncle and the treasure of books we had at home. I<br />  still have the 'thunai paadam' books with short stories by a whole spectrum<br />  of writers - Jayakandan, Jagachirpiyan, Mu Varadarajanar, Vaasanthi,<br />  Sujatha, all of them. Yes we did have humor and all navarasams there<br />  although I can't say the teachers and majority of students enjoyed them. The<br />  upper middle class students were all about doing medicine or engineering and<br />  trying to make a living in those days(am sure it is not that different now<br />  from what this person says). 40 marks in tamil or any second language was<br />  enough for them. Literature and such were usually for lazy people who did<br />  not have to work for a living.</p>
<p>  That said about school - the hypocrisy in upper middle class culture as<br />  this gentleman points out is unmistakable. Most upper middle class kids<br />  almost regard it as fashion to speak only hindi, english and a foreign<br />  language on the side. I met a recent graduate from Berkeley from a tamil<br />  upper middle class family, his family was having a party in honor of his<br />  graduation and I casually asked him if he knew George C Hart the great tamil<br />  scholar was also at Berkely and his eyes popped out 'tamil scholar'?? there<br />  was an awkward silence and he said slowly 'er...no'. I dont' blame him for<br />  not knowing George Hart personally but the cynical reaction was interesting.</p>
<p>  Some things are true - if parents do not have interest it is extremely rare<br />  for kids to develop that, no matter what teachers or anyone else does. I<br />  inherited a whole treasury of hard bound english classics from someone whose<br />  dad forced him into burning them for his interest instead of doing<br />  engineering. The balance between interest and survival has to be taught, and<br />  nothing can really replace a parent who inspires interest, for that i am<br />  truly grateful and i know lot of people are.</p>

<p>      Friends,<br />      I did my plus two during 2004 academic year. If you leaf through the<br />  tamil thunaipadam book, it, you will find that there are stories by many<br />  great authors. Jeyakanthan, Asokamitran, Anna, are among them. I'm not very<br />  familiar with the works of those great men, so i can't pass judgement on<br />  their works.</p>
<p>      I had a brilliant tamil teacher who made even the abstruse 'cheyyul'<br />  (poetry) part sound like a modern masala movie. Our class would just roar<br />  with laughter every time she rendered her version of Cheevagan's leelais.<br />  (Cheevakachintamani :-))</p>
<p>      Even she was unable to elicit even a single smile in the whole +2<br />  academic year whenever she taught us thunaipadam. All stories were 'heavy',<br />  dripping with social message. You couldn't crack a joke without feeling<br />  guilty for having laughed. I'm not saying that a<br />      student shouldn't be socially aware, but one or two stories with a<br />  humorous theme is not much to ask, no?</p>
<p>      We get the impression that tamil is a 'serious' language. It is in the<br />  nature of a teenager to have fun. Yet the tamil state board books are full<br />  of lessons like, tamilin perumai, isai tamil, g.u.pope biography, etc., By<br />  the time i finished 10th, i was sick of the whole thing. I wanted to choose<br />  french, but the teacher convinced me to hold on.</p>
<p>      Why aren't we including stories by sujatha or kalki? Are they too<br />  'cool' to be considered as serious tamil writers? Look, 'serious' writers<br />  are great. Fantastic men. but isn't there an imbalance on the non-humor<br />  side? Who is the new P.G.Wodehouse of Tamil?</p>
<p>      Look at english books. There are 'real' stories. Hemingway's fast<br />  narrative, Fischer's comments on Gandhi, Life of Bill Gates, Cup of Joy by<br />  mike gatting and so on. You can see the range of themes. Everyone has<br />  something.</p>
<p>      You<br />      can't preserve a language by shouting about its glory. You preserve it<br />  by making it relevant to the times and by helping us to understand the range<br />  of human emotions it can convey.</p>
<p>      If you speak english and talk about white superiority you are still a<br />  man with a closed mind. If you talk tamil and you make people laugh or make<br />  them understand computers, you are still a modern man. Will the Education<br />  department realise that?</p>
<p>      I'm proud of the language, but can i convince a youngster who comes to<br />  me for advice on whether to take french? I can only threaten him: Take tamil<br />  or else you won't get a government job, you won't be recognised as state<br />  first etc.,</p>
