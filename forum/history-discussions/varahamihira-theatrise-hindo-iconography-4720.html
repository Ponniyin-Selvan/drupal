</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>varAhamihira was a medieval Hindu encyclopedist who lived in the <br />500s of the CE era. He may have descended from a family of <br />shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas, as suggested by the mihira epithet in his name <br />combined with varAha. This is also suggested by his tendencies for <br />solar-system worship which appears to have been a trait of the <br />shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas or Iranian Hindu brahmins. He covers an <br />extraordinary range of topics in his encyclopedic works ranging from <br />astronomy, mathematics, rituals, yavana jAtaka-s, sooth-saying of <br />various kinds, and worship of Hindu gods through idols. In the same <br />breadth he introduces some of the best know trigonometric formulae <br />like sinx^2 + cosx^2 = 1; the double angle expansions like cos2*x=1-<br />2*sinx^2 as well as the basics of Hindu iconography. Thus, it is not <br />suprising when we find trigonmetry mensuration and agamic issues <br />pertain to idols being linked even the works of the later day <br />nambutiri mathematician and tantric Chennas Narayanan Nambutiripad.</p>
<p>In his bR^ihat saMhitA he gives a succint section on construction of <br />icons of gods, which gives a good picture of what was the <br />iconographic situation around, 500-600 CE, the culmination of the <br />gupta period. Many of these topics are dealt with in great detail in <br />the purANas and Agamas of the various streams, but varAhamihira's <br />account appears to give a summary of what was popular, such that it <br />can be compared with surviving temples of the period, like the <br />glorious Udayagiri complex.</p>
<p>The deities who were iconographically depicted in varAhamihira's <br />times were: 1)rAma the son of dasharatha; 2) bali the son of <br />virochana, the asura. 3) viShNu with 8 arms etc 4) balabhadra or the <br />saMkarShaNa 5) sAmba 6) pradyumna 7) ekAnaMshA (3-7 appear to <br />represent a vaiShNava set parallel to the set expounded in the <br />iconographic chapters of the pA~ncharAtra tantras) 8)4-headed brahmA <br />9) kumAra or skanda 10) indra 11) rudra, holding uma by his side 12) <br />the buddha 13) the naked jain ascetic 14) sUrya 16) li~Nga 17) <br />revanta 18) yama 19) varuNa 20) kubera 21) vinAyaka 22) sapta-<br />mAtR^ika</p>
<p>Appended below are the relevant verses along with some notes and my <br />translation (the text follows the one provided freely by Indologist <br />Michio Yano and one published by obscure press in the drAviDa <br />country of which the title pages are worn off):</p>

<p>There are staunch followers of this Kali.</p>
<p>regards / sps</p></vj_episteme@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  varAhamihira was a medieval Hindu encyclopedist who lived in the <br />  500s of the CE era. He may have descended from a family of <br />  shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas, as suggested by the mihira epithet in his name <br />  combined with varAha. This is also suggested by his tendencies for <br />  solar-system worship which appears to have been a trait of the <br />  shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas or Iranian Hindu brahmins. He covers an <br />  extraordinary range of topics in his encyclopedic works ranging from <br />  astronomy, mathematics, rituals, yavana jAtaka-s, sooth-saying of <br />  various kinds, and worship of Hindu gods through idols. In the same <br />  breadth he introduces some of the best know trigonometric formulae <br />  like sinx^2 + cosx^2 = 1; the double angle expansions like cos2*x=1-<br />  2*sinx^2 as well as the basics of Hindu iconography. Thus, it is not <br />  suprising when we find trigonmetry mensuration and agamic issues <br />  pertain to idols being linked even the works of the later day <br />  nambutiri mathematician and tantric Chennas Narayanan Nambutiripad.</p>
<p>  In his bR^ihat saMhitA he gives a succint section on construction of <br />  icons of gods, which gives a good picture of what was the <br />  iconographic situation around, 500-600 CE, the culmination of the <br />  gupta period. Many of these topics are dealt with in great detail in <br />  the purANas and Agamas of the various streams, but varAhamihira's <br />  account appears to give a summary of what was popular, such that it <br />  can be compared with surviving temples of the period, like the <br />  glorious Udayagiri complex.</p>
<p>  The deities who were iconographically depicted in varAhamihira's <br />  times were: 1)rAma the son of dasharatha; 2) bali the son of <br />  virochana, the asura. 3) viShNu with 8 arms etc 4) balabhadra or the <br />  saMkarShaNa 5) sAmba 6) pradyumna 7) ekAnaMshA (3-7 appear to <br />  represent a vaiShNava set parallel to the set expounded in the <br />  iconographic chapters of the pA~ncharAtra tantras) 8)4-headed brahmA <br />  9) kumAra or skanda 10) indra 11) rudra, holding uma by his side 12) <br />  the buddha 13) the naked jain ascetic 14) sUrya 16) li~Nga 17) <br />  revanta 18) yama 19) varuNa 20) kubera 21) vinAyaka 22) sapta-<br />  mAtR^ika</p>
<p>  Appended below are the relevant verses along with some notes and my <br />  translation (the text follows the one provided freely by Indologist <br />  Michio Yano and one published by obscure press in the drAviDa <br />  country of which the title pages are worn off):</p>

          varAhamihira - theatrise on hindo iconography        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>this came to me as a forward from a friend...</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /><vj_episteme@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  varAhamihira was a medieval Hindu encyclopedist who lived in the <br />  500s of the CE era. He may have descended from a family of <br />  shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas, as suggested by the mihira epithet in his <br />name <br />  combined with varAha. This is also suggested by his tendencies for <br />  solar-system worship which appears to have been a trait of the <br />  shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas or Iranian Hindu brahmins. He covers an <br />  extraordinary range of topics in his encyclopedic works ranging <br />from <br />  astronomy, mathematics, rituals, yavana jAtaka-s, sooth-saying of <br />  various kinds, and worship of Hindu gods through idols. In the <br />same <br />  breadth he introduces some of the best know trigonometric formulae <br />  like sinx^2 + cosx^2 = 1; the double angle expansions like <br />cos2*x=1-<br />  2*sinx^2 as well as the basics of Hindu iconography. Thus, it is <br />not <br />  suprising when we find trigonmetry mensuration and agamic issues <br />  pertain to idols being linked even the works of the later day <br />  nambutiri mathematician and tantric Chennas Narayanan Nambutiripad.</p>
<p>  In his bR^ihat saMhitA he gives a succint section on construction <br />of <br />  icons of gods, which gives a good picture of what was the <br />  iconographic situation around, 500-600 CE, the culmination of the <br />  gupta period. Many of these topics are dealt with in great detail <br />in <br />  the purANas and Agamas of the various streams, but varAhamihira's <br />  account appears to give a summary of what was popular, such that <br />it <br />  can be compared with surviving temples of the period, like the <br />  glorious Udayagiri complex.</p>
<p>  The deities who were iconographically depicted in varAhamihira's <br />  times were: 1)rAma the son of dasharatha; 2) bali the son of <br />  virochana, the asura. 3) viShNu with 8 arms etc 4) balabhadra or <br />the <br />  saMkarShaNa 5) sAmba 6) pradyumna 7) ekAnaMshA (3-7 appear to <br />  represent a vaiShNava set parallel to the set expounded in the <br />  iconographic chapters of the pA~ncharAtra tantras) 8)4-headed <br />brahmA <br />  9) kumAra or skanda 10) indra 11) rudra, holding uma by his side <br />12) <br />  the buddha 13) the naked jain ascetic 14) sUrya 16) li~Nga 17) <br />  revanta 18) yama 19) varuNa 20) kubera 21) vinAyaka 22) sapta-<br />  mAtR^ika</p>
<p>  Appended below are the relevant verses along with some notes and <br />my <br />  translation (the text follows the one provided freely by <br />Indologist <br />  Michio Yano and one published by obscure press in the drAviDa <br />  country of which the title pages are worn off):</p>
