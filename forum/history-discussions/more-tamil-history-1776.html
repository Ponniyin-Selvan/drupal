<blockquote><p>  Dear SPS,</p>
<p>  That was a splendid thought :<br />============================================= </p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks Satish.. When Sen Kerry was conceding to Pres.Bush, his priority <br />should have been the Nation. The post - Head of the USA - cannot afford to <br />have been left undicided .. even for minutes... On the contrary Imagine our <br />Nation.. our polity would have tried every possibility to stop some one <br />ascending to top ..Where from such negatives has come ? Our great grand <br />parents did not have these. Majority of such qualities are migarated .. <br />That is why I mentioned of nativity...<br />==============================================</p>
<blockquote><p>  And Niranjan, we cannot say that during the periods mentioned by <br />  Priya, Tamil was in the Dark. <br />========================================</p></blockquote>
<p>Tamil was not in darkness.. Moghuls, British and then the political <br />movements kept us away from the True History .. Let us search and find and <br />share it with others ... Probably that is what we are doing now ..<br />===========================================<br />Priya,</p>
<blockquote><p>  Just not now, but even in your earlier mails, I can't stop wondering <br />  the abundant Historical Knowledge you possess. </p></blockquote>
<p>Probably you are echoing everyone's view .. Very much impresive..<br />=================================================================</p></satisharun@g...></p>
<blockquote><p>  I have a doubt for quite a long time. Can anyone tell me what are the <br />  present countries which our ancient history points to ..</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Sri..<br />===============================================</p>
<p>Whenver I visited Balaji Temple in Tirupathy, I used to stop at Ranga <br />Mandapam and pay my "manaseeka" respects to Ranga - who was kept there <br />during such turbulant times ... Sri Venugopalan (@ Pushpa Thangadurai) <br />should have been accredited suitably for writing elaborately on this <br />during our era through Dinamanikkadhir in the 80s .. as Thiruvarangan Ula <br />and Madhura Vijayam... Whenver I read of Ranga - the very thought is so <br />tasteful ... it is like tasting honey.. There was a debate : Who was <br />superior ? Andal or Seetha ? Seetha is Lord Rama's wife, who worshipped Sri <br />Ranganatha and since Andal eloped him inside the sanctum of Srirangam, it <br />was declared that Andal was superior to Seetha ! Vipranarayan - Sri <br />Ramanuja - Arayars - Nayaks and the staunch vaishnavites ... <br />There is nothing parallel to Srirangam in the entire Bhoologam - which is <br />located between Cauvery (Ponni) and Kollidam ...</p>
<p>May be our friends in <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a> can start serialising Tamil History<br />from sangam period to Nayaks / saraboji &amp; the alike .. Like prior to 2 AD - <br />Sangam : 2 - 5 Kalabras .. 6 Pallavas .. 7 - Pandyas / Mutharayas 8,9,10,11 <br />Chozhas 12 Later Pandyas 13 - 16, 16 - 18 AD ..</p>
<p>We can take up about one topic per week and criss-cross...</p>
<p>Best wishes .. sps</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  Its nice to share views and learn things, clarify our views etc. <br />  Initially when I joined<br />  this group a month back, I was quizzed a bit because only a couple of <br />  the members were writing. Now many have joined and pouring in their <br />  thoughts and I am happy that I am able to learn more daily and <br />  clarify things. As I wrote yesterday, only if we share our thoughts <br />  we can enrich our knowledge. It would be even great if others also <br />  start writing, because around 15 members out of 475...do you think <br />  its a good response....come on friends, shed your inhibitions and <br />  speak out. We have knowledgable people over here who can clarify our <br />  doubts, thoughts and views. Only thing which grows by sharing, is <br />  Knowledge. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />  Regards,<br />  Satish<br />===========================================</p></blockquote>
<p>That is a wonderful message from Dear Satish ... I have been voicing <br />concern only to avoid any division among us - who are otherwise bonded by <br />the powerful writings of Kalki - who was inspired by the Powerful Rule of <br />the Chozhas..and the great tradition of the Tamils...</p>
<p>I feel proud to be a Tamil and then an Indian ...</p>
<p>Let us try to bring back the Glories of yesterday into the Glories of <br />Tomorrow... Festival Greetings to everyone... fondly, sps</p></satisharun@g...></p>

          More on Tamil History        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Its nice to share views and learn things, clarify our views etc. <br />Initially when I joined<br />this group a month back, I was quizzed a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  because only a couple of <br />the members were writing. Now many have joined and pouring in their <br />thoughts and I am happy that I am able to learn more daily and <br />clarify things. As I wrote yesterday, only if we share our thoughts <br />we can enrich our knowledge. It would be even great if others also <br />start writing, because around 15 members out of 475...do you think <br />its a good response....come on friends, shed your inhibitions and <br />speak out. We have knowledgable people over here who can clarify our <br />doubts, thoughts and views. Only thing which grows by sharing, is <br />Knowledge. </acronym></p>
<p>GOod debate of cholas, EVR etc. Yes there are goods and bads in all. <br />Even I am not perfect, neither the others.I am not protesting anyone <br />or supporting anyone. Thought I have put a full stop yesterday <br />itself, but today i found many more mails. As a last mail on this <br />topic, I wish to share something. No one is totally right and no one <br />is totally wrong here. We are just sharing our views and hope the <br />maturity level is always high. No ones intention is to hurt others, <br />right...</p>
<p>Re.EVR, I am not touching much on this topic, because I have not read <br />much about his activities.All news I have are hearsay. But good that <br />everyone accepts that he has gone to extremes, which he could have <br />avoided. Yes the social reforsm made by him are highly comendable and <br />we should admit that.</p>
<p>Re true history creating hatred...I think vijay wrote on this. Yes <br />what you said is correct. Saying that so and so destroyed so many <br />temples, etc. surely creates hatred. I am not saying that these <br />should be taught at school. Its pity that when we say reading <br />history, it is confined only to school text books. What we read in <br />school is not the end of History..I think everyone will accept this <br />point. If that is so, then our group looses its purpose. why are we <br />discussing history here if we learn everything at school? </p>
<p>I only say that, when we talk about the greatness of only the muslim <br />rulers in our text book, the greatness of Hindu rulers should also be <br />inclued. I already wrote earlier that the syllubus starts with <br />ancient India at the 1st standard and ends with British India at <br />10std. So the students remember only the Moghul and British India and <br />no one knows about the greatness of other heros like <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym , <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym  or <br />Ashoka. As I said,the picture is painted as if the arts and <br />architecture flourished only during the Moghul rule. we all know its <br />not entirely true. Every king has contributed wisely for such purpose <br />and due respect should be given to them all. When you say Shah Jahan <br />built Taj Mahal, also tell that the Great <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  built the Big Temple. <br />group we all know how powerful the Chola Navy was. <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym  was able to <br />cris cross the Bay of Bengal humpteen number of times to capture the <br />countries overseas, which no Muslim Rulers have done. Why this is not <br />highlighted in the Indian History, where as Aurangzebs conquest till <br />Afghanistan alone is trumpeted.Its politics History to apease the <br />minorities.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Coming to the point of hatred..as you said, reading such things at a <br />mature age will do no harm. But its not available to the masses. If a <br />Ayodhya excavation occurs, if the US satellite shows Saraswathi river <br />bed, why dont the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  or the great historians probe and try to find <br />out the truth, instead of sticking to the old history told by the <br />westerners? If we think talking the truth will create hatered, then <br />the country will never live in peace. <br />Take the instance of Nazis homicide of the Jews. Even after 60 years, <br />everynow and then, the holocaust is remembered and reverberated <br />throughout the world. Everyday its discussed somewhere in the world. <br />Exhibitions are held to show the sufferings of the victims of the <br />Holocaust. Every single person who died in the gas chamber is a <br />hero/heroine. Their names are highlighted now and then. World class <br />magazines write about a simple person who died in the holocaust. Does <br />this create hatred against the Germans? No country or no community <br />has hatred against the Germans today. The Jews remember the holocaust <br />and showcause the world only becase, they dont want the fact to be <br />forgotten and no such Incident should occur in the furute. They dont <br />have a feeling of hatred against the Germans. On the other hand, <br />Germans remember the holocaust every now and then, because they <br />repent for what has been done and wanted to remind the world that <br />such things should not happen again. They have a sense of guilt which <br />they repent for. Jews and German are not fighting and killing each <br />other after the Holocaust.</acronym></p>
<p>But what happens in India..The Hindu Holocaust is much more higher <br />than the Jews holocaust. Then why no exhibition is conducted to <br />showcause that. Outside India, why even within India no one knows <br />this fact. Atrocities against the Hindus in kashmir valley and the <br />Islamic militancy is always on the rise only because like the <br />Germans, they dont have the sense of Guilt. Its not their fault. <br />Germans feel guilty because the Jews highlight the fact and the whole <br />world accepts it. Where as in India no one highlights the fact and so <br />there is no full stop to violence. Graham Stains and his sons..three <br />christian lives hold dear to all the politicians, but not even a <br />single politician or organisation in Inida,except Jayalalitha, <br />protested and condemned the Godhra Train carnage where 59 Hindus were <br />chared to death. Unless one community realises and repents for their <br />fault, there can be no peace. It holds good for Hindus, Christians or <br />muslims. But this doesnt happen in India. Whatever happen, the Hindus <br />are at the receivng end. If backlashing the upper caste and <br />sidelining them saying that in older days the uppercaste suppressed <br />the lower caste, and giving utmost attention to the lower caste is <br />justified (ofcourse its justfied and acceptable by all) then the same <br />holds good for stopping the Islamic fanatics by saying the fact that <br />Hindus have been suppressed for 10 decades. Why no one talks about <br />that? Because its votebank politics. This is what I mean by unbiased <br />open History.This will and can never happen in India.</p>
<p>'History Repeats Itself', but some history should not repeat itself <br />for which the unbiased History is a must. The main reason for Hindu <br />muslim divide in India, as far as I am concerned, the supression of <br />the facts. The north Indians have much more hatred against Muslims <br />than the south Indians. The riots mostly take place in North rather <br />than south. Why? Have anyone given a thought on this...because it was <br />they who have sufferred at the muslim hands for centuries while the <br />impact in the south is very less. Inspite of that when the political <br />parties and the government tries to appease the Muslim in the name of <br />minorities,and project a picture that the muslims are not safe in the <br />hands of the hindus, the hindus get agitated. Again its well proved <br />in Gujarat riots. Do you think, such a thing would have happened, if <br />immediate after the train carnage, all the political parties <br />protested and condemened the act and immediate action was taken <br />against the culprits? Today our great railway minister has ordered <br />for a second probe..are these justified. As long as the culprit dont <br />feel guilty of their act, India can never live in Peace. </p>
<p>History is the reflection of our culture. Its just like a mirror. <br />Unless we dont know how shappy we look, we cant clean ourselves and <br />for this unbiased History is a must. Thats what I mean to say.</p>
<p>Again, we see in this group itself that, when something wrong is said <br />about something, even without proper knowledge, there are many <br />comments saying, its the result of reading biased writings. But <br />whatever is being said and written about the uppercaste hindus, do <br />you think that its all unbiased. Only the attrocities done by them <br />are highlighted, and the too many goods done by them are suppressed. <br />Is it not biased writing? Why no one voice out for that?</p>
<p>Sorry for deviating the topic of the group. I said I am putting a <br />fullstop, yesterday itself, but things dont happen as we think. I am <br />just sharing my views with the group and I have no hatred, but <br />only 'adhangam' that our country is going to ruins. Hope you all will <br />understand my thought. </p>
<p>I know I am blunt at many instance, but thats my nature, weakness and <br />strength. Again I tell you, I write my views only to get more clarity <br />on what I think or feel. I dont claim whatever I say is correct. So <br />any criticism is most welcome so that I can enrich myself.</p>
<p>Sorry once again if I have written anything wrong. I am not for any <br />further discussion on this. Lets put a fullstop here, because its a <br />never ending topic. I need be we can create a seperate group for <br />this. hahah... just kidding. Lets get back to our business. </p>
<p>What about our Trip? I think if poeple let know the group about the <br />locations, then we can plan accordingly for aplace convinient to all, <br />so that the first trial trip becomes feasible.or if any place is ok <br />then I voice for Mahabalipuram. Any suggestions on how to proceed? </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

        <p>Dear Kamal,</p>
<p>I am in agreement with you..</p>
<p>Re Periyar EVR, even Rajaji and Mahaswamigal criticised only (Hindu) <br />Kadavul maruppu Iyakkam ... Other social reformations were need of the era. <br />Not that others did not care for reformations .. He was able to and <br />highlight also.. Rajram Mohan Roy, Thilakar and like, carried forward in <br />other parts of India ...</p>
<p>Incidentally, Arignar Anna has written more on Periyar marrying Maniammai .. <br />DMK was formed because of this single issue. DK never became the political <br />party.. it confined as a social reforming outfit..</p>
<p>There is difference in approach between Anna and Kalaignar ..<br />But what all of them had in common was : Before they criticised anything, <br />they went into the strengths of the Movement / Object which was <br />criticised ... </p>
<p>Those who were criticised, were not defending properly or could not <br />defend... (for lack of knowldge in their own faith)...</p>
<p>Recently when Ramagopalan presented Bagavath Gita to Kalaignar, he also <br />presented a review of Gita from the DK perspective written by <br />Dr.Veeramani...</p>
<p>How many of us have really read the materials of those whom we are <br />criticising now .... ? I do not want to get into such quick sand without <br />proper armoury ... and the platform ... different ..</p>
<p>Re descedents of Chozhas, about eight years back a Wedding Invitation of a <br />Mannargudi Family proclaimed them as descedents of " Perumbidugu <br />Mutharayas.. " .....</p>

        <p>Oops.. interesting tamil history thread got hijacked by Periyar <br />bashing...hmmm..</p>
<p>My 2 cents..<br />------------</p>
<p>There is a lot of blame to go around.. Instead of dwelling in the bad stuff <br />about the past why can't we move forward, think about how to improve the <br />present and future not repeating mistakes that we learned from the past..</p>
<p>Having said that let me try to defend Periyar...( Interestingly, I've just <br />defended Periyar in another thread in another group.. Maybe i should get <br />compensated by the DK folks.. :-) )</p>
<p>Periyar's self-respect movement is ALL about instilling self-confidence <br />and self-respect in the historically under-privileged people who have been <br />taught from birth that they are good for nothings.. have no intellect.. fit <br />for just physical stuff etc..etc...</p>
<p>People at that time were believing that god made them to be born into lower <br />caste families because of their bad deeds in previous generations and if <br />they perform their duty according to the dictated rules (such as don't <br />mingle with higher castes/ don't drink water from the same well/ don't <br />touch etc.. etc..) they might have a chance of being born into a higher <br />caste in their next generation.. As ridiculous as it may sound, that was <br />the scenario (it's unfortunate that even now ppl believe in this crap..) If <br />they fail to live according to the caste rules, god will punish those <br />folks.. </p>
<p>I believe that's the reason why Periyar attacked Hindu gods just to show to <br />the ppl, nothing will happen to them if they go against the rules and went <br />on to live happily till the ripe age of 96.. </p>
<p>I personally think some of his actions/comments are to the extreme, but his <br />intentions were noble.. The unfortunate result is that the non-brahmin <br />upper castes hijacked this self-respect movement and made it an anti-<br />brahmin movement..even though they've became the oppressing castes now.. </p>
<p>I really feel sad to discuss this again and again..<br />Caste system is an outdated system and the sooner we get rid of this, the <br />better..</p>

        <p>Oops.. interesting tamil history thread got hijacked by Periyar <br />bashing...hmmm..</p>
<p>My 2 cents..<br />------------</p>
<p>There is a lot of blame to go around.. Instead of dwelling in the bad stuff <br />about the past why can't we move forward, think about how to improve the <br />present and future not repeating mistakes that we learned from the past..</p>
<p>Having said that let me try to defend Periyar...( Interestingly, I've just <br />defended Periyar in another thread in another group.. Maybe i should get <br />compensated by the DK folks.. :-) )</p>
<p>Periyar's self-respect movement is ALL about instilling self-confidence <br />and self-respect in the historically under-privileged people who have been <br />taught from birth that they are good for nothings.. have no intellect.. fit <br />for just physical stuff etc..etc...</p>
<p>People at that time were believing that god made them to be born into lower <br />caste families because of their bad deeds in previous generations and if <br />they perform their duty according to the dictated rules (such as don't <br />mingle with higher castes/ don't drink water from the same well/ don't <br />touch etc.. etc..) they might have a chance of being born into a higher <br />caste in their next generation.. As ridiculous as it may sound, that was <br />the scenario (it's unfortunate that even now ppl believe in this crap..) If <br />they fail to live according to the caste rules, god will punish those <br />folks.. </p>
<p>I believe that's the reason why Periyar attacked Hindu gods just to show to <br />the ppl, nothing will happen to them if they go against the rules and went <br />on to live happily till the ripe age of 96.. </p>
<p>I personally think some of his actions/comments are to the extreme, but his <br />intentions were noble.. The unfortunate result is that the non-brahmin <br />upper castes hijacked this self-respect movement and made it an anti-<br />brahmin movement..even though they've became the oppressing castes now.. </p>

<p>By giving much biased worship to EVK, we forget services of Subramania siva, Swaminathan, Bharathiar, CHithambaram, Rajaji and Kalki and many more are there who sacrificed their life for this Tamil &amp; Tamil nadu. We easiliy avoiding/forget them. You know why? the media and mass are with them. They grow hatred. They divide the people for their political gain.</p>
<p>Sathishs views are understandablr. Its not kind of hatred. And in the same time you are also correct.</p>

<p>This is the real outcome of reading the biased history. People who followed<br />periyar wrote about him and people who were against periyar also wrote about<br />him. Haven't you heard 'Parisuththa aaviyil idli veguma?' , '786 allah-vin<br />kaidhi number-a?' , 'Kuzhandhai petra mary eppadi kanniyaaka irukka<br />mudiyum?' and all? Why do you see periyar as a 'Kadavul maruppaalar' alone?<br />Beyond that, he did lot of reforms which people refused to think at all in<br />those days. 'Pen kalvi', 'Vidhavai marumanam', 'Sikkana vaazhvu', 'Jaadhi<br />ozhippu', 'Kallunnaamai' etc. Unfortunately, some of his followers became<br />selfish. E.V.R was the chairman of Erode municipality and had to treat all<br />the people (irrespective of their belief on god) equal. That's why he served<br />as the dharmakartha of the temple during that period. It was not through out<br />his life. The person who became the chairman after periyar became the<br />dharmakartha of that temple.</p>
<p>Don't see DK movement through Kalaignar and other politicians alone. They<br />are not the only people in Dravidian movement. It is like saying 'Since<br />Premananda is not a good person, all the people in hindu religion is not<br />good'. DK which periyar started was just a social and non profit movement<br />and not the political party.<br />Do not decide anything based on the one sided information. 'Epporul yaar<br />yaar vaayk ketpinum apporul meypporul kaanpadhu arivu'. But, unfortunately,<br />we accept all the information as true which are favorable to us, without any<br />question.</p>

<p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her <br />country's true history. But not in India. Because as long as this so <br />called secular forces long for the minority votes, ture history will <br />never come to limelight. Secularism has lost its meaning in India. <br />Personally I would say India is not at all secular. Secularism, as we <br />all understand is treating all religions equal. But even today you <br />would have seen in news papers, that the political leaders went to <br />Iftar party conducted by the Muslims. Its nothing wrong in attending <br />religious parties. We too, get sweets and other eatables during <br />Ramzan from our Muslim neighbours. But, for instance take our <br />Kalaignar or any other DK descent...he criticises Bagavad Gita, <br />ridicules Hindus and Hindu beliefs and behaviour, talks ill about <br />Hindus, tells the world that 'Kadavalai kumbidugiravan kattumirandi' <br />and at the same time goes to Iftar Parties with the traditions <br />muslim 'kulla' on their Head. If they are really secular, they should <br />criticise the ills of all the religions, attend parties of all the <br />religions etc. Does this happen in our country?? The politicians fool <br />the people in the name of secularism. The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who <br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for <br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out <br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the <br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I <br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands <br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or <br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any <br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the <br />procession.</p>
<p>As long as such Politicians exist, India can never improve and never <br />can be secular and can never get its history right. I am not against <br />the minorities or I am not against the policies for them. But I want <br />it to be done for the actual cause of uplifting them and not as a <br />means of Political weapon. But unfortunately, the politicians take it <br />as a weapon against the masses. Why to go for the history of 1000 <br />years. We see distortion of history or historical facts in our <br />current lifetime itself. Its not only the politicians but also the <br />media which does this for their benefit. </p>
<p>All would have heard the news that, more than a year back, the <br />allahabad court ordered for an excavation by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  at the Ayodhya <br />site to see whether any Ram temple existed there or not. Daily news <br />were carried about the number of trenches dug and the work in <br />progress, but the findings were kept secret. The work went on for <br />nearly 2 months and after that no news was let out. It was suppressed <br />without any noise. Do you think if nothing had been found, the <br />politicians and the so called seculars would have kept quite. They <br />would have made a heu and cry saying that no Ram temple was there and <br />the excavation has proved it and would have lashed the BJP, Sang <br />Parivar, RSS etc. So any person with common sense can deduce that <br />something fishy had been found which they dont want to reveal. It <br />need not be seen in a religious perception. If something old has been <br />found, let it be even a mosque or anything, would we all appreciate a <br />historical monument? Even is nothing was there, why cant they make <br />the news transparent? </acronym></p>
<p>Another thing is the Gujarat riots..the media gave a great coverage <br />and showed the plight of the muslims who were victims of the riots. I <br />myself shed tears seeing those photos. But again, if 1000 people have <br />died, do you think all the 1000 were muslims. Its very much obvious <br />that when two groups class, both groups will have damages equally. If <br />1000 people died, atleast 400-500 should have been Hindus, right. <br />Then why didnt the media show the Hindus who sufferred. When Best <br />Bakery case is given so much Hype and Importance, why not the Godhra <br />Train carnage given its due importance. If 21 muslim people were <br />burnt alive in Best Bakerty,which is obviously attrocious and <br />barbaric, is it not attrocious and barbaric to burn 50 Hindus in a <br />train compartment? Why doesnt the mediat talk about this. Becuase the <br />politicians want vote, the media wants business and so create <br />sensational news(Remember James Bond move 'Tomorrow Never Dies') The <br />worst is, the main culprit in the Godhra carnage have escaped three <br />weeks back from the police custody. </p>
<p>The above two very recent incident shows how the fact are detoriated <br />which becomes History in the future. these Happen because, Hindus, by <br />the name of the Religion Sanathana Dharma, are very tolerant and <br />submissive. Hinduism is the only religion in the world, which doesnt <br />preche or convert orforce others to convert into Hinduism. (even <br />Buddist and Jains who are know for Non-violence, preche and convert)<br />What I mean to say is, the politicians takes Hindus for granted and <br />thats the main reason for detoriating the history. We can never get<br />unbiased, true and real history. Probably for our personal interest <br />we can probe and learn things. We have great scholars in this group <br />who are ready to publish their research materials and this way we can <br />learn our history to some extent and that too for our personal <br />satisfaction. We cant ever dream of reading the unbiased history in <br />the official published prints.</p>
<p>The article of Taj Mahal, which you have sent has been circulating <br />for years. I think this is a hoax. Probably, a hindu temple might <br />have existed at that location which shah jahan would have demolished, <br />but Taj as is cannot be a Hindu Temple. </p>
<p>Friends, I strogly belive that we can enrich our knowledge only by <br />sharing it. Only through discussion, we can learn more. So I write <br />based on my readings and thought process, and want to validat them. <br />So if you find anything wrong in whatever I write, I will be glad to <br />get corrected. This is not just for this mail, but for whatever I <br />write in this group.</p>

        <p>Dear Veena,</p>
<p>Thanks for the support. </p>
<p>As you said, this is a baseless claim. Most of the<br />Tamil pundits in schools and colleges are Brahmins<br />only in school.</p>
<p>Brahmins have done so much to Tamil literature and the<br />Tamil population expects them to continue to be so and<br />carry forward Tamil tradition and thinking.</p>

        <p>HI Satish,<br />Everyone has the right to know about the TRUE history and not distorted<br />figures. But at the same time, what we learn should not create hate<br />against others.<br />Agreed, Moghuls destroyed a lot of temples. At this age of 25+, when we<br />learn about it, we have enough wisdom to digest that fact. My blood<br />boiled when I read vanthaarkaL venRaakaL. But just imagine, at a tender<br />age of 11-15 when we are taught that Moghul rulers destroyed all<br />temples, DK movement unleashed a hate against Brahmins etc etc. won't it<br />create a feeling of hatred against them. It sows a seed of hate in your<br />heart, which can never be plucked out. And imagine you have a good<br />friend, who is a muslim and when you 2 study the same TRUE history in<br />school, won't you have a feeling of hatred against him as well.  <br />As such, the Indian community is divided, thanks to the bitter caste<br />politics and reservation. Do we want to create more division by<br />preaching the dark ages of the history.<br />Agreed literary works like kamba Ramayanam, Thiruvaasakaam, Thevaram<br />etc. were not given so much importance like the silappathikaaram etc.<br />But interested people can always learn that and do research on them.<br />There is no dearth of topic in history to be researched upon. <br />If we have learnt about Shah Jahan as a person, who built Taj Mahal, so<br />be it. Let us have good and optimistic opinion about him. Instead of<br />remembering him as a guy who never allowed construction of a single<br />temple across him empire. So whatever history we have learnt, let us say<br />is TRUE, if not COMPLETE.</p>

        <p>Dear Ananth,</p>
<p>If we start talking about the politicians and the so called <br />seculars,theres no end to it. We all know they are hipocrats. I <br />though that we are deviating from the topic and SPS has spelt it out. <br />So I stopped at that. What you say is 100% correct and I too voiced <br />the same concern. Though Kamal gave some instances of Periyars words <br />on Christians and Muslims, I think those are very limited. All <br />these 'seculars' target only the Hindus and especially the Brahmins. <br />Because again as I already said, Hindus are very tolerant and wont <br />protest for anything. I think lets put a fullstop here and get back <br />to our glorious past. Recent history is not glorious in any aspect.</p>
<p>Just another titbit..Dont know how far its true..I heard it from very <br />genuine people who are ardent tamil scholars or marabilakiya fanatics <br />and hence assume its true.....after 1975 or so (somewhere in the mid <br />of 70's) no Brahmin has got a Ph.D in Tamil, because no guide of <br />Tamil accepts a Brahmin student as a research scholar under him/her. <br />Courtesy, DK movement. They feel Brahmins dominate in all fields and <br />dont want them to shine in Tamil literature. Secularism at its best..<br />Please correct me if this information is wrong.</p>

        <p>Dear Kamal,</p>
<p>Can you please inform me the reason for the 'Poonool aruppu porattam' against the brahmins? Any genuine reasons for the same. I agree that Brahmins went too far as far as untouchability is concerned. But Bharathi himself being one, was against this. For others I can say its a case of sour grape and cheap publicity.</p>
<p>Leave the Brahmins, has all the other castes intermingled with each other. So whats the reason that only the Brahmins were targeted. Had it been any other caste, then probably that would have been the end of their life. Since it was Brahmins, they opted not for violence.</p>
<p>This is just like the concept of secularism of our so called leaders in our state.</p>

<p>This is the real outcome of reading the biased history. People who followed<br />periyar wrote about him and people who were against periyar also wrote about<br />him. Haven't you heard 'Parisuththa aaviyil idli veguma?' , '786 allah-vin<br />kaidhi number-a?' , 'Kuzhandhai petra mary eppadi kanniyaaka irukka<br />mudiyum?' and all? Why do you see periyar as a 'Kadavul maruppaalar' alone?<br />Beyond that, he did lot of reforms which people refused to think at all in<br />those days. 'Pen kalvi', 'Vidhavai marumanam', 'Sikkana vaazhvu', 'Jaadhi<br />ozhippu', 'Kallunnaamai' etc. Unfortunately, some of his followers became<br />selfish. E.V.R was the chairman of Erode municipality and had to treat all<br />the people (irrespective of their belief on god) equal. That's why he served<br />as the dharmakartha of the temple during that period. It was not through out<br />his life. The person who became the chairman after periyar became the<br />dharmakartha of that temple.</p>
<p>Don't see DK movement through Kalaignar and other politicians alone. They<br />are not the only people in Dravidian movement. It is like saying 'Since<br />Premananda is not a good person, all the people in hindu religion is not<br />good'. DK which periyar started was just a social and non profit movement<br />and not the political party.<br />Do not decide anything based on the one sided information. 'Epporul yaar<br />yaar vaayk ketpinum apporul meypporul kaanpadhu arivu'. But, unfortunately,<br />we accept all the information as true which are favorable to us, without any<br />question.</p>

<p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her <br />country's true history. But not in India. Because as long as this so <br />called secular forces long for the minority votes, ture history will <br />never come to limelight. Secularism has lost its meaning in India. <br />Personally I would say India is not at all secular. Secularism, as we <br />all understand is treating all religions equal. But even today you <br />would have seen in news papers, that the political leaders went to <br />Iftar party conducted by the Muslims. Its nothing wrong in attending <br />religious parties. We too, get sweets and other eatables during <br />Ramzan from our Muslim neighbours. But, for instance take our <br />Kalaignar or any other DK descent...he criticises Bagavad Gita, <br />ridicules Hindus and Hindu beliefs and behaviour, talks ill about <br />Hindus, tells the world that 'Kadavalai kumbidugiravan kattumirandi' <br />and at the same time goes to Iftar Parties with the traditions <br />muslim 'kulla' on their Head. If they are really secular, they should <br />criticise the ills of all the religions, attend parties of all the <br />religions etc. Does this happen in our country?? The politicians fool <br />the people in the name of secularism. The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who <br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for <br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out <br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the <br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I <br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands <br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or <br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any <br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the <br />procession.</p>
<p>As long as such Politicians exist, India can never improve and never <br />can be secular and can never get its history right. I am not against <br />the minorities or I am not against the policies for them. But I want <br />it to be done for the actual cause of uplifting them and not as a <br />means of Political weapon. But unfortunately, the politicians take it <br />as a weapon against the masses. Why to go for the history of 1000 <br />years. We see distortion of history or historical facts in our <br />current lifetime itself. Its not only the politicians but also the <br />media which does this for their benefit. </p>
<p>All would have heard the news that, more than a year back, the <br />allahabad court ordered for an excavation by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  at the Ayodhya <br />site to see whether any Ram temple existed there or not. Daily news <br />were carried about the number of trenches dug and the work in <br />progress, but the findings were kept secret. The work went on for <br />nearly 2 months and after that no news was let out. It was suppressed <br />without any noise. Do you think if nothing had been found, the <br />politicians and the so called seculars would have kept quite. They <br />would have made a heu and cry saying that no Ram temple was there and <br />the excavation has proved it and would have lashed the BJP, Sang <br />Parivar, RSS etc. So any person with common sense can deduce that <br />something fishy had been found which they dont want to reveal. It <br />need not be seen in a religious perception. If something old has been <br />found, let it be even a mosque or anything, would we all appreciate a <br />historical monument? Even is nothing was there, why cant they make <br />the news transparent? </acronym></p>
<p>Another thing is the Gujarat riots..the media gave a great coverage <br />and showed the plight of the muslims who were victims of the riots. I <br />myself shed tears seeing those photos. But again, if 1000 people have <br />died, do you think all the 1000 were muslims. Its very much obvious <br />that when two groups class, both groups will have damages equally. If <br />1000 people died, atleast 400-500 should have been Hindus, right. <br />Then why didnt the media show the Hindus who sufferred. When Best <br />Bakery case is given so much Hype and Importance, why not the Godhra <br />Train carnage given its due importance. If 21 muslim people were <br />burnt alive in Best Bakerty,which is obviously attrocious and <br />barbaric, is it not attrocious and barbaric to burn 50 Hindus in a <br />train compartment? Why doesnt the mediat talk about this. Becuase the <br />politicians want vote, the media wants business and so create <br />sensational news(Remember James Bond move 'Tomorrow Never Dies') The <br />worst is, the main culprit in the Godhra carnage have escaped three <br />weeks back from the police custody. </p>
<p>The above two very recent incident shows how the fact are detoriated <br />which becomes History in the future. these Happen because, Hindus, by <br />the name of the Religion Sanathana Dharma, are very tolerant and <br />submissive. Hinduism is the only religion in the world, which doesnt <br />preche or convert orforce others to convert into Hinduism. (even <br />Buddist and Jains who are know for Non-violence, preche and convert)<br />What I mean to say is, the politicians takes Hindus for granted and <br />thats the main reason for detoriating the history. We can never get<br />unbiased, true and real history. Probably for our personal interest <br />we can probe and learn things. We have great scholars in this group <br />who are ready to publish their research materials and this way we can <br />learn our history to some extent and that too for our personal <br />satisfaction. We cant ever dream of reading the unbiased history in <br />the official published prints.</p>
<p>The article of Taj Mahal, which you have sent has been circulating <br />for years. I think this is a hoax. Probably, a hindu temple might <br />have existed at that location which shah jahan would have demolished, <br />but Taj as is cannot be a Hindu Temple. </p>
<p>Friends, I strogly belive that we can enrich our knowledge only by <br />sharing it. Only through discussion, we can learn more. So I write <br />based on my readings and thought process, and want to validat them. <br />So if you find anything wrong in whatever I write, I will be glad to <br />get corrected. This is not just for this mail, but for whatever I <br />write in this group.</p>

        <p>Its true Kamal. But, you know if somebody worshiped like "the only great soul" who brought pahutharivu and vilippunarchi, then people who knows little more about history will definitely provoke that. </p>
<p>Points of Sathish are just like that. </p>
<p>By giving much biased worship to EVK, we forget services of Subramania siva, Swaminathan, Bharathiar, CHithambaram, Rajaji and Kalki and many more are there who sacrificed their life for this Tamil &amp; Tamil nadu. We easiliy avoiding/forget them. You know why? the media and mass are with them. They grow hatred. They divide the people for their political gain.</p>
<p>Sathishs views are understandablr. Its not kind of hatred. And in the same time you are also correct.</p>

E.V.R was the chairman of Erode municipality and had to treat all<br />the people (irrespective of their belief on god) equal. That's why he served<br />as the dharmakartha of the temple during that period. It was not through out<br />his life.

<p>Don't see DK movement through Kalaignar and other politicians alone. They<br />are not the only people in Dravidian movement.

<p>-----Original Message-----<br />From: SatishKumar Arunachalam [mailto:satisharun@gmail.com] <br />Sent: Monday, November 08, 2004 12:47 PM<br />To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: More on Tamil History</p>
<p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her <br />country's true history. But not in India. Because as long as this so <br />called secular forces long for the minority votes, ture history will <br />never come to limelight. Secularism has lost its meaning in India. <br />Personally I would say India is not at all secular. Secularism, as we <br />all understand is treating all religions equal. But even today you <br />would have seen in news papers, that the political leaders went to <br />Iftar party conducted by the Muslims. Its nothing wrong in attending <br />religious parties. We too, get sweets and other eatables during <br />Ramzan from our Muslim neighbours. But, for instance take our <br />Kalaignar or any other DK descent...he criticises Bagavad Gita, <br />ridicules Hindus and Hindu beliefs and behaviour, talks ill about <br />Hindus, tells the world that 'Kadavalai kumbidugiravan kattumirandi' <br />and at the same time goes to Iftar Parties with the traditions <br />muslim 'kulla' on their Head. If they are really secular, they should <br />criticise the ills of all the religions, attend parties of all the <br />religions etc. Does this happen in our country?? The politicians fool <br />the people in the name of secularism. The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who <br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for <br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out <br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the <br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I <br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands <br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or <br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any <br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the <br />procession.</p>
<p>As long as such Politicians exist, India can never improve and never <br />can be secular and can never get its history right. I am not against <br />the minorities or I am not against the policies for them. But I want <br />it to be done for the actual cause of uplifting them and not as a <br />means of Political weapon. But unfortunately, the politicians take it <br />as a weapon against the masses. Why to go for the history of 1000 <br />years. We see distortion of history or historical facts in our <br />current lifetime itself. Its not only the politicians but also the <br />media which does this for their benefit. </p>
<p>All would have heard the news that, more than a year back, the <br />allahabad court ordered for an excavation by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  at the Ayodhya <br />site to see whether any Ram temple existed there or not. Daily news <br />were carried about the number of trenches dug and the work in <br />progress, but the findings were kept secret. The work went on for <br />nearly 2 months and after that no news was let out. It was suppressed <br />without any noise. Do you think if nothing had been found, the <br />politicians and the so called seculars would have kept quite. They <br />would have made a heu and cry saying that no Ram temple was there and <br />the excavation has proved it and would have lashed the BJP, Sang <br />Parivar, RSS etc. So any person with common sense can deduce that <br />something fishy had been found which they dont want to reveal. It <br />need not be seen in a religious perception. If something old has been <br />found, let it be even a mosque or anything, would we all appreciate a <br />historical monument? Even is nothing was there, why cant they make <br />the news transparent? </acronym></p>
<p>Another thing is the Gujarat riots..the media gave a great coverage <br />and showed the plight of the muslims who were victims of the riots. I <br />myself shed tears seeing those photos. But again, if 1000 people have <br />died, do you think all the 1000 were muslims. Its very much obvious <br />that when two groups class, both groups will have damages equally. If <br />1000 people died, atleast 400-500 should have been Hindus, right. <br />Then why didnt the media show the Hindus who sufferred. When Best <br />Bakery case is given so much Hype and Importance, why not the Godhra <br />Train carnage given its due importance. If 21 muslim people were <br />burnt alive in Best Bakerty,which is obviously attrocious and <br />barbaric, is it not attrocious and barbaric to burn 50 Hindus in a <br />train compartment? Why doesnt the mediat talk about this. Becuase the <br />politicians want vote, the media wants business and so create <br />sensational news(Remember James Bond move 'Tomorrow Never Dies') The <br />worst is, the main culprit in the Godhra carnage have escaped three <br />weeks back from the police custody. </p>
<p>The above two very recent incident shows how the fact are detoriated <br />which becomes History in the future. these Happen because, Hindus, by <br />the name of the Religion Sanathana Dharma, are very tolerant and <br />submissive. Hinduism is the only religion in the world, which doesnt <br />preche or convert orforce others to convert into Hinduism. (even <br />Buddist and Jains who are know for Non-violence, preche and convert)<br />What I mean to say is, the politicians takes Hindus for granted and <br />thats the main reason for detoriating the history. We can never get<br />unbiased, true and real history. Probably for our personal interest <br />we can probe and learn things. We have great scholars in this group <br />who are ready to publish their research materials and this way we can <br />learn our history to some extent and that too for our personal <br />satisfaction. We cant ever dream of reading the unbiased history in <br />the official published prints.</p>
<p>The article of Taj Mahal, which you have sent has been circulating <br />for years. I think this is a hoax. Probably, a hindu temple might <br />have existed at that location which shah jahan would have demolished, <br />but Taj as is cannot be a Hindu Temple. </p>
<p>Friends, I strogly belive that we can enrich our knowledge only by <br />sharing it. Only through discussion, we can learn more. So I write <br />based on my readings and thought process, and want to validat them. <br />So if you find anything wrong in whatever I write, I will be glad to <br />get corrected. This is not just for this mail, but for whatever I <br />write in this group.</p>

<p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>Yes, its the basic right of any individual to know about his/her <br />country's true history. But not in India. Because as long as this so <br />called secular forces long for the minority votes, ture history will <br />never come to limelight. Secularism has lost its meaning in India. <br />Personally I would say India is not at all secular. Secularism, as we <br />all understand is treating all religions equal. But even today you <br />would have seen in news papers, that the political leaders went to <br />Iftar party conducted by the Muslims. Its nothing wrong in attending <br />religious parties. We too, get sweets and other eatables during <br />Ramzan from our Muslim neighbours. But, for instance take our <br />Kalaignar or any other DK descent...he criticises Bagavad Gita, <br />ridicules Hindus and Hindu beliefs and behaviour, talks ill about <br />Hindus, tells the world that 'Kadavalai kumbidugiravan kattumirandi' <br />and at the same time goes to Iftar Parties with the traditions <br />muslim 'kulla' on their Head. If they are really secular, they should <br />criticise the ills of all the religions, attend parties of all the <br />religions etc. Does this happen in our country?? The politicians fool <br />the people in the name of secularism. The great 'Periyar' E.V.R. who <br />started the DK and 'nathigam' movement, served as 'dharmakartha' for <br />a very big temple(i dont remember the name of the temple) through out <br />his life.. dont you think this is the height of Hipocracy.. and the <br />worst thing is people all followed and following him like crazy. I <br />have heard the E.V.R used to take processions with slipper garlands <br />around 'lord Rama's pictures and other Hindu Gods picutes. Will he or <br />any other politician can dare to do this with a jesus picture or any <br />Muslim Picture. If they did, they will not reach their home after the <br />procession.</p>
<p>As long as such Politicians exist, India can never improve and never <br />can be secular and can never get its history right. I am not against <br />the minorities or I am not against the policies for them. But I want <br />it to be done for the actual cause of uplifting them and not as a <br />means of Political weapon. But unfortunately, the politicians take it <br />as a weapon against the masses. Why to go for the history of 1000 <br />years. We see distortion of history or historical facts in our <br />current lifetime itself. Its not only the politicians but also the <br />media which does this for their benefit. </p>
<p>All would have heard the news that, more than a year back, the <br />allahabad court ordered for an excavation by the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  at the Ayodhya <br />site to see whether any Ram temple existed there or not. Daily news <br />were carried about the number of trenches dug and the work in <br />progress, but the findings were kept secret. The work went on for <br />nearly 2 months and after that no news was let out. It was suppressed <br />without any noise. Do you think if nothing had been found, the <br />politicians and the so called seculars would have kept quite. They <br />would have made a heu and cry saying that no Ram temple was there and <br />the excavation has proved it and would have lashed the BJP, Sang <br />Parivar, RSS etc. So any person with common sense can deduce that <br />something fishy had been found which they dont want to reveal. It <br />need not be seen in a religious perception. If something old has been <br />found, let it be even a mosque or anything, would we all appreciate a <br />historical monument? Even is nothing was there, why cant they make <br />the news transparent? </acronym></p>
<p>Another thing is the Gujarat riots..the media gave a great coverage <br />and showed the plight of the muslims who were victims of the riots. I <br />myself shed tears seeing those photos. But again, if 1000 people have <br />died, do you think all the 1000 were muslims. Its very much obvious <br />that when two groups class, both groups will have damages equally. If <br />1000 people died, atleast 400-500 should have been Hindus, right. <br />Then why didnt the media show the Hindus who sufferred. When Best <br />Bakery case is given so much Hype and Importance, why not the Godhra <br />Train carnage given its due importance. If 21 muslim people were <br />burnt alive in Best Bakerty,which is obviously attrocious and <br />barbaric, is it not attrocious and barbaric to burn 50 Hindus in a <br />train compartment? Why doesnt the mediat talk about this. Becuase the <br />politicians want vote, the media wants business and so create <br />sensational news(Remember James Bond move 'Tomorrow Never Dies') The <br />worst is, the main culprit in the Godhra carnage have escaped three <br />weeks back from the police custody. </p>
<p>The above two very recent incident shows how the fact are detoriated <br />which becomes History in the future. these Happen because, Hindus, by <br />the name of the Religion Sanathana Dharma, are very tolerant and <br />submissive. Hinduism is the only religion in the world, which doesnt <br />preche or convert orforce others to convert into Hinduism. (even <br />Buddist and Jains who are know for Non-violence, preche and convert)<br />What I mean to say is, the politicians takes Hindus for granted and <br />thats the main reason for detoriating the history. We can never get<br />unbiased, true and real history. Probably for our personal interest <br />we can probe and learn things. We have great scholars in this group <br />who are ready to publish their research materials and this way we can <br />learn our history to some extent and that too for our personal <br />satisfaction. We cant ever dream of reading the unbiased history in <br />the official published prints.</p>
<p>The article of Taj Mahal, which you have sent has been circulating <br />for years. I think this is a hoax. Probably, a hindu temple might <br />have existed at that location which shah jahan would have demolished, <br />but Taj as is cannot be a Hindu Temple. </p>
<p>Friends, I strogly belive that we can enrich our knowledge only by <br />sharing it. Only through discussion, we can learn more. So I write <br />based on my readings and thought process, and want to validat them. <br />So if you find anything wrong in whatever I write, I will be glad to <br />get corrected. This is not just for this mail, but for whatever I <br />write in this group.</p>

        <p>How to have true, unbiased, balanced and real history?<br />Is it not basic right of any individual?<br />But, is it practicable.</p>
<p>Following is an article i have come across is another example, I dont have any comment on this but its for information:</p>
<p>Real History of "Taj Mahal"<br />"The Moghul Emperor Shah Jahan in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal built the Taj Mahal. It was built in 22 years (1631 to 1653) by 20,000 artisans brought to India from all over the world! . Many people believe Ustad Isa of Iran designed it." This is what your guide possibly told you if you ever visited the Taj Mahal. This is the same story I read in my history book as a student.</p>
<blockquote><p>   NOW READ THIS.......<br />No one has ever challenged it except Prof. P. N. Oak, who believes the whole world has been duped. In his book Taj Mahal: The True Story, Oak says the Taj Mahal is not Queen Mumtaz's tomb but an ancient Hindu temple palace of Lord Shiva (then known as Tejo Mahalaya). In the course of his research Oak discovered that the Shiva temple palace was usurped by Shah Jahan from then Maharaja of Jaipur, Jai Singh. In his own court chronicle, Badshahnama, Shah Jahan admits that an exceptionally beautiful grand mansion in Agra was taken from Jai SIngh for Mumtaz's burial. The ex-Maharaja of Jaipur still retains in his secret collection two orders from Shah Jahan for surrendering the Taj building. Using captured temples and mansions, as a burial place ! for</p></blockquote>
<p>dead courtiers and royalty was a common practice among Muslim <br />rulers.<br />For example, Humayun,Akbar, Etmud-ud-Daula and Safdarjung are all <br />buried in such mansions. Oak's inquiries began with the name of Taj Mahal. He says the term "Mahal" has never been used for a building i n any Muslim countries from Afghanisthan to Algeria. "The unusual explanation that the term Taj Mahal derives from Mumtaz Mahal was illogical in atleast two respects.</p>
<p>Firstly, her name was never Mumtaz Mahal but Mumtaz-ul-Zamani," he <br />writes.<br />Secondly, one cannot omit the first three letters 'Mum' from a woman's name to derive the remainder as the name for the building."Taj Mahal, he claims, is a corrupt version of Tejo Mahalaya, or Lord Shiva's Palace. Oak also says the love story of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan is a fairy tale created by court sycophants, blundering historians and sloppy archaeologists. <br />Not a single royal chronicle of Shah Jahan's time corroborates the love <br />story.<br />Furthermore, Oak cites several documents suggesting the Taj Mahal <br />predates Shah Jahan's era, and was a temple dedicated to Shiva, worshipped by Rajputs of Agra city. For example, Prof. Marvin Miller of New York took a few samples from the riverside doorway of the Taj. Carbon dating tests revealed that the door was 300 years older than Shah Jahan. European traveler Johan Albert Mandelslo,who visited Agra in 1638 (only seven years after Mumtaz's death), describes the life of the city in his memoirs. But he makes no reference to the Taj Mahal being built. The writings of Peter Mundy, an English visitor to &lt; /SPAN Agra within a year of Mumtaz's death, also suggest the</p>
<blockquote><p>   Taj was a noteworthy building well before Shah Jahan's time.</p>
<p>   Prof. Oak points out a number of design and architectural <br />   inconsistencies</p>
<p>   that support the belief of the Taj Mahal being a typical Hindu <br />   temple rather</p>
<p>   than a mausoleum.Many rooms in the Taj ! Mahal have remained sealed <br />   since Shah</p>
<p>   Jahan's time and are still inaccessible to the public. Oak asserts <br />   they</p>
<p>   contain a headless statue of Lord Shiva and other objects commonly <br />   used for</p>
<p>   worship rituals in Hindu temples. Fearing political backlash, Indira</p>
<p>   Gandhi's government tried to have Prof. Oak's b ook withdrawn from <br />the</p>
<p>   bookstores, and threatened the Indian publisher of the first edition <br />   dire</p>
<p>   consequences. There is only one way to discredit or validate Oak's <br />   research.</p>
<p>   The current government should open the sealed rooms of the Taj Mahal <br />   under</p>
<p>   U.N. supervision, and let international experts investigate.</p>

Tipu Sultan is no great hero as we see <br />him nor he is not different from any other Muslim Ruler. (I am not <br />creting a thread on Relion or secularism or religions tolerance etc. <br />But just talking History). He has demolished thousands of Temples in <br />Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil nadu. While doing all these atrocities, <br />it seems one astrologer told him that he has done a great lot of sins <br />and if he touch Srirangapatnam temple, he is doomed. So to do <br />prayachitam for his sins he has to give irailis to Srirangapatnam <br />temple and thats why he left that temple alone. He has killed 10lakh <br />hindus in Kerala Tamil nadu border alone. Through out his province he <br />has killed millions of Hindus who refused to convert to Islam and has <br />forced millions to get converted to Isalm. Probably the story of him <br />eating koil prasadam is, pasi vandha pattum parandhu pogum. correcta.</p>
<p>Just another titbit. In the world arena people talk about the <br />homicide done by the German against the Jews. Till date lots of <br />exhibitions are conducted to remind us of the jews fate. You know one <br />thing, in the entire world, if any one community has underwent <br />harrassment from another country, it is the attrocities committed by <br />the Muslim Rulers against Hindus in the past 10 decades. The number <br />runs in Millions and may be even to Billion. In kashmir alone in just <br />one decade 4 million hindus have been killed. An entire community has <br />been erased from kashmir valley. The largest ever Homicide is the <br />killing of Hindus by the Muslim rulers in the past. But these facts <br />are not revelied because India is SECULAR..hahaha..and our <br />Governments will always encourage this because they are Secular...</p>
<p>Tipu fought against british not because he was a patriot and wanted <br />to Save india from foreign clutches. If he had thought so he would <br />not have joined hands with French to fight british. I think French <br />are also foreigners..haha..as any other king he wanted power and <br />wanted to rule his province and thats why he fought against the <br />British joining hands with French. If he was against foreigners <br />invasion, he would not have entertained French.</p>
<p>So we should not get carried away by what we read and hear as Indian <br />History. As SPS correctly said, we have to reinvent our History.</p>
<p>I think even before climbing the Sabari Malai, people go to vavar <br />masudhi at the foot hill..exceptions are always there my friend.</p>

So the temple authorities in those days, have opened a<br />  sannathi for him and the name "Anwar-ud-din" became Anavarathar.</p>
<p>  Also there is a place called 'Murugan kurichi' in Tirunelveli (it still<br />  exists). Not so many know that the idol of the "Tiruchendur murugan (I<br />  am not sure, whether it was the ursavar or the moolavar)" was kept there<br />  for some months by the dutch, when they tried to smuggle the statue to<br />  Holland. It so happened that the ship they carried the idol sunk in the<br />  sea and I believe the rest of story is known to all.</p>

<p>  Dear SPS,</p>
<p>  Yes you are correct in saying that we are influenced by the outsiders<br />  and got spoiled to the core. Politics in India is at its worst.<br />  Kamaraj and Kakkan are mere dreams for the present and forthcoming<br />  generations. Often I used to feel that Indians have adopted all the<br />  bad qualities from the west and neglected the goods in them. Where as<br />  the westerners are slowly attracted to the Indian culture and<br />  adopting our lifestyle. It wont be a surprise if after 100 years<br />  someone in US would have patented the ayurvedha, Yogasanas(to some<br />  extent Yoga is already patented in the US),siddha and copyrighted<br />  the vedas and upanishads as they have patented needm, basmathi etc.<br />  They are probing into each and every aspect of Indian history,<br />  tradition, culture,values etc. which really makes us Proud. But on<br />  the other hand we Indians take up their style and the youngsters are<br />  crazy of discotheques, bars,pubs, dating, divorce, etc etc..10 years<br />  back drinking was considered bad. Today smoking and drinking are not<br />  considered bad in our society. New terminologies have evolved for<br />  substanciating it - 'Socializing'..I am afraid where the country is<br />  going. I have taught on this and tried to find an answer many a<br />  times, but at last I was convinced with only one point which answers<br />  or rather was answered in great detail in our ancient scripts -<br />  "KALIYUGAM". Only this word convinces me for all the happenings.<br />  So if this is what the great lord, the master of PS, the master of<br />  all of us - brahadeeswara has written the screenplay as, no one can<br />  change it.</p>
<p>  I think I have deviated the topic a lot. Ok. Coming the Tiruvaranga<br />  Ula..yes its really touching to hear about these. Many a things are<br />  not know to all. Ranga was very much popular and being a kshetram<br />  this story is quite know to the masses. but there are several other<br />  such instances. People belonging to the North Arcot district might<br />  know this. My native, or rather my parents naitve is Vellore. Though<br />  our native is a kukgramam named Kadaladi near polur, we generally say<br />  vellore is our Native. Though I dont go there often, when I visit<br />  occasionally the 'Jalakanteswarar' temple, popularly know as 'Kotai<br />  Koil' because it is situated inside a big fort, I forget myself<br />  seeing the beauty of the lord Jalakanteswara. There is a big temple<br />  inside the fort premisis. The fort is a beauty to watch and I think<br />  its built by the vijayanagara kings.The sculptures are a boon to<br />  watch. The kalyana mandapam is so beautiful that the britishers<br />  wanted to take it to England and even marked every piece of the stone<br />  to disassemble and reassemble it. But fortunately the ship which was<br />  coming to India to take this masterpiece wrecked and drowned in the<br />  sea and hence the idea was discarded. Probably this could also be a<br />  place for us to visit.My father told me the story that, during the<br />  muslim invastion the muslim rulers planned to destroy the temple and<br />  fearing it the lingam was moved away from the temple. Its said that<br />  the lingam was protected by a family in Sathuvachari, near vellore<br />  for more than 150 years without anyone knowledge. In 1980's the then<br />  collected Belliappa wanted to bring the lingam back and after a great<br />  struggle the lingam was brought back to the temple and donations were<br />  collected to renovate the temple. Thus the lord was hiding without<br />  any pooja for nearly 150-200 years.</p>
<p>  Another incident in Dindigul,near Madurai. There is a famous Abirami<br />  Amman temple. The beauty is, this temple has two god and two<br />  godesses. Abirami amman and Padmagirisan, Gnanambikai and I forgot<br />  the lords name. Why because, it was originally Gnanmbikai and the<br />  lord and Abirami and Padmagirisan were at the fort atop the hill.<br />  Tipu sultan, as usual wanted to destroy the temple and pushed the<br />  lord and goddess from the hilltop. Since it has to be kept somewhere,<br />  the people protected it in the temple below and they got the<br />  prominance sidelining the original ambal and lord. So I think there<br />  are several stories around the country like this. Dadikombu near<br />  Dindigul is a visual treat. The perumal koil mandapam has life size<br />  sculptures(nearly a dozen) which needs 1000 eyes to watch. Such a<br />  beautiful and lively sirpams.</p>
<p>  The concept of organising Tamil Nadu history is a great one. I think<br />  the whole group will be interested to read that. Either it can be<br />  topic in the group mail,or an article in varalaaru.com. Again I get<br />  back to my earlier suggestion. Can we go from a macro view to the<br />  micro level. Meaning, instead of going by chronological order and<br />  going through the details at every stage, wont it be beneficial if we<br />  get a macro view of the history from the sangam period till date and<br />  then go through the details one by one. This is just my suggestion,<br />  becuase if we keep on repeating the same thing again and again, it<br />  becomes easier to remember, rather than reading one at a time. This<br />  is nothing but our Kalki's style. In PS he keeps on reapeating whose<br />  son is who and who did what on and off so that we get the perfect<br />  sequence. Its just a suggestion and if feasible, the researchers can<br />  think on it.</p>
<p>  I think I have taken up lot of your time and sorry for the same.<br />  Catch you all soon.<br />  Satish</p>

<p>Also there is a place called 'Murugan kurichi' in Tirunelveli (it still<br />exists). Not so many know that the idol of the "Tiruchendur murugan (I<br />am not sure, whether it was the ursavar or the moolavar)" was kept there<br />for some months by the dutch, when they tried to smuggle the statue to<br />Holland. It so happened that the ship they carried the idol sunk in the<br />sea and I believe the rest of story is known to all.</p>

<p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>Yes you are correct in saying that we are influenced by the outsiders <br />and got spoiled to the core. Politics in India is at its worst. <br />Kamaraj and Kakkan are mere dreams for the present and forthcoming <br />generations. Often I used to feel that Indians have adopted all the <br />bad qualities from the west and neglected the goods in them. Where as <br />the westerners are slowly attracted to the Indian culture and <br />adopting our lifestyle. It wont be a surprise if after 100 years <br />someone in US would have patented the ayurvedha, Yogasanas(to some <br />extent Yoga is already patented in the US),siddha and copyrighted  <br />the vedas and upanishads as they have patented needm, basmathi etc. <br />They are probing into each and every aspect of Indian history, <br />tradition, culture,values etc. which really makes us Proud. But on <br />the other hand we Indians take up their style and the youngsters are <br />crazy of discotheques, bars,pubs, dating, divorce, etc etc..10 years <br />back drinking was considered bad. Today smoking and drinking are not <br />considered bad in our society. New terminologies have evolved for <br />substanciating it - 'Socializing'..I am afraid where the country is <br />going. I have taught on this and tried to find an answer many a <br />times, but at last I was convinced with only one point which answers <br />or rather was answered in great detail in our ancient scripts -<br />"KALIYUGAM". Only this word convinces me for all the happenings. <br />So if this is what the great lord, the master of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , the master of <br />all of us - brahadeeswara has written the screenplay as, no one can <br />change it.</acronym></p>
<p>I think I have deviated the topic a lot. Ok. Coming the Tiruvaranga <br />Ula..yes its really touching to hear about these. Many a things are <br />not know to all. Ranga was very much popular and being a kshetram <br />this story is quite know to the masses. but there are several other <br />such instances. People belonging to the North Arcot district might <br />know this. My native, or rather my parents naitve is Vellore. Though <br />our native is a kukgramam named Kadaladi near polur, we generally say <br />vellore is our Native. Though I dont go there often, when I visit <br />occasionally the 'Jalakanteswarar' temple, popularly know as 'Kotai <br />Koil' because it is situated inside a big fort, I forget myself <br />seeing the beauty of the lord Jalakanteswara. There is a big temple <br />inside the fort premisis. The fort is a beauty to watch and I think <br />its built by the vijayanagara kings.The sculptures are a boon to <br />watch. The kalyana mandapam is so beautiful that the britishers <br />wanted to take it to England and even marked every piece of the stone <br />to disassemble and reassemble it. But fortunately the ship which was <br />coming to India to take this masterpiece wrecked and drowned in the <br />sea and hence the idea was discarded. Probably this could also be a <br />place for us to visit.My father told me the story that, during the <br />muslim invastion the muslim rulers planned to destroy the temple and <br />fearing it the lingam was moved away from the temple. Its said that <br />the lingam was protected by a family in Sathuvachari, near vellore <br />for more than 150 years without anyone knowledge. In 1980's the then <br />collected Belliappa wanted to bring the lingam back and after a great <br />struggle the lingam was brought back to the temple and donations were <br />collected to renovate the temple. Thus the lord was hiding without <br />any pooja for nearly 150-200 years. </p>
<p>Another incident in Dindigul,near Madurai. There is a famous Abirami <br />Amman temple. The beauty is, this temple has two god and two <br />godesses. Abirami amman and Padmagirisan, Gnanambikai and I forgot <br />the lords name. Why because, it was originally Gnanmbikai and the <br />lord and Abirami and Padmagirisan were at the fort atop the hill. <br />Tipu sultan, as usual wanted to destroy the temple and pushed the <br />lord and goddess from the hilltop. Since it has to be kept somewhere, <br />the people protected it in the temple below and they got the <br />prominance sidelining the original ambal and lord. So I think there <br />are several stories around the country like this. Dadikombu near <br />Dindigul is a visual treat. The perumal koil mandapam has life size <br />sculptures(nearly a dozen) which needs 1000 eyes to watch. Such a <br />beautiful and lively sirpams.</p>
<p>The concept of organising Tamil Nadu history is a great one. I think <br />the whole group will be interested to read that. Either it can be <br />topic in the group mail,or an article in varalaaru.com. Again I get <br />back to my earlier suggestion. Can we go from a macro view to the <br />micro level. Meaning, instead of going by chronological order and <br />going through the details at every stage, wont it be beneficial if we <br />get a macro view of the history from the sangam period till date and <br />then go through the details one by one. This is just my suggestion, <br />becuase if we keep on repeating the same thing again and again, it <br />becomes easier to remember, rather than reading one at a time. This <br />is nothing but our Kalki's style. In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  he keeps on reapeating whose <br />son is who and who did what on and off so that we get the perfect <br />sequence. Its just a suggestion and if feasible, the researchers can <br />think on it.</acronym></p>
<p>I think I have taken up lot of your time and sorry for the same. <br />Catch you all soon.<br />Satish</p>

<p>Thanks to Sri..<br />===============================================</p>
<p>Whenver I visited Balaji Temple in Tirupathy, I used to stop at Ranga <br />Mandapam and pay my "manaseeka" respects to Ranga - who was kept there <br />during such turbulant times ... Sri Venugopalan (@ Pushpa Thangadurai) <br />should have been accredited suitably for writing elaborately on this <br />during our era through Dinamanikkadhir in the 80s .. as Thiruvarangan Ula <br />and Madhura Vijayam... Whenver I read of Ranga - the very thought is so <br />tasteful ... it is like tasting honey.. There was a debate : Who was <br />superior ? Andal or Seetha ? Seetha is Lord Rama's wife, who worshipped Sri <br />Ranganatha and since Andal eloped him inside the sanctum of Srirangam, it <br />was declared that Andal was superior to Seetha ! Vipranarayan - Sri <br />Ramanuja - Arayars - Nayaks and the staunch vaishnavites ... <br />There is nothing parallel to Srirangam in the entire Bhoologam - which is <br />located between Cauvery (Ponni) and Kollidam ...</p>
<p>May be our friends in <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a> can start serialising Tamil History<br />from sangam period to Nayaks / saraboji &amp; the alike .. Like prior to 2 AD - <br />Sangam : 2 - 5 Kalabras .. 6 Pallavas .. 7 - Pandyas / Mutharayas 8,9,10,11 <br />Chozhas 12 Later Pandyas 13 - 16, 16 - 18 AD ..</p>
<p>We can take up about one topic per week and criss-cross...</p>
