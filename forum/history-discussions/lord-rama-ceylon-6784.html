<p>Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>I have also read that Indian peninsula was also part of Africa millions <br />of years back... and comparisons between ancient Nagas and Negros.</p>
<p>Though our Dear Sathish takes exception, the storyline of Ramayana is <br />zeroed to 5500 AD ... say 7500 years back .. okay.. let us assume 10000 <br />years back !</p>

<p>Fantanstic!? The analysis and discussion is very interesting.? I would suggest you to take into account the four (?) yugaas - Kritha Yugam, Dhrethaa Yugam, Dhwabhara Yugam and Kali Yugam - which has some significance? in calculation of years.? It may be of help and the discussion may be further interesting.?? </p>
<p>Some more learned persons might help.</p>
<p>Wishing happy new year to every one,</p>
<p>With kind regards,</p>

<p>  I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar was <br />a<br />  part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. It<br />  is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>  You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />  landscapes etc. </p>
<p>  The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />  kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />  earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate movement. </p>
<p>  Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over period <br />of<br />  time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was dissolved<br />  into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of <br />Iravana.</p>

<p>          There have been many studies concluding that the large <br />landmass <br />      broke <br />          into smaller islands. </p>
<p>          The last of the islands was to have submerged in the 5500's <br />      (though <br />          the prime mass was to have sunk in 16000 BC). </p>
<p>          The belief is that the current madurai was constructed as <br />the <br />      pandya <br />          king was instructed by the elements of an complete disaster <br />to <br />          submerge the tamil heartland. </p>
<p>          The count of Pandya king Sarangadwaja who was killed by <br />ashwatama <br />      was <br />          to have been proficient in chariots (curious aspect) as the <br />time <br />      line <br />          was more towards the proto - indo - iranian time. </p>
<p>          The name Sarangadwaja does not come anywhere in the list of <br />      pandya <br />          kings from the early sangam age. </p>
<p>          There are a lot of missing links and i believe like Dwaraka <br />they <br />      are <br />          under the ocean waiting to be brought up. </p>
<p>          PS: I have always been curious of why tamil kings have been <br />so <br />          attracted to the sea, i would guess its some part of their <br />      genetics :-<br />          )</p>

<p>            Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people <br />themselves, <br />      the <br />          color of clouds before rain to be exact.

<p>              I have also read that Indian peninsula was also part of <br />      Africa <br />          millions <br />              of years back... and comparisons between ancient Nagas <br />and <br />      Negros.</p>
<p>              Though our Dear Sathish takes exception, the storyline <br />of <br />          Ramayana is <br />              zeroed to 5500 AD ... say 7500 years back .. okay.. let <br />us <br />      assume <br />          10000 <br />              years back !</p>
<p>              Georgraphical changes - in nature - is unlikely to have <br />      occured <br />          in a <br />              SHORT SPAN of 10000 years .. is what I consider!</p>

<p>            NO it is much nearer than that [ not MILLIONS of years, <br />not even<br />            10,000 years]<br />            IF my memory does not fail me, [ hopefully] ? it was <br />Neelakanta<br />            Shastri who wrote that Ramayana preceded mahabharatha [ if <br />not <br />          another<br />            author] In the ramayana, the distal parts of the Ganges <br />basin <br />      are <br />          left<br />            vague, as are southern descriptions[ probably unexplored]<br />            IN the Mahabaratha, the Ganges valley is decribed to its <br />delta.<br />            In a another book " the tracing of the Real krishna," it <br />is <br />      pointed<br />            out that, if the date of the mahabaratha, is pushed to <br />3000BC, <br />      as<br />            opposed to the general accepted dates of 1500BC, 2 facts <br />emerge.<br />            Balarama, to avoid joining the WAR, goes on a pilgrimage, <br />cris<br />            crossing the ' SARASWATI ' river in the process. The <br />recent <br />          discovery<br />            of the [ possible ] 'Saraswati' as a dried river basin <br />      underneath <br />          the<br />            rajasthan desert, lends some support to this theory.<br />            Further, the mahabaratha mentions a PANDYA who assisted ? <br />which <br />          side.<br />            Putting it together, there is no way for joined land <br />masses of <br />          million<br />            s of years, AND , the Ramayana is not that old. An <br />intereting<br />            obsrvation. These "ARYAN' people of these two epics were <br />open-<br />      sky<br />            loving sun-loving pastoral grass land NOMADS/ cowherds.. <br />hating/<br />            fearing the jungle and the darker skin people. YET in both <br />      epics, it<br />            is therefore THE punishment-- into the jungle for FOURTEEN <br />      YEARS [<br />            MBRATHA 13+1] !.</p>
<p>            Further, i have read [ i DONT KNOW SANSKRIT] that ten-<br />headed , <br />      and <br />            very bad person, have similar spelling, and maybe<br />            pronounciation- distortion- - hence the 10-headed ravanan <br />      story..</p>

<p>Hi,<br /> <br />Is there any timeline information that is available in Mahabharatha? Especialy like the time when the war is declared and the time actually war started? Also worthwhile information would be to see how this Pandya king would have received the invitation to side with the Pandavas and how long did it take for him to join the troop buildup from Madurai or Tamilnadu. <br /> <br />Since Mahabharatha has extensive astronomical details, we can look at the same objectively.<br /> <br />Regards<br /> <br />Nanda</p>

<p>Sarangadwaja alias Malayadwaja was initially Krishna's enemy and later joins pandavas. He is mentioned as a 'pandya prince' but there is no reference or evidence that these pandyas are the same as the pandya race in later Tamil Naadu. All that the Mahabharata says is <br /> <br />Pandya, who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhistra, the king of kings (5:19). <br />There hath come Pandya. Remarkably heroic and endued with prowess and energy that have no parallel, he is devoted to the Pandava cause. (5:22).</p>
<p>Is there any parellel to this Malaydhwaja and the father of Goddess Meenakshi, also a Malaydhwaja? Interesting line of thought,<br /> <br />Malathi<br />--- On Sun, 12/28/08, Ravi <ravi_eds@yahoo. com  wrote:</p>

<p>You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />landscapes etc. </p>
<p>The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate movement. </p>

<p>        The name Sarangadwaja does not come anywhere in the list of <br />    pandya <br />        kings from the early sangam age. </p>

<p>          Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people themselves, <br />    the <br />        color of clouds before rain to be exact.

<p>  I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar was <br />a<br />  part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. It<br />  is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>  You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />  landscapes etc. </p>
<p>  The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />  kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />  earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate movement. </p>
<p>  Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over period <br />of<br />  time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was dissolved<br />  into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of <br />Iravana.</p>

<p>            Further, i have read [ i DONT KNOW SANSKRIT] that ten-<br />headed , <br />      and <br />            very bad person, have similar spelling, and maybe<br />            pronounciation- distortion- - hence the 10-headed ravanan <br />      story..</p>

<p>  I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar was <br />a<br />  part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. It<br />  is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>  You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />  landscapes etc. </p>
<p>  The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />  kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />  earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate movement. </p>
<p>  Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over period <br />of<br />  time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was dissolved<br />  into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of <br />Iravana.</p>

<p>          The Mythical land of lemuria was supposed to have been <br />existant <br />      from <br />          350Mil to about 5000 years ago.</p>
<p>          There have been many studies concluding that the large <br />landmass <br />      broke <br />          into smaller islands. </p>
<p>          The last of the islands was to have submerged in the 5500's <br />      (though <br />          the prime mass was to have sunk in 16000 BC). </p>
<p>          The belief is that the current madurai was constructed as <br />the <br />      pandya <br />          king was instructed by the elements of an complete disaster <br />to <br />          submerge the tamil heartland. </p>
<p>          The count of Pandya king Sarangadwaja who was killed by <br />ashwatama <br />      was <br />          to have been proficient in chariots (curious aspect) as the <br />time <br />      line <br />          was more towards the proto - indo - iranian time. </p>
<p>          The name Sarangadwaja does not come anywhere in the list of <br />      pandya <br />          kings from the early sangam age. </p>
<p>          There are a lot of missing links and i believe like Dwaraka <br />they <br />      are <br />          under the ocean waiting to be brought up. </p>
<p>          PS: I have always been curious of why tamil kings have been <br />so <br />          attracted to the sea, i would guess its some part of their <br />      genetics :-<br />          )</p>

<p>            Hi Sir, Ramayana does precede the Mahabharata was not <br />aware of <br />          any arguments to the contrary on this. The Saraswati <br />dateline is <br />          interesting. the may I ask who is the Pandya king in the <br />      Mahabharat <br />          and which side he fought on?</p>
<p>            Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people <br />themselves, <br />      the <br />          color of clouds before rain to be exact. If you look at <br />clouds <br />      they <br />          are a dark shade of grey blue, some african americans are <br />that <br />          color. Why would their tribe be afraid of 'other dark <br />skinned <br />          people'?</p>

<p>              Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>              I have also read that Indian peninsula was also part of <br />      Africa <br />          millions <br />              of years back... and comparisons between ancient Nagas <br />and <br />      Negros.</p>
<p>              Though our Dear Sathish takes exception, the storyline <br />of <br />          Ramayana is <br />              zeroed to 5500 AD ... say 7500 years back .. okay.. let <br />us <br />      assume <br />          10000 <br />              years back !</p>
<p>              Georgraphical changes - in nature - is unlikely to have <br />      occured <br />          in a <br />              SHORT SPAN of 10000 years .. is what I consider!</p>

<p>            NO it is much nearer than that [ not MILLIONS of years, <br />not even<br />            10,000 years]<br />            IF my memory does not fail me, [ hopefully] ? it was <br />Neelakanta<br />            Shastri who wrote that Ramayana preceded mahabharatha [ if <br />not <br />          another<br />            author] In the ramayana, the distal parts of the Ganges <br />basin <br />      are <br />          left<br />            vague, as are southern descriptions[ probably unexplored]<br />            IN the Mahabaratha, the Ganges valley is decribed to its <br />delta.<br />            In a another book " the tracing of the Real krishna," it <br />is <br />      pointed<br />            out that, if the date of the mahabaratha, is pushed to <br />3000BC, <br />      as<br />            opposed to the general accepted dates of 1500BC, 2 facts <br />emerge.<br />            Balarama, to avoid joining the WAR, goes on a pilgrimage, <br />cris<br />            crossing the ' SARASWATI ' river in the process. The <br />recent <br />          discovery<br />            of the [ possible ] 'Saraswati' as a dried river basin <br />      underneath <br />          the<br />            rajasthan desert, lends some support to this theory.<br />            Further, the mahabaratha mentions a PANDYA who assisted ? <br />which <br />          side.<br />            Putting it together, there is no way for joined land <br />masses of <br />          million<br />            s of years, AND , the Ramayana is not that old. An <br />intereting<br />            obsrvation.

<p>          Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people themselves, <br />    the <br />        color of clouds before rain to be exact.

<p>          NO it is much nearer than that [ not MILLIONS of years, not even<br />          10,000 years]<br />          IF my memory does not fail me, [ hopefully] ? it was Neelakanta<br />          Shastri who wrote that Ramayana preceded mahabharatha [ if not <br />        another<br />          author] In the ramayana, the distal parts of the Ganges basin <br />    are <br />        left<br />          vague, as are southern descriptions[ probably unexplored]<br />          IN the Mahabaratha, the Ganges valley is decribed to its delta.<br />          In a another book " the tracing of the Real krishna," it is <br />    pointed<br />          out that, if the date of the mahabaratha, is pushed to 3000BC, <br />    as<br />          opposed to the general accepted dates of 1500BC, 2 facts emerge.<br />          Balarama, to avoid joining the WAR, goes on a pilgrimage, cris<br />          crossing the ' SARASWATI ' river in the process. The recent <br />        discovery<br />          of the [ possible ] 'Saraswati' as a dried river basin <br />    underneath <br />        the<br />          rajasthan desert, lends some support to this theory.<br />          Further, the mahabaratha mentions a PANDYA who assisted ? which <br />        side.<br />          Putting it together, there is no way for joined land masses of <br />        million<br />          s of years, AND , the Ramayana is not that old. An intereting<br />          obsrvation. These "ARYAN' people of these two epics were open-<br />    sky<br />          loving sun-loving pastoral grass land NOMADS/ cowherds.. hating/<br />          fearing the jungle and the darker skin people. YET in both <br />    epics, it<br />          is therefore THE punishment-- into the jungle for FOURTEEN <br />    YEARS [<br />          MBRATHA 13+1] !.</p>
<p>          Further, i have read [ i DONT KNOW SANSKRIT] that ten-headed , <br />    and <br />          very bad person, have similar spelling, and maybe<br />          pronounciation- distortion- - hence the 10-headed ravanan <br />    story..</p>

<p>Dear Sir, may I ask couple of clarification - if Pandya kingdom was <br />started by Dushasana's grandson how does Bheeshma mention it? Since <br />both pandavas and Kauravas only had sons during Bhishma's time.</p>
<p>Where in Mahabharat is mention of Ithma vagan and Prathaba Pandian?</p>

<p>  I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar was <br />a<br />  part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. It<br />  is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>  You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />  landscapes etc. </p>
<p>  The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />  kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />  earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate movement. </p>
<p>  Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over period <br />of<br />  time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was dissolved<br />  into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of <br />Iravana.</p>

<p>    I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar <br />was <br />  a<br />    part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. <br />It<br />    is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>    You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />    landscapes etc. </p>
<p>    The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />    kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />    earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate <br />movement. </p>
<p>    Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over <br />period <br />  of<br />    time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was <br />dissolved<br />    into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of <br />  Iravana.</p>

<p>            The Mythical land of lemuria was supposed to have been <br />  existant <br />        from <br />            350Mil to about 5000 years ago.</p>
<p>            There have been many studies concluding that the large <br />  landmass <br />        broke <br />            into smaller islands. </p>
<p>            The last of the islands was to have submerged in the <br />5500's <br />        (though <br />            the prime mass was to have sunk in 16000 BC). </p>
<p>            The belief is that the current madurai was constructed as <br />  the <br />        pandya <br />            king was instructed by the elements of an complete <br />disaster <br />  to <br />            submerge the tamil heartland. </p>
<p>            The count of Pandya king Sarangadwaja who was killed by <br />  ashwatama <br />        was <br />            to have been proficient in chariots (curious aspect) as <br />the <br />  time <br />        line <br />            was more towards the proto - indo - iranian time. </p>
<p>            The name Sarangadwaja does not come anywhere in the list <br />of <br />        pandya <br />            kings from the early sangam age. </p>
<p>            There are a lot of missing links and i believe like <br />Dwaraka <br />  they <br />        are <br />            under the ocean waiting to be brought up. </p>
<p>            PS: I have always been curious of why tamil kings have <br />been <br />  so <br />            attracted to the sea, i would guess its some part of <br />their <br />        genetics :-<br />            )</p>

The Saraswati <br />  dateline is <br />            interesting. the may I ask who is the Pandya king in the <br />        Mahabharat <br />            and which side he fought on?</p>
<p>              Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people <br />  themselves, <br />        the <br />            color of clouds before rain to be exact.

<p>    I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar <br />was <br />  a<br />    part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. <br />It<br />    is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>    You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />    landscapes etc. </p>
<p>    The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />    kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />    earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate <br />movement. </p>
<p>    Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over <br />period <br />  of<br />    time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was <br />dissolved<br />    into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of <br />  Iravana.</p>

<p>        That seems interesting, even artifacts on land are lost in a <br />  few <br />        hundred years and humans still do not possess the technology <br />to <br />        master the ocean and I doubt if they will even after our <br />great <br />  grand <br />        kids walk on earth.</p>

<p>            The Mythical land of lemuria was supposed to have been <br />  existant <br />        from <br />            350Mil to about 5000 years ago.</p>
<p>            There have been many studies concluding that the large <br />  landmass <br />        broke <br />            into smaller islands. </p>
<p>            The last of the islands was to have submerged in the <br />5500's <br />        (though <br />            the prime mass was to have sunk in 16000 BC). </p>
<p>            The belief is that the current madurai was constructed as <br />  the <br />        pandya <br />            king was instructed by the elements of an complete <br />disaster <br />  to <br />            submerge the tamil heartland. </p>
<p>            The count of Pandya king Sarangadwaja who was killed by <br />  ashwatama <br />        was <br />            to have been proficient in chariots (curious aspect) as <br />the <br />  time <br />        line <br />            was more towards the proto - indo - iranian time. </p>
<p>            The name Sarangadwaja does not come anywhere in the list <br />of <br />        pandya <br />            kings from the early sangam age. </p>
<p>            There are a lot of missing links and i believe like <br />Dwaraka <br />  they <br />        are <br />            under the ocean waiting to be brought up. </p>
<p>            PS: I have always been curious of why tamil kings have <br />been <br />  so <br />            attracted to the sea, i would guess its some part of <br />their <br />        genetics :-<br />            )</p>

The Saraswati <br />  dateline is <br />            interesting. the may I ask who is the Pandya king in the <br />        Mahabharat <br />            and which side he fought on?</p>
<p>              Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people <br />  themselves, <br />        the <br />            color of clouds before rain to be exact. If you look at <br />  clouds <br />        they <br />            are a dark shade of grey blue, some african americans are <br />  that <br />            color.

<p>                Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>                I have also read that Indian peninsula was also part <br />of <br />        Africa <br />            millions <br />                of years back... and comparisons between ancient <br />Nagas <br />  and <br />        Negros.</p>
<p>                Though our Dear Sathish takes exception, the <br />storyline <br />  of <br />            Ramayana is <br />                zeroed to 5500 AD ... say 7500 years back .. okay.. <br />let <br />  us <br />        assume <br />            10000 <br />                years back !</p>
<p>                Georgraphical changes - in nature - is unlikely to <br />have <br />        occured <br />            in a <br />                SHORT SPAN of 10000 years .. is what I consider!</p>
<p>                thanks for responding.</p>

<p>              NO it is much nearer than that [ not MILLIONS of years, <br />  not even<br />              10,000 years]<br />              IF my memory does not fail me, [ hopefully] ? it was <br />  Neelakanta<br />              Shastri who wrote that Ramayana preceded mahabharatha [ <br />  if not <br />            another<br />              author] In the ramayana, the distal parts of the Ganges <br />  basin <br />        are <br />            left<br />              vague, as are southern descriptions[ probably <br />unexplored]<br />              IN the Mahabaratha, the Ganges valley is decribed to <br />its <br />  delta.<br />              In a another book " the tracing of the Real krishna," <br />it <br />  is <br />        pointed<br />              out that, if the date of the mahabaratha, is pushed to <br />  3000BC, <br />        as<br />              opposed to the general accepted dates of 1500BC, 2 <br />facts <br />  emerge.<br />              Balarama, to avoid joining the WAR, goes on a <br />pilgrimage, <br />  cris<br />              crossing the ' SARASWATI ' river in the process. The <br />  recent <br />            discovery<br />              of the [ possible ] 'Saraswati' as a dried river basin <br />        underneath <br />            the<br />              rajasthan desert, lends some support to this theory.<br />              Further, the mahabaratha mentions a PANDYA who <br />assisted ? <br />  which <br />            side.<br />              Putting it together, there is no way for joined land <br />  masses of <br />            million<br />              s of years, AND , the Ramayana is not that old. An <br />  intereting<br />              obsrvation. These "ARYAN' people of these two epics <br />were <br />  open-<br />        sky<br />              loving sun-loving pastoral grass land NOMADS/ <br />cowherds.. <br />  hating/<br />              fearing the jungle and the darker skin people. YET in <br />  both <br />        epics, it<br />              is therefore THE punishment-- into the jungle for <br />  FOURTEEN <br />        YEARS [<br />              MBRATHA 13+1] !.</p>
<p>              Further, i have read [ i DONT KNOW SANSKRIT] that ten-<br />  headed , <br />        and <br />              very bad person, have similar spelling, and maybe<br />              pronounciation- distortion- - hence the 10-headed <br />ravanan <br />        story..</p>

<p>          The Mythical land of lemuria was supposed to have been <br />existant <br />      from <br />          350Mil to about 5000 years ago.</p>
<p>          There have been many studies concluding that the large <br />landmass <br />      broke <br />          into smaller islands. </p>
<p>          The last of the islands was to have submerged in the 5500's <br />      (though <br />          the prime mass was to have sunk in 16000 BC). </p>
<p>          The belief is that the current madurai was constructed as <br />the <br />      pandya <br />          king was instructed by the elements of an complete disaster <br />to <br />          submerge the tamil heartland. </p>
<p>          The count of Pandya king Sarangadwaja who was killed by <br />ashwatama <br />      was <br />          to have been proficient in chariots (curious aspect) as the <br />time <br />      line <br />          was more towards the proto - indo - iranian time. </p>
<p>          The name Sarangadwaja does not come anywhere in the list of <br />      pandya <br />          kings from the early sangam age. </p>
<p>          There are a lot of missing links and i believe like Dwaraka <br />they <br />      are <br />          under the ocean waiting to be brought up. </p>
<p>          PS: I have always been curious of why tamil kings have been <br />so <br />          attracted to the sea, i would guess its some part of their <br />      genetics :-<br />          )</p>

<p>            Hi Sir, Ramayana does precede the Mahabharata was not <br />aware of <br />          any arguments to the contrary on this. The Saraswati <br />dateline is <br />          interesting. the may I ask who is the Pandya king in the <br />      Mahabharat <br />          and which side he fought on?</p>
<p>            Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people <br />themselves, <br />      the <br />          color of clouds before rain to be exact. If you look at <br />clouds <br />      they <br />          are a dark shade of grey blue, some african americans are <br />that <br />          color.

<p>              Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>              I have also read that Indian peninsula was also part of <br />      Africa <br />          millions <br />              of years back... and comparisons between ancient Nagas <br />and <br />      Negros.</p>
<p>              Though our Dear Sathish takes exception, the storyline <br />of <br />          Ramayana is <br />              zeroed to 5500 AD ... say 7500 years back .. okay.. let <br />us <br />      assume <br />          10000 <br />              years back !</p>
<p>              Georgraphical changes - in nature - is unlikely to have <br />      occured <br />          in a <br />              SHORT SPAN of 10000 years .. is what I consider!</p>

<p>            NO it is much nearer than that [ not MILLIONS of years, <br />not even<br />            10,000 years]<br />            IF my memory does not fail me, [ hopefully] ? it was <br />Neelakanta<br />            Shastri who wrote that Ramayana preceded mahabharatha [ <br />if not <br />          another<br />            author] In the ramayana, the distal parts of the Ganges <br />basin <br />      are <br />          left<br />            vague, as are southern descriptions[ probably unexplored]<br />            IN the Mahabaratha, the Ganges valley is decribed to its <br />delta.<br />            In a another book " the tracing of the Real krishna," it <br />is <br />      pointed<br />            out that, if the date of the mahabaratha, is pushed to <br />3000BC, <br />      as<br />            opposed to the general accepted dates of 1500BC, 2 facts <br />emerge.<br />            Balarama, to avoid joining the WAR, goes on a pilgrimage, <br />cris<br />            crossing the ' SARASWATI ' river in the process. The <br />recent <br />          discovery<br />            of the [ possible ] 'Saraswati' as a dried river basin <br />      underneath <br />          the<br />            rajasthan desert, lends some support to this theory.<br />            Further, the mahabaratha mentions a PANDYA who assisted ? <br />which <br />          side.<br />            Putting it together, there is no way for joined land <br />masses of <br />          million<br />            s of years, AND , the Ramayana is not that old. An <br />intereting<br />            obsrvation. These "ARYAN' people of these two epics were <br />open-<br />      sky<br />            loving sun-loving pastoral grass land NOMADS/ cowherds.. <br />hating/<br />            fearing the jungle and the darker skin people.

<p>            Further, i have read [ i DONT KNOW SANSKRIT] that ten-<br />headed , <br />      and <br />            very bad person, have similar spelling, and maybe<br />            pronounciation- distortion- - hence the 10-headed ravanan <br />      story..</p></sps10142004@></p></chtsree@></p></intellisurfer@></p></ravi_eds@></p></intellisurfer@></p></blockquote>

<p>  I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar was <br />a<br />  part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. It<br />  is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>  You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />  landscapes etc. </p>
<p>  The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />  kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />  earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate movement. </p>
<p>  Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over period <br />of<br />  time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was dissolved<br />  into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of <br />Iravana.</p>

<p>      I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar <br />  was a<br />      part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start <br />with. <br />  It<br />      is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>      You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on <br />the<br />      landscapes etc. </p>
<p>      The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />      kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />      earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate <br />  movement. </p>
<p>      Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over <br />  period of<br />      time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was <br />  dissolved<br />      into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of <br />  Iravana.</p>

<p>          That seems interesting, even artifacts on land are lost in <br />a <br />  few <br />          hundred years and humans still do not possess the <br />technology <br />  to <br />          master the ocean and I doubt if they will even after our <br />great<br />    grand <br />          kids walk on earth.</p>

        <p>Is it mandatory that the land mass as islands must be seen ?<br />So under the sea there is no land or what ? </p>
<p>If you could think as the land mass as a flat land or plateau thats <br />difficult to digest, but if it is a series of low lying valleys with <br />small mountains over unstable volcanic terrain, that can be a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of <br />digene.. :) </acronym></p>

<p>    I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar <br />was a<br />    part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. <br />It<br />    is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>    You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />    landscapes etc. </p>
<p>    The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />    kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />    earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate <br />movement. </p>
<p>    Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over <br />period of<br />    time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was <br />dissolved<br />    into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of <br />Iravana.</p>

<p>            The Mythical land of lemuria was supposed to have been <br />existant <br />        from <br />            350Mil to about 5000 years ago.</p>
<p>            There have been many studies concluding that the large <br />landmass <br />        broke <br />            into smaller islands. </p>
<p>            The last of the islands was to have submerged in the <br />5500's <br />        (though <br />            the prime mass was to have sunk in 16000 BC). </p>
<p>            The belief is that the current madurai was constructed as <br />the <br />        pandya <br />            king was instructed by the elements of an complete <br />disaster to <br />            submerge the tamil heartland. </p>
<p>            The count of Pandya king Sarangadwaja who was killed by<br />  ashwatama <br />        was <br />            to have been proficient in chariots (curious aspect) as <br />the<br />  time <br />        line <br />            was more towards the proto - indo - iranian time. </p>
<p>            The name Sarangadwaja does not come anywhere in the list <br />of <br />        pandya <br />            kings from the early sangam age. </p>
<p>            There are a lot of missing links and i believe like <br />Dwaraka<br />  they <br />        are <br />            under the ocean waiting to be brought up. </p>
<p>            PS: I have always been curious of why tamil kings have <br />been so <br />            attracted to the sea, i would guess its some part of <br />their <br />        genetics :-<br />            )</p>

The Saraswati<br />  dateline is <br />            interesting. the may I ask who is the Pandya king in the <br />        Mahabharat <br />            and which side he fought on?</p>
<p>              Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people<br />  themselves, <br />        the <br />            color of clouds before rain to be exact.

<p>                I have also read that Indian peninsula was also part <br />of <br />        Africa <br />            millions <br />                of years back... and comparisons between ancient <br />Nagas and <br />        Negros.</p>
<p>                Though our Dear Sathish takes exception, the <br />storyline of <br />            Ramayana is <br />                zeroed to 5500 AD ... say 7500 years back .. okay.. <br />let us <br />        assume <br />            10000 <br />                years back !</p>
<p>                Georgraphical changes - in nature - is unlikely to <br />have <br />        occured <br />            in a <br />                SHORT SPAN of 10000 years .. is what I consider!</p>

<p>??? 2. Our Rajendra Chola's conquests includes countries on the otherside of Bay of Bengal. One of them is mentioned as 'ELAMURI DESAM' sounds like LEMURIA.....? <br />??? There is also a small town called Madurai?? <br />??? 3. Vamanatha Puri was the name of Mylapore in 22nd Tirthangarar Neminatha Swamy's time. At that time Tsunami attacked 2 times, and he ordered to form Mylai on the "Western side". So, eastern side drowned.<br />??? 4. Manimegai tells about 'Sambadhi Vanam'. Sambadhi was Jadayu's brother. In Srilanka, onthe banks of Kalyani River, near Ruhana, there is aplace Seethawake, where Sita was imprisoned. and Samantha Koodam which is named after Lakshmana and named Samana. And Ravanan Kottai is believed to be under the sea, south west of Srilanka.<br />???? 5. Kapada Puram and Pahruli River are in Purananooru. <br />????????????????????????????? (in my opinion, if we take 'Raman Ilangaiku Sellavillai' as correct, Valmiki Ramayanam Kambaramayanam, Thulasi Ramayanam, Sahasranamam, Sundara Gandam, and so many Ramanayams, Puranams like Kalki Puranam, Koorma Puranam, Garuda Puranam, Padma Puranam,? Temples which are plenty for Rama, and all telling about Rama, have to be thrown into Bay of Bengal.?

<p>I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar was a<br />part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. It<br />is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />landscapes etc. </p>
<p>The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate movement. </p>
<p>Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over period of<br />time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was dissolved<br />into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of Iravana.</p>

<p>          Hi Sir, Ramayana does precede the Mahabharata was not aware of <br />        any arguments to the contrary on this. The Saraswati dateline is <br />        interesting. the may I ask who is the Pandya king in the <br />    Mahabharat <br />        and which side he fought on?</p>
<p>          Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people themselves, <br />    the <br />        color of clouds before rain to be exact. If you look at clouds <br />    they <br />        are a dark shade of grey blue, some african americans are that <br />        color.

<p>            I have also read that Indian peninsula was also part of <br />    Africa <br />        millions <br />            of years back... and comparisons between ancient Nagas and <br />    Negros.</p>
<p>            Though our Dear Sathish takes exception, the storyline of <br />        Ramayana is <br />            zeroed to 5500 AD ... say 7500 years back .. okay.. let us <br />    assume <br />        10000 <br />            years back !</p>
<p>            Georgraphical changes - in nature - is unlikely to have <br />    occured <br />        in a <br />            SHORT SPAN of 10000 years .. is what I consider!</p>

<p>          NO it is much nearer than that [ not MILLIONS of years, not even<br />          10,000 years]<br />          IF my memory does not fail me, [ hopefully] ? it was Neelakanta<br />          Shastri who wrote that Ramayana preceded mahabharatha [ if not <br />        another<br />          author] In the ramayana, the distal parts of the Ganges basin <br />    are <br />        left<br />          vague, as are southern descriptions[ probably unexplored]<br />          IN the Mahabaratha, the Ganges valley is decribed to its delta.<br />          In a another book " the tracing of the Real krishna," it is <br />    pointed<br />          out that, if the date of the mahabaratha, is pushed to 3000BC, <br />    as<br />          opposed to the general accepted dates of 1500BC, 2 facts emerge.<br />          Balarama, to avoid joining the WAR, goes on a pilgrimage, cris<br />          crossing the ' SARASWATI ' river in the process. The recent <br />        discovery<br />          of the [ possible ] 'Saraswati' as a dried river basin <br />    underneath <br />        the<br />          rajasthan desert, lends some support to this theory.<br />          Further, the mahabaratha mentions a PANDYA who assisted ? which <br />        side.<br />          Putting it together, there is no way for joined land masses of <br />        million<br />          s of years, AND , the Ramayana is not that old. An intereting<br />          obsrvation. These "ARYAN' people of these two epics were open-<br />    sky<br />          loving sun-loving pastoral grass land NOMADS/ cowherds.. hating/<br />          fearing the jungle and the darker skin people. YET in both <br />    epics, it<br />          is therefore THE punishment-- into the jungle for FOURTEEN <br />    YEARS [<br />          MBRATHA 13+1] !.</p>
<p>          Further, i have read [ i DONT KNOW SANSKRIT] that ten-headed , <br />    and <br />          very bad person, have similar spelling, and maybe<br />          pronounciation- distortion- - hence the 10-headed ravanan <br />    story..</p>

        <p>Sarangadwaja alias Malayadwaja was initially Krishna's enemy and later joins pandavas. He is mentioned as a 'pandya prince' but there is no reference or evidence that these pandyas are the same as the pandya race in later Tamil Naadu. All that the Mahabharata says is <br />?<br />Pandya, who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhistra, the king of kings (5:19). <br />There hath come Pandya. Remarkably heroic and endued with prowess and energy that have no parallel, he is devoted to the Pandava cause. (5:22).</p>
<p>Is there any parellel to this Malaydhwaja and the father of Goddess Meenakshi, also a Malaydhwaja? Interesting line of thought,<br />?<br />Malathi<br />--- On Sun, 12/28/08, Ravi <ravi_eds@yahoo.com  wrote:</p>

<p>I am not sure what you are pointing at, but i believe Mdagascar was a<br />part of ancient lemuria (for want of another term) to start with. It<br />is definitely above sea level.</p>
<p>You can google for under water sonar studies / explorations on the<br />landscapes etc. </p>
<p>The entire region spanning from madagascar to australia and<br />kanyakumari to antartica has tectonic plate movements. Frequent<br />earthquakes / volcanoes / Tsunamis are part of the plate movement. </p>
<p>Instead of entire land mass sinking over night, i think over period of<br />time the land was split into multiple chunks and each was dissolved<br />into sea. Last of the mass could have possibly been Lanka of Iravana.</p>

<p>          NO it is much nearer than that [ not MILLIONS of years, not even<br />          10,000 years]<br />          IF my memory does not fail me, [ hopefully] ? it was Neelakanta<br />          Shastri who wrote that Ramayana preceded mahabharatha [ if not <br />        another<br />          author] In the ramayana, the distal parts of the Ganges basin <br />    are <br />        left<br />          vague, as are southern descriptions[ probably unexplored]<br />          IN the Mahabaratha, the Ganges valley is decribed to its delta.<br />          In a another book " the tracing of the Real krishna," it is <br />    pointed<br />          out that, if the date of the mahabaratha, is pushed to 3000BC, <br />    as<br />          opposed to the general accepted dates of 1500BC, 2 facts emerge.<br />          Balarama, to avoid joining the WAR, goes on a pilgrimage, cris<br />          crossing the ' SARASWATI ' river in the process. The recent <br />        discovery<br />          of the [ possible ] 'Saraswati' as a dried river basin <br />    underneath <br />        the<br />          rajasthan desert, lends some support to this theory.<br />          Further, the mahabaratha mentions a PANDYA who assisted ? which <br />        side.<br />          Putting it together, there is no way for joined land masses of <br />        million<br />          s of years, AND , the Ramayana is not that old. An intereting<br />          obsrvation. These "ARYAN' people of these two epics were open-<br />    sky<br />          loving sun-loving pastoral grass land NOMADS/ cowherds.. hating/<br />          fearing the jungle and the darker skin people. YET in both <br />    epics, it<br />          is therefore THE punishment-- into the jungle for FOURTEEN <br />    YEARS [<br />          MBRATHA 13+1] !.</p>
<p>          Further, i have read [ i DONT KNOW SANSKRIT] that ten-headed , <br />    and <br />          very bad person, have similar spelling, and maybe<br />          pronounciation- distortion- - hence the 10-headed ravanan <br />    story..</p>

        <p>Hi Sir, Ramayana does precede the Mahabharata was not?aware of any?arguments to the contrary on this. The Saraswati?dateline is interesting. themay I ask who is the Pandya king in the Mahabharat and which side he fought on?<br />?<br />Also both Rama and Krishna were dark skinned people themselves, the color of clouds before rain to be exact. If you look at clouds they are a dark shade of grey blue, some african americans are that color.? Why would their tribe be afraid of 'other dark skinned people'?<br />?<br />Malathi</p>
