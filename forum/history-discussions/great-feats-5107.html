<p>you did well by clausing your initial statement...for humor sake. I <br />take your side ...kings are too precious to lead upfront in battle <br />and in most cases they held together their vast lands by surrounding <br />themselves with good hands and not by encasing themselves in iron. <br />Unfortunately our later year maharajas did exactly this...read the <br />maharajas of india, by ann morrow of the later ( princely states <br />during british rule)....you will see their leelaigal...portly, 50 <br />year old, physcially jestor like maharajas dancing with petite <br />damsels of europe, maharajas keeping ( and wining) bets like who <br />will deflower the maximum vi....ns in a year, importing lions from <br />africa because their hunting grounds did not have them in enough <br />number, using the largest diamond in the world as a paper weight, <br />parading around completely naked except for a diamond brocade as a <br />show of kingly masculinity.....a complete silver ensemble train set <br />that could serve dinner to your guests.....</p>
<p>but dont beleive you can bring in <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym /RJC in similar vein....you <br />could possibly get away with murder in your state, but for you <br />disperse these false propaganda across a region as far away as <br />indonesia///china...they were truely great. the big temple and <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  <br />temple were superhuman efforts built to crown their fantastic <br />feats...feats that make you sit up and think...what bade them on <br />this path...reminded of this...dreams are not what you get in your <br />sleep, dreams are what make you loose your sleep.</acronym></acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  hi vijay;   just for humor sake, how sure are you that the armor in Pudukottai <br />museum is<br />  indeed the one worn by Kattabommmu? Maybe he was just 5ft tall and <br />ensured<br />  that he got his ironsmith to make a huge armor so that future <br />generations<br />  would think he is a bull (kaattu erumai in the words of our <br />wonderful<br />  Vadivelu).<br />  Remember "Varalaaru miga mukkiyam amaichare"<br />  I hold a similar opinion about kalvettus and paintings of our <br />maharajas. Do<br />  you really think a sculptor/painter/poet would be rewarded if he <br />dint<br />  glorify the king. they had to make the king look larger than life <br />else they<br />  risk loosing their life.<br />  Im not trying to say all our kings were like that but there must <br />have been<br />  some really smart chaps. Infact if i were king i would probably <br />want myself<br />  painted like a hero and want future generations talk only about my <br />victories<br />  with some masala added. While this was being written i would be <br />spending<br />  time in the anthapuram..who cares about bringing Ganga or winning <br />wars. :)<br />  :) :)</p>

<p>    hi sps sir</p>
<p>    nice of you to bring this up...in these days when everyone asks <br />for<br />    proof that our heros were indeed heros..and not like 23ram <br />pullikesi<br />    ( the painting episode)</p>
<p>    anyway, we do hear of superhuman feats ...even from the<br />    ramayana ..rama i think is said to be capable of shooting an <br />arrow<br />    right though 5 full grown tree trunks, dasarata using just <br />sounds to<br />    locate his targets and shoot them down....he is also said to have<br />    shot his arrows in rameshwaram ( the many wells)</p>
<p>    the buddha was once challenged to demonstrate his archery <br />skills. He<br />    asked for five arrows, and shot four of them simultaneously in <br />four<br />    directions in the sky. A raven flying high up momentarily found <br />its<br />    way blocked everywhere. Then he shot his fifth arrow and brought<br />    down the confused raven. This episode is narrated in the text <br />Kanjur<br />    Dulwa.</p>
<p>    and of course arjuna looking into the reflection and...chanced on<br />    this interesting article ( dont have the full one though ) but <br />the<br />    concept is quite remarkable..the way they draw parallels</p>
<p>    The laparoscopic surgeon is trained to acquire advanced skills to<br />    perform the complicated laparoscopic surgery of the target <br />tissue in<br />    a three-dimensional (3D) space by viewing its two-dimensional <br />(2D)<br />    video image. This technique finds its parallel in a very ancient<br />    archery episode portrayed in the longest and the greatest Indian<br />    epic, Mahabarata. In this epic, Arjuna, the master archer, is<br />    required to employ the strategy of aiming at the eye of a target<br />    fish rotating above his head by viewing its reflected image <br />below in<br />    water; of course, all this to win the hand of a beautiful <br />princess!<br />    Arjuna is so trained that he cannot but excel in focusing his<br />    attention on his target. A comparative study of the laparoscopic<br />    surgeon and the ancient master archer is done in this paper with <br />a<br />    view to throwing light on the interesting similarities between <br />the<br />    archer and the modern laparoscopic surgeon with respect to <br />training<br />    methods, skills, and techniques.<br />    <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/" title="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/</a></p>

<p>          i remember reading an article in Mr.Jaybee's website about <br />the<br />        tamil weapon<br />          Valari. This is also a boomerang shaped weapon but it does <br />not<br />        return. So<br />          the name Valari must have been concocted from Valai Eri.<br />    Knives<br />        were<br />          attached to the ends and then thrown at the enemy making it<br />      highly<br />          destructive and dangerous. Periya Marudhu (of Marudhu<br />    brothers)<br />      is<br />        said to<br />          have had the capability to throw the valari straight across<br />    the<br />        Theppakulam<br />          in Madurai. Quite a feat considering the size of the kulam <br />and<br />      the<br />        weight of<br />          that weapon!!</p>

<p>With the emergence of the Chola polity during the 10th-century in <br />southern India, a<br />major new player entered into Asian maritime trade. Tansen Sen <br />suggests that "some<br />credit for the `emergence of a world market' must go to the Chola <br />(or C?la) kingdom in<br />Southern India. The trading ports and mercantile guilds of the Chola <br />kingdom, he<br />suggests, played a significant role in linking the markets of China <br />to the rest of the<br />world." 97 He cites the following passage from a Cola ruler as the <br />rationale for<br />participating in and encouraging maritime trade:<br />Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants <br />and<br />good horses attach to yourself by providing them with villages and <br />decent<br />dwellings in the city, by affording them daily audience, presents <br />and allowing<br />them profits. Then those articles will never go to your enemies.98<br />Sen notes the intimate relationship between the temples, merchant <br />guilds,<br />Brahman communities and the Chola rulers, and how the Chola rulers <br />frequently turned<br />over conquered regions to Brahman communities for developmental <br />purposes, and that<br />these communities then involved the merchant guilds in temple <br />construction.99 This idea<br />continued that of Meera Abraham, who noted that the intimate links <br />among the Chola<br />state, merchant guilds, and religious institutions was one of <br />the "vital elements of the<br />C?la state synthesis of the eleventh century."100 Abraham in turn <br />drew much from earlier<br />studies by Nilakanta Sastri.101<br />The conquest of southern Karnataka by the Chola ruler R?j?ndra in <br />1032, for<br />example, appears to have been aimed at securing internal trade <br />routes in southern India<br />for the Tamil merchant guilds. At the same time, there seems little <br />doubt that the Chola<br />attacks waged on Southeast Asia port polities in 1025 and again in <br />the 1070s, as well as<br />the occupation of Sri Lanka in 1080, were all intended to expand the <br />commercial interests<br />of the polity's merchants and thereby of the polity itself.102 The <br />commercial towns of the<br />Chola polity appear to have reached a zenith between the late 12th <br />and mid-13th, possibly<br />as a result of the wealth realised through these overseas markets.<br />It also appears that the Chola-China links reached a zenith about <br />the same time.<br />records the<br />Chinese-sponsored pagoda at Nagapattinam which bore an inscription <br />in Chinese noting<br />that it was completed in the equivalent of 1267. This was balanced <br />by a Tamil temple in<br />Quan-zhou dated by inscription to 1281, suggesting quite a community <br />of Tamils in the<br />city during this period of effervescence.103<br />The trade between the ports of South China and the Chola polity is <br />also evidenced by<br />the 11-12th century Chinese ceramic remains found widely in Sri <br />Lanka and Tamil<br />Nadu.104 Classical Chinese texts also inform us that the Chinese <br />obtained all of their<br />pepper from Indian ports, and there was obviously a strong trade in <br />textiles travelling<br />both ways.105<br />Tansen Sen suggests that, "In fact, Tamil merchant guilds may have <br />been as active on<br />the Sino-Indian circuit of Indian Ocean commerce as were there Arab <br />counterparts. More<br />importantly, however, the coastal region of India and Northern Sri <br />Lanka under Chola<br />rule provided a well-organised trading mechanism through which <br />commodities could<br />flow from China, on the one end of the global market, to the Persian <br />Gulf and<br />Mediterranean ports on the other."106 While it is true that most of <br />the maritime merchants<br />travelling into China bore names which can be reconstructed as <br />Islamic, we have no<br />knowledge as to the degree to which Tamil Muslim converts continued <br />to trade along the<br />routes and possibly through the same guilds which the earlier Hindu <br />merchants had done.</p>

<p>10. Maritime Trade related Warfare<br />It has been suggested that, following the emergence of Angkor in the <br />9th century,<br />the was frequent conflict with Champa was predominantly over access <br />to China trade<br />products and control of ports (remembering that much of what is <br />today the southern<br />Vietnamese coast was at this time subject to the Khmer polity of <br />Angkor).<br />In the Straits of Malacca, attacks on Srivijaya were initiated by <br />Java in the 10th<br />century and then by the Cholas in the 11th century. The important <br />location of the polity on<br />the maritime trade routes was undoubtedly what induced these attacks.</p>

<p>By the late 11th century, envoys to Song China were paid for their <br />goods in copper<br />coin and silver bullion, and no longer in the gold, silver or copper <br />objects previously<br />provided. 35 Such payments/rewards were provided to, for example, <br />missions from<br />Champa (1072 and 1086), an Arab polity (1073), the Chola polity <br />(1077), and Srivijaya<br />(1078).</p>

<p>Hi rahul, refer below paper, Mr Rao is still doing research on this <br />thread....</p>
<p>The Shipping Technology of Cholas</p>
<p>K.V. Ramakrishna Rao B.Sc., M.A., A.M.I.E., C.Eng. (I )., B.L.</p>
<p>Introduction: Of late, some researchers[1] have started throwing <br />doubt<br />on the overseas expedition of Rajaraja Chola through Rajendra Chola <br />on<br />the plea that the Parasasti / Meikkirti could have been written with<br />poetic fantasy rather than the factual accuracy. Even, had Rajendra<br />Cholan gone there, it could have been only a raid to loot and not to <br />set<br />foot as a conqueror! Earlier Aidan Southhall[2] analyzed the West<br />African politics in terms of the "segmentary states theory" and<br />applied to medieval European states. Burton Stein[3] applied such <br />model<br />to South India, though Bernard S. Cohn[4] opposed. Burton, then <br />applied<br />such theory to Cholas and George W. Spencer[5] accepting it to <br />declare<br />that in such "segmentary states", the state's functions were<br />custodial rather than regulative, magico-ritualistic rather than<br />managerial. Thus Cholas resorted to the policy of "plunder and<br />piety" just like Frankish kings of early mediaeval Europe. Rajaraja<br />too fulfilled his charitable obligations ? his "necessary<br />giving" ? in an extravagant way, aggressively acquiring booty<br />only to donate more lavishly to temples and Brahmans. In such an<br />attempt, the Tanjore inscriptional details of Cholas expedition to <br />South<br />East Asian Countries are dubbed as mere rhetoric. All these continue,<br />though R. C. Majumdar[6] after discussing the "struggle between the<br />Silendras and the Cholas", long back pointed out, "That the<br />story of this victory is not merely an imagination of the court-<br />poets,<br />but based on facts, is proved, beyond doubt, by the detailed <br />references<br />to the vassal states. It is interesting to note that many of these<br />States are included in the Silendra Empire by later Chinese<br />authorities".</p>
<p>Though, non-Indian researchers point out the maritime activities[7],<br />international trade, import and export of goods, movement of<br />people-groups with religious beliefs[8] etc., their studies have been<br />restricted to Chinese, Arabic and European exploits or impact with<br />passing remarks to Indians and Cholas. Accepting the fact of Indian<br />goods, people, their religion, temple-building technology etc., going<br />there, but doubting their mode of travel appears illogical and<br />unhistorical. Therefore, a critical study is made in this paper to<br />analyze the shipping, ship-building and naval capabilities of the<br />Cholas.</p>
<p>Whether Naval battles were fought or not?: The core is dealt with The<br />concept of oversea expedition and conquer is linked with Naval <br />battles<br />so that the incoming warriors from the ships land and enter into <br />cities<br />so that the conquest is complete. The critical observations made by<br />different researchers are mentioned as follows:</p>
<p>George W. Spencer[9]: "In spite of several references in Tanjore<br />record to ships and bodies of water, there is nothing in those purely<br />rhetorical references that requires us to believe that Cholas fought<br />naval battles. Indeed, the equally conventional reference to <br />capturing<br />the Kedah elephants would suggest land battles".</p>
<p>Moti Chandra[10] succinctly describes the Cholas expedition to SEA<br />concluding as follows: "In the conquests of Rajendra Chola came<br />almost the whole eastern part of Sumatra, and the central and <br />southern<br />parts of the Malay peninsula. He also occupied the capitals of <br />Srivijaya<br />and Kedah. Perhaps this expedition started in 1025 A.D".<br />Significantly, in next the line, he poses the issue:</p>
<p>"The Indian literature does not mention many sea battles. Therefore,<br />we are surprised to read the description of an Indian fleet in<br />Tilakamanjari[11] of Dhanapala[12]. The story mentions that this <br />Indian<br />fleet was led by an Indian prince, Samaraketu of Rangasala. He led <br />this<br />expedition to Indonesia because the feudatory chiefs there refused to<br />pay the tributes and taxes in time????.". Surprised by the<br />close similarity between the narration about Cholas naval expedition <br />and<br />the Tilakamanjari story, he notes:</p>
<p>"Whether the sea expedition described in the Tilakamanjari gives<br />glimpses of the victorious expedition of Rajendra Chola, or some <br />other<br />Indian ruler, depends on the exact date of Dharmapala. But, there is<br />hardly any doubt that Dhanapala had an intimate knowledge of<br />Indonesia". Then, he gives a free translation of the story, which<br />narrates as to how the army encamped on the shore, the soldiers <br />marched<br />to the villages, the Indonesian prince meeting the pilot, who was a <br />very<br />clever navigator and did not care for any sea danger, usage of boats<br />while disembarking etc., Thus. The text uses many expressions <br />related to<br />naval expedition. Then , Moti Chandra discusses about hero-stones <br />that<br />depict naval battles ending with A. S. Atlekar's reference[13] to<br />"flotilla of ships". P. C. Chakravarti[14] has dealt with<br />"Navak Warfare in Ancient India", in 1930, particularly pointing<br />out the Naval capabilities of the Tamils.</p>
<p>K. V. Raman[15], in the context, just points out the Cholas' trade<br />relation with China and SEA countries without going into the naval<br />aspect. P. Venkatesan[16], though deals with "Naval Battles and<br />Shipwrecks Referred to in Tamil Epigraphs", he repeats the details<br />from the inscriptions of Rajaraja and Rajendra, again not explaining<br />about naval details. But, there have been depiction of ships not <br />only in<br />hero-stones, but also on the coins of Satavahanas, Salankayanas,<br />Pallavas and others and such coins are in fact known as<br />"ship-type" coins.</p>
<p>"Ship-type Coins" Of Sathavahanas, Salankayanas, Kurumbas,<br />Pallavas: The introduction of "ship-type coins" has been<br />attributed to the Sathavahanas[17], who were ruling the south during<br />c.200 BCE onwards, just touching the northern boundaries of the <br />Tamils<br />of the Sangam period. Vasishthiputra Pulumavi and Yajna Sri Satakarni<br />have issued Ship-type coins depicting two-mast ships sailing on wavy<br />oceanic waters under partially clouded sky. The coins of Pulumavi <br />have<br />been recovered between Madras and Caddalore proving the existing of<br />ports in that area. The coins of the latter were found in Maharastra.<br />Here, under the two-mast ship fish (LHS) and conch (RHS) are also<br />depicted. The other parts of ship ? have also been clear. The<br />Salankayanas have also issued similar coins proving that they too had<br />seafaring activities and naval dominance. Interestingly, their ships<br />portray some parts of the ship on both sides under water. Though, <br />they<br />could be easily interpreted as oars, but the shapes negate it. In<br />another coin, a roughly circular shape object attached to one side of<br />the ship. Then come the ship-type coins issued by the Pallavas[18],<br />which depict both one-mast and two-mast ships and also single-mast <br />boat<br />with Nandi / bull symbol on the observe. The picture nos. are given <br />as<br />appearing in the book of R. Krishnamurthy[19] for convenience. In the<br />coins with sl.nos. 25 and 26, the oars are very clear. No.35 also <br />shows<br />two-mast ship. In 36, part of a ship is depicted with a lengthy <br />devise<br />underneath with three rectangular scooped out holes. It could not be <br />an<br />anchor, as it has been depicted with full length of the ship.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Elliot[20] gives interesting description for the two-mast<br />ship depicted in Pallava coin: "Two-mast ship like the modern<br />coasting vessel or d'honi, steered by means of oars from the<br />stem". About this ship-type coins, he records that there were two<br />and both were found missing and then, one recovered. In his words<br />[21],<br />"This is one of the two coins mentioned on p.36, supposed to have<br />been lost. It was discovered in arranging the present series, but the<br />other is still missing" (1884). In another Pallava coin (numbered as<br />55 in plate II), he comments that observe has `a horse facing right,<br />with a pellet in front' and reverse `indistinct'. But, the<br />reverse depict a two-decked ship, perhaps which he did not want to<br />acknowledge, as it would be too modern to be imagined in the Pallava<br />period! In fact, he calls them as "Kurumbas". These coins were<br />recovered from the coastal Labis and Merkayars in exchange for useful<br />necessaries. About the coins, he describes as follows[22]:</p>
<p>"Those of native origin are small, irregularly rounded pieces of<br />thin copper, bearing generally the device of a bull, with <br />occasionally<br />some letters in Cave-character on the observe; and on the reverse, a<br />tree, ship, star, crab, fish etc. but, their most remarkable<br />characteristic is the elegance and delicacy of form with which the<br />animals are designed, indicating a considerable advance of art; and <br />in<br />this respect contrasting favourably, but with the Andhra money on the<br />one side, and with the Chola, and Pandyan currencies on the other"<br />(emphasis added).</p>
<p>Thus, he could have noted the similarity of coins of Cholas and <br />Pandyas,<br />besides Andhras and Kurumbas, as implied in his argument of contrast <br />of<br />art. Coming to Cholas of the material period, the available / <br />reported<br />coins depict only stars, fish prominently (these are specifically<br />mentioned in the context). Therefore, it is intriguing to note that<br />there are no coins issued by Rajaraja or Rajendra either to <br />commemorate<br />their oversea expeditions or victories or at least depict their naval<br />capabilities on their coins. When so many metallurgical highly <br />skilled<br />bronzes are attributed to the Cholas, it is also intriguing that they<br />issued fewer coins. But, considering the disappearance of coins from<br />India[23], it can be surmised that such coins could have gone to the<br />foreigners (just like Leiden Copper plates) and in the possession of<br />private collection (Indian coins are offered for sale in internet).</p>
<p>Revenue System proves the Maritime activities of Cholas: The Revenue<br />system of the Cholas interestingly talks about duty on imported goods<br />into their territories. The South Indian Inscriptions have given <br />enough<br />details about it. It is unique in the sense that the levy was imposed<br />based on the type of the vessel in which the goods were imported or<br />imported goods brought in instead of the goods imported. Thus, the <br />levy<br />is mentioned for the following:</p>
<p>? Marakkalam = Ship</p>
<p>? Patavu = Boat</p>
<p>? Kalavam = Raft</p>
<p>P. Shanmugam[24] dealing with the topic notes that. ".. a similar<br />tax imports are mentioned in an epigraoph of Ganapatideva (1244). We<br />have no such evidence to suggest a corresponding item in CM<br />(Cholamandalam)". That is, the dilemma implied is that the<br />inscriptions mentioning the three type of naval tax levied are found<br />only in Tondaimandalam and not in Cholamandalam, but such division <br />has<br />been conceived, perceived and applied by us only. It is well known <br />that<br />such import-export, naval-maritime, shipping-shipbuilding activities<br />would be near sea and not interior areas under the Cholas. Therefore,<br />such inscriptions located near sea, here, Kollitturai, are <br />significant.</p>
<p>The Navy (of Cholas): Under the caption "The Navy", K. A.<br />Nilakanta Sastri[25] has given the following details and they split <br />into<br />points for interpretation as follows:</p>
<p>? The `numberless ship' which carried Rajendra's troops<br />across the `rolling sea' to the conquest of Sri Vijaya and its<br />dependencies could not have come up suddenly and must be accepted as<br />proof of a steady naval policy pursued by the Cola monarchs of the<br />period.</p>
<p>? The steady naval policy pursued by the Cola monarchs of the<br />period could not have been without the knowledge of ship-building,<br />ship-technology and shipping.</p>
<p>? The early Colas of the Sangam period had a good share in the<br />maritime trade and activity of the Indian seas.</p>
<p>? So such "naval policy" had been continuous and not<br />originated suddenly. Thus, the Colas of Sangam period must have had<br />ruled like their contemporary Satavahanas, as otherwise, it is<br />unimaginable or intriguing to note Satavanas ruling states and the <br />Colas<br />without state reportedly leading "tribal state", as has already<br />been suggested by some historians[26].</p>
<p>? The history of the Hindu colonies in the Malay Archipelago and<br />Indo-China gives clear evidence of a steady increase, under the<br />Pallavas, in the trade and culture contacts between these lands and <br />the<br />countries of South India.</p>
<p>? Thus, the Pallavas navigation technology goes before the Colas in<br />the seafaring actrivities. B. Ch.Chabra[27] has pointed out as to how<br />the Pallava inscriptions of non-Indian sources (available in SEA<br />countries) are dating before the Indian Pallavas. Thus, the overseas<br />trade and shipping of Pallavas cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>? The Tamil inscriptions of Takuapa53 shows that an important<br />mercantile corporation of South India, the manigramam, had <br />established<br />itself on the opposite coast of the Bay of Bengal in the ninth <br />century<br />A.D.</p>
<p>? Now, there have been many inscriptions found even upto<br />Southern-China and they are discussed separately.</p>
<p>? The Colas only continued an ancient tradition in the attention<br />they gave to developing their power on the sea. The conquest of <br />Ceylon<br />and the Maldives, and the evidence of the Chinese annals o the <br />embassies<br />that reached China in the period from the Cola country give us some<br />measure of the success they attained in this direction.</p>
<p>? The literary evidences of Sangam literature and the conquest of<br />Ceylon and Maldives had been prelude to their overseas expansion.</p>
<p>? And the overthrow of the Cera fleet at Kandalur salai may well be<br />taken to mark the definite establishment of Cola naval power in this<br />period in the territorial waters of Southern India. We have little<br />direct evidence on the build of the ships employed.</p>
<p>? Though about the "overthrow of the Cera fleet at Kandalur<br />salai" is interpreted differently, the fact being that not only<br />Colas had maritime capabilities, the Ceras too possessed such<br />capabilities with their unique ship-building and ship-academy.</p>
<p>? Considering that the author of the periplus distinguished three<br />types of vessels several centuries earlier on the Coromandel coast <br />and<br />that naval expedition of Rajendra was a great achievement in itself, <br />the<br />existence of a well-ordered fleet comprising ships and boats of<br />different grades must be admitted.</p>
<p>? Of course, the "civilized, progressed and advanced"<br />Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs and others would not have been <br />dealing<br />with "mythical goods" of Indians and the latter sailing in<br />"mythical ships".</p>
<p>? The Arab merchant Sulaiman made several voyages between China and<br />the Persian Gulf in the ninth century A.D., at a time when this long<br />distance trade was being carried on very briskly. In his curious <br />account<br />of Maldives, he says that the people of these islands `built ships<br />and houses and executed all other works with a consummate art'54.</p>
<p>? The mention of Maldives is interesting as it was stronghold of<br />Pallavas once and they were building ships and supplying to others.</p>
<p>? Sulaiman had no occasion to visit the Coromandel coast; and his<br />voyages were made before the rise of Colas of the Vijayala line into<br />prominence. Taking into account Sulaiman's testimony to the quality<br />of the ships built in Maldives, and the conquest of these islands<br />effected by Rajaraja's fleet, we may form some idea of the<br />efficiency of Cola navy in this period.</p>
<p>? Rather, the Colas tried to imitate the Pallavas in dealing first<br />with the "Pallavas" of Maldives and then Ceras (Kanthalur<br />salai). In any case, the ship-connection (ship-building and<br />ship-academy) is interesting.</p>
<p>? Abu Zaid Hasan, in the notes which he added to Sulaiman's work<br />about the beginning of the tenth century A.D., observes that the <br />vessels<br />of the Indian ocean, specially those made at Saraf, differed in<br />construction from those of the Mediterranean. `It is a fact that the<br />type of ship built by pieces of wood sewn together is a specially of <br />the<br />builders of Siraf, the ship builders of Syria and of Rum (Byzantum)<br />nail, on the contrary, these pieces of wood and never sew them one to<br />another'55.</p>
<p>? Zaid observation of "sewn Indian ships" must be general,<br />in otherwords that the Indian ships were built in such a way that the<br />joints could not be seen buty appeared as if the wooden planks / <br />parts<br />were sewn together with wooden nails.</p>
<p>? Today we can see boats on the maras coast with planks<br />`sewn' together by threads of cocoanut fibre. But these are<br />usually of a small size; and the observations of Abu Zaid based on <br />what<br />he saw and heard at Siraf about A.D., 916 on navigation in the Indian<br />Ocean56 should be no obstacle to a just estimate of the size and<br />importance of the navy of the Cola empire more than a century later. <br />If<br />the Arab writers are too early, Marco Polo comes unfortunately too <br />late,<br />and we are without a good contemporary account of ship-building on <br />the<br />Coromandel coast under the Colas.</p>
<p>? Again , this is generalized observation. What used on the Maras<br />coast are boats, but what is discussed here are ships. Therefore, the<br />shipbuilding technology varies accordingly.</p>
<p>? Ahmad-ibn Majid, an Arab writer of the fifteenth century and<br />author of several nautical works, makes frequent allusion to the<br />opinions of the Cholas which he approves or modifies. He must have <br />had<br />before him a specilised nautical literature of Tamil (Cola) origin <br />which<br />he compared with Arab documents of a like nature.</p>
<p>? He must be having Indian books on Shipbuilding etc., for example,<br />Kappal Sattiram (the science of ships), Navai Sattram (The <br />Technology of<br />Shipbuilding). When he tried to write without mentioning the sources,<br />naturally, opinion was bound to change because of borrowed ideas.<br />Copying technology is different from understanding science behind it.</p>
<p>? This literature must have included geographical tables with<br />indications of the latitudes of ports for use of the mariners of the<br />Coromandel coast57.</p>
<p>? Yes, H. B. Sarkar[28] has proved from the sources that the Arabs<br />freely used Indian tables, but circulated them as if they were <br />authors.<br />Baitul Hikmah of Harun-al-Rashid (785-809), and the works attributed <br />to<br />Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (919-921), al-Ishtkhri (934), Ibn Hawqal (c.980),<br />al-Muqaddasi (985), Abdul Fida, Sidi Ali (d.1562) etc., prove the <br />fact.</p>
<p>? Of this technical literature mentioned by this Arab writers,<br />unfortunately no part seems to have survived.</p>
<p>? Naturally, as pointed out, the Arabs destroyed the Indian<br />originals and circulated their version as their own without any<br />acknowledgement to Indians. And there was no respect for intellectual<br />honesty or intellectual property, rights and so on, which we talk <br />about<br />nowadays!</p>
<p>could<br />be known:</p>
<p>? The navy possessed by the Cholas.</p>
<p>? Their seafaring capabilities.</p>
<p>? Their oversea expedition to SEA countries.</p>
<p>? Arabs testimony to Cholas presence even in the West, besides East<br />(SEA Countries).</p>
<p>The Naval expeditions of Cholas mentioned in the Inscriptions: A<br />detailed account of overseas expedition undertaken by Rajaraja <br />through<br />his son and Commander-cum-Captain has been recorded in the <br />inscriptions<br />as "Meikirti", where certain description, expression and words<br />point to Oceanic, maritime and naval details and they are discussed <br />as<br />follows:</p>
<p>That the "மெய்க்கீர்த்தி /<br />Meikkirti" references of the following description of the oversea<br />exploitations imply the science and technology behind:</p>
<p>? காந்தளூர் சாலை<br />கலமறுத்து[29] = He checked / controlled the<br />College of Marine Shipping and Military Academy at Kanthalur, as the<br />Chera King was building ships and selling to Arabs and Europeans and <br />all<br />in turn were acting against the interests of the Cholas. The Chera <br />King<br />perhaps, refused or stopped sending ships required by the Chola <br />Empire.<br />Some take the literal meaning of கலமறுத்து as<br />destroying ships, but in the context, it is incongruent and <br />meaningless,<br />as he could not have destroyed, therefore he must have seized the <br />ships<br />meant for Arabs or Europeans, instead of offering to Cholas.</p>
<p>? முந்நீர்ப்<br />பழந்தீவு<br />பன்னீராயிரம் = the expression<br />முந்நீர் has been frequently used in the ancient<br />Tamil literature from Tolkappiyam and therefore, its usage in <br />historical<br />context has been very significant and its identification with <br />Maldives<br />has been more significant. That the Pallava inscriptions and <br />sculptures<br />have been found in Maldives proves the Tamil connection dating back <br />to<br />3rd cent.CE. Again, interestingly, Maldives play role in supplying<br />cowries (used in astronomy) and as coinage and ships to India ? that<br />were build with wooden planks sewn together).</p>
<p>? கடலிடங் காவலன் = the<br />Protector or Lord of places of Ocean (implying ports, port cities and<br />coastal areas). This title is followed by the titles of Narapati,<br />Aswapati, Gajapati etc. Moreover, the conquered places mentioned in <br />the<br />SEA countries happened to be coastal cities or ports. Therefore, <br />where<br />his influence was felt and hence, known as so.</p>
<p>? கடல்புக வெகுண்டு =<br />He was angered because of the entering of oceanic waters (implying <br />some<br />sort of Tsunami / deluge occurred)</p>
<p>? பொரு கடல் ஈழம் = Ezham<br />situated in the attacking oceanic waters</p>
<p>? தெண்டிரை ஈழம் = Ezham situated<br />in the cold / southern oceanic waters.</p>
<p>? நெடுங்கடல்<br />உத்தரலாடம் = the place to be reached by<br />traveling a long distance in the north of ocean.</p>
<p>? அலைகடல் நடுவுட்<br />பலகலஞ் செலுத்தி = he steered<br />his fleet through the wavy ocean. It is mentioned in the context of<br />Kadaram.</p>
<p>? ஆழ் கடல் சூழ் = the wavy<br />oceanic waters surrounding "Mayirudingam" or Ji-lo-ting as<br />mentioned by the Chinese.</p>
<p>? நிறைபுனல் = brimming estuary. It is<br />mentioned connecting Mapappalam located in the Isthmus of Kra.</p>
<p>? தொடுகடற் காவற்<br />கடமுரட் = the oceanic water touching and well<br />protected. Again it is mentioned in the context of Kadaram. The extra<br />word used denotes the confronting nature of Kadaram with the Cholas.</p>
<p>Here, each word or expression has to be taken in the maritime context<br />instead of appreciating the literary nuance to dub it as a rhetoric.<br />This description has been doubted by researchers as pointed out <br />above.<br />But, considering the description correlating with other evidences, <br />the<br />shipping and navigational skills of Cholas cannot be mythologized.</p>
<p>Inscriptions found in the SEA Countries and China[30]: Significantly,<br />inscriptions in mainly Tamil and Tamil bilingual (Tamil with <br />Sanskrit,<br />SEA languages like Thai, and Chinese) have been found in SEA <br />Countries<br />and Eastern China. They are tabulated as follows:</p>

<p>Cross-checking with Local literature of SEA: H. B. Sarkar[31] after<br />discussing about the so-called "Leiden grant" of Rajaraja Chola<br />(980-1014) delves upon the inscriptional evidences of the Cholas, <br />which<br />asset the conquest of Kadaram even by Virarajendra Cola (1069-1070),<br />implying that the movement of Cholas or representatives of Cholas had<br />been there for nearly 100 years from Rajaraja to Rajendra reign. <br />Quoting<br />Tibbets[32], Sarkar points out that Cholas knew SEA more than the <br />Arabs,<br />as Idrisi could add only two names in the geographical data on<br />South-East Asia: these are Karimata and al-Anam. Joustra[33] pointed <br />out<br />Tamil names in central Sumatra: Coliya, Pandia, Meliyala and Tekang,<br />thus clearly referring to Cola, Pandya, Malayala and the Deccan. Ma<br />Tuan-lin[34] records about the Chu-lien mission to China reaching <br />there<br />in 1025. Then, he mentions about one text Nagarakritagama is an<br />old-Javanese literary work (dated to 1365). The text was discovered <br />from<br />Bali in 1894, translated and published later. In this work, the Colas<br />are designated as Coda or Gauda. It mentions the places which were<br />raided by the soldiers of Rajendra Cola as Kampar, Kampe, Haru, <br />Parlak,<br />Samudra etc., (Nagar.13. 1-2). The local stories, particularly, the<br />story of Manimekhalai show similarity. Of course, the art and<br />architecture prove the Indian influence, which is too well known to <br />be<br />repeated here.</p>
<p>The Astronomy of Chola Period: The Shipping, navigation and <br />astronomy go<br />together. Rajaraja encouraged astronomy and there was Colleges<br />exclusively at important cities like Madurai, Tanjai and<br />Trichirappalli[35]. Incidentally, there was an astronomer hailing <br />from<br />Gagnaikonda Cholapuram, which is mentioned as Gangapuri, Gangapura <br />and<br />Sriranga-gangapuri (Epigraphgica Indica xv, p.49) with prefix Sri-<br />ranga<br />(the stage of goddess of prosperity). His name was Suryadeva[36] and<br />also known as Suryadeva Yajva, Suryadeva Somasut and Suryadeva <br />Dikshita<br />(c.1191- 1260 CE). He was born on Monday, 3rd that of the dark half <br />of<br />Magha, Saka 1113 (= 1191 CE). The ahargana for that day, according to<br />Aryabhata-siddhanta was 15,68,004, i.e, so may days elapsed since<br />Kaliyuga. So dividing 15,68,004 by 365.25, we get 4293. Subtracting<br />3102, we get 1191 (4293-3102=1191), this tallies with the year <br />obtained<br />based on Saka era 1113+78=1191 (विशवेशमित 1113<br />शकेमागकृशण). He was a Brahmin with Nidhruva<br />gotra belonging to the Chola country and a resident of Gangaikonda<br />Cholapuram and thus, evidently patronized by the Chola Kings. <br />Rajendra<br />Chola (1012-1044) founded the city to commemorate his victory over<br />Ganges campaign. Probably, Somadeva Yajva's forefathers had been<br />with the Cholas and he could be the Royal Astronomer he was the<br />Principal of the Astronomical College (Vidhyalaya) in the Chola<br />territories interacting with others. This all of sudden could not <br />have<br />come into existence. Referring to Post-Sangam literature, we come <br />across<br />Civaga Cintamani (dated to 9th-10th centuries, verse no.995) <br />mentioning<br />existence of Colleges as follows:</p>
<p>கலத்தற் காலங்<br />கல்லூரி</p>
<p>When time comes (after primary education), the youth are admitted to<br />College (for higher studies). Thus, the mention of<br />கல்லூரி is very interesting and significant to prove<br />the well-established educational system in the Tamizhagam during<br />9th-10th centuries.</p>
<p>Thus, Professor Somadeva Yajvan must have been teaching and <br />researching<br />there. He has written commentaries on the following works:</p>
<p>6 Aryabhatiya (c.500).</p>
<p>6 Mahayatra of Varahamihira (c.500)</p>
<p>6 Laghumanasa of Majula (c.932).</p>
<p>6 Jataka-paddhathi of Sripati (c.1039)</p>
<p>His commentary on Sripati proves that the Indian astronomers were in<br />touch with each other discussing on the subject matter dealt with.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the forefathers of Suryadeva or their disciples must <br />have<br />accompanied with Rajendra during his overseas campaigns. Thus, during<br />the Chola period, the knowledge of geography accompanied with<br />cartography must have been there, as otherwise, Rajendra chola could <br />not<br />have navigated and directed his ships exactly going to the respective<br />countries, carried the campaign by landing on the shores respective<br />cities of the countries after anchoring. He must have used small <br />boats<br />to reach the shores. After campaign, he must have come back to his <br />ship<br />and started sailing after de-anchoring. This proves that Cholas were<br />having maps of India accompanied with the South East countries. <br />However,<br />it is intriguing and surprising to note none of the maps are <br />available<br />or reported in possession of anybody.</p>
<p>Civaga Cintamani (verse no. 882) mentions about the existence of<br />"books on the knowledge of Oceans", which is very significant in<br />the context:</p>
<p>வாண் மின்னு வண்கை<br />வடிநூற் கடற்கேள்வி<br />மைந்தர்</p>
<p>தான்மின்னு வீங்கு<br />கழலான்றனைச்<br />சுழமற்றப்</p>
<p>பூண்மின்னு மார்பன்<br />பொலிந்தாங்கிருந்தான்<br />விசும்பிற்</p>
<p>கோன்மின்னு மீன்சூழ்<br />குளிர்மாமதித்<br />தோற்றமொத்ததே.</p>
<p>The brothers are having hands which are well-versed in the handling <br />of<br />glittering swords and as well as well-written books on Oceans (The<br />sailors of all categories ? traders, businessmen, should be warriors<br />and also good navigators with the knowledge of shipping, astronomy,<br />geography and oceanography). As Civaga, the hero is encircled with <br />his<br />brothers shining, the cool Moon is also encircled with other planets <br />and<br />asterism (visible clearly during the night, as could be observed by <br />them<br />on the ship during their voyage, i.e, the knowledge of stellar<br />navigation is also a must for them).</p>
<p>6 The mention of availability of books on the knowledge of <br />Oceans<br />is significant.</p>
<p>6 "The Books on the Knowledge of Oceans" covers all<br />aspects of Ships, shipping etc.,</p>
<p>6 That the sailors should be capable of handling swords and <br />such<br />books is also significant considering the dangers involved in<br />ocean-trade, visiting many countries, the nature of peopled dealt <br />with<br />in trading etc.</p>
<p>6 Interestingly, both the Science of Ocean and the Sky are<br />mentioned together in the same context figuratively.</p>
<p>The Astronomical link among the SEA countries and India: The Siamese<br />[37]<br />and Tiruvalore[38] astronomical tables created a great storm in the<br />Europe making the mathematicians, astronomers and scientists to study<br />them to find out the accuracy[39], as they reportedly had <br />calculations<br />starting from Kaliyuga that started coinciding with a planetary<br />conjunction or alignment that occurred around 3102 BCE[40]. The <br />movement<br />of Cholas, particularly, Somadeva Yajvan with Rajendra to SEA <br />countries<br />could be a source for the spread of such knowledge. Moreover,<br />historically, the entire area was known as "India" according to<br />the middle-east and European people, as is evident from their <br />writings<br />and maps[41]. The flooding of Jesuits to Siam attacking Royal<br />palaces[42], infiltrating temples and Buddhist Viharas and <br />researching<br />the scholars for astronomical, geographical and medical manuscripts<br />speak the motive[43]. The movements of selected Jesuits from Cochin <br />and<br />Goa to China and back[44], SEA countries and back to Pondicherry,<br />Tranqubar etc., prove their collection of scientific and technical<br />manuscripts, tables, charts and materials.</p>
<p>The Disappearance of Indian Astronomical documents, instruments and<br />maps: Like the details of Indian shipping, the astronomical <br />documents,<br />instruments and maps are also surprisingly missing, though, usage of<br />them were there, as the naval expedition had been the proof. K. A.<br />Nilakanta Sastri's observation[45] made on Ahamad-ibn Majid are<br />interesting to note:</p>
<p>"Ahmad-ibn Majid, an Arab writer of the fifteenth century and author<br />of several nautical works, makes frequent allusion to the opinions of<br />the Cholas which he approves or modifiues. He must have had before <br />him a<br />specilised nautical literature of Tamil (Cola) origin which he <br />compared<br />with Arab documents of a like nature. This literature must have <br />included<br />geographical tables with indications of the latitudes of ports for <br />use<br />of the mariners of the Coromandel coast. of this technical literature<br />mentioned by this Arab writers, unfortunately no part seems to have<br />survived".</p>
<p>Ferrand26 in his writing has clearly pointed out as follows:</p>
<p>`Dans tous ses ouvrages nautiques, Ibn Majid fait frequemment<br />allusion'a l' opinion des Colas qu'il appropuve ou rectifie.<br />Ce'st qu'il devait avoir en main les Insructions nautiques<br />tables geographuques avec indication de la latitude des ports,<br />utilis'ees par les marins du Coromandel et qu'il les comparait<br />avee les documents arabes des meme nature'.</p>
<p>Therefore, the following questions arise:</p>
<p>? What were the allusions made about Cholas by Ahamad-ibn Majid?</p>
<p>? Why he approves or modifies such allusions?</p>
<p>? What was "a specilised nautical literature of Tamil (Cola)<br />origin" possessed by the Arabs?</p>
<p>? Why he compared Arab records with Tamil-Chola nauctiical<br />literature?</p>
<p>? After comparision, what he did with such "specilised nautical<br />literature of Tamil (Cola) origin"?</p>
<p>? If the "specilised nautical literature of Tamil (Cola)<br />origin" included "geographical tables with indications of the<br />latitudes of ports for use of the mariners of the Coromandel coast",<br />what happened to such geographical tables?</p>
<p>? K. A. N. Nilakanda Sastri could say only that, "Of this<br />technical literature mentioned by this Arab writers, unfortunately no<br />part seems to have survived".</p>
<p>More Evidences to prove that Indian maps were taken away: The <br />following<br />references are given to show the vulnerable condition of Indian<br />researchers, when most of the historical evidences are in the<br />collections of the foreigners, which are not easily accessible.<br />Encyclopedia Britannica (1952 edition) gives the following details<br />[46]:</p>
<p>"The charts in use by medieval navigators of the Indian ocean ?<br />Arab, Persians or Dravidians ? were in equal in value if not<br />superior to the charts of Mediterranean. Marco Polo (1292) mentions <br />such<br />charts; Vasco Da Gama (1498) found them in the hands of Indian pilot,<br />and their value is fully explained in the Mohit or encyclopedia of <br />the<br />sea compiled from ancient sources by the Turkish Admiral Sidi Ali Ben<br />Hosssein in 1554. These charts are covered with a close net work of<br />lines intersecting each other at right angles. The horizontal lines <br />are<br />parallels, depending upon the altitude of the pole star, the calves, <br />the<br />little Bear and the Barrow of the Great Bear above the horizon. This<br />altitude was expressed in "isbas" or inches each equivalent to<br />104'50". Each isba was divided into "Zams" or eights.<br />The interval between the parallels thus amounted to 12'51".<br />These intervals were mistaken by the Portuguese occasionally for<br />degrees, which accounted for Malacca, which is, in latitude 2013'N.<br />being placed on Cartino's chart (1502) in lat. 14'S. it may have<br />been a map of this kind which accounts for Ptolemy's moderate<br />exaggerations of the size of Toprobana (Ceylon). A fdirst meridian,<br />eparating a leeward from a windward region, passed through Ras Kumari<br />(Camorin) and was thus nearly identical with the meridian of the <br />Indian<br />astronomer which passed through the sacred city of Ujjain (Ozone of<br />Ptolemy) or the meridians of Azin of the Arabs. Additional meridians<br />were drawn at intervals of Zams, supposed to be equal to three hours<br />sail".</p>
<p>As the taking away or possession of such "specilised nautical<br />literature of Tamil (Cola) origin including geographical tables with<br />indications of the latitudes of ports for use of the mariners of the<br />Coromandel coast" by the Arabs was accepted, it is evident that they<br />compared, used and prepared tables and maps, but suppressed or <br />destroyed<br />the Indian originals. And we know lot of maps produced exactly during<br />that period onwards attribute to the Arab / Mohammedan / Muslim<br />geographers / cartographers and so on. This is just similar to the<br />Jesuits who took Indian books, instruments, charts, tables, samples <br />etc<br />on Indian science and technology. In any case, we have to show <br />evidences<br />for such happening. Here, comes the manuscript of "Kappal<br />Sattiram"[47].</p>
<p>Kappal Sattiram ? Science and Technology of Ships and Shipping:<br />Indians used to write books on Palm-leaves, particularly, in South<br />India. They used different scripts to Sanskrit and Tamil languages o<br />various subjects. Most of the original Sanskrit books are missing as<br />they must have been destroyed by the Mohammedans, taken away by the<br />Mohammedans for study and also by European missionaries. As the <br />demand<br />for books increased with the exigencies, more books could have been<br />produced engaging the scribes. An expression, "Tiruppugira<br />Pusthakam" found in "Kappal Sattiram" 37 (Science and<br />Technology of Ships and Shipping) proves that copies of books were <br />made<br />from the translations and as well as originals. The expressions "Edu<br />Tiruppudhal" (turning the pages) and "Tiruppugira Pusthakam"<br />(the book that is turned) convey copying a book from its original, so<br />that the original could be preserved and the copy given away or <br />sold. As<br />per the directions of the Danish, in the house of Kangirayap Pillai <br />or<br />Kalingarayap Pillai, a Dubash, the book was dictated and a scribe had<br />written down. The name of the book is mentioned as<br />"Nikamasigamani", a Sanskrit name. As the last line of 8th song<br />clearly mentions that, "Salaikathirangan sorppadi idanai tamil<br />seythittan", it is evident that as per the directions of one<br />Salaikathirangan, it was made into Tamil i.e, translated into Tamil <br />from<br />Sanskrit. As it was known that there was a work named "Nauka<br />Sastra" in Sanskrit, that book might have been used for translation.<br />Here, Kangiyap Pillai says that he is producing the book as per the<br />directions of Danish in 1620 (of Salivahana Era) or 1698 of CE in his<br />house. So the Danish used different tactics to get the science and<br />technology books from the Indians.</p>
<p>The book gives the following details (the author's comments are<br />given in different colour):</p>
<p>? The standard measurement is given (Verse.3).</p>
<p>? The time suitable for manufacture of ocean-going vessels is given<br />astronomically based on an earlier work, "Nigama Sigamani"<br />(நீகம சிகாமணி, Verse.4).</p>
<p>? The properties of ships (5).</p>
<p>? The suitable time for navigation is given (6-9).</p>
<p>? The best time for fixing of mast is given (13).</p>
<p>? A Tamil king "Parasi Vendan", who helps shipping<br />technology, is mentioned.</p>
<p>? When a ship could sail safely, when it might face with danger,<br />when a ship may wreck, and such other exigencies are mentioned (23-<br />28).<br />Thus, it is amply evident that the Tamils knew the ship wreckage<br />occurred as a result of piracy by non-Indians. As they followed the<br />rules and regulations of nature and sailed in the prescribed time, <br />the<br />wreckage due to natural disasters like tempest, cyclones, rough <br />weather<br />etc., must have been minimal.</p>
<p>? Mathematics involving points / dots is mentioned (29). As it is<br />not explained, it is not known exactly what mathematical method or<br />mathematics involving points was used in the maritime context. But, <br />it<br />must have been connected with Cartography making points on the maps<br />drawn, developed, corrected and modified. In those days, maps could <br />have<br />been produced only after undertaking any voyages. Ironically, such<br />projection in navigation charts used is known as the Mercator, named<br />after the Flemish mathematician and geographer Gerardus Mercator<br />(1512-94), who reportedly devised it. But it is evident that they <br />must<br />have known from Indians, as existence of such method is mentioned <br />here.</p>
<p>? Experts of Books without any weariness (31). It is mentioned that<br />these details are given by the Experts of Books without any weariness<br />implying that they exclusively engaged in such observatory and<br />cartographic work making projections etc.</p>
<p>? When the destruction of a ship with cargo would occur (33) is<br />mentioned.</p>
<p>? When a ship would return successfully with earned profits after<br />selling the goods aboard (37) is given. These two exigencies have <br />been<br />given in astrological interpretation, but involving astronomical<br />observation. The Tamils must have found out the arrival of Arab and<br />European vessels to SEA countries at a particular time, as their<br />starting with winds from their destinations had been different from <br />that<br />of Indians. However, they tried to coincide with the timings of <br />Indians<br />with an intention to compete initially and then seize cargo by piracy<br />realizing their law abiding nature. Moreover, the cunning Arabs and<br />Europeans must have used Indian flags, symbols, dress etc., to cheat<br />the Indians to complete their piracy.</p>
<p>? Persons with two eyes and one eye are compared figuratively with<br />Sun and Moon. Danger to cargo would come from the persons with one <br />eye<br />(39), as they stealthily attack other vessels without following any<br />marine-ethics or Maritime regulations. This is clear indication that<br />Tamils knew of the nature of pirates, who were not Indians, as they <br />were<br />not following the Indian ethics of not attacking the vessels of <br />others.<br />Incidentally, the western depiction of standard pirates have been<br />"one-eyed"!</p>
<p>? Interestingly, another point implied is about the persons with<br />"Surya dhristi", "Chandra dhristi", "Raja<br />dhristi", Griha dhristi", "Rakka dhristi" etc. They were<br />nothing but persons with eye-sight of Moon, Sun, King, Planets, sides<br />etc. in other words, the ocean going ships had such experts / <br />observers<br />of Solar, lunar, planetary motions and time calculations. As they <br />had to<br />visit different countries, they had to know about the Kings of such<br />countries, thus the experts of Kings. And there were experts in<br />observing directions also, as it is important in navigation. As such<br />things could have been possible with past experience, it is evident <br />that<br />the experts mentioned must have had books on such subject matter.</p>
<p>? Suddenly, the work changes from poetry to prose giving statistical<br />details of planets, asterisms, stars etc.</p>
<p>? Thus, the measurements for masts are given.</p>
<p>? The measurements for anchors are given.</p>
<p>? Measurement details of a "English ship" is given.</p>
<p>? At the end, it is appended with "Silpa sastram" (A Manual<br />of Sculpre) only with 13 verses.</p>
<p>? As most of the verses have been written with defective words,<br />language and grammar, it is evident that the Danish must have engaged<br />poor scribes to write this work, evidently to substitute, as the<br />original was taken away by them.</p>
<p>? Many verses have been adopted or imported straight away from the<br />following earlier works:</p>
<p>சரஸ்வதிஅந்தாதி</p>
<p>சோதிடகிரகசிந்தாமணி</p>
<p>கணக்கதிகாரம்</p>
<p>நீகம சிகாமணி</p>
<p>However, the scribe has not acknowledged the source.</p>
<p>? As the work has been incomplete in many aspects, it is evident<br />that the copy has been only a part of a bigger book.</p>
<p>"Navai Sattiram"[48]: It is only part of the original work, as<br />the available 64 leaf-book does not give more details that that of <br />the<br />above "Kappal Sattiram". Most of the available songs delve on<br />the auspicious time, date and period for start and return of journey<br />with astrological couch. In fact, same songs are repeated, however,<br />subject matter is concerned, it differs and at many places it is<br />incomplete and thus, there must have been complete book. <br />Particularly,<br />after discussing about the wooden planks used for mast, the verses <br />are<br />found to be with broken sentences. Therefore, the copyist must have<br />hurriedly copied from the original work. The crude drawing of a<br />three-mast ship also proves the fact, as in many other manuscripts, <br />very<br />good pictures with minute details have been drawn.</p>
<p>Piercing the veil of Buddhism: If the veil of Buddhism is pierced, <br />the<br />treatment of all Buddhists ? Indians, Chinese, Ceylonese, and SEA<br />categories alike, would be removed. The tracing of maritime trade<br />between the India and the ports Southern China to first centuries <br />points<br />to such a possibility. As Tamil Siddhas[49] have made their claimed<br />sojourns or voyages to China, Chinese have also done[50]. Haraprasad<br />Ray[51] has pointed out the links between India and China based on <br />the<br />Chinese records. Thus, as described by the Imperunkappiyangal, the <br />Tamil<br />and other Indian merchants had reached China, as evidenced by the<br />archaeological evidences of Quanzhou region. Tamil / South Indian<br />merchants had been there already in the Southeast Asia from the first<br />centuries. The Buddhist interpretation of events has made all people <br />to<br />appear as "Buddhists", but Indians of the whole region acted and<br />interacted together irrespective of their personal religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Thus, the oobservation of Tansen Sen[52] that,"some credit for the<br />`emergence of a world market' must go to the Chola (or Cola)<br />kingdom in Southern India. The trading ports and mercantile guilds of<br />the Chola kingdom, he suggests, played a significant role in linking <br />the<br />markets of China to the rest of the world" has been apt. The<br />movement of "Brahmanas and Sramanas" here had been phenomenal<br />along with other groups. As they already settled or colonized or<br />established themselves, their building activities had been natural<br />exhibiting in the material culture. Thus, the Pallava, Chola, <br />Silendra<br />and other influences are found in script, literature, sculpture and <br />art.</p>
<p>Indian Maritime Trade with Africa: The South Indian maritime trade <br />with<br />East African coastal countries during medieval period has been very<br />interesting and revealing throwing light on Pallava, Chola and <br />Kadamba<br />maritime trade and shipping. The movement of merchandise cargo from<br />south Indian ports through Maldives, Chagos for Archipelago, <br />Mauritius,<br />Reunion, Madagascar and coastal East Africa has been easiest the <br />South<br />Indian marine-traders[53]. Incidentally, these islands were used by <br />the<br />Pallava and Cholas for their ship-building activities. Pallava<br />sculptures, inscriptions and temples have been found in Maldives[54].<br />How the Pallavas could have exercised their influence far and wide<br />distances from SEA countries to East African coast could be noted <br />from<br />these archaeological evidences found in those places. During Pallava,<br />Chola and Kadamba period, the Indian metal workers had achieved <br />highest<br />state of art and their skill been a great demand throughout the <br />world.<br />In fact, before the advent of Islam, the movement of Indians to <br />Africa<br />had been very smooth without any maritime strife.</p>
<p>The finding of a bronze lion statuette[55] at trading port of Shanga,<br />Lamu District, Kenya, in January 1986 raised many questions. It has <br />been<br />dated to 1100 CE and compared with that of Central and South Indian<br />counterparts, because of close resemblances and casting techniques.<br />Moreover, the lion is easily comparable with the depiction noted on<br />South Indian coins also starting from 1st century BCE with<br />characteristic features. E. C. L. During Caspers[56] has pointed out<br />that the practice of trading bronze animals within the Indian Ocean<br />dates back to at least the 2nd millennium BC. Scientific analysis of <br />the<br />composition of bronzes found at Africa and South India and historical<br />evidence of maritime goods prove that either, Indians exported such<br />bronzes to Africa or the settled Indian metal workers created them.<br />Roger Summer[57] brought out the gold-mining techniques of Zimbabwe <br />had<br />been very similar to Deccan / South India. Hromnik pointed out that <br />the<br />Indians of Africa were also responsible for the introduction of <br />cattle<br />and crops, the stone architecture of Great Zimbanwe and by attracting<br />Negroid labouers to the south, for the Bantu migrations as well.</p>
<p>It may be noted that the vague references of Herodotus Indians <br />supplying<br />to "gold dust" and ferrum Indicum to the Persians and the Greeks<br />prove the metallurgical skill of Indians since c.1500 ? 300 BCE<br />period. The Bongozkai insprition already proved the Indian presence <br />in<br />the Mesopotamian area around c.1450 BCE. Thus, the fine casting<br />technology of Cholas could easily be correlated and corresponded with<br />the African specimens. Therefore, the South Indian history in the<br />context of metallurgy has to be recast with these metallurgical<br />evidences.</p>
<p>The findings[58] of Thor Heyerdahl, Prof. Arne Skj?lsvold and Prof.<br />Egil Mikkelsen have brought out the remains of a temple, Raksha-like<br />sculptures with Pallava-type inscription The local Maldive people<br />arrange shells in such a way, they look like a stupa - ruined <br />miniatures<br />of satihirutalu which formed the apex of the Maldive Buddhist <br />usthumbu.<br />The usthumbu has three parts: the quadrangular base representing <br />earth; the bell-shaped middle part, representing water; and the satihirutalu<br />representing <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym which crowns the usthumbu. The Buddhist stupa[59] <br />from<br />Kaiyuan Temple, adjacent to the site of the Quanzhou Maritime History<br />Museum resembles exactly like that of Maldive model. The pagoda spire<br />with lotus base of the stupa has striking resemblance with the <br />material<br />evidence and also that of Manimekhalai decription. Therefore, the<br />connection of Pallavas and Cholas with these areas is very visible.</acronym></p>
<p>The motive behind the conquests of Cholas: Considering maritime and<br />other activities, the maritime activities or the over-sea <br />expeditions /<br />conquests could be interpreted in their attempt to establish their<br />monopoly. Thus, many times scholars have expressed that they could <br />not<br />understand the motive behind the conquests, when all Kings had been<br />earning profits in over-sea trade. The conquest of southern<br />Karnatakadesa by Rajendra in 1032, has been definitely securing <br />internal<br />trade routes in southern India and as well as control the western <br />ports,<br />where Gujaratis and Arabs were dominating. Moreover, the left out <br />Cholas<br />could be considered as "Kadamas" by modern-day historians[60].<br />Kadambas had been so powerful on the western coast, that their <br />influence<br />was felt on the eastern African coast and middle east countries. They<br />had the title "The Lord of Western Ocean". Their inscription[61]<br />point to their maritime actrivities and authority over the western<br />ocean. Their fleet was so powerful that they could conquest many <br />islands<br />and lands as recorded in the inscriptions. The Nadukals <br />intrerestingly<br />depict the fleet, naval battles, and other minute details of ship<br />technolgy carved on them[62].</p>
<p>The conquest of Southeast Asia in 1025 and again in the 1070s, the<br />occupation of Sri Lanka in 1080 prove such dominating attempt. The<br />Chola-China commercial links reached at an appreciable level with the<br />exchange of missions with gifts. That the Chinese could build a <br />Vihara<br />at Nagapattinam proves the establishment of such relationship as <br />proved<br />by the Dao-yi zhi-lue account. The Chinese inscription found there<br />vouchsafes it. The Japanese scholars[63] pointed out he trade between<br />the ports of South China and the Cholas evidenced by the 11-12th <br />century<br />Chinese ceramic remains found in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. The <br />Classical<br />Chinese texts[64] and Siddhas poems convey that the Chinese obtained<br />pepper from Indian ports, and Indians mercury, certain chemicals etc<br />from China.</p>
<p>Conclusion: As seen, some scholars doubted the Chola inscriptions on <br />the<br />plea that they are rhetoric without going into the facts or<br />cross-checking the doubted claims with the local evidences of SEA<br />countries. Why the well-established Cholas could not have issued <br />coins<br />depicted their maritime excellence, while their predecessors<br />Sathavahanas, Salankyanas, Kurumbas, Pallavas could have issued<br />ship-type coins is not explained. As pointed out by Sir Walter Elliot<br />that ship-type Kurumba / Pallava coins could be obtained on exchange <br />of<br />necessities, what would have happened to other coins, had they been <br />paid<br />with valuables instead of necessities is not considered in the <br />context.<br />Incidentally, it has to be noted that the Tiruvalangadu Copper <br />plates,<br />ironically known as "Leiden grants" and most of the<br />"ship-type" coins have been now in possession of foreign<br />museums. Therefore, the fate of missing coins is not taken into<br />consideration.</p>
<p>As the material period 11th century had been dominated by Cholas,<br />Silendras and SEA powers within "Indian domain" and the Arabs<br />and Chinese playing with them, the Indian rulers could have been<br />exercising their influence only within their domains and crossed the<br />boundaries, when the powers of others declined. Therefore, the <br />theories<br />of "segmentary rule / power", "piety-plunder" etc.,<br />could not be applied by generalizations. The European medieval of<br />"Frankish plunder and distribution" is not applicable to Cholas.</p>
<p>That the Cholas granted tax-free lands to Brahmans only to pursue <br />their<br />astronomical activities, as has been vouchsafed by Suryadeva Yajvan, <br />as<br />astronomy helped the navigation and not to support their hegemony. In<br />fact, the work of Brahmins stopped with astronomical activities, as <br />the<br />navigational work and techniques were carried on by other <br />professional<br />groups. In fact, in such supposedly or assumed raidings and <br />plunderings,<br />only non-Brahmin groups had been evidently involved. Therefore, such<br />casteist interpretation would not help to decide the maritime <br />sojourns<br />effected by the Cholas.</p>
<p>The struggle between Silendras and Cholas in India and as well as the<br />rivalry among them with Chinese in SEA have resulted in some <br />documents,<br />particularly that of Chinese, which create wrong impression. In an<br />established governance and tax-collection, the raids, confiscation <br />and<br />other punitive punishments against tax evaders has been normal <br />feature<br />and it could not be interpreted as something unwarranted or <br />historically<br />unacceptable. Tribute payment is just like tax compliance. Thus, even<br />had the Cholas raided the tax evading Sri Vijaya, Cheras and Sri <br />Lankan,<br />that would fit to any democratic State governance. The circumstantial<br />and correlative evidences ? the literary evidences, the existence of<br />Naval architecture books, international trade, impost of tax on goods<br />imported through different types of vessels, rivalry among the <br />competing<br />national groups etc., have been normal feature and prove the oversea<br />expedition of the Cholas.</p>

<p>Hi rahul</p>
<p>If you dont beleive a kalvettu which is a public document ( wont you <br />be riddiculing yourself in front of your people if you inscribed these <br />false info) how would you beleive a private diary even if it were <br />there.the kalvettu and meikeerthis are the diaries. The towering <br />temples are their kolgai parapu seyal alars....i used to live in <br />besant nagar ...they were building the aru padai vedu kovil..and it <br />took them 12 years to get basic stone work done for the main shirnes <br />and later they had to do with cement structures.. compare this against <br />what was achieved by sembian madevi...the great lady, but hardly <br />anyone knows of her..run down a search on the temples she converted to <br />stone. i dont call cholas great for just what they did or tried doing <br />but for thinking big. to visualise, conceptualise something of such <br />great scale ...be it the big temple, be it <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  city, <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  campaign, <br />kadaram campaign...that is what made them great</acronym></p>

        <p>hi rahul</p>
<p>our archives have again revealed a gem..mssg # 4220. most of what we <br />discussed has already presented....beautiful work and some <br />intersting questions</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "ratnasabapathy_srihari" <br /><ratnasabapathy_srihari@...  wrote:</p>
<p>References to and the location of Palanthivukal:</p>
<p>Among the near overseas territories conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1<br />{A.D.985-1014} and Rajendra Chola - 1{A.D.1012-1044} other than Sri <br />Lanka and Saanthimaththivu, were the "Palanthivukal". They are <br />presently referred to, partly as Maldive Islands coming under <br />separate rule, and partly as Laccadive Islands (Lakshadweep) coming <br />under the rule of mainland India.</p>
<p>Rajaraja's conquer of "Palanthivukal", is refered to in his <br />Meikeerthi in Tamil as "Munneer Palanthivu Panneer ayiram" meaning <br />the "old islands tweleve thousand of the sea".</p>
<p>Rajendra's conquer of "Palanthivukal" is refered to as "Sangathir <br />velaith thol perung kaaval pal Palanthivum" in Tamil in his <br />Meikeerthi meaning the "ancient many old islands with waves  <br />resounding conches and having strong guard" </p>
<p>The first mention of this place name - namely the "Palanthivukal" <br />meaning "Old Islands" in Tamil ? is found in an early Tamil Grammer <br />Work known as "Akaththiyar Vaakku", quoted in another 12th Century <br />Tamil Grammer Work known as the "Nannool" by one of it's commentator <br />named the Mayilainathar.</p>
<p>This reference to "Palanthivukal" is found in a group of regional <br />names given in "Akaththiyar Vaakku" as the other countries where <br />Tamil was spoken, which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Kanni then karai ka(da)t Palan thivam, Singalam, Kollam??..palaku <br />Thamil thiri nilangalum mudiyudai moovarum idu nila aatchi"</p>

<p>Palanthivukal was in the south of the Kanni the region of <br />Kanyakumari, of TamilNadu State, South India.  </p>
<p>The exact location of these Palanthivukal could be further gleaned <br />from the writings of a Portugese Traveller named "Duarte Barbosa" of <br />the early `seventeenth century' to the Indian Archipelago.</p>
<p>"Opposite this country of Malabar, forty leagues to the west in the <br />sea there is an archipelago of isles which the Indians say amount to <br />twelve thousand, and they begin in front of mountain Dely and extend <br />southwards. The first are four small flat islands which are called <br />Malandiva, they are inhabited by Malabar Moors and they say that <br />they <br />are from the kingdom of Cananor............Over against Panam, <br />Cochin, and Coulam to the west and south-west at a distance of <br />seventy-five leagues are other islands of which ten or twelve are <br />inhabited by Moors, brown and small in stature who have a separate <br />language and a Moorish king who resides in an island called Mahaldi<br />(v)<br />u. And they call all these islands Palandiva..........Leaving these <br />islands of Mahaldiva further on towards the east where the cape of <br />Comoary......."</p>
<p>A Description of the coasts of East Africa and Malabar - by Duarte <br />Barbosa, page 164 &amp; 166</p>
<p>Laccadive Islands (Lakshadeevip) together were known as <br />Palanthivukal <br />to the Indians of the early days. It seems though these islands <br />together would not had an exact count, the Indians from early days <br />believed that there have been twelve thousand islands.</p>
<p>But there could have been a good possibility of many more tiny <br />inhabitable islets been in existence in the early days, but not as <br />much as twelve thousand that could have existed during the time of <br />Rajaraja and Rajendra Chola 990 years ago. Many of such small islets <br />could have been possibly submerged into the sea and now left with <br />the <br />present number of Islets as it exists today - as groups of Maldive <br />Islands and Laccadive Islands (Lakshadeevip). </p>
<p>Conquer of Palathivukal by Rajaraja Chola ? 1:   </p>
<p>In two inscriptions of the 29th year of Rajaraja Chola - 1 on the <br />walls of Thanjavur Great Temple,<br />we note that there is no mention of Palanthivukal among the list of <br />countries conquered by him.</p>
<p>However in two other subsequent inscriptions of the same 29th year <br />in <br />the same temple, we note the Palanthivukal has been included in the <br />list.</p>
<p>Hence it is very clear that in the mid of 29th year of Rajaraja's <br />rule the Cholas captured the Palanthivukal, that is in the year (985 <br />+ 29) = A.D.1014 almost towards the end of his reign.</p>
<p>The principal reason for capture of these small group of Islets, <br />many <br />of which are inhabitable and with less useful vegetations that could <br />be grown there, could have been that there lived the Sea Priates in <br />these islands who would have been a great hinderence to the Sea <br />Traders from Kerala state and Tamil Nadu state which formed parts of <br />the then Chola Empire, from moving around freely in the Indian Ocean <br />with their trading activities.</p>
<p>This would have made Rajaraja Chola to think that it was necessary <br />to <br />capture these Islands too and bring them under the Chola fold, even <br />at the tail end of his rule.</p>
<p>Or may be that Rajaraja Chola himself would have felt, that without <br />conquering also these vast number of small Islets close to his <br />mainland empire, that his imperialistic adventures would not be <br />complete.    </p>
<p>Conquer of Palanthivukal by Rajendra Chola - 1:  </p>
<p>year inscriptions speak of the capture of Palanthivukal as the last <br />in the list of countries found in his Meikeerthi. We also come <br />across <br />an inscription of his 5th year which too mentions his capture of <br />the <br />Palanthivukal as the last. Hence it is very clear this event would <br />have taken place in the very latter part of his 5th year that is in <br />(1012 +5 ) = A.D.1017.</p>
<p>Rajendra Chola - 1 after ascending the throne would have found it <br />necessary to send another expedition to the Palanthivukal to firmly <br />establish their hold on these islands.</p>
<p>There "could have been a possibility" that he appointed and left one <br />of his generals with some forces in the principal island among this <br />group of islands, whose generation over a period of time would have <br />become the sole rulers of these islands.    </p>
<p>This could have been also the possible reason the "copper plates <br />grant' (known as `Lomafanu' in Maldivian language and as `Sasanam' <br />in <br />Sanskrit) issued in A.D.1196-97 in the "Haddummati Atol" (an Island <br />among the group of modern Maldive Islands), nearly 190 years later<br />after Rajendra's conquest, starts the narration with the <br />words "Swasti Sri" as it was prevalent in Meikeerthis of the Chola <br />kings of that Period. </p>
<p>The list of names of the rulers of the island found in these plates <br />are as follows which shows much of South Indian influence. The <br />names <br />are,</p>
<p>(1)	Sri Marhabarana<br />(2)	Svasti Sri Buvana Aditya<br />(3)	Svasti Sri Buvanabarana<br />(4)	Svasti Sri Darmmananda<br />(5)	Svasti Sri Srimat Somanga</p>
<p>Yet another set of plates from "Bodugala Miskit of Male Atol" <br />(another Island among the group of modern Maldive Islands) issued in <br />A.D.1356-57 too has further names of it's rulers, also having Indian <br />influence. But among them the most interesting one is the name which <br />reads as,</p>
<p>"Sri Ra-aradesvara"<br />Could this have been a corruption of Rajarajeswara over a period of <br />approximately 350 years ???</p>
<p>All above rferences are from the book titled "The Maldive Islands - <br />Monograph on History &amp; Archaelogy by H.C.P.Bell ? Pages 179-186 </p>
<p>However we do need "more evidence" to prove positively, that these <br />kings were the decendents of "a possible General or Chieftain who <br />would have been placed to be in charge" of these islands by Rajendra <br />Chola.</p>
<p>Mr Clarence Maloney in his book titled "People of the Maldive <br />Islands" (Page 107/8) has made the following statements which too <br />are <br />noteworthy.</p>
<p>(1)	"the Divehi (the Maldivian language) word for trader <br />is "Soliya", and many foreign ports of call are known in Divehi by <br />their Tamil names.</p>
<p>(2)	"Influence of medieval Tamil traders on the Maldives can be <br />seen in most of the Divehi words for trade, and many words for items <br />traded . Words for bundle, to sell, trade, steel, and cloves, and <br />navigation terms such as pilot and compass are of Tamil origin. C(h)<br />ola coins "kasu" which were standard in Sri Lanka and much of South <br />India, have been found in the Maldives too. </p>
<p>We also have another interesting account on a king of Maldive <br />Islands, in the Sri Lankan Pali chronicle named Culavamsa (Wilhelm <br />Geiger's Translation ? Part 1, Page 228) from which we note "few <br />years after the death of king Vijayabahu ? 1{A.D.1059-1114} of Sri <br />Lanka", during the parallel period when Kuloththunga Chola ? 1<br />(A.D.1070-1118) was ruling in South India, a warrior lord of the <br />Ariya country by the name "Viradeva" who was the sole sovereign <br />of "Palandipa" (Palanthivukal) invaded Sri Lanka and pursued after <br />its new ruler Vikkramabahu ? 2 for his capture and for his kingdom. <br />However after Viradeva's initial success, he was finally defeated <br />and <br />killed by Vikkramabahu.</p>
<p>period the Maldive Islands were known as "Palandipa".  </p>
<p>Further we note, in the year A.D.1070 Kuloththunga Chola ? 1 became <br />the next successor to the Chola Empire. However he lost the northern <br />part of Sri Lanka in A.D.1088 which he never attempted to regain. </p>
<p>"May be" the warrior lord "Viradeva" referred above who was the sole <br />sovereign of Palandipa was a "decendent" of a possible Chola general <br />who was placed in Palandipa during the period of Rajendra Chola, and <br />who with the death of Kuloththunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1118 and <br />becoming <br />independent free of Chola control on Palanthivukal, and with the <br />death of Vijayabahu ? 1 in A.D.1114 and turmoil following same in <br />Sri <br />Lanka would have thought of capturing this island for himself, and <br />could have possibly made this expedition. </p>
<p>However "the above inferences needs further evidences" to prove them <br />positively.</p>

<p>    During the early period of Maldivian history, Maldives consisted <br />of<br />    fourteen atolls. The<br />    northernmost atoll was Minicoy, called Maliku Atholhu. The <br />country<br />    was said to consist of<br />    Malikadduu demedhu; meaning "the islands between Maliku and Addu<br />    Atolls". The cultural and<br />    historical affinities can be seen in the language, oral <br />traditions,<br />    customs and most of all from the<br />    close relationships and inter-marriages between families of <br />Minicoy<br />    islanders and Maldivians.<br />    Between the tenth and twelfth centuries A.D., the Chola King<br />    Rajaraja I captured the two<br />    northernmost atolls of Maldives, Maliku Atoll (Minicoy) and<br />    Thiladhummathi. These two atolls<br />    remained under the Cholas until 1121 when King Mahaabarana of the<br />    Theemuge dynasty defeated<br />    the Cholas, and brought them under Maldivian sovereignty<br />    (Shihabuddine c. 1588-1658). According<br />    to present information, Minicoy remained part of Maldives from <br />then<br />    on until the early sixteenth<br />    century, when the island passed into the hands of the ruler of<br />    Cannannore.</p>

<p>  During the early period of Maldivian history, Maldives consisted of<br />  fourteen atolls. The<br />  northernmost atoll was Minicoy, called Maliku Atholhu. The country<br />  was said to consist of<br />  Malikadduu demedhu; meaning "the islands between Maliku and Addu<br />  Atolls". The cultural and<br />  historical affinities can be seen in the language, oral traditions,<br />  customs and most of all from the<br />  close relationships and inter-marriages between families of Minicoy<br />  islanders and Maldivians.<br />  Between the tenth and twelfth centuries A.D., the Chola King<br />  Rajaraja I captured the two<br />  northernmost atolls of Maldives, Maliku Atoll (Minicoy) and<br />  Thiladhummathi. These two atolls<br />  remained under the Cholas until 1121 when King Mahaabarana of the<br />  Theemuge dynasty defeated<br />  the Cholas, and brought them under Maldivian sovereignty<br />  (Shihabuddine c. 1588-1658). According<br />  to present information, Minicoy remained part of Maldives from then<br />  on until the early sixteenth<br />  century, when the island passed into the hands of the ruler of<br />  Cannannore.</p>

<p>Given below are some of the names by which Maldives was known <br />through the centuries.<br />1. The earliest known reference to Maldives is given in the <br />Mahavansa, the ancient<br />chronicle of the people of Sri Lanka, written in c. 200 BC. In these <br />records Maldives<br />is referred to as Mahinda-dvipa.<br />2. About the fourth century AD, Palladius, Bishop of Hellenopolis <br />(360-430 AD) a<br />classical Greek bishop, refers to Maldives as Maniolae, in his <br />document "On the<br />Races of the Indian and the Brahmans", adding that the magnet stone <br />which attracts<br />iron was produced in these islands.<br />3. In ancient South Indian Pallava Dynasty inscriptions of the 7th <br />century AD, Maldives<br />were called Dvipa Laksham (a hundred thousand islands).<br />4. Hsuan Tsang, a Buddhist monk who travelled in India for religious <br />studies in the<br />years 629 to 645 AD, was the first Chinese writer to mention <br />Maldives. He called the<br />islands Na-lo-ki-lo-chou (coconut islands).<br />5. A Chinese document from the Tang Dynasty, records the visit of <br />Maldivians to China<br />bringing with them gifts from their king, Baladitiya in 658 AD and <br />also in 662 AD.<br />Maldives is referred to as Mo-lai in this document.<br />6. In a 10th century South Indian record of the Chola Dynasty, <br />Maldives is given the<br />name Munnir Palantivu Pannirayiram (twelve thousand islands and the <br />ocean where<br />three waters meet).<br />7. Sulaiman was a Persian merchant and sea-captain who lived in the <br />first half of the<br />ninth century AD. His manuscripts describing his travels and the <br />places he visited<br />were found in France in the 1700's. In his description of Maldives, <br />he gives them the<br />name Dibajat. Al Biruni in the 11th century and Al Idrisi in the <br />12th century AD, also<br />referred to Maldives by the name of Dibajat.<br />8. Abu Zayd, who lived in Iraq in the years 850 to 934 AD, writes of <br />Maldives as Dyvah<br />Kouzah (cowrie islands).<br />9. In the Tamil commentary Tolkattiyam of the 13th century AD, <br />Maldives is called<br />Palpalamtivu (many old islands).<br />10. A Chinese writer Wang Ta-Yuan, writing in 1349, gave the <br />Maldives the name Pei<br />Liu. In 1414 AD, Cheng Ho the famous Chinese commander came to <br />Maldives,<br />bringing with him a scribe by the name of Ma Huan, to record their <br />travels. In Ma<br />Huan's records Maldives is called Liu Shan Tieh-<acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  (the countries <br />of the island<br />mountains). In 1436 AD, another Chinese writer Fei Hsin called the <br />islands, Liu Shan<br />Yang (atolls of Maldives).<br />11. The 13th century Kudahuvadhoo Loamaafaanu give Maldives' name as<br />"Panandheepu". The Bodugalu Miskiiy Loamaafaanu gives the same name <br />as<br />"Fanandheebu".<br />12. Ibn Batuta who visited Maldives in 1343 and stayed for 18 <br />months, and returned in<br />1346 AD, called the islands by the name, Dhibat Al Mahal.<br />13. When the first Portuguese arrived in the East in the early 16th <br />century, Maldives was<br />referred to by them as Ilha Dywe.<br />14. In1573 AD, when Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-Auzam became Sultan <br />after the<br />defeat of the Portuguese, he gave the country the official name of <br />Al Daulat min al-<br />Mahaldibiyat.<br />15. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Maldives was called <br />Maldiva Islands in many<br />English records, but by the beginning of the 20th century, Maldives <br />or Maldive Islands<br />had become the commonly used name.</acronym></p>

<p>Maldivian Seafaring in the Pre-Portuguese Period<br />Naseema Mohamed<br />The National Centre for Linguistic and Historical Research<br />Male'<br />Republic of Maldives</p>
<p>During the early period of Maldivian history, Maldives consisted of <br />fourteen atolls. The<br />northernmost atoll was Minicoy, called Maliku Atholhu. The country <br />was said to consist of<br />Malikadduu demedhu; meaning "the islands between Maliku and Addu <br />Atolls". The cultural and<br />historical affinities can be seen in the language, oral traditions, <br />customs and most of all from the<br />close relationships and inter-marriages between families of Minicoy <br />islanders and Maldivians.<br />Between the tenth and twelfth centuries A.D., the Chola King <br />Rajaraja I captured the two<br />northernmost atolls of Maldives, Maliku Atoll (Minicoy) and <br />Thiladhummathi. These two atolls<br />remained under the Cholas until 1121 when King Mahaabarana of the <br />Theemuge dynasty defeated<br />the Cholas, and brought them under Maldivian sovereignty <br />(Shihabuddine c. 1588-1658). According<br />to present information, Minicoy remained part of Maldives from then <br />on until the early sixteenth<br />century, when the island passed into the hands of the ruler of <br />Cannannore.</p>

          Great Feats...        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>History can be tampered for some time to meet selfish needs but eventually will spring up as time moves on.<br />British had the power that point in time, they have certainly made many valuable contributions. However they have tampered enough with our history and religion to suit their needs (this is no surprise). They are responsible world over to have created instability and dividing people. You seem to be saying they constructed bridges and railways to promote indian facilities to help poor indian people :-) au contraire, it was for reaching remotest parts of the country and to conquer and plunder. They were no better than Ghajini or Gori. Only difference is Gori's and gajini's had no idea of ruling the country, the birts were in for the long haul. They systematically ripped us giving bread crumbs. We have not got anywhere for 50 - 60 yrs from where they left.<br />Compare today's india vs todays england. After world war II they were brought to knees by their Nazi neighbors and India was by their ruling counters. Brits had positioned a puppet govt in India, strengthened their commerce and... ensured that they got the funds from us where we were left with corrupt politicians and so on .. so forth. Their tube alone makes a difference, vs our railways.<br />There is no harm in feeling the patriotic edge, I am an indian and it pains me every time to see the kohinoor on the crown. Infact, India should sue England for its possesion of indian valuables. <br />Nyayama partha, england valarchikku india panam kuduthirukku, so we need our ROI asap :-) <br />If I can have my India back with its blossom as discoveries in science and leading the world instead of having poverty and crooked politics, damn, I will be happy to take Karikalan as the builder of Big temple. In the grander scheme of things, this is immaterial. </p>

We are learning to be less naive. In some issues it hurts people as it affects generations of belief. Tamil or Indian mentality is not denying pride but questioning the right to it. I dont see anything wrong in it. <br />Some time back in our group there was a small argument about the language spoken during <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's time (hope im right). It came to a very inconclusive end. And if it weren't for the British in the 1800's we would still be thinking <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym built Big Temple. thats completely laughable!! <br />Instead being blinded by emotions we need to take constructive steps to prove ourselves right. We need to question ourselves before the world starts to do it. Anybody who doesn't want to hear it is not mature enough for this argument. <br />Madan questioned this and was labelled everything just short of traitor. I would love it if <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was The Greatest...just tell me why? Because he built a Big Temple, he conquered Srilanka, presence of Chola coins and kalvettus in far off lands might suggest trade, etc. come on people, you can do better. <br />Mr.Venketesh often gives an example of the piece of fabric describing "The Battle of Hastings". <br />One more thing is there enough data on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  to write a biography of 300 pages? <br />Everytime this argument crops up somebody ends it by saying there is a lot of data not shown to public viewing describing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  as the greatest. <br />Atleast this time show something conclusive which will shut this once and for all.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></rahul.dhinakaran@gmail.com></p>

<p>you did well by clausing your initial statement...for humor sake. I <br />take your side ...kings are too precious to lead upfront in battle <br />and in most cases they held together their vast lands by surrounding <br />themselves with good hands and not by encasing themselves in iron. <br />Unfortunately our later year maharajas did exactly this...read the <br />maharajas of india, by ann morrow of the later ( princely states <br />during british rule)....you will see their leelaigal...portly, 50 <br />year old, physcially jestor like maharajas dancing with petite <br />damsels of europe, maharajas keeping ( and wining) bets like who <br />will deflower the maximum vi....ns in a year, importing lions from <br />africa because their hunting grounds did not have them in enough <br />number, using the largest diamond in the world as a paper weight, <br />parading around completely naked except for a diamond brocade as a <br />show of kingly masculinity.....a complete silver ensemble train set <br />that could serve dinner to your guests..... </p>
<p>but dont beleive you can bring in <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym /RJC in similar vein....you <br />could possibly get away with murder in your state, but for you <br />disperse these false propaganda across a region as far away as <br />indonesia///china...they were truely great. the big temple and <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  <br />temple were superhuman efforts built to crown their fantastic <br />feats...feats that make you sit up and think...what bade them on <br />this path...reminded of this...dreams are not what you get in your <br />sleep, dreams are what make you loose your sleep.</acronym></acronym></p>

Do<br />  you really think a sculptor/painter/poet would be rewarded if he <br />dint<br />  glorify the king. they had to make the king look larger than life <br />else they<br />  risk loosing their life.<br />  Im not trying to say all our kings were like that but there must <br />have been <br />  some really smart chaps. Infact if i were king i would probably <br />want myself<br />  painted like a hero and want future generations talk only about my <br />victories<br />  with some masala added.

<p>    hi sps sir</p>
<p>    nice of you to bring this up...in these days when everyone asks <br />for<br />    proof that our heros were indeed heros..and not like 23ram <br />pullikesi<br />    ( the painting episode) </p>
<p>    anyway, we do hear of superhuman feats ...even from the<br />    ramayana ..rama i think is said to be capable of shooting an <br />arrow<br />    right though 5 full grown tree trunks, dasarata using just <br />sounds to<br />    locate his targets and shoot them down....he is also said to have<br />    shot his arrows in rameshwaram ( the many wells)</p>
<p>    the buddha was once challenged to demonstrate his archery <br />skills. He<br />    asked for five arrows, and shot four of them simultaneously in <br />four<br />    directions in the sky. A raven flying high up momentarily found <br />its<br />    way blocked everywhere. Then he shot his fifth arrow and brought <br />    down the confused raven. This episode is narrated in the text <br />Kanjur<br />    Dulwa.</p>
<p>    and of course arjuna looking into the reflection and...chanced on<br />    this interesting article ( dont have the full one though ) but <br />the<br />    concept is quite remarkable..the way they draw parallels</p>
<p>    The laparoscopic surgeon is trained to acquire advanced skills to<br />    perform the complicated laparoscopic surgery of the target <br />tissue in<br />    a three-dimensional (3D) space by viewing its two-dimensional <br />(2D)<br />    video image. This technique finds its parallel in a very ancient<br />    archery episode portrayed in the longest and the greatest Indian <br />    epic, Mahabarata. In this epic, Arjuna, the master archer, is<br />    required to employ the strategy of aiming at the eye of a target<br />    fish rotating above his head by viewing its reflected image <br />below in<br />    water; of course, all this to win the hand of a beautiful <br />princess!<br />    Arjuna is so trained that he cannot but excel in focusing his<br />    attention on his target. A comparative study of the laparoscopic <br />    surgeon and the ancient master archer is done in this paper with <br />a<br />    view to throwing light on the interesting similarities between <br />the<br />    archer and the modern laparoscopic surgeon with respect to <br />training<br />    methods, skills, and techniques.<br />    <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/" title="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/</a> </p>

        <p>On the contrary our mentality has been to accept anything said without proof<br />as long the source sounds convincing. We are learning to be less naive. In<br />some issues it hurts people as it affects generations of belief. Tamil or<br />Indian mentality is not denying pride but questioning the right to it. I<br />dont see anything wrong in it.<br />Some time back in our group there was a small argument about the language<br />spoken during <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's time (hope im right). It came to a very inconclusive<br />end. And if it weren't for the British in the 1800's we would still be<br />thinking <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym built Big Temple. thats completely laughable!!<br />Instead being blinded by emotions we need to take constructive steps to<br />prove ourselves right. We need to question ourselves before the world starts<br />to do it. Anybody who doesn't want to hear it is not mature enough for this<br />argument.<br />Madan questioned this and was labelled everything just short of traitor. I<br />would love it if <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was The Greatest...just tell me why? Because he built<br />a Big Temple, he conquered Srilanka, presence of Chola coins and kalvettus<br />in far off lands might suggest trade, etc. come on people, you can do<br />better.<br />Mr.Venketesh often gives an example of the piece of fabric describing "The<br />Battle of Hastings".<br />One more thing is there enough data on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  to write a biography of 300<br />pages?<br />Everytime this argument crops up somebody ends it by saying there is a lot<br />of data not shown to public viewing describing <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  as the greatest.<br />Atleast this time show something conclusive which will shut this once and<br />for all.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>

<p>  you did well by clausing your initial statement...for humor sake.

<p>  but dont beleive you can bring in RRC/RJC in similar vein....you<br />  could possibly get away with murder in your state, but for you<br />  disperse these false propaganda across a region as far away as<br />  indonesia///china...they were truely great. the big temple and GKC<br />  temple were superhuman efforts built to crown their fantastic<br />  feats...feats that make you sit up and think...what bade them on<br />  this path...reminded of this...dreams are not what you get in your<br />  sleep, dreams are what make you loose your sleep.</p>

<p>    hi vijay;     just for humor sake, how sure are you that the armor in Pudukottai<br />  museum is<br />    indeed the one worn by Kattabommmu? Maybe he was just 5ft tall and<br />  ensured<br />    that he got his ironsmith to make a huge armor so that future<br />  generations<br />    would think he is a bull (kaattu erumai in the words of our<br />  wonderful<br />    Vadivelu).<br />    Remember "Varalaaru miga mukkiyam amaichare"<br />    I hold a similar opinion about kalvettus and paintings of our<br />  maharajas. Do<br />    you really think a sculptor/painter/poet would be rewarded if he<br />  dint<br />    glorify the king. they had to make the king look larger than life<br />  else they<br />    risk loosing their life.<br />    Im not trying to say all our kings were like that but there must<br />  have been<br />    some really smart chaps. Infact if i were king i would probably<br />  want myself<br />    painted like a hero and want future generations talk only about my<br />  victories<br />    with some masala added. While this was being written i would be<br />  spending<br />    time in the anthapuram..who cares about bringing Ganga or winning<br />  wars. :)<br />    :) :)</p>

<p>      hi sps sir</p>
<p>      nice of you to bring this up...in these days when everyone asks<br />  for<br />      proof that our heros were indeed heros..and not like 23ram<br />  pullikesi<br />      ( the painting episode)</p>
<p>      anyway, we do hear of superhuman feats ...even from the<br />      ramayana ..rama i think is said to be capable of shooting an<br />  arrow<br />      right though 5 full grown tree trunks, dasarata using just<br />  sounds to<br />      locate his targets and shoot them down....he is also said to have<br />      shot his arrows in rameshwaram ( the many wells)</p>
<p>      the buddha was once challenged to demonstrate his archery<br />  skills. He<br />      asked for five arrows, and shot four of them simultaneously in<br />  four<br />      directions in the sky. A raven flying high up momentarily found<br />  its<br />      way blocked everywhere. Then he shot his fifth arrow and brought<br />      down the confused raven. This episode is narrated in the text<br />  Kanjur<br />      Dulwa.</p>
<p>      and of course arjuna looking into the reflection and...chanced on<br />      this interesting article ( dont have the full one though ) but<br />  the<br />      concept is quite remarkable..the way they draw parallels</p>
<p>      The laparoscopic surgeon is trained to acquire advanced skills to<br />      perform the complicated laparoscopic surgery of the target<br />  tissue in<br />      a three-dimensional (3D) space by viewing its two-dimensional<br />  (2D)<br />      video image. This technique finds its parallel in a very ancient<br />      archery episode portrayed in the longest and the greatest Indian<br />      epic, Mahabarata. In this epic, Arjuna, the master archer, is<br />      required to employ the strategy of aiming at the eye of a target<br />      fish rotating above his head by viewing its reflected image<br />  below in<br />      water; of course, all this to win the hand of a beautiful<br />  princess!<br />      Arjuna is so trained that he cannot but excel in focusing his<br />      attention on his target. A comparative study of the laparoscopic<br />      surgeon and the ancient master archer is done in this paper with<br />  a<br />      view to throwing light on the interesting similarities between<br />  the<br />      archer and the modern laparoscopic surgeon with respect to<br />  training<br />      methods, skills, and techniques.<br />      <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/" title="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/4632821633652763/</a></p>

<p>            i remember reading an article in Mr.Jaybee's website about<br />  the<br />          tamil weapon<br />            Valari. This is also a boomerang shaped weapon but it does<br />  not<br />          return. So<br />            the name Valari must have been concocted from Valai Eri.<br />      Knives<br />          were<br />            attached to the ends and then thrown at the enemy making it<br />        highly<br />            destructive and dangerous.
