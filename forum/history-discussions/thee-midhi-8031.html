</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Sacrificial rituals have been part of Hinduism from time immemorial, we hear about how penances were performed by tenacious boon seekers sacrificing limbs or even human lives.? Several bloody sacrificial practices?were common during Hindu religious rituals ( tantric sacrificial rituals)?in theperiod of ?social and religious rudderless-ness and vacuum?when Buddism and Jainism reached their?nadir points.??The religious practices were given direction and attained restoration thorugh the preachings of reformers?such as Adi Shankara in the 8 th century . Several obnoxious practices such as Sati ( co-cremation of widows along with diseased husbands ) continued socially well into 19th Century until it was legally banned by the British in Bengal around 1829. We know of a few occurrences even during our present times. </p>
<p>Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social compulsions and or?for acceptance?without semblance of?adherence to devotion, even though they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee midhi'?or?shiates' who engage in self beating?bloody on the tenth day of?'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else. The performers no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.???</p>
<p>There was only one?Kannappa nayanar we?know?of symbolizing?unconditional?adoration to the?Lord he believed and nursed by culling his one eye. We also know that?the Lord came to stop him from doing further self infliction. </p>
<p>'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>? <br />The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a strategy for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places you can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your feet is whatit needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has nothing to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs :))</p>

Just fyi to<br />        you a huge number of thee midhis are used as stunts almost arrangedlike<br />        circus with an organiser and participant, soon after the participants are<br />        whisked away so that audience does not see any injuries on her foot. Usually<br />        these are very poor women doing it for a living. It is not related to<br />        authentic devotion in the least and those of us who believe also must<br />        strongly discourage.</p>

<p>          Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be like an<br />        acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is relative. I can never dare<br />        to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt.</p>

<p>              Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faith<br />        and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of<br />        accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the appeal does<br />        not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on person's<br />        feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be<br />        anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as these.</p>
<p>              There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not<br />        possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark of<br />        unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked bythe<br />        Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worship in Tamil<br />        nadu..</p>
<p>                But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique" practice<br />        separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism ishighly<br />        flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style of<br />        viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not as whole<br />        and holistic..</p>
<p>                In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is indicative<br />        of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped durign this<br />        festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi amman, Kali<br />        amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman, Draupadi<br />        amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all these<br />        ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy and<br />        great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />        Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part of<br />        Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take literally<br />        thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her devotees in<br />        each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised. Mariamman is<br />        mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi Devi in<br />        these verses!</p>
<p>                ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is Shiva's<br />        emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in most of<br />        the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers shout<br />        "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the poster say<br />        that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktismand<br />        Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that trasncends the<br />        ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so blatantly<br />        visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that callsfor<br />        great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the<br />        forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in<br />        chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner<br />        temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in<br />        chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people<br />        than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the<br />        remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam,<br />        karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of<br />        these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from<br />        the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these<br />        people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the<br />        masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has<br />        not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves<br />        in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements<br />        have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>                hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and largein<br />        tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />                i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district<br />        pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>                in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500years<br />        of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>    I was merely responding to one of the comments made by Srinivasan<br />  Natarajan<br />    on the subject- "The term true devotion itself is relative. I can never<br />  dare<br />    to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt."</p>
<p>    The points I was trying to make are-</p>
<p>    a. Kannappar (and the alike) demonstrated unconditional, single minded<br />    and steadfast devotion that surpassed physical sufferings. The relation<br />  was<br />    one to one with the Lord who tested his devout commitment to the cause.<br />    It is also true in each one of the stories of Nayanars ( thanks for<br />  your<br />    some references to the 63 you have made ).</p>
<p>    Once tested, and proved of his sterling devotion, Kannappa was stopped<br />  from<br />    culling out his second eye-</p>
<p>    " thangan mun ida-k-kung kaiai-th-thadu-k-ka moondradu-k-ku<br />    naaga<br />    kanganar amudavar-k-kuk ' Kannappa nirka' endra... "</p>
<p>    Leading to my second point -</p>
<p>    b. Physical suffering is not the only measure of true devotion.</p>
<p>    c. 'thee midi' rituals can't be compared to devotions exemplified by<br />    the likes of Kannappa.</p>
<p>    Ms. Malathi, thanks for your clarification; it is indeed difficult<br />    to make a distinction of group fervor influenced by social<br />  compulsions from<br />    true devotion.</p>
<p>    In my humble opinion neither physical sufferings demonstrate<br />  devotion, nor<br />    scriptures prescribe them as atonement.</p>
<p>    Your reference to cleaning murky mind is life long sojourn, to realize<br />  that<br />    mind needs cleaning being the first mile stone.</p>
<p>    Sri. Vairam's story is touching demonstration of faith and conviction.<br />    Such experience with divinity could be best cherished by the individuals<br />  who<br />    undergo the encounters.</p>
<p>    Best regards,</p>
<p>    TMS</p>

<p>    Hi Malathi</p>
<p>    If you notice I did not say ` great', only feats. They were judged and<br />    inducted into the hall of fame ( by who - venkat has asked this question<br />    many time). To understand why and what were the criteria etc, needs a<br />    measure, judgement and understanding that a contemporary yardstick will<br />  not<br />    do justice.</p>
<p>    I was only wanting to highlight the rest of the elite group as a reply to<br />    below statement by our good member and that there are many more such<br />  feats<br />    in tiruthondarthogai.</p>

Several bloody sacrificial practices were<br />        common<br />        during Hindu religious rituals ( tantric sacrificial rituals) in the<br />        period<br />        of social and religious rudderless-ness and vacuum when Buddism and<br />        Jainism<br />        reached their nadir points. The religious practices were given<br />        direction<br />        and attained restoration thorugh the preachings of reformers such as<br />        Adi<br />        Shankara in the 8 th century . Several obnoxious practices such as<br />  Sati<br />        (<br />        co-cremation of widows along with diseased husbands ) continued<br />        socially<br />        well into 19th Century until it was legally banned by the British in<br />        Bengal<br />        around 1829. We know of a few occurrences even during our present<br />        times.</tmsunder@...></p>
<p>        Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social<br />  compulsions<br />        and<br />        or for acceptance without semblance of adherence to devotion, even<br />        though<br />        they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />        midhi' or shiates' who engage in self beating bloody on the tenth day<br />        of 'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else. The<br />        performers<br />        no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.</p>
<p>        There was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of<br />        symbolizing uncondit ional adoration to the Lord he believed and<br />  nursed<br />        by<br />        culling his one eye. We also know that the Lord came to stop him from<br />        doing<br />        further self infliction.</p>
<p>        'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>        The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a<br />        strategy<br />        for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite<br />  safety<br />        measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places<br />        you<br />        can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your<br />        feet is<br />        what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has<br />        nothing<br />        to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few<br />  laughs<br />        :))</p>

<p>             I remember watching a program in Discovery - Myth Busters -<br />             regarding<br />             this<br />             'thee midhi'.<br />             They demonstrated that, if a person walks quickly, may be a sort<br />             of<br />             slow<br />             sprint on the burning charcoal, nothing happens..may be a few<br />             blisters<br />             but<br />             nothing serious would happen.</p>
<p>             If we notice, most of these rituals, people will run and dont<br />  walk<br />             slowly<br />             for 5 mins, singing song as they show in karagatakaran.</p>

It is not<br />               related<br />               to<br />               authentic devotion in the least and those of us who believe<br />  also<br />               must<br />               strongly discourage.</p>

<p>                 Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be like an<br />               acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is relative. I<br />               can<br />               never dare<br />               to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt.</p>

<p>                     Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                     unflinching faith<br />               and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to<br />  lot<br />               of<br />               accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that<br />  the<br />               appeal does<br />               not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds<br />  on<br />               person's<br />               feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK<br />               protests<br />               may be<br />               anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such<br />  as<br />               these.</p>
<p>                     There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith<br />  is<br />                     not<br />               possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                       The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a<br />                       hallmark<br />                       of<br />               unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually<br />  mocked<br />               by<br />               the<br />               Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti<br />               worship in<br />               Tamil<br />               nadu..</p>
<p>                       But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some<br />                       "unique"<br />                       practice<br />               separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream<br />  Hinduism<br />               is<br />               highly<br />               flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial<br />               style<br />               of<br />               viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and<br />               not<br />               as whole<br />               and holistic..</p>
<p>                       In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual<br />  is<br />                       indicative<br />               of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is<br />  worshipped<br />               durign this<br />               festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi<br />               amman,<br />               Kali<br />               amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani<br />  amman,<br />               Draupadi<br />               amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites*<br />               all<br />               these<br />               ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep<br />               philosophy<br />               and<br />               great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called<br />               Durga<br />               Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is<br />               part<br />               of<br />               Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will<br />  take<br />               literally<br />               thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless<br />  her<br />               devotees in<br />               each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />               Mariamman is<br />               mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as<br />               Vaishnavi<br />               Devi in<br />               these verses!</p>
<p>                       ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that<br />                       is<br />                       Shiva's<br />               emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and<br />  in<br />               most of<br />               the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the<br />               firewalkers<br />               shout<br />               "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does<br />  the<br />               poster say<br />               that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism,<br />               Shaktism<br />               and<br />               Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                       Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                       trasncends the<br />               ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is<br />               so<br />               blatantly<br />               visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that<br />               calls<br />               for<br />               great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                       friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice<br />                       event<br />                       on the<br />               forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                       last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                       walking) in<br />               chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the<br />               street<br />               corner<br />               temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />               temples in<br />               chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                       no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to<br />  the<br />                       people<br />               than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman<br />               followers.<br />               only the<br />               remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                       the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal<br />                       kudam<br />                       oorvalam,<br />               karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />               halmark of<br />               these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />               mostly from<br />               the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness<br />               among<br />               these<br />               people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                       a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation<br />                       of<br />                       the<br />               masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of<br />  psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                       mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing<br />  tradition<br />                       which has<br />               not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />               christian waves<br />               in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal<br />  religious<br />               movements<br />               have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />               community.</p>
<p>                       hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and<br />                       large<br />                       in<br />               tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />               ofcourse.<br />                       i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem<br />  rural<br />                       district<br />               pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of<br />               kalvarayn<br />               hills.</p>
<p>                       in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after<br />                       2500<br />                       years<br />               of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

        <p>Dear tms</p>
<p>While on the topic, Did kannappar put his leg on the lingam while<br />gouging his other eye. Or did shiva stop him when he was in the act of<br />doing it in his first eye? Rememeber reading an interesting article in<br />earlier issues of varalaru.com regarding a sculpture panel fm<br />sriperumbudur temple. Will try and post it again. So was there an<br />attempt ( later) to add some addnl masala / mirchi.</p>

<p>  a. Kannappar (and the?alike) demonstrated?unconditional, single minded<br />  and?steadfast devotion that surpassed physical sufferings.? The relation was<br />  one to one with the Lord who tested?his devout commitment?to the cause.<br />  ??It is?also true in each one of the stories of Nayanars (?thanksfor your<br />  some references to the 63 you have made ).</p>

<p>  b. Physical suffering is not the only?measure of true devotion.</p>
<p>  c. 'thee midi' rituals can't be compared to devotions exemplified by<br />  the?likes of Kannappa.</p>
<p>  Ms. Malathi,?thanks for your?clarification; it is?indeed difficult<br />  to?make?a?distinction of group?fervor influenced by social compulsions?from<br />  true devotion.</p>
<p>  In my humble opinion?neither physical?sufferings?demonstrate devotion,?nor<br />  scriptures prescribe?them as atonement.</p>
<p>  Your reference to cleaning murky mind is life long sojourn, to realize that<br />  mind needs cleaning being the first mile stone.</p>

<p>  Hi Malathi</p>
<p>  If you notice I did not say ` great', only feats. They were judged and<br />  inducted into the hall of fame ( by who - venkat has asked this question<br />  many time). To understand why and what were the criteria etc, needs a<br />  measure, judgement and understanding that a contemporary yardstick will not<br />  do justice.</p>
<p>  I was only wanting to highlight the rest of the elite group as a reply to<br />  below statement by our good member and that there are many more such feats<br />  in tiruthondarthogai.</p>

<p>  I think on terms with Sri TMS that some of these are social compulsions and<br />  some are pure fervour that is hard to categorize. I think things like<br />  'pillai kari' are not things one should eulogize in these times and age. It<br />  is also somewhat indicative of our own double standards isn't it not ..we<br />  think Jayadeva's example of a woman risking adultery to prove her love to<br />  the lord is obscene but we think a man cooking his child to prove is<br />  devotion is a great feat???</p>

<p>      Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social compulsions<br />      and<br />      or?for acceptance?without semblance of?adherence to devotion, even<br />      though<br />      they are colored of religious connotation.

<p>      The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a<br />      strategy<br />      for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety<br />      measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places<br />      you<br />      can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your<br />      feet is<br />      what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has<br />      nothing<br />      to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs<br />      :))</p>

<p>                   Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                   unflinching faith<br />             and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot<br />             of<br />             accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the<br />             appeal does<br />             not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on<br />             person's<br />             feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK<br />             protests<br />             may be<br />             anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as<br />             these.</p>
<p>                   There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is<br />                   not<br />             possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                     But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some<br />                     "unique"<br />                     practice<br />             separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism<br />             is<br />             highly<br />             flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial<br />             style<br />             of<br />             viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and<br />             not<br />             as whole<br />             and holistic..</p>
<p>                     In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is<br />                     indicative<br />             of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped<br />             durign this<br />             festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi<br />             amman,<br />             Kali<br />             amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman,<br />             Draupadi<br />             amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites*<br />             all<br />             these<br />             ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep<br />             philosophy<br />             and<br />             great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called<br />             Durga<br />             Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is<br />             part<br />             of<br />             Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take<br />             literally<br />             thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her<br />             devotees in<br />             each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />             Mariamman is<br />             mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as<br />             Vaishnavi<br />             Devi in<br />             these verses!</p>
<p>                     ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that<br />                     is<br />                     Shiva's<br />             emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in<br />             most of<br />             the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the<br />             firewalkers<br />             shout<br />             "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the<br />             poster say<br />             that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism,<br />             Shaktism<br />             and<br />             Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                     Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                     trasncends the<br />             ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is<br />             so<br />             blatantly<br />             visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that<br />             calls<br />             for<br />             great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                     friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice<br />                     event<br />                     on the<br />             forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                     last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                     walking) in<br />             chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the<br />             street<br />             corner<br />             temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />             temples in<br />             chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                     no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the<br />                     people<br />             than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman<br />             followers.<br />             only the<br />             remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                     the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal<br />                     kudam<br />                     oorvalam,<br />             karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />             halmark of<br />             these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />             mostly from<br />             the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness<br />             among<br />             these<br />             people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                     a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation<br />                     of<br />                     the<br />             masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                     mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition<br />                     which has<br />             not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />             christian waves<br />             in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious<br />             movements<br />             have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />             community.</p>
<p>                     hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and<br />                     large<br />                     in<br />             tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />             ofcourse.<br />                     i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural<br />                     district<br />             pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of<br />             kalvarayn<br />             hills.</p>
<p>                     in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after<br />                     2500<br />                     years<br />             of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

        <p>See its all in the mind :-) Mind over matter.<br />Deivam endral athu deivam, verum silai endral athu silai thaan !<br />Belief is key to these venduthals to succeed, like in inventions / discoveries/ business / movies / history of monarchs etc - that one 'chosen' person,who believed in what he/she wanted, has endured success but not before theultimate test of faith - the same drama all over.</p>
<p>However, the word 'ancient' ritual is something I am curious, ellarume ancient nu sonna athule arthame illai, my grand dad's thoughts - property etc are ancient, raja rajan's is also ancient, nalan killi is also ancient... sowhen did this 'ancient' practice come to play ?</p>
<p>There is no harm as long as the individual wants to do it on their own willand fancy, its their absolute choice, we may not be able to do that, they would - thats simple faith and trust.</p>
<p>Mottai adicha mudi valarathu nu therinja ethanai per mudi vettuvanga? Appadium sila per vettuvanga - athu thaan intha mathiri venduthal ?</p>
<p>Lastly, DK or any rule cannot change these simple thoughts of people, a favourite line from the serial vidathu karuppu (Tried to recreate as much):</p>
<p>Heroine: Raasu thaan karuppu nu nirubichu intha oor makkal oda nambikkaiya odaichitten, inime yaar inge Karuppu iruku nu solluvanga<br />Counter: Nee appadi solare, ange paar</p>
<p>Scene: People wash the aruval and clothes and take it as a procession to the temple</p>
<p>Counter: Raasu mela karuppu vanthu, karuppoda uduppuku kalangam vanthiduchunu, oor makkal athai sutha paduthi eduthitu poranga.<br />Ivanga nambikkai ellam, unnoda science naala onnum asaikka mudiyathu<br />Heroine - Smiles!</p>

<p>  Na mattum appadiye ponum na ponnen sir, My mother when i was born had a venduthal that she will carry me and walk. But after I was born she was diagnosed with some conditions because of which she cant walk on a such a big trip any more. So they made me walk for the Padayatirai!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Vairam, what a nice inspiring story!! Mine is somewhat similar, we used to walk from our home in Kovai up Marudamalai which is equivalent to Palani in terms of height and steeper as I understand.</p>
<p>  My understanding of such feats has changed/matured and continues to grow over time. The best way i can put it as of now is that - the modern mind isnot easily freed from thought. Thought as many spiritual teachings say is the biggest barrier to experiencing divine grace. When you put your body through extreme exhaustion the mind gives up thinking. So you have direct access to the great divine energy out there that can lift you body and spirit in miraculous ways. The difference between extreme expereinces that involvepersonal achievement (say such as scaling high peaks) and experiences withreligious base is that the second allows for the mind to give up thought and surrender to what is there. Most high acheivers who are exhausted are unable to surrender the mind and many times succumb to their exhaustion - many others realize the limits of human thought this way and experience what may be their first ever spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>  This is not an understanding that even requires any belief in religion orGod although that belief makes it much simpler :))<br />  Malathi</p>

<p>    Every year people walk from my native Devakottai to Palani(175 km - 7 days walk) during Thaipusam. When I was in my college second year I walked this pathayathirai.<br />    Very good experience, Practically even the strongest man cant have stamina to walk the distance without pain. I was first timer I couldnt walk at all. It was impossible. That one of the rare time I realised it it requiressome thing more than self confidence to walk the distane. It surely neededthe drive, the ferocity and religious fervour. The songs sung by people while they walk esp there is one song 'Karupar Paatu' which just makes u violent. I have experienced it my self. I was done and out( I have flat foot a deformity which causes pain in the bones above the heels if you walk for long). Still some 3-4 miles were left in the days walk, it was around 10Pm inthe night. <br />    I was about to fall two people caught me on their shoulders and I totally knew I couldn't walk even for a min. Two guys held me and one person with his powerful voice started singing the Karupar paatu(the song is supposedto be very powerful..when ever this song is sung some ladies get the frenzy while going on padyatra)..the song had some vibrations...I could nt open my eyes , I was still tired ..but my legs walked. After a while we reached the destination.<br />    When we reached the destination all people said I got'Saami' and I was walking really fast like as if I was possessed. Only thing I knew was I wasnt possessed but at the same time- till date-I cant understand how I could walk so fast for one hour when I dint have even a bit of energy to stand onmy own legs(no water no glucose no gatorade)?<br />    I nearly saw a miracle in the same trip. One of my relatives was strungby scorpion on the way. Sivaganga town was 1 hr away. He didnt want to geton a bus(since the veratham would end).. so with the scorpion bite he walked for 1 hr to Siva ganga and went to a clinic(actually they closed the clinic some how we found the doctor)...</p>
<p>    These are things you dont experience in a day to day life. You see Thousands of people walking to Palani. My sister was carrying her 1 year old daughter and walking. Religion and God becomes really essential when you takeup trip like that. Totally different experience for me. To be without TV internet phone and lie down where ever u feel like( I have had short sleeps on the muds in the side of Highways) and eat in places u will never dream of in normal days.</p>
<p>    Its one place u realize there is some thing more than self confidence. When you lose ur self confidence you solely depend on GOD to move further. I experienced it and till date it is a memorable trip in my life.</p>

<p>      ? <br />      The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a strategy for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places youcan do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your feet is what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has nothing to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs :))</p>

<p>                    Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faith<br />              and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of<br />              accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the appeal does<br />              not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn woundson person's<br />              feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be<br />              anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons suchas these.</p>
<p>                    There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not<br />              possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                      On sharing the contents of this mail in some other group, I<br />              received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                      The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark of<br />              unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked by the<br />              Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worship in Tamil<br />              nadu..</p>
<p>                      But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique" practice<br />              separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism is highly<br />              flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style of<br />              viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not as whole<br />              and holistic..</p>
<p>                      In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is indicative<br />              of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped durign this<br />              festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthiamman, Kali<br />              amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman, Draupadi<br />              amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites*all these<br />              ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy and<br />              great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />              Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which ispart of<br />              Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take literally<br />              thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her devotees in<br />              each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised. Mariamman is<br />              mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi Devi in<br />              these verses!</p>
<p>                      ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is Shiva's<br />              emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. andin most of<br />              the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers shout<br />              "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the poster say<br />              that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktism and<br />              Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                      Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that trasncends the<br />              ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so blatantly<br />              visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* thatcalls for<br />              great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                      friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the<br />              forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                      last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in<br />              chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner<br />              temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in<br />              chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                      no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people<br />              than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the<br />              remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                      the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam,<br />              karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of<br />              these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from<br />              the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these<br />              people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                      a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the<br />              masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                      mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has<br />              not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves<br />              in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements<br />              have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamilcommunity.</p>
<p>                      hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by andlarge in<br />              tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />                      i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district<br />              pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>                      in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years<br />              of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>    Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social compulsions and<br />    or?for acceptance?without semblance of?adherence to devotion, even though<br />    they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />    midhi'?or?shiates' who engage in self beating?bloody on the tenthday<br />    of?'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else. The performers<br />    no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.</p>
<p>    There was only one?Kannappa nayanar we?know?of<br />    symbolizing?unconditional?adoration to the?Lord he believed and nursed by<br />    culling his one eye. We also know that?the Lord came to stop him fromdoing<br />    further self infliction.</p>
<p>    'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>    The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a strategy<br />    for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety<br />    measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places you<br />    can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your feet is<br />    what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has nothing<br />    to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs:))</p>

<p>             Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be like an<br />           acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is relative. I can<br />           never dare<br />           to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt.</p>

<p>                 Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                 unflinching faith<br />           and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of<br />           accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the<br />           appeal does<br />           not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on<br />           person's<br />           feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests<br />           may be<br />           anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as<br />           these.</p>
<p>                 There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not<br />           possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                   On sharing the contents of this mail in some other group, I<br />           received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                   The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark<br />                   of<br />           unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mockedby<br />           the<br />           Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worship in<br />           Tamil<br />           nadu..</p>
<p>                   But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique"<br />                   practice<br />           separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduismis<br />           highly<br />           flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style<br />           of<br />           viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not<br />           as whole<br />           and holistic..</p>
<p>                   In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is<br />                   indicative<br />           of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped<br />           durign this<br />           festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi amman,<br />           Kali<br />           amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman,<br />           Draupadi<br />           amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all<br />           these<br />           ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy<br />           and<br />           great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />           Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part<br />           of<br />           Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take<br />           literally<br />           thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her<br />           devotees in<br />           each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />           Mariamman is<br />           mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi<br />           Devi in<br />           these verses!</p>
<p>                   ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is<br />                   Shiva's<br />           emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in<br />           most of<br />           the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers<br />           shout<br />           "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the<br />           poster say<br />           that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktism<br />           and<br />           Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                   Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                   trasncends the<br />           ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so<br />           blatantly<br />           visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that calls<br />           for<br />           great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                   friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event<br />                   on the<br />           forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                   last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                   walking) in<br />           chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street<br />           corner<br />           temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />           temples in<br />           chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                   no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the<br />                   people<br />           than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers.<br />           only the<br />           remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                   the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam<br />                   oorvalam,<br />           karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />           halmark of<br />           these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />           mostly from<br />           the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among<br />           these<br />           people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                   a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of<br />                   the<br />           masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                   mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition<br />                   which has<br />           not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />           christian waves<br />           in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious<br />           movements<br />           have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />           community.</p>
<p>                   hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large<br />                   in<br />           tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />           ofcourse.<br />                   i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural<br />                   district<br />           pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn<br />           hills.</p>
<p>                   in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500<br />                   years<br />           of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>I was merely responding to one of the comments made by Srinivasan Natarajanon the subject- "The term true devotion itself is relative. I can never dare to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt."? </p>
<p>The points I was trying to make?are-</p>
<p>a. Kannappar (and the?alike) demonstrated?unconditional, single minded and?steadfast devotion that surpassed physical sufferings.? The relation was one to one with the Lord who tested?his devout commitment?to the cause.? ??It is?also true in each one of the stories of Nayanars (?thanks for your some references to the 63 you have made ).? </p>
<p>Once tested, and proved of his sterling devotion, Kannappa?was stopped from culling out his second eye-</p>
<p>??? ??? ??? " thangan mun ida-k-kung kaiai-th-thadu-k-ka moondradu-k-ku naaga<br />??????????????kanganar amudavar-k-kuk ' Kannappa nirka'? endra... "</p>
<p>??? Leading to my second point -</p>
<p>b. Physical suffering is not the only?measure of true devotion.</p>
<p>c. 'thee midi' rituals can't be compared to devotions exemplified by the?likes of Kannappa. </p>
<p>Ms. Malathi,?thanks for your?clarification; it is?indeed difficult to?make?a?distinction of group?fervor influenced by social compulsions?from true devotion. </p>
<p>In my humble opinion?neither physical?sufferings?demonstrate devotion,?nor scriptures prescribe?them as atonement.?</p>
<p>Your reference to cleaning murky mind is life long sojourn, to realize thatmind needs cleaning being the first mile stone. </p>
<p>Sri. Vairam's story is touching demonstration of faith and conviction. Such?experience with divinity?could be best cherished?by the individuals who undergo the encounters.</p>

<p>? <br />Hi Malathi</p>
<p>If you notice I did not say ` great', only feats. They were judged and inducted into the hall of fame ( by who - venkat has asked this question many time). To understand why and what were the criteria etc, needs a measure, judgement and understanding that a contemporary yardstick will not do justice. </p>
<p>I was only wanting to highlight the rest of the elite group as a reply to below statement by our good member and that there are many more such feats in tiruthondarthogai. </p>
<p>" here was only one?Kannappa nayanar we?know?of symbolizing?uncondit ional adoration to the?Lord he believed and nursed by culling his one eye."</p>

<p>I think on terms with Sri TMS that some of these are social compulsions andsome are pure fervour that is hard to categorize. I think things like 'pillai kari' are not things one should eulogize in these times and age. It is also somewhat indicative of our own double standards isn't it not ..we think Jayadeva's example of a woman risking adultery to prove her love to the lord is obscene but we think a man cooking his child to prove is devotion isa great feat???</p>

<p>     Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social compulsionsand<br />     or?for acceptance?without semblance of?adherence to devotion, even though<br />     they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />     midhi'?or?shiates' who engage in self beating?bloody on the tenth day<br />     of?'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else. The performers<br />     no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.</p>
<p>     There was only one?Kannappa nayanar we?know?of<br />     symbolizing?uncondit ional?adoration to the?Lord he believed andnursed by<br />     culling his one eye. We also know that?the Lord came to stop him from doing<br />     further self infliction.</p>
<p>     'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>     The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a strategy<br />     for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety<br />     measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places you<br />     can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your feet is<br />     what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has nothing<br />     to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs :))</p>

<p>          I remember watching a program in Discovery - Myth Busters - regarding<br />          this<br />          'thee midhi'.<br />          They demonstrated that, if a person walks quickly, may be a sort of<br />          slow<br />          sprint on the burning charcoal, nothing happens..may be a few blisters<br />          but<br />          nothing serious would happen.</p>
<p>          If we notice, most of these rituals, people will run and dont walk<br />          slowly<br />          for 5 mins, singing song as they show in karagatakaran.</p>

<p>              Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be like an<br />            acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is relative. I can<br />            never dare<br />            to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt.</p>

<p>                  Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                  unflinching faith<br />            and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lotof<br />            accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the<br />            appeal does<br />            not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on<br />            person's<br />            feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests<br />            may be<br />            anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as<br />            these.</p>
<p>                  There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith isnot<br />            possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                    On sharing the contents of this mail in some other group, I<br />            received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                    The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark<br />                    of<br />            unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked by<br />            the<br />            Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worship in<br />            Tamil<br />            nadu..</p>
<p>                    But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique"<br />                    practice<br />            separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism is<br />            highly<br />            flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style<br />            of<br />            viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not<br />            as whole<br />            and holistic..</p>
<p>                    In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is<br />                    indicative<br />            of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped<br />            durign this<br />            festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi amman,<br />            Kali<br />            amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman,<br />            Draupadi<br />            amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all<br />            these<br />            ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy<br />            and<br />            great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />            Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part<br />            of<br />            Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take<br />            literally<br />            thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her<br />            devotees in<br />            each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />            Mariamman is<br />            mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi<br />            Devi in<br />            these verses!</p>
<p>                    ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is<br />                    Shiva's<br />            emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in<br />            most of<br />            the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers<br />            shout<br />            "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the<br />            poster say<br />            that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktism<br />            and<br />            Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                    Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                    trasncends the<br />            ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so<br />            blatantly<br />            visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that calls<br />            for<br />            great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                    friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event<br />                    on the<br />            forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                    last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                    walking) in<br />            chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street<br />            corner<br />            temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />            temples in<br />            chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                    no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the<br />                    people<br />            than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers.<br />            only the<br />            remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                    the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam<br />                    oorvalam,<br />            karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />            halmark of<br />            these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />            mostly from<br />            the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among<br />            these<br />            people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                    a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of<br />                    the<br />            masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                    mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition<br />                    which has<br />            not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />            christian waves<br />            in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious<br />            movements<br />            have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />            community.</p>
<p>                    hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large<br />                    in<br />            tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />            ofcourse.<br />                    i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural<br />                    district<br />            pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn<br />            hills.</p>
<p>                    in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500<br />                    years<br />            of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

        <p>Hi VJ, I didnt' mean 'you' called it great feat, you only highlighted the feats which are normally deemed great, it just occured to me since we just talked of Jayadeva and the Radha story a while ago, the parellels between moral judgements that is all.</p>
<p>Thank you !!</p>

<p>  If you notice I did not say *` great'*, only feats. They were judged and<br />  inducted into the hall of fame ( by who - venkat has asked this question<br />  many time).

<p>    I think on terms with Sri TMS that some of these are social compulsionsand<br />    some are pure fervour that is hard to categorize. I think things like<br />    'pillai kari' are not things one should eulogize in these times and age. It<br />    is also somewhat indicative of our own double standards isn't it not ..we<br />    think Jayadeva's example of a woman risking adultery to prove her love to<br />    the lord is obscene but we think a man cooking his child to prove is<br />    devotion is a great feat???</p>

Several bloody sacrificial practices were<br />    common<br />        during Hindu religious rituals ( tantric sacrificial rituals) in the<br />    period<br />        of social and religious rudderless-ness and vacuum when Buddism and<br />    Jainism<br />        reached their nadir points. The religious practices were given<br />    direction<br />        and attained restoration thorugh the preachings of reformers such as<br />    Adi<br />        Shankara in the 8 th century . Several obnoxious practices such as Sati<br />    (<br />        co-cremation of widows along with diseased husbands ) continued<br />    socially<br />        well into 19th Century until it was legally banned by the British in<br />    Bengal<br />        around 1829. We know of a few occurrences even during our present<br />    times.</tmsunder@></p>
<p>        Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social compulsions<br />    and<br />        or for acceptance without semblance of adherence to devotion, even<br />    though<br />        they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />        midhi' or shiates' who engage in self beating bloody on the tenth day<br />        of 'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else. The<br />    performers<br />        no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.</p>
<p>        There was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of<br />        symbolizing unconditional adoration to the Lord he believed and nursed<br />    by<br />        culling his one eye. We also know that the Lord came to stop him from<br />    doing<br />        further self infliction.</p>
<p>        'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>        The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a<br />    strategy<br />        for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety<br />        measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places<br />    you<br />        can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your<br />    feet is<br />        what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has<br />    nothing<br />        to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs<br />    :))</p>

<p>                     Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                     unflinching faith<br />               and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot<br />    of<br />               accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the<br />               appeal does<br />               not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on<br />               person's<br />               feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK<br />    protests<br />               may be<br />               anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as<br />               these.</p>
<p>                     There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faithis<br />    not<br />               possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                       The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a<br />    hallmark<br />                       of<br />               unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked<br />    by<br />               the<br />               Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti<br />    worship in<br />               Tamil<br />               nadu..</p>
<p>                       But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some<br />    "unique"<br />                       practice<br />               separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism<br />    is<br />               highly<br />               flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial<br />    style<br />               of<br />               viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and<br />    not<br />               as whole<br />               and holistic..</p>
<p>                       In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritualis<br />                       indicative<br />               of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped<br />               durign this<br />               festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi<br />    amman,<br />               Kali<br />               amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman,<br />               Draupadi<br />               amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites*<br />    all<br />               these<br />               ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep<br />    philosophy<br />               and<br />               great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called<br />    Durga<br />               Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is<br />    part<br />               of<br />               Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take<br />               literally<br />               thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to blessher<br />               devotees in<br />               each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />               Mariamman is<br />               mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as<br />    Vaishnavi<br />               Devi in<br />               these verses!</p>
<p>                       ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that<br />    is<br />                       Shiva's<br />               emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in<br />               most of<br />               the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the<br />    firewalkers<br />               shout<br />               "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how doesthe<br />               poster say<br />               that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism,<br />    Shaktism<br />               and<br />               Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                       Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                       trasncends the<br />               ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is<br />    so<br />               blatantly<br />               visible in other religions/cultures. .

<p>                       friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice<br />    event<br />                       on the<br />               forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                       last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                       walking) in<br />               chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the<br />    street<br />               corner<br />               temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />               temples in<br />               chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                       no other religious occasion is so deeply attached tothe<br />                       people<br />               than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman<br />    followers.<br />               only the<br />               remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                       the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal<br />    kudam<br />                       oorvalam,<br />               karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />               halmark of<br />               these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />               mostly from<br />               the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness<br />    among<br />               these<br />               people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                       a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation<br />    of<br />                       the<br />               masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                       mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition<br />                       which has<br />               not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />               christian waves<br />               in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious<br />               movements<br />               have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />               community.</p>
<p>                       hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and<br />    large<br />                       in<br />               tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />               ofcourse.<br />                       i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural<br />                       district<br />               pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of<br />    kalvarayn<br />               hills.</p>
<p>                       in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after<br />    2500<br />                       years<br />               of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi</p>
<p>If you notice I did not say *` great'*, only feats. They were judged and<br />inducted into the hall of fame ( by who - venkat has asked this question<br />many time). To understand why and what were the criteria etc, needs a<br />measure, judgement and understanding that a contemporary yardstick will not<br />do justice.</p>
<p>I was only wanting to highlight the rest of the elite group as a reply to<br />below statement by our good member and that there are many more such feats<br />in tiruthondarthogai.</p>

<blockquote><p>  I think on terms with Sri TMS that some of these are social compulsions and<br />  some are pure fervour that is hard to categorize. I think things like<br />  'pillai kari' are not things one should eulogize in these times and age. It<br />  is also somewhat indicative of our own double standards isn't it not ..we<br />  think Jayadeva's example of a woman risking adultery to prove her love to<br />  the lord is obscene but we think a man cooking his child to prove is<br />  devotion is a great feat???</p>

<p>    Hi</p>
<p>    There is only one kannappar !!! Hmm, that's the pity, the 63 adorn the<br />    quiet sides of our temples and we are not aware of their feats.<br />    Oferring own hair as a wick, grinding ones elbow for sandal wood,<br />    letting even an assasin go, wanting to give up his life when the king<br />    finds his war killed one saint !!, pillai kari ( oferring own child's<br />    meat), tonsuring his daughter on the eve of her marriage ....how many<br />    you want</p>

Several bloody sacrificial practices were<br />  common<br />      during Hindu religious rituals ( tantric sacrificial rituals) in the<br />  period<br />      of social and religious rudderless-ness and vacuum when Buddism and<br />  Jainism<br />      reached their nadir points. The religious practices were given<br />  direction<br />      and attained restoration thorugh the preachings of reformers such as<br />  Adi<br />      Shankara in the 8 th century . Several obnoxious practices such as Sati<br />  (<br />      co-cremation of widows along with diseased husbands ) continued<br />  socially<br />      well into 19th Century until it was legally banned by the British in<br />  Bengal<br />      around 1829. We know of a few occurrences even during our present<br />  times.</tmsunder@...></p>
<p>      Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social compulsions<br />  and<br />      or for acceptance without semblance of adherence to devotion, even<br />  though<br />      they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />      midhi' or shiates' who engage in self beating bloody on the tenth day<br />      of 'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else. The<br />  performers<br />      no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.</p>
<p>      There was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of<br />      symbolizing unconditional adoration to the Lord he believed and nursed<br />  by<br />      culling his one eye. We also know that the Lord came to stop him from<br />  doing<br />      further self infliction.</p>
<p>      'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>      The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a<br />  strategy<br />      for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety<br />      measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places<br />  you<br />      can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your<br />  feet is<br />      what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has<br />  nothing<br />      to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs<br />  :))</p>

<p>           I remember watching a program in Discovery - Myth Busters -<br />  regarding<br />           this<br />           'thee midhi'.<br />           They demonstrated that, if a person walks quickly, may be a sort<br />  of<br />           slow<br />           sprint on the burning charcoal, nothing happens..may be a few<br />  blisters<br />           but<br />           nothing serious would happen.</p>
<p>           If we notice, most of these rituals, people will run and dont walk<br />           slowly<br />           for 5 mins, singing song as they show in karagatakaran.</p>

It is not<br />  related<br />             to<br />             authentic devotion in the least and those of us who believe also<br />             must<br />             strongly discourage.</p>

<p>                   Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                   unflinching faith<br />             and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot<br />  of<br />             accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the<br />             appeal does<br />             not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on<br />             person's<br />             feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK<br />  protests<br />             may be<br />             anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as<br />             these.</p>
<p>                   There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is<br />  not<br />             possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                     On sharing the contents of this mail in some other<br />  group, I<br />             received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                     The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a<br />  hallmark<br />                     of<br />             unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked<br />  by<br />             the<br />             Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti<br />  worship in<br />             Tamil<br />             nadu..</p>
<p>                     But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some<br />  "unique"<br />                     practice<br />             separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism<br />  is<br />             highly<br />             flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial<br />  style<br />             of<br />             viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and<br />  not<br />             as whole<br />             and holistic..</p>
<p>                     In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is<br />                     indicative<br />             of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped<br />             durign this<br />             festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi<br />  amman,<br />             Kali<br />             amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman,<br />             Draupadi<br />             amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites*<br />  all<br />             these<br />             ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep<br />  philosophy<br />             and<br />             great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called<br />  Durga<br />             Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is<br />  part<br />             of<br />             Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take<br />             literally<br />             thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her<br />             devotees in<br />             each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />             Mariamman is<br />             mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as<br />  Vaishnavi<br />             Devi in<br />             these verses!</p>
<p>                     ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that<br />  is<br />                     Shiva's<br />             emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in<br />             most of<br />             the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the<br />  firewalkers<br />             shout<br />             "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the<br />             poster say<br />             that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism,<br />  Shaktism<br />             and<br />             Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                     Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                     trasncends the<br />             ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is<br />  so<br />             blatantly<br />             visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that<br />  calls<br />             for<br />             great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                     friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice<br />  event<br />                     on the<br />             forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                     last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                     walking) in<br />             chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the<br />  street<br />             corner<br />             temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />             temples in<br />             chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                     no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the<br />                     people<br />             than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman<br />  followers.<br />             only the<br />             remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                     the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal<br />  kudam<br />                     oorvalam,<br />             karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />             halmark of<br />             these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />             mostly from<br />             the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness<br />  among<br />             these<br />             people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                     a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation<br />  of<br />                     the<br />             masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                     mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition<br />                     which has<br />             not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />             christian waves<br />             in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious<br />             movements<br />             have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />             community.</p>
<p>                     hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and<br />  large<br />                     in<br />             tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />             ofcourse.<br />                     i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural<br />                     district<br />             pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of<br />  kalvarayn<br />             hills.</p>
<p>                     in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after<br />  2500<br />                     years<br />             of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

        <p>I think on terms with Sri TMS that some of these are social compulsions andsome are pure fervour that is hard to categorize. I think things like 'pillai kari' are not things one should eulogize in these times and age. It is also somewhat indicative of our own double standards isn't it not ..we think Jayadeva's example of a woman risking adultery to prove her love to the lord is obscene but we think a man cooking his child to prove is devotion isa great feat???</p>

<p>    Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social compulsions and<br />    or?for acceptance?without semblance of?adherence to devotion, even though<br />    they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />    midhi'?or?shiates' who engage in self beating?bloody on the tenthday<br />    of?'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else.

<p>    The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a strategy<br />    for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety<br />    measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places you<br />    can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your feet is<br />    what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has nothing<br />    to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs:))</p>

<p>           Dear Natarajan, I didn't mean all forms of extreme devotion as<br />           'stunt'<br />           sorry for the misunderstanding, I only deem them unnecessary. Just<br />           fyi to<br />           you a huge number of thee midhis are used as stunts almost arranged<br />           like<br />           circus with an organiser and participant, soon after the<br />           participants are<br />           whisked away so that audience does not see any injuries on her foot.<br />           Usually<br />           these are very poor women doing it for a living.

<p>             Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be like an<br />           acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is relative. I can<br />           never dare<br />           to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt.</p>

<p>             I agree what Venkat says, all forms of beliefs including athiesm<br />             CO EXIST<br />           for a reason they compliment and validate one another in various<br />           ways.</p>
<p>             Secondly true devotion is beyonds stunts or even miracles - in<br />             other<br />           words the real 'thee' is actually courage to face life challenges<br />           and come<br />           out successfully not show other people you can walk on fire - with<br />           or<br />           without assistance of God.</p>

<p>                 Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                 unflinching faith<br />           and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of<br />           accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the<br />           appeal does<br />           not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on<br />           person's<br />           feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests<br />           may be<br />           anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as<br />           these.</p>
<p>                 There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not<br />           possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                   On sharing the contents of this mail in some other group, I<br />           received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                   The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark<br />                   of<br />           unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mockedby<br />           the<br />           Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worship in<br />           Tamil<br />           nadu..</p>
<p>                   But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique"<br />                   practice<br />           separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduismis<br />           highly<br />           flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style<br />           of<br />           viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not<br />           as whole<br />           and holistic..</p>
<p>                   In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is<br />                   indicative<br />           of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped<br />           durign this<br />           festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi amman,<br />           Kali<br />           amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman,<br />           Draupadi<br />           amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all<br />           these<br />           ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy<br />           and<br />           great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />           Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part<br />           of<br />           Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take<br />           literally<br />           thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her<br />           devotees in<br />           each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />           Mariamman is<br />           mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi<br />           Devi in<br />           these verses!</p>
<p>                   ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is<br />                   Shiva's<br />           emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in<br />           most of<br />           the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers<br />           shout<br />           "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the<br />           poster say<br />           that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktism<br />           and<br />           Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                   Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                   trasncends the<br />           ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so<br />           blatantly<br />           visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that calls<br />           for<br />           great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                   friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event<br />                   on the<br />           forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                   last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                   walking) in<br />           chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street<br />           corner<br />           temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />           temples in<br />           chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                   no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the<br />                   people<br />           than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers.<br />           only the<br />           remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                   the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam<br />                   oorvalam,<br />           karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />           halmark of<br />           these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />           mostly from<br />           the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among<br />           these<br />           people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                   a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of<br />                   the<br />           masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                   mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition<br />                   which has<br />           not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />           christian waves<br />           in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious<br />           movements<br />           have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />           community.</p>
<p>                   hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large<br />                   in<br />           tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />           ofcourse.<br />                   i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural<br />                   district<br />           pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn<br />           hills.</p>
<p>                   in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500<br />                   years<br />           of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Vairam, what a nice inspiring story!! Mine is somewhat similar, we <br />  used to walk from our home in Kovai up Marudamalai which is <br />  equivalent to Palani in terms of height and steeper as I understand.</p>
<p>  My understanding of such feats has changed/matured and continues to <br />  grow over time. The best way i can put it as of now is that - the <br />  modern mind is not easily freed from thought. Thought as many <br />  spiritual teachings say is the biggest barrier to experiencing <br />  divine grace. When you put your body through extreme exhaustion the <br />  mind gives up thinking. So you have direct access to the great <br />  divine energy out there that can lift you body and spirit in <br />  miraculous ways. The difference between extreme expereinces that <br />  involve personal achievement (say such as scaling high peaks) and <br />  experiences with religious base is that the second allows for the <br />  mind to give up thought and surrender to what is there. Most high <br />  acheivers who are exhausted are unable to surrender the mind and <br />  many times succumb to their exhaustion - many others realize the <br />  limits of human thought this way and experience what may be their <br />  first ever spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>  This is not an understanding that even requires any belief in <br />  religion or God although that belief makes it much simpler :))<br />  Malathi</p>

<p>    Every year people walk from my native Devakottai to Palani(175 km <br />  - 7 days walk) during Thaipusam. When I was in my college second <br />  year I walked this pathayathirai.<br />    Very good experience, Practically even the strongest man cant have <br />  stamina to walk the distance without pain. I was first timer I <br />  couldnt walk at all. It was impossible. That one of the rare time I <br />  realised it it requires some thing more than self confidence to walk <br />  the distane. It surely needed the drive, the ferocity and religious <br />  fervour. The songs sung by people while they walk esp there is one <br />  song 'Karupar Paatu' which just makes u violent. I have experienced <br />  it my self. I was done and out( I have flat foot a deformity which <br />  causes pain in the bones above the heels if you walk for long). <br />  Still some 3-4 miles were left in the days walk, it was around 10Pm <br />  in the night.<br />    I was about to fall two people caught me on their shoulders and I <br />  totally knew I couldn't walk even for a min. Two guys held me and <br />  one person with his powerful voice started singing the Karupar <br />  paatu(the song is supposed to be very powerful..when ever this song <br />  is sung some ladies get the frenzy while going on padyatra)..the <br />  song had some vibrations...I could nt open my eyes , I was still <br />  tired ..but my legs walked. After a while we reached the destination.<br />    When we reached the destination all people said I got'Saami' and I <br />  was walking really fast like as if I was possessed. Only thing I <br />  knew was I wasnt possessed but at the same time- till date-I cant <br />  understand how I could walk so fast for one hour when I dint have <br />  even a bit of energy to stand on my own legs(no water no glucose no <br />  gatorade)?<br />    I nearly saw a miracle in the same trip. One of my relatives was <br />  strung by scorpion on the way. Sivaganga town was 1 hr away. He <br />  didnt want to get on a bus(since the veratham would end).. so with <br />  the scorpion bite he walked for 1 hr to Siva ganga and went to a <br />  clinic(actually they closed the clinic some how we found the <br />  doctor)...</p>
<p>    These are things you dont experience in a day to day life. You see <br />  Thousands of people walking to Palani. My sister was carrying her 1 <br />  year old daughter and walking. Religion and God becomes really <br />  essential when you take up trip like that. Totally different <br />  experience for me. To be without TV internet phone and lie down <br />  where ever u feel like( I have had short sleeps on the muds in the <br />  side of Highways) and eat in places u will never dream of in normal <br />  days.</p>
<p>    Its one place u realize there is some thing more than self <br />  confidence. When you lose ur self confidence you solely depend on <br />  GOD to move further. I experienced it and till date it is a <br />  memorable trip in my life.</p>

<p>      Sacrificial rituals have been part of Hinduism from time <br />  immemorial, we hear about how penances were performed by tenacious <br />  boon seekers sacrificing limbs or even human lives. Several bloody <br />  sacrificial practices were common during Hindu religious rituals <br />  ( tantric sacrificial rituals) in the period of social and <br />  religious rudderless-ness and vacuum when Buddism and Jainism <br />  reached their nadir points. The religious practices were given <br />  direction and attained restoration thorugh the preachings of <br />  reformers such as Adi Shankara in the 8 th century . Several <br />  obnoxious practices such as Sati ( co-cremation of widows along with <br />  diseased husbands ) continued socially well into 19th Century until <br />  it was legally banned by the British in Bengal around 1829. We know <br />  of a few occurrences even during our present times.</p>
<p>      Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social <br />  compulsions and or for acceptance without semblance of adherence to <br />  devotion, even though they are colored of religious connotation. <br />  Participants of 'Thee midhi' or shiates' who engage in self beating <br />  bloody on the tenth day of 'moharram' have more fervor and less of <br />  everything else. The performers no doubt end up in risking bodily <br />  injuries.</p>
<p>      There was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of symbolizing <br />  unconditional adoration to the Lord he believed and nursed by <br />  culling his one eye. We also know that the Lord came to stop him <br />  from doing further self infliction.</p>
<p>      'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>      The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a <br />  strategy for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with <br />  appropraite safety measures attached. If you walk very fast and step <br />  in the right places you can do it but if one coal decides to turn up <br />  and burn brightly your feet is what it needs to feed on. All said <br />  and done in present day this has nothing to do with devotion so <br />  perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs :))</p>

<p>            I remember watching a program in Discovery - Myth Busters <br />  - regarding this<br />            'thee midhi'.<br />            They demonstrated that, if a person walks quickly, may be <br />  a sort of slow<br />            sprint on the burning charcoal, nothing happens..may be a <br />  few blisters but<br />            nothing serious would happen.</p>
<p>            If we notice, most of these rituals, people will run and <br />  dont walk slowly<br />            for 5 mins, singing song as they show in karagatakaran.</p>

Just fyi to<br />              you a huge number of thee midhis are used as stunts <br />  almost arranged like<br />              circus with an organiser and participant, soon after the <br />  participants are<br />              whisked away so that audience does not see any injuries <br />  on her foot. Usually<br />              these are very poor women doing it for a living. It is <br />  not related to<br />              authentic devotion in the least and those of us who <br />  believe also must<br />              strongly discourage.</p>

<p>                Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be <br />  like an<br />              acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is <br />  relative. I can never dare<br />              to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt.</p>

<p>                    Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one <br />  of unflinching faith<br />              and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead <br />  to lot of<br />              accidents, often times hidden to the general public so <br />  that the appeal does<br />              not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn <br />  wounds on person's<br />              feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman <br />  Thiruvizha.DK protests may be<br />              anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons <br />  such as these.</p>
<p>                    There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure <br />  faith is not<br />              possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                      On sharing the contents of this mail in some <br />  other group, I<br />              received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                      The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - <br />  a hallmark of<br />              unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, <br />  usually mocked by the<br />              Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of <br />  Shakti worship in Tamil<br />              nadu..</p>
<p>                      But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some <br />  "unique" practice<br />              separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream <br />  Hinduism is highly<br />              flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- <br />  colonial style of<br />              viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and <br />  fragment and not as whole<br />              and holistic..</p>
<p>                      In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi <br />  ritual is indicative<br />              of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is <br />  worshipped durign this<br />              festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. <br />  Sakthi amman, Kali<br />              amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, <br />  Thirumani amman, Draupadi<br />              amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that <br />  *unites* all these<br />              ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a <br />  deep philosophy and<br />              great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also <br />  called Durga<br />              Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship <br />  which is part of<br />              Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi <br />  will take literally<br />              thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to <br />  bless her devotees in<br />              each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also <br />  praised. Mariamman is<br />              mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath <br />  as Vaishnavi Devi in<br />              these verses!</p>
<p>                      ... every one of these Amman temple has <br />  Trishulam that is Shiva's<br />              emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's <br />  mount .. and in most of<br />              the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the <br />  firewalkers shout<br />              "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how <br />  does the poster say<br />              that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by <br />  Shaivism, Shaktism and<br />              Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                      Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma <br />  that trasncends the<br />              ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" <br />  that is so blatantly<br />              visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* <br />  that calls for<br />              great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                      friends, i congratulate the members and wish <br />  them nice event on the<br />              forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in <br />  future.</p>
<p>                      last 30 days there were a series of thee <br />  midhis(fire walking) in<br />              chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from <br />  the street corner<br />              temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 <br />  amman temples in<br />              chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                      no other religious occasion is so deeply <br />  attached to the people<br />              than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman <br />  followers. only the<br />              remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                      the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, <br />  pal kudam oorvalam,<br />              karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari <br />  songs)are halmark of<br />              these festives. women involvement is maximum. the <br />  devotees are mostly from<br />              the downtrodden communities. i have not found th <br />  seriousness among these<br />              people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                      a true occasion of collective unconscious <br />  assimilation of the<br />              masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho- <br />  analysis.</p>
<p>                      mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing <br />  tradition which has<br />              not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, <br />  islam or christian waves<br />              in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal <br />  religious movements<br />              have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of <br />  tamil community.</p>
<p>                      hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned <br />  by and large in<br />              tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero <br />  worshiping ofcourse.<br />                      i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in <br />  salem rural district<br />              pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines <br />  of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>                      in all these mother god worshiping is that stays <br />  after 2500 years<br />              of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>  My understanding of such feats has changed/matured and continues to <br />  grow over time. The best way i can put it as of now is that - the <br />  modern mind is not easily freed from thought. Thought as many <br />  spiritual teachings say is the biggest barrier to experiencing <br />  divine grace. When you put your body through extreme exhaustion the <br />  mind gives up thinking. So you have direct access to the great <br />  divine energy out there that can lift you body and spirit in <br />  miraculous ways. The difference between extreme expereinces that <br />  involve personal achievement (say such as scaling high peaks) and <br />  experiences with religious base is that the second allows for the <br />  mind to give up thought and surrender to what is there. Most high <br />  acheivers who are exhausted are unable to surrender the mind and <br />  many times succumb to their exhaustion - many others realize the <br />  limits of human thought this way and experience what may be their <br />  first ever spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>  This is not an understanding that even requires any belief in <br />  religion or God although that belief makes it much simpler :))<br />  Malathi</p>

I was first timer I <br />  couldnt walk at all. It was impossible. That one of the rare time I <br />  realised it it requires some thing more than self confidence to walk <br />  the distane. It surely needed the drive, the ferocity and religious <br />  fervour. The songs sung by people while they walk esp there is one <br />  song 'Karupar Paatu' which just makes u violent. I have experienced <br />  it my self. I was done and out( I have flat foot a deformity which <br />  causes pain in the bones above the heels if you walk for long). <br />  Still some 3-4 miles were left in the days walk, it was around 10Pm <br />  in the night.<br />    I was about to fall two people caught me on their shoulders and I <br />  totally knew I couldn't walk even for a min. Two guys held me and <br />  one person with his powerful voice started singing the Karupar <br />  paatu(the song is supposed to be very powerful..when ever this song <br />  is sung some ladies get the frenzy while going on padyatra)..the <br />  song had some vibrations...I could nt open my eyes , I was still <br />  tired ..but my legs walked. After a while we reached the destination.<br />    When we reached the destination all people said I got'Saami' and I <br />  was walking really fast like as if I was possessed. Only thing I <br />  knew was I wasnt possessed but at the same time- till date-I cant <br />  understand how I could walk so fast for one hour when I dint have <br />  even a bit of energy to stand on my own legs(no water no glucose no <br />  gatorade)?<br />    I nearly saw a miracle in the same trip. One of my relatives was <br />  strung by scorpion on the way. Sivaganga town was 1 hr away. He <br />  didnt want to get on a bus(since the veratham would end).. so with <br />  the scorpion bite he walked for 1 hr to Siva ganga and went to a <br />  clinic(actually they closed the clinic some how we found the <br />  doctor)...</p>
<p>    These are things you dont experience in a day to day life. You see <br />  Thousands of people walking to Palani. My sister was carrying her 1 <br />  year old daughter and walking. Religion and God becomes really <br />  essential when you take up trip like that. Totally different <br />  experience for me. To be without TV internet phone and lie down <br />  where ever u feel like( I have had short sleeps on the muds in the <br />  side of Highways) and eat in places u will never dream of in normal <br />  days.</p>
<p>    Its one place u realize there is some thing more than self <br />  confidence. When you lose ur self confidence you solely depend on <br />  GOD to move further. I experienced it and till date it is a <br />  memorable trip in my life.</p>

<p>      Sacrificial rituals have been part of Hinduism from time <br />  immemorial, we hear about how penances were performed by tenacious <br />  boon seekers sacrificing limbs or even human lives. Several bloody <br />  sacrificial practices were common during Hindu religious rituals <br />  ( tantric sacrificial rituals) in the period of social and <br />  religious rudderless-ness and vacuum when Buddism and Jainism <br />  reached their nadir points. The religious practices were given <br />  direction and attained restoration thorugh the preachings of <br />  reformers such as Adi Shankara in the 8 th century . Several <br />  obnoxious practices such as Sati ( co-cremation of widows along with <br />  diseased husbands ) continued socially well into 19th Century until <br />  it was legally banned by the British in Bengal around 1829. We know <br />  of a few occurrences even during our present times.</p>
<p>      Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social <br />  compulsions and or for acceptance without semblance of adherence to <br />  devotion, even though they are colored of religious connotation. <br />  Participants of 'Thee midhi' or shiates' who engage in self beating <br />  bloody on the tenth day of 'moharram' have more fervor and less of <br />  everything else. The performers no doubt end up in risking bodily <br />  injuries.</p>
<p>      There was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of symbolizing <br />  unconditional adoration to the Lord he believed and nursed by <br />  culling his one eye. We also know that the Lord came to stop him <br />  from doing further self infliction.</p>
<p>      'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>      The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a <br />  strategy for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with <br />  appropraite safety measures attached. If you walk very fast and step <br />  in the right places you can do it but if one coal decides to turn up <br />  and burn brightly your feet is what it needs to feed on. All said <br />  and done in present day this has nothing to do with devotion so <br />  perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs :))</p>

<p>            I remember watching a program in Discovery - Myth Busters <br />  - regarding this<br />            'thee midhi'.<br />            They demonstrated that, if a person walks quickly, may be <br />  a sort of slow<br />            sprint on the burning charcoal, nothing happens..may be a <br />  few blisters but<br />            nothing serious would happen.</p>
<p>            If we notice, most of these rituals, people will run and <br />  dont walk slowly<br />            for 5 mins, singing song as they show in karagatakaran.</p>

Just fyi to<br />              you a huge number of thee midhis are used as stunts <br />  almost arranged like<br />              circus with an organiser and participant, soon after the <br />  participants are<br />              whisked away so that audience does not see any injuries <br />  on her foot.

<p>                    Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one <br />  of unflinching faith<br />              and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead <br />  to lot of<br />              accidents, often times hidden to the general public so <br />  that the appeal does<br />              not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn <br />  wounds on person's<br />              feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman <br />  Thiruvizha.DK protests may be<br />              anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons <br />  such as these.</p>
<p>                    There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure <br />  faith is not<br />              possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                      On sharing the contents of this mail in some <br />  other group, I<br />              received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                      The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - <br />  a hallmark of<br />              unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, <br />  usually mocked by the<br />              Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of <br />  Shakti worship in Tamil<br />              nadu..</p>
<p>                      But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some <br />  "unique" practice<br />              separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream <br />  Hinduism is highly<br />              flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- <br />  colonial style of<br />              viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and <br />  fragment and not as whole<br />              and holistic..</p>
<p>                      In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi <br />  ritual is indicative<br />              of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is <br />  worshipped durign this<br />              festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. <br />  Sakthi amman, Kali<br />              amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, <br />  Thirumani amman, Draupadi<br />              amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that <br />  *unites* all these<br />              ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a <br />  deep philosophy and<br />              great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also <br />  called Durga<br />              Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship <br />  which is part of<br />              Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi <br />  will take literally<br />              thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to <br />  bless her devotees in<br />              each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also <br />  praised. Mariamman is<br />              mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath <br />  as Vaishnavi Devi in<br />              these verses!</p>
<p>                      ... every one of these Amman temple has <br />  Trishulam that is Shiva's<br />              emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's <br />  mount .. and in most of<br />              the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the <br />  firewalkers shout<br />              "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how <br />  does the poster say<br />              that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by <br />  Shaivism, Shaktism and<br />              Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                      Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma <br />  that trasncends the<br />              ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" <br />  that is so blatantly<br />              visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* <br />  that calls for<br />              great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                      friends, i congratulate the members and wish <br />  them nice event on the<br />              forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in <br />  future.</p>
<p>                      last 30 days there were a series of thee <br />  midhis(fire walking) in<br />              chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from <br />  the street corner<br />              temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 <br />  amman temples in<br />              chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                      no other religious occasion is so deeply <br />  attached to the people<br />              than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman <br />  followers. only the<br />              remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                      the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, <br />  pal kudam oorvalam,<br />              karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari <br />  songs)are halmark of<br />              these festives. women involvement is maximum. the <br />  devotees are mostly from<br />              the downtrodden communities. i have not found th <br />  seriousness among these<br />              people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                      a true occasion of collective unconscious <br />  assimilation of the<br />              masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho- <br />  analysis.</p>
<p>                      mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing <br />  tradition which has<br />              not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, <br />  islam or christian waves<br />              in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal <br />  religious movements<br />              have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of <br />  tamil community.</p>
<p>                      hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned <br />  by and large in<br />              tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero <br />  worshiping ofcourse.<br />                      i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in <br />  salem rural district<br />              pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines <br />  of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>                      in all these mother god worshiping is that stays <br />  after 2500 years<br />              of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

        <p>Vairam, what a nice inspiring story!! Mine is somewhat similar, we used to walk from our home in Kovai up Marudamalai which is equivalent to Palani interms of height and steeper as I understand.</p>
<p>My understanding of such feats has changed/matured and continues to grow over time. The best way i can put it as of now is that - the modern mind is not easily freed from thought. Thought as many spiritual teachings say is the biggest barrier to experiencing divine grace. When you put your body through extreme exhaustion the mind gives up thinking. So you have direct access to the great divine energy out there that can lift you body and spirit inmiraculous ways. The difference between extreme expereinces that involve personal achievement (say such as scaling high peaks) and experiences with religious base is that the second allows for the mind to give up thought andsurrender to what is there. Most high acheivers who are exhausted are unable to surrender the mind and many times succumb to their exhaustion - many others realize the limits of human thought this way and experience what maybe their first ever spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>This is not an understanding that even requires any belief in religion or God although that belief makes it much simpler :))<br />Malathi</p>

<blockquote><p>  Every year people walk from my native Devakottai to Palani(175 km - 7 days walk) during Thaipusam. When I was in my college second year I walked this pathayathirai.<br />  Very good experience, Practically even the strongest man cant have stamina to walk the distance without pain. I was first timer I couldnt walk at all. It was impossible. That one of the rare time I realised it it requires some thing more than self confidence to walk the distane. It surely needed the drive, the ferocity and religious fervour. The songs sung by people while they walk esp there is one song 'Karupar Paatu' which just makes u violent. I have experienced it my self. I was done and out( I have flat foot a deformity which causes pain in the bones above the heels if you walk for long). Still some 3-4 miles were left in the days walk, it was around 10Pm in the night. <br />  I was about to fall two people caught me on their shoulders and I totallyknew I couldn't walk even for a min. Two guys held me and one person with his powerful voice started singing the Karupar paatu(the song is supposed to be very powerful..when ever this song is sung some ladies get the frenzy while going on padyatra)..the song had some vibrations...I could nt open myeyes , I was still tired ..but my legs walked. After a while we reached the destination.<br />  When we reached the destination all people said I got'Saami' and I was walking really fast like as if I was possessed. Only thing I knew was I wasntpossessed but at the same time- till date-I cant understand how I could walk so fast for one hour when I dint have even a bit of energy to stand on my own legs(no water no glucose no gatorade)?<br />  I nearly saw a miracle in the same trip. One of my relatives was strung by scorpion on the way. Sivaganga town was 1 hr away. He didnt want to get on a bus(since the veratham would end).. so with the scorpion bite he walkedfor 1 hr to Siva ganga and went to a clinic(actually they closed the clinic some how we found the doctor)...</p>
<p>  These are things you dont experience in a day to day life. You see Thousands of people walking to Palani. My sister was carrying her 1 year old daughter and walking. Religion and God becomes really essential when you take up trip like that. Totally different experience for me. To be without TV internet phone and lie down where ever u feel like( I have had short sleeps onthe muds in the side of Highways) and eat in places u will never dream of in normal days.</p>
<p>  Its one place u realize there is some thing more than self confidence. When you lose ur self confidence you solely depend on GOD to move further. I experienced it and till date it is a memorable trip in my life.</p>

<p>    There was only one?Kannappa nayanar we?know?of symbolizing?unconditional?adoration to the?Lord he believed and nursed by culling his one eye. We also know that?the Lord came to stop him from doing further self infliction. </p>

<p>    ? <br />    The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a strategy for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places you can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your feet is what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has nothingto do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs :))</p>

<p>            Dear Natarajan, I didn't mean all forms of extreme devotion as 'stunt'<br />            sorry for the misunderstanding, I only deem them unnecessary. Just fyi to<br />            you a huge number of thee midhis are used as stunts almost arranged like<br />            circus with an organiser and participant, soon after the participants are<br />            whisked away so that audience does not see any injuries on her foot. Usually<br />            these are very poor women doing it for a living. It is not related to<br />            authentic devotion in the least and those of us who believe also must<br />            strongly discourage.</p>

<p>                  Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faith<br />            and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lotof<br />            accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that theappeal does<br />            not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on person's<br />            feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be<br />            anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as these.</p>
<p>                  There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith isnot<br />            possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                    On sharing the contents of this mail in some other group, I<br />            received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                    The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark of<br />            unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked by the<br />            Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worship in Tamil<br />            nadu..</p>
<p>                    But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique" practice<br />            separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism is highly<br />            flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style of<br />            viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not as whole<br />            and holistic..</p>
<p>                    In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual isindicative<br />            of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshippeddurign this<br />            festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi amman, Kali<br />            amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman, Draupadi<br />            amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all these<br />            ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy and<br />            great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />            Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part of<br />            Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take literally<br />            thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her devotees in<br />            each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised. Mariamman is<br />            mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi Devi in<br />            these verses!</p>
<p>                    ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is Shiva's<br />            emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in most of<br />            the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers shout<br />            "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the poster say<br />            that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktism and<br />            Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                    Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that trasncends the<br />            ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so blatantly<br />            visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that calls for<br />            great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                    friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the<br />            forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                    last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in<br />            chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner<br />            temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in<br />            chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                    no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people<br />            than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the<br />            remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                    the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam,<br />            karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of<br />            these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from<br />            the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these<br />            people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                    a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the<br />            masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                    mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has<br />            not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves<br />            in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements<br />            have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>                    hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large in<br />            tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />                    i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district<br />            pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>                    in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years<br />            of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>  'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>  The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a strategy<br />  for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety<br />  measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places you<br />  can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your feet is<br />  what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has nothing<br />  to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs :))</p>

<p>       If we notice, most of these rituals, people will run and dont walk<br />       slowly<br />       for 5 mins, singing song as they show in karagatakaran.</p>

<p>         Dear Natarajan, I didn't mean all forms of extreme devotion as<br />         'stunt'<br />         sorry for the misunderstanding, I only deem them unnecessary. Just<br />         fyi to<br />         you a huge number of thee midhis are used as stunts almost arranged<br />         like<br />         circus with an organiser and participant, soon after the<br />         participants are<br />         whisked away so that audience does not see any injuries on her foot.<br />         Usually<br />         these are very poor women doing it for a living.

<p>           Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be like an<br />         acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is relative. I can<br />         never dare<br />         to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt.</p>

<p>               Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />               unflinching faith<br />         and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of<br />         accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the<br />         appeal does<br />         not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on<br />         person's<br />         feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests<br />         may be<br />         anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as<br />         these.</p>
<p>               There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not<br />         possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                 On sharing the contents of this mail in some other group, I<br />         received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                 The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark<br />                 of<br />         unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked by<br />         the<br />         Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worship in<br />         Tamil<br />         nadu..</p>
<p>                 But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique"<br />                 practice<br />         separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism is<br />         highly<br />         flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style<br />         of<br />         viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not<br />         as whole<br />         and holistic..</p>
<p>                 In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is<br />                 indicative<br />         of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped<br />         durign this<br />         festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi amman,<br />         Kali<br />         amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman,<br />         Draupadi<br />         amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all<br />         these<br />         ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy<br />         and<br />         great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />         Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part<br />         of<br />         Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take<br />         literally<br />         thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her<br />         devotees in<br />         each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />         Mariamman is<br />         mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi<br />         Devi in<br />         these verses!</p>
<p>                 ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is<br />                 Shiva's<br />         emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in<br />         most of<br />         the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers<br />         shout<br />         "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the<br />         poster say<br />         that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktism<br />         and<br />         Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                 Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                 trasncends the<br />         ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so<br />         blatantly<br />         visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that calls<br />         for<br />         great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                 friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event<br />                 on the<br />         forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                 last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                 walking) in<br />         chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street<br />         corner<br />         temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />         temples in<br />         chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                 no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the<br />                 people<br />         than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers.<br />         only the<br />         remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                 the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam<br />                 oorvalam,<br />         karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />         halmark of<br />         these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />         mostly from<br />         the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among<br />         these<br />         people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                 a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of<br />                 the<br />         masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                 mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition<br />                 which has<br />         not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />         christian waves<br />         in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious<br />         movements<br />         have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />         community.</p>
<p>                 hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large<br />                 in<br />         tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />         ofcourse.<br />                 i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural<br />                 district<br />         pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn<br />         hills.</p>
<p>                 in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500<br />                 years<br />         of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

        <p>Every year people walk from my native Devakottai to Palani(175 km - 7 days walk) during Thaipusam. When I was in my college second year I walked this pathayathirai.<br />Very good experience, Practically even the strongest man cant have stamina to walk the distance without pain. I was first timer I couldnt walk at all.It was impossible. That one of the rare time I realised it it requires some thing more than self confidence to walk the distane. It surely needed thedrive, the ferocity and religious fervour. The songs sung by people while they walk esp there is one song 'Karupar Paatu' which just makes u violent.I have experienced it my self. I was done and out( I have flat foot a deformity which causes pain in the bones above the heels if you walk for long).Still some 3-4 miles were left in the days walk, it was around 10Pm in thenight. <br />I was about to fall two people caught me on their shoulders and I totally knew I couldn't walk even for a min. Two guys held me and one person with his powerful voice started singing the Karupar paatu(the song is supposed to be very powerful..when ever this song is sung some ladies get the frenzy while going on padyatra)..the song had some vibrations...I could nt open my eyes , I was still tired ..but my legs walked. After a while we reached the destination.<br />When we reached the destination all people said I got'Saami' and I was walking really fast like as if I was possessed. Only thing I knew was I wasnt possessed but at the same time- till date-I cant understand how I could walkso fast for one hour when I dint have even a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of energy to stand on my own legs(no water no glucose no gatorade)?<br />I nearly saw a miracle in the same trip. One of my relatives was strung by scorpion on the way. Sivaganga town was 1 hr away. He didnt want to get on a bus(since the veratham would end).. so with the scorpion bite he walked for 1 hr to Siva ganga and went to a clinic(actually they closed the clinic some how we found the doctor)...</acronym></p>
<p>These are things you dont experience in a day to day life. You see Thousands of people walking to Palani. My sister was carrying her 1 year old daughter and walking. Religion and God becomes really essential when you take up trip like that. Totally different experience for me. To be without TV internet phone and lie down where ever u feel like( I have had short sleeps on the muds in the side of Highways) and eat in places u will never dream of innormal days.</p>
<p>Its one place u realize there is some thing more than self confidence. Whenyou lose ur self confidence you solely depend on GOD to move further. I experienced it and till date it is a memorable trip in my life.</p>

<p>  ? <br />  The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a strategyfor people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places you cando it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your feet is what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has nothing to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs :))</p>

Just fyi to<br />          you a huge number of thee midhis are used as stunts almost arranged like<br />          circus with an organiser and participant, soon after the participants are<br />          whisked away so that audience does not see any injuries on her foot. Usually<br />          these are very poor women doing it for a living.

<p>                Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faith<br />          and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of<br />          accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the appeal does<br />          not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on person's<br />          feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be<br />          anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as these.</p>
<p>                There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not<br />          possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                  On sharing the contents of this mail in some other group,I<br />          received this reply from:http://jataayu. blogspot. com/</p>
<p>                  The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark of<br />          unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked by the<br />          Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worshipin Tamil<br />          nadu..</p>
<p>                  But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique"practice<br />          separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism is highly<br />          flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style of<br />          viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not as whole<br />          and holistic..</p>
<p>                  In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is indicative<br />          of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped durign this<br />          festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi amman, Kali<br />          amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman, Draupadi<br />          amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* allthese<br />          ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy and<br />          great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />          Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part of<br />          Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take literally<br />          thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her devotees in<br />          each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised. Mariamman is<br />          mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi Devi in<br />          these verses!</p>
<p>                  ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that isShiva's<br />          emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in most of<br />          the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers shout<br />          "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the poster say<br />          that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktism and<br />          Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                  Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that trasncends the<br />          ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is soblatantly<br />          visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that calls for<br />          great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                  friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the<br />          forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                  last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in<br />          chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner<br />          temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in<br />          chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                  no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people<br />          than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the<br />          remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                  the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudamoorvalam,<br />          karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of<br />          these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from<br />          the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these<br />          people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                  a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation ofthe<br />          masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                  mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has<br />          not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves<br />          in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements<br />          have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>                  hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large in<br />          tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />                  i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district<br />          pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>                  in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years<br />          of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>
