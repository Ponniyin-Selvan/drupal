<p>I guess I should put mu tuppence worth in. I agree that what Ramadoss and co <br />are doing is taking things to an extreme. However, I also feel that the <br />level of spoke Tamizh has deteriorated remarkably, especially among the <br />English educated folks. This needs to be corrected. I am so ashamed when I <br />hear a Bengali or someone from UP speak their respective languages, with <br />nary a word of English thrown in. But watch a couple of tamilians speak, and <br />it is rather appalling. Just for kicks, check out some programs on Sun TV <br />(let's say the news) and watch a couple of Tamilians give their views. And <br />for contrast watch a couple of Northern people speak Hindi and you can see <br />the stark difference. What amazes me is this. People feel ashamed to make <br />even simple grammatical errors while speaking English. But they appear to <br />have absolutely no problems making all sorts of errors while speaking <br />Tamizh. Why is this the case?</p>
<p><PLUG ALERT <br />As my own small effort towards correcting this tendency, I have started a <br />yahoo group called Tamizhvalarchchi where I send out a word-a-day (Dinamoru <br />Tamizhchchol). You can access it at <br /><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi</a>.<br /></plug>
</p><p>Yes, we ought not to take it to extremes, but we ought to be able to speak <br />our mothertongues well. </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>  Sampath,</p>
<p>  Personal attacks apart, I think you are trying to twist facts. No one<br />  is trying to ban other art forms. trying to promote Tamil music is not<br />  banning Carnatic music. If Tamils in Tamilnadu cannot promote Tamil<br />  music then who else would?.</p>
<p>  What's the necessity to name tamil movies in english words, and using<br />  english words in tamil songs. As i said earlier (maybe in<br />  "maraththadi") movies and music is the only link now between<br />  youngsters in TN with tamil. what's the need for naming a movie "New"<br />  and songs like "suppose unnai kaathalichu..."?? I don't think many<br />  people are into tamil novels / magazines..</p>
<p>  No one is against scientific development. We should all welcome it,<br />  but at the sametime make sure the language grows too.. "kanippori" is<br />  a new Tamil word coined and gained enough currency.</p>
<p>  No one is against sanskrit either. Last month I was in a temple in<br />  pittsburgh. The priest (i believe a non-tamil) was chanting "pallaandu<br />  pallaandu pallayirathaandu.. ". It was nice to hear that. don't know<br />  that priest knew the meaning, but i was able to comprehend.. If you<br />  communicate in a language you know you can immediately connect.. With<br />  thousands of religious songs in tamil, It would be a common-sense<br />  thing to use tamil in prayers.</p>
<p>  Even for a non-religious person like me, hearing devotional songs that<br />  I understand makes sense.. I believe you are passionate about<br />  religion. Common sense dictates that you should be in the forefront to<br />  lead this to cultivate interest in the people..</p>

<p>    narendran,</p>
<p>    what is the objective of this agitation?</p>
<p>    1.stop using sanskrit,english words<br />    2.name <http://2.name  yourself in tamil.</p>
<p>    English borrows many words from all over the<br />    world.They recently have added words like karma,deepawali and Ganesh<br />    to their dictionary.check it out in dictionary.com.Did any english<br />    man protest when these words were inlcuded?</p>
<p>    and asking firms to name themselves in tamil is<br />    utter foolishness.For example chettinad cement,its a tamilian<br />    company.If it names itself as "chettinadu kalavai tholichalai" no<br />    body outside tamilnadu will know what business it is in.</p>
<p>    also for many sanskrit words there arent equal tamil<br />    words.For example amaichar.mandhiri both are sanskrit words.There is<br />    no equilant word in tamil to it.Also daily thousands of inventions<br />    are patented all over the world.Translating all of them into tamil<br />    is impossible.</p>
<p>    This will destroy tamilians totally.Language is a<br />    tool for human improvement.But these people make out as if people<br />    are a tool to language improvement.</p>
<p>    also preerving tamil music and arts is a good<br />    joke.Music and arts have no linguistic barriers.Americans enjoy<br />    music all over the world-including african bancho music.good arts<br />    and music have to be enjoyed regardless of language.</p>
<p>    we can say karagattam is great,oyilattam is great<br />    etc.Fine,but western jazz and rap are better than that.whats wrong<br />    in enjoying it?saying i will revive tamil music is also humbug.our<br />    nattupura padals are ok,but there are better forms of music than<br />    that.Let people who want to hear them,hear them.Threatening singers<br />    and poets to use only tamil is cultural fascism.</p>
<p>    Let some great musician compose great tune in<br />    tamil.People all over the world will enjoy it without bothering<br />    which language its coming from.Change oyilattam,karagattam to some<br />    great artistic form and it will be liked all over the world.If<br />    anybody has that creativity and interest let them do so.But stopping<br />    other languages and saying listening to karnatic and english music<br />    is anti-tamil is meaningless to say the least.</p>
<p>    Tamil has to compete and grow.It cannot ban<br />    others and grow.If it happens tamilians will go back by thousands of<br />    years.</p>

<p>      Hello Prasanna,</p>
<p>      Karunanithi has never said his grandson knew Hindi and that's the<br />      reason for his cabinet post.. It's a rumor spread by vested<br />      interests.. I can change my opinion if you quote any newspaper<br />      clippings and dates when he said that..</p>
<p>      Coming to the point of the current agitation, i fully support<br />    that..<br />      English has crept into our normal usage so much, that it's almost<br />      impossible for anyone to speak a sentence without English in it..</p>
<p>      I appreciate the efforts of these folks to spread tamil words<br />      awareness and preserve tamil folk arts and music..</p>
<p>      The last thing we can do is to club this as fanaticism. Ramadoss<br />    has<br />      clarified that he is not against any language (let alone English).<br />      Infact his quote was to improve the level of English knowledge in<br />    the<br />      students and lamented that even graduates cannot write / speak a<br />      sentence in proper English..</p>

        <p>As an addendum.. someone mentioned Carnatic Music.. For me personally, I <br />tend to listen more to instrumental Carnatic rather than vocal (unless it is <br />Nithyashree Mahadevan). Then again, I realized that one of the reasons for <br />that might be that all the Thyagaraj Keertanais are in Telugu and I can't <br />really understand those. However, I also realized that I enjoyed Bharathiyar <br />compositions immensely, and then it dawned on me that maybe its the <br />language.. I like listening to what I understand. In a way, instrumental <br />music takes the language variable out of the equation.. but sometimes the <br />beauty of the words is lost. So yeah, hearing something in a language one <br />understands CAN make a difference.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  I guess I should put mu tuppence worth in. I agree that what Ramadoss and <br />  co are doing is taking things to an extreme. However, I also feel that the <br />  level of spoke Tamizh has deteriorated remarkably, especially among the <br />  English educated folks. This needs to be corrected. I am so ashamed when I <br />  hear a Bengali or someone from UP speak their respective languages, with <br />  nary a word of English thrown in. But watch a couple of tamilians speak, and <br />  it is rather appalling. Just for kicks, check out some programs on Sun TV <br />  (let's say the news) and watch a couple of Tamilians give their views. And <br />  for contrast watch a couple of Northern people speak Hindi and you can see <br />  the stark difference. What amazes me is this. People feel ashamed to make <br />  even simple grammatical errors while speaking English. But they appear to <br />  have absolutely no problems making all sorts of errors while speaking <br />  Tamizh. Why is this the case?</p>
<p>  <PLUG ALERT <br />  As my own small effort towards correcting this tendency, I have started a <br />  yahoo group called Tamizhvalarchchi where I send out a word-a-day (Dinamoru <br />  Tamizhchchol). You can access it at <br />  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamizhvalarchchi</a>.<br />  </plug>
</p><p>  Yes, we ought not to take it to extremes, but we ought to be able to speak <br />  our mothertongues well. </p>

<p>    Sampath,</p>
<p>    Personal attacks apart, I think you are trying to twist facts. No one<br />    is trying to ban other art forms. trying to promote Tamil music is not<br />    banning Carnatic music. If Tamils in Tamilnadu cannot promote Tamil <br />    music then who else would?.</p>
<p>    What's the necessity to name tamil movies in english words, and using<br />    english words in tamil songs. As i said earlier (maybe in<br />    "maraththadi") movies and music is the only link now between <br />    youngsters in TN with tamil. what's the need for naming a movie "New"<br />    and songs like "suppose unnai kaathalichu..."?? I don't think many<br />    people are into tamil novels / magazines..</p>
<p>    No one is against scientific development. We should all welcome it, <br />    but at the sametime make sure the language grows too.. "kanippori" is<br />    a new Tamil word coined and gained enough currency.</p>
<p>    No one is against sanskrit either. Last month I was in a temple in<br />    pittsburgh. The priest (i believe a non-tamil) was chanting "pallaandu <br />    pallaandu pallayirathaandu.. ". It was nice to hear that. don't know<br />    that priest knew the meaning, but i was able to comprehend.. If you<br />    communicate in a language you know you can immediately connect.. With <br />    thousands of religious songs in tamil, It would be a common-sense<br />    thing to use tamil in prayers.</p>
<p>    Even for a non-religious person like me, hearing devotional songs that<br />    I understand makes sense.. I believe you are passionate about <br />    religion. Common sense dictates that you should be in the forefront to<br />    lead this to cultivate interest in the people..</p>

<p>      English borrows many words from all over the<br />      world.They recently have added words like karma,deepawali and Ganesh<br />      to their dictionary.check it out in dictionary.com.Did any english<br />      man protest when these words were inlcuded? </p>
<p>      and asking firms to name themselves in tamil is<br />      utter foolishness.For example chettinad cement,its a tamilian<br />      company.If it names itself as "chettinadu kalavai tholichalai" no<br />      body outside tamilnadu will know what business it is in. </p>
<p>      also for many sanskrit words there arent equal tamil<br />      words.For example amaichar.mandhiri both are sanskrit words.There is<br />      no equilant word in tamil to it.Also daily thousands of inventions<br />      are patented all over the world.Translating all of them into tamil<br />      is impossible.</p>
<p>      This will destroy tamilians totally.Language is a<br />      tool for human improvement.But these people make out as if people<br />      are a tool to language improvement.</p>
<p>      also preerving tamil music and arts is a good<br />      joke.Music and arts have no linguistic barriers.Americans enjoy<br />      music all over the world-including african bancho music.good arts<br />      and music have to be enjoyed regardless of language. </p>
<p>      we can say karagattam is great,oyilattam is great<br />      etc.Fine,but western jazz and rap are better than that.whats wrong<br />      in enjoying it?saying i will revive tamil music is also humbug.our<br />      nattupura padals are ok,but there are better forms of music than <br />      that.Let people who want to hear them,hear them.Threatening singers<br />      and poets to use only tamil is cultural fascism.</p>
<p>      Let some great musician compose great tune in<br />      tamil.People all over the world will enjoy it without bothering<br />      which language its coming from.Change oyilattam,karagattam to some<br />      great artistic form and it will be liked all over the world.If<br />      anybody has that creativity and interest let them do so.But stopping<br />      other languages and saying listening to karnatic and english music<br />      is anti-tamil is meaningless to say the least.</p>
<p>      Tamil has to compete and grow.It cannot ban<br />      others and grow.If it happens tamilians will go back by thousands of<br />      years.</p>
<p>      regards<br />      sampath</p>

<p>        Hello Prasanna,</p>
<p>        Karunanithi has never said his grandson knew Hindi and that's the <br />        reason for his cabinet post.. It's a rumor spread by vested<br />        interests.. I can change my opinion if you quote any newspaper<br />        clippings and dates when he said that..</p>
<p>        Coming to the point of the current agitation, i fully support <br />      that..<br />        English has crept into our normal usage so much, that it's almost<br />        impossible for anyone to speak a sentence without English in it..</p>
<p>        I appreciate the efforts of these folks to spread tamil words <br />        awareness and preserve tamil folk arts and music..</p>
<p>        The last thing we can do is to club this as fanaticism. Ramadoss<br />      has<br />        clarified that he is not against any language (let alone English). <br />        Infact his quote was to improve the level of English knowledge in<br />      the<br />        students and lamented that even graduates cannot write / speak a<br />        sentence in proper English..</p>
<p>        Thanks,<br />        Naren.</p>
