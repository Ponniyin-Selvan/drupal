        <p>hi</p>
<p>The ramnad kings claim an antiquity that no one else can rival. that <br />they were appointed keepers of the bridge by lord rama himself.</p>
<p>but though there have been a fairly independent maravar kingdom in <br />that area the ramnad kingdom was most propably developed by the naiks <br />of madurai.<br />this was mainly to discipline that area which was known for banditry <br />and it was an important route for pilgrims to rameshwaram.</p>
<p>In 1520 AD., the Nayaks of Vijayangar took over this area under their <br />control and for about two centuries, Marava chieftains-Sethupathis who <br />were petty kings under them.</p>

<p>    Hi all</p>
<p>    The Sethupaathy Royalty of Ramanathapuram is<br />    known for their bravery and loyalty since Ramayana<br />    Times. The Sethu Seemai consisting of majority of<br />    Tamil Maravas are Very Gallant warriers. In Chola<br />    times, They constituted the Army to arrest any<br />    intrusion of singalese into main Land and the<br />    security of Coastal belt extending from Rameswaram<br />    to Point calimere ( Kodiakarai).</p>
<p>    Original Sethupathy Paintings can been seen still<br />    lively in the existing Palace of Ramavilasam in the<br />    Ramanathapuram city. In 18th Century, Sethupathy<br />    Kings fought against the British and One Sethu King<br />    was imprisoned for life in the present day Fort<br />    Saint George till his Death. His queens commited<br />    sati in the fires set by rhe British coolies around<br />    Ramanathapuram Palace.</p>

<p>      Madurai Nayak dynasty went? Has this already been<br />    discussed or is <br />    the answer<br />      too simple?</p>
<p>    hi rahul</p>
<p>    the madurai nayaks had a very sorry demise.<br />    from the proud anti muslim kings that they were they<br />    stooped to <br />    joining hands with the mughals to punish their hindu<br />    neighbours like <br />    travancore, ramnad, tanjore etc</p>
<p>    rani mangammal was the last but one ruler and when<br />    she refused to make <br />    way for her grandson she was supposedly locked up in<br />    a prison and <br />    forgotten. she is said to have starved to death.</p>
<p>    the last ruler was once again a woman- meenakshi who<br />    allied with <br />    chanda sahib and fought everybody around.</p>
<p>    theres a great story about it. meenakshi made chanda<br />    sahib take a vow <br />    on the koran book that he would remain faithful to<br />    her. actually <br />    chanda bound a brick in a green cloth and took a vow<br />    on it. several <br />    years later he proved treachorous and madurai passed<br />    onto the arcot <br />    family which inturn had to turn it over to the<br />    british in lieu o a <br />    loan</p>
<p>    so thats what happened to the naiks.</p>

<p>Such Temples are THIRUVADANAI, Rameswaram, Nayyanar Kovil, <br />Thirupuvanam almost all sung by Saint Thirugnana Sampandar Peruman.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  in that geographical area ,sivaganga samsthanam has a lot of temples <br />to manage right now.kalayar koil, kundrakudi, kandadevi etc.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The Contributions of Sethu Kings of Ramanathapuram to the Development of Tamil is a note worthy. The Vallal Pandithurai Thevar established the present day Madurai Tamil Sangam with an enormous donations. The American Visit of Swami Vivakananda for his Hindu Relegious Meet was obcourse sponsored by this Dynasty. Many of the Pandyan Country Siva Temples (Fourteen Temples, Of which most of the Siva lingas are Swyampus ) are controlled and administered by Rani Sri Sri Rajeshwari Natchiyar<br />Such Temples are THIRUVADANAI, Rameswaram, Nayyanar Kovil, Thirupuvanam almost all sung by Saint Thirugnana Sampandar Peruman.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi all</p>
<p>  The Sethupaathy Royalty of Ramanathapuram is<br />  known for their bravery and loyalty since Ramayana<br />  Times. The Sethu Seemai consisting of majority of<br />  Tamil Maravas are Very Gallant warriers. In Chola<br />  times, They constituted the Army to arrest any<br />  intrusion of singalese into main Land and the<br />  security of Coastal belt extending from Rameswaram<br />  to Point calimere ( Kodiakarai).</p>
<p>  Original Sethupathy Paintings can been seen still<br />  lively in the existing Palace of Ramavilasam in the<br />  Ramanathapuram city. In 18th Century, Sethupathy<br />  Kings fought against the British and One Sethu King<br />  was imprisoned for life in the present day Fort<br />  Saint George till his Death. His queens commited<br />  sati in the fires set by rhe British coolies around<br />  Ramanathapuram Palace.</p>

<p>    Madurai Nayak dynasty went? Has this already been<br />  discussed or is <br />  the answer<br />    too simple?</p>
<p>  hi rahul</p>
<p>  the madurai nayaks had a very sorry demise.<br />  from the proud anti muslim kings that they were they<br />  stooped to <br />  joining hands with the mughals to punish their hindu<br />  neighbours like <br />  travancore, ramnad, tanjore etc</p>
<p>  rani mangammal was the last but one ruler and when<br />  she refused to make <br />  way for her grandson she was supposedly locked up in<br />  a prison and <br />  forgotten. she is said to have starved to death.</p>
<p>  the last ruler was once again a woman- meenakshi who<br />  allied with <br />  chanda sahib and fought everybody around.</p>
<p>  theres a great story about it. meenakshi made chanda<br />  sahib take a vow <br />  on the koran book that he would remain faithful to<br />  her. actually <br />  chanda bound a brick in a green cloth and took a vow<br />  on it. several <br />  years later he proved treachorous and madurai passed<br />  onto the arcot <br />  family which inturn had to turn it over to the<br />  british in lieu o a <br />  loan</p>
<p>  so thats what happened to the naiks.</p>

<p>for bhaskara himself was in great debts. the management of his zamin <br />had been transferred to another non- maravar gentleman for a short <br />period because the british suspected his abilities. bhaska reportedly <br />died a broken man at age of 32.</p>

        <p>Hi all</p>
<p>The Sethupaathy Royalty of Ramanathapuram is known for their bravery and loyalty since Ramayana Times. The Sethu Seemai consisting of majority of Tamil Maravas are Very Gallant warriers. In Chola times, They constituted the Army to arrest any intrusion of singalese into main Land and the security of Coastal belt extending from Rameswaram to Point calimere ( Kodiakarai).</p>
<p>Original Sethupathy Paintings can been seen still lively in the existing Palace of Ramavilasam in the Ramanathapuram city. In 18th Century, Sethupathy Kings fought against the British and One Sethu King was imprisoned for life in the present day Fort Saint George till his Death. His queens commited sati in the fires set by rhe British coolies around Ramanathapuram Palace.</p>

<p>Ive read about and seen photographs about this Shroud of Turin. I think there was a controversy on the authenticity of this Shroud. Its pretty well preserved too for such an old relic.</p>
<p>Every morning in Jaya TV news they have a segment called "Kala Chuvadugal". this programs shows a number of temples, palace buildings in ruins. It really feels sad we are unable to preserve our incredible history and heritage. </p>

<p>Ive read about and seen photographs about this Shroud of Turin. I think<br />there was a controversy on the authenticity of this Shroud. Its pretty well<br />preserved too for such an old relic.</p>
<p>Every morning in Jaya TV news they have a segment called "Kala Chuvadugal".<br />this programs shows a number of temples, palace buildings in ruins. It<br />really feels sad we are unable to preserve our incredible history and<br />heritage.</p>

        <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>That was interesting article. It has been mentioned in the article Rajendra was the son of Lokhamadevi. Does this mean that Vanthi was fictional character in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , as Kalki hints Rajendra was the son of Vanathi. </p>
<p>Whew, that was quite lot of information in a single week.</p>

<p>I remember you talking about this tapestry during our meeting in Chennai. It looks really beautiful. Infact it is hard to believe that it is 6 centuries old. The colors are still so brilliant even though these should have been painted using vegetable dyes (please correct if wrong) rather than oils and other chemicals we use today. Even the edges of the tapestry have not been frayed, brilliant!!! </p>
<p>And thanks for clearing the matter about the Pandyas wiping out the Cholas before Malik's arrival. I felt you were best equipped to do this.</p>

<p>dear rahul</p>
<p>its not the materiel that you write on that matters.<br />have you heard of the battle of hastings in england. took place in <br />1066( contemprory of rajendra or his successor)</p>
<p>the entire story of that battle is embroided onto a tapestry. it is <br />still preserved<br />The Bayeux Tapestry (French: Tapisserie de Bayeux) is a 50 cm by 70 m <br />(20 inches by 230 ft) long embroidered cloth which depicts scenes <br />commemorating the Battle of Hastings in 1066, with annotations in <br />Latin.

        <p>Hi Mr.Venketesh</p>
<p>I remember you talking about this tapestry during our meeting in Chennai. It<br />looks really beautiful. Infact it is hard to believe that it is 6 centuries<br />old. The colors are still so brilliant even though these should have been<br />painted using vegetable dyes (please correct if wrong) rather than oils and<br />other chemicals we use today. Even the edges of the tapestry have not been<br />frayed, brilliant!!!</p>
<p>And thanks for clearing the matter about the Pandyas wiping out the Cholas<br />before Malik's arrival. I felt you were best equipped to do this.</p>

<p>  the cholas were non existent by the time nalik came</p>
<p>  infact one pandya capital was at cannanore( samayapuram)</p>
<p>  the wiping out of the cholas ( to the great satisfaction of the<br />  pandya) were infact their undoing. malik conquered tamil territory at<br />  the speed of his cavalry.</p>
<p>    Portions of the state annexed to Delhi, while other areas fall into<br />  the<br />    hands of provincial rule  </p>
<p>  the town of madurai was conquered in the second turk conquest 10 years<br />  after malik. it was then that they put up a governor. the governor<br />  established a independent sultanate when dynasties changed in delhi.</p>
<p>  maliks army never met the cholas and its a serious doubt that he<br />  crossed tanjore. chidambaram, sirkali and srirangam were the major<br />  temples he looted on the way to madurai. could have crossed<br />  thirukandiyur.</p>
<p>    Stone is supposed to be the hardiest of elements, its able to<br />  withstand<br />    rain,storm, heat, everything except mankind. Just imagine if<br />  everythin were<br />    to be written in paper or cloth instead of stone carvings. Nothing<br />  would<br />    have remained and the British would have convinced us that we were<br />  cavemen<br />    before they came.</p>
<p>  dear rahul</p>
<p>  its not the materiel that you write on that matters.<br />  have you heard of the battle of hastings in england. took place in<br />  1066( contemprory of rajendra or his successor)</p>
<p>  the entire story of that battle is embroided onto a tapestry. it is<br />  still preserved<br />  The Bayeux Tapestry (French: Tapisserie de Bayeux) is a 50 cm by 70 m<br />  (20 inches by 230 ft) long embroidered cloth which depicts scenes<br />  commemorating the Battle of Hastings in 1066, with annotations in<br />  Latin. It is presently exhibited in a special museum in Bayeux,<br />  Normandy, France.</p>
<p>  it was made in 1077 probably. our members in Europe may have a chance<br />  to see it.</p>

<p>the cholas were non existent by the time nalik came</p>
<p>infact one pandya capital was at cannanore( samayapuram)</p>
<p>the wiping out of the cholas ( to the great satisfaction of the <br />pandya) were infact their undoing. malik conquered tamil territory at <br />the speed of his cavalry.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Portions of the state annexed to Delhi, while other areas fall into <br />the<br />  hands of provincial rule  </p></blockquote>
<p>the town of madurai was conquered in the second turk conquest 10 years <br />after malik. it was then that they put up a governor. the governor <br />established a independent sultanate when dynasties changed in delhi.</p>
<p>maliks army never met the cholas and its a serious doubt that he <br />crossed tanjore. chidambaram, sirkali and srirangam were the major <br />temples he looted on the way to madurai. could have crossed <br />thirukandiyur.</p>

Nothing <br />would<br />  have remained and the British would have convinced us that we were <br />cavemen<br />  before they came.</p>

<p>dear rahul</p>
<p>its not the materiel that you write on that matters.<br />have you heard of the battle of hastings in england. took place in <br />1066( contemprory of rajendra or his successor)</p>
<p>the entire story of that battle is embroided onto a tapestry. it is <br />still preserved<br />The Bayeux Tapestry (French: Tapisserie de Bayeux) is a 50 cm by 70 m <br />(20 inches by 230 ft) long embroidered cloth which depicts scenes <br />commemorating the Battle of Hastings in 1066, with annotations in <br />Latin. It is presently exhibited in a special museum in Bayeux, <br />Normandy, France.</p>
<p>it was made in 1077 probably. our members in Europe may have a chance <br />to see it.</p>

        <p>&lt;<Chola disrupted by defeat at the hands of the Delhi Sultanate in 1279.<br />Portions of the state annexed to Delhi, while other areas fall into the<br />hands of provincial rule  </chola></p>
<p>I though during 1279 Pandyas werre well into thier 2nd or 3rd generation of<br />rule after they comprehensively defeated the Cholas and wiped out thier<br />remnants. Also i thought the Delhi sultanate defeated the Hoysalas and thier<br />next battle was with the Pandyas (if u can call that a battle, the Pandays<br />ran away and left my poor Madurai to Malik).<br />I think Mr.Venkatesh can correct or clarify this. These subjects have been<br />discussed so many times by us and probably by a lot of scholars. The lack of<br />documentation or lack in preservation of documentation is just ridiculous.<br />Stone is supposed to be the hardiest of elements, its able to withstand<br />rain,storm, heat, everything except mankind. Just imagine if everythin were<br />to be written in paper or cloth instead of stone carvings. Nothing would<br />have remained and the British would have convinced us that we were cavemen<br />before they came.</p>
