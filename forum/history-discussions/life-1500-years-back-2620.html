<p>I came across this piece as a forward. Dont know how far its true. <br />Can anyone confirm this?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>
<p>-----------------------<br />The next time you are washing your hands and complain because the <br />water temperature isn't just how you like it, think about how things <br />used to be. Here are some facts about 500 years ago. These are <br />interesting...</p>
<p>Most people got married in June because they took their yearly bath <br />in May, and still smelled pretty good by June. However, they were <br />starting to smell, so brides carried a bouquet of flowers to hide <br />the body odour. Hence the custom today of brides carrying a bouquet <br />when getting married.</p>
<p>Baths consisted of a big tub filled with hot water. The man of the <br />house had the privilege of the nice clean water, then all the other <br />sons and men, then the women and finally the children. Last of all <br />the babies. By then the water was so dirty you could actually lose <br />someone in it. Hence the saying, Don't throw the baby out with the <br />Bath water..</p>
<p>Houses had thatched roofs-thick straw-piled high, with no wood <br />underneath. It was the only place for animals to get warm, so all <br />the cats and other small animals (mice, bugs) lived in the roof. <br />When it rained it became slippery and sometimes the animals would <br />slip and fall off the roof. Hence the saying: It's raining cats and <br />dogs.</p>
<p>There was nothing to stop things from falling into the house. This <br />posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings <br />could mess up your nice clean bed. Hence, a bed with big posts and a <br />sheet hung over the top afforded some protection. That's how canopy <br />beds came into existence.</p>
<p>The floor was dirt. Only the wealthy had something other than dirt. <br />Hence the saying, Dirt poor. The wealthy had slate floors That would <br />get slippery in the winter when wet , so they spread thresh (straw) <br />on floor to help keep their footing. As the winter wore on, they <br />added more thresh until, when you opened the door, it would all <br />start slipping outside. A piece of wood was placed in the <br />entranceway. Hence the word ... thresh hold..</p>
<p>In those old days, they cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle that <br />always hung over the fire. Every day they lit the fire and added <br />things to the pot. They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much <br />meat. They would eat the stew for dinner, leaving leftovers in the <br />pot to get cold overnight and then start over the next day. <br />Sometimes stew had food in it that had been there for quite a while. <br />Hence the rhyme, Peas porridge hot, peas porridge cold, peas <br />porridge in the pot nine days old..</p>
<p>Sometimes they could obtain pork, which made them feel quite <br />special. When visitors came over, they would hang up their bacon to <br />show off. It was a sign of wealth that a man could bring home the <br />bacon.. They would cut off a little to share with guests and would <br />all sit around and chew the fat..</p>
<p>Those with money had plates made of pewter. Food with high acid <br />content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food, causing lead <br />poisoning death. This happened most often with tomatoes, so for the <br />next 400 years or so, tomatoes were considered poisonous (now you <br />didnt know that. Did you).</p>
<p>Bread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt bottom <br />of the loaf, the guests got the middle, and the family got the top. <br />Hence the Upper crust.</p>
<p>Lead cups were used to drink ale or whisky. The combination would <br />sometimes knock the imbibers out for a couple of days. Someone <br />walking along the road would take them for dead and prepare them for <br />burial. They were laid out on the kitchen table for a couple of days <br />and the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait and <br />see if they would wake up. Hence<br />the custom of holding a Wake.</p>
<p>England is old and small and the local folks started running out of <br />places to bury people. So they<br />would dig up coffins and would take the bones to a bone-house, and <br />reuse the grave. When reopening these coffins, 1 out of 25 coffins <br />were found to have scratch marks on the inside and they realized <br />they had been burying people alive. So they would tie a string on <br />the wrist of the corpse, lead it through the coffin and up through <br />the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone would have to sit out in <br />the graveyard all night (Graveyard Shift) to listen for the bell; <br />thus, someone could be, saved by the bell or was considered <br />a ...dead ringer..</p>
<p>And that's the truth...Now , whoever said History was boring ! ! !<br />Educate someone. Share these facts with a friend.</p>

By then the water was so dirty you could actually lose <br />someone in it. Hence the saying, Don't throw the baby out with the <br />Bath water..</p>
<p>Houses had thatched roofs-thick straw-piled high, with no wood <br />underneath. It was the only place for animals to get warm, so all <br />the cats and other small animals (mice, bugs) lived in the roof. <br />When it rained it became slippery and sometimes the animals would <br />slip and fall off the roof. Hence the saying: It's raining cats and <br />dogs.</p>
<p>There was nothing to stop things from falling into the house. This <br />posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings <br />could mess up your nice clean bed. Hence, a bed with big posts and a <br />sheet hung over the top afforded some protection. That's how canopy <br />beds came into existence.</p>
<p>The floor was dirt. Only the wealthy had something other than dirt. <br />Hence the saying, Dirt poor. The wealthy had slate floors That would <br />get slippery in the winter when wet , so they spread thresh (straw) <br />on floor to help keep their footing. As the winter wore on, they <br />added more thresh until, when you opened the door, it would all <br />start slipping outside. A piece of wood was placed in the <br />entranceway. Hence the word ... thresh hold..</p>
<p>In those old days, they cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle that <br />always hung over the fire. Every day they lit the fire and added <br />things to the pot. They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much <br />meat. They would eat the stew for dinner, leaving leftovers in the <br />pot to get cold overnight and then start over the next day. <br />Sometimes stew had food in it that had been there for quite a while. <br />Hence the rhyme, Peas porridge hot, peas porridge cold, peas <br />porridge in the pot nine days old..</p>
<p>Sometimes they could obtain pork, which made them feel quite <br />special. When visitors came over, they would hang up their bacon to <br />show off. It was a sign of wealth that a man could bring home the <br />bacon.. They would cut off a little to share with guests and would <br />all sit around and chew the fat..</p>
<p>Those with money had plates made of pewter. Food with high acid <br />content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food, causing lead <br />poisoning death. This happened most often with tomatoes, so for the <br />next 400 years or so, tomatoes were considered poisonous (now you <br />didnt know that. Did you).</p>
<p>Bread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt bottom <br />of the loaf, the guests got the middle, and the family got the top. <br />Hence the Upper crust.</p>
<p>Lead cups were used to drink ale or whisky. The combination would <br />sometimes knock the imbibers out for a couple of days. Someone <br />walking along the road would take them for dead and prepare them for <br />burial. They were laid out on the kitchen table for a couple of days <br />and the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait and <br />see if they would wake up. Hence<br />the custom of holding a Wake.</p>
<p>England is old and small and the local folks started running out of <br />places to bury people. So they<br />would dig up coffins and would take the bones to a bone-house, and <br />reuse the grave. When reopening these coffins, 1 out of 25 coffins <br />were found to have scratch marks on the inside and they realized <br />they had been burying people alive. So they would tie a string on <br />the wrist of the corpse, lead it through the coffin and up through <br />the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone would have to sit out in <br />the graveyard all night (Graveyard Shift) to listen for the bell; <br />thus, someone could be, saved by the bell or was considered <br />a ...dead ringer..</p>
<p>And that's the truth...Now , whoever said History was boring ! ! !<br />Educate someone. Share these facts with a friend.</p>
