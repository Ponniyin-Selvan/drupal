<p>His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to mark victory <br />of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by villagers</p>
<p>of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring out a <br />procession carrying his idol. </p>
<p>"Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of Dravidian Gaud <br />tribe and we consider him as our ancestor. We hold a fair on this day <br />so that the next generation would remember his sacrifice and continue <br />the tradition," said Dhanirao Boddh, Indian Dalit Panther's President <br />and one of the organisers of the annual festival on Dussehra. </p>
<p>In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning effigies which, <br />it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>"Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either from <br />Pollution Control Board or from the administration," said another <br />member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>"Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn Ravana's <br />effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an immediate ban on <br />the practice. </p>
<p>Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring out a <br />procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, Gautam Budh, <br />Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be organised where <br />Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Most of the people who have read Kambaramayana or have heard the <br />story<br />  of Ramayana in Tamil tend to believe that Ravana was a true Dravidan<br />  King. That being the case after Dravidian movement many people felt,<br />  Ravana was wronged and killed by Rama an Aryan King. So how true is<br />  the Aryan- Dravidian conflict in Ramayana ? Why did Kamban introduce<br />  such conflict of cultures in his work? This essay is intended to <br />probe<br />  through the two questions and try to present the answer.</p>

          village which worships ravana....        </div>

        <p>It is fascinating to know that Indrajit was Lakshmana's son-in-law... Is itreally in Kamba Ramayanam or Valmiki Ramyanam..?<br />?<br />If Lakshmana was totally with Rama for the whole 14years in the forest... then how come Sulochona getting born and also getting married to Rama-Lakshmana's enemies son...? Pieces of puzzle are really a puzzling one here!<br />?<br />Any light on this is helpful...<br />?<br />Rgds.,<br />?<br />Shiv</p>

<p>Venkat, am leaving tomorrow, Chicago/London/ Bangalore monday morning. <br />Next week this time (friday) i will be in chennai, just one day trip <br />otherwise would have very much liked to meet with <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group. My cousin <br />has promised kapali temple so I will pick up your books at Giri if I <br />can. </acronym></p>
<p>Sulochana is Indrajit's wife, she is a Naga kanya or daughter of <br />Adisesha/Lakshmana. Lakshmana is actually Ravana's son's father in <br />law! It is fascinating to hear of temples built by Mandodhari, really <br />I had no idea about that! Is there any more information on her?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Malathi</p>
<p>  landed in india yet?</p>
<p>  by the way do you know who the mythological charecter sulochana is?<br />  she happens to be the wife of indrajit.<br />  there seem to be so many stories in our epics about her.<br />  i think the first kannada film ever was on her. quite a few tamil <br />  movies too.</p>
<p>  ravana and family seem to have their own set of stories too.<br />  i remember a discussion in our group on how the uthirakosamangai <br />  temple was first built by mandothari.</p>
<p>  sita initiated rameshwaram and mandothari is connected with a <br />  neighbouring temple.</p>

<p>    I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more than <br />    10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt <br />them, <br />  in <br />    TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />    makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />    boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />faith. <br />  In <br />    fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an eye' <br />    approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />    other side. </p>
<p>    Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it <br />with <br />    knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know <br />how <br />  to <br />    do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la Ramana <br />    Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did he <br />    profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>    I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love <br />to <br />    aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />    recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on <br />Amazon).</p>

<p>      Vairam,</p>
<p>      Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />  based <br />    teaching system. He too had faultered here and there. But <br />remember, <br />    but for Rajaji and UVS Iyer, the temple entry for all the <br />    oppressed would  not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />    happened now. But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />them.</p>
<p>      And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />  the <br />    social cause. I only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />    within the faith. As all of us know, his parents and ancestors <br />were <br />    all ardent believers of God. So being born into a family of <br />ardent <br />    believers, it is just his inability (yes, I would term it as <br />his <br />    inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />    believer. There can be thousands of reasons given, to explain, <br />why <br />    he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />  did not <br />    have either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />to <br />    fight from within.</p>
<p>      I am even fine with the fact that he became an atheist. But <br />my <br />    upfront question was why to garland the idols with chappals, <br />just <br />    to exhibit his atheistic inclinations.  And is this act, not <br />similar <br />    to what a Bajrang Dal is doing to the churches today. When a <br />    Bajrang Dal does this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />is <br />    Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>      This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />    Sunnambu". (Please  do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />    towards you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />    decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>      Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />    league of those who fought for social upliftment while <br />remaining <br />    within the fight. And remember, to come out of the faith and <br />fight <br />    against it is a very easy, but think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />    Sankarar or Ramanuja would have had to face while fighting for <br />the <br />    cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />    particular. Needless to say that this extends to everyone <br />    who fought or, is fighting for the cause of social equality <br />while <br />    remaining within the faith. </p>
<p>      Why did not the works of Azhwars or Nayanmars,  impress EVR. <br />    Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />    discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in which they <br />  mixed <br />    no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />    the extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate <br />in <br />    the name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />    this, while others can given ample references from <br />    the Nayanmars  too. </p>
<p>      Simply put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />knowledge nor <br />    the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars or an <br />Adhi Sankarar <br />    or Ramanuja to take on the society while remaining with in the <br />  faith.<br />       <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh</p>

<p>      Venkatesh,<br />      Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />very <br />      very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He <br />  also <br />      didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in <br />    school <br />      for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader <br />  has <br />      +ves and -ves.<br />      So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be <br />included <br />    is <br />      not a right argument here.<br />      Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />    society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were <br />    different but <br />      still the motive should be appreciated.<br />      I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and who <br />    shouldn't <br />      be.</p>

<p>        Nanda, </p>
<p>        IÂ am surprised that you sayÂ EVR chose to fight, instead <br />of <br />      gettingÂ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />      religion, but he could not stay withinÂ the faith and fight. <br />He <br />    did <br />      become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />  other <br />      hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />  Iyer, <br />    all <br />      wereÂ "practising"Â  Hindus, who very muchÂ believed in <br />God <br />    and fought <br />      with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>        In fact, whileÂ some of EVR's argument <br />wereÂ veryÂ valid <br />    regarding <br />      the irrationalÂ and illogicalÂ methods being followed, <br />    IÂ think that <br />      he did not understand the true scripturesÂ or tenets of <br />Hinduism, <br />      before deciding to take onÂ it. On the other hand, all those <br />four <br />      above andÂ thoseÂ unsung heroes, understoodÂ theÂ  <br />    scriptures than EVR <br />      and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />    withinÂ the <br />      faith. </p>
<p>        So IMHO, the only credit that we canÂ give to EVR is that, <br />he <br />    did <br />      not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />  one <br />      should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel <br />  with <br />      true rationalism.</p>
<p>        And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />  well, <br />      then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />    Pillayar <br />      withÂ chappals?Â  If EVR's grudge was against the <br />    discriminating <br />      Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />  Brahmins <br />    are <br />      notÂ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process <br />toÂ taking <br />    on <br />      theÂ discriminating Brahmins, heÂ and other fellow atheists <br />    have taken <br />      upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />    cannot <br />      sustain the take. </p>
<p>        So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those <br />who <br />      fought for theÂ social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />    faith.<br />        Â <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>

<p>        Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />    various <br />      other forums. Those who do not have the courage to <br />fightÂ within, <br />    are <br />      those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the <br />    original <br />      one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. NeedlessÂ to <br />say <br />    that <br />      our Politicians today are the standing examples of this <br />Spineless <br />      Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too. </p>
<p>        And do we haveÂ anyone who fought the bias from within the <br />    faith <br />      itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting fromÂ AdhiÂ Sankarar to <br />    Ramanuja to, <br />      until recentlyÂ Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et <br />all.Â There <br />    are also <br />      many lesser known persons, whoÂ have fought a lot from within <br />and <br />    I <br />      bet noneÂ of you will know even such persons existed. These <br />are <br />    the <br />      commonÂ human beings we see day toÂ day, who are silent <br />      revolutionaries.<br />        Â <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />        congratulations !! </p>
<p>        My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern <br />    stance <br />      on <br />        making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie <br />    Ravana <br />        is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on <br />  authentic <br />        understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it <br />Ravana <br />  or <br />        Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />        achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is <br />to <br />    the <br />        credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style <br />    evil <br />        but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />    liberation <br />        through surrender.</p>
<p>        What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know <br />    about <br />        Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice <br />in <br />    their <br />        own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps would <br />be <br />    to <br />        fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

<p>          His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to <br />mark <br />        victory <br />          of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by <br />      villagers</p>
<p>          of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring <br />  out <br />    a <br />          procession carrying his idol. </p>
<p>          "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of <br />Dravidian <br />    Gaud <br />          tribe and we consider him as our ancestor.

<p>          In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning <br />  effigies <br />        which, <br />          it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>          "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either <br />  from <br />          Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />    another <br />          member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>          "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />      Ravana's <br />          effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an <br />  immediate <br />      ban <br />        on <br />          the practice. </p>
<p>          Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring <br />  out <br />    a <br />          procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, <br />  Gautam <br />        Budh, <br />          Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>          Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be <br />organised <br />      where <br />          Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

<p>          Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that<br />    both<br />          EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right<br />  to<br />          freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.</p>
<p>          I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more<br />  than<br />          10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt<br />      them,<br />        in<br />          TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly.<br />  It<br />          makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without'<br />          boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any<br />      faith.<br />        In<br />          fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an<br />    eye'<br />          approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on<br />  the<br />          other side.</p>
<p>          Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise<br />  it<br />      with<br />          knowledge and responsibility is not something most people<br />  know<br />      how<br />        to<br />          do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la<br />  Ramana<br />          Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor<br />  did<br />    he<br />          profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>          I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time,<br />  love<br />      to<br />          aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!!<br />  Also<br />          recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on<br />      Amazon).</p>

<p>            Vairam,</p>
<p>            Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the<br />  vocational<br />        based<br />          teaching system.Ã‚ He too had faultered here and<br />there. But<br />      remember,<br />          but for RajajiÃ‚ and UVSÃ‚ Iyer, the temple<br />entry forÃ‚ all<br />  the<br />          oppressedÃ‚ wouldÃ‚ not have happened then.<br />Fine that it<br />  could<br />    have<br />          happened now.Ã‚ But I am talking about the<br />initiatives taken<br />  by<br />      them.</p>
<p>            And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight<br />  for<br />      the<br />          social cause. IÃ‚ only say that he could not do it<br />while<br />    remaining<br />          within the faith. AsÃ‚ all of us know, his<br />parentsÃ‚ and<br />  ancestors<br />        were<br />          all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃ‚<br />family of<br />      ardent<br />          believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚ (yes, I would<br />termÃ‚ it<br />  as<br />      his<br />          inability) to fight for the social cause while still<br />  remaining a<br />          believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚ reasons given,<br />toÃ‚<br />  explain,<br />      why<br />          he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he<br />        didÃ‚ not<br />          haveÃ‚ either the knowledge of the true scriptures or<br />the<br />  courage<br />      to<br />          fight from within.</p>
<p>            I amÃ‚ even fine with the fact that heÃ‚<br />became an atheist.<br />  But<br />      my<br />          upfront question was why toÃ‚ garland the idols with<br />  chappals,<br />      just<br />          toÃ‚ exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Ã‚ <br />And is this act,<br />  not<br />        similar<br />          to whatÃ‚ a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃ‚ the<br />churches today.<br />  When a<br />          Bajrang Dal doesÃ‚ this, it is "communal", but if EVR<br />does<br />  it, it<br />      is<br />          Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>            This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula<br />          Sunnambu".Ã‚ (PleaseÃ‚ do not mistake me. I<br />am not directing<br />  this<br />          towardsÃ‚ you, but the same government and the media<br />houses<br />  that<br />    I<br />          decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>            Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in<br />  the<br />          league ofÃ‚ those who fought forÃ‚ social<br />upliftment while<br />      remaining<br />          within the fight.Ã‚ And remember, to comeÃ‚<br />out of the faith<br />  and<br />      fight<br />          against it is a very easy, butÃ‚ think of the revolts<br />that an<br />    Adhi<br />          Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃ‚ had to face<br />whileÃ‚<br />  fighting for<br />      the<br />          cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in<br />          particular.Ã‚ Needless toÃ‚ say that this<br />extends to everyone<br />          whoÃ‚ fought or, is fighting for the cause<br />ofÃ‚ socialÃ‚<br />  equality<br />      while<br />          remaining within the faith.</p>
<p>            Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃ‚ orÃ‚<br />Nayanmars,Ã‚<br />  impress EVR.<br />          Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of<br />          discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in<br />whichÃ‚<br />  they<br />        mixed<br />          no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while<br />  going<br />    to<br />          theÃ‚ extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually<br />    discriminate<br />      in<br />          theÃ‚ name of God. I can atleast give references from<br />Azhwars<br />  for<br />          this, whileÃ‚ others can given ample references from<br />          theÃ‚ NayanmarsÃ‚ too.</p>
<p>            SimplyÃ‚ put, I still say that EVR neither had the<br />      knowledgeÃ‚ nor<br />          the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚ an<br />      AdhiÃ‚ Sankarar<br />          or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚ while remaining<br />with in<br />  the<br />        faith.<br />            Ã‚<br />            Regards,<br />            Venkatesh</p>

<p>            Venkatesh,<br />            Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the<br />      very<br />            very un popular vocational training based on their varanas.<br />  He<br />        also<br />            didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system<br />  in<br />          school<br />            for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every<br />    leader<br />        has<br />            +ves and -ves.<br />            So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be<br />      included<br />          is<br />            not a right argument here.<br />            Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift<br />  the<br />          society as much as possible. The ways which they followed<br />  were<br />          different but<br />            still the motive should be appreciated.<br />            I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and<br />  who<br />          shouldn't<br />            be.</p>

<p>              Nanda,</p>
<p>              IÃ?'â€šÃ‚ am surprised that you<br />sayÃ?'â€šÃ‚ EVR chose to<br />  fight,<br />    instead<br />      of<br />            gettingÃ?'â€šÃ‚ converted. Okay, he did<br />not get converted to<br />    another<br />            religion, but he could not stay<br />withinÃ?'â€šÃ‚ the faith and<br />  fight.<br />      He<br />          did<br />            become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On<br />  the<br />      other<br />            hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and<br />  UVS<br />      Iyer,<br />          all<br />            wereÃ?'â€šÃ‚<br />"practising"Ã?'â€šÃ‚ Hindus, who very<br />  muchÃ?'â€šÃ‚ believed in<br />      God<br />          and fought<br />            with authority, over the misrepresentation of the<br />  scriptures.</p>
<p>              In fact, whileÃ?'â€šÃ‚ some of EVR's<br />argument<br />      wereÃ?'â€šÃ‚ veryÃ?'â€šÃ‚<br />valid<br />          regarding<br />            the irrationalÃ?'â€šÃ‚ and<br />illogicalÃ?'â€šÃ‚ methods being<br />  followed,<br />          IÃ?'â€šÃ‚ think that<br />            he did not understand the true<br />scripturesÃ?'â€šÃ‚ or tenets<br />  of<br />        Hinduism,<br />            before deciding to take onÃ?'â€šÃ‚ it. On<br />the other hand,<br />  all those<br />        four<br />            above andÃ?'â€šÃ‚<br />thoseÃ?'â€šÃ‚ unsung heroes,<br />  understoodÃ?'â€šÃ‚ theÃ?'â€šÃ‚<br />          scriptures than EVR<br />            and that is what made them fight while still remaining<br />          withinÃ?'â€šÃ‚ the<br />            faith.</p>
<p>              So IMHO, the only credit that we<br />canÃ?'â€šÃ‚ give to EVR<br />  is that,<br />      he<br />          did<br />            not get converted into another religion. But his argument<br />  that<br />      one<br />            should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't<br />  gel<br />        with<br />            true rationalism.</p>
<p>              And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by<br />  Hinduism,<br />      well,<br />            then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or<br />          Pillayar<br />            withÃ?'â€šÃ‚<br />chappals?Ã?'â€šÃ‚ If EVR's grudge was against<br />  the<br />          discriminating<br />            Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all,<br />      Brahmins<br />          are<br />            notÃ?'â€šÃ‚ Gods. It is just funny to see<br />that, in process<br />      toÃ?'â€šÃ‚ taking<br />          on<br />            theÃ?'â€šÃ‚ discriminating Brahmins,<br />heÃ?'â€šÃ‚ and other<br />  fellow<br />    atheists<br />          have taken<br />            upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall,<br />  they<br />          cannot<br />            sustain the take.</p>
<p>              So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of<br />  those<br />      who<br />            fought for theÃ?'â€šÃ‚ social upliftment,<br />while remaining<br />  within<br />    the<br />          faith.<br />              Ã?'â€šÃ‚<br />              Regards,<br />              Venkatesh</p>

<p>              Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you<br />    and<br />              congratulations !!</p>
<p>              My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/<br />  modern<br />          stance<br />            on<br />              making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy<br />  (ie<br />          Ravana<br />              is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on<br />      authentic<br />              understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it<br />      Ravana<br />        or<br />              Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence<br />  and<br />              achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It<br />  is<br />      to<br />          the<br />              credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic<br />    style<br />          evil<br />              but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains<br />          liberation<br />              through surrender.</p>
<p>              What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really<br />  know<br />          about<br />              Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and<br />  prejudice<br />      in<br />          their<br />              own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps<br />  would<br />      be<br />          to<br />              fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

<p>Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in various other forums. Those who do not have the courage to fight within, are those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the original one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. Needless to say that our Politicians today are the standing examples of this Spineless Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too. </p>
<p>And do we have anyone who fought the bias from within the faith itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting from Adhi Sankarar to Ramanuja to, until recently Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et all. There are also many lesser known persons, who have fought a lot from within and I bet none of you will know even such persons existed. These are the common human beings we see day to day, who are silent revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />congratulations !! </p>
<p>My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance on <br />making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie Ravana <br />is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to the <br />credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains liberation <br />through surrender.</p>

        <p>eradication of untouchability, I think we can safely include Sri <br />Narayana guru for his involvement in the vaikom satyagraha and temple <br />entry movement. </p>
<p>with due respect to all the social reformers i think we need to take <br />in the arising of technology too as a prime mover for social change.<br />i beleive the invention of the engine as a source of mechanical power <br />removed slavery by rendering it totally inefficent and commercially <br />unviable.<br />remember the roman galleys. one engine would have replaced a few <br />hundred rowing slaves.<br />similarly urbanisation is one major reason that we need to take into <br />account for removal of untouchability.<br />the caste system is liteally breaking down before our eyes in towns.</p>

<p>        Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that <br />  both <br />        EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right <br />to <br />        freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.</p>
<p>        I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more <br />than <br />        10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt <br />    them, <br />      in <br />        TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. <br />It <br />        makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />        boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />    faith. <br />      In <br />        fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an <br />  eye' <br />        approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on <br />the <br />        other side. </p>
<p>        Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise <br />it <br />    with <br />        knowledge and responsibility is not something most people <br />know <br />    how <br />      to <br />        do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la <br />Ramana <br />        Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor <br />did <br />  he <br />        profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>        I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, <br />love <br />    to <br />        aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! <br />Also <br />        recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on <br />    Amazon).</p>

<p>          Vairam,</p>
<p>          Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the <br />vocational <br />      based <br />        teaching system.Ã‚ He too had faultered here and there. But <br />    remember, <br />        but for RajajiÃ‚ and UVSÃ‚ Iyer, the temple entry forÃ‚ all <br />the <br />        oppressedÃ‚ wouldÃ‚ not have happened then. Fine that it <br />could <br />  have <br />        happened now.Ã‚ But I am talking about the initiativestaken <br />by <br />    them.</p>
<p>          And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight <br />for <br />    the <br />        social cause. IÃ‚ only say that he could not do it while <br />  remaining <br />        within the faith. AsÃ‚ all of us know, his parentsÃ‚ and <br />ancestors <br />      were <br />        all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÃ‚ family of <br />    ardent <br />        believers, it is just his inabilityÃ‚ (yes, I would termÃ‚ it <br />as <br />    his <br />        inability) to fight for the social cause while still <br />remaining a <br />        believer. There can be thousands ofÃ‚ reasons given, toÃ‚ <br />explain, <br />    why <br />        he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />      didÃ‚ not <br />        haveÃ‚ either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the <br />courage <br />    to <br />        fight from within.</p>
<p>          I amÃ‚ even fine with the fact that heÃ‚ became an atheist. <br />But <br />    my <br />        upfront question was why toÃ‚ garland the idols with <br />chappals, <br />    just <br />        toÃ‚ exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Ã‚ And is this act, <br />not <br />      similar <br />        to whatÃ‚ a Bajrang Dal is doing toÃ‚ thechurches today. <br />When a <br />        Bajrang Dal doesÃ‚ this, it is "communal", but if EVR does <br />it, it <br />    is <br />        Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>          This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />        Sunnambu".Ã‚ (PleaseÃ‚ do not mistake me. I am not directing <br />this <br />        towardsÃ‚ you, but the same government and the media houses <br />that <br />  I <br />        decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>          Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in <br />the <br />        league ofÃ‚ those who fought forÃ‚ socialupliftment while <br />    remaining <br />        within the fight.Ã‚ And remember, to comeÃ‚ out of the faith <br />and <br />    fight <br />        against it is a very easy, butÃ‚ think of the revolts that an <br />  Adhi <br />        Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÃ‚ had to face whileÃ‚ <br />fighting for <br />    the <br />        cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />        particular.Ã‚ Needless toÃ‚ say that thisextends to everyone <br />        whoÃ‚ fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÃ‚ socialÃ‚ <br />equality <br />    while <br />        remaining within the faith. </p>
<p>          Why did not the works of AzhwarsÃ‚ orÃ‚Nayanmars,Ã‚  <br />impress EVR. <br />        Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />        discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÃ‚ <br />they <br />      mixed <br />        no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while <br />going <br />  to <br />        theÃ‚ extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually <br />  discriminate <br />    in <br />        theÃ‚ name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars <br />for <br />        this, whileÃ‚ others can given ample references from <br />        theÃ‚ NayanmarsÃ‚ too. </p>
<p>          SimplyÃ‚ put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />    knowledgeÃ‚ nor <br />        the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÃ‚ an <br />    AdhiÃ‚ Sankarar <br />        or Ramanuja to take on the societyÃ‚ while remaining with in <br />the <br />      faith.<br />          Ã‚ <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh</p>

<p>          Venkatesh,<br />          Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />    very <br />          very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. <br />He <br />      also <br />          didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system <br />in <br />        school <br />          for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every <br />  leader <br />      has <br />          +ves and -ves.<br />          So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be <br />    included <br />        is <br />          not a right argument here.<br />          Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift <br />the <br />        society as much as possible. The ways which they followed <br />were <br />        different but <br />          still the motive should be appreciated.<br />          I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and <br />who <br />        shouldn't <br />          be.</p>

<p>            Nanda, </p>
<p>            IÃ?'â€šÃ‚ am surprised that you sayÃ?'â€šÃ‚ EVR chose to <br />fight, <br />  instead <br />    of <br />          gettingÃ?'â€šÃ‚ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to <br />  another <br />          religion, but he could not stay withinÃ?'â€šÃ‚ the faith and <br />fight. <br />    He <br />        did <br />          become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On <br />the <br />    other <br />          hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and <br />UVS <br />    Iyer, <br />        all <br />          wereÃ?'â€šÃ‚ "practising"Ã?'â€šÃ‚ Hindus, who very <br />muchÃ?'â€šÃ‚ believed in <br />    God <br />        and fought <br />          with authority, over the misrepresentation of the <br />scriptures.</p>
<p>            In fact, whileÃ?'â€šÃ‚ some of EVR's argument <br />    wereÃ?'â€šÃ‚ veryÃ?'â€šÃ‚ valid <br />        regarding <br />          the irrationalÃ?'â€šÃ‚ and illogicalÃ?'â€šÃ‚ methods being <br />followed, <br />        IÃ?'â€šÃ‚ think that <br />          he did not understand the true scripturesÃ?'â€šÃ‚ or tenets <br />of <br />      Hinduism, <br />          before deciding to take onÃ?'â€šÃ‚ it. On the other hand, <br />all those <br />      four <br />          above andÃ?'â€šÃ‚ thoseÃ?'â€šÃ‚ unsung heroes, <br />understoodÃ?'â€šÃ‚ theÃ?'â€šÃ‚  <br />        scriptures than EVR <br />          and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />        withinÃ?'â€šÃ‚ the <br />          faith. </p>
<p>            So IMHO, the only credit that we canÃ?'â€šÃ‚ give to EVR <br />is that, <br />    he <br />        did <br />          not get converted into another religion. But his argument <br />that <br />    one <br />          should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't <br />gel <br />      with <br />          true rationalism.</p>
<p>            And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by <br />Hinduism, <br />    well, <br />          then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />        Pillayar <br />          withÃ?'â€šÃ‚ chappals?Ã?'â€šÃ‚ If EVR's grudge was against <br />the <br />        discriminating <br />          Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />    Brahmins <br />        are <br />          notÃ?'â€šÃ‚ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process <br />    toÃ?'â€šÃ‚ taking <br />        on <br />          theÃ?'â€šÃ‚ discriminating Brahmins, heÃ?'â€šÃ‚ and other <br />fellow <br />  atheists <br />        have taken <br />          upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, <br />they <br />        cannot <br />          sustain the take. </p>
<p>            So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of <br />those <br />    who <br />          fought for theÃ?'â€šÃ‚ social upliftment, while remaining <br />within <br />  the <br />        faith.<br />            Ã?'â€šÃ‚ <br />            Regards,<br />            Venkatesh</p>

<p>            Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you <br />  and <br />            congratulations !! </p>
<p>            My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/<br />modern <br />        stance <br />          on <br />            making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy <br />(ie <br />        Ravana <br />            is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on <br />    authentic <br />            understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it <br />    Ravana <br />      or <br />            Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence <br />and <br />            achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It <br />is <br />    to <br />        the <br />            credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic <br />  style <br />        evil <br />            but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />        liberation <br />            through surrender.</p>
<p>            What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really <br />know <br />        about <br />            Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and <br />prejudice <br />    in <br />        their <br />            own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps <br />would <br />    be <br />        to <br />            fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just noticed that someone said 10000 arts &amp; crafts perished in tamilnadu.Can we list at least some 100? 10000 seems to be exaggerated number to me.Also, talking of periyar and eradication of untouchability, I think we cansafely include Sri Narayana guru for his involvement in the vaikom satyagraha and temple entry movement. </p>
<p>Wikipedia's link on vaikom satyagraha is a recommended read on the kind of brutalities unleashed in the name of keeping up the caste.</p>

<p>      Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that <br />both <br />      EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right to <br />      freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.</p>
<p>      I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more than <br />      10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt <br />  them, <br />    in <br />      TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />      makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />      boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />  faith. <br />    In <br />      fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an <br />eye' <br />      approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />      other side. </p>
<p>      Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it <br />  with <br />      knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know <br />  how <br />    to <br />      do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la Ramana <br />      Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did <br />he <br />      profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>      I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love <br />  to <br />      aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />      recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on <br />  Amazon).</p>

<p>        Vairam,</p>
<p>        Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />    based <br />      teaching system.Â He too had faultered here and there. But <br />  remember, <br />      but for RajajiÂ and UVSÂ Iyer, the temple entry forÂ all the <br />      oppressedÂ wouldÂ not have happened then. Fine that it could <br />have <br />      happened now.Â But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />  them.</p>
<p>        And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />  the <br />      social cause. IÂ only say that he could not do it while <br />remaining <br />      within the faith. AsÂ all of us know, his parentsÂ and ancestors <br />    were <br />      all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÂ family of <br />  ardent <br />      believers, it is just his inabilityÂ (yes, I would termÂ itas <br />  his <br />      inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />      believer. There can be thousands ofÂ reasons given, toÂ explain, <br />  why <br />      he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />    didÂ not <br />      haveÂ either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />  to <br />      fight from within.</p>
<p>        I amÂ even fine with the fact that heÂ became an atheist.But <br />  my <br />      upfront question was why toÂ garland the idols with chappals, <br />  just <br />      toÂ exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Â And is this act, not <br />    similar <br />      to whatÂ a Bajrang Dal is doing toÂ the churches today. When a <br />      Bajrang Dal doesÂ this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />  is <br />      Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>        This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />      Sunnambu".Â (PleaseÂ do not mistake me. I am not directingthis <br />      towardsÂ you, but the same government and the media houses that <br />I <br />      decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>        Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />      league ofÂ those who fought forÂ social upliftment while <br />  remaining <br />      within the fight.Â And remember, to comeÂ out of the faith and <br />  fight <br />      against it is a very easy, butÂ think of the revolts that an <br />Adhi <br />      Sankarar or Ramanuja would haveÂ had to face whileÂ fighting for <br />  the <br />      cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />      particular.Â Needless toÂ say that this extends to everyone <br />      whoÂ fought or, is fighting for the cause ofÂ socialÂ equality <br />  while <br />      remaining within the faith. </p>
<p>        Why did not the works of AzhwarsÂ orÂ Nayanmars,Â impress EVR. <br />      Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />      discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in whichÂ they <br />    mixed <br />      no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going <br />to <br />      theÂ extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually <br />discriminate <br />  in <br />      theÂ name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />      this, whileÂ others can given ample references from <br />      theÂ NayanmarsÂ too. </p>
<p>        SimplyÂ put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />  knowledgeÂ nor <br />      the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars orÂ an <br />  AdhiÂ Sankarar <br />      or Ramanuja to take on the societyÂ while remaining with in the <br />    faith.<br />        Â <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>

<p>        Venkatesh,<br />        Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />  very <br />        very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He <br />    also <br />        didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in <br />      school <br />        for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every <br />leader <br />    has <br />        +ves and -ves.<br />        So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be <br />  included <br />      is <br />        not a right argument here.<br />        Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />      society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were <br />      different but <br />        still the motive should be appreciated.<br />        I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and who <br />      shouldn't <br />        be.</p>

<p>          Nanda, </p>
<p>          IÃ‚Â am surprised that you sayÃ‚Â EVR chose to fight, <br />instead <br />  of <br />        gettingÃ‚Â converted. Okay, he did not get converted to <br />another <br />        religion, but he could not stay withinÃ‚Â the faith and fight. <br />  He <br />      did <br />        become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />  other <br />        hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />  Iyer, <br />      all <br />        wereÃ‚Â "practising"Ã‚Â Hindus, who very muchÃ‚Â believed in <br />  God <br />      and fought <br />        with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>          In fact, whileÃ‚Â some of EVR's argument <br />  wereÃ‚Â veryÃ‚Â valid <br />      regarding <br />        the irrationalÃ‚Â and illogicalÃ‚Â methods being followed, <br />      IÃ‚Â think that <br />        he did not understand the true scripturesÃ‚Â or tenets of <br />    Hinduism, <br />        before deciding to take onÃ‚Â it. On the other hand, all those <br />    four <br />        above andÃ‚Â thoseÃ‚Â unsung heroes, understoodÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â  <br />      scriptures than EVR <br />        and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />      withinÃ‚Â the <br />        faith. </p>
<p>          So IMHO, the only credit that we canÃ‚Â give toEVR is that, <br />  he <br />      did <br />        not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />  one <br />        should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel <br />    with <br />        true rationalism.</p>
<p>          And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />  well, <br />        then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />      Pillayar <br />        withÃ‚Â chappals?Ã‚Â If EVR's grudge was against the <br />      discriminating <br />        Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />  Brahmins <br />      are <br />        notÃ‚Â Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process <br />  toÃ‚Â taking <br />      on <br />        theÃ‚Â discriminating Brahmins, heÃ‚Â and other fellow <br />atheists <br />      have taken <br />        upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />      cannot <br />        sustain the take. </p>
<p>          So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those <br />  who <br />        fought for theÃ‚Â social upliftment, while remaining within <br />the <br />      faith.<br />          Ã‚Â <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh</p>

<p>          ===========Quote= ========= ==<br />          What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know <br />      about <br />          Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice <br />  in <br />      their <br />          own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps would <br />  be <br />      to <br />          fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.<br />          ==========Unquote= ========= =</p>
<p>          Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />      various <br />        other forums. Those who do not have the courage to <br />    fightÃ‚Â within, <br />      are <br />        those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the <br />      original <br />        one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. <br />NeedlessÃ‚Â to <br />    say <br />      that <br />        our Politicians today are the standing examples of this <br />  Spineless <br />        Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too. </p>
<p>          And do we haveÃ‚Â anyone who fought the bias from within the <br />      faith <br />        itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting fromÃ‚Â AdhiÃ‚Â Sankarar to <br />      Ramanuja to, <br />        until recentlyÃ‚Â Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et <br />  all.Ã‚Â There <br />      are also <br />        many lesser known persons, whoÃ‚Â have fought a lot from <br />within <br />    and <br />      I <br />        bet noneÃ‚Â of you will know even such persons existed. These <br />  are <br />      the <br />        commonÃ‚Â human beings we see day toÃ‚Â day, who are silent <br />        revolutionaries.<br />          Ã‚Â <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you <br />and <br />          congratulations !! </p>
<p>          My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern <br />      stance <br />        on <br />          making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie <br />      Ravana <br />          is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on <br />  authentic <br />          understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it <br />  Ravana <br />    or <br />          Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />          achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is <br />  to <br />      the <br />          credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic <br />style <br />      evil <br />          but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />      liberation <br />          through surrender.</p>
<p>          What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know <br />      about <br />          Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice <br />  in <br />      their <br />          own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps would <br />  be <br />      to <br />          fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

<p>            His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to <br />  mark <br />          victory <br />            of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by <br />        villagers</p>
<p>            of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring <br />  out <br />      a <br />            procession carrying his idol. </p>
<p>            "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of <br />  Dravidian <br />      Gaud <br />            tribe and we consider him as our ancestor. We hold a fair <br />  on <br />      this <br />          day <br />            so that the next generation would remember his sacrifice <br />  and <br />          continue <br />            the tradition," said Dhanirao Boddh, Indian Dalit <br />Panther's <br />          President <br />            and one of the organisers of the annual festival on <br />  Dussehra. </p>
<p>            In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning <br />  effigies <br />          which, <br />            it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>            "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either <br />  from <br />            Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />      another <br />            member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>            "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />        Ravana's <br />            effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an <br />    immediate <br />        ban <br />          on <br />            the practice. </p>
<p>            Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring <br />  out <br />      a <br />            procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, <br />  Gautam <br />          Budh, <br />            Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>            Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be <br />  organised <br />        where <br />            Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

<p>              Most of the people who have read Kambaramayana or have <br />  heard <br />      the <br />            story<br />              of Ramayana in Tamil tend to believe that Ravana was a <br />  true <br />          Dravidan<br />              King. That being the case after Dravidian movement many <br />      people <br />          felt,<br />              Ravana was wronged and killed by Rama an Aryan King. So <br />  how <br />      true <br />          is<br />              the Aryan- Dravidian conflict in Ramayana ?

This essay is <br />    intended <br />      to <br />            probe<br />              through the two questions and try to present the answer.</p>

<p>      Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that <br />both <br />      EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right to <br />      freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.</p>
<p>      I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more than <br />      10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt <br />  them, <br />    in <br />      TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />      makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />      boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />  faith. <br />    In <br />      fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an <br />eye' <br />      approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />      other side. </p>
<p>      Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it <br />  with <br />      knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know <br />  how <br />    to <br />      do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la Ramana <br />      Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did <br />he <br />      profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>      I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love <br />  to <br />      aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />      recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on <br />  Amazon).</p>

<p>        Vairam,</p>
<p>        Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />    based <br />      teaching system. He too had faultered here and there. But <br />  remember, <br />      but for Rajaji and UVS Iyer, the temple entry for all the <br />      oppressed would not have happened then. Fine that it could <br />have <br />      happened now. But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />  them.</p>
<p>        And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />  the <br />      social cause. I only say that he could not do it while <br />remaining <br />      within the faith. As all of us know, his parents and ancestors <br />    were <br />      all ardent believers of God. So being born into a family of <br />  ardent <br />      believers, it is just his inability (yes, I would term it as <br />  his <br />      inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />      believer. There can be thousands of reasons given, to explain, <br />  why <br />      he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />    did not <br />      have either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />  to <br />      fight from within.</p>
<p>        I am even fine with the fact that he became an atheist. But <br />  my <br />      upfront question was why to garland the idols with chappals, <br />  just <br />      to exhibit his atheistic inclinations. And is this act, not <br />    similar <br />      to what a Bajrang Dal is doing to the churches today. When a <br />      Bajrang Dal does this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />  is <br />      Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>        This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />      Sunnambu". (Please do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />      towards you, but the same government and the media houses that <br />I <br />      decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>        Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />      league of those who fought for social upliftment while <br />  remaining <br />      within the fight. And remember, to come out of the faith and <br />  fight <br />      against it is a very easy, but think of the revolts that an <br />Adhi <br />      Sankarar or Ramanuja would have had to face while fighting for <br />  the <br />      cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />      particular. Needless to say that this extends to everyone <br />      who fought or, is fighting for the cause of social equality <br />  while <br />      remaining within the faith. </p>
<p>        Why did not the works of Azhwars or Nayanmars, impress EVR. <br />      Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />      discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in which they <br />    mixed <br />      no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going <br />to <br />      the extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually <br />discriminate <br />  in <br />      the name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />      this, while others can given ample references from <br />      the Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>        Simply put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />  knowledge nor <br />      the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars or an <br />  Adhi Sankarar <br />      or Ramanuja to take on the society while remaining with in the <br />    faith.<br />         <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>

<p>        Venkatesh,<br />        Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />  very <br />        very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He <br />    also <br />        didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in <br />      school <br />        for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every <br />leader <br />    has <br />        +ves and -ves.<br />        So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be <br />  included <br />      is <br />        not a right argument here.<br />        Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />      society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were <br />      different but <br />        still the motive should be appreciated.<br />        I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and who <br />      shouldn't <br />        be.</p>

<p>          Nanda, </p>
<p>          IÂ am surprised that you sayÂ EVR chose to fight, <br />instead <br />  of <br />        gettingÂ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to <br />another <br />        religion, but he could not stay withinÂ the faith and fight. <br />  He <br />      did <br />        become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />  other <br />        hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />  Iyer, <br />      all <br />        wereÂ "practising"Â  Hindus, who very muchÂ believed in <br />  God <br />      and fought <br />        with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>          In fact, whileÂ some of EVR's argument <br />  wereÂ veryÂ valid <br />      regarding <br />        the irrationalÂ and illogicalÂ methods being followed, <br />      IÂ think that <br />        he did not understand the true scripturesÂ or tenets of <br />    Hinduism, <br />        before deciding to take onÂ it. On the other hand, all those <br />    four <br />        above andÂ thoseÂ unsung heroes, understoodÂ theÂ  <br />      scriptures than EVR <br />        and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />      withinÂ the <br />        faith. </p>
<p>          So IMHO, the only credit that we canÂ give to EVR is that, <br />  he <br />      did <br />        not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />  one <br />        should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel <br />    with <br />        true rationalism.</p>
<p>          And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />  well, <br />        then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />      Pillayar <br />        withÂ chappals?Â  If EVR's grudge was against the <br />      discriminating <br />        Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />  Brahmins <br />      are <br />        notÂ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process <br />  toÂ taking <br />      on <br />        theÂ discriminating Brahmins, heÂ and other fellow <br />atheists <br />      have taken <br />        upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />      cannot <br />        sustain the take. </p>
<p>          So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those <br />  who <br />        fought for theÂ social upliftment, while remaining within <br />the <br />      faith.<br />          Â <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh</p>

<p>          Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />      various <br />        other forums. Those who do not have the courage to <br />    fightÂ within, <br />      are <br />        those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the <br />      original <br />        one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. <br />NeedlessÂ to <br />    say <br />      that <br />        our Politicians today are the standing examples of this <br />  Spineless <br />        Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too. </p>
<p>          And do we haveÂ anyone who fought the bias from within the <br />      faith <br />        itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting fromÂ AdhiÂ Sankarar to <br />      Ramanuja to, <br />        until recentlyÂ Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et <br />  all.Â There <br />      are also <br />        many lesser known persons, whoÂ have fought a lot from <br />within <br />    and <br />      I <br />        bet noneÂ of you will know even such persons existed. These <br />  are <br />      the <br />        commonÂ human beings we see day toÂ day, who are silent <br />        revolutionaries.<br />          Â <br />          Regards,<br />          Venkatesh</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you <br />and <br />          congratulations !! </p>
<p>          My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern <br />      stance <br />        on <br />          making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie <br />      Ravana <br />          is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on <br />  authentic <br />          understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it <br />  Ravana <br />    or <br />          Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />          achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is <br />  to <br />      the <br />          credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic <br />style <br />      evil <br />          but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />      liberation <br />          through surrender.</p>
<p>          What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know <br />      about <br />          Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice <br />  in <br />      their <br />          own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps would <br />  be <br />      to <br />          fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

<p>            His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to <br />  mark <br />          victory <br />            of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by <br />        villagers</p>
<p>            of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring <br />  out <br />      a <br />            procession carrying his idol. </p>
<p>            "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of <br />  Dravidian <br />      Gaud <br />            tribe and we consider him as our ancestor.

<p>            In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning <br />  effigies <br />          which, <br />            it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>            "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either <br />  from <br />            Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />      another <br />            member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>            "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />        Ravana's <br />            effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an <br />    immediate <br />        ban <br />          on <br />            the practice. </p>
<p>            Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring <br />  out <br />      a <br />            procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, <br />  Gautam <br />          Budh, <br />            Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>            Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be <br />  organised <br />        where <br />            Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

        <p>Vairam, I had no idea, what was the case about? I thought her book <br />was well researched and balanced. BTW it even included Periyar's <br />abusive essays on the Ramayana.</p>

<p>    Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that both <br />    EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right to <br />    freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.</p>
<p>    I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more than <br />    10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt <br />them, <br />  in <br />    TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />    makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />    boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />faith. <br />  In <br />    fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an eye' <br />    approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />    other side. </p>
<p>    Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it <br />with <br />    knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know <br />how <br />  to <br />    do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la Ramana <br />    Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did he <br />    profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>    I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love <br />to <br />    aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />    recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on <br />Amazon).</p>

<p>      Vairam,</p>
<p>      Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />  based <br />    teaching system. He too had faultered here and there. But <br />remember, <br />    but for Rajaji and UVS Iyer, the temple entry for all the <br />    oppressed would not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />    happened now. But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />them.</p>
<p>      And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />the <br />    social cause. I only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />    within the faith. As all of us know, his parents and ancestors <br />  were <br />    all ardent believers of God. So being born into a family of <br />ardent <br />    believers, it is just his inability (yes, I would term it as <br />his <br />    inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />    believer. There can be thousands of reasons given, to explain, <br />why <br />    he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />  did not <br />    have either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />to <br />    fight from within.</p>
<p>      I am even fine with the fact that he became an atheist. But <br />my <br />    upfront question was why to garland the idols with chappals, <br />just <br />    to exhibit his atheistic inclinations. And is this act, not <br />  similar <br />    to what a Bajrang Dal is doing to the churches today. When a <br />    Bajrang Dal does this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />is <br />    Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>      This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />    Sunnambu". (Please do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />    towards you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />    decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>      Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />    league of those who fought for social upliftment while <br />remaining <br />    within the fight. And remember, to come out of the faith and <br />fight <br />    against it is a very easy, but think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />    Sankarar or Ramanuja would have had to face while fighting for <br />the <br />    cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />    particular. Needless to say that this extends to everyone <br />    who fought or, is fighting for the cause of social equality <br />while <br />    remaining within the faith. </p>
<p>      Why did not the works of Azhwars or Nayanmars, impressEVR. <br />    Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />    discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in which they <br />  mixed <br />    no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />    the extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate <br />in <br />    the name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />    this, while others can given ample references from <br />    the Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>      Simply put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />knowledge nor <br />    the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars or an <br />Adhi Sankarar <br />    or Ramanuja to take on the society while remaining with in the <br />  faith.<br />       <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh</p>

<p>      Venkatesh,<br />      Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />very <br />      very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He <br />  also <br />      didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in <br />    school <br />      for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader <br />  has <br />      +ves and -ves.<br />      So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be <br />included <br />    is <br />      not a right argument here.<br />      Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />    society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were <br />    different but <br />      still the motive should be appreciated.<br />      I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and who <br />    shouldn't <br />      be.</p>

<p>        Nanda, </p>
<p>        IÂ am surprised that you sayÂ EVR chose to fight, instead <br />of <br />      gettingÂ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />      religion, but he could not stay withinÂ the faith and fight. <br />He <br />    did <br />      become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />other <br />      hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />Iyer, <br />    all <br />      wereÂ "practising"Â  Hindus, who very muchÂ believed in <br />God <br />    and fought <br />      with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>        In fact, whileÂ some of EVR's argument <br />wereÂ veryÂ valid <br />    regarding <br />      the irrationalÂ and illogicalÂ methods being followed, <br />    IÂ think that <br />      he did not understand the true scripturesÂ or tenets of <br />  Hinduism, <br />      before deciding to take onÂ it. On the other hand, all those <br />  four <br />      above andÂ thoseÂ unsung heroes, understoodÂ theÂ  <br />    scriptures than EVR <br />      and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />    withinÂ the <br />      faith. </p>
<p>        So IMHO, the only credit that we canÂ give to EVR is that, <br />he <br />    did <br />      not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />one <br />      should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel <br />  with <br />      true rationalism.</p>
<p>        And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />well, <br />      then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />    Pillayar <br />      withÂ chappals?Â  If EVR's grudge was against the <br />    discriminating <br />      Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />Brahmins <br />    are <br />      notÂ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process <br />toÂ taking <br />    on <br />      theÂ discriminating Brahmins, heÂ and other fellow atheists <br />    have taken <br />      upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />    cannot <br />      sustain the take. </p>
<p>        So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those <br />who <br />      fought for theÂ social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />    faith.<br />        Â <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>

<p>        Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />    various <br />      other forums. Those who do not have the courage to <br />  fightÂ within, <br />    are <br />      those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the <br />    original <br />      one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. NeedlessÂ to <br />  say <br />    that <br />      our Politicians today are the standing examples of this <br />Spineless <br />      Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too. </p>
<p>        And do we haveÂ anyone who fought the bias from within the <br />    faith <br />      itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting fromÂ AdhiÂ Sankarar to <br />    Ramanuja to, <br />      until recentlyÂ Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et <br />all.Â There <br />    are also <br />      many lesser known persons, whoÂ have fought a lot from within <br />  and <br />    I <br />      bet noneÂ of you will know even such persons existed. These <br />are <br />    the <br />      commonÂ human beings we see day toÂ day, who are silent <br />      revolutionaries.<br />        Â <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />        congratulations !! </p>
<p>        My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern <br />    stance <br />      on <br />        making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie <br />    Ravana <br />        is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on <br />authentic <br />        understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it <br />Ravana <br />  or <br />        Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />        achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is <br />to <br />    the <br />        credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style <br />    evil <br />        but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />    liberation <br />        through surrender.</p>
<p>        What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know <br />    about <br />        Buddhism?

<p>          of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring <br />out <br />    a <br />          procession carrying his idol. </p>

<p>          In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning <br />effigies <br />        which, <br />          it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>          "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either <br />from <br />          Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />    another <br />          member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>          "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />      Ravana's <br />          effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an <br />  immediate <br />      ban <br />        on <br />          the practice. </p>
<p>          Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring <br />out <br />    a <br />          procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, <br />Gautam <br />        Budh, <br />          Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>with due respect to Periyar and his social reformation</p>
<p>atheism is fine but dont thrust it on somebody.<br />but ironically wherever there is a big temple there is a periyar <br />statue facing it or near it.<br />god kept him close i guess.<br />its not only india.<br />there was this american atheist association fearing which a part of <br />the bible was not read on the moon by the initial astronauts.<br />nasa was afraid of being sued.</p>
<p>this association is responsible for stopping of prayyers in may <br />states of the usa.</p>
<p>nice article in wikipedia a few days before.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>Sulochana is Indrajit's wife, she is a Naga kanya or daughter of <br />Adisesha/Lakshmana. Lakshmana is actually Ravana's son's father in <br />law! It is fascinating to hear of temples built by Mandodhari, really <br />I had no idea about that! Is there any more information on her?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Malathi</p>
<p>  landed in india yet?</p>
<p>  by the way do you know who the mythological charecter sulochana is?<br />  she happens to be the wife of indrajit.<br />  there seem to be so many stories in our epics about her.<br />  i think the first kannada film ever was on her. quite a few tamil <br />  movies too.</p>
<p>  ravana and family seem to have their own set of stories too.<br />  i remember a discussion in our group on how the uthirakosamangai <br />  temple was first built by mandothari.</p>
<p>  sita initiated rameshwaram and mandothari is connected with a <br />  neighbouring temple.</p>

<p>    Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that both <br />    EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right to <br />    freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.</p>
<p>    I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more than <br />    10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt <br />them, <br />  in <br />    TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />    makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />    boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any <br />faith. <br />  In <br />    fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an eye' <br />    approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />    other side. </p>
<p>    Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it <br />with <br />    knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know <br />how <br />  to <br />    do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la Ramana <br />    Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did he <br />    profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>    I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love <br />to <br />    aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />    recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on <br />Amazon).</p>

<p>      Vairam,</p>
<p>      Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />  based <br />    teaching system. He too had faultered here and there. But <br />remember, <br />    but for Rajaji and UVS Iyer, the temple entry for all the <br />    oppressed would not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />    happened now. But I am talking about the initiatives taken by <br />them.</p>
<p>      And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />  the <br />    social cause. I only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />    within the faith. As all of us know, his parents and ancestors <br />were <br />    all ardent believers of God. So being born into a family of <br />ardent <br />    believers, it is just his inability (yes, I would term it as <br />his <br />    inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />    believer. There can be thousands of reasons given, to explain, <br />why <br />    he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />  did not <br />    have either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage <br />to <br />    fight from within.</p>
<p>      I am even fine with the fact that he became an atheist. But <br />my <br />    upfront question was why to garland the idols with chappals, <br />just <br />    to exhibit his atheistic inclinations. And is this act, not <br />similar <br />    to what a Bajrang Dal is doing to the churches today. When a <br />    Bajrang Dal does this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it <br />is <br />    Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>      This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />    Sunnambu". (Please do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />    towards you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />    decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>      Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />    league of those who fought for social upliftment while <br />remaining <br />    within the fight. And remember, to come out of the faith and <br />fight <br />    against it is a very easy, but think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />    Sankarar or Ramanuja would have had to face while fighting for <br />the <br />    cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />    particular. Needless to say that this extends to everyone <br />    who fought or, is fighting for the cause of social equality <br />while <br />    remaining within the faith. </p>
<p>      Why did not the works of Azhwars or Nayanmars, impressEVR. <br />    Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />    discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in which they <br />  mixed <br />    no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />    the extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate <br />in <br />    the name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />    this, while others can given ample references from <br />    the Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>      Simply put, I still say that EVR neither had the <br />knowledge nor <br />    the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars or an <br />Adhi Sankarar <br />    or Ramanuja to take on the society while remaining with in the <br />  faith.<br />       <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh</p>

<p>      Venkatesh,<br />      Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the <br />very <br />      very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He <br />  also <br />      didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in <br />    school <br />      for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader <br />  has <br />      +ves and -ves.<br />      So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be <br />included <br />    is <br />      not a right argument here.<br />      Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />    society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were <br />    different but <br />      still the motive should be appreciated.<br />      I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and who <br />    shouldn't <br />      be.</p>

<p>        Nanda, </p>
<p>        IÂ am surprised that you sayÂ EVR chose to fight, instead <br />of <br />      gettingÂ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />      religion, but he could not stay withinÂ the faith and fight. <br />He <br />    did <br />      become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />  other <br />      hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />  Iyer, <br />    all <br />      wereÂ "practising"Â  Hindus, who very muchÂ believed in <br />God <br />    and fought <br />      with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>        In fact, whileÂ some of EVR's argument <br />wereÂ veryÂ valid <br />    regarding <br />      the irrationalÂ and illogicalÂ methods being followed, <br />    IÂ think that <br />      he did not understand the true scripturesÂ or tenets of <br />Hinduism, <br />      before deciding to take onÂ it. On the other hand, all those <br />four <br />      above andÂ thoseÂ unsung heroes, understoodÂ theÂ  <br />    scriptures than EVR <br />      and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />    withinÂ the <br />      faith. </p>
<p>        So IMHO, the only credit that we canÂ give to EVR is that, <br />he <br />    did <br />      not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />  one <br />      should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel <br />  with <br />      true rationalism.</p>
<p>        And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />  well, <br />      then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />    Pillayar <br />      withÂ chappals?Â  If EVR's grudge was against the <br />    discriminating <br />      Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />  Brahmins <br />    are <br />      notÂ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process <br />toÂ taking <br />    on <br />      theÂ discriminating Brahmins, heÂ and other fellow atheists <br />    have taken <br />      upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />    cannot <br />      sustain the take. </p>
<p>        So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those <br />who <br />      fought for theÂ social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />    faith.<br />        Â <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>

<p>        Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />    various <br />      other forums. Those who do not have the courage to <br />fightÂ within, <br />    are <br />      those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the <br />    original <br />      one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. NeedlessÂ to <br />say <br />    that <br />      our Politicians today are the standing examples of this <br />Spineless <br />      Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too. </p>
<p>        And do we haveÂ anyone who fought the bias from within the <br />    faith <br />      itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting fromÂ AdhiÂ Sankarar to <br />    Ramanuja to, <br />      until recentlyÂ Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et <br />all.Â There <br />    are also <br />      many lesser known persons, whoÂ have fought a lot from within <br />and <br />    I <br />      bet noneÂ of you will know even such persons existed. These <br />are <br />    the <br />      commonÂ human beings we see day toÂ day, who are silent <br />      revolutionaries.<br />        Â <br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />        congratulations !! </p>
<p>        My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern <br />    stance <br />      on <br />        making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie <br />    Ravana <br />        is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on <br />  authentic <br />        understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it <br />Ravana <br />  or <br />        Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />        achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is <br />to <br />    the <br />        credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style <br />    evil <br />        but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />    liberation <br />        through surrender.</p>
<p>        What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know <br />    about <br />        Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice <br />in <br />    their <br />        own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps would <br />be <br />    to <br />        fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

<p>          His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to <br />mark <br />        victory <br />          of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by <br />      villagers</p>
<p>          of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring <br />  out <br />    a <br />          procession carrying his idol. </p>
<p>          "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of <br />Dravidian <br />    Gaud <br />          tribe and we consider him as our ancestor.

<p>          In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning <br />  effigies <br />        which, <br />          it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>          "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either <br />  from <br />          Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />    another <br />          member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>          "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />      Ravana's <br />          effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an <br />  immediate <br />      ban <br />        on <br />          the practice. </p>
<p>          Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring <br />  out <br />    a <br />          procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, <br />  Gautam <br />        Budh, <br />          Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>          Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be <br />organised <br />      where <br />          Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

<p>atheism is fine but dont thrust it on somebody.<br />but ironically wherever there is a big temple there is a periyar <br />statue facing it or near it.<br />god kept him close i guess.<br />its not only india.<br />there was this american atheist association fearing which a part of <br />the bible was not read on the moon by the initial astronauts.<br />nasa was afraid of being sued.</p>
<p>this association is responsible for stopping of prayyers in may <br />states of the usa.</p>
<p>nice article in wikipedia a few days before.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance <br />on <br />  making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie Ravana <br />  is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />  understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />  Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />  achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to the <br />  credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />  but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains liberation <br />  through surrender.</p>

<p>    In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning effigies <br />  which, <br />    it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>    "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either from <br />    Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />another <br />    member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>    "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />Ravana's <br />    effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an immediate <br />ban <br />  on <br />    the practice. </p>
<p>    Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring out a <br />    procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, Gautam <br />  Budh, <br />    Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>    Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be organised <br />where <br />    Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi</p>
<p>landed in india yet?</p>
<p>by the way do you know who the mythological charecter sulochana is?<br />she happens to be the wife of indrajit.<br />there seem to be so many stories in our epics about her.<br />i think the first kannada film ever was on her. quite a few tamil <br />movies too.</p>
<p>ravana and family seem to have their own set of stories too.<br />i remember a discussion in our group on how the uthirakosamangai <br />temple was first built by mandothari.</p>
<p>sita initiated rameshwaram and mandothari is connected with a <br />neighbouring temple.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that both <br />  EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right to <br />  freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.</p>
<p>  I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more than <br />  10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt them, <br />in <br />  TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />  makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />  boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any faith. <br />In <br />  fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an eye' <br />  approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />  other side. </p>
<p>  Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it with <br />  knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know how <br />to <br />  do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la Ramana <br />  Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did he <br />  profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>  I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love to <br />  aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />  recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on Amazon).</p>

<p>    Vairam,</p>
<p>    Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />based <br />  teaching system. He too had faultered here and there. But remember, <br />  but for Rajaji and UVS Iyer, the temple entry for all the <br />  oppressed would not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />  happened now. But I am talking about the initiatives taken by them.</p>
<p>    And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for <br />the <br />  social cause. I only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />  within the faith. As all of us know, his parents and ancestors were <br />  all ardent believers of God. So being born into a family of ardent <br />  believers, it is just his inability (yes, I would term it as his <br />  inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />  believer. There can be thousands of reasons given, to explain, why <br />  he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />did not <br />  have either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage to <br />  fight from within.</p>
<p>    I am even fine with the fact that he became an atheist. But my <br />  upfront question was why to garland the idols with chappals, just <br />  to exhibit his atheistic inclinations. And is this act, not similar <br />  to what a Bajrang Dal is doing to the churches today. When a <br />  Bajrang Dal does this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it is <br />  Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>    This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />  Sunnambu". (Please do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />  towards you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />  decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>    Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />  league of those who fought for social upliftment while remaining <br />  within the fight. And remember, to come out of the faith and fight <br />  against it is a very easy, but think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />  Sankarar or Ramanuja would have had to face while fighting for the <br />  cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />  particular. Needless to say that this extends to everyone <br />  who fought or, is fighting for the cause of social equality while <br />  remaining within the faith. </p>
<p>    Why did not the works of Azhwars or Nayanmars, impress EVR. <br />  Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />  discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in which they <br />mixed <br />  no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />  the extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate in <br />  the name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />  this, while others can given ample references from <br />  the Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>    Simply put, I still say that EVR neither had the knowledge nor <br />  the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars or an Adhi Sankarar <br />  or Ramanuja to take on the society while remaining with in the <br />faith.<br />     <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Venkatesh,<br />    Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />    very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He <br />also <br />    didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in <br />  school <br />    for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader <br />has <br />    +ves and -ves.<br />    So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be included <br />  is <br />    not a right argument here.<br />    Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />  society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were <br />  different but <br />    still the motive should be appreciated.<br />    I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and who <br />  shouldn't <br />    be.</p>

<p>      Nanda, </p>
<p>      IÂ am surprised that you sayÂ EVR chose to fight,instead of <br />    gettingÂ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />    religion, but he could not stay withinÂ the faith and fight. He <br />  did <br />    become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the <br />other <br />    hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS <br />Iyer, <br />  all <br />    wereÂ "practising"Â  Hindus, who very muchÂ believed in God <br />  and fought <br />    with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>      In fact, whileÂ some of EVR's argument wereÂ veryÂ valid <br />  regarding <br />    the irrationalÂ and illogicalÂ methods being followed, <br />  IÂ think that <br />    he did not understand the true scripturesÂ or tenets of Hinduism, <br />    before deciding to take onÂ it. On the other hand, all those four <br />    above andÂ thoseÂ unsung heroes, understoodÂ theÂ  <br />  scriptures than EVR <br />    and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />  withinÂ the <br />    faith. </p>
<p>      So IMHO, the only credit that we canÂ give to EVR is that, he <br />  did <br />    not get converted into another religion. But his argument that <br />one <br />    should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel <br />with <br />    true rationalism.</p>
<p>      And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, <br />well, <br />    then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />  Pillayar <br />    withÂ chappals?Â  If EVR's grudge was against the <br />  discriminating <br />    Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, <br />Brahmins <br />  are <br />    notÂ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process toÂ taking <br />  on <br />    theÂ discriminating Brahmins, heÂ and other fellow atheists <br />  have taken <br />    upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />  cannot <br />    sustain the take. </p>
<p>      So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those who <br />    fought for theÂ social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />  faith.<br />      Â <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh</p>

<p>        In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning <br />effigies <br />      which, <br />        it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>        "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either <br />from <br />        Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />  another <br />        member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>        "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />    Ravana's <br />        effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an <br />immediate <br />    ban <br />      on <br />        the practice. </p>
<p>        Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring <br />out <br />  a <br />        procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, <br />Gautam <br />      Budh, <br />        Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that both <br />  EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right to <br />  freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.</p>
<p>  I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more than <br />  10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt them, <br />in <br />  TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />  makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />  boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any faith. <br />In <br />  fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an eye' <br />  approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />  other side. </p>
<p>  Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it with <br />  knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know how <br />to <br />  do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la Ramana <br />  Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did he <br />  profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>  I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love to <br />  aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />  recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on Amazon).</p>

<p>    Vairam,</p>
<p>    Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational <br />based <br />  teaching system. He too had faultered here and there. But remember, <br />  but for Rajaji and UVS Iyer, the temple entry for all the <br />  oppressed would not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />  happened now. But I am talking about the initiatives taken by them.</p>
<p>    And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for the <br />  social cause. I only say that he could not do it while remaining <br />  within the faith. As all of us know, his parents and ancestors <br />were <br />  all ardent believers of God. So being born into a family of ardent <br />  believers, it is just his inability (yes, I would term it as his <br />  inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />  believer. There can be thousands of reasons given, to explain, why <br />  he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he <br />did not <br />  have either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage to <br />  fight from within.</p>
<p>    I am even fine with the fact that he became an atheist. But my <br />  upfront question was why to garland the idols with chappals, just <br />  to exhibit his atheistic inclinations. And is this act, not <br />similar <br />  to what a Bajrang Dal is doing to the churches today. When a <br />  Bajrang Dal does this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it is <br />  Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>    This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />  Sunnambu". (Please do not mistake me. I am not directing this <br />  towards you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />  decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>    Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />  league of those who fought for social upliftment while remaining <br />  within the fight. And remember, to come out of the faith and fight <br />  against it is a very easy, but think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />  Sankarar or Ramanuja would have had to face while fighting for the <br />  cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />  particular. Needless to say that this extends to everyone <br />  who fought or, is fighting for the cause of social equality while <br />  remaining within the faith. </p>
<p>    Why did not the works of Azhwars or Nayanmars, impress EVR. <br />  Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of <br />  discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in which they <br />mixed <br />  no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />  the extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate in <br />  the name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />  this, while others can given ample references from <br />  the Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>    Simply put, I still say that EVR neither had the knowledge nor <br />  the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars or an Adhi Sankarar <br />  or Ramanuja to take on the society while remaining with in the <br />faith.<br />     <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Venkatesh,<br />    Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />    very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He <br />also <br />    didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in <br />  school <br />    for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader <br />has <br />    +ves and -ves.<br />    So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be included <br />  is <br />    not a right argument here.<br />    Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />  society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were <br />  different but <br />    still the motive should be appreciated.<br />    I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and who <br />  shouldn't <br />    be.</p>

<p>      Nanda, </p>
<p>      IÂ am surprised that you sayÂ EVR chose to fight,instead of <br />    gettingÂ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />    religion, but he could not stay withinÂ the faith and fight. He <br />  did <br />    become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the other <br />    hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS Iyer, <br />  all <br />    wereÂ "practising"Â  Hindus, who very muchÂ believed in God <br />  and fought <br />    with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>      In fact, whileÂ some of EVR's argument wereÂ veryÂ valid <br />  regarding <br />    the irrationalÂ and illogicalÂ methods being followed, <br />  IÂ think that <br />    he did not understand the true scripturesÂ or tenets of <br />Hinduism, <br />    before deciding to take onÂ it. On the other hand, all those <br />four <br />    above andÂ thoseÂ unsung heroes, understoodÂ theÂ  <br />  scriptures than EVR <br />    and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />  withinÂ the <br />    faith. </p>
<p>      So IMHO, the only credit that we canÂ give to EVR is that, he <br />  did <br />    not get converted into another religion. But his argument that one <br />    should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel <br />with <br />    true rationalism.</p>
<p>      And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, well, <br />    then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />  Pillayar <br />    withÂ chappals?Â  If EVR's grudge was against the <br />  discriminating <br />    Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, Brahmins <br />  are <br />    notÂ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process toÂ taking <br />  on <br />    theÂ discriminating Brahmins, heÂ and other fellow atheists <br />  have taken <br />    upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />  cannot <br />    sustain the take. </p>
<p>      So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those who <br />    fought for theÂ social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />  faith.<br />      Â <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh</p>

<p>      Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />  various <br />    other forums. Those who do not have the courage to <br />fightÂ within, <br />  are <br />    those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the <br />  original <br />    one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. NeedlessÂ to <br />say <br />  that <br />    our Politicians today are the standing examples of this Spineless <br />    Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too. </p>
<p>      And do we haveÂ anyone who fought the bias from within the <br />  faith <br />    itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting fromÂ AdhiÂ Sankarar to <br />  Ramanuja to, <br />    until recentlyÂ Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et all.Â There <br />  are also <br />    many lesser known persons, whoÂ have fought a lot from within <br />and <br />  I <br />    bet noneÂ of you will know even such persons existed. These are <br />  the <br />    commonÂ human beings we see day toÂ day, who are silent <br />    revolutionaries.<br />      Â <br />      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh</p>

<p>      Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />      congratulations !! </p>
<p>      My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern <br />  stance <br />    on <br />      making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie <br />  Ravana <br />      is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />      understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana <br />or <br />      Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />      achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to <br />  the <br />      credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style <br />  evil <br />      but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />  liberation <br />      through surrender.</p>
<p>      What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know <br />  about <br />      Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice in <br />  their <br />      own faith as Hindus.

        <p>Vairam, I agree on both points that you have mentioned, that both <br />EVR/Rajaji are leaders in their own right. Also on the right to <br />freedom of religion being a fundamental choice.</p>
<p>I am not a supporter of Varana Dharma, but do you know more than <br />10,000 indigenous arts and crafts died because nobody learnt them, in <br />TN alone that is? It is not right to oppose anything blindly. It <br />makes no sense to argue that EVR fought 'within' or 'without' <br />boundaries of his own faith as he professed not to have any faith. In <br />fact Gandhi's own disagreement with EVR was this 'eye for an eye' <br />approach that refuses to see/acknowledge what is positive on the <br />other side. </p>
<p>Yes freedom of faith is a fundamental right but to exercise it with <br />knowledge and responsibility is not something most people know how to <br />do. The Buddha followed his personal spiritual path, a'la Ramana <br />Mahirishi or Ramakrishna, he did not convert religions nor did he <br />profess hate or dislike of anybody else's faith.</p>
<p>I will surely read those books on Ravana when I find time, love to <br />aly my hands on anything related to the Ramayana if I can!! Also <br />recommended is Paula Richman's Many Ramayanas (available on Amazon).</p>

<blockquote><p>  Vairam,</p>
<p>  Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational based <br />teaching system. He too had faultered here and there. But remember, </p></blockquote>
<p>but for Rajaji and UVS Iyer, the temple entry for all the <br />oppressed would not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />happened now. But I am talking about the initiatives taken by them.</p>
<blockquote><p>  And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for the <br />social cause. I only say that he could not do it while remaining </p></blockquote>
<p>within the faith. As all of us know, his parents and ancestors were <br />all ardent believers of God. So being born into a family of ardent <br />believers, it is just his inability (yes, I would term it as his <br />inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />believer. There can be thousands of reasons given, to explain, why <br />he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he did not <br />have either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage to <br />fight from within.</p>
<blockquote><p>  I am even fine with the fact that he became an atheist. But my <br />upfront question was why to garland the idols with chappals, just </p></blockquote>
<p>to exhibit his atheistic inclinations. And is this act, not similar <br />to what a Bajrang Dal is doing to the churches today. When a <br />Bajrang Dal does this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it is <br />Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<blockquote><p>  This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />Sunnambu". (Please do not mistake me. I am not directing this </p></blockquote>
<p>towards you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />decried in my previous post)</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />league of those who fought for social upliftment while remaining </p></blockquote>
<p>within the fight. And remember, to come out of the faith and fight <br />against it is a very easy, but think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />Sankarar or Ramanuja would have had to face while fighting for the <br />cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />particular. Needless to say that this extends to everyone <br />who fought or, is fighting for the cause of social equality while <br />remaining within the faith. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Why did not the works of Azhwars or Nayanmars, impress EVR. <br />Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of </p></blockquote>
<p>discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in which they mixed <br />no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />the extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate in <br />the name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for <br />this, while others can given ample references from <br />the Nayanmars too. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Simply put, I still say that EVR neither had the knowledge nor <br />the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars or an Adhi Sankarar </p></blockquote>

<p>  Venkatesh,<br />  Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />  very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He also <br />  didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in <br />school <br />  for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader has <br />  +ves and -ves.<br />  So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be included <br />is <br />  not a right argument here.<br />  Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were </p></blockquote>
<p>different but </p>

<p>    Nanda, </p>
<p>    IÂ am surprised that you sayÂ EVR chose to fight, instead of <br />  gettingÂ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />  religion, but he could not stay withinÂ the faith and fight. He <br />did <br />  become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the other <br />  hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS Iyer, <br />all <br />  wereÂ "practising"Â  Hindus, who very muchÂ believed in God <br />and fought <br />  with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>    In fact, whileÂ some of EVR's argument wereÂ veryÂ valid <br />regarding <br />  the irrationalÂ and illogicalÂ methods being followed, <br />IÂ think that <br />  he did not understand the true scripturesÂ or tenets of Hinduism, <br />  before deciding to take onÂ it. On the other hand, all those four <br />  above andÂ thoseÂ unsung heroes, understoodÂ theÂ  <br />scriptures than EVR <br />  and that is what made them fight while still remaining <br />withinÂ the <br />  faith. </p>
<p>    So IMHO, the only credit that we canÂ give to EVR is that, he <br />did <br />  not get converted into another religion. But his argument that one <br />  should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel with <br />  true rationalism.</p>
<p>    And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, well, <br />  then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or <br />Pillayar <br />  withÂ chappals?Â  If EVR's grudge was against the <br />discriminating <br />  Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, Brahmins <br />are <br />  notÂ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process toÂ taking <br />on <br />  theÂ discriminating Brahmins, heÂ and other fellow atheists <br />have taken <br />  upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they <br />cannot <br />  sustain the take. </p>
<p>    So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those who <br />  fought for theÂ social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />faith.<br />    Â <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />various <br />  other forums. Those who do not have the courage to fightÂ within, <br />are <br />  those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the <br />original <br />  one, calling names.

Of course, they have other ulterior motives too. </p>
<p>    And do we haveÂ anyone who fought the bias from within the <br />faith <br />  itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting fromÂ AdhiÂ Sankarar to <br />Ramanuja to, <br />  until recentlyÂ Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et all.Â There <br />are also <br />  many lesser known persons, whoÂ have fought a lot from within and <br />I <br />  bet noneÂ of you will know even such persons existed. These are <br />the <br />  commonÂ human beings we see day toÂ day, who are silent <br />  revolutionaries.<br />    Â <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />    congratulations !! </p>
<p>    My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern <br />stance <br />  on <br />    making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie <br />Ravana <br />    is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />    understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />    Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />    achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to <br />the <br />    credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style <br />evil <br />    but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />liberation <br />    through surrender.</p>
<p>    What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know <br />about <br />    Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice in <br />their <br />    own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps would be <br />to <br />    fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

<p>      His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to mark <br />    victory <br />      of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by <br />  villagers</p>
<p>      of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring out <br />a <br />      procession carrying his idol. </p>
<p>      "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of Dravidian <br />Gaud <br />      tribe and we consider him as our ancestor. We hold a fair on <br />this <br />    day <br />      so that the next generation would remember his sacrifice and <br />    continue <br />      the tradition," said Dhanirao Boddh, Indian Dalit Panther's <br />    President <br />      and one of the organisers of the annual festival on Dussehra. </p>
<p>      In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning effigies <br />    which, <br />      it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>      "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either from <br />      Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />another <br />      member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>      "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />  Ravana's <br />      effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an immediate <br />  ban <br />    on <br />      the practice. </p>
<p>      Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring out <br />a <br />      procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, Gautam <br />    Budh, <br />      Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>      Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be organised <br />  where <br />      Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

<p>        Most of the people who have read Kambaramayana or have heard <br />the <br />      story<br />        of Ramayana in Tamil tend to believe that Ravana was a true <br />    Dravidan<br />        King. That being the case after Dravidian movement many <br />people <br />    felt,<br />        Ravana was wronged and killed by Rama an Aryan King.

<p>I see your point. Even I am not against anyone who is converting to another religion. I am only questioning these methods used in the propaganda. In fact I believe in one Supreme God who is the Master of the Entire Universe. Call Him, Vishnu or Siva or the God said by Jesus or Prophet, they are all one and the same.

<p>Religion is personal right. Every person has right to convert to any <br />religion he wants(provided he is not forced and misguided).<br />I don't agree calling oneself a Hindu,Muslim or Christian just bcos <br />one was born to Hindu,Muslim or Christian parent. Religion is <br />something u got to believe. If some one feels he is more attracted to <br />any other faith he has every right to do it. Thats our constitution- <br />Secular.<br />So it is duty of the government to take care the religious conversion <br />dosen't take place by force or for material benefits.<br />At the same time we as citizens should respect its individual right of <br />any person to preach and try to spread his religion and at the same <br />time, the right of person to convert to another faith. But the catch <br />is, it should be within some limits. I dont like Christians coming <br />into temple or temple region(Tirupati example) to propagate their <br />faith or a activist like bajrang dal who resort to communal <br />violence(to the level of killing people and raping nun in public) to <br />reconvert people of other faith to Hinduism.</p>
<p>What about Guathama Bhudda, one of the greatest human beings ever born <br />in this world. When he had problem with the society around , he went <br />on a journey and he found a religion. It doesnt always mean a person <br />has to fight within his faith. Its a personal choice!</p>
<p>Though at personal level I dont believe in conversion, I dont want to <br />indulge in critizising people who convert for it is a individual <br />right to change faith and I respect that right.</p>

<p>within the faith. As?&#130; all of us know, his parents?&#130; and ancestors were <br />all ardent believers of God.

There can be thousands of?&#130; reasons given, to?&#130; explain, why <br />he chose to become an atheist.

<p>within the fight.?&#130; And remember, to come?&#130; out of the faith and fight <br />against it is a very easy, but?&#130; think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />Sankarar or Ramanuja would have?&#130; had to face while?&#130; fighting for the <br />cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />particular.?&#130; Needless to?&#130; say that this extends to everyone <br />who?&#130; fought or, is fighting for the cause of?&#130; social?&#130; equality while <br />remaining within the faith. </p>

They have outpoured many a songs in which?&#130; they mixed <br />no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />the?&#130; extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate in <br />the?&#130; name of God.

<p>  Venkatesh,<br />  Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />  very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He also <br />  didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in school <br />  for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader has <br />  +ves and -ves.<br />  So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be included is <br />  not a right argument here.<br />  Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />society as much as possible.

<p>different but </p>

<p>    Nanda, </p>
<p>    I?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; am surprised that you say?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; EVR chose to fight, instead of <br />  getting?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />  religion, but he could not stay within?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; the faith and fight. He <br />did <br />  become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the other <br />  hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS Iyer, <br />all <br />  were?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; "practising"?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; Hindus, who very much?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; believed in God <br />and fought <br />  with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>    In fact, while?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; some of EVR's argument were?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; very?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; valid <br />regarding <br />  the irrational?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; and illogical?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; methods being followed, <br />I?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; think that <br />  he did not understand the true scriptures?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; or tenets of Hinduism, <br />  before deciding to take on?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; it. On the other hand, all those four <br />  above and?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; those?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; unsung heroes, understood?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; the?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; <br />scriptures than EVR <br />  and that is what made them fight while still remaining within?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; the <br />  faith. </p>
<p>    So IMHO, the only credit that we can?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; give to EVR is that, he <br />did <br />  not get converted into another religion. But his argument that one <br />  should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel with <br />  true rationalism.</p>
<p>    And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, well, <br />  then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or Pillayar <br />  with?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; chappals??&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; If EVR's grudge was against the discriminating <br />  Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, Brahmins <br />are <br />  not?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process to?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; taking <br />on <br />  the?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; discriminating Brahmins, he?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; and other fellow atheists have <br />taken <br />  upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they cannot <br />  sustain the take. </p>
<p>    So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those who <br />  fought for the?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />faith.<br />    ?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />various <br />  other forums. Those who do not have the courage to fight?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; within, <br />are <br />  those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the original <br />  one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. Needless?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; to say <br />that <br />  our Politicians today are the standing examples of this Spineless <br />  Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too. </p>
<p>    And do we have?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; anyone who fought the bias from within the faith <br />  itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting from?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; Adhi?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; Sankarar to <br />Ramanuja to, <br />  until recently?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et all.?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; There are <br />also <br />  many lesser known persons, who?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; have fought a lot from within and <br />I <br />  bet none?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; of you will know even such persons existed. These are <br />the <br />  common?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; human beings we see day to?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; day, who are silent <br />  revolutionaries.<br />    ?&#131;?&#128;&#154;?&#130; <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />    congratulations !! </p>
<p>    My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance <br />  on <br />    making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie <br />Ravana <br />    is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />    understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />    Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />    achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to <br />the <br />    credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />    but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />liberation <br />    through surrender.</p>
<p>    What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know about <br />    Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice in <br />their <br />    own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps would be to <br />    fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

<p>      In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning effigies <br />    which, <br />      it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>      "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either from <br />      Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />another <br />      member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>      "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />  Ravana's <br />      effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an immediate <br />  ban <br />    on <br />      the practice. </p>
<p>      Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring out a <br />      procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, Gautam <br />    Budh, <br />      Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>      Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be organised <br />  where <br />      Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

        <p>Vairam,</p>
<p>I see your point. Even I am not against anyone who is converting to another religion. I am only questioning these methods used in the propaganda. In fact I believe in one Supreme God who is the Masterof the Entire Universe. Call Him, Vishnu or Siva or the God saidby Jesus or Prophet, they are all one and the same. And do you know who said this. The Azhwars (and Nayanmars too but I dont have the reference of the songs). </p>
<p>I have quoted this before. But am happy to quote it again.</p>
<p>"thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thAnE<br />thamar ugandhadhu eppEr, maRRappEr, thamar ugandhu<br />evvaNNam sindhitthu, imayAdhirupparE!<br />avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm" <br />..............................................................- Poigaiazhwar</p>
<p>"vaNangum thuRaigaL palapalavAkki, madhi vikaRppAl<br />piNangum samayam palapalavAkki, avai avai thoRu<br />aNangum palapalavakki, nin mUrthy parappi vaitthAi,<br />iNangu ninOrai illAi, ninkaN vEtkai ezhuvippanE!"<br />............................................................- Nammazhwar</p>
<p>"..........samayangaL kaNdAn, avai kAppAn......" <br />.............................................................Peyazhwar</p>
<p>and more. These are just examples. And I have also stated elsewhere in our same forum, how, Logically and Rationally the Supreme God as seen by one isthe same, though there may be different name to the religions ascribed today. </p>
<p>Having said this, why should.....<br />1. Some one garland the idols with chappal<br />2. Some one do false propaganda denigrating the God of a particular religion</p>
<p>The 2nd one is what is being done by the Missionaries, with the help of theGovernment and the Media houses, which is what I denounce.</p>
<p>Hope I clarified. My sincere apologies, if my words have hurt you. I only talk about the issue and not the individual.</p>

Every person has right to convert to any <br />religion he wants(provided he is not forced and misguided).<br />I don't agree calling oneself a Hindu,Muslim or Christian just bcos <br />one was born to Hindu,Muslim or Christian parent. Religion is <br />something u got to believe. If some one feels he is more attracted to <br />any other faith he has every right to do it. Thats our constitution- <br />Secular.<br />So it is duty of the government to take care the religious conversion <br />dosen't take place by force or for material benefits.<br />At the same time we as citizens should respect its individual right of <br />any person to preach and try to spread his religion and at the same <br />time, the right of person to convert to another faith. But the catch <br />is, it should be within some limits. I dont like Christians coming <br />into temple or temple region(Tirupati example) to propagate their <br />faith or a activist like bajrang dal who resort to communal <br />violence(to the level of killing people and raping nun in public) to <br />reconvert people of other faith to Hinduism.</p>
<p>What about Guathama Bhudda, one of the greatest human beings ever born <br />in this world. When he had problem with the society around , he went <br />on a journey and he found a religion. It doesnt always mean a person <br />has to fight within his faith. Its a personal choice!</p>
<p>Though at personal level I dont believe in conversion, I dont want to <br />indulge in critizising people who convert for it is a individual <br />right to change faith and I respect that right.</p>

<p>within the faith. AsÂ all of us know, his parentsÂ and ancestors were <br />all ardent believers of God. So being born into aÂ family of ardent <br />believers, it is just his inabilityÂ (yes, I would termÂ it as his <br />inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />believer. There can be thousands ofÂ reasons given, toÂ explain, why <br />he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he didÂ not <br />haveÂ either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage to <br />fight from within.</p>
<blockquote><p>  I amÂ even fine with the fact that heÂ became an atheist. But my <br />upfront question was why toÂ garland the idols with chappals, just </p></blockquote>
<p>toÂ exhibit his atheistic inclinations.Â  And is this act, not similar <br />to whatÂ a Bajrang Dal is doing toÂ the churches today.When a Bajrang <br />Dal doesÂ this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it is <br />Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>

<p>  Venkatesh,<br />  Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />  very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He also <br />  didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in school <br />  for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader has <br />  +ves and -ves.<br />  So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be included is <br />  not a right argument here.<br />  Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />society as much as possible.

<p>    Nanda, </p>
<p>    IÃ‚Â am surprised that you sayÃ‚Â EVR chose to fight, instead of <br />  gettingÃ‚Â converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />  religion, but he could not stay withinÃ‚Â the faith and fight. He <br />did <br />  become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the other <br />  hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS Iyer, <br />all <br />  wereÃ‚Â "practising"Ã‚Â  Hindus, who very muchÃ‚Â believed in God <br />and fought <br />  with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>    In fact, whileÃ‚Â some of EVR's argument wereÃ‚Â veryÃ‚Â valid <br />regarding <br />  the irrationalÃ‚Â and illogicalÃ‚Â methods being followed, <br />IÃ‚Â think that <br />  he did not understand the true scripturesÃ‚Â or tenets of Hinduism, <br />  before deciding to take onÃ‚Â it. On the other hand, all those four <br />  above andÃ‚Â thoseÃ‚Â unsung heroes, understoodÃ‚Â theÃ‚Â  <br />scriptures than EVR <br />  and that is what made them fight while still remaining withinÃ‚Â the <br />  faith. </p>
<p>    So IMHO, the only credit that we canÃ‚Â give to EVR is that, he <br />did <br />  not get converted into another religion. But his argument that one <br />  should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel with <br />  true rationalism.</p>
<p>    And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, well, <br />  then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or Pillayar <br />  withÃ‚Â chappals?Ã‚Â  If EVR's grudge was against the discriminating <br />  Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, Brahmins <br />are <br />  notÃ‚Â Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process toÃ‚Â taking <br />on <br />  theÃ‚Â discriminating Brahmins, heÃ‚Â and other fellow atheists have <br />taken <br />  upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they cannot <br />  sustain the take. </p>
<p>    So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those who <br />  fought for theÃ‚Â social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />faith.<br />    Ã‚Â <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />various <br />  other forums. Those who do not have the courage to fightÃ‚Â within, <br />are <br />  those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the original <br />  one, calling names. These are the worst cowards.

<p>    And do we haveÃ‚Â anyone who fought the bias from within the faith <br />  itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting fromÃ‚Â AdhiÃ‚Â Sankarar to <br />Ramanuja to, <br />  until recentlyÃ‚Â Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer etall.Ã‚Â There are <br />also <br />  many lesser known persons, whoÃ‚Â have fought a lot from within and <br />I <br />  bet noneÃ‚Â of you will know even such persons existed.

<p>    Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />    congratulations !! </p>
<p>    My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance <br />  on <br />    making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie <br />Ravana <br />    is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />    understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />    Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />    achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to <br />the <br />    credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />    but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains <br />liberation <br />    through surrender.</p>
<p>    What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know about <br />    Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice in <br />their <br />    own faith as Hindus.

<p>      His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to mark <br />    victory <br />      of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by <br />  villagers</p>
<p>      of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring out a <br />      procession carrying his idol. </p>
<p>      "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of Dravidian <br />Gaud <br />      tribe and we consider him as our ancestor.

<p>      In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning effigies <br />    which, <br />      it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>      "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either from <br />      Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said <br />another <br />      member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>      "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />  Ravana's <br />      effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an immediate <br />  ban <br />    on <br />      the practice. </p>
<p>      Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring out a <br />      procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, Gautam <br />    Budh, <br />      Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>      Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be organised <br />  where <br />      Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

<p>        Most of the people who have read Kambaramayana or have heard <br />the <br />      story<br />        of Ramayana in Tamil tend to believe that Ravana was a true <br />    Dravidan<br />        King.

<p>      Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in <br />various<br />    other forums. Those who do not have the courage to fight within, <br />are<br />    those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the <br />original<br />    one, calling names.

Of course, they have other ulterior motives too.</p>
<p>      And do we have anyone who fought the bias from within the faith<br />    itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting from Adhi Sankarar to Ramanuja <br />to,<br />    until recently Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et all. There are <br />also<br />    many lesser known persons, who have fought a lot from within and I<br />    bet none of you will know even such persons existed. These are the<br />    common human beings we see day to day, who are silent<br />    revolutionaries.</p>

        <p>Religion is personal right. Every person has right to convert to any <br />religion he wants(provided he is not forced and misguided).<br />I don't agree calling oneself a Hindu,Muslim or Christian just bcos <br />one was born to Hindu,Muslim or Christian parent. Religion is <br />something u got to believe. If some one feels he is more attracted to <br />any other faith he has every right to do it. Thats our constitution- <br />Secular.<br />So it is duty of the government to take care the religious conversion <br />dosen't take place by force or for material benefits.<br />At the same time we as citizens should respect its individual right of <br />any person to preach and try to spread his religion and at the same <br />time, the right of person to convert to another faith. But the catch <br />is, it should be within some limits. I dont like Christians coming <br />into temple or temple region(Tirupati example) to propagate their <br />faith or a activist like bajrang dal who resort to communal <br />violence(to the level of killing people and raping nun in public) to <br />reconvert people of other faith to Hinduism.</p>
<p>What about Guathama Bhudda, one of the greatest human beings ever born <br />in this world. When he had problem with the society around , he went <br />on a journey and he found a religion. It doesnt always mean a person <br />has to fight within his faith. Its a personal choice!</p>
<p>Though at personal level I dont believe in conversion, I dont want to <br />indulge in critizising people who convert for it is a individual <br />right to change faith and I respect that right.</p>

<p>  Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational based <br />teaching system. He too had faultered here and there. But remember, </p></blockquote>
<p>but for Rajaji and UVS Iyer, the temple entry for all the <br />oppressed would not have happened then. Fine that it could have <br />happened now. But I am talking about the initiatives taken by them.</p>
<blockquote><p>  And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for the <br />social cause. I only say that he could not do it while remaining </p></blockquote>
<p>within the faith. As all of us know, his parents and ancestors were <br />all ardent believers of God. So being born into a family of ardent <br />believers, it is just his inability (yes, I would term it as his <br />inability) to fight for the social cause while still remaining a <br />believer. There can be thousands of reasons given, to explain, why <br />he chose to become an atheist. But the final fact is that he did not <br />have either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage to <br />fight from within.</p>
<blockquote><p>  I am even fine with the fact that he became an atheist. But my <br />upfront question was why to garland the idols with chappals, just </p></blockquote>
<p>to exhibit his atheistic inclinations. And is this act, not similar <br />to what a Bajrang Dal is doing to the churches today. When a Bajrang <br />Dal does this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it is <br />Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<blockquote><p>  This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula <br />Sunnambu". (Please do not mistake me. I am not directing this </p></blockquote>
<p>towards you, but the same government and the media houses that I <br />decried in my previous post)</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the <br />league of those who fought for social upliftment while remaining </p></blockquote>
<p>within the fight. And remember, to come out of the faith and fight <br />against it is a very easy, but think of the revolts that an Adhi <br />Sankarar or Ramanuja would have had to face while fighting for the <br />cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in <br />particular. Needless to say that this extends to everyone <br />who fought or, is fighting for the cause of social equality while <br />remaining within the faith. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Why did not the works of Azhwars or Nayanmars, impress EVR. <br />Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of </p></blockquote>
<p>discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in which they mixed <br />no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to <br />the extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate in <br />the name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for this, <br />while others can given ample references from the Nayanmars too. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Simply put, I still say that EVR neither had the knowledge nor the <br />guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars or an Adhi Sankarar or </p></blockquote>

<p>  Venkatesh,<br />  Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />  very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He also <br />  didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in school <br />  for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader has <br />  +ves and -ves.<br />  So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be included is <br />  not a right argument here.<br />  Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the <br />society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were </p></blockquote>
<p>different but </p>

<p>    Nanda, </p>
<p>    IÂ am surprised that you sayÂ EVR chose to fight, instead of <br />  gettingÂ converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another <br />  religion, but he could not stay withinÂ the faith and fight. He <br />did <br />  become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the other <br />  hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS Iyer, <br />all <br />  wereÂ "practising"Â  Hindus, who very muchÂ believed in God <br />and fought <br />  with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>    In fact, whileÂ some of EVR's argument wereÂ veryÂ valid <br />regarding <br />  the irrationalÂ and illogicalÂ methods being followed, <br />IÂ think that <br />  he did not understand the true scripturesÂ or tenets of Hinduism, <br />  before deciding to take onÂ it. On the other hand, all those four <br />  above andÂ thoseÂ unsung heroes, understoodÂ theÂ  <br />scriptures than EVR <br />  and that is what made them fight while still remaining withinÂ the <br />  faith. </p>
<p>    So IMHO, the only credit that we canÂ give to EVR is that, he <br />did <br />  not get converted into another religion. But his argument that one <br />  should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel with <br />  true rationalism.</p>
<p>    And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, well, <br />  then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or Pillayar <br />  withÂ chappals?Â  If EVR's grudge was against the discriminating <br />  Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, Brahmins <br />are <br />  notÂ Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process toÂ taking <br />on <br />  theÂ discriminating Brahmins, heÂ and other fellow atheists have <br />taken <br />  upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they cannot <br />  sustain the take. </p>
<p>    So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those who <br />  fought for theÂ social upliftment, while remaining within the <br />faith.<br />    Â <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    I am surprised that you say EVR chose to fight, instead of<br />  getting converted. Okay, he did not get converted to another<br />  religion, but he could not stay within the faith and fight. He did<br />  become an atheist, to fight, which was not warranted. On the other<br />  hand, the examples of Adhi Sankara, Ramanuja, Rajaji and UVS Iyer, all<br />  were "practising" Hindus, who very much believed in God and fought<br />  with authority, over the misrepresentation of the scriptures.</p>
<p>    In fact, while some of EVR's argument were very valid regarding<br />  the irrational and illogical methods being followed, I think that<br />  he did not understand the true scriptures or tenets of Hinduism,<br />  before deciding to take on it. On the other hand, all those four<br />  above and those unsung heroes, understood the scriptures than EVR<br />  and that is what made them fight while still remaining within the<br />  faith.</p>
<p>    So IMHO, the only credit that we can give to EVR is that, he did<br />  not get converted into another religion. But his argument that one<br />  should become an atheist to condemn some practices doesn't gel with<br />  true rationalism.</p>
<p>    And if one says that Atheism is also accepted by Hinduism, well,<br />  then what was the necessity to garland the idols of Rama or Pillayar<br />  with chappals? If EVR's grudge was against the discriminating<br />  Brahmins, what was necessity to renounce Gods? After all, Brahmins are<br />  not Gods. It is just funny to see that, in process to taking on<br />  the discriminating Brahmins, he and other fellow atheists have taken<br />  upon the God and it is more funny to see that, afterall, they cannot<br />  sustain the take.</p>
<p>    So, personally, I cannot accept EVR in the league of those who<br />  fought for the social upliftment, while remaining within the faith.</p>

<p>    Very Well Said Malathi. This is what I have been shouting in various<br />  other forums. Those who do not have the courage to fight within, are<br />  those who run away from the faith, only to yell back at the original<br />  one, calling names. These are the worst cowards. Needless to say that<br />  our Politicians today are the standing examples of this Spineless<br />  Cowardice. Of course, they have other ulterior motives too.</p>
<p>    And do we have anyone who fought the bias from within the faith<br />  itself. Yes a whole lot. Starting from Adhi Sankarar to Ramanuja to,<br />  until recently Rajaji and UV Swaminatha Iyer et all. There are also<br />  many lesser known persons, who have fought a lot from within and I<br />  bet none of you will know even such persons existed. These are the<br />  common human beings we see day to day, who are silent<br />  revolutionaries.</p>

<p>    Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and<br />    congratulations !!</p>
<p>    My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance<br />  on<br />    making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie Ravana<br />    is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic<br />    understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or<br />    Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and<br />    achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to the<br />    credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil<br />    but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains liberation<br />    through surrender.</p>
<p>    What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know about<br />    Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice in their<br />    own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps would be to<br />    fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

<p>      His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to mark<br />    victory<br />      of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by<br />  villagers</p>
<p>      of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring out a<br />      procession carrying his idol.</p>
<p>      "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of Dravidian Gaud<br />      tribe and we consider him as our ancestor. We hold a fair on this<br />    day<br />      so that the next generation would remember his sacrifice and<br />    continue<br />      the tradition," said Dhanirao Boddh, Indian Dalit Panther's<br />    President<br />      and one of the organisers of the annual festival on Dussehra.</p>
<p>      In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning effigies<br />    which,<br />      it said, causes environmental pollution.</p>
<p>      "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either from<br />      Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said another<br />      member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud.</p>
<p>      "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn<br />  Ravana's<br />      effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an immediate<br />  ban<br />    on<br />      the practice.</p>
<p>      Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring out a<br />      procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, Gautam<br />    Budh,<br />      Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders.</p>
<p>      Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be organised<br />  where<br />      Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

          village which worships ravana....        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Vairam,</p>
<p>Let me clarify. Rajaji is said to have created the vocational based teaching system. He too had faultered here and there. But remember, but for Rajaji and UVS Iyer, the temple entry for all the oppressed would not have happened then. Fine that it could have happened now. But I am talking about the initiatives taken by them.</p>
<p>And more importantly, I did not say that EVR did not fight for the social cause. I only say that he could not do it while remaining within the faith. As all of us know, his parents and ancestors were all ardentbelievers of God. So being born into a family of ardent believers, itis just his inability (yes, I would term it as his inability) tofight for the social cause while still remaining a believer. There can be thousands of reasons given, to explain, why he chose to become anatheist. But the final fact is that he did not have either the knowledge of the true scriptures or the courage to fight from within.</p>
<p>I am even fine with the fact that he became an atheist. But my upfront question was why to garland the idols with chappals, just to exhibit his atheistic inclinations. And is this act, not similar towhat a Bajrang Dal is doing to the churches today. When a Bajrang Dal does this, it is "communal", but if EVR does it, it is Rationalisation and Social Upliftment.</p>
<p>This is what is called as "Oru Kannula Vennai, Oru Kannula Sunnambu". (Please do not mistake me. I am not directing this towards you, but the same government and the media houses that I decried in my previous post)</p>
<p>Hope you now see the reason, why EVR cannot be included in the league of those who fought for social upliftment while remaining within the fight. And remember, to come out of the faith and fight against itis a very easy, but think of the revolts that an Adhi Sankarar or Ramanuja would have had to face while fighting for the cause, still remaining a practising Hindu and a Brahmin in particular. Needless to say that this extends to everyone who fought or, is fighting forthe cause of social equality while remaining within the faith. </p>
<p>Why did not the works of Azhwars or Nayanmars, impress EVR. Afterall they have all decried any social injustice by way of discrimination. They have outpoured many a songs in which they mixed no words in saying that God does not discriminate, while going to the extent of criticizing the Brahmins who actually discriminate in the name of God. I can atleast give references from Azhwars for this, while others can given ample references from the Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>Simply put, I still say that EVR neither had the knowledge nor the guts as that of the Azhwars and Nayanmars or an Adhi Sankarar or Ramanuja to take on the society while remaining with in the faith.<br /> <br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>  Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />  congratulations !! </p>
<p>  My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance <br />on <br />  making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie Ravana <br />  is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />  understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />  Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />  achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to the <br />  credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />  but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains liberation <br />  through surrender.</p>

<p>    His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to mark <br />  victory <br />    of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by <br />villagers</p>
<p>    of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring out a <br />    procession carrying his idol. </p>
<p>    "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of Dravidian Gaud <br />    tribe and we consider him as our ancestor. We hold a fair on this <br />  day <br />    so that the next generation would remember his sacrifice and <br />  continue <br />    the tradition," said Dhanirao Boddh, Indian Dalit Panther's <br />  President <br />    and one of the organisers of the annual festival on Dussehra. </p>
<p>    In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning effigies <br />  which, <br />    it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>    "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either from <br />    Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said another <br />    member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>    "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />Ravana's <br />    effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an immediate <br />ban <br />  on <br />    the practice. </p>
<p>    Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring out a <br />    procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, Gautam <br />  Budh, <br />    Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>    Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be organised <br />where <br />    Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Vairam,</p>
<p>Caveat: This is just a discussion and no offense of any sortmeant.</p>
<p>===========Quote============<br />The country still has <br />oppressors like Bajrang Dal and Hindu Munani activist causing communal <br />and social tensions. <br />==========Unquote===========</p>
<p>On the above, would it be appropriate to call them Oppressors. Please note that I am not their Supporter as well. Since you talk about the situations which would have caused some to turn to Buddhism, the same "situation" lies here. Hope everyone knows clearly regarding what is happening to the Hindus over the period right from the days of Islamin invasion, till date. We can segregate this into 3 types</p>
<p>1. Marauding Islamic Invaders - Who killed a lot of Hindus and the Hindus were helpless here<br />2. The Oppressing English - Ethnic cleansing my demoralising.<br />3. The Missionaries - Who convert by false propaganda and deception. They do it as a business.</p>
<p>Of all the above, the 3rd is the worst. The successive governments, baring a BJP, have supported these missonaries silently. The media is all controlled by people who support these missionaries. Remember, while there was a hue and cry regarding the riots in Karnataka in almost all the media, did any one "known" media house present the reasons behind it, where it all started with the missionaries, giving out pamphletswhich was clearly denigrating the Hindus and their Gods? And recentlyif you have read Thuglak, there was a report of a similar thing that happened in Coimbatore. But the objection was very dignified and no untoward incidents there. But when the Hindus went down to the Police Station to register a complaint, the police refused to take the complaint, but did so, only when they were threatened with a Bandh and Agitation. </p>
<p>So who is forcing all these Bajrang Dals or Hindu Munnanis? Those power-craving politicians who, in the process of Minority Appeasement to garner their votes, turn a blind eye on all these activities. Okay, it would have been better, if the government and media remainedsilent on all that is happening. But when some Hindu organisations come out in support of the oppressed Hindus, then they are termed as "Hindutva Mobs" while, encouraging the other religions' terrorists and deceiving missionaries. </p>
<p>While I do not agree, definitely, with the violent ways of Bajrang Dal, I do want to bring to everyone's kind attention, the utmost biased handling of the Hindus' sentiments of the Government and Media Houses.</p>
<p>While we immediately see a "Breaking News" on a Times Now channel or NDTV when a Muslim or Christian is attacked, why dont we ever see the same Breaking News when the Hindus are attacked? <br />For Example, see the link below and tell me which TV channel, telecasted the news about this happening.<br /><a href="http://www.hindujagruti.org/news/5585.html" title="http://www.hindujagruti.org/news/5585.html">http://www.hindujagruti.org/news/5585.html</a></p>
<p>And surprisingly while a Jihadist reaction by an Islamic terrorist or a denigrating campaign of Hindu Gods by the Christian Missonaries is viewed upon "sympathetically" by the Government and the Media Houses,ascribing the reasons to always the Hindus, the same sympathy is not shown by these two entities on the Hindus, for all the oppressions that they are being subjected to.<br /> <br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>Unfortunately I dont know the psych of the people and It will be <br />highly offensive on my part if I comment whether they are right or <br />wrong without knowing their situations.The country still has <br />oppressors like Bajrang Dal and Hindu Munani activist causing communal <br />and social tensions. I just posted the article to show the wide <br />spread belief of Ravana as Dravidian king was amazed to know the <br />belief even exists in northern part of India.</p>
<blockquote><p>  My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance <br />on <br />  making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie Ravana <br />  is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />  understanding of the epic.<br />Malathi on this, I think you have got the origin of the Theory wrong. </p></blockquote>
<p>I got interesting perspectives from two books namely 'Ravana the great <br />king of Lanka' by M.S.Purnalingam Pillai and 'Brahmin and Non brahmin' <br />by M.S.S.Pandian. Unlike common belief that Ravana the dravidian king <br />theory originated during the Dravidian movement, this theory was <br />actually was made popular by the Tamil Shaivites. Ravana being an <br />ardent Shiva Bhaktha was one of the major reasons for this theory.<br />VJ has given the link for Ravana the great book in this forum. Reading <br />the book would give good insight into this topic. </p>

        <p>Venkatesh,<br />Even Rajaji supported Varana dharma and also introduced the very <br />very un popular vocational training based on their varanas. He also <br />didnt oppose the different treatment(different food system in school <br />for Brahmin children and non Brahmin children). So every leader has <br />+ves and -ves.<br />So arguing that Rajaji can be included and EVR cannot be included is <br />not a right argument here.<br />Both Rajaji and EVR were great leaders and tried to uplift the society as much as possible. The ways which they followed were different but <br />still the motive should be appreciated.<br />I hope we don't argue more on who should be included and who shouldn't <br />be.</p>

<p>  Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />  congratulations !! </p>
<p>  My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance <br />on <br />  making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie Ravana <br />  is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />  understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />  Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />  achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to the <br />  credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />  but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains liberation <br />  through surrender.</p>

<p>    In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning effigies <br />  which, <br />    it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>    "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either from <br />    Pollution Control Board or from the administration, " said another <br />    member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>    "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn <br />Ravana's <br />    effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an immediate <br />ban <br />  on <br />    the practice. </p>
<p>    Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring out a <br />    procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, Gautam <br />  Budh, <br />    Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>    Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be organised <br />where <br />    Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I dont know the psych of the people and It will be <br />highly offensive on my part if I comment whether they are right or <br />wrong without knowing their situations.The country still has <br />oppressors like Bajrang Dal and Hindu Munani activist causing communal <br />and social tensions.

<p>I got interesting perspectives from two books namely 'Ravana the great <br />king of Lanka' by M.S.Purnalingam Pillai and 'Brahmin and Non brahmin' <br />by M.S.S.Pandian. Unlike common belief that Ravana the dravidian king <br />theory originated during the Dravidian movement, this theory was <br />actually was made popular by the Tamil Shaivites. Ravana being an <br />ardent Shiva Bhaktha was one of the major reasons for this theory.<br />VJ has given the link for Ravana the great book in this forum. Reading <br />the book would give good insight into this topic. </p>

<p>  Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />  congratulations !! </p>
<p>  My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance <br />on <br />  making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie Ravana <br />  is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />  understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />  Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />  achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to the <br />  credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />  but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains liberation <br />  through surrender.</p>

So how true <br />is<br />    the Aryan- Dravidian conflict in Ramayana ? Why did Kamban <br />introduce<br />    such conflict of cultures in his work? This essay is intended to <br />  probe<br />    through the two questions and try to present the answer.</p>

        <p>Dear Vairam, very balanced and well researched, thank you and <br />congratulations !! </p>
<p>My only two cents on the second part - the dravidian/modern stance on <br />making a hero out of Ravana is based on my enemy's enemy (ie Ravana <br />is enemy of Brahmin hero Rama) is my friend and not on authentic <br />understanding of the epic. All epic based vilains be it Ravana or <br />Duryodhana or Surapadma are people of great intelligence and <br />achievement who are egoistic to their own destruction. It is to the <br />credit of our culture that we do not believe in satanic style evil <br />but as all evil as created by excessive ego that attains liberation <br />through surrender.</p>
<p>What do all these people who convert to Buddhism really know about <br />Buddhism? They are doing it to spite the bias and prejudice in their <br />own faith as Hindus. A more appropriate stance perhaps would be to <br />fight the bias and prejudice instead of the faith itself.</p>

<p>  His effigies are burnt across the country on Dussehra to mark <br />victory <br />  of good over evil, but the demon king Ravana is revered by villagers</p>
<p>  of Pukhranya in Kanpur who worship him as a hero and bring out a <br />  procession carrying his idol. </p>
<p>  "Ravana was a brave, intelligent and a good king of Dravidian Gaud <br />  tribe and we consider him as our ancestor. We hold a fair on this <br />day <br />  so that the next generation would remember his sacrifice and <br />continue <br />  the tradition," said Dhanirao Boddh, Indian Dalit Panther's <br />President <br />  and one of the organisers of the annual festival on Dussehra. </p>
<p>  In fact, the outfit questions the practice of burning effigies <br />which, <br />  it said, causes environmental pollution. </p>
<p>  "Nobody takes permission to burn Ravana's effigies either from <br />  Pollution Control Board or from the administration," said another <br />  member of the outfit, Genda Prasad Gaud. </p>
<p>  "Law does not permit effigy burning. Then why do they burn Ravana's <br />  effigy to hurt our sentiments," he said, demanding an immediate ban <br />on <br />  the practice. </p>
<p>  Apart from Ravana's idol, the villagers of Pukhranya bring out a <br />  procession with idols of Meghnath, Kumbhkaran, Sambhuk, Gautam <br />Budh, <br />  Ambedkar, King Ashok, Periyar and other dalit leaders. </p>
<p>  Boddh claimed that a a Bodh Deksha ceremony will be organised where <br />  Hindus will adopt Buddhism.</p>
