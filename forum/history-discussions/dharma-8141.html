</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dharma is not impractical. The very word and its roots imply "that which sustains". In the earliest Vedas Dharma was known as 'rta' - that which changes as per cycles. I think the Hindi word 'rithu' is from the same root word.</p>
<p>Dharma is not a monolithic or rigid concept. It changes per place, time andperson. It is just not a philosophical term and neither Absolute.</p>
<p>We Indians are diverse and it would be wrong to expect us to act like a homogeneous entity in all our customs and traditions. The recent the present generation/days we don't feel kinship is because we have cut our chords to our rich historical past that gave us dharma. Instead of people belonging to'Dharma' we have been shone off the great uniting concept. Now we ourselves as a madrasi guy or a hindi girl etc.</p>
<p>I disagree that we are as strange to say a guy from UP as we are strange toa guy from USA. With the UP guy, we share history, we share culture, tradition, dharma that we do not share with the person from USA. </p>
<p>It is indeed sad that we are losing valuable insights on Dharma. We are ourselves to blame.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dharma as a personal concept is a lofty great thing, or even within people who acknowledge one another as community. The problem with presesnt day india is a clear lack of community among people drawn from different parts...dharma or any other philosophy is not practiacl enough to create kinship among say a guy from UP and a guy from Trichy and treat one another as brothers..they are as strangers to one anotehr as an american and an indian who meet first.. and i dont mean elite city folk just those drawn from smaller towns and villages..we may rave about dharma in the practical world there is no kinship created like that that is all.</p>

<p>    Yes as you say most common definition of dharma is one's duty, one's  <br />    personal definitions of right and wrong..the Bhagavad Gita says each  <br />    person has to follow their dharma. To me it is splitting hairs to  <br />    break it any further..and dharma in each time and age differs widely  <br />    and even per person. Dharma seems a far fetched relation to this  <br />    discussion anyways as I saw it - my only point was lack of cultural  <br />    and social integration among people of India, not occasional nice  <br />    encounters.</p>

        <p>Hi Ravi..great explanation..by the way i have been mistaken for a very elderly person many many times when i say i want to talk on Gandhi or Gita at local places. These are just mental images people have, human mind cannot get rid of its images. As long as it is not something particularly bad one has to live with it that is all. </p>

        <p>Hi Arvind,</p>
<p>Am a huge fan of kaviarasar..which song, and line would you be referring to?</p>
<p>Yes as you say most common definition of dharma is one's duty, one's personal definitions of right and wrong..the Bhagavad Gita says each person has to follow their dharma. To me it is splitting hairs to break it any further..and dharma in each time and age differs widely and even per person. Dharma seems a far fetched relation to this discussion anyways as I saw it - my only point was lack of cultural and social integration among people of India, not occasional nice encounters. </p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi,<br />  Today, I saw one of the banners going up inviting the CM towards his  <br />  participation on Annadurai Centenary. Most of the banners on the road  <br />  carried statements of C.N.Annadurai.<br />  This one caught my attention, "Only with reasoning will the masses  <br />  come out of the spell (drunken) of the religion and hence the  <br />  propagation of reasoning is important".<br />  Well Said, To transcend the differences that one has to dwell over and  <br />  with reasoning, the differences blur.<br />  But wouldn't that same apply to the regional, linguistic affinity ( i  <br />  carefully refrain from the use "chauvinism" here). We as a community  <br />  have proclaimed agreement to the statement of "Yaddum Oore Yaavarum  <br />  Keeler" much earlier to "World is flat", do we propagate this message  <br />  enough.<br />  These values were not stated just for economical reasons, the  <br />  statement has lived the ages, but has also seen as many wars or more  <br />  than the years gone by.</p>
<p>  The folks from premier institute migrated to US from India, this   <br />  phenomenon did not attract as much attention over the years, as much  <br />  as it did export of onions in one or two years.<br />  The effects were immediate is my point, not any of this was correct or  <br />  incorrect, nor i do dare to compare the premier institute folks with  <br />  onions.<br />  Which had an impact on us as a country or human race is the question  <br />  that we need to answer, does there lies the Dharma. These answers  <br />  will var￼￼￼￼y with time and period we would answer it. Today,  <br />  it might sound A and tomorrow B, and vary completely differently.</p>
<p>  Hindu law was most specified in Sutras and Dharma was personal (more a  <br />  value system). What is Dharma was always debatable, never conclusive.  <br />  Neither does anyone want, as it evolves.<br />  The paradox of our land is that Sutras became rigid, while Dharma was  <br />  and is fluid. The law even today is not equal, has a basis (not bias)  <br />  on the religion in our land.<br />  Till date we debate Rama to have killed Vaalli was it "Dharma", the  <br />  debate goes on, the lines between law and dharma get smudged most of  <br />  the times - well stated by Kannadasan in Panner Pushpangale Raagam  <br />  paadu (film :Aval Appadi thaan)</p>
<p>  One statement I have heard Koran State ( the folks who have read or  <br />  know about it can reiterate / correct / add) is that the learned  <br />  people have the responsibility of correcting a community, if they fall  <br />  silent, they should not complain and are also punishable.<br />  Bihar is one of the richest state, it is low in literacy, but as a  <br />  country, we can make a difference there. Our complains are at our  <br />  ourselves, let us look who has the will.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,<br />Today, I saw one of the banners going up inviting the CM towards his  <br />participation on Annadurai Centenary. Most of the banners on the road  <br />carried statements of C.N.Annadurai.<br />This one caught my attention, "Only with reasoning will the masses  <br />come out of the spell (drunken) of the religion and hence the  <br />propagation of reasoning is important".<br />Well Said, To transcend the differences that one has to dwell over and  <br />with reasoning, the differences blur.<br />But wouldn't that same apply to the regional, linguistic affinity ( i  <br />carefully refrain from the use "chauvinism" here). We as a community  <br />have proclaimed agreement to the statement of "Yaddum Oore Yaavarum  <br />Keeler" much earlier to "World is flat", do we propagate this message  <br />enough.<br />These values were not stated just for economical reasons, the  <br />statement has lived the ages, but has also seen as many wars or more  <br />than the years gone by.</p>
<p>The folks from premier institute migrated to US from India, this   <br />phenomenon did not attract as much attention over the years, as much  <br />as it did export of onions in one or two years.<br />The effects were immediate is my point, not any of this was correct or  <br />incorrect, nor i do dare to compare the premier institute folks with  <br />onions.<br />Which had an impact on us as a country or human race is the question  <br />that we need to answer, does there lies the Dharma. These answers  <br />will var￼￼￼￼y with time and period we wouldanswer it. Today,  <br />it might sound A and tomorrow B, and vary completely differently.</p>
<p>Hindu law was most specified in Sutras and Dharma was personal (more a  <br />value system). What is Dharma was always debatable, never conclusive.  <br />Neither does anyone want, as it evolves.<br />The paradox of our land is that Sutras became rigid, while Dharma was  <br />and is fluid. The law even today is not equal, has a basis (not bias)  <br />on the religion in our land.<br />Till date we debate Rama to have killed Vaalli was it "Dharma", the  <br />debate goes on, the lines between law and dharma get smudged most of  <br />the times - well stated by Kannadasan in Panner Pushpangale Raagam  <br />paadu (film :Aval Appadi thaan)</p>
<p>One statement I have heard Koran State ( the folks who have read or  <br />know about it can reiterate / correct / add) is that the learned  <br />people have the responsibility of correcting a community, if they fall  <br />silent, they should not complain and are also punishable.<br />Bihar is one of the richest state, it is low in literacy, but as a  <br />country, we can make a difference there. Our complains are at our  <br />ourselves, let us look who has the will.</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards<br />Arvind</p>

<p>  A few years back I wrote about this experience of mine in a dentist's office, in a far away country and how I struck a chord with a Pakistani. You can call it a 'cricket' dharma !! Please read this story and tellme what do you think.</p>
<p>  Best regards,</p>
<p>  TMS</p>
<p>  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>   <br />  The lady hygienist in the dentist's office ushered me to a reclining chair and said that I should wait for the dentist to come. In that natural posture of relaxation I closed my eyes and almost took a nap when a gentle voice woke me up from behind. "I'm Faz and how are you Tim?" He must have read my name from my file I thought. I noticed a labored American accent. Not able to see the face, I was trying to make a guess as to the strange first name's nationality. Was the name 'Fuzz' or 'Fas' I debated but in this country of immigrants it could belong to any nationality, I thought, not failing to note the familiarity in his accent.  He continued his talk with thehygienist about the X-rays. I was getting closer and closer to his accent before I said to myself "Munda punjabi di?" (Is the boy from Punjab?)<br />   <br />  He did come back to me finally and smiled. He said tooth number 32 had tobe removed otherwise everything was 'fit' ??" another typical Punjabi expression, I thought. The dentist was tall, lanky and of light skin tone, someone who could easily pass for a Portuguese. As if he had read my mind, he asked me if I was from India. I said yes and raised my eye brows. He smiled and said, "I'm from Pakistan and when I saw your last name I knew you are from India." To that, I replied when I heard his first name I thought hewas from Ukraine. "Fazal Ahmed," he clarified and laughed at the possibility of being mistaken for a Ukrainian. At last it made sense. We both realized we had camouflaged our identities with our respective adopted first names.<br />   <br />  He is from Lahore, the cultural capital of Pakistan. I pointed out to himthat the ritzy Punjabis on both sides of the border speak in a similar inflection. He was amused with my observation. He had heard of the phrase "India is shining" and wanted to know if that was true. I stayed politically correct and talked about outsourcing, software exports and the changes all around. He said he would like to visit India some day.<br />   <br />  After some more small talk, the inevitable subject surfaced, "I'm surprised India lost to Pakistan by 341 runs in the final test at Karachi," he said; his voice could not hide some of his excitement. I said our best batsmencollapse under pressure and he acknowledged that Pakistanis were no different. He was sad that Ganguly was not treated properly and wondered if Sachin Tendulkar's days as a dependable batsman were over. I told him that the one day series would go in India's favor to which he replied he hoped so butwas sure that Pakistan would win. The last sentence he spoke in Urdu. I replied in Hindi that changes were inevitable.<br />   <br />  We talked about the good old days of cricket ??" Sunil Gavaskar, Javed Miandad, and the legendary Hanif Mohammad. We even wistfully talked abouthow formidable a combined team of our two nations would be.<br />  When I left the clinic, I felt my cricket repertoire was fully refurbished. In Red Sox nation where one can't be anything but a baseball fan, only ahandful can talk about cricket as passionately.<br />   <br />  Weeks later the 'oneday limited overs' matches went in India's favor. The results were amazing. Indian cricketer, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, became the heart throb of millions of Pakistanis. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf openly praised the young Indian team's talent. There was magic in the air when the teams played and Indians won repeatedly in four matches, the only occasion when they lost was on a technical formula. Even the lay Pakistani person seemed to enjoy the Indian victory.<br />   <br />  Soon enough, I planned to go and meet Faz and swagger about my prophecieshaving come true. I knew he would agree with me and say something in his distinct Punjabi accent.<br />   <br />  Except on cricket grounds, hockey fields, the Line of Control and Siachenglacier, Indians and Pakistanis seem to get along just fine.</p>

        <p>Hi VJ, no my point was why is travelling in various parts of india like going to a foreign country - Europe as you say? If it is our country it shouldbe easier right? We think it is language..well lot of indians who know hindi still have problems in northern india..and one cannot be expected to learn 20+ languages for travellling in one country.</p>
<p>GRS and TMs talk of the occasional pleasant travel experience which happenseverywhere. You realize someone knows or has something with you in common that crosses cultural, language, national barriers and that is undeniably avery pleasant experience. Getting along in another state is a lot more complex than that. The primary reason is lack of acceptance among fellow indians and poor general knowledge of other states. New York City for exampel has a huge mix of various indians across the country. There are tamil groups,kannada groups, north indian groups...everything..rarely one indian group where people know and support one another. That is our problem, just assumign the occasional pleasant encounter solves all that is incorrect.</p>
<p>Will stop the thread here.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>  I dont think you are comparing apples to apples. You are talking of america<br />  where you have an advantage with common language. which is not the case when<br />  traveling 500 kms anywhere in india. the diversity of the land is well know.<br />  But take the case when you travel in europe - all the name boards and<br />  annoucnements, tickets are in french, italian,german mostly - and its tough<br />  to get along even with good english. and talking of cricket and english -it<br />  took me about 6 months to understand what ponting was saying !!!</p>

<p>    My 'frustrations' are not just about Bihar, it is about various parts of<br />    India, you dont' have to go that far..even AP or interior Karnataka..pure<br />    logistics. If you are travelling interior and need directions God help<br />    you..and nowadays with increasing politics if you are tamil and they figured<br />    out you are in rural Karnataka again God help you...and what is the general<br />    knowledge of how the country is among people of other cultures..majority<br />    north indians still think of us as one 'madras' state who have dark<br />    complexion and eat idlies..</p>
<p>    Yes when you are in comfortable surroundings and hte other guy is friendly<br />    like your punjabi mumda you can strike up a conversation..like a told GRS<br />    that is possible with anyone, not just an Indian. With lot of white<br />    americans i have had very surprising talks like that, out of the blue they<br />    would ask me stuff i never thought they knew..like one white lady whilei<br />    was in a train came up and asked me if I knew carnatic music..she happened<br />    to be a disciple of someone and was a regular at chennai music festivals.for<br />    the next two hours we had the most incredible conversation on carnatic<br />    musicians.</p>
<p>    The point is just what do we have in common with another indian that make<br />    it easier than any stranger to talk to or be community? Why is it<br />    logistically so difficult to go from one part of the country to another?<br />    Until all these are resolved our unity is just an emotional feeling that is<br />    all.</p>

Indian cricketer, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, became the<br />    heart throb of millions of Pakistanis. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf<br />    openly praised the young Indian team's talent. There was magic in the air<br />    when the teams played and Indians won repeatedly in four matches, the only<br />    occasion when they lost was on a technical formula. Even the lay Pakistani<br />    person seemed to enjoy the Indian victory.<br />      ?<br />      Soon enough, I planned to go and meet Faz and swagger about my prophecies<br />    having come true. I knew he would agree with me and say something in his<br />    distinct Punjabi accent.<br />      ?<br />      Except on cricket grounds, hockey fields, the Line of Control and Siachen<br />    glacier, Indians and Pakistanis seem to get along just fine.</p>

        <p>Dear Sundar:<br />I once knew a Pakistani co-worker. He talked to me what appeared in Hindi, but it was Urudu. And I had always talked to him in Hindi. In the land of milk and honey, for some reason there was a sense of "oneness" - he hung outwith us Indians.</p>
<p>And in our current team there are Pakistanis - who will get into talking with me in Urdu/Hindi. I remember a Pakistani who used to tell if only the region was not divided, how we would have whopped the *<acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  of the World :-)</p>
<p>I have positive experiences with Bangaladeshis as well. Just the very thought of coming from the same region in an alien setting draws us together.</p>
<p>I had nice experiences in Alaska. We were touring Alaska; and as we were walking in the downtown of Anchorage a Sardarji elder stops us, inquires fromwhere we were. Then hugged me physically and volunteered to spend some of his time taking us around Anchorage. We politely refused. Earlier that day,we were walking to our parked car - which was at quite a distance from where we were. A car goes past us, stops and then comes in reverse. The windowrolls down and a cheerful face pokes out and offers us a lift. The person driving the car was a person of Andhra origin and a Christian Priest. Both folks belonged to different religions and probably had moved to Alaska quite earlier. They still had the affection towards maatrubhoomi.</p>
<p>If we want we can always find differences or similarities. It all lies in our head.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Malathi-</p>
<p>  I am not an expert on the theory of  Dharma, but I do feel that yourconculsion of a lost Indian 'cause' stemming from frustrations in Bihar could be well misplaced. It is true that  Bihar could be insanely frustrating on a any given day and my sympathies are with you for all you went through, but not so much to doubt our country, its union, constitution and civilization !  South or North we Indians can find many common grounds to interact, communicate and make fun of each other.. one such common topic is cricket ! </p>
<p>  A few years back I wrote about this experience of mine in a dentist's office, in a far away country and how I struck a chord with a Pakistani. You can call it a 'cricket' dharma !! Please read this story and tellme what do you think.</p>
<p>  Best regards,</p>
<p>  TMS</p>
<p>  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>   <br />  The lady hygienist in the dentist's office ushered me to a reclining chair and said that I should wait for the dentist to come. In that natural posture of relaxation I closed my eyes and almost took a nap when a gentle voice woke me up from behind. "I'm Faz and how are you Tim?" He must have read my name from my file I thought. I noticed a labored American accent. Not able to see the face, I was trying to make a guess as to the strange first name's nationality. Was the name 'Fuzz' or 'Fas' I debated but in this country of immigrants it could belong to any nationality, I thought, not failing to note the familiarity in his accent.  He continued his talk with thehygienist about the X-rays. I was getting closer and closer to his accent before I said to myself "Munda punjabi di?" (Is the boy from Punjab?)<br />   <br />  He did come back to me finally and smiled. He said tooth number 32 had tobe removed otherwise everything was 'fit' ??" another typical Punjabi expression, I thought. The dentist was tall, lanky and of light skin tone, someone who could easily pass for a Portuguese. As if he had read my mind, he asked me if I was from India. I said yes and raised my eye brows. He smiled and said, "I'm from Pakistan and when I saw your last name I knew you are from India." To that, I replied when I heard his first name I thought hewas from Ukraine. "Fazal Ahmed," he clarified and laughed at the possibility of being mistaken for a Ukrainian. At last it made sense. We both realized we had camouflaged our identities with our respective adopted first names.<br />   <br />  He is from Lahore, the cultural capital of Pakistan. I pointed out to himthat the ritzy Punjabis on both sides of the border speak in a similar inflection. He was amused with my observation. He had heard of the phrase "India is shining" and wanted to know if that was true. I stayed politically correct and talked about outsourcing, software exports and the changes all around. He said he would like to visit India some day.<br />   <br />  After some more small talk, the inevitable subject surfaced, "I'm surprised India lost to Pakistan by 341 runs in the final test at Karachi," he said; his voice could not hide some of his excitement. I said our best batsmencollapse under pressure and he acknowledged that Pakistanis were no different. He was sad that Ganguly was not treated properly and wondered if Sachin Tendulkar's days as a dependable batsman were over. I told him that the one day series would go in India's favor to which he replied he hoped so butwas sure that Pakistan would win. The last sentence he spoke in Urdu. I replied in Hindi that changes were inevitable.<br />   <br />  We talked about the good old days of cricket ??" Sunil Gavaskar, Javed Miandad, and the legendary Hanif Mohammad. We even wistfully talked abouthow formidable a combined team of our two nations would be.<br />  When I left the clinic, I felt my cricket repertoire was fully refurbished. In Red Sox nation where one can't be anything but a baseball fan, only ahandful can talk about cricket as passionately.<br />   <br />  Weeks later the 'oneday limited overs' matches went in India's favor. The results were amazing. Indian cricketer, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, became the heart throb of millions of Pakistanis. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf openly praised the young Indian team's talent. There was magic in the air when the teams played and Indians won repeatedly in four matches, the only occasion when they lost was on a technical formula. Even the lay Pakistani person seemed to enjoy the Indian victory.<br />   <br />  Soon enough, I planned to go and meet Faz and swagger about my prophecieshaving come true. I knew he would agree with me and say something in his distinct Punjabi accent.<br />   <br />  Except on cricket grounds, hockey fields, the Line of Control and Siachenglacier, Indians and Pakistanis seem to get along just fine.</p>

<p>"If you are travelling interior and need directions God help you"</p>
<p>I dont think you are comparing apples to apples. You are talking of america<br />where you have an advantage with common language. which is not the case when<br />traveling 500 kms anywhere in india. the diversity of the land is well know.<br />But take the case when you travel in europe - all the name boards and<br />annoucnements, tickets are in french, italian,german mostly - and its tough<br />to get along even with good english. and talking of cricket and english - it<br />took me about 6 months to understand what ponting was saying !!!</p>

<p>  My 'frustrations' are not just about Bihar, it is about various parts of<br />  India, you dont' have to go that far..even AP or interior Karnataka..pure<br />  logistics. If you are travelling interior and need directions God help<br />  you..and nowadays with increasing politics if you are tamil and they figured<br />  out you are in rural Karnataka again God help you...and what is the general<br />  knowledge of how the country is among people of other cultures..majority<br />  north indians still think of us as one 'madras' state who have dark<br />  complexion and eat idlies..</p>
<p>  Yes when you are in comfortable surroundings and hte other guy is friendly<br />  like your punjabi mumda you can strike up a conversation..like a told GRS<br />  that is possible with anyone, not just an Indian. With lot of white<br />  americans i have had very surprising talks like that, out of the blue they<br />  would ask me stuff i never thought they knew..like one white lady while i<br />  was in a train came up and asked me if I knew carnatic music..she happened<br />  to be a disciple of someone and was a regular at chennai music festivals.for<br />  the next two hours we had the most incredible conversation on carnatic<br />  musicians.</p>
<p>  The point is just what do we have in common with another indian that make<br />  it easier than any stranger to talk to or be community? Why is it<br />  logistically so difficult to go from one part of the country to another?<br />  Until all these are resolved our unity is just an emotional feeling that is<br />  all.</p>

<p>    ?<br />    The lady hygienist in the dentist's office ushered me to a reclining<br />  chair and said that I should wait for the dentist to come.

The dentist was tall, lanky and of light skin tone,<br />  someone who could easily pass for a Portuguese. As if he had read my mind,<br />  he asked me if I was from India. I said yes and raised my eye brows. He<br />  smiled and said, "I'm from Pakistan and when I saw your last name I knew you<br />  are from India."

<p>  My point is we have the concept of Dharma, and after freedom we chose to not go by it but adopted a totally Western mode of government. So we cut our strings in the first place. Have you seen a beetroot with long stems and leaves sprouting from it? Or how Cauliflower florets are attached to one another and to a central stem? It is like them, once having cut them separately there is no connection.</p>

<p>    Hi GRS, I think the conversation is going on two parellel lines...the philosphical definitions of dharma and kinship among fellow indians.</p>
<p>    We can argue at length on the former. The latter in my personal experience and that of others is difficult practically among people from various parts of the country that is all. Fellow tamils have more in common than differences. Fellow northies don't. In terms of dharma every human has things in common. You can strike up conversations even with a foreigner based on something you have in common. If it is a fellow indian in my opinion it should be easier. And it is not. Even travel to other parts of the country is not in any way easy than travel to a foreign land. Rather than revel in diversity we have to see what is wrong with this and can it be corrected if at all. </p>

        <p>It is going in two parallel lines, because you don't want them to meet :-))))</p>
<p>My point is we have the concept of Dharma, and after freedom we chose to not go by it but adopted a totally Western mode of government. So we cut our strings in the first place. Have you seen a beetroot with long stems and leaves sprouting from it? Or how Cauliflower florets are attached to one another and to a central stem? It is like them, once having cut them separatelythere is no connection.</p>
<p>If one person is more easy with a foreigner than an Indian, I can not help it.</p>

<p>  We can argue at length on the former. The latter in my personal experience and that of others is difficult practically among people from various parts of the country that is all. Fellow tamils have more in common than differences. Fellow northies don't. In terms of dharma every human has things incommon. You can strike up conversations even with a foreigner based on something you have in common. If it is a fellow indian in my opinion it shouldbe easier. And it is not.

          Dharma        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>GRS, dharma is righteousness - every individual has a dharma, it is very simply what you believe is right and adharma is wrong. People from same country, same culture have similar dharms, similar ideas of right and wrong. Forexample in hindu dharma one takes care of one's parents at home. It is accepted as our dharma across the country. That is one example.</p>
<p>My point however was that these dharmic ideals do not help very much in finding kinship with fellow indians. It is not about what 'we' can do, there is no 'we' just different ways of perceiving. The average small town north indian regards staple food as dhal roti, he expects every other fellow indian to know hindi, his idea of movie stars by far is limited to Bachhan and Shahrukh Khan and temple worship is porceilain dolls with no specifities. The average south indian has some idea of dhal roti and shahrukh khan but totally different preferences otherwise. Putting these two people in a room isnot that different from being with a foreigner in the same room. This is apractical truth. And even more practical the average south indian may be awhole lot more comfortable in Texas or Milwaukee than in UP or Bihar. Justtry it and see. I have been on the streets of Bihar with family before, I could have been in Africa, it was so alien and so difficult.</p>
<p>Just some realities that is all.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dharma is not impractical. The very word and its roots imply "that which sustains". In the earliest Vedas Dharma was known as 'rta' - that which changes as per cycles. I think the Hindi word 'rithu' is from the same root word.</p>
<p>  Dharma is not a monolithic or rigid concept. It changes per place, time and person. It is just not a philosophical term and neither Absolute.</p>
<p>  We Indians are diverse and it would be wrong to expect us to act like a homogeneous entity in all our customs and traditions. The recent the presentgeneration/days we don't feel kinship is because we have cut our chords toour rich historical past that gave us dharma. Instead of people belonging to 'Dharma' we have been shone off the great uniting concept. Now we ourselves as a madrasi guy or a hindi girl etc.</p>
<p>  I disagree that we are as strange to say a guy from UP as we are strange to a guy from USA. With the UP guy, we share history, we share culture, tradition, dharma that we do not share with the person from USA. </p>
<p>  It is indeed sad that we are losing valuable insights on Dharma. We are ourselves to blame.</p>

<p>    Dharma as a personal concept is a lofty great thing, or even within people who acknowledge one another as community. The problem with presesnt dayindia is a clear lack of community among people drawn from different parts...dharma or any other philosophy is not practiacl enough to create kinshipamong say a guy from UP and a guy from Trichy and treat one another as brothers..they are as strangers to one anotehr as an american and an indian who meet first.. and i dont mean elite city folk just those drawn from smaller towns and villages..we may rave about dharma in the practical world thereis no kinship created like that that is all.</p></dmaloo@></p></blockquote>
