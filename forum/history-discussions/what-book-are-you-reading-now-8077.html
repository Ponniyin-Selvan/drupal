<p>i think this question should be asked once in a few months to kindle interest in reading.<br />and that too opportunities to read a different genre of book can be generated</p>
<p>I am reading two books now. <br />CARNATIC SUMMER by v . sriram who participated as a guest in our open house. its about 20 great carnatic musicians. to my surprise my family was mentioned in the second page regarding the article on ariyakudi ramanuja iyengar.</p>
<p>also reading<br />AGATHA CHRITIE- the finished portrait<br />this is about one of my favourite authors.mystery writer agatha christie vanished from her home and was missing for 11 days. this book is a full scaleresearch on what may have happened during that period.</p>
<p>please let us all know what you are reading.</p>

<p>  <br />Hi</p>
<p>iam quite interested in early years of churchill in india.<br />reportedly there is a club there which has records of his unpaid bills.</p>
<p>could somebody recommend a book on this.</p>
<p>one of the very few politicians of the world to get a nobel for literature(kennedy got a pulitzer)<br />churchill used to stutter or have a lisp and overcame it to become one of the greatest orators of all time(the Stuttering Foundation of America uses Churchill, pictured on its home page, as one of its role models of successful stutterers)</p>
<p>… we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.</p>
<p>one humorist hearing this speech reportedly remarked " what a fine description . it sounds so much like our family holiday"</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>i am quite interested in early years of churchill in india.<br />reportedly there is a club there which has records of his unpaid bills.</p>
<p>could somebody recommend a book on this.</p>
<p>one of the very few politicians of the world to get a nobel for literature(kennedy got a pulitzer)<br />churchill used to stutter or have a lisp and overcame it to become one of the greatest orators of all time(the Stuttering Foundation of America uses Churchill, pictured on its home page, as one of its role models of successful stutterers)</p>
<p>? we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight on the beaches,we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and inthe streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.</p>
<p>one humorist hearing this speech reportedly remarked " what a fine description . it sounds so much like our family holiday"</p>

<p>              from the wiki</p>
<p>              During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of<br />        being<br />            a collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir),<br />            and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He<br />            claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation,<br />        like a<br />            plumber or carpenter.<br />              After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself<br />            believed that the future of the West could depend on the New<br />        Order.<br />            For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order<br />            brought new hope. In light of everything which has happened, itis<br />            of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New<br />            Order"[23]. The Tintin character was never depicted as adheringto<br />            these beliefs. However, it has been argued that anti-Semitic<br />        themes<br />            continued, especially in the post-war Flight 714.[24]</p>

<p>                    I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin<br />            Tin is simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson<br />        and<br />            Thompson, the detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>                    French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix<br />            cartoons, the pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized<br />            friend. The stories are about Gauls hating and bashing Romans<br />        ( set<br />            in 2 BC) with the help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>                    I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and<br />            Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of<br />            British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian<br />            Fleming , Anne Perry to name the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>

<p>                    Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with<br />            Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes<br />        close<br />            to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot<br />            beat that).

<p>                     My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has<br />            slowly transferred to silver screen adaptations. .given limited<br />            time. The BBC series on both are amazing and have seen them a few<br />            hundred times.</p>

Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I<br />        luv<br />            to read tintin<br />                         comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite<br />            characters - both invite<br />                         trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired<br />        me<br />            to read other books<br />                         to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in<br />            easy English series too.<br />                         I always wanted to own the entire collection of<br />        tintin;             but managed to get<br />                         5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of<br />        tintin<br />            and have them in my<br />                         Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the<br />            entire set of tintin<br />                         books :))</p>
<p>                         Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never<br />        got<br />            quite fantacised by<br />                         it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>                         Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi<br />            was a character I loved<br />                         to read.

To<br />        understand it<br />            better you have to<br />                            read her school books, Malory Towers and St<br />        Clares -<br />            almost all the<br />                            children from other countries France, America,<br />            Africa and so on are<br />                            caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect<br />            British stereotypes. Of<br />                            course Asian kids dont even deserve mention ,<br />        there<br />            is one adventure<br />                            book where there is an exotic brown guy magician<br />            named Uma. That is as<br />                            far as she came as far as asians go. None of the<br />            girls have any careers,<br />                            all of them grow up to be idealistic church going<br />            wives and mothers and<br />                            boys have to protect and guard girls all the time.<br />            Of course all that is<br />                            British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                            The Noddy series was edited to remove racist<br />            references about a few<br />                            years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in<br />            most of the States,<br />                            France and Germany too - but given our own<br />        colonial<br />            history we did not<br />                            find it objectionable but most people from other<br />            countries do.</p>
<p>                            Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of<br />            originality, short<br />                            sentence construction and repeat usage of themes.<br />            The point also is that<br />                            she was creative and appealed to the escapist<br />            stories children love so<br />                            very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from<br />            childhood i browse now<br />                            and then and smile at the humor and memories they<br />            bring. There was a<br />                            time when I thought these were classics but that<br />        is<br />            no longer there.</p>

<p>            herge a nazi?</p>
<p>            from the wiki</p>
<p>            During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of<br />      being<br />          a collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir),<br />          and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He<br />          claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation,<br />      like a<br />          plumber or carpenter.<br />            After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself<br />          believed that the future of the West could depend on the New<br />      Order.<br />          For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order<br />          brought new hope. In light of everything which has happened, it is<br />          of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New<br />          Order"[23]. The Tintin character was never depicted as adhering to<br />          these beliefs. However, it has been argued that anti-Semitic<br />      themes<br />          continued, especially in the post-war Flight 714.[24]</p>

<p>                  I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin<br />          Tin is simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson<br />      and<br />          Thompson, the detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>                  French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix<br />          cartoons, the pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized<br />          friend. The stories are about Gauls hating and bashing Romans<br />      ( set<br />          in 2 BC) with the help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>                  I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and<br />          Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of<br />          British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian<br />          Fleming , Anne Perry to name the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>

<p>                  Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with<br />          Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes<br />      close<br />          to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot<br />          beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the<br />          current list at hand.</p>

<p>                   I have the whole new collection, set of 3s..also two<br />          supplementary books detailing the history of tintin books and the<br />          art work which has enhanced over the years. (The original tintin<br />          artwork is somewhat like the originial mickey mouse..very bare<br />          bones..).</p>
<p>                   My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has<br />          slowly transferred to silver screen adaptations. .given limited<br />          time. The BBC series on both are amazing and have seen them a few<br />          hundred times.</p>

<p>                       It never occurred to me we could have fans of<br />      tintin in<br />          a fans' club of<br />                       kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I<br />      luv<br />          to read tintin<br />                       comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite<br />          characters - both invite<br />                       trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired<br />      me<br />          to read other books<br />                       to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in<br />          easy English series too.<br />                       I always wanted to own the entire collection of<br />      tintin;           but managed to get<br />                       5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of<br />      tintin<br />          and have them in my<br />                       Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the<br />          entire set of tintin<br />                       books :))</p>
<p>                       Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never<br />      got<br />          quite fantacised by<br />                       it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>                       Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi<br />          was a character I loved<br />                       to read. But I recently read a rani comics and<br />      found it<br />          too trivial - may be<br />                       I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>                       Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>                       Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme<br />      thinkers<br />          might think so but<br />                       overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all<br />      over<br />          the world and is<br />                       considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving<br />          character to win the<br />                       World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole<br />      fan<br />          clubs, hotels and<br />                       memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>                       I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if<br />          other Tintin fans are<br />                       there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite<br />          Tintin - mine is the<br />                       Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                          Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist<br />      but<br />          no different from<br />                          attitudes and writings of her time. To<br />      understand it<br />          better you have to<br />                          read her school books, Malory Towers and St<br />      Clares -<br />          almost all the<br />                          children from other countries France, America,<br />          Africa and so on are<br />                          caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect<br />          British stereotypes. Of<br />                          course Asian kids dont even deserve mention ,<br />      there<br />          is one adventure<br />                          book where there is an exotic brown guy magician<br />          named Uma. That is as<br />                          far as she came as far as asians go. None of the<br />          girls have any careers,<br />                          all of them grow up to be idealistic church going<br />          wives and mothers and<br />                          boys have to protect and guard girls all the time.<br />          Of course all that is<br />                          British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                          The Noddy series was edited to remove racist<br />          references about a few<br />                          years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in<br />          most of the States,<br />                          France and Germany too - but given our own<br />      colonial<br />          history we did not<br />                          find it objectionable but most people from other<br />          countries do.</p>
<p>                          Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of<br />          originality, short<br />                          sentence construction and repeat usage of themes.<br />          The point also is that<br />                          she was creative and appealed to the escapist<br />          stories children love so<br />                          very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from<br />          childhood i browse now<br />                          and then and smile at the humor and memories they<br />          bring. There was a<br />                          time when I thought these were classics but that<br />      is<br />          no longer there.</p>

<p>          herge a nazi?</p>
<p>          from the wiki</p>
<p>          During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of  <br />    being<br />        a collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir),<br />        and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He<br />        claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation,  <br />    like a<br />        plumber or carpenter.<br />          After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself<br />        believed that the future of the West could depend on the New  <br />    Order.<br />        For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order<br />        brought new hope. In light of everything which has happened, it is<br />        of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New<br />        Order"[23]. The Tintin character was never depicted as adhering to<br />        these beliefs. However, it has been argued that anti-Semitic  <br />    themes<br />        continued, especially in the post-war Flight 714.[24]</p>

<p>            Wow, didn't know that..who thought Herge was Nazi, the French?</p>
<p>            My favorite is Thomson and Thompson too..the scene where they<br />        grow green beards and hiccup..priceless. .and the scene where<br />        Captain Haddock circles the moon (The moon has a new satelli named<br />        HAddock :)) Wow and Professor Calculus 'acting the goat'..I will<br />        never forget how i lent one copy of Tintin to my retired uncle -<br />        over 70 and never read much...he read one and was laughing so loud<br />        till the house was echoeing and the older women were clueless what<br />        was going on..Humor unites people in odd ways :))</p>

<p>                I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin<br />        Tin is simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson  <br />    and<br />        Thompson, the detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>                French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix<br />        cartoons, the pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized<br />        friend. The stories are about Gauls hating and bashing Romans  <br />    ( set<br />        in 2 BC) with the help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>                I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and<br />        Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of<br />        British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian<br />        Fleming , Anne Perry to name the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>                Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success'<br />        Raising the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold  <br />    in<br />        millions throughout the US and the challenges he faced building  <br />    the<br />        company virtually from his garage to an independent corporate.  <br />    Great<br />        story.</p>

<p>                Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with<br />        Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes  <br />    close<br />        to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot<br />        beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the<br />        current list at hand.</p>

<p>                 My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has<br />        slowly transferred to silver screen adaptations. .given limited<br />        time. The BBC series on both are amazing and have seen them a few<br />        hundred times.</p>

<p>                     It never occurred to me we could have fans of  <br />    tintin in<br />        a fans' club of<br />                     kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I  <br />    luv<br />        to read tintin<br />                     comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite<br />        characters - both invite<br />                     trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired  <br />    me<br />        to read other books<br />                     to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in<br />        easy English series too.<br />                     I always wanted to own the entire collection of  <br />    tintin;         but managed to get<br />                     5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of  <br />    tintin<br />        and have them in my<br />                     Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the<br />        entire set of tintin<br />                     books :))</p>
<p>                     Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never  <br />    got<br />        quite fantacised by<br />                     it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>                     Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi<br />        was a character I loved<br />                     to read. But I recently read a rani comics and  <br />    found it<br />        too trivial - may be<br />                     I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>                     Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme  <br />    thinkers<br />        might think so but<br />                     overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all  <br />    over<br />        the world and is<br />                     considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving<br />        character to win the<br />                     World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole  <br />    fan<br />        clubs, hotels and<br />                     memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>                     I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if<br />        other Tintin fans are<br />                     there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite<br />        Tintin - mine is the<br />                     Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                        Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist  <br />    but<br />        no different from<br />                        attitudes and writings of her time. To  <br />    understand it<br />        better you have to<br />                        read her school books, Malory Towers and St  <br />    Clares -<br />        almost all the<br />                        children from other countries France, America,<br />        Africa and so on are<br />                        caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect<br />        British stereotypes. Of<br />                        course Asian kids dont even deserve mention ,  <br />    there<br />        is one adventure<br />                        book where there is an exotic brown guy magician<br />        named Uma. That is as<br />                        far as she came as far as asians go. None of the<br />        girls have any careers,<br />                        all of them grow up to be idealistic church going<br />        wives and mothers and<br />                        boys have to protect and guard girls all the time.<br />        Of course all that is<br />                        British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                        The Noddy series was edited to remove racist<br />        references about a few<br />                        years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in<br />        most of the States,<br />                        France and Germany too - but given our own  <br />    colonial<br />        history we did not<br />                        find it objectionable but most people from other<br />        countries do.</p>
<p>                        Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of<br />        originality, short<br />                        sentence construction and repeat usage of themes.<br />        The point also is that<br />                        she was creative and appealed to the escapist<br />        stories children love so<br />                        very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from<br />        childhood i browse now<br />                        and then and smile at the humor and memories they<br />        bring. There was a<br />                        time when I thought these were classics but that  <br />    is<br />        no longer there.</p>

<p>        herge a nazi?</p>
<p>        from the wiki</p>
<p>        During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of  <br />  being<br />      a collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir),<br />      and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He<br />      claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation,  <br />  like a<br />      plumber or carpenter.<br />        After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself<br />      believed that the future of the West could depend on the New  <br />  Order.<br />      For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order<br />      brought new hope. In light of everything which has happened, it is<br />      of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New<br />      Order"[23]. The Tintin character was never depicted as adhering to<br />      these beliefs. However, it has been argued that anti-Semitic  <br />  themes<br />      continued, especially in the post-war Flight 714.[24]</p>

<p>              I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin<br />      Tin is simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson  <br />  and<br />      Thompson, the detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>              French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix<br />      cartoons, the pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized<br />      friend. The stories are about Gauls hating and bashing Romans  <br />  ( set<br />      in 2 BC) with the help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>              I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and<br />      Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of<br />      British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian<br />      Fleming , Anne Perry to name the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>              Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success'<br />      Raising the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold  <br />  in<br />      millions throughout the US and the challenges he faced building  <br />  the<br />      company virtually from his garage to an independent corporate.  <br />  Great<br />      story.</p>

<p>              Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with<br />      Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes  <br />  close<br />      to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot<br />      beat that).

<p>                   It never occurred to me we could have fans of  <br />  tintin in<br />      a fans' club of<br />                   kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I  <br />  luv<br />      to read tintin<br />                   comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite<br />      characters - both invite<br />                   trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired  <br />  me<br />      to read other books<br />                   to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in<br />      easy English series too.<br />                   I always wanted to own the entire collection of  <br />  tintin;       but managed to get<br />                   5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of  <br />  tintin<br />      and have them in my<br />                   Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the<br />      entire set of tintin<br />                   books :))</p>
<p>                   Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never  <br />  got<br />      quite fantacised by<br />                   it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>                   Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi<br />      was a character I loved<br />                   to read. But I recently read a rani comics and  <br />  found it<br />      too trivial - may be<br />                   I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>                   Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme  <br />  thinkers<br />      might think so but<br />                   overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all  <br />  over<br />      the world and is<br />                   considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving<br />      character to win the<br />                   World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole  <br />  fan<br />      clubs, hotels and<br />                   memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>                   I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if<br />      other Tintin fans are<br />                   there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite<br />      Tintin - mine is the<br />                   Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                      Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist  <br />  but<br />      no different from<br />                      attitudes and writings of her time. To  <br />  understand it<br />      better you have to<br />                      read her school books, Malory Towers and St  <br />  Clares -<br />      almost all the<br />                      children from other countries France, America,<br />      Africa and so on are<br />                      caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect<br />      British stereotypes. Of<br />                      course Asian kids dont even deserve mention ,  <br />  there<br />      is one adventure<br />                      book where there is an exotic brown guy magician<br />      named Uma. That is as<br />                      far as she came as far as asians go. None of the<br />      girls have any careers,<br />                      all of them grow up to be idealistic church going<br />      wives and mothers and<br />                      boys have to protect and guard girls all the time.<br />      Of course all that is<br />                      British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                      The Noddy series was edited to remove racist<br />      references about a few<br />                      years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in<br />      most of the States,<br />                      France and Germany too - but given our own  <br />  colonial<br />      history we did not<br />                      find it objectionable but most people from other<br />      countries do.</p>
<p>                      Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of<br />      originality, short<br />                      sentence construction and repeat usage of themes.<br />      The point also is that<br />                      she was creative and appealed to the escapist<br />      stories children love so<br />                      very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from<br />      childhood i browse now<br />                      and then and smile at the humor and memories they<br />      bring. There was a<br />                      time when I thought these were classics but that  <br />  is<br />      no longer there.</p>

<p>                        my favourite was the one in which the lands  <br />  change<br />      everyday above a<br />                        magic tree<br />                        one land was the land of rhymes where you had to<br />      answer to every query<br />                        with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>                        famous five ignited my interest in fiction.  <br />  uncle<br />      quentin being<br />                        kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a<br />      boy seems funny now.<br />                        if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt  <br />  right<br />      at that age.<br />                        fredricks middle name was alegron or something  <br />  so<br />      he was called<br />                        fatty.<br />                        does he come in secret seven?</p>
<p>                        of course after blyton boys branch out to hardy<br />      boys and girls to<br />                        mills and boons.<br />                        venketesh</p>

<p>      herge a nazi?</p>
<p>      from the wiki</p>
<p>      During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of being  <br />    a collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir),  <br />    and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He  <br />    claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation, like a  <br />    plumber or carpenter.<br />      After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself  <br />    believed that the future of the West could depend on the New Order.  <br />    For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order  <br />    brought new hope. In light of everything which has happened, it is  <br />    of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New  <br />    Order"[23]. The Tintin character was never depicted as adhering to  <br />    these beliefs. However, it has been argued that anti-Semitic themes  <br />    continued, especially in the post-war Flight 714.[24]</p>

<p>            I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin  <br />    Tin is simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and  <br />    Thompson, the detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>            French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix  <br />    cartoons, the pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized  <br />    friend. The stories are about Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set  <br />    in 2 BC) with the help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>            I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and  <br />    Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of  <br />    British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian  <br />    Fleming , Anne Perry to name the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>            Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success'  <br />    Raising the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in  <br />    millions throughout the US and the challenges he faced building the  <br />    company virtually from his garage to an independent corporate.

<p>            Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with  <br />    Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close  <br />    to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot  <br />    beat that).

Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv  <br />    to read tintin<br />                 comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite  <br />    characters - both invite<br />                 trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me  <br />    to read other books<br />                 to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in  <br />    easy English series too.<br />                 I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin;  <br />    but managed to get<br />                 5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin  <br />    and have them in my<br />                 Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the  <br />    entire set of tintin<br />                 books :))</p>
<p>                 Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got  <br />    quite fantacised by<br />                 it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>                 Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi  <br />    was a character I loved<br />                 to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it  <br />    too trivial - may be<br />                 I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>                 Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers  <br />    might think so but<br />                 overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over  <br />    the world and is<br />                 considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving  <br />    character to win the<br />                 World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan  <br />    clubs, hotels and<br />                 memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>                 I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if  <br />    other Tintin fans are<br />                 there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite  <br />    Tintin - mine is the<br />                 Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                    Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but  <br />    no different from<br />                    attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it  <br />    better you have to<br />                    read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares -  <br />    almost all the<br />                    children from other countries France, America,  <br />    Africa and so on are<br />                    caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect  <br />    British stereotypes. Of<br />                    course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there  <br />    is one adventure<br />                    book where there is an exotic brown guy magician  <br />    named Uma. That is as<br />                    far as she came as far as asians go. None of the  <br />    girls have any careers,<br />                    all of them grow up to be idealistic church going  <br />    wives and mothers and<br />                    boys have to protect and guard girls all the time.  <br />    Of course all that is<br />                    British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                    The Noddy series was edited to remove racist  <br />    references about a few<br />                    years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in  <br />    most of the States,<br />                    France and Germany too - but given our own colonial  <br />    history we did not<br />                    find it objectionable but most people from other  <br />    countries do.</p>
<p>                    Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of  <br />    originality, short<br />                    sentence construction and repeat usage of themes.  <br />    The point also is that<br />                    she was creative and appealed to the escapist  <br />    stories children love so<br />                    very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from  <br />    childhood i browse now<br />                    and then and smile at the humor and memories they  <br />    bring. There was a<br />                    time when I thought these were classics but that is  <br />    no longer there.</p>

<p>                        PAvithra, yes Blyton is a great story teller,  <br />    despite her unashamed<br />                        racism :) My favorite is the Frederick  <br />    Trotteville series what is<br />                        yours ?</p>
<p>                      Hi Maloo<br />                      blyton racist?? its so far into the past i dont  <br />    remember instances.</p>
<p>                      my favourite was the one in which the lands change  <br />    everyday above a<br />                      magic tree<br />                      one land was the land of rhymes where you had to  <br />    answer to every query<br />                      with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>                      famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle  <br />    quentin being<br />                      kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a  <br />    boy seems funny now.<br />                      if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right  <br />    at that age.<br />                      fredricks middle name was alegron or something so  <br />    he was called<br />                      fatty.<br />                      does he come in secret seven?</p>
<p>                      of course after blyton boys branch out to hardy  <br />    boys and girls to<br />                      mills and boons.<br />                      venketesh</p>

She didn't argue or fight with me was just asking  <br />    me a question - she said she has seen that with many countries who  <br />    have colonial background, you dont even realize what you are reading  <br />    is so biased and think it is ok.</p>

        <p>Dear Sunder,<br />Both 'Dennis the Menace' and 'Peanuts' originated in<br />Northern Calif. where I grew up. They were typical of<br />suburban life in single story, spread-out houses built<br />around there. It was easy to visualize families like<br />theirs -- parents appreciated the clean gentle humor.<br />Kathie</p>

<p>    herge a nazi?</p>
<p>    from the wiki</p>
<p>    During and after the German occupation Herg? was accused of being  <br />  a collaborator because of the Nazi control of the paper (Le Soir),  <br />  and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war.[22] He  <br />  claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation, like a  <br />  plumber or carpenter.<br />    After the war Herg? admitted that: "I recognize that I myself  <br />  believed that the future of the West could depend on the New Order.  <br />  For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order  <br />  brought new hope. In light of everything which has happened, it is  <br />  of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New  <br />  Order"[23]. The Tintin character was never depicted as adhering to  <br />  these beliefs. However, it has been argued that anti-Semitic themes  <br />  continued, especially in the post-war Flight 714.[24]</p>

<p>          French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix  <br />  cartoons, the pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized  <br />  friend. The stories are about Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set  <br />  in 2 BC) with the help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>          I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and  <br />  Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of   <br />  British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian  <br />  Fleming , Anne Perry to name the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>          Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success'  <br />  Raising the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in  <br />  millions throughout the US and the challenges he faced building the  <br />  company virtually from his garage to an independent corporate. Great  <br />  story.</p>

<p>          Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with  <br />  Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close  <br />  to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot  <br />  beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the  <br />  current list at hand.</p>

<p>           I have the whole new collection, set of 3s..also two  <br />  supplementary books detailing the history of tintin books and the  <br />  art work which has enhanced over the years. (The original tintin  <br />  artwork is somewhat like the originial mickey mouse..very bare  <br />  bones..).</p>
<p>           My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has  <br />  slowly transferred to silver screen adaptations. .given limited  <br />  time. The BBC series on both are amazing and have seen them a few  <br />  hundred times.</p>

<p>               It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in  <br />  a fans' club of<br />               kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv  <br />  to read tintin<br />               comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite  <br />  characters - both invite<br />               trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me  <br />  to read other books<br />               to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in  <br />  easy English series too.<br />               I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin;  <br />  but managed to get<br />               5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin  <br />  and have them in my<br />               Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the  <br />  entire set of tintin<br />               books :))</p>
<p>               Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got  <br />  quite fantacised by<br />               it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>               Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi  <br />  was a character I loved<br />               to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it  <br />  too trivial - may be<br />               I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>               Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>               Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers  <br />  might think so but<br />               overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over  <br />  the world and is<br />               considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving  <br />  character to win the<br />               World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan  <br />  clubs, hotels and<br />               memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>               I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if  <br />  other Tintin fans are<br />               there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite  <br />  Tintin - mine is the<br />               Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                  Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but  <br />  no different from<br />                  attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it  <br />  better you have to<br />                  read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares -  <br />  almost all the<br />                  children from other countries France, America,  <br />  Africa and so on are<br />                  caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect  <br />  British stereotypes. Of<br />                  course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there  <br />  is one adventure<br />                  book where there is an exotic brown guy magician  <br />  named Uma. That is as<br />                  far as she came as far as asians go. None of the  <br />  girls have any careers,<br />                  all of them grow up to be idealistic church going  <br />  wives and mothers and<br />                  boys have to protect and guard girls all the time.  <br />  Of course all that is<br />                  British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                  The Noddy series was edited to remove racist  <br />  references about a few<br />                  years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in  <br />  most of the States,<br />                  France and Germany too - but given our own colonial  <br />  history we did not<br />                  find it objectionable but most people from other  <br />  countries do.</p>
<p>                  Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of  <br />  originality, short<br />                  sentence construction and repeat usage of themes.  <br />  The point also is that<br />                  she was creative and appealed to the escapist  <br />  stories children love so<br />                  very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from  <br />  childhood i browse now<br />                  and then and smile at the humor and memories they  <br />  bring. There was a<br />                  time when I thought these were classics but that is  <br />  no longer there.</p>

        <p>Many times, yes.<br />A country where politicians rush to ban 'Da Vinci...' or 'Satanic..' but donot care about western films which caricature Indians and Indian traditions in poor light.

<p>?</p>
<p>hi all</p>
<p>i think this question should be asked once in a few months to kindle interest in reading.</p>
<p>and that too opportunities to read a different genre of book can be generated</p>
<p>I am reading two books now. </p>
<p>CARNATIC SUMMER by v . sriram who participated as a guest in our open house. its about 20 great carnatic musicians. to my surprise my family was mentioned in the second page regarding the article on ariyakudi ramanuja iyengar.</p>
<p>also reading</p>
<p>AGATHA CHRITIE- the finished portrait</p>
<p>this is about one of my favourite authors.mystery writer agatha christie vanished from her home and was missing for 11 days. this book is a full scaleresearch on what may have happened during that period.</p>
<p>please let us all know what you are reading.</p>

<p>?</p>
<p>hi all</p>
<p>i think this question should be asked once in a few months to kindle interest in reading.</p>
<p>and that too opportunities to read a different genre of book can be generated</p>
<p>I am reading two books now. </p>
<p>CARNATIC SUMMER by v . sriram who participated as a guest in our open house. its about 20 great carnatic musicians. to my surprise my family was mentioned in the second page regarding the article on ariyakudi ramanuja iyengar.</p>
<p>also reading</p>
<p>AGATHA CHRITIE- the finished portrait</p>
<p>this is about one of my favourite authors.mystery writer agatha christie vanished from her home and was missing for 11 days. this book is a full scaleresearch on what may have happened during that period.</p>
<p>please let us all know what you are reading.</p>

<p>        I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply<br />        unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson, the<br />        detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>        French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix cartoons,the<br />        pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized friend. The stories<br />      are<br />        about Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) with the help of<br />      the<br />        village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>        I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense'a<br />        collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of British mystery-<br />        Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perryto<br />      name<br />        the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>        Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising theBar'<br />      by<br />        Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughoutthe<br />      US<br />        and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his<br />      garage<br />        to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>        Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr<br />      in<br />        the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times<br />      as<br />        I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have readit<br />      again<br />        as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>           It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club<br />      of<br />           kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />           comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both<br />           invite<br />           trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other<br />           books<br />           to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English<br />      series<br />           too.<br />           I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to<br />           get<br />           5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and havethem<br />      in<br />           my<br />           Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of<br />           tintin<br />           books :))</p>
<p>           Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite<br />      fantacised<br />           by<br />           it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>           Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I<br />           loved<br />           to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial -<br />           may be<br />           I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>           Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>           Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so<br />           but<br />           overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the worldand<br />      is<br />           considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win<br />      the<br />           World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels<br />      and<br />           memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>           I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintinfans<br />           are<br />           there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />           Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>              Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />              from<br />              attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you<br />      have<br />              to<br />              read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />              children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />              caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes.<br />      Of<br />              course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one<br />      adventure<br />              book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is<br />              as<br />              far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />              careers,<br />              all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />              and<br />              boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all<br />      that<br />              is<br />              British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>              The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references abouta few<br />              years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the<br />      States,<br />              France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />              not<br />              find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>              Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality,<br />      short<br />              sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is<br />              that<br />              she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />              so<br />              very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />              now<br />              and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was<br />      a<br />              time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer<br />      there.</p>

<p>                famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />                kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny<br />                now.<br />                if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />                fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />                fatty.<br />                does he come in secret seven?</p>

<p>Hi Udanx</p>
<p>picked up this trivia from wiki</p>
<p>His trademark phrase is "These Romans are crazy" in the Italian translation, it is "Sono pazzi questi Romani", which can be shortened to S.P.Q.R., (Rome's motto SPQR is an initialism from a Latin phrase, Senatus Populusque Romanus ("The Senate and the People of Rome" or "The Senate and Roman People")</p>

<p>      I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply<br />      unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson, the<br />      detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>      French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix cartoons, the<br />      pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized friend. The stories<br />    are<br />      about Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) with the help of<br />    the<br />      village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>      I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a<br />      collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of British mystery-<br />      Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to<br />    name<br />      the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>      Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar'<br />    by<br />      Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout the<br />    US<br />      and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his<br />    garage<br />      to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>      Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr<br />    in<br />      the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times<br />    as<br />      I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it<br />    again<br />      as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>      My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has slowly transferred<br />    to<br />      silver screen adaptations. .given limited time. The BBC series on both<br />    are<br />      amazing and have seen them a few hundred times.</p>

<p>         It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club<br />    of<br />         kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />         comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both<br />         invite<br />         trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other<br />         books<br />         to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English<br />    series<br />         too.<br />         I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to<br />         get<br />         5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them<br />    in<br />         my<br />         Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of<br />         tintin<br />         books :))</p>
<p>         Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite<br />    fantacised<br />         by<br />         it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>         Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I<br />         loved<br />         to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial -<br />         may be<br />         I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>         Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>         Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so<br />         but<br />         overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and<br />    is<br />         considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win<br />    the<br />         World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels<br />    and<br />         memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>         I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans<br />         are<br />         there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine isthe<br />         Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>            Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />            from<br />            attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you<br />    have<br />            to<br />            read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost allthe<br />            children from other countries France, America, Africa and so onare<br />            caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes.<br />    Of<br />            course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one<br />    adventure<br />            book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is<br />            as<br />            far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />            careers,<br />            all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />            and<br />            boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all<br />    that<br />            is<br />            British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>            The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about afew<br />            years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the<br />    States,<br />            France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />            not<br />            find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>            Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality,<br />    short<br />            sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is<br />            that<br />            she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />            so<br />            very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />            now<br />            and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was<br />    a<br />            time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer<br />    there.</p>

        <p>Sorry Pav, just wanted to clarify some facts that is all since i went down same path myself - i asked in no less than 3 libraries in states for Enid Blyton books. In the last one a librarian gave me the story - she asked me in fact give me one good reason why i should have books like that that show my country and our kids in such poor light. She didn't argue or fight with me was just asking me a question - she said she has seen that with many countries who have colonial background, you dont even realize what you are reading is so biased and think it is ok.</p>
<p>Sorry but i just had to give you the history that is all.</p>

<p>     I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply<br />     unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson,?the<br />     detective?twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>     French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is?in Asterix cartoons, the<br />     pint?sized hero Asterix ?and Obelix his over sized friend. The stories are<br />     about??Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) ?with the help of<br />     the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>     I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a<br />     collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery-<br />     Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to<br />     name the prominent few.?Just loved it.</p>
<p>     Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar'<br />     by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughoutthe<br />     US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his<br />     garage to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>     Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in<br />     the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times<br />     as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have readit<br />     again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>         It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club<br />         of<br />         kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />         comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both<br />         invite<br />         trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other<br />         books<br />         to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English<br />         series too.<br />         I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to<br />         get<br />         5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them<br />         in my<br />         Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of<br />         tintin<br />         books :))</p>
<p>         Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite<br />         fantacised by<br />         it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>         Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I<br />         loved<br />         to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial -<br />         may be<br />         I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>         Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>         Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so<br />         but<br />         overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and<br />         is<br />         considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win<br />         the<br />         World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels<br />         and<br />         memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>         I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans<br />         are<br />         there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine isthe<br />         Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>            Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />            from<br />            attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you<br />            have to<br />            read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost allthe<br />            children from other countries France, America, Africa and so onare<br />            caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes.<br />            Of<br />            course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one<br />            adventure<br />            book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is<br />            as<br />            far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />            careers,<br />            all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />            and<br />            boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all<br />            that is<br />            British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>            The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about afew<br />            years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the<br />            States,<br />            France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />            not<br />            find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>            Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality,<br />            short<br />            sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is<br />            that<br />            she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />            so<br />            very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />            now<br />            and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was<br />            a<br />            time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer<br />            there.</p>

<p>              famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />              kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny<br />              now.<br />              if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />              fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />              fatty.<br />              does he come in secret seven?</p>

<p>  what naming<br />  vitalstatistix, getafix, cacafonix</p>
<p>  can you for a moment imagine it was not written in english first?</p>
<p>  the best thing about asterix is you note something new everytime you read<br />  it.<br />  my favourites are the mansion of the gods, and obleix and co</p>
<p>  both have a common theme of commercialism getting into normally run lives.</p>

<p>   I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply<br />   unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson,?the<br />   detective?twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>   French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is?in Asterix cartoons, the<br />   pint?sized hero Asterix ?and Obelix his over sized friend. The stories are<br />   about??Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) ?with the help of<br />   the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>   I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a<br />   collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery-<br />   Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to<br />   name the prominent few.?Just loved it.</p>
<p>   Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar'<br />   by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout the<br />   US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his<br />   garage to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>   Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in<br />   the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times<br />   as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it<br />   again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>       It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club<br />       of<br />       kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />       comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both<br />       invite<br />       trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other<br />       books<br />       to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English<br />       series too.<br />       I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to<br />       get<br />       5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them<br />       in my<br />       Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of<br />       tintin<br />       books :))</p>
<p>       Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite<br />       fantacised by<br />       it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>       Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a characterI<br />       loved<br />       to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial -<br />       may be<br />       I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>       Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>       Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so<br />       but<br />       overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and<br />       is<br />       considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win<br />       the<br />       World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels<br />       and<br />       memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>       I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans<br />       are<br />       there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />       Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>          Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />          from<br />          attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you<br />          have to<br />          read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />          children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />          caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes.<br />          Of<br />          course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one<br />          adventure<br />          book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is<br />          as<br />          far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />          careers,<br />          all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />          and<br />          boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all<br />          that is<br />          British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>          The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />          years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the<br />          States,<br />          France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />          not<br />          find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>          Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality,<br />          short<br />          sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is<br />          that<br />          she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />          so<br />          very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />          now<br />          and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was<br />          a<br />          time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer<br />          there.</p>

<p>            famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />            kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny<br />            now.<br />            if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />            fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />            fatty.<br />            does he come in secret seven?</p>

<p>  I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson,?the detective?twins who botch up every lead they pursue. <br />  ?<br />  French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is?in Asterix cartoons, thepint?sized hero Asterix ?and Obelix his over sized friend. The storiesare about??Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) ?with the help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.<br />  ?<br />  I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to name the prominent few.?Just loved it.<br />  ?<br />  Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout the US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his garage to an independent corporate. Great story.<br />  ?<br />  TMS<br />  ?</p>

<p>  Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>  I have the whole new collection, set of 3s..also two supplementary books detailing the history of tintin books and the art work which has enhanced over the years. (The original tintin artwork is somewhat like the originial mickey mouse..very bare bones..).</p>
<p>  My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has slowly transferredto silver screen adaptations. .given limited time. The BBC series on both are amazing and have seen them a few hundred times.</p>

<p>      It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />      kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />      comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />      trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other books<br />      to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series too.<br />      I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />      5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have themin my<br />      Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />      books :))</p>
<p>      Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />      it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>      Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />      to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial -may be<br />      I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>      Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>      Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />      overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />      considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />      World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />      memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>      I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fansare<br />      there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />      Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>       You are right maloo.<br />       racism should be seen in literature taking into context the years itwas<br />       written in.<br />       a book is a mirror of its times.<br />       now my other favourite tintin is accused of being racist</p>

<p>         Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />         attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />         read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />         children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />         caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes.Of<br />         course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />         book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as<br />         far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />         all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />         boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />         British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>         The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />         years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />         France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we didnot<br />         find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>         Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />         sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that<br />         she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />         very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />         and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There wasa<br />         time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>I didn't much like the Naughtiest Girl thing - it seemed so much a?Treatise?on How Girls Must Behave tripe that I gave up after half a book. :) Blyton seemed better when she forgot to be all moralistic and goody-goody. I did go on a Nancy Drew and Hardy Boy kick after that - but I never did get into Mills and Boon. Dunno why.?</p>
<p>The cookbooks seem a great read. Must try them. Speaking of cooking - anyone watch Nigella Lawson's shows? :)))))</p>

        <p>Hi Sundar, Blyton is not accepted in other parts of the world, including USfor her blatantly racist writing. Noddy was allowed some years ago in US public libraries after some editing of racist comments. Some school series like Malory towers show american kids in very bad light. They will not allowthat here.</p>
<p>Much as we enjoyed it..makes us think..we indians are the only back boneless, wimpy characters in the world sometimes..</p>

<p>      I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply<br />      unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson,?the<br />      detective?twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>      French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is?in Asterix cartoons,the<br />      pint?sized hero Asterix ?and Obelix his over sized friend. The stories are<br />      about??Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) ?with thehelp of the<br />      village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>      I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a<br />      collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery-<br />      Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to name<br />      the prominent few.?Just loved it.</p>
<p>      Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar' by<br />      Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout the US<br />      and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his garage<br />      to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>      Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in<br />      the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as<br />      I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again<br />      as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>         It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />         kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />         comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both<br />         invite<br />         trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other<br />         books<br />         to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series<br />         too.<br />         I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to<br />         get<br />         5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in<br />         my<br />         Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of<br />         tintin<br />         books :))</p>
<p>         Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised<br />         by<br />         it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>         Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I<br />         loved<br />         to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial -<br />         may be<br />         I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>         Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>         Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so<br />         but<br />         overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />         considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />         World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />         memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>         I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans<br />         are<br />         there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine isthe<br />         Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>            Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />            from<br />            attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better youhave<br />            to<br />            read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost allthe<br />            children from other countries France, America, Africa and so onare<br />            caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />            course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />            book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is<br />            as<br />            far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />            careers,<br />            all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />            and<br />            boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that<br />            is<br />            British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>            The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about afew<br />            years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />            France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />            not<br />            find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>            Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />            sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is<br />            that<br />            she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />            so<br />            very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />            now<br />            and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />            time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>              my favourite was the one in which the lands change everyday above a<br />              magic tree<br />              one land was the land of rhymes where you had to answer to every<br />              query<br />              with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>              famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />              kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny<br />              now.<br />              if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />              fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />              fatty.<br />              does he come in secret seven?</p>

<p>    I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a<br />    collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery-<br />    Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to name<br />    the prominent few.?Just loved it.</p>
<p>    Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar' by<br />    Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout theUS<br />    and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his garage<br />    to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>    Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jrin<br />    the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as<br />    I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again<br />    as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>       It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' clubof<br />       kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />       comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both<br />       invite<br />       trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other<br />       books<br />       to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series<br />       too.<br />       I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to<br />       get<br />       5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in<br />       my<br />       Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of<br />       tintin<br />       books :))</p>
<p>       Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised<br />       by<br />       it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>       Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a characterI<br />       loved<br />       to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial -<br />       may be<br />       I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>       Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>       Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so<br />       but<br />       overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world andis<br />       considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />       World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotelsand<br />       memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>       I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans<br />       are<br />       there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />       Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>          Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />          from<br />          attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have<br />          to<br />          read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />          children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />          caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />          course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />          book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is<br />          as<br />          far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />          careers,<br />          all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />          and<br />          boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that<br />          is<br />          British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>          The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />          years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />          France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />          not<br />          find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>          Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />          sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is<br />          that<br />          she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />          so<br />          very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />          now<br />          and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />          time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>            famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />            kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny<br />            now.<br />            if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />            fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />            fatty.<br />            does he come in secret seven?</p>

My mother asked me immediately if the author is female, and then<br />  said<br />      that is what, she is writing about other women like that. There was<br />  another<br />      Blyton book 'Naughtiest girl in school' too very sexist stuff my mom<br />  asked<br />      again why not Naughtiest boy. But can't deny those books were fun to<br />  read.</p>

        <p>Yeah not surprising..France gets a very bad rap from many writers esp more if they are english or american. European cultures are close knit, less diverse and more conservative so the average 'liberal' writer finds that funnymany times...am so used to seeing our own culture being treated with so much of contempt and stereotyped opinions why would France be any different for them.</p>

<p>             I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is<br />    simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson, the<br />    detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>             French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix<br />    cartoons, the pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized friend. The<br />    stories are about Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) withthe<br />    help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>             I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and<br />    Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of British<br />    mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry<br />    to name the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>             Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising<br />    the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions<br />    throughout the US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually<br />    from his garage to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>             Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert<br />    Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to readingas<br />    many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess Ihave<br />    read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read<br />    tintin<br />                 comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters<br />    - both invite<br />                 trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read<br />    other books<br />                 to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy<br />    English series too.<br />                 I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but<br />    managed to get<br />                 5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and<br />    have them in my<br />                 Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire<br />    set of tintin<br />                 books :))</p>
<p>                 Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite<br />    fantacised by<br />                 it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>                 Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a<br />    character I loved<br />                 to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too<br />    trivial - may be<br />                 I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>                 Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might<br />    think so but<br />                 overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the<br />    world and is<br />                 considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character<br />    to win the<br />                 World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs,<br />    hotels and<br />                 memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>                 I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other<br />    Tintin fans are<br />                 there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin -<br />    mine is the<br />                 Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                    Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no<br />    different from<br />                    attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better<br />    you have to<br />                    read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost<br />    all the<br />                    children from other countries France, America, Africa and<br />    so on are<br />                    caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British<br />    stereotypes. Of<br />                    course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one<br />    adventure<br />                    book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma.<br />    That is as<br />                    far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have<br />    any careers,<br />                    all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wivesand<br />    mothers and<br />                    boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of<br />    course all that is<br />                    British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                    The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references<br />    about a few<br />                    years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of<br />    the States,<br />                    France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history<br />    we did not<br />                    find it objectionable but most people from other countries<br />    do.</p>
<p>                    Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of<br />    originality, short<br />                    sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point<br />    also is that<br />                    she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories<br />    children love so<br />                    very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood<br />    i browse now<br />                    and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring.<br />    There was a<br />                    time when I thought these were classics but that is no<br />    longer there.</p>

<p>                      famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin<br />    being<br />                      kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems<br />    funny now.<br />                      if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at<br />    that age.<br />                      fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was<br />    called<br />                      fatty.<br />                      does he come in secret seven?</p>
<p>                      of course after blyton boys branch out to hardy boys and<br />    girls to<br />                      mills and boons.<br />                      venketesh</p>

<p>           I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is<br />  simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson, the<br />  detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>           French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix<br />  cartoons, the pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized friend. The<br />  stories are about Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) with the<br />  help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>           I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and<br />  Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of British<br />  mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry<br />  to name the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>           Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising<br />  the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions<br />  throughout the US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually<br />  from his garage to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>           Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert<br />  Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as<br />  many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have<br />  read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>               It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a<br />  fans' club of<br />               kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read<br />  tintin<br />               comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters<br />  - both invite<br />               trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read<br />  other books<br />               to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy<br />  English series too.<br />               I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but<br />  managed to get<br />               5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and<br />  have them in my<br />               Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire<br />  set of tintin<br />               books :))</p>
<p>               Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite<br />  fantacised by<br />               it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>               Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a<br />  character I loved<br />               to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too<br />  trivial - may be<br />               I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>               Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>               Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might<br />  think so but<br />               overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the<br />  world and is<br />               considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character<br />  to win the<br />               World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs,<br />  hotels and<br />               memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>               I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other<br />  Tintin fans are<br />               there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin -<br />  mine is the<br />               Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                  Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no<br />  different from<br />                  attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better<br />  you have to<br />                  read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost<br />  all the<br />                  children from other countries France, America, Africa and<br />  so on are<br />                  caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British<br />  stereotypes. Of<br />                  course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one<br />  adventure<br />                  book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma.<br />  That is as<br />                  far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have<br />  any careers,<br />                  all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and<br />  mothers and<br />                  boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of<br />  course all that is<br />                  British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                  The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references<br />  about a few<br />                  years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of<br />  the States,<br />                  France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history<br />  we did not<br />                  find it objectionable but most people from other countries<br />  do.</p>
<p>                  Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of<br />  originality, short<br />                  sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point<br />  also is that<br />                  she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories<br />  children love so<br />                  very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood<br />  i browse now<br />                  and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring.<br />  There was a<br />                  time when I thought these were classics but that is no<br />  longer there.</p>

<p>                    my favourite was the one in which the lands change<br />  everyday above a<br />                    magic tree<br />                    one land was the land of rhymes where you had to answer<br />  to every query<br />                    with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>                    famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin<br />  being<br />                    kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems<br />  funny now.<br />                    if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at<br />  that age.<br />                    fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was<br />  called<br />                    fatty.<br />                    does he come in secret seven?</p>
<p>                    of course after blyton boys branch out to hardy boys and<br />  girls to<br />                    mills and boons.<br />                    venketesh</p>

<p>         I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson,?thedetective?twins who botch up every lead they pursue. <br />         ?<br />         French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is?in Asterix cartoons, the pint?sized hero Asterix ?and Obelix his over sized friend. The stories are about??Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) ?with the help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.<br />         ?<br />         I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry toname the prominent few.?Just loved it.<br />         ?<br />         Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout the US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his garage to an independent corporate.

<p>         Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as manytimes as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>         My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has slowly transferred to silver screen adaptations. .given limited time. The BBC series on both are amazing and have seen them a few hundred times.</p>

<p>             It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />             kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to readtintin<br />             comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />             trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to readother books<br />             to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series too.<br />             I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />             5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in my<br />             Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />             books :))</p>
<p>             Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />             it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>             Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />             to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />             I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>             Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />             overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />             considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />             World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />             memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>             I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are<br />             there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />             Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>                Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />                attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it betteryou have to<br />                read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almostall the<br />                children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />                caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />                course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />                book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma.That is as<br />                far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls haveany careers,<br />                all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives andmothers and<br />                boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />                British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>                The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />                years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />                France and Germany too - but given our own colonial historywe did not<br />                find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>                Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />                sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The pointalso is that<br />                she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />                very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />                and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />                time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>? <br />I am reading some great historical fiction (never tire of the genre!) by Robert Harris. The 2 books I just finished are</p>
<p>a. Pompeii - a fictional account of a aqueduct engineer who first recognizes that something horrible is going to happen and who, along with his lover,survives the volcanic eruption. It was fascinating to read about the engineering and management of water and the rationing/provision ing of water based on need. Susequently, I found many web articles on the Roman aqueduct system - they had advanced means of diverting water from springs even throughtunnel under mountains and storing them in reservoirs, building pressure to reach far areas, etc. Of course, history also points out the influence ofrich people, corruption/bribery are eternal :)) Strongly recommend. </p>
<p>b. Imperium - a fictional account of Cicero's rise to power in the Roman republic, told by his slave/secretary, Tiro. Tiro is credited to have invented short hand and the much used "&amp;" symbol. It is a good account of the whole Roman system of governance and the politics/elections. It also marginallygoes into Cicero's philosophical thinking. </p>
<p>What struck me in both cases is that though fictional accounts, there is substantial truth to the incidents/character s, because of the physical historical evidence available. Many of Cicero's letters to his best friend, Atticus are available today (translated version available in duke university website). We are talking about 1st century AD here and it is astonishing thatthese have survived. <br />(I can't help a wistful desire that more evidence of our culture were available to us now.)</p>
<p>On the side, I am also reading great crime fiction by Ngaio Marsh - very Christie-like, but slow-moving, yet gripping thriller!</p>
<p>And I agree, dear old Plum Woodhouse rules the roost.. immense re-read potential and a sure-fire prescription for a gloomy mood :)</p>
<p>Have fun!<br />Deepa</p>

<p>       I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply unputdownable.

The stories are about??Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) ?withthe help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.<br />       ?<br />       I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to name the prominent few.?Just loved it.<br />       ?<br />       Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughoutthe US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from hisgarage to an independent corporate.

<p>       Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert DowneyJr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have readit again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>       I have the whole new collection, set of 3s..also two supplementary books detailing the history of tintin books and the art work which has enhanced over the years. (The original tintin artwork is somewhat like the originial mickey mouse..very bare bones..).</p>
<p>       My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has slowly transferred to silver screen adaptations. .given limited time. The BBC series on both are amazing and have seen them a few hundred times.</p>

<p>           It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />           kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />           comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />           trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other books<br />           to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy Englishseries too.<br />           I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />           5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and havethem in my<br />           Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />           books :))</p>
<p>           Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />           it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>           Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />           to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />           I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>           Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />           overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the worldand is<br />           considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />           World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />           memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>           I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintinfans are<br />           there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />           Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>              Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />              attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />              read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />              children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />              caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />              course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />              book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as<br />              far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />              all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />              boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />              British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>              The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references abouta few<br />              years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of theStates,<br />              France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not<br />              find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>              Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />              sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that<br />              she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />              very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />              and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />              time when I thought these were classics but that is no longerthere.</p>

<p>        I think it is..and i felt the same..i was about 8th grade when i read<br />    it. My mother asked me immediately if the author is female, and then said<br />    that is what, she is writing about other women like that. There was another<br />    Blyton book 'Naughtiest girl in school' too very sexist stuff my mom asked<br />    again why not Naughtiest boy. But can't deny those books were fun to read.</p>

<p>? </p>
<p>hi all</p>
<p>i think this question should be asked once in a few months to kindle interest in reading.<br />and that too opportunities to read a different genre of book can be generated</p>
<p>I am reading two books now. <br />CARNATIC SUMMER by v . sriram who participated as a guest in our open house. its about 20 great carnatic musicians. to my surprise my family was mentioned in the second page regarding the article on ariyakudi ramanuja iyengar.</p>
<p>also reading<br />AGATHA CHRITIE- the finished portrait<br />this is about one of my favourite authors.mystery writer agatha christie vanished from her home and was missing for 11 days. this book is a full scaleresearch on what may have happened during that period.</p>
<p>please let us all know what you are reading.</p>

<p>        I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is<br />  simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson, the<br />  detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>        French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix cartoons,<br />  the pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized friend. The stories<br />  are about Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) with the help of<br />  the village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>        I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense'a<br />  collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of British mystery-<br />  Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to name<br />  the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>        Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the<br />  Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout<br />  the US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his<br />  garage to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>        Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey<br />  Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many<br />  times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read<br />  it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>            Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite<br />  fantacised by<br />            it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>            Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a<br />  character I loved<br />            to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too<br />  trivial - may be<br />            I have grown up ! :).</p>

<p>            Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might<br />  think so but<br />            overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world<br />  and is<br />            considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to<br />  win the<br />            World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs,<br />  hotels and<br />            memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>            I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin<br />  fans are<br />            there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine<br />  is the<br />            Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>               Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no<br />  different from<br />               attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better<br />  you have to<br />               read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost<br />  all the<br />               children from other countries France, America, Africa and so<br />  on are<br />               caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British<br />  stereotypes. Of<br />               course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one<br />  adventure<br />               book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma.<br />  That is as<br />               far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have<br />  any careers,<br />               all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and<br />  mothers and<br />               boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course<br />  all that is<br />               British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>               The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about<br />  a few<br />               years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the<br />  States,<br />               France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we<br />  did not<br />               find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>               Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality,<br />  short<br />               sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point<br />  also is that<br />               she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children<br />  love so<br />               very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i<br />  browse now<br />               and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There<br />  was a<br />               time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer<br />  there.</p>

<p>                 famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin<br />  being<br />                 kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems<br />  funny now.<br />                 if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that<br />  age.<br />                 fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was<br />  called<br />                 fatty.<br />                 does he come in secret seven?</p>

But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in my<br />          Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />          books :))</p>
<p>          Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />          it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>          Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />          to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />          I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>          Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>          Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />          overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />          considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />          World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />          memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>          I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are<br />          there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />          Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>             Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />             attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />             read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />             children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />             caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />             course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />             book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as<br />             far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />             all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />             boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />             British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>             The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />             years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />             France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history wedid not<br />             find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>             Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality,short<br />             sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that<br />             she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories childrenlove so<br />             very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />             and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. Therewas a<br />             time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>                 PAvithra, yes Blyton is a great story teller, despite her unashamed<br />                 racism :) My favorite is the Frederick Trotteville series what is<br />                 yours ?</p>
<p>               Hi Maloo<br />               blyton racist?? its so far into the past i dont remember instances.</p>
<p>               my favourite was the one in which the lands change everyday above a<br />               magic tree<br />               one land was the land of rhymes where you had to answer to every query<br />               with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>               famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />               kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny now.<br />               if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />               fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />               fatty.<br />               does he come in secret seven?</p>
<p>               of course after blyton boys branch out to hardy boys and girls to<br />               mills and boons.<br />               venketesh</p>

Great humor.<br />    ?<br />    I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to namethe prominent few.?Just loved it.<br />    ?<br />    Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout the US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his garage to an independent corporate.

<p>    Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jrin the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read itagain as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>        Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might thinkso but<br />        overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />        considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to winthe<br />        World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />        memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>

<p>           Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />           attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />           read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />           children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />           caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />           course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />           book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. Thatis as<br />           far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />           all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />           boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course allthat is<br />           British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>           The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />           years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />           France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not<br />           find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>           Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />           sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point alsois that<br />           she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />           very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />           and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />           time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>    I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply<br />    unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson,?the<br />    detective?twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>    French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is?in Asterix cartoons, the<br />    pint?sized hero Asterix ?and Obelix his over sized friend. The stories are<br />    about??Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) ?with the help of the<br />    village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>    I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a<br />    collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery-<br />    Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to name<br />    the prominent few.?Just loved it.</p>
<p>    Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar' by<br />    Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout theUS<br />    and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his garage<br />    to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>    Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jrin<br />    the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as<br />    I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again<br />    as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>    My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has slowly transferred to<br />    silver screen adaptations. .given limited time. The BBC series on both are<br />    amazing and have seen them a few hundred times.</p>

<p>       It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' clubof<br />       kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />       comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both<br />       invite<br />       trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other<br />       books<br />       to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series<br />       too.<br />       I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to<br />       get<br />       5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in<br />       my<br />       Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of<br />       tintin<br />       books :))</p>
<p>       Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised<br />       by<br />       it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>       Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a characterI<br />       loved<br />       to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial -<br />       may be<br />       I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>       Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>       Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so<br />       but<br />       overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world andis<br />       considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />       World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotelsand<br />       memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>       I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans<br />       are<br />       there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />       Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>  I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson,?the detective?twins who botch up every lead they pursue. <br />  ?<br />  French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is?in Asterix cartoons, thepint?sized hero Asterix ?and Obelix his over sized friend. The storiesare about??Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) ?with the help of the village druid's potion. Great humor.<br />  ?<br />  I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of??British mystery- Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to name the prominent few.?Just loved it.<br />  ?<br />  Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar' by Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout the US and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his garage to an independent corporate. Great story.<br />  ?<br />  TMS<br />  ?</p>

<p>  Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times as I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>  I have the whole new collection, set of 3s..also two supplementary books detailing the history of tintin books and the art work which has enhanced over the years. (The original tintin artwork is somewhat like the originial mickey mouse..very bare bones..).</p>
<p>  My interest in Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie has slowly transferredto silver screen adaptations. .given limited time. The BBC series on both are amazing and have seen them a few hundred times.</p>

<p>      It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />      kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />      comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />      trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other books<br />      to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English series too.<br />      I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />      5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have themin my<br />      Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />      books :))</p>
<p>      Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacised by<br />      it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>      Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />      to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial -may be<br />      I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>      Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>      Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />      overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />      considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />      World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />      memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>      I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fansare<br />      there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />      Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>         Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />         attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have to<br />         read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />         children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />         caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes.Of<br />         course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />         book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as<br />         far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />         all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />         boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />         British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>         The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />         years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />         France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we didnot<br />         find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>         Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />         sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that<br />         she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />         very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />         and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There wasa<br />         time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

          what book are you reading now?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I am reading some great historical fiction (never tire of the genre!) by Robert Harris. The 2 books I just finished are</p>
<p>a. Pompeii - a fictional account of a aqueduct engineer who first recognizes that something horrible is going to happen and who, along with his lover,survives the volcanic eruption. It was fascinating to read about the engineering and management of water and the rationing/provisioning of water based on need. Susequently, I found many web articles on the Roman aqueduct system - they had advanced means of diverting water from springs even through tunnel under mountains and storing them in reservoirs, building pressure toreach far areas, etc. Of course, history also points out the influence of rich people, corruption/bribery are eternal :)) Strongly recommend. </p>
<p>b. Imperium - a fictional account of Cicero's rise to power in the Roman republic, told by his slave/secretary, Tiro. Tiro is credited to have invented short hand and the much used "&amp;" symbol. It is a good account of the whole Roman system of governance and the politics/elections. It also marginallygoes into Cicero's philosophical thinking. </p>
<p>What struck me in both cases is that though fictional accounts, there is substantial truth to the incidents/characters, because of the physical historical evidence available. Many of Cicero's letters to his best friend, Atticus are available today (translated version available in duke university website). We are talking about 1st century AD here and it is astonishing that these have survived. <br />(I can't help a wistful desire that more evidence of our culture were available to us now.)</p>
<p>On the side, I am also reading great crime fiction by Ngaio Marsh - very Christie-like, but slow-moving, yet gripping thriller!</p>
<p>And I agree, dear old Plum Woodhouse rules the roost.. immense re-read potential and a sure-fire prescription for a gloomy mood :)</p>
<p>Have fun!<br />Deepa</p>

<p>    I have been Herge's fan from my childhood days, every Tin Tin is simply<br />    unputdownable. My favorite characters are Thomson and Thompson, the<br />    detective twins who botch up every lead they pursue.</p>
<p>    French tongue in cheek at it best I enjoyed is in Asterix cartoons, the<br />    pint sized hero Asterix and Obelix his over sized friend. The stories<br />  are<br />    about Gauls hating and bashing Romans ( set in 2 BC) with the help of<br />  the<br />    village druid's potion. Great humor.</p>
<p>    I just finished reading 'A Century of British Mystery and Suspense' a<br />    collection of 38 odd short stories from who is who of British mystery-<br />    Doyle, Forsyth, GKC, PGW, Agatha Christie, Ian Fleming , Anne Perry to<br />  name<br />    the prominent few. Just loved it.</p>
<p>    Now reading an inspirational book of corporate success' Raising the Bar'<br />  by<br />    Cary Ericson founder of energy bar Clif sold in millions throughout the<br />  US<br />    and the challenges he faced building the company virtually from his<br />  garage<br />    to an independent corporate. Great story.</p>

<p>    Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr<br />  in<br />    the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times<br />  as<br />    I have read PS(though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it<br />  again<br />    as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>       Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so<br />       but<br />       overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and<br />  is<br />       considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win<br />  the<br />       World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels<br />  and<br />       memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>       I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans<br />       are<br />       there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />       Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>          Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />          from<br />          attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you<br />  have<br />          to<br />          read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />          children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />          caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes.<br />  Of<br />          course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one<br />  adventure<br />          book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is<br />          as<br />          far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />          careers,<br />          all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />          and<br />          boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all<br />  that<br />          is<br />          British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>          The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />          years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the<br />  States,<br />          France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />          not<br />          find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>          Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality,<br />  short<br />          sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is<br />          that<br />          she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />          so<br />          very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />          now<br />          and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was<br />  a<br />          time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer<br />  there.</p>

<p>            Hi Maloo<br />            blyton racist?? its so far into the past i dont remember<br />  instances.</p>
<p>            my favourite was the one in which the lands change everyday above<br />  a<br />            magic tree<br />            one land was the land of rhymes where you had to answer to every<br />            query<br />            with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>            famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />            kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny<br />            now.<br />            if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />            fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />            fatty.<br />            does he come in secret seven?</p>

<p>        Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different<br />        from<br />        attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you have<br />        to<br />        read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />        children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />        caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />        course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />        book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is<br />        as<br />        far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any<br />        careers,<br />        all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers<br />        and<br />        boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that<br />        is<br />        British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>        The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />        years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />        France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did<br />        not<br />        find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>        Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />        sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is<br />        that<br />        she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love<br />        so<br />        very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse<br />        now<br />        and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />        time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>            PAvithra, yes Blyton is a great story teller, despite her<br />            unashamed<br />            racism :) My favorite is the Frederick Trotteville series what is<br />            yours ?</p>
<p>          Hi Maloo<br />          blyton racist?? its so far into the past i dont remember instances.</p>
<p>          my favourite was the one in which the lands change everyday abovea<br />          magic tree<br />          one land was the land of rhymes where you had to answer to every<br />          query<br />          with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>          famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />          kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny<br />          now.<br />          if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />          fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />          fatty.<br />          does he come in secret seven?</p>
<p>          of course after blyton boys branch out to hardy boys and girls to<br />          mills and boons.<br />          venketesh</p>

<p>        I think it is..and i felt the same..i was about 8th grade when i read<br />    it. My mother asked me immediately if the author is female, and then said<br />    that is what, she is writing about other women like that. There was another<br />    Blyton book 'Naughtiest girl in school' too very sexist stuff my mom asked<br />    again why not Naughtiest boy. But can't deny those books were fun to read.</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes is coming out from Hollywood soon with Robert Downey Jr in the lead. Holmes series is one that comes close to reading as many times <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  have read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym (though anything cannot beat that). Guess I have read it again as soon as I complete the current list at hand.</p>

<p>    It never occurred to me we could have fans of tintin in a fans' club of<br />    kalki. Tintin was my childhood hero and even now I luv to read tintin<br />    comics. Captain Haddock and snowy are my favourite characters - both invite<br />    trouble with a red carpet. Tintin actually inspired me to read other books<br />    to like amar chitra katha and GSEE Great stories in easy English seriestoo.<br />    I always wanted to own the entire collection of tintin; but managed to get<br />    5-6 of them so far. But I have lots of videos of tintin and have them in my<br />    Itouch. Don't know when I will go and splurge on the entire set of tintin<br />    books :))</p>
<p>    Famous five was "ok" with me. I liked it but never got quite fantacisedby<br />    it like the way amar chitra katha and tintin did.</p>
<p>    Rani comics was my other childhood favourite. Mayavi was a character I loved<br />    to read. But I recently read a rani comics and found it too trivial - may be<br />    I have grown up ! :).</p>
<p>    Any more fans of tintin or rani comics ?</p>

<p>    Venkat, Tintin racist? No i think some extreme thinkers might think so but<br />    overall unlike Blyton Tintin is very accepted all over the world and is<br />    considered a classic. Tintin is the only nonliving character to win the<br />    World Peace Award by the way :) There exists whole fan clubs, hotels and<br />    memorabilia dedicated to Tintin.</p>
<p>    I am a huge, very ardent fan, would love to know if other Tintin fans are<br />    there among the PSVP crowd. What is your favorite Tintin - mine is the<br />    Calculus Affair.</p>

<p>     You are right maloo.<br />     racism should be seen in literature taking into context the years it was<br />     written in.<br />     a book is a mirror of its times.<br />     now my other favourite tintin is accused of being racist</p>

<p>       Hi Venkat, Blyton is blatantly racist and sexist but no different from<br />       attitudes and writings of her time. To understand it better you haveto<br />       read her school books, Malory Towers and St Clares - almost all the<br />       children from other countries France, America, Africa and so on are<br />       caricatures and poor contrasts to the perfect British stereotypes. Of<br />       course Asian kids dont even deserve mention , there is one adventure<br />       book where there is an exotic brown guy magician named Uma. That is as<br />       far as she came as far as asians go. None of the girls have any careers,<br />       all of them grow up to be idealistic church going wives and mothers and<br />       boys have to protect and guard girls all the time. Of course all that is<br />       British is good and perfect.</p>
<p>       The Noddy series was edited to remove racist references about a few<br />       years ago. Blyton is disliked almost intensely in most of the States,<br />       France and Germany too - but given our own colonial history we did not<br />       find it objectionable but most people from other countries do.</p>
<p>       Her writing has been critqued heavily for lack of originality, short<br />       sentence construction and repeat usage of themes. The point also is that<br />       she was creative and appealed to the escapist stories children love so<br />       very much. Like Pavithra i have a few books from childhood i browse now<br />       and then and smile at the humor and memories they bring. There was a<br />       time when I thought these were classics but that is no longer there.</p>

<p>           PAvithra, yes Blyton is a great story teller, despite her unashamed<br />           racism :) My favorite is the Frederick Trotteville series what is<br />           yours ?</p>
<p>         Hi Maloo<br />         blyton racist?? its so far into the past i dont remember instances.</p>
<p>         my favourite was the one in which the lands change everyday above a<br />         magic tree<br />         one land was the land of rhymes where you had to answer to every query<br />         with a ryhming word.</p>
<p>         famous five ignited my interest in fiction. uncle quentin being<br />         kidnapped so often and georgina wanting to be a boy seems funny now.<br />         if you hadnt read the 21 books then it wasnt right at that age.<br />         fredricks middle name was alegron or something so he was called<br />         fatty.<br />         does he come in secret seven?</p>
<p>         of course after blyton boys branch out to hardy boys and girls to<br />         mills and boons.<br />         venketesh</p>

<p>           also reading<br />           AGATHA CHRITIE- the finished portrait<br />           this is about one of my favourite authors.mystery writer agatha<br />     christie<br />         vanished from her home and was missing for 11 days. this book is a<br />     full<br />         scale research on what may have happened during that period.</p>

<p>  2. When VD meets nandhini for the first time at PPV's palace and just<br />  before manthravadi comes in ?</p>
