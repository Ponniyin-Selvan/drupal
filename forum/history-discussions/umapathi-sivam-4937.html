<p>    and the "hotel kavitha" compound where he did all those savoury <br />  and <br />    unsavoury activities listed by vijay is just a road away from my <br />  home.</p>
<p>    the erstwhile hotel kavitha is a huge shady compound on one side <br />  of <br />    the alwarpet flyover. you can see it to the right once you cross <br />    lifestyle( the old one) <br />    thats where the best of his poetry came from.<br />    i would always equate it to the kuyil thoppu in pondichery where <br />  the <br />    mahakavi wrote.<br />    venketesh</p>

<p>I completely agree with you Venkatesh. But during 1978s or so, Kannadaasan realised and analysed about his earlier all works (as per his quote). He quotes in his one of 'ArthamuLLa indhumatham'series as follows: I met that man (who is living opposite to sun theatre and meeting after a gap of so many year) and he asked me you did not do any thing so for people and start do - After reaching home I received a call from Dinamani Kathir with an offer that I should start some series. so 'ArthamuLLa Indhumatham' started. More than cine songs, in his other works of writings He has excelled in every department of philasophy. He has scolded very badly about Rajaji during 50s but his Kavithai - IrangaRpaa on Rajaji's death brings out tear to every one. His own IrangaRpaa, was somewhat, no poet ever tried, he wrote, a beutiful Tamil garland. His translations on Baja govindham, his translation on Kanagadhara sthothram - what a contrast for both? Yet Kannadaasan won the hearts of every<br />reader.</p>
<p>Aviveka Sinthamani - a classic work of Kannadasan. After reading all his other than cinema works only I confessed that Kannadasan is also a sidhdhar.</p>
<p>www.vamsadhara.blogspot.com (April 2007) I have written a Tamil article in some Tamil groups about Kannadasan and Adhisankarar. You can browse.</p>

        <p>hi chief,</p>
<p>i am not a non believer...but that doesnt stop us from <br />introspecting. ekam Sataha Vipraha bahudha vadanti.....truth is but <br />one but we see it differently..</p>
<p>i am only arguing that the reason attributed to someone as lofty, <br />well read, crafty ( vicitrasithan!!)<br />undergoing a sea change in his core philosophy towards something as <br />pervasive as GOD...just because he witnessed a few `miracles' doesnt <br />just jell. at his level of intellect he would be asking as to which <br />path leads to godliness and not which god is more powerful. he would <br />have studied the tenets...heard both sides describe their ultimate <br />goals...there would have been a healthy debate....and then passed a <br />judgement. not just burn both the palm leaf and let the unburnt one <br />decide the victor.</p>
<p>not that i am saying everything must pass scientific tests but we <br />can atleast try scientific reasoning..am not disputing <br />miracles ....i know and understand that some are explainable with <br />the science as we know it now, some cannot. </p>
<p>take the case of the astras....in the mahabarta...the use of the <br />brahmastra...the final battle between arjuna and one of the eight <br />hindu immortals ( chiranjeevins)..ashvatama...the description goes <br />as ....when used it shines like a bolt of lightning brighter than <br />thousand suns shining together, a majestic cloud of light and dust, <br />so big that it will eclipse the sun and everything will be vaporised <br />as far as one can see, no blade of grass can grow for 12 years ( not <br />sure of this)....and so on...if someone wanted to describe the <br />destructive force of a weapon...he would just say it breaks <br />everything, burns everything etc...but the specific references to <br />pull/poondi not growing, the mushroom cloud etc ...point to <br />technology much advanced for its times.</p>

        <p>Hi<br />I always feel very proximal to kannadasan.though I have seen hm just <br />once from a distance of a few hundred metres.<br />the reason was <br />our native villages are just a few miles apart</p>
<p>and the "hotel kavitha" compound where he did all those savoury and <br />unsavoury activities listed by vijay is just a road away from my home.</p>
<p>the erstwhile hotel kavitha is a huge shady compound on one side of <br />the alwarpet flyover. you can see it to the right once you cross <br />lifestyle( the old one) <br />thats where the best of his poetry came from.<br />i would always equate it to the kuyil thoppu in pondichery where the <br />mahakavi wrote.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>      But constructing temples, naming after them are all for <br />future <br />    generation - and I can very well say that they have done right <br />    because following the footsteps, more such structures will arise <br />- <br />    all relegious places are meant for moral practice. Whether the <br />  kings <br />    publicise himself or not, they have helped the crores of people <br />to <br />    get solace from day to day problems. We will take POSITIVE side <br />  alone.</p>
<p>      composing verses on them: A leader always gets such things <br />  from <br />    their devoted servents. The king cannot ignore this. But the <br />great <br />    kings always knows how to take these things into their strides. <br />  RRC/<br />    RJC/KC probably - must have enjoyed that moment of praise - <br />that's <br />    all. If you read Jeyankondar's Kalingattu Parani - they poet <br />  praised <br />    the king too much and even praised him to the level of Krishna <br />and <br />    equalise chola country ladies as gopikaas.</p>
<p>      Great people always know their strength and weakness. When <br />  their <br />    sishyaas sing their strength, they accept for that momentum. When <br />    they exaggarate the same great people's weakness as their <br />  strength, <br />    they will laugh themselves. </p>
<p>      RRC still living through the structures and his deeds. And he <br />    will live for ever. This we should treat as a positive signal. </p>

<p>  I never knew that Kavaiarasar is also discussed in Ponniyin Selvan <br />groups.</p>

        <p>Hi sirs,</p>
<p>thanks for all the responses. However, i think i need to properly <br />phrase my question..once again</p>
<p>quote divakar sir,</p>
<p>She said people do not listen to such advises so these tricks are <br />necessary to take them towards righteous way of life. "</p>
<p>My question is exactly this</p>
<p>such tricks are used to grab the attn of the pamaran....but do our <br />kings also fall in the same criteria. </p>
<p>On one side we talk of kings raising lofty gopurams, building <br />fantastic idols...renaming themselves sps ( .....), even composing <br />verses ..... do they also fall under the same bracket...i dont think <br />so. </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Vijay, <br />Miracles do happen time and time and whenever it is necessary. But all these things only for experiencing and for 'loka-kalyaanam' not for advertising or for selfish things. </p>
<p>Our Guru used to tell one thing. - there is absolutely no need to God to show His power or to show Himself. But when Hiranya asked his son to show whether Narayana lives in his own built sthambam and if Narayana not present there in that particular sthambam, will prahalaatha accept the theory of Non-goddism but only Hiranyayisim ?- and when Prahalatha said a staunch Yes to his father's challenge, God Narayana got the necessity here to show Himself because of his devotee. God can have any number of non-beleivers BUT He will never loose a staunch devotee like Prahalatha. So the Miracle happened that he has shown Himself as omni-present AND EVEN IN THE EGOIST STHAMBAM of Hiranya.</p>
<p>(spitting out lingam) When I asked your question some times back to one Tamil Maathaji from Mumbai, who used to bring out kumkum and sandal powder by 'maya powers' - what is the necessary, and is it true, when it is true, from where. She replied positively but did not explain how. But Mathaaji accepted that this type of tricks not at all necessary if people listen to righteous way of life. She said people do not listen to such advises so these tricks are necessary to take them towards righteous way of life. </p>
<p>But severe saadhana will surely provide some unexplained inner powers - again our Guru says - those who utilise these powers for selfish motive - can not sustain long and in fact it will destroy them too.</p>
<p>I have seen some miracles myself but I have no scientific explanation - so better to keep with myself.</p>
<p>Our Tamil country was home to several siththars. One of my old friend M.Arunachalam, (Once a big contractor here at Vizag) now is called as 'saamiji' used to do penance at Rathnagiri Hills near Vellore. Now and then Saamiji will come to Vizag - and he will never show any such maaya things - since he is a friend of mine I used to take privilage and ask him about these type of miracles. He says these things are to be experienced and, can not be explained. He has experienced several type of 'sidhdhu vilaiyaattu' during his penance. He used to get from unseen pinches in shoulders and 'kuttu' on the top of his head. He says he used to take these things as blessing from the unknown sidhdhars.</p>
<p>If you read VaLLalaar varalaaru, will give more light on miracles.</p>
<p>Again to come to your point on Saivite-Jain miracles, Nile river turning red, etc., etc. - in my view, we will have to take the only lesson from those types of incidents that is 'satyamEva jayatE'. Vaaymai mattumE vellum. And God will be always siding with righteous people.</p>

        <p>On the question of miracles, I would like to add a small anecdote given<br />by Dada J. P. Vaswani, the spiritual leader of most of the Sindhis<br />living all over the world.</p>
<p>He frequently conducts question-answer sessions with school and college<br />students and youth. At the end of one such session, he asked the<br />participants (just before winding up) what they wanted, expecting a<br />question. A few of the girls shouted ice-creme. He did not know what to<br />do, but one of the Sindhis present, offered to sponsor ice creme for all<br />the young ones present. "This is a miracle I didn't expect," said Dada<br />Vaswani and gave (while ice creme was being arranged) several examples<br />of how even when simple wishes,if fulfilled in an unexpected way, become<br />miracles.</p>
<p>Occasions when personal problems are resolved in an unexpected manner,<br />are treated as miracles. A recent example of A R Rahman, his mother and<br />sister converting to Islam, could be labeled as a miracle (by him) when<br />his family's problems were sorted out by a Fakir.</p>
<p>I think, if your wish (cure of sicknesses, material benefit, rewards for<br />family members) is fulfilled, then it may be called a "miracle".</p>

        <p>hi divakar sir and sps sir,</p>
<p>Many thanks for the detailed explanations....god,gold, glory....will <br />oneday drive us to extinction..</p>
<p>a question to divakar sir,</p>
<p>whenever we look for spiritual conquests...shaivism over jainism <br />etc, we are also given stories of miracles ....of stomach aches, <br />miracle cure from illnes, verses not getting burnt, floating on <br />water etc..</p>
<p>even in other parallels, like the ten commandments ....the nile <br />turning red, hail etc. somehow these do not pass muster to <br />scientific reasoning, and need to be taken with a pinch of salt as <br />you would do when you see ...... spitting out a lingam.</p>
<p>We portray our kings with enormous wisdom, vision and tack. maybe <br />the comman man would have been naive enough, but how come even kings <br />swayed from their deep devotion to god and the higher plane ...by <br />these </p>
<p>on the otherside, the great saints, they were such exponents of <br />verse..who have communed with god ....were miracles the only way for <br />them to demonstrate that their god was more powerful</p>

<p>theevatti before the pallakku - as this was the custom. His guru who <br />was looking at this, making fun on Umapathi Sivam that ' see..a <br />'pakal-kurudu' is going in the pallakku. Hearing this word, Umapathi <br />Sivam got down to catch him but the guru was running fast towards <br />Kollidam. Umapathi too followed him and settled there with his Guru <br />and made an ashram, and started puja to a small Nataraja Vigraham <br />every day.</p>

<p>Actually I wanted to see this puja every time when I went that side, <br />some how not blessed.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Umapathi Sivam was also involved in a controversy at his ashram. <br />As per the written script from Nataraja to a wood-cutter to bless </p></blockquote>
<p>Mukthi through Acharya, when it was shown to Umapathi Sivam, he has <br />obeyed. The wood-cutter, fired by a light and ended into ashes - got <br />Mukthi - but his family, especially his wife charged against Acharya <br />that he has killed her husband by Maaya-yukthi. When the King was <br />informed, he himself came to Ashram asked the Acharya for his <br />explanation on the incident for which Umapathi Sivam simply explained <br />that this was an order of Nataraja. King said he and others can not <br />accept his explanation and he has to show a proof. On his request, in <br />front of him, Umpathi Sivam by praying Nataraja, without touching, <br />lighted a small plant in to ashes by sitting in his seat in the <br />Ashram. The King and others realised the fact.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The King - from Gangai Konda Cholapuram, may be 3rd Kulottunga - <br />which I am not sure.</p>

<p>  But it is more interesting from HISTORY point of View that <br />  MEYKANDAR's BIRTH PLACE is Nallur @ PANCHAVAN MADEVI CHATURVEDI <br />  MANGALAM ! - WHICH is just about 1 Km South of Sundara Perumal Koil <br />  @ Sundara Chozha Vinnagaram !</p>
<p>  Panchavanmadevi and Kundavai have given enormous grants to this <br />  temple !</p>
<p>  As predicted by Kudanthai Sethuraman's Kakkapujandar Naadi, a KAALI <br />  (believed to be worshipped by Kulothunga) was unearthed about 30 <br />  years back!</p>
<p>  In the underground chambers, several Bronzes were unearthed about <br />  30 / 40 years back.. Famous NALLUR NATARAJA was one among them.. It <br />  is now kept under lock and key by Sreelasri Thiruvavaduthurai <br />  Adheenam at Thiruvidaimaruthur temple ! I think we have the photo <br />  in our photo-section (Group Founder Ram has posted this photo some <br />  time back).</p>
<p>  We have discussed extensively on this temple .. another interesting <br />  fact:</p>
<p>  Siva Blessed Appar by putting his leg over Appar's Head ! </p>
<p>  Forerunner for dreaming of a Sivapaadha sekaran (by RRC)!</p>

<p>Umapathi Sivam was also involved in a controversy at his ashram. As per the written script from Nataraja to a wood-cutter to bless Mukthi through Acharya, when it was shown to Umapathi Sivam, he has obeyed. The wood-cutter, fired by a light and ended into ashes - got Mukthi - but his family, especially his wife charged against Acharya that he has killed her husband by Maaya-yukthi.

<p>As predicted by Kudanthai Sethuraman's Kakkapujandar Naadi, a KAALI <br />(believed to be worshipped by Kulothunga) was unearthed about 30 <br />years back!</p>
<p>In the underground chambers, several Bronzes were unearthed about <br />30 / 40 years back.. Famous NALLUR NATARAJA was one among them.. It <br />is now kept under lock and key by Sreelasri Thiruvavaduthurai <br />Adheenam at Thiruvidaimaruthur temple ! I think we have the photo <br />in our photo-section (Group Founder Ram has posted this photo some <br />time back).</p>
<p>We have discussed extensively on this temple .. another interesting <br />fact:</p>
<p>Siva Blessed Appar by putting his leg over Appar's Head ! </p>
<p>Forerunner for dreaming of a Sivapaadha sekaran (by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym )!</p>

<p>Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>Re CLASSIFICATION OF SAIVA THIRUMURAIs, Dr. Ma. Rasamanickanar <br />writes in his book Chozhar Varalaru (Page 208 )::</p>
<p>hymns existed. Prior to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  there were instances of Thevaram hymed <br />in temples:: ( 373 of 1903, 349 of 1918, 129 of 1914, 99 of 1929 and <br />139 of 1925.) </acronym></p>
<p>* It is Nambiandar Nambi who classified Thirugnanasambandas hymns <br />as 1,2and 3; Narukkarasar 4,5 and 6; and Sundarar as 7.</p>
<p>* Also refer during <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  period no Bronze was made for Manickavasagar.</p>
<p>* 48 Odhuvars employed in the Big temple for hymning Thiruppadhigams;</p>
<p>* BASED ON THE ABOVE LINE OF THINKING, PLS AGREE WITH "ULAGALANDHAN <br />PILLAI - vide Rajarajan I pp 100 - 105 - that IT WAS NOT UMAPATHY <br />SIVAM WHO COMPILED OR CLASSIFIED THIRUTHONDAR PURANAM. ( SUCH <br />COMPILING AND CLASSIFICATION TOOK PLACE DURING <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  PERIOD ITSELF)</p>
<p>Hope this serves some purpose.</p>
<p>regards/ sps</p></acronym></p>
