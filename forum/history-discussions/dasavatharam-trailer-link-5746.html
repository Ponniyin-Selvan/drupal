        <p>the very concept of killing of a entity that is beyond the compromise <br />of birth is not correct. When one is never born - there is no death.<br />Sarabeswarar - did something like a 'DATA TRANSFER' of all the rudric <br />amsam of Lord Narasmha.</p>
<p>The Lord was in no mood to get pacified - sarabeshwar was the form of <br />all the kodura rudra aamsam of the Lord narasimha himself.<br />-- an out of the box explanation.</p>
<p>-- Ravi</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /><satisharun@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  As far as I have heard, Sarabeswarar never killed Narasimha, but just <br />  controlled him from his anger. No one was able to pacify Narasimha <br />and <br />  hence prayed to Siva and siva took the form of Sarabeswarar and held <br />  Narasimha tight so that Narasimha could not move and then slowly <br />  calmed down. <br />  This sounds more logical than the story of Sarabeswarar killing <br />  Narasimha...</p>

        <p>As far as I have heard, Sarabeswarar never killed Narasimha, but just <br />controlled him from his anger. No one was able to pacify Narasimha and <br />hence prayed to Siva and siva took the form of Sarabeswarar and held <br />Narasimha tight so that Narasimha could not move and then slowly <br />calmed down. <br />This sounds more logical than the story of Sarabeswarar killing <br />Narasimha...</p>

<p>  I agree with you some stories may have been created<br />  for competitive reasons. Most stories are created to<br />  convey deeper spiritual truths. If we want to run this<br />  political contest in the name of Siva versus Vishnu -<br />  I will only take what 'rationally' makes sense and if<br />  it supports 'Vishnu' - it is not going to be unlike a<br />  political battle between rival political parties.<br />  Whether mature devotees, be it of Siva/Vishnu or any<br />  deity engage in that is a question for us all.</p>

<p>    For me, I would not believe the Sarabeswarar Story<br />    or the <br />    Pratyangira story and the vice versa, will be true<br />    for some one else.</p>

<p>    The above is very ideal, if everyone in the world<br />    understands the <br />    actual reasons, while considering the other<br />    characters as metaphors. <br />    But, as most people believe everything right from<br />    the characters to <br />    the intended objectives, one need to be careful in<br />    conveying only <br />    the correct, logical and rational things, rather<br />    than say something <br />    without a basis just for competition.</p>
<p>    One small question in this regard! Cholas were<br />    inherently ardent <br />    Saivites and either Thillai Natarajan or Thiruvaru<br />    Thyagarajan had <br />    been their first "kula deivam". It is also noted<br />    from the Ennayiram <br />    descriptions that Narasimha was indeed the "kula<br />    deivam" of <br />    Kulothunga I and many other Chola Kings. If the<br />    Sarabeswarar legend <br />    is true, then why would they want to have the<br />    Narasimha form of <br />    Vishnu as their kula deivam, as naturally their<br />    original kula deivam <br />    Siva had ostracised Narasimha form of Vishnu. The<br />    Logic here is <br />    begging. This is why I used the word "competition"<br />    above. If the <br />    motive was to exhibit the tolerance limits, they<br />    could have as well <br />    had other forms like Ranganatha or Venkateswara who<br />    had no records <br />    of Siva's interference. </p>
<p>    I leave it here. I had just indicated how I would<br />    carry on the <br />    discussion to turn down the Sarabeswarar legend,<br />    logically. I do not <br />    want to continue on this for the fear of hurting<br />    others and also it <br />    is not in the purview of this group which is<br />    basically to discuss on <br />    history.</p>

<p>        That is easily contested from a Vaishnavite<br />        Perspective. It was true <br />        that no one was even able to near Narasimha due<br />    to<br />        the heat <br />        generated due to His anger. It is said that even<br />        Lakshmi, who is the <br />        embodiment of Karunya, could not<br />        go near Her husband. Then every one prayed to<br />        Prahaladha himself to <br />        go forward and bring down the "ugram" of<br />    Narasimha.<br />        On seeing the <br />        innocent (did I say that?? Afterall he was the<br />        greatest Bhaktha) <br />        face of the child Prahaladha, (for whose cause,<br />        Vishnu took the <br />        Narasimha Avatar) Narasimha cooled down and only<br />        then Lakshmi was <br />        able to near Him.</p>
<p>        This is espoused in the ThiruvallikkENi pAsuram<br />    of<br />        Periya Thirumozhi <br />        by Thirumangai Azhwar.</p>
<p>        paLLiyil Odhi vandthan than siRuvan vAyil Or<br />    Ayira<br />        nAmam<br />        oLLiyavAgi pOdha Angadhanukku, onRumOr<br />    poRuppilanAgi<br />        piLLaiyaicheeri venguNdu thooNpudhaippa,<br />        piRayeiRRanal vizhipEzhwAi<br />        theLLia singamAgiya thEvai thiruvallikkENi<br />    kaNDEnE!!</p>
<p>        Azhwar, as evident from the pAsuram above,<br />    clearly<br />        says that <br />        the "Ugra simham" became "theLLia singam" due to<br />        Prahaladha. </p>
<p>        Again I dont want to contest a tale here, but<br />    the<br />        SthalapuraNams. <br />        The reason is the happening of a tale is a 50-50<br />        probability based <br />        on the beliefs of the individual, but the<br />        sthalapuraNams never go <br />        well with the History. One will notice that 95%<br />    of<br />        the kings <br />        mentioned in a sthalapuranam will never find a<br />        mention anywhere in <br />        History. There are a very handful of<br />    divyadesams,<br />        whose <br />        sthalapuranams are atleast closer if not exactly<br />        matching with <br />        History. Srirangam for one is much better as can<br />    be<br />        seen from the <br />        Temple Chronicles called the "Koil Ozhugu". </p>

<p>      That is easily contested from a Vaishnavite<br />      Perspective. It was true <br />      that no one was even able to near Narasimha due<br />  to<br />      the heat <br />      generated due to His anger. It is said that even<br />      Lakshmi, who is the <br />      embodiment of Karunya, could not<br />      go near Her husband. Then every one prayed to<br />      Prahaladha himself to <br />      go forward and bring down the "ugram" of<br />  Narasimha.<br />      On seeing the <br />      innocent (did I say that?? Afterall he was the<br />      greatest Bhaktha) <br />      face of the child Prahaladha, (for whose cause,<br />      Vishnu took the <br />      Narasimha Avatar) Narasimha cooled down and only<br />      then Lakshmi was <br />      able to near Him.</p>
<p>      This is espoused in the ThiruvallikkENi pAsuram<br />  of<br />      Periya Thirumozhi <br />      by Thirumangai Azhwar.</p>
<p>      paLLiyil Odhi vandthan than siRuvan vAyil Or<br />  Ayira<br />      nAmam<br />      oLLiyavAgi pOdha Angadhanukku, onRumOr<br />  poRuppilanAgi<br />      piLLaiyaicheeri venguNdu thooNpudhaippa,<br />      piRayeiRRanal vizhipEzhwAi<br />      theLLia singamAgiya thEvai thiruvallikkENi<br />  kaNDEnE!!</p>
<p>      Azhwar, as evident from the pAsuram above,<br />  clearly<br />      says that <br />      the "Ugra simham" became "theLLia singam" due to<br />      Prahaladha. </p>
<p>      Again I dont want to contest a tale here, but<br />  the<br />      SthalapuraNams. <br />      The reason is the happening of a tale is a 50-50<br />      probability based <br />      on the beliefs of the individual, but the<br />      sthalapuraNams never go <br />      well with the History. One will notice that 95%<br />  of<br />      the kings <br />      mentioned in a sthalapuranam will never find a<br />      mention anywhere in <br />      History. There are a very handful of<br />  divyadesams,<br />      whose <br />      sthalapuranams are atleast closer if not exactly<br />      matching with <br />      History. Srirangam for one is much better as can<br />  be<br />      seen from the <br />      Temple Chronicles called the "Koil Ozhugu". </p>

<p>Dearest V. Venkatesh,</p>
<p>PLEASE .. REPEAT PLEASE .. READ THE DETAILS FURNISHED EARLIER..</p>
<p>Kulothunga II helped Publication of Jeevaga Sinthamani and wanted to <br />adopt Jainism..</p>
<p>Kulothunga II was positioned in Gangai Konda Cholapuram according to <br />SRB..</p>
<p>We have recent finds (post 1980 - through Esalam investigations) <br />that KULOTHUNGA II operated from ENNAYIRAM..and that is how more <br />attention was drawn to Ennayiram to study of these Emperors.</p>
<p>Shree Vaishnavashree has quoted ENNAYIRAM inscriptions in <br />Panchajanyam based on these details only ..</p>
<p>Kundrathur ( About 10 Km west of Chennai - Porur Ramachandra Medical <br />College) Sekkizhar was an OFFICIAL ( not Minister) when approached <br />Kulothunga II to look into Nayanar episodes as depicted in <br />Thiruthondar thogai..</p>
<p>Thiruthondar Thogai - by Sundarar - has Chidambaram connections.  <br />Cheramanperumal was directed to contact Sundarar (in Thiruvarur) <br />when approahced from Vanchi (Kerala) by Nataraja (by Asariri).</p>
<p>So Kundrathur Sekkzhiar visited chidambaram (A 2nd year  <br />inscription of Kulothunga II describes Sekkizhar just in plain <br />terms as above !) and worked on compiling the PURANAM.. </p>
<p>Which was later on known as Periya puranam..</p>
<p>Umpathi Sivachariar wrote in detail THE MAKING OF PERIYAPURANAM BY <br />SEKKIZHAR as SEKKIZHAR PURANAM !!!</p>
<p>As you are aware " Periyapuranam " is glorifying the Thondars <br />irrespective of their social status.. !</p>
<p>Kulothuna VISITED chimdabaram (from elsewhere), honoured Sekkizhar, <br />spent ONE FULL YEAR .. when Sekkizhar described verse after verse !!<br />and then Sekkziahr became the Minister !!</p>
<p>We speculate this Kulothunga II to have thrown a Bigsize <br />Sayanaperumal into the Sea because of two line mention by <br />Ottakuthar !! ~ with That Sekkizhar holding Ministry !</p>
<p>In the light please read more on Kulothunga II.</p>
<p>PRIMARILY this discussion has caused almost each one of us to <br />revisit most of the REVERED RELIGEIOUS TEXTS ..and Cherish again.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone.</p>

<p>      One small question in this regard! Cholas were inherently <br />  ardent <br />      Saivites and either Thillai Natarajan or Thiruvaru Thyagarajan <br />  had <br />      been their first "kula deivam". It is also noted from the <br />  Ennayiram <br />      descriptions that Narasimha was indeed the "kula deivam" of <br />      Kulothunga I and many other Chola Kings. </p>

        <p>Mr Vijay,</p>
<p>Indeed it is Narasimha. But it is only Kulothunga I, who is the <br />cross-over from Chalukyas to Cholas. Apparently, his successors <br />would definitely have been caught up with the Chola culture and <br />hence it is no wonder that Kulothunga II could very well have <br />transformed into a staunch Saivite with lesser tolerance levels. <br />Afterall history has recorded so many conversions starting from <br />Mahendravarman to Nedunchadayan to Hoysala Vishnuvardhanan et al, at <br />some point of time.</p>
<p>However, you taken a para out of a discussion on Sarabeswarar legend <br />to quote here. How does this relate to the authenticity of the <br />Sarabeswarar legend, either historically or logically?</p>

        <p>Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>Precisely, that is why I started my reply saying "this is easily <br />contested from a Vaishnavite perspective" and did not start <br />with "Sorry you are wrong and the truth is....."</p>
<p>For me, I would not believe the Sarabeswarar Story or the <br />Pratyangira story and the vice versa, will be true for some one else.</p>
<p>===================Quote===================<br />the point is that the</p>
<blockquote><p>  story has something to say about ourselves regarding<br />  anger and pacification.<br />=================Unquote================</p></blockquote>
<p>The above is very ideal, if everyone in the world understands the <br />actual reasons, while considering the other characters as metaphors. <br />But, as most people believe everything right from the characters to <br />the intended objectives, one need to be careful in conveying only <br />the correct, logical and rational things, rather than say something <br />without a basis just for competition.</p>
<p>One small question in this regard! Cholas were inherently ardent <br />Saivites and either Thillai Natarajan or Thiruvaru Thyagarajan had <br />been their first "kula deivam". It is also noted from the Ennayiram <br />descriptions that Narasimha was indeed the "kula deivam" of <br />Kulothunga I and many other Chola Kings. If the Sarabeswarar legend <br />is true, then why would they want to have the Narasimha form of <br />Vishnu as their kula deivam, as naturally their original kula deivam <br />Siva had ostracised Narasimha form of Vishnu. The Logic here is <br />begging. This is why I used the word "competition" above. If the <br />motive was to exhibit the tolerance limits, they could have as well <br />had other forms like Ranganatha or Venkateswara who had no records <br />of Siva's interference. </p>
<p>I leave it here. I had just indicated how I would carry on the <br />discussion to turn down the Sarabeswarar legend, logically. I do not <br />want to continue on this for the fear of hurting others and also it <br />is not in the purview of this group which is basically to discuss on <br />history.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Venkat2, my humble stance is that 'sthala puranam' and<br />  history can be totally unrelated. The basic problem in<br />  our times is that there is only ONE way of<br />  understanding everything - that is if it<br />  historically/literally happened, the opposite of any<br />  literal truth is a lie, in fact it is a sad problem of<br />  modern times that even the word 'myth' itself often<br />  means a lie. Myth is not a lie, myth is an allegorical<br />  truth, or a story written to communicate truths that<br />  do not go well if we say in plain literal forms.</p>
<p>  Spiritual gurus/masters often used myths or<br />  allegorical truths to communicate great wisdom.<br />  Whether Narasimha was pacified by Shiva or Prahlada<br />  himself is hardly the point, the point is that the<br />  story has something to say about ourselves regarding<br />  anger and pacification.</p>
<p>  This link offers what James Joyce thought on Ulysses,<br />  a western myth, in a similar way.<br />  <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/stories/2007060350260200.htm" title="http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/stories/2007060350260200.htm">http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/stories/2007060350260200.htm</a></p>
<p>  It offends orthodox religious believers and unorthodox<br />  people who enjoy fighting these things that it need<br />  not be a literal truth. But as long as we stick to<br />  saying it is literal (because we think all non<br />  literals are lies) we will be left with such dilemmas<br />  that is all.</p>

<p>    Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>    That is easily contested from a Vaishnavite<br />    Perspective. It was true <br />    that no one was even able to near Narasimha due to<br />    the heat <br />    generated due to His anger. It is said that even<br />    Lakshmi, who is the <br />    embodiment of Karunya, could not<br />    go near Her husband. Then every one prayed to<br />    Prahaladha himself to <br />    go forward and bring down the "ugram" of Narasimha.<br />    On seeing the <br />    innocent (did I say that?? Afterall he was the<br />    greatest Bhaktha) <br />    face of the child Prahaladha, (for whose cause,<br />    Vishnu took the <br />    Narasimha Avatar) Narasimha cooled down and only<br />    then Lakshmi was <br />    able to near Him.</p>
<p>    This is espoused in the ThiruvallikkENi pAsuram of<br />    Periya Thirumozhi <br />    by Thirumangai Azhwar.</p>
<p>    paLLiyil Odhi vandthan than siRuvan vAyil Or Ayira<br />    nAmam<br />    oLLiyavAgi pOdha Angadhanukku, onRumOr poRuppilanAgi<br />    piLLaiyaicheeri venguNdu thooNpudhaippa,<br />    piRayeiRRanal vizhipEzhwAi<br />    theLLia singamAgiya thEvai thiruvallikkENi kaNDEnE!!</p>
<p>    Azhwar, as evident from the pAsuram above, clearly<br />    says that <br />    the "Ugra simham" became "theLLia singam" due to<br />    Prahaladha. </p>
<p>    Again I dont want to contest a tale here, but the<br />    SthalapuraNams. <br />    The reason is the happening of a tale is a 50-50<br />    probability based <br />    on the beliefs of the individual, but the<br />    sthalapuraNams never go <br />    well with the History. One will notice that 95% of<br />    the kings <br />    mentioned in a sthalapuranam will never find a<br />    mention anywhere in <br />    History. There are a very handful of divyadesams,<br />    whose <br />    sthalapuranams are atleast closer if not exactly<br />    matching with <br />    History. Srirangam for one is much better as can be<br />    seen from the <br />    Temple Chronicles called the "Koil Ozhugu". </p>

<p>      Venkat2, whatever little I know from my<br />    grandmother,<br />      Narasimha's anger was not appeased even after<br />    killing<br />      Hiranya so Parvati or Shiva decided to confront<br />    the<br />      lion (not exactly Vishnu). </p>
<p>      I agree with what you say that many stories may<br />    have<br />      been invented as marketing tactics for the temple.<br />      There are several stories like that about Shiva<br />    too<br />      (The mohini basmasura tale where Shiva takes<br />    refuge in<br />      Vishnu to save him).</p>
<p>      Personally I have found them interesting and<br />    useful<br />      for their morals and similes to some situation<br />      spiritual or otherwise.If we look at them as<br />      independant tales not some correlation on a<br />    larger<br />      scale it may make some sense.</p>

<p>        Mr Vijay</p>
<p>        You share my thoughts too. The stories of Vishnu<br />        getting ostracised <br />        by Siva, in the Sarabeshwarar or<br />    ThiruvIzhimizhalai<br />        legend and vice <br />        versa are, in my humble opinion, at best<br />    fictitious.<br />        I, for one, do <br />        not want to believe these Sthala Puranams, which<br />        associates an <br />        ancient Puranam, for even a temple built as<br />    recently<br />        as 150 years <br />        ago. </p>
<p>        I was watching the Jaya TV sometime back and<br />    they<br />        were showing about <br />        the Mannargudi Rajagopala Swamy temple. It is<br />    very<br />        well know that it <br />        was built during the times of Kulothunga I and<br />    he<br />        built it during <br />        his "kADu thiruthi nADu paDuthum paNi". But<br />        immediately the presenter <br />        started associating some PuraNa which did<br />    mention<br />        about a PerumAL <br />        being present there. How!!!??? How in the world<br />    is<br />        this possible. </p>
<p>        Like wise the Sarabeswarar legend is very funny.<br />    It<br />        is said that Siva <br />        took the form of Sarabeswarar to kill Vishnu.<br />    First<br />        of all what is <br />        the motive? Afterall Vishnu took the form of<br />        Narasimha to protect his <br />        own devotee, Prahaladha. He did achieve His<br />    mission.<br />        What was the <br />        need of Siva to kill Him? Okay let us ascribe<br />    some<br />        motive and accept <br />        it for argument sake. Off late, we can see the<br />        legend of Pratyangira <br />        becoming famous and more with the visits of<br />    ex-CM JJ<br />        to the temple in <br />        Sholinganallur. The legend behind Pratyangira is<br />        that, Parvathi or <br />        Kaali took the form of Female lion and killed<br />        Narasimha. My God!!! If <br />        the husband has killed a person earlier, why<br />    would<br />        the wife need to <br />        take another form to kill the same person and<br />    again<br />        what is the <br />        motive. Or did Parvathi kill a "dead snake"? </p>
<p>        It is just that our ancestors who framed all<br />    these<br />        stories wanted to <br />        ascribe some antiquity to all these stories by<br />    way<br />        of a SthalapurANam <br />        so that the temple can be glorified. Really<br />    funny<br />        marketing tactics.</p>
<p>        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>
<p>        PS: Just for the records, the number of<br />        Sthalapuranams of Vaishnavite <br />        temples that associate Siva with it are too less<br />        compared to that of <br />        the Saivite temples that associate Vishnu with<br />        worshipping Siva at <br />        those temples.

        <p>Mr Venketesh,</p>
<p>I agree with you here on the Karmic inclinations. But how does that <br />lead to a pessimistic view. I only said that no one opposes anything <br />and keep silent. I never said that it is right or wrong, though I <br />used the word insensitive. It is but true that the internal karmic <br />dependance, exhibits externally as insensitiveness. Hope I am <br />clarifying my point. </p>
<p>In fact, philosophically I would say that these insensitive acts of <br />the Vaishnavites and in particular the Thenkalai Vaishnavites are <br />very true to their scriptures as they live the "bhAvam" of "pORRuvAr <br />pORRalum, thURRuvAr thURRalum pOgaTTum kaNNanukkE..". Yes as per the <br />Thenkalai Sampradhayam, there is nothing that a Jeevatma does to <br />earn anything and it is all what He does. Though at the outset is <br />may look like, everyone follows this and not only the Thenkalai <br />Vaishnavites. But the hairline difference is that others do <br />associate "some effort" on the part of jeevAthma, while according to <br />the Thenkalai philosophy even this "some effort" on the part of <br />jeevAthma is refuted. Remember the song from the film Marupadium</p>
<p>.... nAyakan mElirundhu nUlinai AattugindRAn, nAmellAm bommai enRu <br />nAdagam kAttuginRAn...</p>
<p>Now regarding the correctness of the above philosophy, though I can <br />debate on it, I am sure it will not be in the interest of the group. <br />So let us leave it at that, I mean, that it is the scriptures that <br />the Thenkalais follow. </p>
<p>So, in my humble opinion, calling a spade a spade (contextually here <br />the "insensitivity") cannot be termed as pessimism.</p>
<p>Humbly yours,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>  HI</p>
<p>  the above statement is quite pessimistic.<br />  hinduism is a great religion and doent need its bakthas to do <br />great <br />  sacrifices.<br />  our problem is a over dependence on the karma.<br />  when wrong happens around us we think its just what we deserve,</p>
<p>  but then finally the good does triumph over the bad<br />  see the "optimistic view point"</p>

<p>    I agree with you on the rest as you said regarding the <br />proportions <br />  of <br />    the Govindaraja shrine.</p>

<p>      -Hi</p>
<p>      good.<br />      but i dont share your pessimistic view.</p>
<p>      first of all since i am associated with the chidambaram temple <br />  for <br />      quite some time i know it evokes more emotions than mny others.</p>
<p>the <br />  very<br />        incident itself, inspite of Ottakoothar confirming it with <br />his<br />        ThakkayAgabharani. </p>
<p>      dont you beleive poets. they end up saying something else when <br />  they <br />      mean other things.</p>
<p>      i have a very great beleif in the similarities between <br />  thiruvengadu <br />      and chidambaram. <br />      the previous one near the confluence of kaveri and the sea is <br />    called <br />      aadi chidambaram and is mentioned by valmiki as swetharanyam<br />      the re is also a natrajar there in a similar shrine of almost <br />the <br />      same dimensions (but right now his importance is taken away by <br />    agora <br />      murthy.</p>
<p>      the temple also has a kali with a broken neck as a result of <br />a <br />      difficult move in a dance competition with shiva)<br />      what I am arrving at is at some point the structure of this <br />  temple <br />      and chidambaram must have been very alike.<br />      the temple complex also has a vishnu shrine. a small one.<br />      i guess the original shrine in thillai must have also been of <br />the <br />      same proportions and in the outer parikrama ( where the <br />    mulattanavar <br />      is also present)<br />      there seems no opposition when achuta rayar re installed a new <br />      govindaraja within the outer parikrama in 1530 or so. the <br />      dheekshithars must have been thankful that vijaynagar built <br />for <br />    them <br />      a rajagopuram and repaired the whole temple.<br />      it was when the kondama naicken tried to do it in the inner <br />    parikrama <br />      that they have protested.<br />      also if you observe the structure of the temples in thillai <br />you <br />    will <br />      feel the architecture is a little unbalanced and lopsided.<br />      where natraja faces south what must have been a wide hall in <br />  front  <br />      of him, only half exists. the other half taken by the govinda <br />  rajar <br />      shrine.<br />      i guess the original govindarajar must have been where the <br />  thaayar <br />      shrine is now very next to the very important nadana sabhai.<br />      also the only side with a walled up entrance is next to this . <br />  the <br />      south entrance to the main temple is walled up for some <br />reason. <br />  it <br />      even has a nandi outside.<br />      so chidambaram temple must be holding more secrets than those <br />  that <br />      will be unraveled in our life times.<br />      i will add a sketch of the inner shrine in our pictures folder <br />  soon.<br />      regards<br />      venketesh</p>
<p>      And regarding the Vaishnavite followers <br />      following<br />        suit, you can see very well today how many vaishnavites gave <br />  their<br />        voices for the Rama sethu Issue and similar issues. They <br />(we) <br />  are <br />      a very<br />        silent group, for whom "rAman AndAlum rAvaNan Andalum oru <br />    kavalayum<br />        illa.." [:D] The most insensitive group I would say. Like <br />  wise, <br />      those<br />        Vaishnavites also would have stood on the road sides and <br />cried <br />      out. A<br />        Ramanuja or A Koorathazhwan or A Periya Nambi and a similar <br />few <br />      are all<br />        but exception to this. Also from the date line of 1127 AD <br />when <br />    this<br />        incident is supposed to have happened Ramanuja was already <br />old <br />  at <br />      110<br />        years of age and Koorathazhwan had passed away. So we can <br />only <br />      expect<br />        the Vaishnvaites to follow, but CANNOT CONCLUDE.</p>
<p>        And for the records I am not disagreeing with the <br />probability <br />  of a<br />        similar character like Rangaraja Nambi to have existed. Only <br />  that <br />      it<br />        finds no record in the history.</p>

<p>          Hi</p>
<p>          so what venkatesh????<br />          fiction writers are given a huge allowance<br />          the reason we are all here is because of kalki and didnt <br />he <br />    make <br />      a<br />          great use of that licence.<br />          imagine a flower boy and a boat girl on karikalans <br />throne.it <br />      happened<br />          in ponniyin selvan.</p>
<p>          IF govindarajar was thrown into the sea i am sure a lot of <br />his<br />          vaishnavite followers would have followed suit. either <br />      voluntarily or<br />          by force.<br />          the dikshithar suicides 400 years later in the sameplace <br />is an<br />          example of those cruel times.</p>
<p>          i am sure there must have been atleast one person like <br />kamal's<br />          charecter. and from the accounts of sri vaishnavism that i <br />  know <br />      there<br />          is no dearth of dedicated followers. kamal has not gone <br />  against <br />      the<br />          spirit of the event.</p>
<p>          what we were discussing here was the background settings. <br />    before <br />      it<br />          became one of the most knowledgable discussions of the <br />event.<br />          venketesh</p>

<p>            That is precisely what I said as, the Rangaraja Nambi <br />    character<br />            finds no mention in any of the Traditional <br />Srivaishnavite <br />      accounts.<br />            He is very correct.</p>

        <p>Venkat2, my humble stance is that 'sthala puranam' and<br />history can be totally unrelated. The basic problem in<br />our times is that there is only ONE way of<br />understanding everything - that is if it<br />historically/literally happened, the opposite of any<br />literal truth is a lie, in fact it is a sad problem of<br />modern times that even the word 'myth' itself often<br />means a lie. Myth is not a lie, myth is an allegorical<br />truth, or a story written to communicate truths that<br />do not go well if we say in plain literal forms.</p>
<p>Spiritual gurus/masters often used myths or<br />allegorical truths to communicate great wisdom.<br />Whether Narasimha was pacified by Shiva or Prahlada<br />himself is hardly the point, the point is that the<br />story has something to say about ourselves regarding<br />anger and pacification.</p>
<p>This link offers what James Joyce thought on Ulysses,<br />a western myth, in a similar way.<br /><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/stories/2007060350260200.htm" title="http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/stories/2007060350260200.htm">http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2007/06/03/stories/2007060350260200.htm</a></p>
<p>It offends orthodox religious believers and unorthodox<br />people who enjoy fighting these things that it need<br />not be a literal truth. But as long as we stick to<br />saying it is literal (because we think all non<br />literals are lies) we will be left with such dilemmas<br />that is all.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>  That is easily contested from a Vaishnavite<br />  Perspective. It was true <br />  that no one was even able to near Narasimha due to<br />  the heat <br />  generated due to His anger. It is said that even<br />  Lakshmi, who is the <br />  embodiment of Karunya, could not<br />  go near Her husband. Then every one prayed to<br />  Prahaladha himself to <br />  go forward and bring down the "ugram" of Narasimha.<br />  On seeing the <br />  innocent (did I say that?? Afterall he was the<br />  greatest Bhaktha) <br />  face of the child Prahaladha, (for whose cause,<br />  Vishnu took the <br />  Narasimha Avatar) Narasimha cooled down and only<br />  then Lakshmi was <br />  able to near Him.</p>
<p>  This is espoused in the ThiruvallikkENi pAsuram of<br />  Periya Thirumozhi <br />  by Thirumangai Azhwar.</p>
<p>  paLLiyil Odhi vandthan than siRuvan vAyil Or Ayira<br />  nAmam<br />  oLLiyavAgi pOdha Angadhanukku, onRumOr poRuppilanAgi<br />  piLLaiyaicheeri venguNdu thooNpudhaippa,<br />  piRayeiRRanal vizhipEzhwAi<br />  theLLia singamAgiya thEvai thiruvallikkENi kaNDEnE!!</p>
<p>  Azhwar, as evident from the pAsuram above, clearly<br />  says that <br />  the "Ugra simham" became "theLLia singam" due to<br />  Prahaladha. </p>
<p>  Again I dont want to contest a tale here, but the<br />  SthalapuraNams. <br />  The reason is the happening of a tale is a 50-50<br />  probability based <br />  on the beliefs of the individual, but the<br />  sthalapuraNams never go <br />  well with the History. One will notice that 95% of<br />  the kings <br />  mentioned in a sthalapuranam will never find a<br />  mention anywhere in <br />  History. There are a very handful of divyadesams,<br />  whose <br />  sthalapuranams are atleast closer if not exactly<br />  matching with <br />  History. Srirangam for one is much better as can be<br />  seen from the <br />  Temple Chronicles called the "Koil Ozhugu". </p>

<p>    Venkat2, whatever little I know from my<br />  grandmother,<br />    Narasimha's anger was not appeased even after<br />  killing<br />    Hiranya so Parvati or Shiva decided to confront<br />  the<br />    lion (not exactly Vishnu). </p>
<p>    I agree with what you say that many stories may<br />  have<br />    been invented as marketing tactics for the temple.<br />    There are several stories like that about Shiva<br />  too<br />    (The mohini basmasura tale where Shiva takes<br />  refuge in<br />    Vishnu to save him).</p>
<p>    Personally I have found them interesting and<br />  useful<br />    for their morals and similes to some situation<br />    spiritual or otherwise.If we look at them as<br />    independant tales not some correlation on a<br />  larger<br />    scale it may make some sense.</p>

<p>      Mr Vijay</p>
<p>      You share my thoughts too. The stories of Vishnu<br />      getting ostracised <br />      by Siva, in the Sarabeshwarar or<br />  ThiruvIzhimizhalai<br />      legend and vice <br />      versa are, in my humble opinion, at best<br />  fictitious.<br />      I, for one, do <br />      not want to believe these Sthala Puranams, which<br />      associates an <br />      ancient Puranam, for even a temple built as<br />  recently<br />      as 150 years <br />      ago. </p>
<p>      I was watching the Jaya TV sometime back and<br />  they<br />      were showing about <br />      the Mannargudi Rajagopala Swamy temple. It is<br />  very<br />      well know that it <br />      was built during the times of Kulothunga I and<br />  he<br />      built it during <br />      his "kADu thiruthi nADu paDuthum paNi". But<br />      immediately the presenter <br />      started associating some PuraNa which did<br />  mention<br />      about a PerumAL <br />      being present there. How!!!??? How in the world<br />  is<br />      this possible. </p>
<p>      Like wise the Sarabeswarar legend is very funny.<br />  It<br />      is said that Siva <br />      took the form of Sarabeswarar to kill Vishnu.<br />  First<br />      of all what is <br />      the motive? Afterall Vishnu took the form of<br />      Narasimha to protect his <br />      own devotee, Prahaladha. He did achieve His<br />  mission.<br />      What was the <br />      need of Siva to kill Him? Okay let us ascribe<br />  some<br />      motive and accept <br />      it for argument sake. Off late, we can see the<br />      legend of Pratyangira <br />      becoming famous and more with the visits of<br />  ex-CM JJ<br />      to the temple in <br />      Sholinganallur. The legend behind Pratyangira is<br />      that, Parvathi or <br />      Kaali took the form of Female lion and killed<br />      Narasimha. My God!!! If <br />      the husband has killed a person earlier, why<br />  would<br />      the wife need to <br />      take another form to kill the same person and<br />  again<br />      what is the <br />      motive. Or did Parvathi kill a "dead snake"? </p>
<p>      It is just that our ancestors who framed all<br />  these<br />      stories wanted to <br />      ascribe some antiquity to all these stories by<br />  way<br />      of a SthalapurANam <br />      so that the temple can be glorified. Really<br />  funny<br />      marketing tactics.</p>
<p>      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh</p>
<p>      PS: Just for the records, the number of<br />      Sthalapuranams of Vaishnavite <br />      temples that associate Siva with it are too less<br />      compared to that of <br />      the Saivite temples that associate Vishnu with<br />      worshipping Siva at <br />      those temples. Do we get some insight into<br />  this??</p>

<p>  HI</p>
<p>  the above statement is quite pessimistic.<br />  hinduism is a great religion and doent need its<br />  bakthas to do great <br />  sacrifices.<br />  our problem is a over dependence on the karma.<br />  when wrong happens around us we think its just what<br />  we deserve,</p>
<p>  but then finally the good does triumph over the bad<br />  see the "optimistic view point"</p>
<p>  venketesh</p>
<p>    I agree with you on the rest as you said regarding<br />  the proportions <br />  of <br />    the Govindaraja shrine.</p>

<p>      -Hi</p>
<p>      good.<br />      but i dont share your pessimistic view.</p>
<p>      first of all since i am associated with the<br />  chidambaram temple <br />  for <br />      quite some time i know it evokes more emotions<br />  than mny others.</p>
<p>  are doubting the <br />  very<br />        incident itself, inspite of Ottakoothar<br />  confirming it with his<br />        ThakkayAgabharani. </p>
<p>      dont you beleive poets. they end up saying<br />  something else when <br />  they <br />      mean other things.</p>
<p>      i have a very great beleif in the similarities<br />  between <br />  thiruvengadu <br />      and chidambaram. <br />      the previous one near the confluence of kaveri<br />  and the sea is <br />    called <br />      aadi chidambaram and is mentioned by valmiki as<br />  swetharanyam<br />      the re is also a natrajar there in a similar<br />  shrine of almost the <br />      same dimensions (but right now his importance is<br />  taken away by <br />    agora <br />      murthy.</p>
<p>      the temple also has a kali with a broken neck <br />  as a result of a <br />      difficult move in a dance competition with<br />  shiva)<br />      what I am arrving at is at some point the<br />  structure of this <br />  temple <br />      and chidambaram must have been very alike.<br />      the temple complex also has a vishnu shrine. a<br />  small one.<br />      i guess the original shrine in thillai must have<br />  also been of the <br />      same proportions and in the outer parikrama (<br />  where the <br />    mulattanavar <br />      is also present)<br />      there seems no opposition when achuta rayar re<br />  installed a new <br />      govindaraja within the outer parikrama in 1530<br />  or so. the <br />      dheekshithars must have been thankful that<br />  vijaynagar built for <br />    them <br />      a rajagopuram and repaired the whole temple.<br />      it was when the kondama naicken tried to do it<br />  in the inner <br />    parikrama <br />      that they have protested.<br />      also if you observe the structure of the temples<br />  in thillai you <br />    will <br />      feel the architecture is a little unbalanced and<br />  lopsided.<br />      where natraja faces south what must have been a<br />  wide hall in <br />  front <br />      of him, only half exists. the other half taken<br />  by the govinda <br />  rajar <br />      shrine.<br />      i guess the original govindarajar must have been<br />  where the <br />  thaayar <br />      shrine is now very next to the very important<br />  nadana sabhai.<br />      also the only side with a walled up entrance is<br />  next to this . <br />  the <br />      south entrance to the main temple is walled up<br />  for some reason. <br />  it <br />      even has a nandi outside.<br />      so chidambaram temple must be holding more<br />  secrets than those <br />  that <br />      will be unraveled in our life times.<br />      i will add a sketch of the inner shrine in our<br />  pictures folder <br />  soon.<br />      regards<br />      venketesh</p>
<p>      And regarding the Vaishnavite followers <br />      following<br />        suit, you can see very well today how many<br />  vaishnavites gave <br />  their<br />        voices for the Rama sethu Issue and similar<br />  issues. They (we) <br />  are <br />      a very<br />        silent group, for whom "rAman AndAlum rAvaNan<br />  Andalum oru <br />    kavalayum<br />        illa.." [:D] The most insensitive group I<br />  would say. Like <br />  wise, <br />      those<br />        Vaishnavites also would have stood on the road<br />  sides and cried <br />      out. A<br />        Ramanuja or A Koorathazhwan or A Periya Nambi<br />  and a similar few <br />      are all<br />        but exception to this. Also from the date line<br />  of 1127 AD when <br />    this<br />        incident is supposed to have happened Ramanuja<br />  was already old <br />  at <br />      110<br />        years of age and Koorathazhwan had passed<br />  away. So we can only <br />      expect<br />        the Vaishnvaites to follow, but CANNOT<br />  CONCLUDE.</p>
<p>        And for the records I am not disagreeing with<br />  the probability <br />  of a<br />        similar character like Rangaraja Nambi to have<br />  existed. Only <br />  that <br />      it<br />        finds no record in the history.</p>

<p>HI</p>
<p>the above statement is quite pessimistic.<br />hinduism is a great religion and doent need its bakthas to do great <br />sacrifices.<br />our problem is a over dependence on the karma.<br />when wrong happens around us we think its just what we deserve,</p>
<p>but then finally the good does triumph over the bad<br />see the "optimistic view point"</p>

<p>    -Hi</p>
<p>    good.<br />    but i dont share your pessimistic view.</p>
<p>    first of all since i am associated with the chidambaram temple <br />for <br />    quite some time i know it evokes more emotions than mny others.</p>
<p>very<br />      incident itself, inspite of Ottakoothar confirming it with his<br />      ThakkayAgabharani. </p>
<p>    dont you beleive poets. they end up saying something else when <br />they <br />    mean other things.</p>
<p>    i have a very great beleif in the similarities between <br />thiruvengadu <br />    and chidambaram. <br />    the previous one near the confluence of kaveri and the sea is <br />  called <br />    aadi chidambaram and is mentioned by valmiki as swetharanyam<br />    the re is also a natrajar there in a similar shrine of almost the <br />    same dimensions (but right now his importance is taken away by <br />  agora <br />    murthy.</p>
<p>    the temple also has a kali with a broken neck as a result of a <br />    difficult move in a dance competition with shiva)<br />    what I am arrving at is at some point the structure of this <br />temple <br />    and chidambaram must have been very alike.<br />    the temple complex also has a vishnu shrine. a small one.<br />    i guess the original shrine in thillai must have also been of the <br />    same proportions and in the outer parikrama ( where the <br />  mulattanavar <br />    is also present)<br />    there seems no opposition when achuta rayar re installed a new <br />    govindaraja within the outer parikrama in 1530 or so. the <br />    dheekshithars must have been thankful that vijaynagar built for <br />  them <br />    a rajagopuram and repaired the whole temple.<br />    it was when the kondama naicken tried to do it in the inner <br />  parikrama <br />    that they have protested.<br />    also if you observe the structure of the temples in thillai you <br />  will <br />    feel the architecture is a little unbalanced and lopsided.<br />    where natraja faces south what must have been a wide hall in <br />front  <br />    of him, only half exists. the other half taken by the govinda <br />rajar <br />    shrine.<br />    i guess the original govindarajar must have been where the <br />thaayar <br />    shrine is now very next to the very important nadana sabhai.<br />    also the only side with a walled up entrance is next to this . <br />the <br />    south entrance to the main temple is walled up for some reason. <br />it <br />    even has a nandi outside.<br />    so chidambaram temple must be holding more secrets than those <br />that <br />    will be unraveled in our life times.<br />    i will add a sketch of the inner shrine in our pictures folder <br />soon.<br />    regards<br />    venketesh</p>
<p>    And regarding the Vaishnavite followers <br />    following<br />      suit, you can see very well today how many vaishnavites gave <br />their<br />      voices for the Rama sethu Issue and similar issues. They (we) <br />are <br />    a very<br />      silent group, for whom "rAman AndAlum rAvaNan Andalum oru <br />  kavalayum<br />      illa.." [:D] The most insensitive group I would say. Like <br />wise, <br />    those<br />      Vaishnavites also would have stood on the road sides and cried <br />    out. A<br />      Ramanuja or A Koorathazhwan or A Periya Nambi and a similar few <br />    are all<br />      but exception to this. Also from the date line of 1127 AD when <br />  this<br />      incident is supposed to have happened Ramanuja was already old <br />at <br />    110<br />      years of age and Koorathazhwan had passed away. So we can only <br />    expect<br />      the Vaishnvaites to follow, but CANNOT CONCLUDE.</p>
<p>      And for the records I am not disagreeing with the probability <br />of a<br />      similar character like Rangaraja Nambi to have existed. Only <br />that <br />    it<br />      finds no record in the history.</p>

<p>        Hi</p>
<p>        so what venkatesh????<br />        fiction writers are given a huge allowance<br />        the reason we are all here is because of kalki and didnt he <br />  make <br />    a<br />        great use of that licence.<br />        imagine a flower boy and a boat girl on karikalans throne.it <br />    happened<br />        in ponniyin selvan.</p>
<p>        IF govindarajar was thrown into the sea i am sure a lot of his<br />        vaishnavite followers would have followed suit. either <br />    voluntarily or<br />        by force.<br />        the dikshithar suicides 400 years later in the sameplace is an<br />        example of those cruel times.</p>
<p>        i am sure there must have been atleast one person like kamal's<br />        charecter. and from the accounts of sri vaishnavism that i <br />know <br />    there<br />        is no dearth of dedicated followers. kamal has not gone <br />against <br />    the<br />        spirit of the event.</p>
<p>        what we were discussing here was the background settings. <br />  before <br />    it<br />        became one of the most knowledgable discussions of the event.<br />        venketesh</p>

<p>          That is precisely what I said as, the Rangaraja Nambi <br />  character<br />          finds no mention in any of the Traditional Srivaishnavite <br />    accounts.<br />          He is very correct.</p>

        <p>Mr Venketesh,</p>
<p>Sorry I missed this one in my last post.</p>
<p>=================Quote===================<br />dont you beleive poets. they end up saying something else when they </p>
<blockquote><p>  mean other things.<br />================Unquote==================</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed. But in the context of the present discussion, what could be <br />the "other things" that the poet possibly meant to convey with those <br />words, which rather gives direct account of the incident. </p>
<p>Also remember, this finds place in the Guruparampara prabhavam as <br />well. The reason for taking Ottakoothar for help is to only convey <br />that the King's own poet and contemporary had confirmed this act, <br />even if the Vaishnavite Guruparampara Prabhavam is to be discarded on <br />the reasons of being a sectarian work. </p>
<p>And lastly, the poets are not always liars, especially when they are <br />praising the deeds of their kings. They, at best, only exaggerate. <br />Logically even assuming that Ottakoothar had lied here, why would he <br />need to do this and whom to please. If to please the king, then it is <br />very much obvious that the King shares the views of intolerance <br />expressed by the poet. Otherwise, the King would have condemned such <br />a verse, which would bring a certain disrepute to him. Logical isn't <br />it??</p>

<p>  i have a very great beleif in the similarities between thiruvengadu <br />  and chidambaram. <br />  the previous one near the confluence of kaveri and the sea is <br />called <br />  aadi chidambaram and is mentioned by valmiki as swetharanyam<br />  the re is also a natrajar there in a similar shrine of almost the <br />  same dimensions (but right now his importance is taken away by <br />agora <br />  murthy.</p>

<p>  And regarding the Vaishnavite followers <br />  following<br />    suit, you can see very well today how many vaishnavites gave their<br />    voices for the Rama sethu Issue and similar issues. They (we) are <br />  a very<br />    silent group, for whom "rAman AndAlum rAvaNan Andalum oru <br />kavalayum<br />    illa.." [:D] The most insensitive group I would say. Like wise, <br />  those<br />    Vaishnavites also would have stood on the road sides and cried <br />  out. A<br />    Ramanuja or A Koorathazhwan or A Periya Nambi and a similar few <br />  are all<br />    but exception to this. Also from the date line of 1127 AD when <br />this<br />    incident is supposed to have happened Ramanuja was already old at <br />  110<br />    years of age and Koorathazhwan had passed away. So we can only <br />  expect<br />    the Vaishnvaites to follow, but CANNOT CONCLUDE.</p>
<p>    And for the records I am not disagreeing with the probability of a<br />    similar character like Rangaraja Nambi to have existed. Only that <br />  it<br />    finds no record in the history.</p>

<p>      Hi</p>
<p>      so what venkatesh????<br />      fiction writers are given a huge allowance<br />      the reason we are all here is because of kalki and didnt he <br />make <br />  a<br />      great use of that licence.<br />      imagine a flower boy and a boat girl on karikalans throne.it <br />  happened<br />      in ponniyin selvan.</p>
<p>      IF govindarajar was thrown into the sea i am sure a lot of his<br />      vaishnavite followers would have followed suit. either <br />  voluntarily or<br />      by force.<br />      the dikshithar suicides 400 years later in the sameplace is an<br />      example of those cruel times.</p>
<p>      i am sure there must have been atleast one person like kamal's<br />      charecter. and from the accounts of sri vaishnavism that i know <br />  there<br />      is no dearth of dedicated followers. kamal has not gone against <br />  the<br />      spirit of the event.</p>
<p>      what we were discussing here was the background settings. <br />before <br />  it<br />      became one of the most knowledgable discussions of the event.<br />      venketesh</p>

<p>the temple also has a kali with a broken neck as a result of a <br />difficult move in a dance competition with shiva)<br />what I am arrving at is at some point the structure of this temple <br />and chidambaram must have been very alike.<br />the temple complex also has a vishnu shrine. a small one.<br />i guess the original shrine in thillai must have also been of the <br />same proportions and in the outer parikrama ( where the mulattanavar <br />is also present)<br />there seems no opposition when achuta rayar re installed a new <br />govindaraja within the outer parikrama in 1530 or so. the <br />dheekshithars must have been thankful that vijaynagar built for them <br />a rajagopuram and repaired the whole temple.<br />it was when the kondama naicken tried to do it in the inner parikrama <br />that they have protested.<br />also if you observe the structure of the temples in thillai you will <br />feel the architecture is a little unbalanced and lopsided.<br />where natraja faces south what must have been a wide hall in front  <br />of him, only half exists. the other half taken by the govinda rajar <br />shrine.<br />i guess the original govindarajar must have been where the thaayar <br />shrine is now very next to the very important nadana sabhai.<br />also the only side with a walled up entrance is next to this . the <br />south entrance to the main temple is walled up for some reason. it <br />even has a nandi outside.<br />so chidambaram temple must be holding more secrets than those that <br />will be unraveled in our life times.<br />i will add a sketch of the inner shrine in our pictures folder soon.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>
<p>And regarding the Vaishnavite followers <br />following</p>
<blockquote><p>  suit, you can see very well today how many vaishnavites gave their<br />  voices for the Rama sethu Issue and similar issues. They (we) are <br />a very<br />  silent group, for whom "rAman AndAlum rAvaNan Andalum oru kavalayum<br />  illa.." [:D] The most insensitive group I would say. Like wise, <br />those<br />  Vaishnavites also would have stood on the road sides and cried <br />out. A<br />  Ramanuja or A Koorathazhwan or A Periya Nambi and a similar few <br />are all<br />  but exception to this. Also from the date line of 1127 AD when this<br />  incident is supposed to have happened Ramanuja was already old at <br />110<br />  years of age and Koorathazhwan had passed away. So we can only <br />expect<br />  the Vaishnvaites to follow, but CANNOT CONCLUDE.</p>
<p>  And for the records I am not disagreeing with the probability of a<br />  similar character like Rangaraja Nambi to have existed. Only that <br />it<br />  finds no record in the history.</p>

<p>    Hi</p>
<p>    so what venkatesh????<br />    fiction writers are given a huge allowance<br />    the reason we are all here is because of kalki and didnt he make <br />a<br />    great use of that licence.<br />    imagine a flower boy and a boat girl on karikalans throne.it <br />happened<br />    in ponniyin selvan.</p>
<p>    IF govindarajar was thrown into the sea i am sure a lot of his<br />    vaishnavite followers would have followed suit. either <br />voluntarily or<br />    by force.<br />    the dikshithar suicides 400 years later in the sameplace is an<br />    example of those cruel times.</p>
<p>    i am sure there must have been atleast one person like kamal's<br />    charecter. and from the accounts of sri vaishnavism that i know <br />there<br />    is no dearth of dedicated followers. kamal has not gone against <br />the<br />    spirit of the event.</p>

        <p>Venketesh,</p>
<p>Sorry if I have miscommunicated. Rather I am with you on this. Regarding<br />the blog, I only said that the blogger reflected my thoughts about the<br />authenticity of the Rangaraja Nambi character. Remember I said, this<br />name or character is not mentioned in History. Of course, I do not share<br />his anguish though. I am definitely with you for the fact that a<br />historical movie or novel can never be complete or atleast interesting<br />without the fictitious characters like Poonguzhali and Senthan Amudhan<br />as indicated by you.</p>
<p>However I beg to differ with your following observation<br />===========================Quote==============================<br />IF govindarajar was thrown into the sea i am sure a lot of his</p>
<blockquote><p>  vaishnavite followers would have followed suit. either voluntarily or<br />  by force.<br />  the dikshithar suicides 400 years later in the sameplace is an<br />  example of those cruel times.<br />==========================Unquote============================</p></blockquote>
<p>incident itself, inspite of Ottakoothar confirming it with his<br />ThakkayAgabharani. And regarding the Vaishnavite followers following<br />suit, you can see very well today how many vaishnavites gave their<br />voices for the Rama sethu Issue and similar issues.

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>so what venkatesh????<br />fiction writers are given a huge allowance<br />the reason we are all here is because of kalki and didnt he make a <br />great use of that licence.<br />imagine a flower boy and a boat girl on karikalans throne.it happened <br />in ponniyin selvan.</p>
<p>IF govindarajar was thrown into the sea i am sure a lot of his <br />vaishnavite followers would have followed suit. either voluntarily or <br />by force.<br />the dikshithar suicides 400 years later in the sameplace is an <br />example of those cruel times.</p>
<p>i am sure there must have been atleast one person like kamal's <br />charecter. and from the accounts of sri vaishnavism that i know there <br />is no dearth of dedicated followers. kamal has not gone against the <br />spirit of the event.</p>
<p>what we were discussing here was the background settings. before it <br />became one of the most knowledgable discussions of the event. <br />venketesh</p>

<p>there is a lot of contreversy on this cheraman as he is supposed to <br />have preceded the nayanmar of the same name by 150-200 years.<br />perhaps there were two branches of cheras running parallely one from <br />karur and one from vanji.</p>

<p>    Hi</p>
<p>    what was his approximate period<br />    before or after cheraman perumal?<br />    we certainly need to discuss his dynastyand the last chera man <br />who <br />    converted to islam, and died in mecca also reportedly came from <br />  the  <br />    same family</p>
<p>    venketesh</p>
<p>    He was a very pure Rama bhaktha and he <br />      would lose everything for the sake of Rama. It is said that <br />  once, <br />      when he was listening to Ramayana upanyasam, during the "padai <br />      thirattum padalam" for the Lanka War, he forgot his identity <br />and <br />      ordered all his chieftains to be prepared immediately to go <br />and <br />      assist Rama. Then his clever minister, who knew him well, <br />  somehow <br />      conveyed the matter to the upanyasakar and the upanyasakar <br />      immediately completed the day by simply saying Rama killed <br />  Ravana <br />      and thus was victorious, without elaboration.</p>
<p>      Such was his devotion to Rama and he saw everyone as mostly <br />Rama <br />    and <br />      hence he saw the Vishnu Murthy of Chitrakoodam as Rama too. </p>

<p>          SPS Sir,</p>
<p>          The Chitrkoodam of Ramayana is neither the Thillai <br />Vilaakam <br />  nor <br />          Chidambaram. It is somewhere in Madhyapradesh. This is <br />were <br />        Rama,Sita <br />          and Lakshmana stayed for atleast 11 years before Sita was <br />      abducted <br />        by <br />          Ravana. One can google and find many references to this <br />  place.</p>
<p>          Azhwars never talk about Chidambaram being associated with <br />          Thiruchitrakoodam where Rama had stayed. The the name for <br />        Chidambaram <br />          as Thiruchithrakoodam is at best a co-incidence or <br />namesake.</p>
<p>        hi venkatesh,</p>
<p>        missed your ref above in the flurry of mails - from what i <br />  read <br />    of <br />        the kulasekara hymns - he is the one who coins the term <br />        tiruchitrakootam ....moved by the beauty of the lord and the <br />      beauty <br />        of thillai he is reminded of the beauty of Chitrakutam<br />        of the north.the further references of thillai 3000 cement <br />the <br />        argument beyong doubt.</p>
<p>        further references below</p>

<p>        VERY Important lines</p>

<p>        Another clue - he is comparing the idol with rama and <br />  sita....not <br />        sure if he would do that if it were a sayana kolam..</p>

<p>        from above it looks more that kulasekara was describing an <br />  idol <br />    of <br />        rama ...in either a seated or standing pose</p>

<blockquote><p>  I get to see some obscure characters. I am not able<br />  to read it in <br />  Tamizh. Can some one guide me as to how to get it<br />  done.</p>
<p>  Mr Vijay,</p>
<p>  Excellent writeup. For a Vaishnavite perspective,<br />  the story of <br />  Chidambaram goes like this (Could be a well<br />  exaggerated and <br />  aberrated one). Once, there was a competition<br />  between Nataraja and <br />  Thillai Kaali as to who is the best dancer. They<br />  decided to compete <br />  it out. As Vishnu is the Supreme Being (for the<br />  Vaishnavite <br />  Perspective) they approached Him to be the judge. So<br />  Vishnu in the <br />  form of Govindaraja came and reclined at Chidambaram<br />  to be the judge <br />  for the competition. This is how both the murthys<br />  came into <br />  existence in the same temple. </p>
<p>  The story goes on to get completed thus, when<br />  Nataraja did the most <br />  wonderful cosmic form of the dance by lifting His<br />  leg, which Kaali <br />  could not do due to the inherent shyness of a Woman<br />  and thus <br />  Govindaraja declared Nataraja as the winner. I dont<br />  know if any one <br />  of you heard this before. But I have heard it<br />  umpteen times.</p>
<p>  =========Quote================<br />  therupon vishnu lay prostrate ( <br />    bhoga sayana) in the hall of thillai inorder that<br />  his prayers to <br />  see <br />    the other leg might be granted.<br />  ========Unquote===============</p>
<p>  I have a different view of this. Fine that it was<br />  recorded by <br />  Manikkavasagar. But can someone confirm if<br />  Manikkavasagar used the <br />  word "prostrate". The reason I ask this is,<br />  Logically, a person who <br />  is praying or prostrating would never be in such<br />  comfortable Bhoga <br />  Sayana pose. Rather, only the person, who is so very<br />  comfortable and <br />  doesn't need anything more, would be in such a pose.<br />  I am sure you <br />  would all agree to this logic. Please correct me if<br />  I am wrong.</p>
<p>  Also as I am unable to read the Tamizh verses below,<br />  please clarify.</p>
<p>  But Personally my opinion about the co-existence of<br />  both the murthys <br />  at the same temple is different. In my humble<br />  opinion, as I would <br />  always, I would discard the Sthalapuranic versions<br />  of both <br />  Vaishnavites and Saivites. I would only say that<br />  both were in <br />  separate temples close to each other, with no<br />  connection whatsoever. <br />  When Kulothunga II wanted to expand the temple of<br />  Nataraja, it is <br />  recorded that he approached the Vaishnavites of the<br />  area to <br />  dislocate the Govindaraja shrine for which there was<br />  a vehement <br />  opposition. Irked at it, he got the Murthy removed<br />  from the temple. <br />  This is recorded by the court poet Ottakoothar in<br />  his ThakkayAga <br />  bharaNi too. Now there is also the account of the<br />  Senji, king, re-<br />  installing the Perumal in the shrine, much against<br />  the opposition of <br />  the Dhikshitars. I would only say that the<br />  Vaishnavites were very <br />  good in getting the king convinced that the Nataraja<br />  temple was <br />  expanded over the old Vishnu temple and hence<br />  Govindaraja needs to <br />  be re-instated there. This king being a staunch<br />  Vaishnavite did so <br />  with his authority.</p>
<p>  So the basic problem, in my opinion, in Chidambaram,<br />  is the egoistic <br />  authorities of two Kings during two different era,<br />  which has give <br />  rise to the Saivite-Vaishnavite conflict.</p>
<p>  I request the learned members to correct me,<br />  wherever I am wrong in <br />  my above assumptions.</p>

<p>    pg 26</p>
<p>    he quotes KAN - colas - </p>
<p>    there were several temples which containeed<br />  shrines of both shiva <br />  and <br />    vishnu side by side - the most conspicuous<br />  instance being that of <br />    chidambaram"</p>
<p>    the saivates regard this diety of govindaraja at<br />  thillai as <br />  admiring <br />    the divine dance of nataraja ... it is inferred<br />  that this deity <br />  must <br />    have been housed on an elevated platform in the<br />  prakara of the <br />  natraja <br />    temple in front of the natraja shrine. hence the<br />  place of abode of <br />    vishnu is called terri ambalam or tiru citra<br />  kutam. in early times <br />  ( <br />    atleast upto to the days of tirumangai alvar and<br />  kulasekara alvar, <br />  the <br />    worship of the two dieties, nataraja and<br />  govindaraja, was in the <br />  hands <br />    of the thillai 3000.</p>
<p>    the co existence of natraja and govindaraja is<br />  clearly documented <br />  by <br />    manikkavacakar...whose tirukkovaiyur is a<br />  subjective poem - the <br />    ahapporul on the lord of tillai. in this we find a<br />  stanza which <br />  refers <br />    to the position of the twin gods, shiva and vishnu<br />  thus : he <br />  (vishnu ) <br />    eho tried in vain by splitting open the earth,<br />  inorder to see the <br />  two <br />    feet of him who destroyed the tripura, begged of<br />  siva with <br />  extended <br />    hands to show them, out of mercy, for worship.<br />  then the lord, <br />  moved <br />    somewhat showed vishnu one of his legs. therupon<br />  vishnu lay <br />  prostrate ( <br />    bhoga sayana) in the hall of thillai inorder that<br />  his prayers to <br />  see <br />    the other leg might be granted.</p>

<p>        The Chitrkoodam of Ramayana is neither the Thillai Vilaakam <br />nor <br />        Chidambaram. It is somewhere in Madhyapradesh. This is were <br />      Rama,Sita <br />        and Lakshmana stayed for atleast 11 years before Sita was <br />    abducted <br />      by <br />        Ravana. One can google and find many references to this <br />place.</p>
<p>        Azhwars never talk about Chidambaram being associated with <br />        Thiruchitrakoodam where Rama had stayed. The the name for <br />      Chidambaram <br />        as Thiruchithrakoodam is at best a co-incidence or namesake.</p>

<p>  so atleast that part is agreed -thillai had a <br />  vishnu/rama/govindaraja/sayana idol....and was sung as <br />  tirucitrakoodam, and was maintained at that time by the thillai <br />3000</p>
<p>  now going to what ootakutthan says( thanks to divakar sir)</p>
<p>  kadalil paLLikondavanukku <br />  kadalileeyee palli amaippathu</p>
<p>  do we take this as it is literally - meaning is the statue a <br />  reclining ( sayana) vishnu idol that was thrown, dropped, kept in <br />  the sea - or is it just pun of the poet.</p>

<p></p></blockquote>
<p>so atleast that part is agreed -thillai had a <br />vishnu/rama/govindaraja/sayana idol....and was sung as <br />tirucitrakoodam, and was maintained at that time by the thillai 3000</p>
<p>now going to what ootakutthan says( thanks to divakar sir)</p>
<p>kadalil paLLikondavanukku <br />kadalileeyee palli amaippathu</p>
<p>do we take this as it is literally - meaning is the statue a <br />reclining ( sayana) vishnu idol that was thrown, dropped, kept in <br />the sea - or is it just pun of the poet.</p>

        <p>Mr Vijay,</p>
<p>Good quotes! Just to know a little more about Kulasekhara Azhwar, he <br />was a King of Chera dynasty. He was a very pure Rama bhaktha and he <br />would lose everything for the sake of Rama. It is said that once, <br />when he was listening to Ramayana upanyasam, during the "padai <br />thirattum padalam" for the Lanka War, he forgot his identity and <br />ordered all his chieftains to be prepared immediately to go and <br />assist Rama. Then his clever minister, who knew him well, somehow <br />conveyed the matter to the upanyasakar and the upanyasakar <br />immediately completed the day by simply saying Rama killed Ravana <br />and thus was victorious, without elaboration.</p>
<p>Such was his devotion to Rama and he saw everyone as mostly Rama and <br />hence he saw the Vishnu Murthy of Chitrakoodam as Rama too. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>    SPS Sir,</p>
<p>    The Chitrkoodam of Ramayana is neither the Thillai Vilaakam nor <br />    Chidambaram. It is somewhere in Madhyapradesh. This is were <br />  Rama,Sita <br />    and Lakshmana stayed for atleast 11 years before Sita was <br />abducted <br />  by <br />    Ravana. One can google and find many references to this place.</p>
<p>    Azhwars never talk about Chidambaram being associated with <br />    Thiruchitrakoodam where Rama had stayed. The the name for <br />  Chidambaram <br />    as Thiruchithrakoodam is at best a co-incidence or namesake.</p>
<p>  hi venkatesh,</p>
<p>  missed your ref above in the flurry of mails - from what i read of <br />  the kulasekara hymns - he is the one who coins the term <br />  tiruchitrakootam ....moved by the beauty of the lord and the <br />beauty <br />  of thillai he is reminded of the beauty of Chitrakutam<br />  of the north.the further references of thillai 3000 cement the <br />  argument beyong doubt.</p>
<p>  further references below</p>
<p>  .....<br />  thillainagarth thirucchithra koodan thannul<br />  engalthani muthalvanaiyem perumaan rannai<br />  enrukolo kankulirak kaanu naale 10.1</p>

<p>  VERY Important lines</p>
<p>  animaniyaa sanatthiruntha ....</p>
<p>  does it mean seated like the crown jewel...seated!!!</p>
<p>  ........<br />  sitthirakoo tatthirunthaan Rannai yinRu<br />  thillainagarth thiruchchithra koodan thannuL<br />  etthanaiyum kankulirak kaanap perraa<br />  irunilatthaark kimaiyavarne rovvaar thaamE 10.4</p>
<p>  Another clue - he is comparing the idol with rama and sita....not <br />  sure if he would do that if it were a sayana kolam..</p>
<p>  ...............<br />  senrinithu veerriruntha vammaan rannaith<br />  thillainagarth thiruchchithra koodan thannul<br />  enrum ninraa nnavanivanen retthi naalum<br />  inrainchumino veppozhuthum thondeer neere 10.10</p>
<p>  enrum ninraa ...??</p>
<p>  from above it looks more that kulasekara was describing an idol of <br />  rama ...in either a seated or standing pose</p>

<p>Dear R.Venkatesh,</p>
<p>In AD 1597 (AD 1599 - according to Sources of Vijayanagar History, <br />Page 272) KRISHNAPPA NAYAKA was supervising the improvements he <br />ordered in the Temple of Govindaraja within "the Great Siva Temple".<br />Jesuit Father N.Pimenta who passed through Chidambaram accounts:</p>
<p>" Whether it were lawful to place the sign of Perumal in the Temple <br />of Chidambaram, some refused, others by their legates importunately <br />urged, and the Naicks of the Ginji, decreed to erect it in the <br />temple..</p>
<p>The priests of the temple which were the Treasurers (were) <br />withstanding and threatening, if it were done, to cast down <br />themselves from the top. The Brahmanas of the Temple swore to doe <br />(do or die ?) the like after they buried the former, which yet after <br />better advice they performed not..</p>
<p>Krishnappa went on without hesitation. Whereupon the priests, <br />climbing one of high Gopurams of the temple, started to cast <br />themselves down while the Nayak was in the temple...</p>
<p>About TWENTY had perished in that precipitation on that day of our <br />departure, whereas the Naicks, angry caused his gunners to shoot the <br />rest, which killed two of them, the rest wandering in uncertain <br />places. A Woman also was so hote in this zealous quarrel that she <br />cut her own throat .. "</p>
<p>regards / sps</p>

<blockquote><p>  the accord restricting the bramhotsavams of the vaishnavites was <br />  signed by the priests of the govindaraja temple in 1867 and till <br />that <br />  there sems to have been a friction between the two temples.<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>    SPS Sir,</p>
<p>    The Chitrkoodam of Ramayana is neither the Thillai Vilaakam nor <br />    Chidambaram. It is somewhere in Madhyapradesh. This is were <br />  Rama,Sita <br />    and Lakshmana stayed for atleast 11 years before Sita was <br />abducted <br />  by <br />    Ravana. One can google and find many references to this place.</p>
<p>    Azhwars never talk about Chidambaram being associated with <br />    Thiruchitrakoodam where Rama had stayed. The the name for <br />  Chidambaram <br />    as Thiruchithrakoodam is at best a co-incidence or namesake.</p>
<p>  hi venkatesh,</p>
<p>  missed your ref above in the flurry of mails - from what i read of <br />  the kulasekara hymns - he is the one who coins the term <br />  tiruchitrakootam ....moved by the beauty of the lord and the beauty <br />  of thillai he is reminded of the beauty of Chitrakutam<br />  of the north.the further references of thillai 3000 cement the <br />  argument beyong doubt.</p>
<p>  further references below</p>

<p>  The Chitrkoodam of Ramayana is neither the Thillai Vilaakam nor <br />  Chidambaram. It is somewhere in Madhyapradesh.

<p>  Azhwars never talk about Chidambaram being associated with <br />  Thiruchitrakoodam where Rama had stayed. The the name for <br />Chidambaram <br />  as Thiruchithrakoodam is at best a co-incidence or namesake.</p></blockquote>
<p>hi venkatesh,</p>
<p>missed your ref above in the flurry of mails - from what i read of <br />the kulasekara hymns - he is the one who coins the term <br />tiruchitrakootam ....moved by the beauty of the lord and the beauty <br />of thillai he is reminded of the beauty of Chitrakutam<br />of the north.the further references of thillai 3000 cement the <br />argument beyong doubt.</p>

<p>DEAR VIJAY,</p>
<p>YOUR VOICING MY CONCERNS ..</p>
<p>THE FOCUS IS NOW SHIFTED TO A SINGLE FACT.</p>
<p>IS Kulothunga II - GUILTY of displacing a stone Sayanaperumal and <br />having put it in the SEA  </p>
<p>or NOT ?</p>
<p>Which Kulothunga II ?</p>
<p>The one who motivated Sekkizhar to hymn Periapurnam.</p>
<p>Your question 7 is running in all of our minds too..</p>
<p>Perhaps this is not discussed for the first time since its <br />happenening..</p>
<p>Let us look into all the aspects.</p>
<p>anbudan / sps</p>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>7. so an idol was put into the sea - and was later recovered and <br />restored back into the temple compound....this is where it defies <br />logic . first of all it would take a lot of effort to dislocate a <br />massive stone idol and to carry it all the way to the sea and drop <br />it - then fishermen finding it - how did they bring it up and again <br />move it back into the compound - would the king allow it to happen -</p>
<p>then why drop it in the first place??</p>
<p>another idol ( metal) moves to lower tirupathi - was this then the <br />utsavar that got dropped into the sea - makes more sense that way...</p>
<p>the stone utsavar - moved from earlier location facing natarajar - <br />somewhere within the temple compound. the metal moolavar dropped <br />into the sea - found by fishermen - sent to tirupathi and <br />consecrated there...</p>

<p><acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastri wrote that first mention of co-existence of Nataraja &amp; <br />Govindaraja was by Manickavasagar (who's not figuring in <br />Periapuranam - and so estimated to) belong to post Sundara - 8th AD.</acronym></p>
<p>There are lose ends..</p>
<p>we will try to get more details ...</p>

<blockquote><p>  I get to see some obscure characters. I am not able to read it in <br />  Tamizh. Can some one guide me as to how to get it done.</p>
<p>  Mr Vijay,</p>
<p>  Excellent writeup. For a Vaishnavite perspective, the story of <br />  Chidambaram goes like this (Could be a well exaggerated and <br />  aberrated one). Once, there was a competition between Nataraja and <br />  Thillai Kaali as to who is the best dancer. They decided to <br />compete <br />  it out. As Vishnu is the Supreme Being (for the Vaishnavite <br />  Perspective) they approached Him to be the judge. So Vishnu in the <br />  form of Govindaraja came and reclined at Chidambaram to be the <br />judge <br />  for the competition. This is how both the murthys came into <br />  existence in the same temple. </p>
<p>  The story goes on to get completed thus, when Nataraja did the <br />most <br />  wonderful cosmic form of the dance by lifting His leg, which Kaali <br />  could not do due to the inherent shyness of a Woman and thus <br />  Govindaraja declared Nataraja as the winner. I dont know if any <br />one <br />  of you heard this before. But I have heard it umpteen times.</p>
<p>  =========Quote================<br />  therupon vishnu lay prostrate ( <br />    bhoga sayana) in the hall of thillai inorder that his prayers to <br />  see <br />    the other leg might be granted.<br />  ========Unquote===============</p>
<p>  I have a different view of this. Fine that it was recorded by <br />  Manikkavasagar. But can someone confirm if Manikkavasagar used the <br />  word "prostrate". The reason I ask this is, Logically, a person <br />who <br />  is praying or prostrating would never be in such comfortable Bhoga <br />  Sayana pose. Rather, only the person, who is so very comfortable <br />and <br />  doesn't need anything more, would be in such a pose. I am sure you <br />  would all agree to this logic. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>  Also as I am unable to read the Tamizh verses below, please <br />clarify.</p>
<p>  But Personally my opinion about the co-existence of both the <br />murthys <br />  at the same temple is different. In my humble opinion, as I would <br />  always, I would discard the Sthalapuranic versions of both <br />  Vaishnavites and Saivites. I would only say that both were in <br />  separate temples close to each other, with no connection <br />whatsoever. <br />  When Kulothunga II wanted to expand the temple of Nataraja, it is <br />  recorded that he approached the Vaishnavites of the area to <br />  dislocate the Govindaraja shrine for which there was a vehement <br />  opposition. Irked at it, he got the Murthy removed from the <br />temple. <br />  This is recorded by the court poet Ottakoothar in his ThakkayAga <br />  bharaNi too. Now there is also the account of the Senji, king, re-<br />  installing the Perumal in the shrine, much against the opposition <br />of <br />  the Dhikshitars. I would only say that the Vaishnavites were very <br />  good in getting the king convinced that the Nataraja temple was <br />  expanded over the old Vishnu temple and hence Govindaraja needs to <br />  be re-instated there. This king being a staunch Vaishnavite did so <br />  with his authority.</p>
<p>  So the basic problem, in my opinion, in Chidambaram, is the <br />egoistic <br />  authorities of two Kings during two different era, which has give <br />  rise to the Saivite-Vaishnavite conflict.</p>
<p>  I request the learned members to correct me, wherever I am wrong <br />in <br />  my above assumptions.</p>

<p>    there were several temples which containeed shrines of both <br />shiva <br />  and <br />    vishnu side by side - the most conspicuous instance being that <br />of <br />    chidambaram"</p>
<p>    the saivates regard this diety of govindaraja at thillai as <br />  admiring <br />    the divine dance of nataraja ... it is inferred that this deity <br />  must <br />    have been housed on an elevated platform in the prakara of the <br />  natraja <br />    temple in front of the natraja shrine. hence the place of abode <br />of <br />    vishnu is called terri ambalam or tiru citra kutam. in early <br />times <br />  ( <br />    atleast upto to the days of tirumangai alvar and kulasekara <br />alvar, <br />  the <br />    worship of the two dieties, nataraja and govindaraja, was in the <br />  hands <br />    of the thillai 3000.</p>
<p>    the co existence of natraja and govindaraja is clearly <br />documented <br />  by <br />    manikkavacakar...whose tirukkovaiyur is a subjective poem - the <br />    ahapporul on the lord of tillai. in this we find a stanza which <br />  refers <br />    to the position of the twin gods, shiva and vishnu thus : he <br />  (vishnu ) <br />    eho tried in vain by splitting open the earth, inorder to see <br />the <br />  two <br />    feet of him who destroyed the tripura, begged of siva with <br />  extended <br />    hands to show them, out of mercy, for worship. then the lord, <br />  moved <br />    somewhat showed vishnu one of his legs. therupon vishnu lay <br />  prostrate ( <br />    bhoga sayana) in the hall of thillai inorder that his prayers to <br />  see <br />    the other leg might be granted.</p>

<p>Hi<br />I am no expert on this. will need to check up.<br />i am mentioning the people attributed with the building in the <br />reverse. from modern to ancient as i know.<br />the latest renovation of thillai was done by the nagarathars in 1900 <br />or so. the present structure in stone can be attributed to them.<br />prior to that there was a tripartiate agreement which restrained the <br />priests of govindaraja from interfering with the pujas of natraja.<br />this was brokered by the british i guess. how they were interfering <br />is hard to guess.</p>
<p>the mudaliars of thondaimandalam were the previous renovators with <br />opur own dubash pachaiyappa mudaliar doing up one gopuram with his <br />sister.<br />the french and hyders troops had seized the temple and natraja was <br />moved for a second time - this time to thiruvarur . the temple seems <br />to have suffered some damage in gun powder explosions.</p>
<p>prior to that it was the naiks - subsidaries of the vijayanagar who <br />did some work in the temple. it was perhaps during this period that <br />govindaraja was kept back.</p>
<p>before maliks entry the pandyas did a hell of a lot of work on the <br />temple.<br />the cholas of course preceded them.</p>

<p>dear venkatesh</p>
<p>The two murthys co existed. not only that the daily rituals were taken <br />care of by the thillai 3000. this is also sung. </p>
<p>some more questions are to be asked - for that we will need the green <br />signal from the moderators...can we can table them as well. to do this <br />we need an expert - so we need to call the kollaikaaran - sorry author <br />of thillaiyil oru kollaikaran...venkat, can you give us the <br />architecture of the temple ( prior to the 1930's renovation) - with <br />particular reference of the consort shrines..</p>

        <p>Mr Vijay,</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarifications. </p>
<p>=================Quote===================<br />so pl understand </p>
<blockquote><p>  that i wasnt meant to harm anyones feelings.<br />==============Unquote====================</p></blockquote>
<p>I do understand. Rest assured. I understand that we are discussing a <br />very sensitive issue here and "karaNam thappinAl maraNam" is true <br />here. Let me present my case here. I wanted to have an open <br />discussion and hence when one discusses neutrally, there is no <br />reason why one should feel hurt. In my opinion, afterall you had <br />never written anything to hurt.</p>
<p>And many thanks for your insights regarding the co-existence of both <br />the murthys, contrary to my assumption. Thanks for correcting me.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>    I have a different view of this. Fine that it was recorded by <br />    Manikkavasagar. But can someone confirm if Manikkavasagar used <br />the <br />    word "prostrate". The reason I ask this is, Logically, a person <br />  who <br />    is praying or prostrating would never be in such comfortable <br />Bhoga <br />    Sayana pose. Rather, only the person, who is so very comfortable <br />  and <br />    doesn't need anything more, would be in such a pose. I am sure <br />you <br />    would all agree to this logic. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>    Also as I am unable to read the Tamizh verses below, please <br />  clarify.</p>
<p>  hi, try this link or you can go to the archive site ( thiru pl <br />help)</p>

<p>  the reference is kidanthan - lay - the pose of vishnu is more of <br />  enjoying the dance and hence completely agree with you , as even <br />the <br />  author wrote ... ithought many times before posting this verse but <br />  then it is important to use this as a substantiation of the fact <br />  that both the idols co existed - hence posted it - so pl <br />understand <br />  that i wasnt meant to harm anyones feelings.</p>
<p>  regarding the urdva thandavam - i am not really sure of your <br />version <br />  of vishnu being brought in to judge - from even sanksrit <br />references <br />  and iconographic ( pallava times) - the dance of shiva is <br />  accompanied by both vishnu and brahma playing appropriate muscial <br />  instruments....the agamas of sculpture are very clear - size of <br />the <br />  main character guides the composition - so if shiva's dance is the <br />  main plot - he is shown in much bigger size than kali in the same <br />  freeze. bramha and vishnu occupy the outer niches....you even have <br />  nandhi joining in the dance - then he moves into the composition.. <br />  you have numerous such statues in kanchipuram, gkc, big temple. <br />our <br />  sculptures studied these verses and followed them to the tee. <br />  unfortunately as you already pointed out, since vaishnavite <br />temples <br />  do not show this particular form, we can never see the examples <br />from <br />  that side...</p>
<p>  reposting an earlier post of mine - from a book - nataraja in art <br />  thought and literature by C. Sivaramamoorthy<br />  As Siva commences his dance in the evening. Ratnakara imagines, in <br />  the<br />  loftiest terms the sun and moons as the cymbals used by the <br />goddess <br />  of<br />  prosperity herself for tala and laya, the most important in the <br />  nritta<br />  aspect of dance. At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, with<br />  the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon emerging <br />  into<br />  light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />  prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord's <br />  musical<br />  orchestra: <br />  astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />  cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />  samalakshyata nakalakshmih (Haravijya 19.5).</p>
<p>  This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady of <br />  music,<br />  Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma keeping <br />time<br />  and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself is an<br />  adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, <br />there <br />  is<br />  an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described as<br />  Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and Nali:<br />  vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatah?.. vini cha panavi tali<br />  nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />  (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11) tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi <br />hyaninditah<br />  (Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21) naikatanaratas svarah <br />(Lingamahapurana <br />  1,<br />  65, 40). The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina <br />provided<br />  with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva delights in<br />  innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very nature of <br />the<br />  svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita svaras,<br />  the seven famous notes. Siva is also called Rathagita: akshayo<br />  rathagitas cha (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 44). Ratha is <br />Rathantarasama,<br />  by the chant of which he is invoked. Siva's fondness for Sama is <br />very<br />  well known.</p>
<p>  associated with several rishis, like Patanjali, Vyaghrapada, <br />Agastya,<br />  Durvasa, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, Sanatkumara, and others.<br />  Ramabhadra Dikshita gives a graphic description of the rasied foot <br />of<br />  Siva in his bhujangatrasita mode of dance at Chidambaram. Siva's<br />  performance of karanas, making up angaharas, which go along with <br />his<br />  whirling movements in forming mandalas, scatters a spray of water <br />  from<br />  the heavenly stream on his head, bathing and purifying, as it were,<br />  the entire space around, packed with spectators. The rapid swirl of<br />  his arms raises blasts, resounding in the caverns of the mountains <br />of<br />  the quarters, while the light form his raised lotus foot, creates a<br />  halo of light around him, fully observed only by the side-long <br />  glances<br />  of Devi, whose dark eyes are twins it would seem of the blue <br />lotus. <br />  As<br />  Siva dances with the universe as his theme, he almost lets fall the<br />  curtain of illusion, mystifying like Sambara's when soon he reveals<br />  the truth to Patanjali, Vyaghrapada and the other rishis, 'This is <br />  the<br />  illusion of the world as you see it here, and you will now know the<br />  eternal truth of the Supreme Brahman, immanent, beginningless,<br />  eternal, sentient and blissful, unending and monistic:<br />  mandalabhramishu kirnajahnavisikarasnapitachakravalakam<br />  bahuvegapavanavapuritakrandadantaradigadrikandaram<br />  uddhritaikacharanambujaprabhasrij ?yamanapariveshavigraham<br />  utpalodarasahodarambikalochanantavalanaikagocharam sambariyavanikam<br />  athakshipan saprapanchamayanartanam sivah drag adarsayata <br />gonikasutam<br />  vyaghrapadam itaran rishin api tena te svayam idam jagan mrisha <br />  janate<br />  sma paramarthatah punah brahma tat param Anadi <br />  sachchidanandalakshanam<br />  anantam advayam (Patanjalicharita 4. 70-73).</p>
<p>  Like a musician, who, during his song, stops for a while, and draws<br />  attention to the tala or the rhythm beat, Siva the great dancer,<br />  pauses for a while, to sound the drum himself in between, to show <br />the<br />  correct adjustment when necessary. Kshemendra describes the <br />patting <br />  of<br />  the universal lotus by Siva by a play on the world Pushkara, to<br />  suggest his beat of the drum tala. The concept is so lofty it makes<br />  even mountain meru only a small part of the universal lotus.<br />  Sportively the hand of the Lord of Pramathas (Siva) pats the <br />  universal<br />  lotus, thus signifying the proper musical time beat, the lotus <br />which<br />  has the golden Menu mountain as its seed vessel, the twinkling <br />stars<br />  as the pollen filaments, the dark moving clouds, the resounding <br />bees,<br />  and the vast horizon, the lotus leaves: suvamagirikarnake<br />  taralatarakakesare chalajjaladashatpade sphutadigantapatrastrite sa<br />  vahpramathanayakah pradisatu sriyarm yatkarah karoti jagadambuje<br />  chalitatalalilayitam (Brihatkathamanjari, p. 215, 1).</p>
