<p>I have read ponniyin selvan quite a few times but I think Kalki has<br />confused a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym .......probably sliped a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  when he was walking<br />between the thin line of reality and Imagination.......<br />In one perspective we can conclude that<br />Nandini's father is the Pandiya king who took Oomai<br />raani with him when she as unconcious...the pandia king who died<br />in the battle with Karikalan is his son....so nandini is his<br />sister...<br />In another perspective.......<br />i gathered that nandini and mathurandakan were born to oomai rani,<br />but still it is not clear about who their father. most<br />presumably<br />it was Pandiya king. but then again kalki raises a doubt because<br />"how can nandini refer to her father as her lover" and in her<br />hallucinations, nandini refers to the pandiya king as<br />"anbe"........<br />Not only me lot many people in the world are confused abt.<br />If someone could throw some light on this I would be grateful.<br />endrendrum anbudan,<br />Ram</acronym></p>

<p>Hi<br />This is mainly with respect to the question "Who is<br />Nandini?" The answer to this is not very simple I<br />guess (if u go by what the History actually would have<br />been)and a lot of things have to be brought to light<br />before answering this.<br />Instead of answering this question I would like to<br />write a lot other things i learnt in the last couple<br />of days during my travel to the Chola kingdom of<br />Rajaraja chola....I had been on a religious trip to<br />some temples near kudanthai n trichy and i happened to<br />see the Pallippadai which Rajendra chola, son of raja<br />raja chola has built for Panchavanmaadevi (one of the<br />wives of Rajarajan). The question now is why did<br />rajendra build a temple for only one of his<br />stepmothers(n note it : not even for his mother?) n<br />even then why only to this stepmother?! Please try n<br />ponder over it...<br />In the meanwhile i will try n compose a mail of<br />all that i have learnt in the past few days from Mr.<br />Sundhar Bhardawaj, who is an ardent fan of kalki, a<br />very close friend of Balakumaran n who is spending a<br />lot of his efforts in unearthing the chola history<br />especially around the time of rajaraja chola...<br />I am not as good a story teller as he is... but i<br />will try my best n pass on the information to you<br />asap...<br />Bye till then<br />Lavanya</p>

<p>Yes shankar u r right. In the novel Nandhini was born to umai rani 2<br />years after Sundara chola returned to the Chola kingdom from Boodha<br />thevu, so there is no way that Sundara chola is the father of nandhini.</p>

<p>Subject: Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based on </p>
<p>the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how to </p>
<p>start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to begin </p>
<p>this series with a question which pops in all our minds while we read </p>
<p>this great epic &#150; "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by any </p>
<p>author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the entire </p>
<p>novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we get to know </p>
<p>a new facet about her character and equally a new secret about her </p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images that </p>
<p>this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery woman in </p>
<p>a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. When </p>
<p>Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she </p>
<p>presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After listening </p>
<p>to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a helpless girl who </p>
<p>was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but when Vandiya Devan </p>
<p>meets her for the first time she appears to be powerful woman with a </p>
<p>fleet of servants to do her bidding and she also wields enough power </p>
<p>to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally </p>
<p>beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her </p>
<p>beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is </p>
<p>certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the </p>
<p>novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her </p>
<p>little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick </p>
<p>puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava </p>
<p>Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is </p>
<p>unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. </p>
<p>flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan </p>
<p>escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the </p>
<p>reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the </p>
<p>wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies </p>
<p>who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic images </p>
<p>of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an unfortunate </p>
<p>woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure </p>
<p>that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it </p>
<p>Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion </p>
<p>because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after </p>
<p>Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman </p>
<p>saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her memory </p>
<p>and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues </p>
<p>Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the </p>
<p>Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall </p>
<p>in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to </p>
<p>Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. </p>
<p>Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, </p>
<p>Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of </p>
<p>Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not recognize </p>
<p>him?</p>
<p>The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two individuals </p>
<p>after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends Karuthiruman as a </p>
<p>messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi Karai by her </p>
<p>father. But when he arrives there he finds that Mandakini has had </p>
<p>another accident with result her memory is back. Now she does not </p>
<p>recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not know what happened </p>
<p>to her from the time she fell from the lighthouse and her last </p>
<p>accident. </p>
<p>Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? Was </p>
<p>he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles </p>
<p>Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally </p>
<p>beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we </p>
<p>assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly because </p>
<p>I cannot imagine what other business a king like Veerapandiyan would </p>
<p>have with her. And that too, a king who has been ousted from his </p>
<p>kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to rally support. One would </p>
<p>think that he has lots of things in mind other than to wonder about </p>
<p>an unfortunate woman with whom he had traveled for a short while </p>
<p>unless he had developed a special love or affection for her. Only </p>
<p>that could have prompted him find out what happened to her.</p>
<p>Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to </p>
<p>her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman </p>
<p>finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in Chola </p>
<p>household but before he could get this information to the king he is </p>
<p>captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that she was </p>
<p>pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to their </p>
<p>mother.</p>
<p>Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that </p>
<p>Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the </p>
<p>Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: </p>
<p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is also </p>
<p>possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 &#150; 22 years </p>
<p>before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. Either way </p>
<p>we get the same answer &#150; Nandini is Veerapandiyan's daughter.</p>
<p>The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of </p>
<p>Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to </p>
<p>suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the </p>
<p>Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to </p>
<p>Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must note. </p>
<p>When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he starts with </p>
<p>a preamble that &#150; "Is it Ok if I combine some imagination as well </p>
<p>along with the story?" Now which part of it is imagination is </p>
<p>difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to </p>
<p>Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of Nandini's </p>
<p>friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to Pandya </p>
<p>Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and </p>
<p>Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody to </p>
<p>wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes place </p>
<p>the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's house. And </p>
<p>Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the Chola </p>
<p>soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at the </p>
<p>Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by Kundavai? Or </p>
<p>was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was her father? </p>
<p>What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? I </p>
<p>am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that </p>
<p>Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have </p>
<p>told her so as well.</p>
<p>But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that </p>
<p>Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the </p>
<p>presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she </p>
<p>have declared that if she had known that he is her father? </p>
<p>Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had </p>
<p>realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her </p>
<p>brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any </p>
<p>logic!</p>
<p>Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him if </p>
<p>he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she needn't </p>
<p>have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had plainly put </p>
<p>across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and that might have </p>
<p>done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a mad rage. </p>
<p>Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She had </p>
<p>belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her wishes </p>
<p>fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in his mad </p>
<p>love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have </p>
<p>meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters where </p>
<p>he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's daughter </p>
<p>it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan the way she </p>
<p>did. </p>
<p>Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else </p>
<p>thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to </p>
<p>unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<p>Subject: The Nandini Conundrum...</p>
<p>Dear Sumeetha...</p>
<p>Well done. The case was well-thought out and well presented.:-) (I've </p>
<p>got a doubt though- I was of the impression that the Veerapandian who had an affaire with Mandakini -I'm pretty sure that Nandini was Veerapandian's daughter- and the Veerapandian who died at the hands of Aditha Karikalan were one and the same...this is the first I've ever heard about the 'brother' theory.)</p>
<p>I had a discussion on the same subject about a year ago with another <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  </p>
<p>fanatic. To my question about Nandini's origins, I got the reply that she was undoubtedly Vaarapandian's daughter. The reasoning went like this...</p>
<p>1) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would never fall in </p>
<p>love with any one in a space of few days (like a wounded Veerapandian after math of the Madurai por). Assuming that she knew something of her parentage by then, this would amount to a classical "Electra complex" case study.</p>
<p>2) A person of Nandini's character and temperament would go to any length - even to calling her father her lover - for attaining what she wants.</p>
<p>3) The chronology. Even though Kalki muddles up in the chronology, there is clearly a gap of two years between, the parting of Sundara Cholar- Mandagini and the birth of the twins in Pazhayarai. And these two years are filled up with the Payithiyakaran a.k.a Karuthiruman account.</p>
<p>4) The Karuthiruman story - Here he clearly states that he picked up both Mandagini and Veerapandian in his "odam" and left them together in northern Lanka when he went to Rohanam with Veera Pandiyan's message to Mahindan. And when he returned he found Mandagini pregnant. This not-so-subtle information confirms, Veerapandian as the father of mandagini&#146;s twins.</p>
<p>5) The nature of the novel. Even though p.s is a magnum opus, it suffers from a serious flaw - it was serialized and it is handicapped with all the trappings of a Thodarkadhai. So when in the first pagam, in "Nandiniyin kadhalan", Kalki reveals a sensational item that of Nandini being Veera Pandiyan&#146;s lover. In my opinion this is a standard trick of thodar kadhai genre to sustain reader interest - Kalki would have got no inclination about how big or how long the novel was going to be at that time. Later some two years later, he could have decided to make Nandini the daughter and not the lover of Veerapandian as he originally intended.</p>
<p>6) There is one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian was her </p>
<p>father,when he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back at him for abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the house, she does what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling someone else her lover, so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri at that person - in this case VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took revenge on her father for leaving her mother destitute. Later when she grieves for her father, she conveniently forgets that she is the primary reason for his death and swears vengeance on the cholas. This school of thought is advocated by the section that view Nandini as an unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi character who just wants to wreck mayhem on the people around her.</p>
<p>7) The case for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan&#146;s lover is weak. Abathudavi's claim that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi before he died. This could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing here as his progeny (the Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have told him). Thinking of a way to include her in the Pandiyan lineage, he would have proclaimed her as the patta magishi. He was a desperate man looking forward for the continuing confrontation against the cholas after his time. He doesn&#146;t know whether his official heirs have survived (like the kuzhandai vandiyathevan meets). So he makes Nandini legitimate and loyal to the Pandiyan cause.</p>
<p>Well, what does everybody think?</p>
<p>I also thought out another angle...is Nandhini really a villi...or is she merely a victim of circumstance??? I've certain arguments there too...what do you think, Sumi?</p>
<p>Ciaow...</p>

<p>Hi Pavithra,</p>
<p>The angle about Veerapandiyan being Nandini's brother was suggested by Ram in one of his threads here. I think I have given the thread there. I guess we can consider the possibility because if Veerapandiyan senior (the one who met Karuthiruman and Mandakini) is the same one killed by Karikalan then we can expect him to quite old. I guess it is difficult for think that she would have fallen in love with him.</p>
<p>But Nandini as a character has puzzled me a lot for various reasons -</p>
<p>If she wanted to take revenge on the Cholas or especially Kundavai for their treatment towards her the best revenge would be to marry Karikalan. Being the elder brother's wife I am sure we can expect Kundavai to be subservient to her in position and power. Yet she goes ahead and spoils it all by telling karikalan that she had fallen in love with the wounded man.</p>
<p>Did she do it just to scorn Karikalan? To show him - "You have all the power in the world but I would prefer to marry a wounded and defeated king than become your wife and a part of your arrogant family" Is this what she thought?</p>
<p>On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either her father or brother. Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she had deliberately turned Karikalan's anger on him. Why?</p>
<p>"Electra's complex" - quite possible. It can also be a deep yearning to be a part of something important and dangerous. Like she sees herself as a heroine liberating, avenging and taking up responsibilities for an entire kingdom.</p>
<p>We should also not forget that her revenge is a double edged sword both on Veerapandiyan and Karikalan. She turned Karikalan's anger on Veerapandiyan because she felt that he had abandoned her mother and herself therefore he got his head cut off and in the same time she took revenge on Karikalan for allowing Sembiyanmadevi to send her away.</p>
<p>In many ways her revenge on Veerapandiyan was milder because it was </p>
<p>Karikalan who had to bear the guilt of his actions which was a bigger </p>
<p>revenge.</p>

<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Great discussion on Nandhini.I just read all the mails.</p>
<p>What I feel is,when Veerapandiyan escaped from Porkallam </p>
<p>and met Nandhini he would have mistaken Nandhini for Mandhahini.</p>
<p>So he may have said something to Nandhini as if he said it to </p>
<p>Mandhahini.This may be the reason for Veerapandian claiming nandhini </p>
<p>as his Pattamahishi.Nandhini would have worked out the truth from </p>
<p>what he said.</p>
<p>I agree with all the views.I beleive that she is the daughter of </p>

<p>Subject: Who is Nandini? - A follow up</p>
<p>Thanks everybody for all your replies. And congrats Ram for reaching </p>
<p>the half-century mark in the member list. I guess we owe a lot to you </p>
<p>for giving us an opportunity to discuss and talk about the greatest </p>
<p>epic ever written!</p>
<p>Ok now let me do some follow ups with the previous week's</p>
<p>article. </p>
<p>Pavithra had some very interesting insights into Nandini's</p>
<p>character.</p>
<p>1. "A person of Nandini's character and temperament would never</p>
<p>fall in love with any one in a space of few days (like a wounded </p>
<p>Veerapandian aftermath of the Madurai por). Assuming that she knew </p>
<p>something of her parentage by then, this would amount to a </p>
<p>classical "Electra complex" case study."</p>
<p>Now the Electra complex angle was something, which I had not thought </p>
<p>about at all. That should explain her attachment as well as her anger </p>
<p>towards her father.</p>
<p>2. "A person of Nandini's character and temperament would go to</p>
<p>any length - even to calling her father her lover - for attaining what </p>
<p>she wants."</p>
<p>I guess that should answer Prathiba's question.</p>
<p>3. "There is one more angle - that Nandini knew Veerapandian was</p>
<p>her father, when he sought refuge in her house. She wanted to get back at him for abandoning his mother. So when Aditha Karikalan, enters the </p>
<p>house, she does what she knows will anger Karikalan most - calling </p>
<p>someone else her lover, so as to direct Karikalan's kolai veri at </p>
<p>that person - in this case VeeraPandiyan. In a sense, Nandini took </p>

<p>school of thought is advocated by the section that view Nandini as an </p>
<p>unstable, vicious sociopath - an evil villi character who just wants </p>
<p>to wreck mayhem on the people around her."</p>
<p>This is also quite possible but we can only surmise that she wanted </p>
<p>to be a part of something that is important and royal though she was </p>
<p>responsible for Veerapandiyan's death. It can also be a deep</p>
<p>yearning to be a part of something important and dangerous. Like she sees herself as a heroine liberating, avenging and taking up </p>
<p>responsibilities for an entire kingdom. Was Nandini unstable? I </p>
<p>frankly do not know. She seems to be quite in control of her emotions </p>
<p>and actions. The only times we see the struggle within her is when </p>
<p>she is with Vandiya Devan. But to me personally she is one of the </p>
<p>most beautiful and yet complex character created in literature. </p>
<p>"The case for Nandini being Veera Pandiyan's lover is weak. </p>
<p>Abathudavi's claim that Veerapandian made Nandini his patta magishi </p>
<p>before he died. This could be explained as Veerapandian, recognizing </p>
<p>here as his progeny (the Mandagini - Nandini resemblance would have </p>

<p>have survived (like the kuzhandai vandiyathevan meets). So he makes </p>
<p>Nandini legitimate and loyal to the Pandiyan cause."</p>
<p>Here I would like to add I.M lakshmi's views as well &#150;</p>
<p>"when Veerapandiyan escaped from Porkallam and met Nandhini he would have mistaken Nandhini for Mandhahini. So he may have said something to </p>
<p>Nandhini as if he said it to Mandhahini.This may be the reason for </p>
<p>Veerapandian claiming nandhini as his Pattamahishi.Nandhini would </p>
<p>have worked out the truth from what he said."</p>
<p>But Lakshmi I don't agree with you. There no way that</p>
<p>Veerapandiyan - no matter how injured he is could mistake Nandini to be Mandakini. The first reason being the age factor and the second being the fact that Nandini is not handicapped unlike her mother. So there are chances that he must have recognized her as his daughter.</p>
<p>In the end Pavithra asked me a question &#150;</p>
<p>"Is Nandhini really a villi...or is she merely a victim of </p>
<p>circumstance???"</p>
<p>I agree with the latter part of her question. Nandini is undoubtedly </p>
<p>a victim of circumstances whose life has been manipulated by many </p>
<p>people. If you remember in the fourth part of the novel Kalki himself </p>
<p>devotes an entire chapter trying to unravel the turmoil of her heart </p>
<p>where he compares her life with her mother's and describes how </p>
<p>Mandakini had only the wild animals to deal with in her life in </p>
<p>jungle where as her daughter had to suffer a lot being brought up </p>
<p>amidst people.</p>
<p>Hope that answers your question Pavithra!</p>
<p>Guys if you have any other thoughts or points to pen down please do </p>
<p>so. I will round them all up in another follow up.</p>

<p>Dear Sumeetha...</p>
<p>Sorry for the rather long gap- but I'm back anyway.:-)</p>
<p>Your views gave me a good deal of food for thought- I found myself </p>
<p>doing a lot of thinking on what you've said.</p>
<p>About what you've said about Nandhini exacting her revenge by marrying </p>
<p>Karikalan- I though of another view-point. Most of the times, the </p>
<p>daughter-in-law of a household weilds power only in name- she's generally expected to keep back and do what her husband/mother-in-law tells her. The real power, sometimes lies with the daughter of the house-in this case, Kundhavai. Kundavai is not just the daughter of the Chola emperor, but she's very popular with the masses too, and held in great esteem by her people. Nandhini would be thrown into the shadow, while Kundhavai would still retain her prominence. In essence, she may not have been able to get her revenge at all. What do you think?</p></pavithrasri@h...></p>
<blockquote><p> On the other hand we have Veerapandiyan who is either her father or </p>
<p> brother. Yes you are right Pavithra it seems like she had deliberately </p>
<p> turned Karikalan's anger on him. Why?</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you mean, why she made Karikalan kill Veerapandian?</p>
<p>For one thing, she is of the opinion that Karikalan jilted her- in her heart of hearts, she wanted him to win her back in spite of opposition. When he didn't do it, she became furious. And what better way to take her revenge than to make him kill her supposed lover Veerapandian (who was already three-fourths dead anyway, and wouldn't have survived) in a fit of anger (notice: she knows exactly how karikalan will react after he commits the deed of killing her 'beloved' and knows that he will regret it because he has hurt her terribly) then blame him forever?</p>
<p>Personally, its my opinion that Nandhini didn't care much about the Pandya Kingdom either. *She* had been hurt by the Cholas and been humiliated by them, therefore she decided to hurt them as much as she could, notably Karikalan.</p>
<p>Well...what do you think?</p>
<p>BTW, Imli, your photos are cool:-) (How are your studies going on?)</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing more from you guys,</p>

<p>Subject: Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father</p>
<p>Veera pandiyan MAY NOT be Nandhini's father</p>
<p>Sumeetha and Pavitra have presented interesting insights into Nandhini's parentage. My full appreciation to their efforts. What I'd like to present is an alternative. </p>
<p>* Pavitra says Serial novels (thodarkathai) suffer from some form of</p>
<p>inconsistency and that Kalki did'nt plan to make Veera pandiyan - nandini's father and this was a later decision. Unfortunately, this is not true ! </p>
<p>Nandhini mentions very clearly that Veera pandiyan is her lover -not only in the first part (Pudhu vellam) (Nandhiniyin Kaadhalan) but even also in the fourth part !</p>
<p>Just before the murder of Aditya, The head of Pandiyan appears before nandhini - and she exclaims and talks in hallucination like this " Oh Dear ! Have you come ? Welcome !....and so on ...". In fact if you carefully read the novel, you'll find that whenever Nandhini talks about Veera Pandiyan she always says that he is her lover - Even at that critical moment when Pandiya is in great danger!</p>
<p>* There is only one place where there is a contradiction - when she has her final talk with Aditya. Even here, Kalki does not provide this directly. He writes like this : Nandhini said ..."My father is .....father is................." Later Vandhiyathevan says to Kundavi that he overheard this conversation and heard that she was mentioning the name of Veera pandiya here. Now, why the author does not provide this fact directly during Nandhini's final dialogue and provides the info at a much later stage ? I think there is a very very definite purpose and I'll try to answer this question in another mail (Kindly ref my last lines in this mail)</p>
<p>* Thus Kalki very deleberately presents a very consistent picture throughout the Novel that Veera pandiyan is indeed Nandhini's Lover.</p>
<p>* The arguements that support the fact that VPandiyan is Nandhini's father come from Karuthiruman. But please remember - Karuthiruman is totally inconsistent in his story. At one point of time he says he fathered nandhini! </p>
<p>- This fellow has no interest in cholas and is very faithful to pandiyas. </p>
<p>- There is no reason for him to reveal such a big secret to Vandhiyathevan, that too during a time pass chat ! Remember that he deserts vandhiyathevan instantly !</p>
<p>- Thus all of his statments are to be rejected. Infact this fellow is more dangerous that all others and there is more to him that what meets the eye (I plan to write about him in a separate mail - sometime in the future).</p>
<p>* In the conclusion (mudivurai) he wrote for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  ( I don't know whether all of you have read the conclusion. It is very important for the novel as a whole), Kalki says : "Just before her death, Nandhini reveals her birth secret to Arulmozhi..." </p>
<p>If Kalki felt that the secret has already been revealed through Vandhiyathevan he need not have written these lines at all. The fact is that Kalki deliberately confused the readers - he had many more ideas about the characters them selves and possibly had an idea of continuing the story even further !</p>
<p>Now the question is : WHO COULD HAVE FATHERED NANDHINI, IF NOT VEERA PANDIYAN</p>
<p>?????</p>
<p>I plan to take this topic in the near future. Meanwhile your comments on this mail are most welcome.</p>
<p>Cheers !</p>

<p>I thoroughly support these views. </p>
<p>These were exactly the lines i meant when i wrote that nandhini calls veerapandian her lover. like" anbe..." etc... when she talks to herself in the fourth and fifth parts (to be precise, when manimekalai comes to see nandini when she is hosted by sambuvarayar{ the last time i read the novel was two years ago.. but i have a kinda clear picture of this} </p>
<p>these were the words nandini says to herself. she sees the head of veerapandian, calls him "en anbe" and herself as his "pattamagishi". then when manimegalai comes in she asks the head to go away. </p>
<p>one can understand if she was lying bout her birth to someone else. but she was talking to herself and hence there can be no doubt in this regard that veerapandian was not her father but her lover. </p>

<p>Ah, but you see- that was the whole idea. Nandhini was a karpanai character and so Kalki could play around with it as much as he chose. He meant to leave nandhini's parentage a mystery- look how many people are brought into it! Kalki simply listed out a number of people who could possibly be her parets, and left his readers to puzzle over it, I think.</p>

<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Recent mails(or articles!)were really good.Since preparing for exams,few days back I decided not involve much in the discussions.But I realize,I can resist anything but <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ! Gokul,all you have summarized is acceptable by any <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  fan.The novel attracted me because of the</p>

<p>I wish to add few points to the summary like,</p>
<p>-It's a very 'decent'writing that we can suggest even a child to read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .Not only <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  but all his works.In Chandilyan and other historic novel writers we can find an 'importance' given to romance. -the "mudivurai" by kaliki-I've never seen any mudivurai after climax(2 climaxes!)except in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . But without that everyone would feel incompletion. (I still wonder why Kalki had to give such a pitious end to Manimekalai.)</p>
<p>-Aurlmollivarmar's plans for tamilnadu.He made his dreams come true.That creates hope that we can succeed.Whenever I see Tanjore temple,I remember only <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  &amp; it's like a sign of hope.</p>
<p>-Kaliki made me feel,If I had been Chola Kingdom...</p>
<p>-AV respect for elders-his father,Sembiyanmadevi,his sister,even Pazhuvetyars..that greatly impressed me!Present generation has to learn many things from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym !</p>
<p>About Veerapandiyan can never be Nandhini's father...I accept everything.Madhuranthakan is sure Nandhini's twin brother.He becomes the heir of Pandiyan.why anyone who is not a son of Veerapandian should be made his heir?That's my onle doubt!</p>
