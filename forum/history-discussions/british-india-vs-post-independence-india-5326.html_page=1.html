          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I am not that learned to give facts and points like you people do. </p>
<p>During this discussion it was pointed out that no country or society <br />will be the same for ever. There are obviously ups and downs. From <br />1AD to 5AD we call it dark ages of Tamil Nadu because no remarkable <br />develpment was found during that period. Obviously those times, this <br />part of the country would have been ruled by many such kurunila <br />mannargal as you said.<br />But then came the pallavas and at one point, whole of Indian <br />subcontinent (more or less) was ruled by only three prominent kings, <br />Mahendra in south, Pulikesi in the central and Harsha in the north. <br />We make loud noise in this group that <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  is one of the most <br />successful conqeurers of India (putting SE asia he conquered,sure <br />its more than half the size of India). Kings like Ashoka did bring <br />the entire nation in one umbrella..</acronym></p>
<p>Even during supreme muslim rule, whole of south came under Vijanagar <br />emipire. So its not wise to say that no one united India before the <br />brits. Times change and only during 19th century the whole world <br />talked about democracy and hence the single nation concepts came <br />into existence. Till then the entire world never had a fixed <br />boundary.</p>
<p>So saying that ony Brits united us as a single country is just an <br />incident in Indian history. If not for brits, someone else would <br />have done it, its the compulsion of time. But at the same time, I <br />really appreciate Brits for doing this.</p>
<p>If something has to happen, it will...maybe through someone. As a <br />good human, I should thank that person whole heartedly, but should <br />not belive that, if not for that person, my life would have come to <br />a standstill. if not that person some xyz would have come my way. <br />But at the same time, i should not take this arguement and be <br />thankless to the person who helped. The same is my feelign towards <br />brits.</p>
<p>Comapring the rule of different rulers, everyone has their own pros <br />and cons. Ofcourse the maharaja's period were the dark ages, because <br />India didnt get a great leader during those times. Saying british <br />rule was better than muslim rule, is like saying one fire wood is <br />better than the other. Everyone ruined us in their own ways. If you <br />say, British gave us all the technology we have today, the muslims <br />gave us all the architecture marvels we have today. Taj has brought <br />India more pride than Indian Railways. So will you accept if I say <br />that Mogul rule was better than British rule, because Moguls gave an <br />identity to India?</p>
<p>VK arguement - we have a level playing field after the british <br />period. Great joke. Can i contest an election and do good for this <br />country today? You will yes, but its possible only in papers...as <br />per law, yes I can. but practicality??? Can a qualified person get <br />the required thing life, let it be education or job...are we treated <br />equally in India? NO. Who brought these caste discriminations? <br />Sanathana dharma had only varna's which is profession based and <br />never caste based. Its the brain child of the 'divide and rule' <br />policy, which we suffer till date.</p>
<p>Comparing congress and non congress party - Except for a five year <br />BJP rule and 2 year JP rule, when was India ruled by Non congress <br />party? comparing 7 years to 53 years is kidding.</p>
<p>I am ready to accept any facts...will the govt. be bold enough to <br />publicise it? Forget Gandhi's personal life, no one is going to gain <br />anything out of it. But how many facts which affect the common <br />masses have been suppressed in India? Why dont you point those <br />facts...who cares if Gandhi had an affair with a married women or <br />Nehru had an affair with Mrs.MB. They were public figures who did a <br />great deal to the nation.Period. If they prove to be unfit leaders, <br />as an Individual its my liberty to change my mind. Nation is in no <br />way getting affected by this. But surely the nation is affected by <br />many a false propaganda which the brits sow seeds for.</p>
<p>British rule is like this - Giving a hungry man a pot full of rice <br />with a drop of poison mixed in it. They gave India whatever we have <br />today, but with a poisioned minds all around. </p>

<p>Never<br />I am an indian who is proud of his heritage, ashamed of the ills of <br />the country with an unvarnished view of history where I want to give <br />credit to those who deserve it. <br />And I certainly dont need lessons in patriotism.</p>
<p>we have achieved a lot yes but was that possible being a subhject of <br />maharaja ofpudukottai or the zamindar of banganapalle.</p>
<p>the maharajah of pudukottai marthanda pairava thondaiman married and <br />australian and was chucked out by the british who wanted a blue <br />blooded indian royal to inherit his gaddi.<br />as a compensation marthana a top horse owner in australia demanded <br />and got 20 lakh rupees which was one years tazation income in <br />pudukottai. that year incidentaly 10, 000 of his subjects died due to <br />starvation and disease in a drought.</p>
<p>the lives and leisures of the maharajahs would have made india a <br />bankrupt nation.<br />its not singing the english lullaby to give cresit to the british for <br />chucking out these blod thirsty mosquitoes.<br />venketesh</p>

        <p>Hi ravi<br />you and i could go on and on without convincing each other and <br />boring others to the bottoms of their limits.</p>
<p>but just tell me <br />what was the status of the entity called india in 1950, 1900, 1850, <br />1800, 1750, 1700, before that<br />if we honestly refer history we would know there existed no such <br />entity.</p>
<p>today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we <br />should hate them.<br />the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi <br />driver in ajman UAE.</p>
<p>borders change, and so does history with it.<br />european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic <br />tracts as single entities .<br />indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir, <br />or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting <br />incompatible people.<br />in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese <br />and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the case <br />against them.</p>

India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals ruled <br />for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250. <br />Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many <br />states, so what ? US is 50+ states, china was so many states the <br />biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of <br />the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma. Sanskrit was <br />spoken widely before the british split us, tamil was in tamil <br />heartland, we used to speak many languages in indian country. </p>

<p>ripped us we rebound back.... then came the british, fresh out of <br />their dark age, exploring new territories looking for places were <br />they can spread their culture, education (as if no one else was <br />educated), systematically ripped us of our minds and caused people <br />such as yourself who believe in their dominion after 60 years. Whilst <br />you speak of us going the African way, why wont you think of us going <br />the Chinese way ? There lies a mind set, again british preset.</p>

<p>  Hi Venu<br />  I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />  thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid their <br />  taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.</p>
<p>  most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs who <br />  saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh <br />war. <br />  the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />  what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful <br />  nation called india in say 1600.<br />  if you were born in 1600 ( or as you say 1970 if the british had <br />not <br />  come at all) you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of <br />  pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of <br />ramnad <br />  or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of <br />  madurai.<br />  that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />  you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great <br />show <br />  of unity united on their own in the national interest and then <br />opened <br />  negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of <br />  hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of tranvancore, <br />  the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin. <br />  this would have united south india.<br />  then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern <br />hindu <br />  muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings( ar you will be <br />  calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon) to <br />  unite one democratic nation called india.<br />  you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />  even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the <br />sardar <br />  to join the indian confedration.<br />  the maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and <br />  you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and pelf <br />so <br />  that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />  its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.</p>
<p>  have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited <br />  in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been <br />  discussing.</p>
<p>  to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />  trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>  patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should <br />not <br />  be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>  what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or <br />the <br />  slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un <br />united <br />  india.<br />  regards<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric <br />  tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a <br />  shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... <br />pathetic <br />  and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how <br />  people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence <br />India <br />  is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is <br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<p>    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability, <br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly <br />  set afire by the British. </p>
<p>    Sati: <br />    1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core <br />of <br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British never <br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have <br />  added more points below.)<br />    2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at <br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. <br />honestly <br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life <br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where <br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, <br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted <br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have <br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />  1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of <br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />  hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do <br />  with western explorers landing in India...)<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It ties <br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now <br />  where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<p>    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a <br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the <br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not <br />open. <br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />  1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new <br />  definition as caste politics now.</p>
<p>    Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan <br />kaamanai <br />  vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during <br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of <br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' <br />was <br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think <br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, <br />dating <br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model <br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex <br />is <br />  taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our <br />great <br />  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they <br />were <br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare <br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out <br />dated <br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) to <br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer <br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where <br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. <br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the <br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />  'talent'. </p>
<p>    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the <br />  African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious <br />comment <br />  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare <br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one <br />serious <br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations <br />in <br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country. </p>
<p>    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did, <br />  by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy <br />  trains vs the TUBE in london).<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant <br />management <br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like <br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have <br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the <br />british <br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as 'Oh Almighty British <br />- <br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat'.</p>
<p>    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on <br />india <br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read <br />  Kalki's<br />    comments on Churchill's thoughts on India. Make no mistake, <br />Britain <br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they <br />were <br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. </p>
<p>    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are <br />worthless <br />  and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India <br />  does<br />    not exist without the west. </p>
<p>    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain <br />is <br />  Europe's crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation <br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is <br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them <br />making <br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather <br />than <br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<p>    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more <br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor <br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.</p>
<p>    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real <br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british <br />able <br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were <br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have <br />an <br />  idea now. </p>

<p>    Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>    I would definitely be against all your points. What you <br />described, <br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the <br />  characteristics of india.</p>
<p>    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing <br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill <br />  of ourself.</p>
<p>    Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>    1) The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the <br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request <br />you <br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to <br />a <br />  women committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>    2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We <br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the <br />dress <br />  style is entirely different..</p>
<p>    3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower <br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the <br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<p>    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those <br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in <br />india, <br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation. </p>
<p>    4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />  ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools <br />in <br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />  today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />  all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>    You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /<br />3beautiful- <br />  tree.zip </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>    5) Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the <br />  western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th <br />  century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>    6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the <br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the <br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as <br />  sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. <br />the <br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism <br />effect.)</p>
<p>    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the <br />bharatanatyam, <br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like <br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam <br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded <br />to <br />  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<p>    7. Slavery:<br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of <br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>    8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>    Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close <br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the <br />  girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The <br />  girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her <br />  childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<p>    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />  days.</p>
<p>    "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in <br />the <br />  west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why <br />  it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>    9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, <br />and <br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every <br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested <br />with <br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />  vellalars.</p>
<p>    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be <br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of <br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few <br />  castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed <br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>    10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our <br />  mother tongues..</p>
<p>    11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the <br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its <br />sacrificed <br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. </p>
<p>    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated <br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own <br />  community (not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, <br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>    Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like <br />that, <br />  let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who <br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa <br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, <br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<p>    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br />    <http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one <br />  is barbaric. </p>
<p>    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really <br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of <br />our <br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going <br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a <br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, <br />  still india is our only land for us)</p>

<p>      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />      those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />      society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />      today, when compared with contemporary nations:</p>
<p>      1) The Sati system<br />      2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />      garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />      3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />      4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />      5) Fate of widows<br />      6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />      devadasi system<br />      7) Slavery<br />      8) Marriage at childhood<br />      9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />      10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />      11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>      But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />      main crux to be focussed. </p>
<p>      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

        <p>Excellent points Ravi and Senthil.</p>
<p>Many points have been misinterpretted or rather we were forced to <br />misbelive. <br />One tip of the ice berg...</p>
<p>Untouchability...As if the west do not have it. What is aparthied? <br />The whites never come in close contact with the blacks..even <br />today....In the west, if a white touches the black or the black <br />thouches the white, the black was severely punished..whipped <br />terribly or even killed.<br />But in India, as discussed,every clan kept away from others and even <br />if toched, the ritual was to punish ourselves by taking bath. We <br />never blame others and take things on us (though this has been <br />greatly changed in later times by behaving harsh to the other clan).</p>
<p>I too strongly belive that inspite of all goods the brits have done, <br />there wrongs have long lasting effect on us, even after so many <br />years.</p>

        <p>Sati was not a rule, even during the Kuru clan (1400 - 450 BC), satyavati ruled after her husband Vichitravirya's demise.<br />10th century rashtrakutas followed widow remiarrage.<br />Read for Niyoga on the topic of widows (jews and spartans practiced it too).<br />India treated her women with great importance and respect. Shakti worship is prominent. Dowry was issued by the groom to the family of bride prior to mairrage - so many documentation to that, please read the background of Shri Desika's Shree Lakshmi thudhi.<br />Sati was definitely optional and at some places, women who were under other pressures due to social factors were forced to sati.</p>
<p>Islamic rulers could not understand or accept many of our scriptures, they forced a lot of their rules. Then came the british and added to our woes. <br />All said and done, we have a lot of confused indians, believing in the west and their marketing / management strategies in degrading the country.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>this was discussed earlier:</p>
<p>Vaanavan maadevi - wife of sundara chozha (tirukkovilur malayaman <br />vamsam) - entered funeral pyre of her husband.</p>
<p>why sembiyan mahadeviyar did not commit sati ?</p>

        <p>Dear Venkatesh</p>
<p>Your view is of a burned down India, negative critic at the best. You can keep on complaining woefully that India would have been a bunch of tribals or a ill equiped lot of villages. Well, ask the remaining of community to see who can beat spielberg in recreating history.</p>
<p>Paying taxes or attending to schools were a force of rule. Looks like people such as your self would always prefer to be a slave to white skin and sing their lullaby anytime. </p>
<p>Give me a single reason:<br />Why would the so called tribal indians, who are barbaric and had been binded to so many social evils and did not speak 'one' language 'unite' against a massive british 'Godly' rule and take them down in the path that has NEVER ever before been done in the history of the world. What made these dumb guys so patriotic that they could not tolerate the british but could tolerate every other ruler even as horrible as aurangazeb ? </p>
<p>Oh I forgot, we were split into so many zamindars and duh how the heck did they all unite under a half naked man ? </p>
<p>Every country has its dark age, every economy has its fall, every kingdom has to crash, every corporate has to buckle sometime, law of nature. <br />5th century to 1000 AD was british dark age, India started from 1100 to 1700 - not as a dark age but as unstable period. 1300 - 1600 was mugal peak time, there were a lot of disturbances (many people opposing the mugal autocratic rule) during that time when the country was 'rediscovering' itself, which people like you conveniently call as ignorance. India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals ruled for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250. Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many states, so what ? US is 50+ states, china was so many states the biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma. Sanskrit was spoken widely before the british split us, tamil was in tamil heartland, we used to speak many languages in indian country. </p>
<p>Ghori / Ghazni plundered the country, we bounced back, mughals tried to break the hindu culture and failed miserably, Nadir shah ripped us we rebound back.... then came the british, fresh out of their dark age, exploring new territories looking for places were they can spread their culture, education (as if no one else was educated), systematically ripped us of our minds and caused people such as yourself who believe in their dominion after 60 years. Whilst you speak of us going the African way, why wont you think of us going the Chinese way ? There lies a mind set, again british preset.</p>
<p>India, an internal economy, there in was her strength, the british wanted to develop their country and started levying heavy taxes on Indian goods and exported european goods. Coincided with the industrial revolution in england...fact or fiction ? Read the Imperial Gazzetter of 1881:<br />some experts<br />1903-04 Data is Lakh Rupees (Rupees of that Era)<br />Items Imports Exports (Textile)<br />Apparels 172 16<br />Raw Cotton 5 2438<br />Cotton Goods 31288 10<br />Wool Items 215 27<br />My country paid (imported) Rs 31,680 lakhs and sold (exported) Rs.2500 lakh... rocket science on the numbers. This is only in textile, go for many many other imports and exports you will see that a billion of dollar value would be transfered every damn year for 100 years of british rule, and here we have patrons to be so happy with their rule.</p>
<p>Gandhi systematically counteracted them by dismantling their managerial capacities, hitting them where it mattered the most, Tata built its steel plant and rose against the empire, luckily for Tata, they happened to find customers in british during WW II. Gandhi and Tata worked closely in removing the steel trade of british from India. Check the public documents of Birmingham and Sheffield. <br />Next - salt, monopoly of salt trade, british hit us with that and that was when our power as a nation moved full surge ahead. <br />You can be proud that we helped england rebuild itself with our money. <br />And coming to think of the tribal chieftains, they are still available today... they just kept changing names.. from sitrarasan of chola period to chieftains of mugal rules to zamindars of british rule to MLA's of republic of India. We are still at war with our neighbors, for water for trade for space for land etc... We will always be at war, it is our family, we will come to a compromise today or tomorrow. your motive says that just because karnataka wont release water, get whites to rule us.... how cool! </p>
<p>This is a great country, no matter how many people work hard on demotivating us or plundering us, we will prove our mettle. One thing is for sure, it is immaterial if Maculay really said his famous quote in 1835, what is alleged definitely is happening today. They have successfully planted their domain in minds of many indians. It is another test for the great nation and I am sure she will come good as usual.</p>

<p>Hi Venu<br />I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid their <br />taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.</p>
<p>most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs who <br />saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh war. <br />the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful <br />nation called india in say 1600.<br />if you were born in 1600 ( or as you say 1970 if the british had not <br />come at all) you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of <br />pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of ramnad <br />or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of <br />madurai.<br />that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great show <br />of unity united on their own in the national interest and then opened <br />negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of <br />hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of tranvancore, <br />the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin. <br />this would have united south india.<br />then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern hindu <br />muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings( ar you will be <br />calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon) to <br />unite one democratic nation called india.<br />you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the sardar <br />to join the indian confedration.<br />the maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and <br />you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and pelf so <br />that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.</p>
<p>have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited <br />in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been <br />discussing.</p>
<p>to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should not <br />be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or the <br />slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un united <br />india.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>

<p>how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life <br />is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />treatment she gets even today.</p>

<p>there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.</p>

<p>lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of <br />compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do <br />with western explorers landing in India...)</p>

<p>middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not open. <br />Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new <br />definition as caste politics now.</p>

<p>the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of <br />Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' was <br />to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think <br />what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, dating <br />was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model <br />and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex is <br />taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our great <br />grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they were <br />children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare <br />the success of child</p>

<p>follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer <br />our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where <br />girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. <br />Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the <br />energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />'talent'. </p>

<p>or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare <br />India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one serious <br />literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations in <br />Africa is more or less degrading my country. </p>

<p>  Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>  I would definitely be against all your points. What you described, <br />may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the </p></blockquote>
<p>characteristics of india.</p>
<blockquote><p>  I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing <br />our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill </p></blockquote>
<p>of ourself.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>  1) The Sati system<br />  The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the women.<br />  Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request you </p></blockquote>
<p>to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to a <br />women committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<blockquote><p>  <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>  2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>  I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We </p></http://www.samanvay></p></blockquote>
<p>should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the dress <br />style is entirely different..</p>
<blockquote><p>  3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>  This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower </p></blockquote>
<p>caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the <br />SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those <br />semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in india, </p></blockquote>
<p>the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<blockquote><p>  The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation. </p>
<p>  4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>  Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools in </p></blockquote>
<p>Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>  You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>
<p>  <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /3beautiful- <br />tree.zip </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>  5) Fate of widows<br />  You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the </p></blockquote>
<p>western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th <br />century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<blockquote><p>  6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>  Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the </p></blockquote>
<p>devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.</p>
<blockquote><p>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>  The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the <br />highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as </p></blockquote>
<p>sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. the <br />concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism effect.)</p>
<blockquote><p>  See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the bharatanatyam, <br />were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like </p></blockquote>
<p>lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam </p></blockquote>
<p>cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded to <br />prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  7. Slavery:<br />  Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of <br />time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>  8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>  Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close </p></blockquote>
<p>relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the <br />girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The <br />girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her <br />childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />days.</p>
<p>  "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in the <br />west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>  If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why <br />it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>  9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>  Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, and <br />spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every </p></blockquote>
<p>profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested with <br />brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />vellalars.</p>
<blockquote><p>  also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be <br />priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of </p></blockquote>
<p>untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<blockquote><p>  So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few <br />castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed </p></blockquote>
<p>priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<blockquote><p>  10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>  This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our <br />mother tongues..</p>
<p>  11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>  Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the <br />animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its sacrificed </p></blockquote>
<p>in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated <br />slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />  Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own <br />community (not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, </p></blockquote>
<p>and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<blockquote><p>  Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>  Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like that, <br />let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>  we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>  I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who <br />committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa </p></blockquote>
<p>Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, <br />committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<blockquote><p>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br />  <http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>  Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one <br />is barbaric. </p>
<p>  No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really <br />a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of our </p></http://en.wikipedia></p></blockquote>
<p>culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going <br />to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a <br />paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, <br />still india is our only land for us)</p>

<p>    The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />    about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />    really spread to India through the Britishers.

<p>    1) The Sati system<br />    2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />    garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />    3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />    4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />    5) Fate of widows<br />    6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />    devadasi system<br />    7) Slavery<br />    8) Marriage at childhood<br />    9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />    10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />    11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>    But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />    main crux to be focussed. </p>
<p>    The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />    children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />    pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />    truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />    enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />    should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />    illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />    they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

        <p>Hi Venu<br />I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid their <br />taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.</p>
<p>most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs who <br />saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh war. <br />the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful <br />nation called india in say 1600.<br />if you were born in 1600 ( or as you say 1970 if the british had not <br />come at all) you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of <br />pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of ramnad <br />or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of <br />madurai.<br />that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great show <br />of unity united on their own in the national interest and then opened <br />negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of <br />hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of tranvancore, <br />the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin. <br />this would have united south india.<br />then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern hindu <br />muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings( ar you will be <br />calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon) to <br />unite one democratic nation called india.<br />you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the sardar <br />to join the indian confedration.<br />the maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and <br />you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and pelf so <br />that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.</p>
<p>have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited <br />in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been <br />discussing.</p>
<p>to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should not <br />be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or the <br />slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un united <br />india.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric <br />tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a </p></blockquote>
<p>shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... pathetic <br />and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how <br />people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence India <br />is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is <br />childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability, <br />child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly </p></blockquote>
<p>set afire by the British. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Sati: <br />  1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core of <br />issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British never </p></blockquote>
<p>allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have <br />added more points below.)</p>
<blockquote><p>  2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at <br />that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. honestly </p></blockquote>
<p>how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life <br />is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />treatment she gets even today.</p>
<blockquote><p>  We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where <br />there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, </p></blockquote>
<p>there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted <br />by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have </p></blockquote>
<p>lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of <br />compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do <br />with western explorers landing in India...)</p>
<blockquote><p>  Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It ties <br />up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now </p></blockquote>
<p>where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a <br />concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the </p></blockquote>
<p>middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not open. <br />Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new <br />definition as caste politics now.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan kaamanai <br />vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during </p></blockquote>
<p>the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of <br />Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' was <br />to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think <br />what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, dating <br />was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model <br />and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex is <br />taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our great <br />grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they were <br />children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare <br />the success of child</p>
<blockquote><p>  mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out dated <br />concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) to </p></blockquote>
<p>follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer <br />our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where <br />girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. <br />Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the <br />energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />'talent'. </p>
<blockquote><p>  A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the <br />African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious comment </p></blockquote>
<p>or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare <br />India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one serious <br />literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations in <br />Africa is more or less degrading my country.  </p>
<blockquote><p>  A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did, <br />by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy </p></blockquote>
<p>trains vs the TUBE in london).</p>
<blockquote><p>  There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant management <br />people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />  people everywhere...even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like <br />dyre or jackson the<br />  british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />  supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have <br />even<br />  caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the british <br />to rethink a motive. That<br />  is management strategy not to be confused as 'Oh Almighty British - <br />I see your Grace in the bread we eat'.</p>
<p>  Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />  patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on india <br />was<br />  definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read <br />Kalki's<br />  comments on Churchill's thoughts on India. Make no mistake, Britain <br />is a great country for the British, but to even think that they were </p></blockquote>
<p>the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>  Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are worthless <br />and sing<br />  hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India <br />does<br />  not exist without the west. </p>
<p>  Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />  equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain is <br />Europe's crime<br />  hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation <br />recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is </p></blockquote>
<p>like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them making <br />mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather than <br />adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<blockquote><p>  A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more worry.<br />  What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor citizens<br />  who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.</p>
<p>  I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real <br />Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>  On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british able <br />to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were </p></blockquote>
<p>Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have an <br />idea now. </p>

<p>  Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>  I would definitely be against all your points. What you described, <br />may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the </p></blockquote>
<p>characteristics of india.</p>
<blockquote><p>  I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing <br />our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill </p></blockquote>
<p>of ourself.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>  1) The Sati system<br />  The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history.  <br />Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the women.<br />  Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request you </p></blockquote>
<p>to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to a <br />women committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<blockquote><p>  <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>  2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>  I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We </p></http://www.samanvay></p></blockquote>
<p>should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the dress <br />style is entirely different..</p>
<blockquote><p>  3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>  This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts.  <br />Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower </p></blockquote>
<p>caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the <br />SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those <br />semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in india, </p></blockquote>
<p>the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<blockquote><p>  The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.  </p>
<p>  4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>  Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools in </p></blockquote>
<p>Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>  You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>
<p>  <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /3beautiful- <br />tree.zip </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>  5) Fate of widows<br />  You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the </p></blockquote>
<p>western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th <br />century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<blockquote><p>  6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>  Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the </p></blockquote>
<p>devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.</p>
<blockquote><p>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>  The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the <br />highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as </p></blockquote>
<p>sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. the <br />concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism effect.)</p>
<blockquote><p>  See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the bharatanatyam, <br />were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like </p></blockquote>
<p>lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam </p></blockquote>
<p>cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded to <br />prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  7. Slavery:<br />  Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of <br />time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>  8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>  Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close </p></blockquote>
<p>relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the <br />girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The <br />girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her <br />childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />days.</p>
<p>  "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in the <br />west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>  If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why <br />it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>  9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>  Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, and <br />spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every </p></blockquote>
<p>profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested with <br />brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />vellalars.</p>

<p>    The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />    about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />    really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />    those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />    society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />    today, when compared with contemporary nations:</p>
<p>    1) The Sati system<br />    2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />    garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />    3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />    4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />    5) Fate of widows<br />    6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />    devadasi system<br />    7) Slavery<br />    8) Marriage at childhood<br />    9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />    10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />    11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>    But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />    main crux to be focussed. </p>
<p>    The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />    children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />    pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />    truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />    enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />    should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />    illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />    they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a slightly different view on why British built infrastructure.</p>
<p>For reasons I do not know, whites (I am not using this in a derogatory<br />sense) have always stressed on clarity (they keep enhancing/creating<br />rules/definitions for everything) and infrastructure development. Focus on<br />inner growth too is done under strict frameworks - some times so strict that<br />they tried forcing it by the sword. I would presume that creating what they<br />created in India was sort-of second nature to them. We have benefited from<br />their language and the structures (political and physical) they left behind.<br />I would like to acknowledge that rather than take an offensive position.<br />India did not fail as a state - as said by others before, we never were a<br />single country. Even if we had, we need to only document why we failed so<br />that it does not happen in future. I am not able to think of any one large<br />country that has never failed.</p>
<p>In Asia, it was (until recently) the opposite - focus was on inner growth.<br />What kings did in terms of rules appears to have been just sufficient to<br />keep the governance machine running. Our rules have been simple and most are<br />implemented out of individual acceptance. The ones implemented<br />violently/strongly have not been exactly beneficial to the community. Caste<br />system being an example.</p>
<p>These days, we seem to be drifting towards a typical materialistic society.<br />Not that there is anything wrong with it. But, a few generations will have<br />painful transitions - e.g. old age homes.</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Senthil</p>
<p>I am glad to see that some one had pointed out every gritty detail before I woke up this morning :-) .<br />Excellent notes. </p>
<p>Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... pathetic and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence India is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<p>Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability, child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly set afire by the British. </p>
<p>Sati: <br />1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core of issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British never allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have added more points below.)<br />2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. honestly how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of treatment she gets even today.<br />We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the 1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do with western explorers landing in India...)<br />Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It ties up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<p>Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not open. Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a 1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new definition as caste politics now.</p>
<p>Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan kaamanai vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' was to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, dating was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex is taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our great grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they were children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare the success of child<br />mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out dated concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) to follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into 'talent'. </p>
<p>A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious comment or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one serious literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations in Africa is more or less degrading my country. </p>
<p>A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did, by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy trains vs the TUBE in london).<br />There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant management people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />people everywhere...even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like dyre or jackson the<br />british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have even<br />caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the british to rethink a motive. That<br />is management strategy not to be confused as 'Oh Almighty British - I see your Grace in the bread we eat'.</p>
<p>Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on india was<br />definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read Kalki's<br />comments on Churchill's thoughts on India. Make no mistake, Britain is a great country for the British, but to even think that they were the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. </p>
<p>Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are worthless and sing<br />hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India does<br />not exist without the west. </p>
<p>Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain is Europe's crime<br />hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them making mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather than adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<p>A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more worry.<br />What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor citizens<br />who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.</p>
<p>I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british able to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have an idea now. </p>

<p>Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>I would definitely be against all your points. What you described, may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the characteristics of india.</p>
<p>I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill of ourself.</p>
<p>Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>1) The Sati system<br />The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the women.<br />Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request you to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to a women committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<p><http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the dress style is entirely different..</p>
<p>3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<p>Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in india, the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation. </p>
<p>4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools in Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.<br />The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>
<p><http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /3beautiful- tree.zip </p>
<p>5) Fate of widows<br />You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. the concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism effect.)</p>
<p>See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the bharatanatyam, were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded to prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<p>7. Slavery:<br />Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<p>Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those days.</p>
<p>"When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in the west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, and spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested with brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with vellalars.</p>
<p>also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our mother tongues..</p>
<p>11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its sacrificed in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. </p>
<p>Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own community (not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like that, let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br /><http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one is barbaric. </p>
<p>No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of our culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, still india is our only land for us)</p>

<blockquote><p>  The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />  about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />  really spread to India through the Britishers.

<p>  1) The Sati system<br />  2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />  garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />  3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />  4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />  5) Fate of widows<br />  6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />  devadasi system<br />  7) Slavery<br />  8) Marriage at childhood<br />  9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />  10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />  11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>  But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />  main crux to be focussed. </p>
<p>  The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />  children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />  pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />  truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />  enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />  should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />  illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />  they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p></blockquote>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Thanks for your comments. Exactly the same I wished<br />our politicians better but they become worst and made<br />their predecessor better.</p>
<p>Robbery is nothing but loot everything as possible and<br />leave empty as possible.</p>
<p>I wouldn't imagine British left Hongkong empty after<br />they tookover as village before 100 years. This is<br />valid for Chennai/Mumbai.</p>
<p>The fact was India was in disarray in hands of <br />kings/cheiftains with lack of vision.</p>
<p>Indian kings were divided all the times and that was<br />the reason they last many wars and made tumultuous<br />history to India.</p>
<p>Kings lacked vision and didn't colsolidate power to<br />oust any alien invasion. This is true for King<br />Prithviraj. Complete misery.</p>
<p>Chola empire, Maratta/Vijayanagar kingdoms were<br />relief. British were relief ousting Mughals.</p>
<p>British occupied, indulged and defended India during<br />WWII.</p>
<p>Conservative party lost election after WWII because<br />labour party's policy was "UK unnecessarily mobilizing<br />armed forces to defend colonies endangered UK home<br />nations. So UK should free the colonies and safeguard<br />UK". Labour party's Clement Attlee become prime<br />minister and WWII champion Churchill's conservative<br />party lost election. India won independence.</p>
<p>I am not supporting British atrocities but they were<br />better if you compared with present politicians and<br />Mughals.</p>
<p>Instead of making citizens are stake holders of the<br />country our politicians making our people poorer and<br />poorer. They already created voters pockets on each<br />constituency. They effectively use whenever possible<br />"divide and rule".</p>

<blockquote><p>  British did India no favor by building rails or<br />  bridges, they did it for their own cause for the<br />  'long haul', unfortunately they bumped into some<br />  road blocks in name of genuine freedom fighters such<br />  as Gandhi , Patel , Bharathi and Bose etc. Our<br />  politicians are following the footsteps of brits so<br />  they are no good. North south divide - hindu muslim<br />  rift - language barriers etc was all done by brits.<br />  They did that over a period of 100 years, they never<br />  fixed anything, they ignited a time bomb that will<br />  put them totally in control at any point of our<br />  life. They were interested in archeology not to<br />  build indian history but to track and posses the<br />  wealth we had.</p>
<p>  They stole our money, our morals, our values and<br />  everything we had, they left us in such a dire state<br />  that we landed up with politicians who work exactly<br />  like the british.<br />  The crown was nothing short of a petty criminal. </p>
<p>  Today, they repent, who says nations do not have<br />  consequence. No kingdom can rule for a long period,<br />  every single atom that is born has an expiry date<br />  and the brits are feeling for their misdeeds while<br />  slaving poor countries.</p>

<p>  I think our history systematically ignored in north<br />  after independence.</p>
<p>  As far as I know British are good for<br />  uniting/building<br />  India.</p>
<p>  Politicians are rubbish systematically killed good<br />  governance left by British.</p>
<p>  I remember one bridge collapsed during 1997-1999<br />  near<br />  Chennai on east coast road constructed at that time.<br />  The comedy was authorities tried to demolish(by<br />  blasting) old bridge built by British didn't<br />  collpase<br />  but due to impact on the new bridge completely<br />  fallen.</p>
<p>  The whole day I was unable to control my laugh<br />  reading<br />  this funny!</p>
<p>  So post independence Indian politics/governance<br />  infact<br />  worsened itself made British better like the above<br />  incident.</p>
<p>  There were 180 ponds/lakes until 1947 in Chennai<br />  effectively helping water supply/drainage. All<br />  become<br />  residential areas and nowadays in Chennai, rain <br />  making 1000 lakes. What a reverse comedy!!</p>
<p>  I am not justifying British atrocities but the "We<br />  OUR" done/doing more atrocities.</p>

<p>    The fact of KAN and Kalki are absolutely true.<br />    But I disagree on Brits. they tampered with our<br />    history so much that RRC and RJC are not even<br />  known<br />    up north as much as how much Shivaji or<br />    Harshavardhana are known in the south.<br />    British had systematically killed our history and<br />    tampered with the future of young minds that got<br />    eventually misled.<br />    I guess, my hatred for the crown still lives :-) </p>

<p>    We should definitely record our appreciation and<br />    gratitude to the <br />    British for having shown keenness in knowing<br />  Indian<br />    History, <br />    particularly the South Indian History - through<br />    epigrahy - thanks to <br />    the efforts of their renowned Archeologists - like<br />    Heultz and others.</p>
<p>    They have furnished unbiased History from what<br />  they<br />    have decyphered.</p>
<p>    Venkayya and other epigraphists assisted them in<br />    great way. But they <br />    had details of various inscriptions. Not much<br />    co-related.</p>
<p>    KA Neelakanta Sastry, who was Professor in Madras<br />  /<br />    Mysore <br />    Universities, assembled almost every piece of<br />    inscription and given <br />    shape to HISTORY of Southern India!</p>
<p>    His " The Colas" is a manumental work.</p>
<p>    Subsequently Sadasiva Pandarathar of Annamalai<br />    University came out <br />    with his book Chozhar varalaaru .. followed by Dr.<br />    Maa. <br />    Raasamaanickanar.</p>
<p>    This is the Greatness of KAN.</p>
<p>    Among several thousand such inscriptions, Kalki<br />    chose one inscription <br />    from Udayarkudi @ Kaatumannargudi (which is<br />  located<br />    on the banks of <br />    Veeranam lake - just one KM north of Veeranarayana<br />    perumal temple) - <br />    which was published by KAN Sastry in Epigraphia<br />    Indica and wrote the <br />    magnum opus PONNIYINSELVAN.</p>
<p>    This inscription is still there on the Northern<br />  wall<br />    of the sanctum of <br />    Anantheeswarar temple - wherein the 4 characters<br />    namely Ravidasan - <br />    Parameswaran and his two other brothers figure<br />  along<br />    with Aditha <br />    karikalan !</p>
<p>    We have extensively discussed this : check<br />    Udayarkudi inscriptions / <br />    Aditha karikalan murder etc., etc., in the<br />    Archieves.</p>
<p>    Iamgine KALKI wrote 5 volumes on one inscription -<br />    published and <br />    narrated by KAN !</p>
<p>    That is the Greatness of Kalki. </p>
<p>    Both are complimentary to each other ..</p>

        <p>-Hi<br />everybody is entitled to his opinion and there is no point getting <br />personal or emotional about it.</p>
<p>that was a long reply and befor vk replies i'll just like to add <br />santayana's statement on history</p>
<p>'those who ignore the lessons of histroy are forced to repeat it"</p>
<p>just brushing under the carpet all our minus points wont make us a <br />confident indian.<br />its just hogwash.<br />the first step towards solving a problem is recognising there is a <br />problem.</p>
<p>we had all these problems, slavery, women diempowerment, devadasi <br />system,. all of them were great social problems. justifying them or <br />placing the blame on muslim invaders wont do any good.</p>
<p>in your account anybody who talks about nandigram or polic excesses <br />in kashmir is unpatriotic.<br />its a very wrong approach to hide behind a shield of so called <br />patriotism when mistakes are pointed out.<br />i guess a true patriot is one who realises there are follies in his <br />society and points out to them bravely.</p>
<p>its not really a continuation of slave mentality as you point out.</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>I would definitely be against all your points. What you described, may<br />have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the<br />characteristics of india.</p>
<p>I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing our<br />territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill of<br />ourself.</p>
<p>Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>1) The Sati system<br />The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the women.<br />Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain areas of<br />North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request you to read a<br />first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to a women<br />committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<p><http://www.samanvaya.com/dharampal/frames/downloads/vol1.pdf </p>
<p>2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards this<br />started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We should<br />also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the dress style is<br />entirely different..</p>
<p>3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower caste. <br />Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the SC castes<br />do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<p>Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those<br />semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in india,<br />the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the semitic<br />concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.</p>
<p>4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your ignorance. As<br />per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools in Bengal province. <br />Almost all villages had schools, and most of today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC<br />castes received education.<br />The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in all<br />over madras presidency.</p>
<p>You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>
<p><http://www.samanvaya.com/dharampal/frames/downloads/3beautiful-tree.zip\</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></http://www.samanvaya.com/dharampal/frames/downloads/3beautiful-tree.zip\</p></p>
<p>5) Fate of widows<br />You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But they<br />had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the western<br />nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th century, we had<br />adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system were<br />meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the devadaasis<br />enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devadasi" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devadasi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devadasi</a></p>
<p>The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the highly<br />narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as sin. (whereas<br />in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and devadasis, while<br />enjoying high status, also had the privilege of choosing her partner. <br />Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. the concept of brahmacharya<br />and celebacy came only after buddhism effect.)</p>
<p>See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the bharatanatyam, were<br />pioneered by devadaasis,.. Many of the popular artists, like lata<br />mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as prostitutes..<br />Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam cannot originate from a<br />prostitutes.. The devadasis are degraded to prostitution, because of<br />loss of their patronage, during British rule, as they took over all<br />sources of wealth.</p>
<p>7. Slavery:<br />Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of time..<br />probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a<br />usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close relatives<br />till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the girl child<br />should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The girl child grows<br />as part of her husband's family, right from her childhood and get<br />adapted to it.</p>
<p>Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those days.</p>
<p>"When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in the west<br />even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why it is<br />considered as evil.</p>
<p>9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, and<br />spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every<br />profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested with<br />brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with<br />vellalars.</p>
<p>also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be<br />priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of untouchability,<br />gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few castes<br />are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed priestly<br />hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our mother<br />tongues..</p>
<p>11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the<br />animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its sacrificed in<br />temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer..</p>
<p>Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated slaughtering<br />house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own community<br />(not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, and killing<br />thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like that, let's<br />stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who committed<br />numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa Inquisition is one<br />of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, committed by the europeans. <br />Refer the below links.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition</a><br /><http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition </p>
<p>Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one is<br />barbaric.</p>
<p>No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really a<br />continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of our<br />culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going to<br />achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a paradise in<br />the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, still india is our<br />only land for us)</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Senthil Raja</p>

<p>  The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />  children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />  pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />  truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />  enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />  should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />  illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />  they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p></blockquote>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>-Hi</p>
<p>I would like to point out some actions taken by the british <br />government and people against some of their officials who were said <br />to have looted india.</p>
<p>robert Clive had to defend his actions against his numerous and <br />vocal critics in Britain. Cross-examined by a Parliament suspicious <br />of his vast wealth, he claimed to have taken relatively limited <br />advantage of the opportunities presented to him: "By God...I stand <br />astonished at my own moderation".<br />Despite his vindication, on 22 November 1774 he committed suicide at <br />his Berkeley Square home in London by stabbing himself with a pen-<br />knife.</p>
<p>warren hastings was impeached ( though later acquitted)<br />dyer- the butcher of jalinwala bagh was put up before a commmision</p>
<p>even jackson durai is reported to have been suspended for <br />antagonising kattabomman.</p>
<p>it is so heart warming when we see black and white pictures of gandhi <br />being welcomed by the comon man in uk during the round table <br />conference. <br />inspite of all the politics indians share a rare warmth with the <br />british and the commonwealth because our founding fathers realised <br />another colonial ruler would have been worser.</p>
<p>it is not a question of english or indians.people all over the world <br />get mesmerised by power.</p>
<p>right now we have extra judicial killings in kashmir and the north <br />east. human rights violations in nandigram. <br />though some of these can be justly compared to the british actions, <br />they may be worse as these are by a democratically elected government <br />against the people who have to be protected by them. <br />after all the british had conquered a territory and it was in their <br />interests to hold on to it, just as it is our aim to get it released.</p>
<p>I wish people would read kalki's article praising the british for <br />their bravery during the nazi bombing. how he could segregate issues <br />was fantastic.</p>

<p>    what did the british break up?<br />    what except a geographic cohesion link us even<br />    today.<br />    if you feel our terrorism and day to day problems<br />    are due to the <br />    british you are mistaken. <br />    we are just making him a bogey man for everything.</p>
<p>    i am not ridiculing our freedom fighters. but how<br />    many of them if <br />    alive today will like the state of affairs in the<br />    country.<br />    do you think they would be happy.<br />    when the british left there were 500 states. ( if<br />    they had not come <br />    at all there would have ben a 1500)states the<br />    average size of nepal <br />    and some like hyderabad bigger than many european<br />    states. they had a <br />    great chance of surviving today.<br />    the smaller ones would have been gobbled up by the<br />    bigger ones but we <br />    would definitely not have had one entity caled<br />    india.<br />    there would have been a perpetual blood bath in this<br />    part of the <br />    world. we would have become like central africa.</p>

If you <br />    believe the power of the nawab empire would stand<br />    for ages, that will <br />    be a wildest guess in the reverse. Akbhar tried to<br />    create a blend by <br />    evoking Din-i-illahi, which never progressed any<br />    further than <br />    himself. Aurangazeb could not survive by force. Our<br />    country accepts <br />    any religion not due to fear but due to tolerance<br />    and we see God in <br />    every thing, every one. Make no mistake, what our<br />    freedom fighters <br />    achieved was impossible by any one else to achieve.<br />    'If' and ONLY if<br />    , the nawabs ruled, they would have done for not<br />    more than 1900's at <br />    the most. </p>
<p>      Going back to British, they are single handedly<br />    responsible for <br />    creating a rift in Sinhala - Tamil relations and how<br />    can one ever <br />    forget the role they played in Kashmir... so sub<br />    continent unity is a <br />    bad thought. </p>

<p>      On education, true we faltered in between post<br />    Roman cycle, it <br />    happens with any civilization as old as India, but<br />    truth is, we were <br />    kings in knowledge by the time our western peers<br />    were trying to <br />    figure out how to write. You seem to be of the wrong<br />    impression that <br />    the British rebuilt India.... British were<br />    opportunists and used <br />    territory break ups to build their regime, as an<br />    unwanted 'side' <br />    effect, we got united. Which would have happened<br />    anyways, with or <br />    without the british. </p>
<p>      PS: Even for the remotest of argument sake or for<br />    mildest of humor, <br />    please do not ridicule our freedom fighters. The<br />    sarcasm in 'your <br />    great freedom fighters' is definitely not in good<br />    humor. Please <br />    correct me if I am wrong. </p>

<p>who work exactly like the british.</p>
<p>in fact churchilll warned against giving freedom to india because it <br />would land into the hands of stuuffed strawbags. thats pexcisedly <br />what hapened.</p>
<p>when we plame them for partition do we praise them for uniting the <br />sub continent 100 years back.</p>
<p>when you curse the brits you should also look into the alternative. <br />maharajas who squeezed the country, hindus paying the jizia tax, a <br />country whose 90 % had no access to education.</p>
<p>we cant just curse the brits and blame them for everything.</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />today, when compared with contemporary nations:</p>
<p>1) The Sati system<br />2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />5) Fate of widows<br />6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />devadasi system<br />7) Slavery<br />8) Marriage at childhood<br />9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />main crux to be focussed. </p>
<p>The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi You have raised a rather contreversial point</p>
<p>yes the British did India no favor by building rails or bridges, <br />they did it for their own cause <br />but imagine the infrastructure they leftus with.</p>
<p>Our politicians are following <br />the footsteps of brits so they are no good. </p>
<p>this I think is the greatest insult to the bristish.</p>
<p>North south divide - <br />hindu muslim rift - language barriers etc was all done by brits. </p>
<p>no sir.<br />the only times the hindus and muslims united were during 1857. till <br />then they were chopping each other heads off<br />if the british hadnt come we would be living in a nawabs teritory and <br />speaking persian. your great freedom fighters wouldnt have stood a <br />chance against them.</p>
<p>They were interested in archeology not to build <br />indian history but to track and posses the wealth we had.</p>
<p>if the british had not discovered the fact you would still be <br />thinking thtat big tmple was built by kariklan. that was the <br />prevalent thought before the brits discoverd it.</p>
<blockquote><p>  They stole our money, our morals, our values and everything we had, <br />they left us in such a dire state that we landed up with politicians </p></blockquote>
<p>who work exactly like the british.</p>
<p>in fact churchilll warned against giving freedom to india because it <br />would land into the hands of stuuffed strawbags. thats pexcisedly <br />what hapened.</p>
<p>when we plame them for partition do we praise them for uniting the <br />sub continent 100 years back.</p>
<p>when you curse the brits you should also look into the alternative. <br />maharajas who squeezed the country, hindus paying the jizia tax, a <br />country whose 90 % had no access to education.</p>
<p>we cant just curse the brits and blame them for everything.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>British did India no favor by building rails or bridges, they did it for their own cause for the 'long haul', unfortunately they bumped into some road blocks in name of genuine freedom fighters such as Gandhi , Patel , Bharathi and Bose etc. Our politicians are following the footsteps of brits so they are no good. North south divide - hindu muslim rift - language barriers etc was all done by brits. They did that over a period of 100 years, they never fixed anything, they ignited a time bomb that will put them totally in control at any point of our life. They were interested in archeology not to build indian history but to track and posses the wealth we had.</p>
<p>They stole our money, our morals, our values and everything we had, they left us in such a dire state that we landed up with politicians who work exactly like the british.<br />The crown was nothing short of a petty criminal. </p>
<p>Today, they repent, who says nations do not have consequence. No kingdom can rule for a long period, every single atom that is born has an expiry date and the brits are feeling for their misdeeds while slaving poor countries.</p>

<p>I think our history systematically ignored in north<br />after independence.</p>
<p>As far as I know British are good for uniting/building<br />India.</p>
<p>Politicians are rubbish systematically killed good<br />governance left by British.</p>
<p>I remember one bridge collapsed during 1997-1999 near<br />Chennai on east coast road constructed at that time.<br />The comedy was authorities tried to demolish(by<br />blasting) old bridge built by British didn't collpase<br />but due to impact on the new bridge completely fallen.</p>
<p>The whole day I was unable to control my laugh reading<br />this funny!</p>
<p>So post independence Indian politics/governance infact<br />worsened itself made British better like the above<br />incident.</p>
<p>There were 180 ponds/lakes until 1947 in Chennai<br />effectively helping water supply/drainage. All become<br />residential areas and nowadays in Chennai, rain <br />making 1000 lakes. What a reverse comedy!!</p>
<p>I am not justifying British atrocities but the "We<br />OUR" done/doing more atrocities.</p>

<blockquote><p>  The fact of KAN and Kalki are absolutely true.<br />  But I disagree on Brits. they tampered with our<br />  history so much that RRC and RJC are not even known<br />  up north as much as how much Shivaji or<br />  Harshavardhana are known in the south.<br />  British had systematically killed our history and<br />  tampered with the future of young minds that got<br />  eventually misled.<br />  I guess, my hatred for the crown still lives :-) </p>

<p>  We should definitely record our appreciation and<br />  gratitude to the <br />  British for having shown keenness in knowing Indian<br />  History, <br />  particularly the South Indian History - through<br />  epigrahy - thanks to <br />  the efforts of their renowned Archeologists - like<br />  Heultz and others.</p>
<p>  They have furnished unbiased History from what they<br />  have decyphered.</p>
<p>  Venkayya and other epigraphists assisted them in<br />  great way. But they <br />  had details of various inscriptions. Not much<br />  co-related.</p>
<p>  KA Neelakanta Sastry, who was Professor in Madras /<br />  Mysore <br />  Universities, assembled almost every piece of<br />  inscription and given <br />  shape to HISTORY of Southern India!</p>
<p>  His " The Colas" is a manumental work.</p>
<p>  Subsequently Sadasiva Pandarathar of Annamalai<br />  University came out <br />  with his book Chozhar varalaaru .. followed by Dr.<br />  Maa. <br />  Raasamaanickanar.</p>
<p>  This is the Greatness of KAN.</p>
<p>  Among several thousand such inscriptions, Kalki<br />  chose one inscription <br />  from Udayarkudi @ Kaatumannargudi (which is located<br />  on the banks of <br />  Veeranam lake - just one KM north of Veeranarayana<br />  perumal temple) - <br />  which was published by KAN Sastry in Epigraphia<br />  Indica and wrote the <br />  magnum opus PONNIYINSELVAN.</p>
<p>  This inscription is still there on the Northern wall<br />  of the sanctum of <br />  Anantheeswarar temple - wherein the 4 characters<br />  namely Ravidasan - <br />  Parameswaran and his two other brothers figure along<br />  with Aditha <br />  karikalan !</p>
<p>  We have extensively discussed this : check<br />  Udayarkudi inscriptions / <br />  Aditha karikalan murder etc., etc., in the<br />  Archieves.</p>
<p>  Iamgine KALKI wrote 5 volumes on one inscription -<br />  published and <br />  narrated by KAN !</p>
<p>  That is the Greatness of Kalki. </p>
<p>  Both are complimentary to each other ..</p>
