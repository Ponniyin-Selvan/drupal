<p>famine was common in india. though just after bharathi's death in <br />1942, 5 million people died in bengal of hunger and related causes</p>
<p>more than the population of many countries.</p>
<p>bharathi had truly outline the priorities.</p>
<p>in women's lib and hunger we have exceeded whatever he thought and <br />sought for us</p>

<p>-- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "R.venketesh" <abhivencat@...  <br />wrote:</abhivencat@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  when he sang "Thani manithanuku una<br />    villayenil Jagathnai azlithivum" </p>
<p>  I am using your quote for another observation.</p>
<p>  bharathi lived during a time of famines and mass starvation deaths.</p>
<p>  he must have been proud of india today inspite of all our ills and <br />  ailments, corruption and what not.</p>
<p>  we have done extremely well in the path bharathi envisioned for us.</p>
<p>  he would'nt have found a reason to destroy this world on account of <br />  indians.</p>

<p>      Hi;       &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We are <br />  discussing his<br />      poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's are one <br />  of our<br />      greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect (among <br />quite <br />  a few<br />      people), there are statues, places named after the great poet. <br />  School books<br />      have ensured his immortality making sure almost every kid <br />learns <br />  his poems<br />      during the all important childhood even though they are not too <br />  inclined to<br />      teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i have <br />left <br />  out a few<br />      more things.</></p>
<p>      Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought to do <br />for <br />  a poet?<br />      There are instances where somebody has unintentionally been <br />  disrespectful of<br />      this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our hands <br />to <br />  ensure that<br />      these poems dont fade away with this generation but continue to <br />  inspire more<br />      generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>      Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he was a bad <br />  father and<br />      dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would have <br />  admired his<br />      poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be earning? I <br />  know his<br />      priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but then why <br />did <br />  he marry?!<br />      Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had commited <br />  suicide and<br />      Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been discussin <br />  him!! I<br />      think it is his wife who has not been getting the accolades she <br />  deserves!!!</p>

<p>        Being a poet, the options to earn are very few in those days. <br />  There is<br />        no<br />        film industry to earn and live in luxary. He has to sing to <br />the <br />  kings<br />        and zamindars of those days, who themselfs were lying at the <br />  feet of<br />        british.<br />        His pride would have killed him to sing to those guys.</p>

<p>          I agree with Mr.Venketesh. Bharathi is certainly getting <br />a <br />  lot of<br />          accolades these days than when he was alive. As <br />Mr.Venketesh <br />  said he<br />          dint even feed his family, a duty which is of primary <br />  importance.</p>

<p>  For the matter of fact, I have heard that Chellama Bharathi was <br />not <br />  like the chellamma portrayed in the movie Bharathi.

Im sure i have left <br />out a few<br />    more things.</></p>
<p>    Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought to do for <br />a poet?<br />    There are instances where somebody has unintentionally been <br />disrespectful of<br />    this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our hands to <br />ensure that<br />    these poems dont fade away with this generation but continue to <br />inspire more<br />    generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>    Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he was a bad <br />father and<br />    dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would have <br />admired his<br />    poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be earning? I <br />know his<br />    priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but then why did <br />he marry?!<br />    Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had commited <br />suicide and<br />    Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been discussin <br />him!! I<br />    think it is his wife who has not been getting the accolades she <br />deserves!!!</p>

<p>      What is the accolade Bharathi got these days? We discussing his <br />poems on<br />      birth anniversary or being mentioned in the school text books?</p>

<p>        I agree with Mr.Venketesh. Bharathi is certainly getting a <br />lot of<br />        accolades these days than when he was alive. As Mr.Venketesh <br />said he<br />        dint even feed his family, a duty which is of primary <br />importance.</p>

        <p>On the topic of 'greats' being criticised by their family, well said <br />Arun.</p>
<p>And Sivaram's and SPS's mail about vivekananda - Vivekananda took <br />sanyasa, when his father had died, family was in debts, starving for <br />one meal a day etc. When his father was alive, Vivekanada's family <br />lived like kings. So his family will say that he deceived them and <br />left them in 'nadu theru'. </p>
<p>For the matter of fact, I have heard that Chellama Bharathi was not <br />like the chellamma portrayed in the movie Bharathi. She used to enjoy <br />his poems and Bharathi used to read all his poesm first to her. They <br />did share a good family life. Poverty - paramparai sothu of pulavars.</p>
<p>Harikrishnan of Marabilakkiyam, author of 'Anuman - Varpum Vanappum, a <br />well know tamil literary person in teh internet world, can talk for <br />hours on Bharathi. GOod discussion on this topic can be found in <br />the 'marabilakkiya' yahoo group.</p>

        <p>I was just trying to say the Bharathi is definitely getting more accolades<br />these days than he did when he was. For example here about 25-30 people are<br />discussing about him on his anniversary while only 7 were present during his<br />funeral. That should be proof enough.</p>
<p>I think the final para in my last mail awoke a lot of Bharathis! ;) ;)</p>

<p>    Rahul,</p>
<p>    I think great people all have their faults and one would find many<br />  "greats"<br />    who all let down their own families - Buddha, Mahatma Gandhi,<br />  Bharathiyar,<br />    etc etc. I suppose if one were to ask Buddha's wife and son (Rahul<br />    incidentally ;)), their views about his greatness might be mixed. So I<br />    suppose there is always a trade-off: A "great"'s ultimate effect on<br />  humanity<br />    vs his/her effect on immediate family members. You can add many to that<br />    list. Meerabai (we would consider a woman who leaves her husband,<br />  thinks she<br />    is married to a deity in a temple, mad - these days); Ramana<br />  Maharishi - his<br />    mother would probably not have been very pleased etc etc :)</p>
<p>    Cheers,</p>
<p>    Arun</p>

<p>      Hi;       &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We are<br />  discussing his<br />      poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's are one of our<br />      greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect (among quite a few<br />      people), there are statues, places named after the great poet.<br />  School books<br />      have ensured his immortality making sure almost every kid learns<br />  his poems<br />      during the all important childhood even though they are not too<br />  inclined to<br />      teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i have left<br />  out a few<br />      more things.</></p>
<p>      Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought to do for<br />  a poet?<br />      There are instances where somebody has unintentionally been<br />  disrespectful of<br />      this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our hands to<br />  ensure that<br />      these poems dont fade away with this generation but continue to<br />  inspire more<br />      generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>      Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he was a bad<br />  father and<br />      dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would have admired his<br />      poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be earning? I<br />  know his<br />      priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but then why did<br />  he marry?!<br />      Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had commited<br />  suicide and<br />      Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been discussin<br />  him!! I<br />      think it is his wife who has not been getting the accolades she<br />  deserves!!!</p>

<p>Well said, Satish. Bharathi - Well ahead of his times..</p>
<p>Dear sivaram kannan : Swami Vivekananda was popular because of<br />cultural and religious roots of India. Was appealed to the Youth of<br />then India.</p>
<p>Actor Rajnikanth is also popular in his own way. Is appealing to the<br />Youth of Yuva India / Japan (?).</p>
<p>No doubt a Swamiji practises and preaches - cultural and religeous<br />values about 100 years back to the Youth (whose families were already<br />aware of such things).  </p>
<p>But imagine an Actor doing this subtly to present Indian Youth:<br />ARUNACHALAM - PADYAPPA - (MURUGA ) - BABA - to the Youth who are given<br />access to Western Modernisation.</p>
<p>While we are grudging that Tamilnadu is being ruled by Moviedom for<br />the past 30 year+ , Ronald Regan / Arnold are also NOT negatived by<br />the Oldest Democracy of the World.</p>
<p>But here I am confining only to Rajnikanth .. he is different and unique. <br />Pls bear with me for getting diverted.</p>

        <p>Rahul,</p>
<p>I think great people all have their faults and one would find many "greats"<br />who all let down their own families - Buddha, Mahatma Gandhi, Bharathiyar,<br />etc etc. I suppose if one were to ask Buddha's wife and son (Rahul<br />incidentally ;)), their views about his greatness might be mixed. So I<br />suppose there is always a trade-off: A "great"'s ultimate effect on humanity<br />vs his/her effect on immediate family members. You can add many to that<br />list. Meerabai (we would consider a woman who leaves her husband, thinks she<br />is married to a deity in a temple, mad - these days); Ramana Maharishi - his<br />mother would probably not have been very pleased etc etc :)</p>

        <p>Yes, I agree Bhrathi was not an ideal father nor an ideal husband.</p>
<p>Hope you are aware of the situation when he sang "Thani manithanuku una<br />villayenil Jagathnai azlithivum" (pardon my english tamil, ). Can you<br />imagine the plight of the man for this? It came out of his inability to feed<br />himself and his family. It came out of his helpless in the society that did<br />not help him. I belive Bharathi cannot be blamed for this.

        <p>Hi; &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We are discussing his<br />poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's are one of our<br />greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect (among quite a few<br />people), there are statues, places named after the great poet. School books<br />have ensured his immortality making sure almost every kid learns his poems<br />during the all important childhood even though they are not too inclined to<br />teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i have left out a few<br />more things.</></p>
<p>Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought to do for a poet?<br />There are instances where somebody has unintentionally been disrespectful of<br />this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our hands to ensure that<br />these poems dont fade away with this generation but continue to inspire more<br />generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he was a bad father and<br />dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would have admired his<br />poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be earning? I know his<br />priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but then why did he marry?!<br />Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had commited suicide and<br />Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been discussin him!! I<br />think it is his wife who has not been getting the accolades she deserves!!!</p>

<p>    I agree with Mr.Venketesh. Bharathi is certainly getting a lot of<br />    accolades these days than when he was alive. As Mr.Venketesh said he<br />    dint even feed his family, a duty which is of primary importance.</p>

        <p>-<br />Sathish<br />you are a trifle pessimistic arent you.</p>
<p>the man from an ordinary family. died a pauper. left behind a <br />destitute family whom he couldnt even feed properly during his <br />lifetimes.</p>
<p>held no post or wielded any power and 125 years have passed since he <br />was born.<br />still we hear his patriotic poem and blood races thro the veins like <br />volcanic lava.<br />we hear his romantic poem and remember the times we loved and lost</p>
<p>we hear his poem on social upliftment and are happy our country has <br />achieved that.</p>
<p>125 years is a long time and a man from the past being a part of our <br />lives is by itself a great tribute.</p>
<p>I dont think we have erred in our duties to a dead bharathi as our <br />forefathers did when he was alive.</p>
