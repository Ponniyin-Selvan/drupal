</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Jean-luc<br />I stand corrected what I meant was the machavillian man machine of Elizabeth I</p>
<p>in terms of the war efforts in Tamil fiction Sandilyan probably is the bestas he invest a lot of time and effort in those descriptions...<br />The arrangements of the fortifications in Poompuhar...</p>
<p>The Viyuhams like Sarpaviyuham and Garudaviyuhams in the final war as well as the war machinary of the greeks...in YavanaRani</p>
<p>Like wise he goes to town about the various ships in KadalPura the Agramanthiram,sarpamandhiram....the various female ships their design etc...</p>
<p>Kalki's way of writing keeps the reader engaged I beg to differ from some members writing you skip pages in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ...actually you will more with Sandilyanas he goes on and on on his varnanais...</p>
<p>We cannot compare the western authors to ours as the readership varies...even as a avid reader of english fiction I couldnt understand a few bits of crichtons mathematics but could readily follow Robin Cook or Crichtons medicine based books....so the background matters...the average reader's IQ without sounding arrogant is satisfied with Archer and Sheldon....Sheldon does describe Mining in master of the game likewise Archer about the british politics the board rooms the stock exchanges without getting carried away....whereas a Ludlum or Crichton or Clancy will go all out which is OK for theirfans but not all</p>
<p>I think the tamil writers know their audience and pitched it at their level...Sujatha is? agood example even his science fiction could reach across the board like en iniya iyandra nad Gino....</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>This is Jean-Luc, a name i copied from the captain USS Enterprise, inStar Trek. The new name is not my real one either.:-) I just like fancy nicknames.</p>
<p>Well, brutality is a streak in the human dna and i was wondering if tamil people were exempt from it. That's all. Because behind the veil of the empires, Roman, british or greek, there were many incidents that make us wonder if humans could have done this. Thankfully popular struggle has brought us democracy. It's ironic that West brought us the concept, not the great indian civilisations. Even though Kudavolai system did exist.</p>
<p>And about that batman quote. Who are heores? The guys who defy the norms ofthe society if it compels them to do wrong. In that respect, very few guysqualify as heroes. In the batman movie, he's talking about Julius Caesar, who was a rabble-rousing, imperialistic<br />manipulative politician. He's a very skilled general, and administrator isall i can say. If you want an ideal example of a hero read To Kill a Mocking Bird or watch that movie.</p>
<p>About the Sri Lankan situation, we are just like the palestinians, not Jewsas some say. The Israelis are the most united people in the world, which we are not. Israelis are able to crush them frequently because Palestinians present no united front. The muslim neighbours betrayed them in the 1946-47war and in the 1967 war. The present developments and the support for palestinians is mainly due to activists in America. Noam Chomsky, the James Falk and others. They made the most heard noise, and the muslim countries, mainly turkey made some token protests. Yaasir Arafat soldiered alone. If onlyhe had some support. And Hamas uses child soldiers. No amount of pressure should force people to do that. And there are definite allegations that LTTE uses child soldiers. Tamil<br />magazines do not confirm or deny this. English magazines scream about this..</p>
<p>Same with our people. We simply do not protect our own. We are more worriedabout 'strategic viability' 'sovereignty' and so on. And how can we ask Manmohan Singh to be 'strong' in condemning? He's one of the few people with a conscience. He cannot be strong when he is reminded of the caste problemsin his own country. And we go to Austria and create caste problems there. For god's sake, we are guests in a foreign country. No wonder we are targets of racism in Australia, Canada or wherever. We must appear so vulnerable to the extremist right wingers. </p>

<p>Jean (now if you are a guy you better say what is your name :))</p>
<p>First of all 'war crimes' is a purely 20th century word, coined for mass genocide when there is an accepted/prevalent code of ethics in the world - most countries are expected to be governed in one way or the other by people,killing another fellow human is a crime, and each country has soverign governing rights over itself. I mean in theory atleast these ethics are accepted as world norm in today's world.</p>
<p>In those days there was no world norms. Monarchies were laws unto themselves, they had to defend and control dissidence in their subjects, there were no elections, governance was a matter of inheritance and sheer brute force in many cases. There are definitely incidents that stand out - for example the so called mass execution of Jains under Mahendra varman or even the gross fact of Aditya Karikalan impaling Veerapandiyan' s head on a spear and glorifying his victory.</p>
<p>The only way to understand all this is by accepting the fact that it was a different time in history, different values, norms, ethics, all of that. With all modern ethical norms we have situations like Sri Lanka and northern Africa, why blame history then, isn't it not?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  I think i'm being very naive by asking this question. Why is tamil history never disputed?</p>
<p>  Apart from the semi-mythical kings in the epics and kappiyams, no real tamil king seems to have been subjected to any criticism. For example, Karikal Cholan. We read that he built a great dam, was a great warrior, mighty king etc.,</p>
<p>  Is it possible that this king did no wrong? Was there no concept of war crimes? Or were all tamil kings chivalrous? And what about the administrative fallacies? No totalitarian kings? No social imbalance? No amoral kings? Considering that most tamil poets were well 'rewarded' for singing praises and most of written records were ordered by the kings, how far can we take them to be authentic?? (Please not here that i have no problems with poetic exxagerations. )</p>
<p>  I'm not as well read as other members so i may have missed things. Kalki does tell us about a few things, like pulikesi's rapacity, mahendravarman' s so-called cowardice, the presence of power brokers (paluvettariar, sambuvaraiyar etc.,). </p>
<p>  I'm not arguing here, just asking a question to clear my ignorance.</p>

          Tamil fiction and details        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Walasingham, I have the non detailed book with Nondipillayar, Kalayar kovil ratham and Nandavanathil or aadni...great books those were.. I have seen a kalki story in any non detail, that is interesting..</p>
<p>Forsyth btw was also a forerunner in describing suicide bombers much beforethey came into practical use. I remember the Hindu publishing extracts from his 'Negotiator' parellely with describing the Rajiv Gandhi assasination.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Marketing is destroying scholarship, if what you say about tamil writers writing to the readership is true. Fiction is a wonderful way to introduce 'hard' topics. I'm of the opinion that one should read, for example, Crichton's Jurassic Park' before trying out tackling the technical books in Biotechnology.</p>
<p>  If you are skipping pages in Kalki, you are not really reading the book. While he sometimes messes up (i thought that nagananthi adigal could have been made into a better supervillain. He reduces his 'geth' in the end? although that is just my opinion)? his dialogue is always crisp and his varnai is like a movie reel. He does keep the reader engaged. And on a different line, i read Kalki's 'Mayilai Kalai" in my aunt's old +2 non-detailed book.. She did +2 in 1970's i think. That book contained a lot of interestingstories too, and stories catered to all kinds of tastes. What happened? Why did the education policy change all of sudden? Anybody else seen that book? Some other stories are "Nanthavanithil oru aandi" "Nondi Pillaiyar" "Kalaiyar Kovil Ratham".</p>
<p>  Talking of descriptive novelists in English, Frederick Forsyth takes the cake. He's my favourite. Clancy is a bit partisan. He says America is always right, russia causes all problems etc.,? Forsyth is a devotee of British monarchy and the Army, and sometimes condescends to the mid east. But he has no illusions about the truth. He clearly says America fudged evidence to start the Gulf War I in The Fist of God. In the same book, he accurately predicted what would happen in Iraq if Saddam Hussein was killed. That bookwas written well before the 2003 Iraq invasion. That guy is a real thinker.</p>

<p>  Dear Jean-luc<br />  I stand corrected what I meant was the machavillian man machine of Elizabeth I</p>
<p>  in terms of the war efforts in Tamil fiction Sandilyan probably is the best as he invest a lot of time and effort in those descriptions. ..<br />  The arrangements of the fortifications in Poompuhar...</p>
<p>  The Viyuhams like Sarpaviyuham and Garudaviyuhams in the final war as well as the war machinary of the greeks...in YavanaRani</p>
<p>  Like wise he goes to town about the various ships in KadalPura the Agramanthiram, sarpamandhiram. ...the various female ships their design etc...</p>
<p>  Kalki's way of writing keeps the reader engaged I beg to differ from somemembers writing you skip pages in PS...actually you will more with Sandilyan as he goes on and on on his varnanais...</p>
<p>  We cannot compare the western authors to ours as the readership varies...even as a<br />  avid reader of english fiction I couldnt understand a few bits of crichtons mathematics but could readily follow Robin Cook or Crichtons medicine based books....so the background matters...the average reader's IQ without sounding arrogant is satisfied with Archer and Sheldon....Sheldon does describe Mining in master of the game likewise Archer about the british politicsthe board rooms the stock exchanges without getting carried away.....whereas a Ludlum or Crichton or Clancy will go all out which is OK for their fans but not all</p>
<p>  I think the tamil writers know their audience and pitched it at their level....Sujatha is? agood example even his science fiction could reach across the board like en iniya iyandra nad Gino....</p>

<p>  This is Jean-Luc, a name i copied from the captain USS Enterprise, in Star Trek. The new name is not my real one either.:-) I just like fancy nicknames.</p>
<p>  Well, brutality is a streak in the human dna and i was wondering if tamilpeople were exempt from it. That's all. Because behind the veil of the empires, Roman, british or greek, there were many incidents that make us wonder if humans could have done this. Thankfully popular struggle has brought us democracy. It's ironic that West brought us the concept, not the great indian civilisations. Even though Kudavolai system did exist.</p>
<p>  And about that batman quote. Who are heores? The guys who defy the<br />  norms of the society if it compels them to do wrong. In that respect, very few guys qualify as heroes. In the batman movie, he's talking about Julius Caesar, who was a rabble-rousing, imperialistic<br />  manipulative politician. He's a very skilled general, and administrator is all i can say. If you want an ideal example of a hero read To Kill a Mocking Bird or watch that movie.</p>
<p>  About the Sri Lankan situation, we are just like the palestinians, not Jews as some say. The Israelis are the most united people in the world, whichwe are not. Israelis are able to crush them frequently because Palestinians present no united front. The muslim neighbours betrayed them in the 1946-47 war and in the 1967 war. The present developments and the support for palestinians is mainly due to activists in America. Noam Chomsky, the James Falk and others. They made the most heard noise, and the muslim countries, mainly turkey made some token protests. Yaasir Arafat soldiered alone. If only he had some support. And Hamas uses child soldiers. No amount of pressure should force people to do that. And there are definite allegations that LTTE uses child soldiers. Tamil<br />  magazines do not confirm or deny this. English magazines scream about this..</p>
<p>  Same with our people. We simply do not protect our own. We are more worried about 'strategic viability' 'sovereignty' and so on. And how can we ask Manmohan Singh to be 'strong' in condemning? He's one of the few people with a conscience. He cannot be strong when he is reminded of the caste problems in his own country. And we go to Austria and create caste problems there. For god's sake, we are guests in a foreign country. No wonder we are targets of racism in Australia, Canada or wherever. We must appear so vulnerable to the extremist right wingers. </p>

<p>  First of all 'war crimes' is a purely 20th century word, coined for mass genocide when there is an accepted/prevalent code of ethics in the world - most countries are expected to be governed in one way or the other by people, killing another fellow human is a crime, and each country has soverign governing rights over itself. I mean in theory atleast these ethics are accepted as world norm in today's world.</p>
<p>  In those days there was no world norms. Monarchies were laws unto themselves, they had to defend and control dissidence in their subjects, there were no elections, governance was a matter of inheritance and sheer brute force in many cases. There are definitely incidents that stand out - for example the so called mass execution of Jains under Mahendra varman or even the gross fact of Aditya Karikalan impaling Veerapandiyan' s head on a spear and glorifying his victory.</p>
<p>  The only way to understand all this is by accepting the fact that it was a different time in history, different values, norms, ethics, all of that. With all modern ethical norms we have situations like Sri Lanka and northern Africa, why blame history then, isn't it not?</p>

          Tamil fiction and details        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Marketing is destroying scholarship, if what you say about tamil writers writing to the readership is true. Fiction is a wonderful way to introduce 'hard' topics. I'm of the opinion that one should read, for example, Crichton's Jurassic Park' before trying out tackling the technical books in Biotechnology.</p>
<p>If you are skipping pages in Kalki, you are not really reading the book. While he sometimes messes up (i thought that nagananthi adigal could have been made into a better supervillain. He reduces his 'geth' in the end? although that is just my opinion)? his dialogue is always crisp and his varnai is like a movie reel. He does keep the reader engaged. And on a differentline, i read Kalki's 'Mayilai Kalai" in my aunt's old +2 non-detailed book.. She did +2 in 1970's i think. That book contained a lot of interesting stories too, and stories catered to all kinds of tastes. What happened? Why did the education policy change all of sudden? Anybody else seen that book?Some other stories are "Nanthavanithil oru aandi" "Nondi Pillaiyar" "Kalaiyar Kovil Ratham".</p>
<p>Talking of descriptive novelists in English, Frederick Forsyth takes the cake. He's my favourite. Clancy is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  partisan. He says America is always right, russia causes all problems etc.,? Forsyth is a devotee of British monarchy and the Army, and sometimes condescends to the mid east. But he has no illusions about the truth. He clearly says America fudged evidence to start the Gulf War I in The Fist of God. In the same book, he accurately predicted what would happen in Iraq if Saddam Hussein was killed. That book was written well before the 2003 Iraq invasion. That guy is a real thinker.</p>

<p>Dear Jean-luc<br />I stand corrected what I meant was the machavillian man machine of Elizabeth I</p>
<p>in terms of the war efforts in Tamil fiction Sandilyan probably is the bestas he invest a lot of time and effort in those descriptions. ..<br />The arrangements of the fortifications in Poompuhar...</p>
<p>The Viyuhams like Sarpaviyuham and Garudaviyuhams in the final war as well as the war machinary of the greeks...in YavanaRani</p>
<p>Like wise he goes to town about the various ships in KadalPura the Agramanthiram, sarpamandhiram. ...the various female ships their design etc...</p>
<p>Kalki's way of writing keeps the reader engaged I beg to differ from some members writing you skip pages in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ...actually you will more with Sandilyanas he goes on and on on his varnanais...</p>
<p>We cannot compare the western authors to ours as the readership varies...even as a<br />avid reader of english fiction I couldnt understand a few bits of crichtons mathematics but could readily follow Robin Cook or Crichtons medicine based books....so the background matters...the average reader's IQ without sounding arrogant is satisfied with Archer and Sheldon....Sheldon does describe Mining in master of the game likewise Archer about the british politics the board rooms the stock exchanges without getting carried away.....whereasa Ludlum or Crichton or Clancy will go all out which is OK for their fans but not all</p>
<p>I think the tamil writers know their audience and pitched it at their level....Sujatha is? agood example even his science fiction could reach acrossthe board like en iniya iyandra nad Gino....</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>This is Jean-Luc, a name i copied from the captain USS Enterprise, inStar Trek. The new name is not my real one either.:-) I just like fancy nicknames.</p>
<p>Well, brutality is a streak in the human dna and i was wondering if tamil people were exempt from it. That's all. Because behind the veil of the empires, Roman, british or greek, there were many incidents that make us wonder if humans could have done this. Thankfully popular struggle has brought us democracy. It's ironic that West brought us the concept, not the great indian civilisations. Even though Kudavolai system did exist.</p>
<p>And about that batman quote. Who are heores? The guys who defy the<br />norms of the society if it compels them to do wrong. In that respect, veryfew guys qualify as heroes. In the batman movie, he's talking about JuliusCaesar, who was a rabble-rousing, imperialistic<br />manipulative politician. He's a very skilled general, and administrator isall i can say. If you want an ideal example of a hero read To Kill a Mocking Bird or watch that movie.</p>
<p>About the Sri Lankan situation, we are just like the palestinians, not Jewsas some say. The Israelis are the most united people in the world, which we are not. Israelis are able to crush them frequently because Palestinians present no united front. The muslim neighbours betrayed them in the 1946-47war and in the 1967 war. The present developments and the support for palestinians is mainly due to activists in America. Noam Chomsky, the James Falk and others. They made the most heard noise, and the muslim countries, mainly turkey made some token protests. Yaasir Arafat soldiered alone. If onlyhe had some support. And Hamas uses child soldiers. No amount of pressure should force people to do that. And there are definite allegations that LTTE uses child soldiers. Tamil<br />magazines do not confirm or deny this. English magazines scream about this..</p>
<p>Same with our people. We simply do not protect our own. We are more worriedabout 'strategic viability' 'sovereignty' and so on. And how can we ask Manmohan Singh to be 'strong' in condemning? He's one of the few people with a conscience. He cannot be strong when he is reminded of the caste problemsin his own country. And we go to Austria and create caste problems there. For god's sake, we are guests in a foreign country. No wonder we are targets of racism in Australia, Canada or wherever. We must appear so vulnerable to the extremist right wingers. </p>

<p>Jean (now if you are a guy you better say what is your name :))</p>
<p>First of all 'war crimes' is a purely 20th century word, coined for mass genocide when there is an accepted/prevalent code of ethics in the world - most countries are expected to be governed in one way or the other by people,killing another fellow human is a crime, and each country has soverign governing rights over itself. I mean in theory atleast these ethics are accepted as world norm in today's world.</p>
<p>In those days there was no world norms. Monarchies were laws unto themselves, they had to defend and control dissidence in their subjects, there were no elections, governance was a matter of inheritance and sheer brute force in many cases. There are definitely incidents that stand out - for example the so called mass execution of Jains under Mahendra varman or even the gross fact of Aditya Karikalan impaling Veerapandiyan' s head on a spear and glorifying his victory.</p>
<p>The only way to understand all this is by accepting the fact that it was a different time in history, different values, norms, ethics, all of that. With all modern ethical norms we have situations like Sri Lanka and northern Africa, why blame history then, isn't it not?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  I think i'm being very naive by asking this question. Why is tamil history never disputed?</p>
<p>  Apart from the semi-mythical kings in the epics and kappiyams, no real tamil king seems to have been subjected to any criticism. For example, Karikal Cholan. We read that he built a great dam, was a great warrior, mighty king etc.,</p>
<p>  Is it possible that this king did no wrong? Was there no concept of war crimes? Or were all tamil kings chivalrous? And what about the administrative fallacies? No totalitarian kings? No social imbalance? No amoral kings? Considering that most tamil poets were well 'rewarded' for singing praises and most of written records were ordered by the kings, how far can we take them to be authentic?? (Please not here that i have no problems with poetic exxagerations. )</p>
<p>  I'm not as well read as other members so i may have missed things. Kalki does tell us about a few things, like pulikesi's rapacity, mahendravarman' s so-called cowardice, the presence of power brokers (paluvettariar, sambuvaraiyar etc.,). </p>
<p>  I'm not arguing here, just asking a question to clear my ignorance.</p>
