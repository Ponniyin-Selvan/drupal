<p>That is DENSE Translation - with deep inner meaning !</p>
<p>Excellent.. Not sure whether Thiruppugazh is already translated to <br />English.. You seem to be having the potency to accomplish such <br />tasks !!</p>
<p>To begin with write highpoints on Arunagirinathar .. Thiruppugazh <br />and Arunagiri's other works - a synopsis on Thirumuruga Krupananda <br />Vaariyar !! </p>

<p>Very best wishes,</p>

<blockquote><p>  There are many translations for this specific one stanza of <br />Anubuthi.<br />  Anubuthi is a brilliant work and my personal favourite. Each hymn, <br />is <br />  very thoughtful, intense and deep. </p>
<p>  Here is what I believe in, it is long, I hope to keep it a bit <br />crisp <br />  and interesting with Why and How included:</p>
<p>  Uruvai Aruvai ulathai ilathai, <br />  The form that you have taken from being a formless (ONE) entity, <br />you <br />  are being that of existant and that is nonexistant.</p>
<p>  Maruvai malarai,<br />  The material of flower and its life of fragrance, the beauty of <br />jewel <br />  and its potrayal by light.<br />  A flower without fragrance is not to be on value, hence the lord <br />  gives the flower and its fragrance, Skanda does the purpose and <br />the <br />  sense of purpose.</p>
<p>  maniyai oliyai<br />  Same with the jewel, when a gem is in a dark room, it is not going <br />to <br />  be of value, that light that makes the stone to a jewel is what <br />  skanda offers, our Guha has the Self embodied into it, He is the <br />  light of Guru, which brings the Self out of its Guha as Guru Guha.<br />  (read - subramanya bujangam - Guha is explained below).</p>
<p>  Karuvai Uyirai<br />  The Body and the Self, you are the Self and its Shell and the five <br />  layers connecting between them. Karu is body as in Siva and Uyir <br />is <br />  Self as in Shakti as per one one thought.</p>
<p>  Gathiyai vithiyai<br />  The solace who is my destiny to remove my bondage of life and <br />death.</p>
<p>  Guruvai varuvai arulvai Guhane.<br />  You are my master, The Lord here as prescribed is to be taken in <br />  words from above prior to bottling him up as a master who does <br />  upadesam. The Guru is everything, any one you learn from becomes a <br />  Guru - for that instant, the God's representative, hence is <br />greater <br />  than God himself for the presentation layer is everythin. Hence <br />you <br />  learn from the day you are born, mother is a Guru, Father is, your <br />  educator is, God is... so Guru is you, My Lord.<br />  Let me know the bliss, Guhane - that word Guhane is extremely apt <br />in <br />  here. It shows the relation from the words as above, where Guru <br />  Arunagiri points one to the Self inside the Guha, our Self that <br />sits <br />  beyond Body - Breath - Mind - Memory - Intellect - Ego - The SELF.<br />  The first 6 parts constitute the dark cave or Guhai and the one <br />who <br />  is eternal and lives inside that waiting for the call is the form <br />of <br />  all prevading light called as Guhan.</p>

<p>    Original Tamil poem in my blog<br />    <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/kandaranuputi51/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/kandaranuputi51/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/kandaranuputi51/</a></p>
<p>    You who have form and who are formless,<br />    you who are both being and non being,<br />    who are the fragrance and the blossom,<br />    who are the jewel and its lusture,<br />    who are the seed of life and life itself,<br />    who are mode and act of existence,<br />    who are supreme guru,come<br />    bestow your grace,o Guha.<br />    Translated by Kamil V Zvelebil</p>
<p>    Formed,Formless;     Being,Non being;     Flower,Fragrance;     Jewel,Radiance;     Embryo,Life;     Goal and Way;     Come,Guha,Guru;     Grant your Grace.<br />    Translated by Fred W Clothey</p>
<p>    The one who appears as Formed,as formless;as a Being,as a Non-<br />Being;     as Fragrance,as a Flower;as a Jewel, as its Radiance;     as an Embryo,as a Life; as a way<br />    and as destiny;As a Guru come here; Grant your Grace to me Guha.<br />    My own translation (very close to the structure of the Original <br />  Tamil<br />    poem,slightly modified Clothey's Translation to match the <br />structure<br />    of the original Tamil poem)</p>
<p>    Unless and until you know Tamil and you can read this poem in <br />  Tamil, you<br />    can never completely enjoy this poem. The English translations <br />can <br />  just<br />    give you the pleasure of Philosophy but the musical quality of <br />the <br />  Tamil<br />    original can never be reproduce by the translation. Kamil <br />Zvelebil <br />  in a<br />    comment to this poem says" I suggest this stanza is no<br />    "word-jugglery" but perfection itself - as far as philosophic<br />    poetry goes - both in thought content and form: whole philosophy <br />is<br />    expressed in three lines of poetry which sounds like music.This <br />is<br />    Arunakiri's real greatness. He has reached extreme limits in his<br />    masterly use of phonasthetic qualities of Tamil, and such <br />stanzas <br />  are<br />    therefore untranslatable."<br />    Clothey on this poem "Nearly perfect symmetry of alliteration and<br />    meter combine with contrasting and complimentary verbal images <br />to <br />  evoke<br />    full scope of human emotion and thought in praise of God Murukan.</p>
<p>    If you closely observe the poem you will see that it is carefully<br />    patterned with negative and positive pairs and pairs of action <br />and<br />    result.</p>
<p>    No wonder Arunagiri is considered Magician of Words.</p></vairam@></p></blockquote>

        <p>Thanks Ravi. Is it possible to get Sri Varriyaar's translations on the web? Or any books u can suggest?<br />&nbsp; Yes Guruji Raghavan is almost synonymous with Thirupugazh for Delhiites &amp; now for Chennaites too.<br />Shobha</p>

<p>Kaumaram is a great site to download all songs,Sri Gopala sundaram <br />has done some extensive translations. Mostly literal and in word to <br />word translations. Thiru Vaariyar has some wonderful translations, <br />for the literacy wants - and soul.</p>
<p>Guruji AS Ragavan has done a great work by composing tunes for many <br />songs. That has lit up the lives of many.</p>

          Arunagiri ?The Magician of words? - Praising Lord Muruga        </div>

        <p>Thank you Ravi and Venkat.</p>
<p>very interesting exchanges.</p>
<p>regards/ sps</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi SPS</p>
<p>  Thirupugazh is translated by many, Indians and westerners also. <br />Each <br />  one gets his own interpretation.<br />  Pure literature wise, it is rich but the translation alone makes <br />not <br />  much sense.</p>
<p>  However, if you read it with various views in place, it is <br />possibly <br />  the best known poem collection of over 1300 songs in tamil (16000 <br />in <br />  actual only 1322 have been recovered). If we translate Guru <br />  Arunagiri's works as just simple tamil translation, it will be <br />likely <br />  to land up as erotic literature in most cases.</p>
<p>  Thiru Muruga Vaariyar had translated a lot of these songs, I am <br />  gifted to be blessed with some of those books. I can try and post <br />a <br />  few of that along with other translations. I will thank the Lord <br />for <br />  using me.</p>
<p>  Thirupugazh is also a form of The Githa in tamil, if I may say. <br />The <br />  prime difference being thirupugazh talks of all paths to God and <br />does <br />  not conclude on who is the One. Guru Arunagiri, lets us take these <br />  songs and move us to invoke our own creativity and travel inside.</p>
<p>  For ex, his first thirupugazh song: <br />  Muthai tharu pathith thirunagai<br />  athikkirai satthi saravana<br />  muthikkoru vithukkurupara....</p>
<p>  English literal translation:<br />  You are the Consort of Devayaanai* with a beautiful smile and <br />lovely <br />  teeth looking like pearls! <br />  You are SaravaNabhava holding the powerful spear called SakthivEl!<br />  You are the foremost seed for the Heaven"</p>
<p>  He starts of saying 'Oh Consort of Devayani, who has smile as <br />clear <br />  as a string of pearls'<br />  Invoking Devayani - the power of creativity, kriya shakti. He <br />calls <br />  her to help the 'sol' or 'vaaku' or 'pulamai' hence addresses the <br />  smile of the lord as string of pearls, now if you read deeper and <br />  repuzzle his words, you can see that he wants Mother Devayani to <br />  guide the Lord to talk through him.<br />  Perumal kitte varam ketta kidaikathu, thayar siru kan jadai <br />kidaithal <br />  mukthiye kidaikum nu soluvanga, same story here.<br />  Now the next two lines, Sathi saravana - the shakti vel (use of <br />the <br />  term shaktivel - potent energy) that raises from the kundalini <br />sows <br />  the seed that leads one to mukthi by the words of the upadesam of <br />the <br />  Almighty Guru himself.<br />  The words are so carefully pinned into each other that they can be <br />  easily dismissed without any notice when we read them as <br />literature.</p>
<p>  in 4 lines, Guru Arunagiri has so much meaning, it is a whole <br />library <br />  to decode his works.</p>
<p>  But then, it has to start somewhere.</p>

<p>    - Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>    That is DENSE Translation - with deep inner meaning !</p>
<p>    Excellent.. Not sure whether Thiruppugazh is already translated <br />to <br />    English.. You seem to be having the potency to accomplish such <br />    tasks !!</p>
<p>    To begin with write highpoints on Arunagirinathar .. <br />Thiruppugazh <br />    and Arunagiri's other works - a synopsis on Thirumuruga <br />Krupananda <br />    Vaariyar !! </p>

<p>      There are many translations for this specific one stanza of <br />    Anubuthi.<br />      Anubuthi is a brilliant work and my personal favourite. Each <br />  hymn, <br />    is <br />      very thoughtful, intense and deep. </p>
<p>      Here is what I believe in, it is long, I hope to keep it a bit <br />    crisp <br />      and interesting with Why and How included:</p>
<p>      Uruvai Aruvai ulathai ilathai, <br />      The form that you have taken from being a formless (ONE) <br />entity, <br />    you <br />      are being that of existant and that is nonexistant.</p>
<p>      Maruvai malarai,<br />      The material of flower and its life of fragrance, the beauty <br />of <br />    jewel <br />      and its potrayal by light.<br />      A flower without fragrance is not to be on value, hence the <br />lord <br />      gives the flower and its fragrance, Skanda does the purpose <br />and <br />    the <br />      sense of purpose.</p>
<p>      maniyai oliyai<br />      Same with the jewel, when a gem is in a dark room, it is not <br />  going <br />    to <br />      be of value, that light that makes the stone to a jewel is <br />what <br />      skanda offers, our Guha has the Self embodied into it, He is <br />the <br />      light of Guru, which brings the Self out of its Guha as Guru <br />Guha.<br />      (read - subramanya bujangam - Guha is explained below).</p>
<p>      Karuvai Uyirai<br />      The Body and the Self, you are the Self and its Shell and the <br />  five <br />      layers connecting between them. Karu is body as in Siva and <br />Uyir <br />    is <br />      Self as in Shakti as per one one thought.</p>
<p>      Gathiyai vithiyai<br />      The solace who is my destiny to remove my bondage of life and <br />    death.</p>
<p>      Guruvai varuvai arulvai Guhane.<br />      You are my master, The Lord here as prescribed is to be taken <br />in <br />      words from above prior to bottling him up as a master who does <br />      upadesam. The Guru is everything, any one you learn from <br />becomes <br />  a <br />      Guru - for that instant, the God's representative, hence is <br />    greater <br />      than God himself for the presentation layer is everythin. <br />Hence <br />    you <br />      learn from the day you are born, mother is a Guru, Father is, <br />  your <br />      educator is, God is... so Guru is you, My Lord.<br />      Let me know the bliss, Guhane - that word Guhane is extremely <br />apt <br />    in <br />      here. It shows the relation from the words as above, where <br />Guru <br />      Arunagiri points one to the Self inside the Guha, our Self <br />that <br />    sits <br />      beyond Body - Breath - Mind - Memory - Intellect - Ego - The <br />SELF.<br />      The first 6 parts constitute the dark cave or Guhai and the <br />one <br />    who <br />      is eternal and lives inside that waiting for the call is the <br />form <br />    of <br />      all prevading light called as Guhan.</p>

<p>        Original Tamil poem in my blog<br />        <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/kandaranuputi51/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/kandaranuputi51/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/kandaranuputi51/</a></p>
<p>        You who have form and who are formless,<br />        you who are both being and non being,<br />        who are the fragrance and the blossom,<br />        who are the jewel and its lusture,<br />        who are the seed of life and life itself,<br />        who are mode and act of existence,<br />        who are supreme guru,come<br />        bestow your grace,o Guha.<br />        Translated by Kamil V Zvelebil</p>
<p>        Formed,Formless;         Being,Non being;         Flower,Fragrance;         Jewel,Radiance;         Embryo,Life;         Goal and Way;         Come,Guha,Guru;         Grant your Grace.<br />        Translated by Fred W Clothey</p>
<p>        The one who appears as Formed,as formless;as a Being,as a <br />Non-<br />    Being;         as Fragrance,as a Flower;as a Jewel, as its Radiance;         as an Embryo,as a Life; as a way<br />        and as destiny;As a Guru come here; Grant your Grace to me <br />Guha.<br />        My own translation (very close to the structure of the <br />Original <br />      Tamil<br />        poem,slightly modified Clothey's Translation to match the <br />    structure<br />        of the original Tamil poem)</p>
<p>        Unless and until you know Tamil and you can read this poem <br />in <br />      Tamil, you<br />        can never completely enjoy this poem. The English <br />translations <br />    can <br />      just<br />        give you the pleasure of Philosophy but the musical quality <br />of <br />    the <br />      Tamil<br />        original can never be reproduce by the translation. Kamil <br />    Zvelebil <br />      in a<br />        comment to this poem says" I suggest this stanza is no<br />        "word-jugglery" but perfection itself - as far as philosophic<br />        poetry goes - both in thought content and form: whole <br />  philosophy <br />    is<br />        expressed in three lines of poetry which sounds like <br />music.This <br />    is<br />        Arunakiri's real greatness. He has reached extreme limits in <br />his<br />        masterly use of phonasthetic qualities of Tamil, and such <br />    stanzas <br />      are<br />        therefore untranslatable."<br />        Clothey on this poem "Nearly perfect symmetry of <br />alliteration <br />  and<br />        meter combine with contrasting and complimentary verbal <br />images <br />    to <br />      evoke<br />        full scope of human emotion and thought in praise of God <br />  Murukan.</p>
<p>        If you closely observe the poem you will see that it is <br />  carefully<br />        patterned with negative and positive pairs and pairs of <br />action <br />    and<br />        result.</p>
<p>        No wonder Arunagiri is considered Magician of Words.</p></ravi_eds@></p></sps10142004@></p></blockquote>

          Arunagiri ?The Magician of words? - Praising Lord Muruga        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi SPS</p>
<p>Thirupugazh is translated by many, Indians and westerners also. Each <br />one gets his own interpretation.<br />Pure literature wise, it is rich but the translation alone makes not <br />much sense.</p>
<p>However, if you read it with various views in place, it is possibly <br />the best known poem collection of over 1300 songs in tamil (16000 in <br />actual only 1322 have been recovered). If we translate Guru <br />Arunagiri's works as just simple tamil translation, it will be likely <br />to land up as erotic literature in most cases.</p>
<p>Thiru Muruga Vaariyar had translated a lot of these songs, I am <br />gifted to be blessed with some of those books. I can try and post a <br />few of that along with other translations. I will thank the Lord for <br />using me.</p>
<p>Thirupugazh is also a form of The Githa in tamil, if I may say. The <br />prime difference being thirupugazh talks of all paths to God and does <br />not conclude on who is the One. Guru Arunagiri, lets us take these <br />songs and move us to invoke our own creativity and travel inside.</p>
<p>For ex, his first thirupugazh song: <br />Muthai tharu pathith thirunagai<br />athikkirai satthi saravana<br />muthikkoru vithukkurupara....</p>
<p>English literal translation:<br />You are the Consort of Devayaanai* with a beautiful smile and lovely <br />teeth looking like pearls! <br />You are SaravaNabhava holding the powerful spear called SakthivEl!<br />You are the foremost seed for the Heaven"</p>
<p>He starts of saying 'Oh Consort of Devayani, who has smile as clear <br />as a string of pearls'<br />Invoking Devayani - the power of creativity, kriya shakti. He calls <br />her to help the 'sol' or 'vaaku' or 'pulamai' hence addresses the <br />smile of the lord as string of pearls, now if you read deeper and <br />repuzzle his words, you can see that he wants Mother Devayani to <br />guide the Lord to talk through him.<br />Perumal kitte varam ketta kidaikathu, thayar siru <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  jadai kidaithal <br />mukthiye kidaikum nu soluvanga, same story here.<br />Now the next two lines, Sathi saravana - the shakti vel (use of the <br />term shaktivel - potent energy) that raises from the kundalini sows <br />the seed that leads one to mukthi by the words of the upadesam of the <br />Almighty Guru himself.<br />The words are so carefully pinned into each other that they can be <br />easily dismissed without any notice when we read them as literature.</acronym></p>
<p>in 4 lines, Guru Arunagiri has so much meaning, it is a whole library <br />to decode his works.</p>
<p>But then, it has to start somewhere.</p>

<p>    There are many translations for this specific one stanza of <br />  Anubuthi.<br />    Anubuthi is a brilliant work and my personal favourite. Each <br />hymn, <br />  is <br />    very thoughtful, intense and deep. </p>
<p>    Here is what I believe in, it is long, I hope to keep it a bit <br />  crisp <br />    and interesting with Why and How included:</p>
<p>    Uruvai Aruvai ulathai ilathai, <br />    The form that you have taken from being a formless (ONE) entity, <br />  you <br />    are being that of existant and that is nonexistant.</p>
<p>    Maruvai malarai,<br />    The material of flower and its life of fragrance, the beauty of <br />  jewel <br />    and its potrayal by light.<br />    A flower without fragrance is not to be on value, hence the lord <br />    gives the flower and its fragrance, Skanda does the purpose and <br />  the <br />    sense of purpose.</p>
<p>    maniyai oliyai<br />    Same with the jewel, when a gem is in a dark room, it is not <br />going <br />  to <br />    be of value, that light that makes the stone to a jewel is what <br />    skanda offers, our Guha has the Self embodied into it, He is the <br />    light of Guru, which brings the Self out of its Guha as Guru Guha.<br />    (read - subramanya bujangam - Guha is explained below).</p>
<p>    Karuvai Uyirai<br />    The Body and the Self, you are the Self and its Shell and the <br />five <br />    layers connecting between them. Karu is body as in Siva and Uyir <br />  is <br />    Self as in Shakti as per one one thought.</p>
<p>    Gathiyai vithiyai<br />    The solace who is my destiny to remove my bondage of life and <br />  death.</p>
<p>    Guruvai varuvai arulvai Guhane.<br />    You are my master, The Lord here as prescribed is to be taken in <br />    words from above prior to bottling him up as a master who does <br />    upadesam. The Guru is everything, any one you learn from becomes <br />a <br />    Guru - for that instant, the God's representative, hence is <br />  greater <br />    than God himself for the presentation layer is everythin. Hence <br />  you <br />    learn from the day you are born, mother is a Guru, Father is, <br />your <br />    educator is, God is... so Guru is you, My Lord.<br />    Let me know the bliss, Guhane - that word Guhane is extremely apt <br />  in <br />    here. It shows the relation from the words as above, where Guru <br />    Arunagiri points one to the Self inside the Guha, our Self that <br />  sits <br />    beyond Body - Breath - Mind - Memory - Intellect - Ego - The SELF.<br />    The first 6 parts constitute the dark cave or Guhai and the one <br />  who <br />    is eternal and lives inside that waiting for the call is the form <br />  of <br />    all prevading light called as Guhan.</p>

<p>      The one who appears as Formed,as formless;as a Being,as a Non-<br />  Being;       as Fragrance,as a Flower;as a Jewel, as its Radiance;       as an Embryo,as a Life; as a way<br />      and as destiny;As a Guru come here; Grant your Grace to me Guha.<br />      My own translation (very close to the structure of the Original <br />    Tamil<br />      poem,slightly modified Clothey's Translation to match the <br />  structure<br />      of the original Tamil poem)</p>
<p>      Unless and until you know Tamil and you can read this poem in <br />    Tamil, you<br />      can never completely enjoy this poem. The English translations <br />  can <br />    just<br />      give you the pleasure of Philosophy but the musical quality of <br />  the <br />    Tamil<br />      original can never be reproduce by the translation. Kamil <br />  Zvelebil <br />    in a<br />      comment to this poem says" I suggest this stanza is no<br />      "word-jugglery" but perfection itself - as far as philosophic<br />      poetry goes - both in thought content and form: whole <br />philosophy <br />  is<br />      expressed in three lines of poetry which sounds like music.This <br />  is<br />      Arunakiri's real greatness. He has reached extreme limits in his<br />      masterly use of phonasthetic qualities of Tamil, and such <br />  stanzas <br />    are<br />      therefore untranslatable."<br />      Clothey on this poem "Nearly perfect symmetry of alliteration <br />and<br />      meter combine with contrasting and complimentary verbal images <br />  to <br />    evoke<br />      full scope of human emotion and thought in praise of God <br />Murukan.</p>
<p>      If you closely observe the poem you will see that it is <br />carefully<br />      patterned with negative and positive pairs and pairs of action <br />  and<br />      result.</p>
<p>      No wonder Arunagiri is considered Magician of Words.</p>

          Arunagiri ?The Magician of words? - Praising Lord Muruga        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Arunagiri did not write the verses, it is very evident from his own <br />works, i can write some beautiful verses of his works to validate my <br />point, Arunagiri was dead the moment he jumped off the temple, who <br />was the Guru Arunagiri is the other question.</p>
<p>Also: I have been searching for the Devanur temple... if you can tell <br />where it is , i will be very thankful.</p>
<p>the song you have mentioned is:</p>
<p>Tarakasuran sarinthu vizha verudan parinthu ...</p>
<p>This is a special song as Guru Arunagiri, according to one <br />translation, treats him as his friend, the type of Arjuna, he says<br />'aasai kooru nanba endru maa mayur kantha endu aaval theea ndru <br />nindru pugazhveno '. </p>

<p>      There are many translations for this specific one stanza of <br />    Anubuthi.<br />      Anubuthi is a brilliant work and my personal favourite. Each <br />  hymn, <br />    is <br />      very thoughtful, intense and deep. </p>
<p>      Here is what I believe in, it is long, I hope to keep it a bit <br />    crisp <br />      and interesting with Why and How included:</p>
<p>      Uruvai Aruvai ulathai ilathai, <br />      The form that you have taken from being a formless (ONE) <br />entity, <br />    you <br />      are being that of existant and that is nonexistant.</p>
<p>      Maruvai malarai,<br />      The material of flower and its life of fragrance, the beauty of <br />    jewel <br />      and its potrayal by light.<br />      A flower without fragrance is not to be on value, hence the <br />lord <br />      gives the flower and its fragrance, Skanda does the purpose and <br />    the <br />      sense of purpose.</p>
<p>      maniyai oliyai<br />      Same with the jewel, when a gem is in a dark room, it is not <br />  going <br />    to <br />      be of value, that light that makes the stone to a jewel is what <br />      skanda offers, our Guha has the Self embodied into it, He is <br />the <br />      light of Guru, which brings the Self out of its Guha as Guru <br />Guha.<br />      (read - subramanya bujangam - Guha is explained below).</p>
<p>      Karuvai Uyirai<br />      The Body and the Self, you are the Self and its Shell and the <br />  five <br />      layers connecting between them. Karu is body as in Siva and <br />Uyir <br />    is <br />      Self as in Shakti as per one one thought.</p>
<p>      Gathiyai vithiyai<br />      The solace who is my destiny to remove my bondage of life and <br />    death.</p>
<p>      Guruvai varuvai arulvai Guhane.<br />      You are my master, The Lord here as prescribed is to be taken <br />in <br />      words from above prior to bottling him up as a master who does <br />      upadesam. The Guru is everything, any one you learn from <br />becomes <br />  a <br />      Guru - for that instant, the God's representative, hence is <br />    greater <br />      than God himself for the presentation layer is everythin. Hence <br />    you <br />      learn from the day you are born, mother is a Guru, Father is, <br />  your <br />      educator is, God is... so Guru is you, My Lord.<br />      Let me know the bliss, Guhane - that word Guhane is extremely <br />apt <br />    in <br />      here. It shows the relation from the words as above, where Guru <br />      Arunagiri points one to the Self inside the Guha, our Self that <br />    sits <br />      beyond Body - Breath - Mind - Memory - Intellect - Ego - The <br />SELF.<br />      The first 6 parts constitute the dark cave or Guhai and the one <br />    who <br />      is eternal and lives inside that waiting for the call is the <br />form <br />    of <br />      all prevading light called as Guhan.</p>
