<p>I was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'. This book <br />takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of Kanaiyazhi (1964-<br />74) and the selection is by Asokamitran. <br />There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan's style <br />of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon. Apparently <br />this is his only story. The story is two episodes (Episode 300 and <br />301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a piece of <br />the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the <br />episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking about the <br />literary criticisms levelled at <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . <br />Although when I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  in eighth standard I was enamoured by the <br />romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my college <br />days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely). <br />For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and reading it <br />doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are those of us <br />who got interested in their history but I think the percentage is <br />much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point in <br />looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont read, <br />say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to do that I <br />will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  for the <br />sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the soul, I <br />will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'. <br />One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of <br />thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the mocking words <br />by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the novel 'Sivagami <br />ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing remark <br />criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the escapism in <br />life.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>The point here is not to throw mud on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . You can simply call this <br />between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I chose to call <br />it <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  because this a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group. My question is this</p>
<p>What, if any, is the literary value of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym /SS?</p>

        <p>Do you know anyone that has the list of such<br />collectors ?</p>
<p>We can hire students to follow up and persuade the<br />collectors to grant permission to make a scan of the<br />palm leaft text.</p>
<p>--- "Vijay Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@yahoo.com.sg  wrote:</p></vj_episteme@yahoo.com.sg></p>
<blockquote><p>  The most important works in this are - collection of<br />  the material, <br />  preserving them as such and archieving via some<br />  medium, translating <br />  them and converting them to current text. The task<br />  is enormous and a <br />  lot of people /univ/institutions have tried/are<br />  trying this, they <br />  have the infrastructure to do the tasks exceptfor<br />  the first. this is <br />  where groups like us can contribute.</p>
<p>  to collect /spread awareness - as of now the bulk<br />  of the palm leaf <br />  scripts are stuck in govt archives ( inside india),<br />  art collectors <br />  and museums ( in europe), private collections ( both<br />  in india and <br />  abroad)- <br />  the problems is that some of the collectors do not<br />  know what they <br />  are holding. meaning they know that its an old<br />  manuscript, but do <br />  not have any way of knowing what they hold</p>
<p>  WE CAN COME UP WITH A SAMPLE OF THE WRITINGS - PALM<br />  LEAF, STONE <br />  INSCRIPTIONS - TO SHOW THE VARIOUS SCRIPTS - LIKE<br />  WHAT VARALAARU HAS <br />  (7th C pallava script etc), / PUT IT INTO A PDF FILE<br />  AND HOST IT ON <br />  THE NET. WITH A REQUEST TO ANYONE WHO HAS SIMILAR<br />  SCRIPT TO CTC or <br />  to asssist in atleast co ordinating in obtaining a<br />  copy.</p>
<p>  We also need to tie up with a institute/organisation<br />  who can then <br />  take over the rest of the work. Publishing them is<br />  the last task and <br />  am sure once the other tasks are done, getting these<br />  works of great <br />  literary value to be published cab ne easily<br />  acomplished.</p>
<p>  rgds<br />  vj</p>
<p>    With Vijay also sharing this interest, we can form<br />  a core-<br />  committee <br />    and explore more possibilities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iias.nl/?q=node/9" title="http://www.iias.nl/?q=node/9">http://www.iias.nl/?q=node/9</a></p>
<p>Workshop organized by IIAS. Convenor: Saraju Rath </p>
<p>Our access to ancient Indian texts, many of which have a history of <br />more than a millennium, is based on manuscripts whose lifespan is <br />efforts have been made to collect, store and preserve the <br />manuscripts in libraries inside and outside India[1]. In the second <br />half of the 18th century, a few British officers such as Sir William <br />Jones (1746-1794), Sir Robert Chambers (1774-1779), Colin Mackenzie <br />(1782 - 1806) took a deep interest in Indian culture. They tried to <br />get acquainted with the Sanskrit language and literature, and <br />started collecting inscriptions, epigraphs, and manuscripts <br />privately. An institution named as "The Asiatic Society of Bengal" <br />was established in 1781 with as one of its aims the collection and <br />preservation of valuable manuscripts, a huge number of which was <br />lying in the houses of scholars, in schools and p??ha??l?s, in <br />religious ma?hs, monasteries, chaityas, temples, palace and village <br />libraries in Bengal and different parts of India. Later on, in the <br />latter half of the 19th century, the then Government of India took <br />an active part and allocated funds for the collection of <br />manuscripts. Scholars such as G. B?hler, A.C. Burnell, R.G. <br />Bhandarkar, R.L. Mitra, F. Kielhorn, G. Oppert, G.B. Malleson and <br />few others were deputed to tour in different provinces of India in <br />search of manuscripts, to make a list of the available ones and to <br />purchase the more important of them. Since then the mission of the <br />collection, preservation, and cataloguing of manuscripts, and the <br />preparation of critical editions of important texts conserved in <br />them, is going on in and outside India by scholars world wide with <br />an interest to protect and study this rich cultural heritage. </p>
<p>To get a better understanding of the ancient texts these manuscripts <br />contain, it is important to know the history and pedigree of the <br />manuscripts and of the collections to which they belong. In South <br />India, manuscripts were till relatively recently produced and <br />preserved according to ancient procedures and on traditional <br />materials, namely palm leaf. Moreover, in South India a large number <br />of regional scripts have remained in use for writing Sanskrit texts. <br />A detailed knowledge of these scripts and their mutual stylistic <br />influence is of primary importance for the attribution of a date and <br />place of origin to the manuscripts. </p>
<p>The aim of the seminar is to study the production, distribution and <br />collection of Sanskrit manuscripts in ancient South India in order <br />to get a better picture of the history of currently available <br />manuscripts such as those in the enormous collections of the <br />Sarasvati Mahal library in Tanjavur (containing the collections of <br />Maharaj Serfoji, Jambhun?th Bha??a, Kagalkar and Patanga Avadhuta <br />families of Tanjore and many others[2]), of the Adyar Library and <br />the Government Oriental Manuscripts library in Chennai (containing <br />the vast collections of Colonel Mackenzie[3], Dr. Leyden and Mr. C. <br />P. Brown), but also those in collections outside India, for <br />instance, the Van Manen collection of palm leaf manuscripts of the <br />Kern Institute, Leiden. </p>

        <p>The most important works in this are - collection of the material, <br />preserving them as such and archieving via some medium, translating <br />them and converting them to current text. The task is enormous and a <br />lot of people /univ/institutions have tried/are trying this, they <br />have the infrastructure to do the tasks exceptfor the first. this is <br />where groups like us can contribute.</p>
<p>to collect /spread awareness - as of now the bulk of the palm leaf <br />scripts are stuck in govt archives ( inside india), art collectors <br />and museums ( in europe), private collections ( both in india and <br />abroad)- <br />the problems is that some of the collectors do not know what they <br />are holding. meaning they know that its an old manuscript, but do <br />not have any way of knowing what they hold</p>
<p>WE CAN COME UP WITH A SAMPLE OF THE WRITINGS - PALM LEAF, STONE <br />INSCRIPTIONS - TO SHOW THE VARIOUS SCRIPTS - LIKE WHAT VARALAARU HAS <br />(7th C pallava script etc), / PUT IT INTO A PDF FILE AND HOST IT ON <br />THE NET. WITH A REQUEST TO ANYONE WHO HAS SIMILAR SCRIPT TO CTC or <br />to asssist in atleast co ordinating in obtaining a copy.</p>
<p>We also need to tie up with a institute/organisation who can then <br />take over the rest of the work. Publishing them is the last task and <br />am sure once the other tasks are done, getting these works of great <br />literary value to be published cab ne easily acomplished.</p>

<p>    Hi all,</p>
<p>    I am truly amazed by Mr Sandeep's posting. Is it<br />  true that even in <br />  South India the South Indian history is dismissed in<br />  just two pages. </p>
<p>    I thought it's the situation only in north, west<br />  and east of the <br />  country. Why didn't anyone, from the south who is an</p>
<p>  academic/scholar in Indian history, try and correct<br />  this inequality <br />  or even injustice? As far as I am concerned I have<br />  read mostly about <br />  Indus valley civilisation, Alexander the Great's<br />  forays, Gupta and <br />  Maurya periods, Mughal period including Shivaji, the<br />  British period <br />  and the fight for independence. The most detailed<br />  study concerning <br />  SI kings was about the Vijayanagar empire in the<br />  15th century AD. </p>
<p>    The Pallavas used to be dismissed in two paras and<br />  as far as I can <br />  remember there was next to nothing about the Cholas,<br />  let alone Raja <br />  Raja and Rajendra! That's the reason I was quite<br />  suprised to learn <br />  through this forum that Rajendra and Mohd of Gazni<br />  were <br />  contemporaries! And their paths could have crossed<br />  had Rajendra <br />  shifted his attention westwards from the Gangetic<br />  plains instead of <br />  going straight on the East coast.</p>
<p>    And I also never knew from the history lessons in<br />  school that he <br />  had defeated the Palas of Bengal. For that matter I<br />  have hardly <br />  learned anything in detail about the kingdoms of<br />  Bengal, Orissa, <br />  Karnataka or even Gujarat except that Gazni had<br />  plundered Somnath <br />  with repeated raids. Maharashtra escaped only<br />  because it produced a <br />  warrior like Shivaji and the long line of the<br />  Peshwas. I had not <br />  learned of even the kings who<br />    had built the magnificent temples in Kajuraho.</p>
<p>    And strangely I never learned in school that Malik<br />  Kafur had come <br />  deep down into South and attacked Madurai. Why, I<br />  did not know the <br />  name of Kafur till much later in life. </p>
<p>    Perhaps had I taken history in college I might<br />  have studied these <br />  in some more detail, but school is the place where<br />  the entire Indian <br />  history, and not only of Bihar, UP, Delhi and<br />  Punjab, should be <br />  taught. No wonder the northerners know so little<br />  about SI languages <br />  and culture! What a shame!</p>
<p>    What about the Dravidian parties who shout from<br />  the roof-tops <br />  about their love for Tamil and Tamil culture? They<br />  have done <br />  precious little to correct this serious anamoly. </p>
<p>    In fact only through PS did I learn a bit about<br />  the later Chola <br />  history and through SS some part of Pallava period.<br />  We need to <br />  salute Kalki for the yeoman service he has done to<br />  open the eyes of <br />  at least some readers of historical romances<br />  (dismissed as escapist <br />  fare by some people) about the achievements of some<br />  Tamil kings! </p>

<p>    Thank you.I feel that it is absolutely essential<br />  to have the works <br />  of all similar authors of Tamil historical fiction<br />  to be translated <br />  to English. This is crucial to show the world, what<br />  we can call, our <br />  treasures and our unique history. PS and<br />  Cilapathikaram are <br />  excellent translations. These translators should be<br />  commended a lot <br />  for their efforts and hopefully this should inspire<br />  them to <br />  translate more works. Parthiban Kanavu has a good<br />  translation as <br />  well. Can anyone tell me of available translations<br />  of all other <br />  works of Tamil Historical fiction.Sivapathasekaran<br />  <sps10142004@...  <br />  wrote: </sps10142004@...></p>

The below <br />  post by Vijay Kumar has propelled me to take the<br />  first step and <br />  hopefully time permitting, I look forward to regular<br />  contributions.  <br />    First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and<br />  I was introduced <br />  to PS through the excellent english translation by<br />  C.V Karthik <br />  Narayanan.

<p>    I am truly amazed by Mr Sandeep's posting. Is it true that even <br />in <br />  South India the South Indian history is dismissed in just two <br />pages. </p>
<p>    I thought it's the situation only in north, west and east of the <br />  country. Why didn't anyone, from the south who is an <br />  academic/scholar in Indian history, try and correct this <br />inequality <br />  or even injustice? As far as I am concerned I have read mostly <br />about <br />  Indus valley civilisation, Alexander the Great's forays, Gupta and <br />  Maurya periods, Mughal period including Shivaji, the British <br />period <br />  and the fight for independence. The most detailed study concerning <br />  SI kings was about the Vijayanagar empire in the 15th century AD. </p>
<p>    The Pallavas used to be dismissed in two paras and as far as I <br />can <br />  remember there was next to nothing about the Cholas, let alone <br />Raja <br />  Raja and Rajendra! That's the reason I was quite suprised to learn <br />  through this forum that Rajendra and Mohd of Gazni were <br />  contemporaries! And their paths could have crossed had Rajendra <br />  shifted his attention westwards from the Gangetic plains instead <br />of <br />  going straight on the East coast.</p>
<p>    And I also never knew from the history lessons in school that he <br />  had defeated the Palas of Bengal. For that matter I have hardly <br />  learned anything in detail about the kingdoms of Bengal, Orissa, <br />  Karnataka or even Gujarat except that Gazni had plundered Somnath <br />  with repeated raids. Maharashtra escaped only because it produced <br />a <br />  warrior like Shivaji and the long line of the Peshwas. I had not <br />  learned of even the kings who<br />    had built the magnificent temples in Kajuraho.</p>
<p>    And strangely I never learned in school that Malik Kafur had <br />come <br />  deep down into South and attacked Madurai. Why, I did not know the <br />  name of Kafur till much later in life. </p>
<p>    Perhaps had I taken history in college I might have studied <br />these <br />  in some more detail, but school is the place where the entire <br />Indian <br />  history, and not only of Bihar, UP, Delhi and Punjab, should be <br />  taught. No wonder the northerners know so little about SI <br />languages <br />  and culture! What a shame!</p>
<p>    What about the Dravidian parties who shout from the roof-tops <br />  about their love for Tamil and Tamil culture? They have done <br />  precious little to correct this serious anamoly. </p>
<p>    In fact only through PS did I learn a bit about the later Chola <br />  history and through SS some part of Pallava period. We need to <br />  salute Kalki for the yeoman service he has done to open the eyes <br />of <br />  at least some readers of historical romances (dismissed as <br />escapist <br />  fare by some people) about the achievements of some Tamil kings! </p>

<p>    Thank you.I feel that it is absolutely essential to have the <br />works <br />  of all similar authors of Tamil historical fiction to be <br />translated <br />  to English. This is crucial to show the world, what we can call, <br />our <br />  treasures and our unique history. PS and Cilapathikaram are <br />  excellent translations. These translators should be commended a <br />lot <br />  for their efforts and hopefully this should inspire them to <br />  translate more works. Parthiban Kanavu has a good translation as <br />  well. Can anyone tell me of available translations of all other <br />  works of Tamil Historical fiction.Sivapathasekaran <sps10142004@  <br />  wrote: </sps10142004@></p>

Its probably because I have a lot to say as well. The below <br />  post by Vijay Kumar has propelled me to take the first step and <br />  hopefully time permitting, I look forward to regular <br />contributions.  <br />    First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and I was <br />introduced <br />  to PS through the excellent english translation by C.V Karthik <br />  Narayanan. I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say <br />my <br />  8th standard till now (Im 40!). I am generally attracted to <br />  Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will <br />be <br />  the works of Ayn Rand.     I studied in a CBSE school and there <br />  would not have been more than a page or 2 about the South Indian <br />  Kings. It is such a terrible state of affairs that the only Indian <br />  kings who ruled kingdoms across the seas is hardly known in <br />present <br />  day India. What has caused this? I think we have to take the blame <br />  ourselves for it.     Even the great Ashoka who ruled most of <br />India <br />  did not rule the Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us <br />be <br />  dominated by others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. <br />This <br />  continues to this date so much so that a society is completely <br />  corrupted.    Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation <br />  states are fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and <br />  structures. We have to start by knowing and believing in our <br />  ancestry and building credible societies that have pride and <br />  dignity.

The <br />school <br />  is divided here.     There are those who think literature should <br />  serve to lift your   soul     and others who think it should do <br />  nothing of that sort.     I agree that Kalki's characterizations <br />and <br />  narrative style are     exemplary. But what is being served is <br />  escapist fare which helps   to     refocus your thoughts to a <br />  fictional world which has no relevance   to     the life you live. <br />I <br />  am not saying this is bad. This is true from     the Count of <br />Monte <br />  Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of     today. They <br />succeed <br />  in lifting you to a world which is magical and     but has little <br />  relevance to you or your life.    The question is not about <br />Kalki's <br />  skills as a writer. He has   proved     it to a large extent and <br />his <br />  social commitment is well-known.     When I read 'Crime and <br />  Punishment' I was able to connect directly     with the trails of <br />  the protoganist and was able to look life as it     will be lived <br />in <br />  a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner   workings     of your <br />  heart to such an extent that you change a little bit   inside     <br />  having read it. While the joy of reading PS is not questionable,   <br />  <br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.     <br />  This is because PS is written primarily as a escapist fare. The   <br />  <br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short   <br />  story.     Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha   <br />  <br />  wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the   <br />  <br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-  <br />  <br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine   <br />  (who     swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls <br />for <br />  the     hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a   <br />  saivite/vaishnavite)     and some inscription as base. Mix these <br />in <br />  different proportions   you     get 99% of all the stories in the <br />  history novel portfolio.     The formula is the reason why these <br />  novels are churned out in a     larger rate than the 'classics' as <br />  they are derisively called.     The 'classics' are difficult <br />because <br />  they are unique life     experiences and cannot be repeated. Take <br />  Asokamithran.     Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu     <br />  Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc.   <br />  Each     is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While <br />there <br />  is no     comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary <br />  worthiness     of the former is much higher than the later. I <br />  consider 'Thyaga     boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than <br />  PS for exactly the     same reason.

"Who is Asokamithran?" - <br />  Probably you didnt read my mail     clearly.       He         just <br />  chose the stories to be published. May be you should be         <br />  asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where     <br />  <br />  this         guy is. And FYI, Asokamithran has written some real <br />  good   novels         depicting life as it was lived and is <br />  considered one of the     great         novelists of our time. Not <br />  knowing him is one thing, abusing   him         actually shows <br />  ignorance.                 Again, I dont want this to degenerate <br />  into a personal duel. If     you         cannot read past two <br />pages <br />  of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai'     or 'Moga         mull', that is <br />  understandable but that does not anyway   depletes       the       <br />  <br />  place of that novel in contemperory literature.                 By <br />  that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS   but     <br />  <br />  has         read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it <br />  difficult to     read         even the title page). Thus, 'easier <br />to <br />  read' criteria does not       make         anything great or add <br />any <br />  literary value.                 Also the argument that it is likes <br />  by more people does not   hold         good.

Coming back to Venkatesh's point <br />  that we need to define what         literature is, I would think <br />any <br />  good literature to record   life     as         it is lived and <br />  should let you think beyond the reading.     Ofcourse,         <br />this <br />  is one person's view. What say you?

This         book            takes some <br />fine <br />  stories from the first 10 years of     Kanaiyazhi         (1964-  <br />  <br />          74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.            There <br />is <br />  a very funny, satirical take on Kalki,   Sandilyan's       style  <br />  <br />          of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon.     <br />  <br />  Apparently            this is his only story. The story is two <br />  episodes (Episode     300         and            301) of a long <br />  running historical ovel in a weekly and a     piece       of      <br />  <br />      the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the    <br />  <br />        episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking   <br />  <br />    about         the            literary criticisms levelled at <br />PS.  <br />            Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was <br />enamoured <br />      by       the            romanticness of it, I actually moved <br />  away from it during   my         college            days(I studied <br />  in GCE, Tirunelvely).            For what reasons? because it is a <br />  romantic novel and   reading     it            doesnt alter one <br />  thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are     those         of us    <br />  <br />        who got interested in their history but I think the     <br />  percentage       is            much lower . But being a romantic <br />  novel, there is no point   in            looking for things to <br />  improve upon the soul also. I dont     read,            <br />say, 'Three <br />  musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to   do       that       <br />  <br />  I            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <br />  PS   for       the            sheer joy or it and if I want to <br />read <br />  to improve upon the       soul, I            will be reading <br />a 'Moga <br />  mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.            One book I read page by <br />page <br />  for about a month with lots of            thinking is 'JJ sila <br />  kurippugal' I still remember the     mocking         words        <br />  <br />    by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the       <br />  novel 'Sivagami            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri <br />  vittala?' This scathing       remark            criticizes <br />  romanicism at its extreme and questioning the         escapism in  <br />  <br />          life.                       The point here is not to throw <br />  mud on PS. You can simply     call         this            between <br />  any romantic novel vs a much realistic one.

Awaiting <br /></preciousfeeling@></blockquote><p>more.regards / sps==============  Hi    Although I have been lurking <br />here for a while, I havent participated directly in the discussions <br />here. Its probably because I have a lot to say as well. The below <br />post by Vijay Kumar has propelled me to take the first step and <br />hopefully time permitting, I look forward to regular contributions.  <br /></p><blockquote>  First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and I was introduced <br />to PS through the excellent english translation by C.V Karthik <br /></blockquote><p>Narayanan. I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say my <br />8th standard till now (Im 40!). I am generally attracted to <br />Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will be <br />the works of Ayn Rand.     I studied in a CBSE school and there <br />would not have been more than a page or 2 about the South Indian <br />Kings. It is such a terrible state of affairs that the only Indian <br />kings who ruled kingdoms across the seas is hardly known in present <br />day India. What has caused this? I think we have to take the blame <br />ourselves for it.     Even the great Ashoka who ruled most of India <br />did not rule the Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us be <br />dominated by others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. This <br />continues to this date so much so that a society is completely <br />corrupted.    Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation <br />states are fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and <br />structures. We have to start by knowing and believing in our <br />ancestry and building credible societies that have pride and <br />dignity.    More later  Sandeep  "Vijay Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@  <br />wrote: to me, before i read PS, the greatest king in india was <br />Asoka, the   greatest act an indian king did was kalinga war, his <br />greatest   contribution to the kingdom was planting trees... jainism <br />was from   distant northindia followed by a few white clad monks <br />wearning face   masks, or yearly rituals to a huge naked statue of <br />sravanabelagola,   srilanka was a battle torn wilderness ( ok ten <br />years ago i would   look forward to the lux soaps n body spray <br />bought by visitors from   there)    PS opened my eyes to the <br />greatness that has been forgotten ( or   bulldozed) by north indian <br />versions of indian history compulsorily   infused into our school <br />history..to dwell deeper and realise the   real greatness - lets <br />call it true fame..meikirti. before that south   indian kings were <br />shivaji, gemini ganesh, mgr wearing grandeose   costumes, buxom <br />queens ...- singing songs around flower beds in the   <br />nandavanams/andahpurams, some sword fighting holding the heroine in <br /></vj_episteme@></p><blockquote>  one hand ( enjoyed it though) - some poor kavalali shouting raja <br />thi   raja, raja marthanda...    to look at tanjore big temple, <br /></blockquote><p>mahabalipuram in new light - not just   taking an occasional visitor <br />on a sightseeing trip - gawking at all   the white skins there ` <br />appreciating the stone work"...now a days   its more a spiritual <br />feeling, its no longer just stone or a statue.   each one has a <br />story to tell.    when you read of the conquests of these kings 1000 <br />years ago and   finding proofs of their conquests in far away <br />lands....to be able to   administer their vast country, to be just, <br />to be loved by their   subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage <br />war across the seas...i   can roll back my eyes and hear the battle <br />cries of chozam chozam and   payum vengai kodi bearing troops <br />capturing forts in distant lanka,   malaysia and indonesia - <br />victoriously proclaiming to the world the   greatness of the <br />tamilnadu.    i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya <br />history to be   more correctly portrayed in our primary and <br />secondary educational   material than just a passing mention. i <br />would love my son ( he is   just learning to read and write) to read <br />PS and understand the   greatness of the land he hails from.    vj  <br /></p><blockquote>  --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Muthu Prakash R"   <br /><mprakas@  wrote:       The important question that is being raised <br /></mprakas@></blockquote><p>again is whether     literature should serve any purpose. The school <br />is divided here.     There are those who think literature should <br />serve to lift your   soul     and others who think it should do <br />nothing of that sort.     I agree that Kalki's characterizations and <br />narrative style are     exemplary. But what is being served is <br />escapist fare which helps   to     refocus your thoughts to a <br />fictional world which has no relevance   to     the life you live. I <br />am not saying this is bad. This is true from     the Count of Monte <br />Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of     today. They succeed <br />in lifting you to a world which is magical and     but has little <br />relevance to you or your life.    The question is not about Kalki's <br />skills as a writer. He has   proved     it to a large extent and his <br />social commitment is well-known.     When I read 'Crime and <br />Punishment' I was able to connect directly     with the trails of <br />the protoganist and was able to look life as it     will be lived in <br />a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner   workings     of your <br />heart to such an extent that you change a little bit   inside     <br />having read it. While the joy of reading PS is not questionable,     <br />there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.     <br />This is because PS is written primarily as a escapist fare. The     <br />entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short   <br />story.     Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha     <br />wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the     <br />workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-    <br />climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine   <br />(who     swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for <br />the     hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a   <br />saivite/vaishnavite)     and some inscription as base. Mix these in <br />different proportions   you     get 99% of all the stories in the <br />history novel portfolio.     The formula is the reason why these <br />novels are churned out in a     larger rate than the 'classics' as <br />they are derisively called.     The 'classics' are difficult because <br />they are unique life     experiences and cannot be repeated. Take <br />Asokamithran.     Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu     <br />Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc.   <br />Each     is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there <br />is no     comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary <br />worthiness     of the former is much higher than the later. I <br />consider 'Thyaga     boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than <br />PS for exactly the     same reason.

May be you should be         <br />asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where       <br />this         guy is. And FYI, Asokamithran has written some real <br />good   novels         depicting life as it was lived and is <br />considered one of the     great         novelists of our time. Not <br />knowing him is one thing, abusing   him         actually shows <br />ignorance.                 Again, I dont want this to degenerate <br />into a personal duel. If     you         cannot read past two pages <br />of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai'     or 'Moga         mull', that is <br />understandable but that does not anyway   depletes       the         <br />place of that novel in contemperory literature.                 By <br />that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS   but       <br />has         read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it <br />difficult to     read         even the title page). Thus, 'easier to <br />read' criteria does not       make         anything great or add any <br />literary value.                 Also the argument that it is likes <br />by more people does not   hold         good. We elect guys whom most <br />people vote for and look at our         assembly and parliament to <br />see what we get.                 Coming back to Venkatesh's point <br />that we need to define what         literature is, I would think any <br />good literature to record   life     as         it is lived and <br />should let you think beyond the reading.     Ofcourse,         this <br />is one person's view. What say you?                The question <br />still holds, What, if any, is the literary value   of         PS/SS?<br /></p><blockquote>                Do answer the question without going into rage <br />against       Asokamithran,         Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin <br /></blockquote><p>Kathai etc.                Muthu Prakash R                --- In <br /><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Udanx <udanks@  wrote:               <br /></udanks@></p><blockquote>    I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn Kadhai.

This         book            takes some fine <br />stories from the first 10 years of     Kanaiyazhi         (1964-    <br /></p><blockquote>        74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.            There is <br />a very funny, satirical take on Kalki,   Sandilyan's       style    <br />        of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon.       <br />Apparently            this is his only story. The story is two <br /></blockquote><p>episodes (Episode     300         and            301) of a long <br />running historical ovel in a weekly and a     piece       of        <br /></p><blockquote>    the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the      <br />      episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking     <br />  about         the            literary criticisms levelled at PS.  <br />          Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />    by       the            romanticness of it, I actually moved <br />away from it during   my         college            days(I studied <br /></blockquote><p>in GCE, Tirunelvely).            For what reasons? because it is a <br />romantic novel and   reading     it            doesnt alter one <br />thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are     those         of us      <br /></p><blockquote>      who got interested in their history but I think the     <br />percentage       is            much lower . But being a romantic <br /></blockquote><p>novel, there is no point   in            looking for things to <br />improve upon the soul also. I dont     read,            say, 'Three <br />musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to   do       that         <br />I            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <br />PS   for       the            sheer joy or it and if I want to read <br />to improve upon the       soul, I            will be reading a 'Moga <br />mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.            One book I read page by page <br />for about a month with lots of            thinking is 'JJ sila <br />kurippugal' I still remember the     mocking         words          <br /></p><blockquote>  by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the       <br />novel 'Sivagami            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri <br /></blockquote><p>vittala?' This scathing       remark            criticizes <br />romanicism at its extreme and questioning the         escapism in    <br /></p><blockquote>        life.                       The point here is not to throw <br />mud on PS. You can simply     call         this            between <br /></blockquote><p>any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I   chose     to         <br />call            it PS because this a PS group. My question is this  <br /></p><blockquote>                     What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?  <br />                     Muthu Prakash R                                <br />             ------------------------------            Check out <br />some new online services at Windows Live Ideas&#151;  so       new       <br />  they            haven't even been officially released yet.

<p>Its but ironical that the very people in power ( since 1967 only <br />regional parties have held power) who epitomise tamil culture cannot <br />do anything ( even to bring back the archives from mysore ) - let <br />alone the volumes which are in private collections of art buffs in <br />europe and america - these kings had the fortitude to leave behind <br />documented proofs of their conquests etched into stone n leaf - and <br />they too have done their duty by carrying their message to this day -<br />but they sit alone in dusty rooms of archives/museums/art <br />collectors attics - silently mocking at us.....we are truely <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  <br />irunthum kurudargal. </acronym></p>

Awaiting <br /></preciousfeeling@></blockquote><p>more.regards / sps==============  Hi    Although I have been lurking <br />here for a while, I havent participated directly in the discussions <br />here. Its probably because I have a lot to say as well. The below <br />post by Vijay Kumar has propelled me to take the first step and <br />hopefully time permitting, I look forward to regular contributions.  <br /></p><blockquote>  First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and I was introduced <br />to PS through the excellent english translation by C.V Karthik <br /></blockquote><p>Narayanan. I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say my <br />8th standard till now (Im 40!). I am generally attracted to <br />Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will be <br />the works of Ayn Rand.     I studied in a CBSE school and there <br />would not have been more than a page or 2 about the South Indian <br />Kings. It is such a terrible state of affairs that the only Indian <br />kings who ruled kingdoms across the seas is hardly known in present <br />day India. What has caused this? I think we have to take the blame <br />ourselves for it.     Even the great Ashoka who ruled most of India <br />did not rule the Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us be <br />dominated by others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. This <br />continues to this date so much so that a society is completely <br />corrupted.    Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation <br />states are fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and <br />structures. We have to start by knowing and believing in our <br />ancestry and building credible societies that have pride and <br />dignity.    More later  Sandeep  "Vijay Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@  <br />wrote: to me, before i read PS, the greatest king in india was <br />Asoka, the   greatest act an indian king did was kalinga war, his <br />greatest   contribution to the kingdom was planting trees... jainism <br />was from   distant northindia followed by a few white clad monks <br />wearning face   masks, or yearly rituals to a huge naked statue of <br />sravanabelagola,   srilanka was a battle torn wilderness ( ok ten <br />years ago i would   look forward to the lux soaps n body spray <br />bought by visitors from   there)    PS opened my eyes to the <br />greatness that has been forgotten ( or   bulldozed) by north indian <br />versions of indian history compulsorily   infused into our school <br />history..to dwell deeper and realise the   real greatness - lets <br />call it true fame..meikirti. before that south   indian kings were <br />shivaji, gemini ganesh, mgr wearing grandeose   costumes, buxom <br />queens ...- singing songs around flower beds in the   <br />nandavanams/andahpurams, some sword fighting holding the heroine in <br /></vj_episteme@></p><blockquote>  one hand ( enjoyed it though) - some poor kavalali shouting raja <br />thi   raja, raja marthanda...    to look at tanjore big temple, <br /></blockquote><p>mahabalipuram in new light - not just   taking an occasional visitor <br />on a sightseeing trip - gawking at all   the white skins there ` <br />appreciating the stone work"...now a days   its more a spiritual <br />feeling, its no longer just stone or a statue.   each one has a <br />story to tell.    when you read of the conquests of these kings 1000 <br />years ago and   finding proofs of their conquests in far away <br />lands....to be able to   administer their vast country, to be just, <br />to be loved by their   subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage <br />war across the seas...i   can roll back my eyes and hear the battle <br />cries of chozam chozam and   payum vengai kodi bearing troops <br />capturing forts in distant lanka,   malaysia and indonesia - <br />victoriously proclaiming to the world the   greatness of the <br />tamilnadu.    i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya <br />history to be   more correctly portrayed in our primary and <br />secondary educational   material than just a passing mention. i <br />would love my son ( he is   just learning to read and write) to read <br />PS and understand the   greatness of the land he hails from.    vj  <br /></p><blockquote>  --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Muthu Prakash R"   <br /><mprakas@  wrote:       The important question that is being raised <br /></mprakas@></blockquote><p>again is whether     literature should serve any purpose. The school <br />is divided here.     There are those who think literature should <br />serve to lift your   soul     and others who think it should do <br />nothing of that sort.     I agree that Kalki's characterizations and <br />narrative style are     exemplary. But what is being served is <br />escapist fare which helps   to     refocus your thoughts to a <br />fictional world which has no relevance   to     the life you live. I <br />am not saying this is bad. This is true from     the Count of Monte <br />Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of     today. They succeed <br />in lifting you to a world which is magical and     but has little <br />relevance to you or your life.    The question is not about Kalki's <br />skills as a writer. He has   proved     it to a large extent and his <br />social commitment is well-known.     When I read 'Crime and <br />Punishment' I was able to connect directly     with the trails of <br />the protoganist and was able to look life as it     will be lived in <br />a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner   workings     of your <br />heart to such an extent that you change a little bit   inside     <br />having read it. While the joy of reading PS is not questionable,     <br />there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul.     <br />This is because PS is written primarily as a escapist fare. The     <br />entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short   <br />story.     Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha     <br />wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the     <br />workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-    <br />climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine   <br />(who     swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for <br />the     hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a   <br />saivite/vaishnavite)     and some inscription as base. Mix these in <br />different proportions   you     get 99% of all the stories in the <br />history novel portfolio.     The formula is the reason why these <br />novels are churned out in a     larger rate than the 'classics' as <br />they are derisively called.     The 'classics' are difficult because <br />they are unique life     experiences and cannot be repeated. Take <br />Asokamithran.     Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu     <br />Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc.   <br />Each     is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there <br />is no     comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary <br />worthiness     of the former is much higher than the later. I <br />consider 'Thyaga     boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than <br />PS for exactly the     same reason.

If     you         cannot read past two pages <br />of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai'     or 'Moga         mull', that is <br />understandable but that does not anyway   depletes       the         <br />place of that novel in contemperory literature.                 By <br />that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS   but       <br />has         read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it <br />difficult to     read         even the title page). Thus, 'easier to <br />read' criteria does not       make         anything great or add any <br />literary value.                 Also the argument that it is likes <br />by more people does not   hold         good. We elect guys whom most <br />people vote for and look at our         assembly and parliament to <br />see what we get.                 Coming back to Venkatesh's point <br />that we need to define what         literature is, I would think any <br />good literature to record   life     as         it is lived and <br />should let you think beyond the reading.     Ofcourse,         this <br />is one person's view. What say you?                The question <br />still holds, What, if any, is the literary value   of         PS/SS?<br /></p><blockquote>                Do answer the question without going into rage <br />against       Asokamithran,         Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin <br /></blockquote><p>Kathai etc.                Muthu Prakash R                --- In <br /><a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Udanx <udanks@  wrote:               <br /></udanks@></p><blockquote>    I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn Kadhai.

This         book            takes some fine <br />stories from the first 10 years of     Kanaiyazhi         (1964-    <br /></p><blockquote>        74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.            There is <br />a very funny, satirical take on Kalki,   Sandilyan's       style    <br />        of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon.       <br />Apparently            this is his only story. The story is two <br /></blockquote><p>episodes (Episode     300         and            301) of a long <br />running historical ovel in a weekly and a     piece       of        <br /></p><blockquote>    the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the      <br />      episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking     <br />  about         the            literary criticisms levelled at PS.  <br />          Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />    by       the            romanticness of it, I actually moved <br />away from it during   my         college            days(I studied <br /></blockquote><p>in GCE, Tirunelvely).            For what reasons? because it is a <br />romantic novel and   reading     it            doesnt alter one <br />thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are     those         of us      <br /></p><blockquote>      who got interested in their history but I think the     <br />percentage       is            much lower . But being a romantic <br /></blockquote><p>novel, there is no point   in            looking for things to <br />improve upon the soul also. I dont     read,            say, 'Three <br />musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to   do       that         <br />I            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <br />PS   for       the            sheer joy or it and if I want to read <br />to improve upon the       soul, I            will be reading a 'Moga <br />mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.            One book I read page by page <br />for about a month with lots of            thinking is 'JJ sila <br />kurippugal' I still remember the     mocking         words          <br /></p><blockquote>  by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the       <br />novel 'Sivagami            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri <br /></blockquote><p>vittala?' This scathing       remark            criticizes <br />romanicism at its extreme and questioning the         escapism in    <br /></p><blockquote>        life.                       The point here is not to throw <br />mud on PS. You can simply     call         this            between <br /></blockquote><p>any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I   chose     to         <br />call            it PS because this a PS group.

        <p>hi happy to see the post has touched a few chords and evoked a string <br />of stirring responses. On one side english translations are wanted to <br />give a global reach for these works, but then its not often that you <br />can get the essense of tamil completely into another language. maybe <br />we should also look at the great work put in by the podcasters - i did <br />listen to <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  by sashi vaidyanathan</p>
<p><a href="http://www.podbazaar.com/view/144115188075856911" title="http://www.podbazaar.com/view/144115188075856911">http://www.podbazaar.com/view/144115188075856911</a></p>
<p>Its quite easy to do this, ( though the reach is only to the tamil <br />population - you do reach the fringes where they understand tamil but <br />do not know how to read....) - podcasting is much easier than <br />translating and you could do it at leisure - one chapter at a time and <br />keep the interest alive...all you need is a computer with some basic <br />mike/speakers and a decent internet connection. the audience can <br />download these and listen via mp3 players, mobile phones instead of <br />drab ear jarring tunes of today..</p>
<p>Maybe, it would be easier for teachers to play these mp3 tapes to <br />their students and make them learn tamil faster....proper tamil not <br />the anglicised versions of today....or madras tamil.</p>

<p>when you read of the conquests of these kings 1000 years ago and <br />finding proofs of their conquests in far away lands....to be able to <br />administer their vast country, to be just, to be loved by their <br />subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage war across the seas...i <br />can roll back my eyes and hear the battle cries of chozam chozam and <br />payum vengai kodi bearing troops capturing forts in distant lanka, <br />malaysia and indonesia - victoriously proclaiming to the world the <br />greatness of the tamilnadu.</p>
<p>i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya history to be <br />more correctly portrayed in our primary and secondary educational <br />material than just a passing mention. i would love my son ( he is <br />just learning to read and write) to read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and understand the <br />greatness of the land he hails from.</acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  The important question that is being raised again is whether <br />  literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here. <br />  There are those who think literature should serve to lift your <br />soul <br />  and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />  I agree that Kalki's characterizations and narrative style are <br />  exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps <br />to <br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance <br />to <br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from <br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and <br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki's skills as a writer. He has <br />proved <br />  it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />  When I read 'Crime and Punishment' I was able to connect directly <br />  with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it <br />  will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner <br />workings <br />  of your heart to such an extent that you change a little bit <br />inside <br />  having read it. While the joy of reading PS is not questionable, <br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />  This is because PS is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short <br />story. <br />  Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha <br />  wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the <br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-<br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine <br />(who <br />  swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for the <br />  hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a <br />saivite/vaishnavite) <br />  and some inscription as base. Mix these in different proportions <br />you <br />  get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />  The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />  larger rate than the 'classics' as they are derisively called. <br />  The 'classics' are difficult because they are unique life <br />  experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />  Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu <br />  Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc. <br />Each <br />  is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is no <br />  comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary worthiness <br />  of the former is much higher than the later. I consider 'Thyaga <br />  boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than PS for exactly the <br />  same reason.</p>

<p>    hi sirs,</p>
<p>    to anyone who has read kalki's works - the first thing you <br />  realise, <br />    is that you are transported into the respective era. you live <br />the <br />    novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that is <br />  the <br />    foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can do <br />    that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime a <br />    dozen movies released everyday - the fact that ss and ps still <br />  hold <br />    their own.</p>
<p>    the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />    background research that has gone into the historic fiction ( i <br />  dont <br />    think you can straight away classify ps as a romance ...ss to <br />some <br />    extent) - to think of a novel written from the remanents of <br />three <br />    culverts - and to spin a web that had ( and is still is) <br />capturing <br />    the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in these <br />    works.</p>
<p>    lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />    characters or the fictional ones - Kalki's portrayal of each and <br />    every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them is <br />  the <br />    crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />    glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life and <br />    blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown to <br />  be <br />    calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.</p>
<p>    if you poll in this site - how many people picked up ps or ss <br />and <br />    finished it without a break when compared to other works is but <br />    enough proof.</p>

<p>      One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />    everyone <br />      else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />  inferior <br />      feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated with <br />the <br />      reading itself.</p>
<p>      "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />  clearly. <br />    He <br />      just chose the stories to be published. May be you should be <br />      asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where <br />    this <br />      guy is. And FYI, Asokamithran has written some real good <br />novels <br />      depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />  great <br />      novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing <br />him <br />      actually shows ignorance. </p>
<p>      Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If <br />  you <br />      cannot read past two pages of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai' <br />  or 'Moga <br />      mull', that is understandable but that does not anyway <br />depletes <br />    the <br />      place of that novel in contemperory literature. </p>
<p>      By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS <br />but <br />    has <br />      read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it difficult to <br />  read <br />      even the title page). Thus, 'easier to read' criteria does not <br />    make <br />      anything great or add any literary value. </p>
<p>      Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not <br />hold <br />      good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our <br />      assembly and parliament to see what we get. </p>
<p>      Coming back to Venkatesh's point that we need to define what <br />      literature is, I would think any good literature to record <br />life <br />  as <br />      it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />  Ofcourse, <br />      this is one person's view. What say you?</p>
<p>      The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value <br />of <br />      PS/SS?</p>
<p>      Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />    Asokamithran, <br />      Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.</p>

<p>          The criticism that Kali's writings and historical <br />romances <br />    are <br />      escapist<br />          fares are nothing new. They are age-old.

And talking of Moha Mull, I <br />have <br />      tried to read it<br />          any no of times but was unable to go beyond page two. What <br />  do <br />      you have to<br />          say about this. All I, and many readers for that matter, <br />  look <br />      forward to is<br />          an interesting story, well-told.

<p>          ------------------------------<br />          To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />          From: mprakas@<br />          Date: Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:32:03 +0000<br />          Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Criticisms on PS</p>
<p>          All</p>
<p>          I was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'. <br />  This <br />      book<br />          takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of <br />  Kanaiyazhi <br />      (1964-<br />          74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.<br />          There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, <br />Sandilyan's <br />    style<br />          of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon. <br />    Apparently<br />          this is his only story. The story is two episodes (Episode <br />  300 <br />      and<br />          301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a <br />  piece <br />    of<br />          the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />          episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking <br />    about <br />      the<br />          literary criticisms levelled at PS.<br />          Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />  by <br />    the<br />          romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during <br />my <br />      college<br />          days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).<br />          For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and <br />reading <br />  it<br />          doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are <br />  those <br />      of us<br />          who got interested in their history but I think the <br />  percentage <br />    is<br />          much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point <br />in<br />          looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont <br />  read,<br />          say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to <br />do <br />    that <br />      I<br />          will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read PS <br />for <br />    the<br />          sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the <br />    soul, I<br />          will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.<br />          One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />          thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the <br />  mocking <br />      words<br />          by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />    novel 'Sivagami<br />          ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing <br />    remark<br />          criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />      escapism in<br />          life.</p>
<p>          The point here is not to throw mud on PS. You can simply <br />  call <br />      this<br />          between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I <br />chose <br />  to <br />      call<br />          it PS because this a PS group. My question is this</p>
<p>          What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I feel that it is absolutely essential to have the works of all similar authors of Tamil historical fiction to be translated to English. This is crucial to show the world, what we can call, our treasures and our unique history. </p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and Cilapathikaram are excellent translations. These translators should be commended a lot for their efforts and hopefully this should inspire them to translate more works. Parthiban Kanavu has a good translation as well. Can anyone tell me of available translations of all other works of Tamil Historical fiction.</p>

The <br />    entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short <br />  story. <br />    Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha <br />    wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on <br />the <br />    workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-<br />    climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine <br />  (who <br />    swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for the <br />    hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a <br />  saivite/vaishnavite) <br />    and some inscription as base. Mix these in different <br />proportions <br />  you <br />    get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />    The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />    larger rate than the 'classics' as they are derisively called. <br />    The 'classics' are difficult because they are unique life <br />    experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />    Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu <br />    Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc. <br />  Each <br />    is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is <br />no <br />    comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary <br />worthiness <br />    of the former is much higher than the later. I consider 'Thyaga <br />    boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than PS for exactly <br />the <br />    same reason.<br />    <br />    Muthu Prakash R<br />    <br />    --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />    <vj_episteme@  wrote:<br />     <br />      hi sirs,<br />      <br />      to anyone who has read kalki's works - the first thing you <br />    realise, <br />      is that you are transported into the respective era. you live <br />  the <br />      novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that <br />is <br />    the <br />      foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can <br />do <br />      that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime <br />a <br />      dozen movies released everyday - the fact that ss and ps <br />still <br />    hold <br />      their own.<br />      <br />      the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />      background research that has gone into the historic fiction ( <br />i <br />    dont <br />      think you can straight away classify ps as a romance ...ss to <br />  some <br />      extent) - to think of a novel written from the remanents of <br />  three <br />      culverts - and to spin a web that had ( and is still is) <br />  capturing <br />      the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in <br />these <br />      works.<br />      <br />      lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />      characters or the fictional ones - Kalki's portrayal of each <br />and <br />      every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them <br />is <br />    the <br />      crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />      glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life <br />and <br />      blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown <br />to <br />    be <br />      calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.<br />      <br />      if you poll in this site - how many people picked up ps or ss <br />  and <br />      finished it without a break when compared to other works is <br />but <br />      enough proof.<br />      <br />      rgds<br />      vj<br />      <br />      <br />      --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Muthu Prakash R" <br />      <mprakas@  wrote:<br />       <br />        One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />      everyone <br />        else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />    inferior <br />        feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated <br />with <br />  the <br />        reading itself.<br />        <br />        "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />    clearly. <br />      He <br />        just chose the stories to be published. May be you should <br />be <br />        asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know <br />where <br />      this <br />        guy is. And FYI, Asokamithran has written some real good <br />  novels <br />        depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />    great <br />        novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, <br />abusing <br />  him <br />        actually shows ignorance. <br />        <br />        Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. <br />If <br />    you <br />        cannot read past two pages of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai' <br />    or 'Moga <br />        mull', that is understandable but that does not anyway <br />  depletes <br />      the <br />        place of that novel in contemperory literature. <br />        <br />        By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS <br />  but <br />      has <br />        read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it difficult <br />to <br />    read <br />        even the title page). Thus, 'easier to read' criteria does <br />not <br />      make <br />        anything great or add any literary value. <br />        <br />        Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not <br />  hold <br />        good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at <br />our <br />        assembly and parliament to see what we get. <br />        <br />        Coming back to Venkatesh's point that we need to define <br />what <br />        literature is, I would think any good literature to record <br />  life <br />    as <br />        it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />    Ofcourse, <br />        this is one person's view. What say you?<br />        <br />        The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary <br />value <br />  of <br />        PS/SS?<br />        <br />        Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />      Asokamithran, <br />        Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.<br />        <br />        Muthu Prakash R<br />        <br />        --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Udanx <udanks@  <br />wrote:<br />         <br />          I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn <br />Kadhai. <br />  I <br />        have heard<br />          thats the best book ever written.

The story is two episodes <br />(Episode <br />    300 <br />        and<br />            301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and <br />a <br />    piece <br />      of<br />            the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of <br />the<br />            episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into <br />thinking <br />      about <br />        the<br />            literary criticisms levelled at PS.<br />            Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was <br />enamoured <br />    by <br />      the<br />            romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it <br />during <br />  my <br />        college<br />            days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).<br />            For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and <br />  reading <br />    it<br />            doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there <br />are <br />    those <br />        of us<br />            who got interested in their history but I think the <br />    percentage <br />      is<br />            much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no <br />point <br />  in<br />            looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I <br />dont <br />    read,<br />            say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want <br />to <br />  do <br />      that <br />        I<br />            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <br />PS <br />  for <br />      the<br />            sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon <br />the <br />      soul, I<br />            will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.<br />            One book I read page by page for about a month with <br />lots of<br />            thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the <br />    mocking <br />        words<br />            by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />      novel 'Sivagami<br />            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This <br />scathing <br />      remark<br />            criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning <br />the <br />        escapism in<br />            life.<br />           <br />            The point here is not to throw mud on PS. You can <br />simply <br />    call <br />        this<br />            between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I <br />  chose <br />    to <br />        call<br />            it PS because this a PS group. My question is this<br />           <br />            What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?<br />           <br />            Muthu Prakash R<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            ------------------------------<br />            Check out some new online services at Windows Live <br />Ideas&#151;   so <br />      new <br />        they<br />            haven't even been officially released yet.

The school is divided <br />here. <br />    There are those who think literature should serve to lift your <br />  soul <br />    and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />    I agree that Kalki's characterizations and narrative style are <br />    exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which <br />helps <br />  to <br />    refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no <br />relevance <br />  to <br />    the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true <br />from <br />    the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />    today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical <br />and <br />    but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />    The question is not about Kalki's skills as a writer. He has <br />  proved <br />    it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />    When I read 'Crime and Punishment' I was able to connect <br />directly <br />    with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as <br />it <br />    will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner <br />  workings <br />    of your heart to such an extent that you change a little bit <br />  inside <br />    having read it. While the joy of reading PS is not <br />questionable, <br />    there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />    This is because PS is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />    entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short <br />  story. <br />    Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha <br />    wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on <br />the <br />    workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-<br />    climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine <br />  (who <br />    swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for the <br />    hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a <br />  saivite/vaishnavite) <br />    and some inscription as base. Mix these in different <br />proportions <br />  you <br />    get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />    The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />    larger rate than the 'classics' as they are derisively called. <br />    The 'classics' are difficult because they are unique life <br />    experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />    Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu <br />    Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc. <br />  Each <br />    is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is <br />no <br />    comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary <br />worthiness <br />    of the former is much higher than the later. I consider 'Thyaga <br />    boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than PS for exactly <br />the <br />    same reason.<br />    <br />    Muthu Prakash R<br />    <br />    --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br />    <vj_episteme@  wrote:<br />     <br />      hi sirs,<br />      <br />      to anyone who has read kalki's works - the first thing you <br />    realise, <br />      is that you are transported into the respective era. you live <br />  the <br />      novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that <br />is <br />    the <br />      foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can <br />do <br />      that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime <br />a <br />      dozen movies released everyday - the fact that ss and ps <br />still <br />    hold <br />      their own.<br />      <br />      the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />      background research that has gone into the historic fiction ( <br />i <br />    dont <br />      think you can straight away classify ps as a romance ...ss to <br />  some <br />      extent) - to think of a novel written from the remanents of <br />  three <br />      culverts - and to spin a web that had ( and is still is) <br />  capturing <br />      the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in <br />these <br />      works.<br />      <br />      lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />      characters or the fictional ones - Kalki's portrayal of each <br />and <br />      every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them <br />is <br />    the <br />      crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />      glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life <br />and <br />      blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown <br />to <br />    be <br />      calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.<br />      <br />      if you poll in this site - how many people picked up ps or ss <br />  and <br />      finished it without a break when compared to other works is <br />but <br />      enough proof.<br />      <br />      rgds<br />      vj<br />      <br />      <br />      --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Muthu Prakash R" <br />      <mprakas@  wrote:<br />       <br />        One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />      everyone <br />        else as connoisseurs/elitist.

May be you should <br />be <br />        asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know <br />where <br />      this <br />        guy is. And FYI, Asokamithran has written some real good <br />  novels <br />        depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />    great <br />        novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, <br />abusing <br />  him <br />        actually shows ignorance. <br />        <br />        Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. <br />If <br />    you <br />        cannot read past two pages of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai' <br />    or 'Moga <br />        mull', that is understandable but that does not anyway <br />  depletes <br />      the <br />        place of that novel in contemperory literature. <br />        <br />        By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS <br />  but <br />      has <br />        read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it difficult <br />to <br />    read <br />        even the title page). Thus, 'easier to read' criteria does <br />not <br />      make <br />        anything great or add any literary value. <br />        <br />        Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not <br />  hold <br />        good.

The story is two episodes <br />(Episode <br />    300 <br />        and<br />            301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and <br />a <br />    piece <br />      of<br />            the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of <br />the<br />            episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into <br />thinking <br />      about <br />        the<br />            literary criticisms levelled at PS.<br />            Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was <br />enamoured <br />    by <br />      the<br />            romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it <br />during <br />  my <br />        college<br />            days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).<br />            For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and <br />  reading <br />    it<br />            doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there <br />are <br />    those <br />        of us<br />            who got interested in their history but I think the <br />    percentage <br />      is<br />            much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no <br />point <br />  in<br />            looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I <br />dont <br />    read,<br />            say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want <br />to <br />  do <br />      that <br />        I<br />            will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read <br />PS <br />  for <br />      the<br />            sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon <br />the <br />      soul, I<br />            will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.<br />            One book I read page by page for about a month with <br />lots of<br />            thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the <br />    mocking <br />        words<br />            by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />      novel 'Sivagami<br />            ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This <br />scathing <br />      remark<br />            criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning <br />the <br />        escapism in<br />            life.<br />           <br />            The point here is not to throw mud on PS. You can <br />simply <br />    call <br />        this<br />            between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I <br />  chose <br />    to <br />        call<br />            it PS because this a PS group. My question is this<br />           <br />            What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?<br />           <br />            Muthu Prakash R<br />           <br />           <br />           <br />            ------------------------------<br />            Check out some new online services at Windows Live <br />Ideas?<br />  so <br />      new <br />        they<br />            haven't even been officially released yet.

        <p>I think literature should exist in all forms. It will be difficult to compare say Ayn Rand's Fountain Head or Atlas Shrugged with for instance the works of Kalki but then again I feel both present the same sense of life. </p>
<p>Kalki has in very simple words created a beautiful sense of life, portrayed the period in a simple yet eloquent way and as a result has given these unique characters in our history a new life and 'due' that they truly deserve. </p>
<p>I feel his work is absolutely essential for our society as it is easy and interesting for many to like, as well as, get the greater picture. I think we really need the greater picture in today's world.</p>

<p>The Ray Bradbury novel Fahrenheit 451 is about a fictional future <br />society that has institutionalized book burning. In Orwell's Nineteen <br />Eighty-Four, the euphemistically-called "memory hole" is used to burn <br />any book or written text which is inconvenient to the regime, and <br />there is mention of "the total destruction of all books published <br />before 1960".</p>

<blockquote><p>  The important question that is being raised again is whether <br />  literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here. <br />  There are those who think literature should serve to lift your soul <br />  and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />  I agree that Kalki's characterizations and narrative style are <br />  exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps to <br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance <br />to <br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from <br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and <br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki's skills as a writer. He has proved <br />  it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />  When I read 'Crime and Punishment' I was able to connect directly <br />  with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it <br />  will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner workings <br />  of your heart to such an extent that you change a little bit inside <br />  having read it. While the joy of reading PS is not questionable, <br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />  This is because PS is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short story. <br />  Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha <br />  wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the <br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-<br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine <br />(who <br />  swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for the <br />  hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a saivite/vaishnavite) <br />  and some inscription as base. Mix these in different proportions <br />you <br />  get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />  The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />  larger rate than the 'classics' as they are derisively called. <br />  The 'classics' are difficult because they are unique life <br />  experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />  Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu <br />  Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc. <br />Each <br />  is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is no <br />  comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary worthiness <br />  of the former is much higher than the later. I consider 'Thyaga <br />  boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than PS for exactly the <br />  same reason.</p>

<p>    hi sirs,</p>
<p>    to anyone who has read kalki's works - the first thing you <br />  realise, <br />    is that you are transported into the respective era. you live the <br />    novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that is <br />  the <br />    foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can do <br />    that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime a <br />    dozen movies released everyday - the fact that ss and ps still <br />  hold <br />    their own.</p>
<p>    the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />    background research that has gone into the historic fiction ( i <br />  dont <br />    think you can straight away classify ps as a romance ...ss to <br />some <br />    extent) - to think of a novel written from the remanents of three <br />    culverts - and to spin a web that had ( and is still is) <br />capturing <br />    the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in these <br />    works.</p>
<p>    lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />    characters or the fictional ones - Kalki's portrayal of each and <br />    every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them is <br />  the <br />    crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />    glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life and <br />    blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown to <br />  be <br />    calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.</p>
<p>    if you poll in this site - how many people picked up ps or ss and <br />    finished it without a break when compared to other works is but <br />    enough proof.</p>

<p>          ------------------------------<br />          To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />          From: mprakas@<br />          Date: Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:32:03 +0000<br />          Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Criticisms on PS</p>
<p>          All</p>
<p>          I was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'. <br />  This <br />      book<br />          takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of <br />  Kanaiyazhi <br />      (1964-<br />          74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.<br />          There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan's <br />    style<br />          of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon. <br />    Apparently<br />          this is his only story. The story is two episodes (Episode <br />  300 <br />      and<br />          301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a <br />  piece <br />    of<br />          the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />          episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking <br />    about <br />      the<br />          literary criticisms levelled at PS.<br />          Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />  by <br />    the<br />          romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my <br />      college<br />          days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).<br />          For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and <br />reading <br />  it<br />          doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are <br />  those <br />      of us<br />          who got interested in their history but I think the <br />  percentage <br />    is<br />          much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point <br />in<br />          looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont <br />  read,<br />          say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to do <br />    that <br />      I<br />          will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read PS <br />for <br />    the<br />          sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the <br />    soul, I<br />          will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.<br />          One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />          thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the <br />  mocking <br />      words<br />          by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />    novel 'Sivagami<br />          ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing <br />    remark<br />          criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />      escapism in<br />          life.</p>
<p>          The point here is not to throw mud on PS. You can simply <br />  call <br />      this<br />          between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I chose <br />  to <br />      call<br />          it PS because this a PS group. My question is this</p>
<p>          What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>Although I have been lurking here for a while, I havent participated directly in the discussions here. Its probably because I have a lot to say as well. The below post by Vijay Kumar has propelled me to take the first step and hopefully time permitting, I look forward to regular contributions.</p>
<p>First of all, I cant read or write Tamil well and I was introduced to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  through the excellent english translation by C.V Karthik Narayanan. I have been reading a lot of English fiction from say my 8th standard till now (Im 40!). I am generally attracted to Historical fiction but my ultimate writing and sense of life will be the works of Ayn Rand. </p>
<p>I studied in a <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education" CBSE</acronym  school and there would not have been more than a page or 2 about the South Indian Kings. It is such a terrible state of affairs that the only Indian kings who ruled kingdoms across the seas is hardly known in present day India. What has caused this? I think we have to take the blame ourselves for it. </p>
<p>Even the great Ashoka who ruled most of India did not rule the Tamil kingdoms.After the British, we just let us be dominated by others mostly due to the absence of good leaders. This continues to this date so much so that a society is completely corrupted.</p>
<p>Is there a hope for revival? Countries and nation states are fluid. Every century throws up new challenges and structures. We have to start by knowing and believing in our ancestry and building credible societies that have pride and dignity.</p>
<p>More later<br />Sandeep<br />"Vijay Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@yahoo.com.sg  wrote: to me, before i read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , the greatest king in india was Asoka, the <br />greatest act an indian king did was kalinga war, his greatest <br />contribution to the kingdom was planting trees... jainism was from <br />distant northindia followed by a few white clad monks wearning face <br />masks, or yearly rituals to a huge naked statue of sravanabelagola, <br />srilanka was a battle torn wilderness ( ok ten years ago i would <br />look forward to the lux soaps n body spray bought by visitors from <br />there)</vj_episteme@yahoo.com.sg></p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  opened my eyes to the greatness that has been forgotten ( or <br />bulldozed) by north indian versions of indian history compulsorily <br />infused into our school history..to dwell deeper and realise the <br />real greatness - lets call it true fame..meikirti. before that south <br />indian kings were shivaji, gemini ganesh, mgr wearing grandeose <br />costumes, buxom queens ...- singing songs around flower beds in the <br />nandavanams/andahpurams, some sword fighting holding the heroine in <br />one hand ( enjoyed it though) - some poor kavalali shouting raja thi <br />raja, raja marthanda...</acronym></p>
<p>to look at tanjore big temple, mahabalipuram in new light - not just <br />taking an occasional visitor on a sightseeing trip - gawking at all <br />the white skins there ` appreciating the stone work"...now a days <br />its more a spiritual feeling, its no longer just stone or a statue. <br />each one has a story to tell.</p>
<p>when you read of the conquests of these kings 1000 years ago and <br />finding proofs of their conquests in far away lands....to be able to <br />administer their vast country, to be just, to be loved by their <br />subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage war across the seas...i <br />can roll back my eyes and hear the battle cries of chozam chozam and <br />payum vengai kodi bearing troops capturing forts in distant lanka, <br />malaysia and indonesia - victoriously proclaiming to the world the <br />greatness of the tamilnadu.</p>
<p>i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya history to be <br />more correctly portrayed in our primary and secondary educational <br />material than just a passing mention. i would love my son ( he is <br />just learning to read and write) to read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and understand the <br />greatness of the land he hails from.</acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  The important question that is being raised again is whether <br />  literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here. <br />  There are those who think literature should serve to lift your <br />soul <br />  and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />  I agree that Kalki's characterizations and narrative style are <br />  exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps <br />to <br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance <br />to <br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from <br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and <br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki's skills as a writer. He has <br />proved <br />  it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />  When I read 'Crime and Punishment' I was able to connect directly <br />  with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it <br />  will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner <br />workings <br />  of your heart to such an extent that you change a little bit <br />inside <br />  having read it. While the joy of reading PS is not questionable, <br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />  This is because PS is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short <br />story. <br />  Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha <br />  wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the <br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-<br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine <br />(who <br />  swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for the <br />  hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a <br />saivite/vaishnavite) <br />  and some inscription as base. Mix these in different proportions <br />you <br />  get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />  The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />  larger rate than the 'classics' as they are derisively called. <br />  The 'classics' are difficult because they are unique life <br />  experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />  Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu <br />  Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc. <br />Each <br />  is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is no <br />  comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary worthiness <br />  of the former is much higher than the later. I consider 'Thyaga <br />  boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than PS for exactly the <br />  same reason.</p>

<p>    hi sirs,</p>
<p>    to anyone who has read kalki's works - the first thing you <br />  realise, <br />    is that you are transported into the respective era. you live <br />the <br />    novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that is <br />  the <br />    foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can do <br />    that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime a <br />    dozen movies released everyday - the fact that ss and ps still <br />  hold <br />    their own.</p>
<p>    the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />    background research that has gone into the historic fiction ( i <br />  dont <br />    think you can straight away classify ps as a romance ...ss to <br />some <br />    extent) - to think of a novel written from the remanents of <br />three <br />    culverts - and to spin a web that had ( and is still is) <br />capturing <br />    the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in these <br />    works.</p>
<p>    lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />    characters or the fictional ones - Kalki's portrayal of each and <br />    every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them is <br />  the <br />    crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />    glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life and <br />    blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown to <br />  be <br />    calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.</p>
<p>    if you poll in this site - how many people picked up ps or ss <br />and <br />    finished it without a break when compared to other works is but <br />    enough proof.</p>

<p>          All</p>
<p>          I was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'. <br />  This <br />      book<br />          takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of <br />  Kanaiyazhi <br />      (1964-<br />          74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.<br />          There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, <br />Sandilyan's <br />    style<br />          of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon. <br />    Apparently<br />          this is his only story. The story is two episodes (Episode <br />  300 <br />      and<br />          301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a <br />  piece <br />    of<br />          the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />          episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking <br />    about <br />      the<br />          literary criticisms levelled at PS.<br />          Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />  by <br />    the<br />          romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during <br />my <br />      college<br />          days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).<br />          For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and <br />reading <br />  it<br />          doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are <br />  those <br />      of us<br />          who got interested in their history but I think the <br />  percentage <br />    is<br />          much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point <br />in<br />          looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont <br />  read,<br />          say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to <br />do <br />    that <br />      I<br />          will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read PS <br />for <br />    the<br />          sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the <br />    soul, I<br />          will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.<br />          One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />          thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the <br />  mocking <br />      words<br />          by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />    novel 'Sivagami<br />          ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing <br />    remark<br />          criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />      escapism in<br />          life.</p>
<p>          The point here is not to throw mud on PS. You can simply <br />  call <br />      this<br />          between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I <br />chose <br />  to <br />      call<br />          it PS because this a PS group. My question is this</p>
<p>          What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?</p>

        <p>to me, before i read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , the greatest king in india was Asoka, the <br />greatest act an indian king did was kalinga war, his greatest <br />contribution to the kingdom was planting trees... jainism was from <br />distant northindia followed by a few white clad monks wearning face <br />masks, or yearly rituals to a huge naked statue of sravanabelagola, <br />srilanka was a battle torn wilderness ( ok ten years ago i would <br />look forward to the lux soaps n body spray bought by visitors from <br />there)</acronym></p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  opened my eyes to the greatness that has been forgotten ( or <br />bulldozed) by north indian versions of indian history compulsorily <br />infused into our school history..to dwell deeper and realise the <br />real greatness - lets call it true fame..meikirti. before that south <br />indian kings were shivaji, gemini ganesh, mgr wearing grandeose <br />costumes, buxom queens ...- singing songs around flower beds in the <br />nandavanams/andahpurams, some sword fighting holding the heroine in <br />one hand ( enjoyed it though) - some poor kavalali shouting raja thi <br />raja, raja marthanda...</acronym></p>
<p>to look at tanjore big temple, mahabalipuram in new light - not just <br />taking an occasional visitor on a sightseeing trip - gawking at all <br />the white skins there ` appreciating the stone work"...now a days <br />its more a spiritual feeling, its no longer just stone or a statue. <br />each one has a story to tell.</p>
<p>when you read of the conquests of these kings 1000 years ago and <br />finding proofs of their conquests in far away lands....to be able to <br />administer their vast country, to be just, to be loved by their <br />subjects, to be ferocious in battle, to wage war across the seas...i <br />can roll back my eyes and hear the battle cries of chozam chozam and <br />payum vengai kodi bearing troops capturing forts in distant lanka, <br />malaysia and indonesia - victoriously proclaiming to the world the <br />greatness of the tamilnadu.</p>
<p>i would give an arm and a leg to have chola/pandya history to be <br />more correctly portrayed in our primary and secondary educational <br />material than just a passing mention. i would love my son ( he is <br />just learning to read and write) to read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and understand the <br />greatness of the land he hails from.</acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  The important question that is being raised again is whether <br />  literature should serve any purpose. The school is divided here. <br />  There are those who think literature should serve to lift your <br />soul <br />  and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />  I agree that Kalki's characterizations and narrative style are <br />  exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps <br />to <br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance <br />to <br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from <br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and <br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki's skills as a writer. He has <br />proved <br />  it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />  When I read 'Crime and Punishment' I was able to connect directly <br />  with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it <br />  will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner <br />workings <br />  of your heart to such an extent that you change a little bit <br />inside <br />  having read it. While the joy of reading PS is not questionable, <br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />  This is because PS is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short <br />story. <br />  Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha <br />  wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the <br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-<br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine <br />(who <br />  swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for the <br />  hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a <br />saivite/vaishnavite) <br />  and some inscription as base. Mix these in different proportions <br />you <br />  get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />  The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />  larger rate than the 'classics' as they are derisively called. <br />  The 'classics' are difficult because they are unique life <br />  experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />  Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu <br />  Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc. <br />Each <br />  is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is no <br />  comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary worthiness <br />  of the former is much higher than the later. I consider 'Thyaga <br />  boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than PS for exactly the <br />  same reason.</p>

<p>    hi sirs,</p>
<p>    to anyone who has read kalki's works - the first thing you <br />  realise, <br />    is that you are transported into the respective era. you live <br />the <br />    novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that is <br />  the <br />    foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can do <br />    that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime a <br />    dozen movies released everyday - the fact that ss and ps still <br />  hold <br />    their own.</p>
<p>    the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />    background research that has gone into the historic fiction ( i <br />  dont <br />    think you can straight away classify ps as a romance ...ss to <br />some <br />    extent) - to think of a novel written from the remanents of <br />three <br />    culverts - and to spin a web that had ( and is still is) <br />capturing <br />    the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in these <br />    works.</p>
<p>    lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />    characters or the fictional ones - Kalki's portrayal of each and <br />    every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them is <br />  the <br />    crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />    glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life and <br />    blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown to <br />  be <br />    calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.</p>
<p>    if you poll in this site - how many people picked up ps or ss <br />and <br />    finished it without a break when compared to other works is but <br />    enough proof.</p>

<p>      One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />    everyone <br />      else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />  inferior <br />      feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated with <br />the <br />      reading itself.</p>
<p>      "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />  clearly. <br />    He <br />      just chose the stories to be published. May be you should be <br />      asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where <br />    this <br />      guy is. And FYI, Asokamithran has written some real good <br />novels <br />      depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />  great <br />      novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing <br />him <br />      actually shows ignorance. </p>
<p>      Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If <br />  you <br />      cannot read past two pages of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai' <br />  or 'Moga <br />      mull', that is understandable but that does not anyway <br />depletes <br />    the <br />      place of that novel in contemperory literature. </p>
<p>      By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS <br />but <br />    has <br />      read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it difficult to <br />  read <br />      even the title page). Thus, 'easier to read' criteria does not <br />    make <br />      anything great or add any literary value. </p>
<p>      Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not <br />hold <br />      good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our <br />      assembly and parliament to see what we get. </p>
<p>      Coming back to Venkatesh's point that we need to define what <br />      literature is, I would think any good literature to record <br />life <br />  as <br />      it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />  Ofcourse, <br />      this is one person's view. What say you?</p>
<p>      The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value <br />of <br />      PS/SS?</p>
<p>      Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />    Asokamithran, <br />      Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.</p>

<p>          The criticism that Kali's writings and historical <br />romances <br />    are <br />      escapist<br />          fares are nothing new. They are age-old. But my point is <br />who <br />    are <br />      guys like<br />          asokamitran to decide on the literary status of a novel. <br />  It's <br />      upto the<br />          readers to decide on this. And talking of Moha Mull, I <br />have <br />      tried to read it<br />          any no of times but was unable to go beyond page two.

          Criticisms on PS        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi<br />literature like costume and cuisine will not have the same effect on <br />different people.</p>
<p>when we encounter literature not to our taste some choose to ignore <br />it and some calling it decandent literature take the law into their <br />hands along with a flaming torch.</p>
<p>the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, the Burning of books <br />and burying of scholars under China's Qin Dynasty, the destruction of <br />Mayan codices by Spanish invaders, and in more recent times the book <br />burnings by the Nazis.</p>
<p>The Ray Bradbury novel Fahrenheit 451 is about a fictional future <br />society that has institutionalized book burning. In Orwell's Nineteen <br />Eighty-Four, the euphemistically-called "memory hole" is used to burn <br />any book or written text which is inconvenient to the regime, and <br />there is mention of "the total destruction of all books published <br />before 1960".</p>

The school is divided here. <br />  There are those who think literature should serve to lift your soul <br />  and others who think it should do nothing of that sort. <br />  I agree that Kalki's characterizations and narrative style are <br />  exemplary. But what is being served is escapist fare which helps to <br />  refocus your thoughts to a fictional world which has no relevance <br />to <br />  the life you live. I am not saying this is bad. This is true from <br />  the Count of Monte Cristo to LOTR to the Harry potter novels of <br />  today. They succeed in lifting you to a world which is magical and <br />  but has little relevance to you or your life.<br />  The question is not about Kalki's skills as a writer. He has proved <br />  it to a large extent and his social commitment is well-known. <br />  When I read 'Crime and Punishment' I was able to connect directly <br />  with the trails of the protoganist and was able to look life as it <br />  will be lived in a vice-ridden world. It affects the inner workings <br />  of your heart to such an extent that you change a little bit inside <br />  having read it. While the joy of reading PS is not questionable, <br />  there is no way it can change the inner workings of the soul. <br />  This is because PS is written primarily as a escapist fare. The <br />  entire story premise is simple and can be written as a short story. <br />  Moreover, the writing is formulaic (I believe Sujatha <br />  wrote 'kanthalur vasanthakumaran kathai' more as a satire on the <br />  workings of Sandilyan/Kalki than as a story). You have a social-<br />  climber hero, a half-mad prince/king, a bit complicated heroine <br />(who <br />  swoons on seeing the hero), a villainess who also falls for the <br />  hero, some medieval comic element(preferably a saivite/vaishnavite) <br />  and some inscription as base. Mix these in different proportions <br />you <br />  get 99% of all the stories in the history novel portfolio. <br />  The formula is the reason why these novels are churned out in a <br />  larger rate than the 'classics' as they are derisively called. <br />  The 'classics' are difficult because they are unique life <br />  experiences and cannot be repeated. Take Asokamithran. <br />  Read 'Pathinettavathu Atchakodu', 'Kanavu <br />  Thozhirchalai', 'Manasarovar', 'Agaya Thamarai', 'Thaneer' etc. <br />Each <br />  is a unique experience and cannot be repeated. While there is no <br />  comparison between Asokamithran and Kalki, the literary worthiness <br />  of the former is much higher than the later. I consider 'Thyaga <br />  boomi' and 'Alai Osai' on a higher plane than PS for exactly the <br />  same reason.</p>

<p>    to anyone who has read kalki's works - the first thing you <br />  realise, <br />    is that you are transported into the respective era. you live the <br />    novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that is <br />  the <br />    foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can do <br />    that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime a <br />    dozen movies released everyday - the fact that ss and ps still <br />  hold <br />    their own.</p>

<p>    if you poll in this site - how many people picked up ps or ss and <br />    finished it without a break when compared to other works is but <br />    enough proof.</p>

<p>      One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />    everyone <br />      else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />  inferior <br />      feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated with <br />the <br />      reading itself.</p>
<p>      "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />  clearly. <br />    He <br />      just chose the stories to be published. May be you should be <br />      asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where <br />    this <br />      guy is. And FYI, Asokamithran has written some real good novels <br />      depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />  great <br />      novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing <br />him <br />      actually shows ignorance. </p>
<p>      Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If <br />  you <br />      cannot read past two pages of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai' <br />  or 'Moga <br />      mull', that is understandable but that does not anyway depletes <br />    the <br />      place of that novel in contemperory literature. </p>
<p>      By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS but <br />    has <br />      read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it difficult to <br />  read <br />      even the title page). Thus, 'easier to read' criteria does not <br />    make <br />      anything great or add any literary value. </p>
<p>      Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not hold <br />      good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our <br />      assembly and parliament to see what we get. </p>
<p>      Coming back to Venkatesh's point that we need to define what <br />      literature is, I would think any good literature to record life <br />  as <br />      it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />  Ofcourse, <br />      this is one person's view. What say you?</p>
<p>      The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value <br />of <br />      PS/SS?</p>
<p>      Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />    Asokamithran, <br />      Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.</p>

<p>        I had the same thing when I read Oru Puliyamarathinn Kadhai. <br />I <br />      have heard<br />        thats the best book ever written. I read three fouth of that <br />    book, <br />      but<br />        couldn't appreciate why it is known as the best book ever <br />    written. <br />      Probably<br />        I am not in the same plane of connoisseurs</p>

<p>          Hi,</p>
<p>          The criticism that Kali's writings and historical romances <br />    are <br />      escapist<br />          fares are nothing new. They are age-old. But my point is <br />who <br />    are <br />      guys like<br />          asokamitran to decide on the literary status of a novel. <br />  It's <br />      upto the<br />          readers to decide on this. And talking of Moha Mull, I have <br />      tried to read it<br />          any no of times but was unable to go beyond page two. What <br />  do <br />      you have to<br />          say about this. All I, and many readers for that matter, <br />  look <br />      forward to is<br />          an interesting story, well-told. Criticisms can go to hell, <br />    for <br />      all I care!</p>

<p>          ------------------------------<br />          To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />          From: mprakas@<br />          Date: Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:32:03 +0000<br />          Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Criticisms on PS</p>
<p>          All</p>
<p>          I was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'. <br />  This <br />      book<br />          takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of <br />  Kanaiyazhi <br />      (1964-<br />          74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.<br />          There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan's <br />    style<br />          of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon. <br />    Apparently<br />          this is his only story. The story is two episodes (Episode <br />  300 <br />      and<br />          301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a <br />  piece <br />    of<br />          the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />          episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking <br />    about <br />      the<br />          literary criticisms levelled at PS.<br />          Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />  by <br />    the<br />          romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my <br />      college<br />          days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).<br />          For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and <br />reading <br />  it<br />          doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are <br />  those <br />      of us<br />          who got interested in their history but I think the <br />  percentage <br />    is<br />          much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point <br />in<br />          looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont <br />  read,<br />          say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to do <br />    that <br />      I<br />          will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read PS <br />for <br />    the<br />          sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the <br />    soul, I<br />          will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.<br />          One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />          thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the <br />  mocking <br />      words<br />          by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />    novel 'Sivagami<br />          ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing <br />    remark<br />          criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />      escapism in<br />          life.</p>
<p>          The point here is not to throw mud on PS. You can simply <br />  call <br />      this<br />          between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I chose <br />  to <br />      call<br />          it PS because this a PS group. My question is this</p>
<p>          What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?</p>

<p>    One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />  everyone <br />    else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />inferior <br />    feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated with the <br />    reading itself.</p>
<p>    "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />clearly. <br />  He <br />    just chose the stories to be published. May be you should be <br />    asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where <br />  this <br />    guy is. And FYI, Asokamithran has written some real good novels <br />    depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />great <br />    novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing him <br />    actually shows ignorance. </p>
<p>    Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If <br />you <br />    cannot read past two pages of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai' <br />or 'Moga <br />    mull', that is understandable but that does not anyway depletes <br />  the <br />    place of that novel in contemperory literature. </p>
<p>    By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS but <br />  has <br />    read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it difficult to <br />read <br />    even the title page). Thus, 'easier to read' criteria does not <br />  make <br />    anything great or add any literary value. </p>
<p>    Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not hold <br />    good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our <br />    assembly and parliament to see what we get. </p>
<p>    Coming back to Venkatesh's point that we need to define what <br />    literature is, I would think any good literature to record life <br />as <br />    it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />Ofcourse, <br />    this is one person's view. What say you?</p>
<p>    The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value of <br />    PS/SS?</p>
<p>    Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />  Asokamithran, <br />    Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.</p>

<p>        All</p>
<p>        I was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'. <br />This <br />    book<br />        takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of <br />Kanaiyazhi <br />    (1964-<br />        74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.<br />        There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan's <br />  style<br />        of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon. <br />  Apparently<br />        this is his only story. The story is two episodes (Episode <br />300 <br />    and<br />        301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a <br />piece <br />  of<br />        the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />        episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking <br />  about <br />    the<br />        literary criticisms levelled at PS.<br />        Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was enamoured <br />by <br />  the<br />        romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my <br />    college<br />        days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).<br />        For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and reading <br />it<br />        doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are <br />those <br />    of us<br />        who got interested in their history but I think the <br />percentage <br />  is<br />        much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point in<br />        looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont <br />read,<br />        say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to do <br />  that <br />    I<br />        will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read PS for <br />  the<br />        sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the <br />  soul, I<br />        will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.<br />        One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />        thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the <br />mocking <br />    words<br />        by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the <br />  novel 'Sivagami<br />        ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing <br />  remark<br />        criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />    escapism in<br />        life.</p>
<p>        The point here is not to throw mud on PS. You can simply <br />call <br />    this<br />        between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I chose <br />to <br />    call<br />        it PS because this a PS group. My question is this</p>
<p>        What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?</p>

And<br />  talking of Moha Mull, I have tried to read it any no<br />  of times but was unable to go beyond page two. What<br />  do you have to say about this. All I, and many<br />  readers for that matter, look forward to is an<br />  interesting story, well-told. Criticisms can go to<br />  hell, for all I care!</p>

<p>  AllI was reading a collection of stories from<br />  'Kanaiyazhi'. This book takes some fine stories from<br />  the first 10 years of Kanaiyazhi (1964-74) and the<br />  selection is by Asokamitran. There is a very funny,<br />  satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan's style of<br />  writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon.<br />  Apparently this is his only story. The story is two<br />  episodes (Episode 300 and 301) of a long running<br />  historical ovel in a weekly and a piece of the<br />  writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of<br />  the episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into<br />  thinking about the literary criticisms levelled at<br />  PS. Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was<br />  enamoured by the romanticness of it, I actually<br />  moved away from it during my college days(I studied<br />  in GCE, Tirunelvely). For what reasons? because it<br />  is a romantic novel and reading it doesnt alter one<br />  thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are those of us<br />  who got interested in their history but I think the<br />  percentage is much lower . But being a romantic<br />  novel, there is no point in looking for things to<br />  improve upon the soul also. I dont read, say, 'Three<br />  musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to do that<br />  I will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you<br />  read PS for the sheer joy or it and if I want to<br />  read to improve upon the soul, I will be reading a<br />  'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'. One book I read<br />  page by page for about a month with lots of thinking<br />  is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the mocking<br />  words by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of<br />  the novel 'Sivagami ammal than sabathathai<br />  niraivetri vittala?' This scathing remark criticizes<br />  romanicism at its extreme and questioning the<br />  escapism in life.The point here is not to throw mud<br />  on PS. You can simply call this between any romantic<br />  novel vs a much realistic one. I chose to call it PS<br />  because this a PS group. My question is thisWhat, if<br />  any, is the literary value of PS/SS?Muthu Prakash R </p>

<blockquote><p>  hi sirs,</p>
<p>  to anyone who has read kalki's works - the first thing you <br />realise, <br />  is that you are transported into the respective era. you live the <br />  novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that is <br />the <br />  foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can do <br />  that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime a <br />  dozen movies released everyday - the fact that ss and ps still <br />hold <br />  their own.</p>
<p>  the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />  background research that has gone into the historic fiction ( i <br />dont <br />  think you can straight away classify ps as a romance ...ss to some <br />  extent) - to think of a novel written from the remanents of three <br />  culverts - and to spin a web that had ( and is still is) capturing <br />  the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in these <br />  works.</p>
<p>  lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />  characters or the fictional ones - Kalki's portrayal of each and <br />  every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them is <br />the <br />  crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />  glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life and <br />  blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown to <br />be <br />  calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.</p>
<p>  if you poll in this site - how many people picked up ps or ss and <br />  finished it without a break when compared to other works is but <br />  enough proof.</p>

<p>    One of the easiest way out to read romantic fare is to dub <br />  everyone <br />    else as connoisseurs/elitist. Probably thats because of a <br />inferior <br />    feeling assciated with it or guilty pleasure associated with the <br />    reading itself.</p>
<p>    "Who is Asokamithran?" - Probably you didnt read my mail <br />clearly. <br />  He <br />    just chose the stories to be published. May be you should be <br />    asking "Who is Nagupoleon?" because no one actually know where <br />  this <br />    guy is. And FYI, Asokamithran has written some real good novels <br />    depicting life as it was lived and is considered one of the <br />great <br />    novelists of our time. Not knowing him is one thing, abusing him <br />    actually shows ignorance. </p>
<p>    Again, I dont want this to degenerate into a personal duel. If <br />you <br />    cannot read past two pages of 'Oru puliyamarathin Kathai' <br />or 'Moga <br />    mull', that is understandable but that does not anyway depletes <br />  the <br />    place of that novel in contemperory literature. </p>
<p>    By that scale, my wife never read past a few episodes in PS but <br />  has <br />    read 'Paradise lost' completely (which I find it difficult to <br />read <br />    even the title page). Thus, 'easier to read' criteria does not <br />  make <br />    anything great or add any literary value. </p>
<p>    Also the argument that it is likes by more people does not hold <br />    good. We elect guys whom most people vote for and look at our <br />    assembly and parliament to see what we get. </p>
<p>    Coming back to Venkatesh's point that we need to define what <br />    literature is, I would think any good literature to record life <br />as <br />    it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. <br />Ofcourse, <br />    this is one person's view. What say you?</p>
<p>    The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value of <br />    PS/SS?</p>
<p>    Do answer the question without going into rage against <br />  Asokamithran, <br />    Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.</p>

<p>this does not undermine the literary genius of thiru vka. but it was <br />not kalki's cup of tea. <br />kalki wanted to write like a common man for the common man.<br />I think the literary value of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  was that it proved that tamil <br />was a language for the common man too.( perhaps his experience in <br />Thiru vika's employ made kalki make the flow as simple as possible)</acronym></p>
<p>I wonder how translators feel when they translate <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  . Could <br />Pavithra share with us how she felt about the language part of it <br />when she took <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  head on.</p>

<p>      All</p>
<p>      I was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'. This <br />  book<br />      takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of Kanaiyazhi <br />  (1964-<br />      74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.<br />      There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan's <br />style<br />      of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon. <br />Apparently<br />      this is his only story. The story is two episodes (Episode 300 <br />  and<br />      301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a piece <br />of<br />      the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />      episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking about <br />  the<br />      literary criticisms levelled at PS.<br />      Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was enamoured by <br />the<br />      romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my <br />  college<br />      days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).<br />      For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and reading it<br />      doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are those <br />  of us<br />      who got interested in their history but I think the percentage <br />is<br />      much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point in<br />      looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont read,<br />      say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to do <br />that <br />  I<br />      will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read PS for the<br />      sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the soul, <br />I<br />      will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.<br />      One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />      thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the mocking <br />  words<br />      by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the novel <br />'Sivagami<br />      ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing remark<br />      criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />  escapism in<br />      life.</p>
<p>      The point here is not to throw mud on PS. You can simply call <br />  this<br />      between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I chose to <br />  call<br />      it PS because this a PS group. My question is this</p>
<p>      What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?</p>

        <p>hi sirs,</p>
<p>to anyone who has read kalki's works - the first thing you realise, <br />is that you are transported into the respective era. you live the <br />novel - the characters appear in life and blood to you. that is the <br />foremost achievement of his works - not too many writers can do <br />that, that too in todays age of multiple tv channels and dime a <br />dozen movies released everyday - the fact that <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  and <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  still hold <br />their own.</acronym></p>
<p>the second most important thing - is the amount of work and <br />background research that has gone into the historic fiction ( i dont <br />think you can straight away classify <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  as a romance ...ss to some <br />extent) - to think of a novel written from the remanents of three <br />culverts - and to spin a web that had ( and is still is) capturing <br />the awe of audiences is proof to the genius behind and in these <br />works.</acronym></p>
<p>lastly, the depth of characterisation - be it the historic <br />characters or the fictional ones - Kalki's portrayal of each and <br />every character - developing a mental sketch of each of them is the <br />crowning glory. no too people are alike, men /women are not <br />glorified into being super humans - they are shown in life and <br />blood, with emotions, temper /tantrums - some women are shown to be <br />calm, while some others are shown as wild spirits.</p>
<p>if you poll in this site - how many people picked up <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  or <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  and <br />finished it without a break when compared to other works is but <br />enough proof.</acronym></p>

<p>Coming back to Venkatesh's point that we need to define what <br />literature is, I would think any good literature to record life as <br />it is lived and should let you think beyond the reading. Ofcourse, <br />this is one person's view. What say you?</p>
<p>The question still holds, What, if any, is the literary value of <br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym /SS?</p>
<p>Do answer the question without going into rage against Asokamithran, <br />Moga Mull, Oru puliyamarathin Kathai etc.</p>

<p>    All</p>
<p>    I was reading a collection of stories from 'Kanaiyazhi'. This <br />book<br />    takes some fine stories from the first 10 years of Kanaiyazhi <br />(1964-<br />    74) and the selection is by Asokamitran.<br />    There is a very funny, satirical take on Kalki, Sandilyan's style<br />    of writing called 'Mazha naatu magudam' by Nagupoleon. Apparently<br />    this is his only story. The story is two episodes (Episode 300 <br />and<br />    301) of a long running historical ovel in a weekly and a piece of<br />    the writers letter apologizing for the late turnover of the<br />    episodes. But it is hilarious and it got me into thinking about <br />the<br />    literary criticisms levelled at PS.<br />    Although when I read PS in eighth standard I was enamoured by the<br />    romanticness of it, I actually moved away from it during my <br />college<br />    days(I studied in GCE, Tirunelvely).<br />    For what reasons? because it is a romantic novel and reading it<br />    doesnt alter one thing in your soul. Ofcourse, there are those <br />of us<br />    who got interested in their history but I think the percentage is<br />    much lower . But being a romantic novel, there is no point in<br />    looking for things to improve upon the soul also. I dont read,<br />    say, 'Three musketeers' to get any insight. If I want to do that <br />I<br />    will be reading a Balzac or Hugo. Similarly, you read PS for the<br />    sheer joy or it and if I want to read to improve upon the soul, I<br />    will be reading a 'Moga mull' or a 'Nizhal mutram'.<br />    One book I read page by page for about a month with lots of<br />    thinking is 'JJ sila kurippugal' I still remember the mocking <br />words<br />    by JJ to the protoganist in the first part of the novel 'Sivagami<br />    ammal than sabathathai niraivetri vittala?' This scathing remark<br />    criticizes romanicism at its extreme and questioning the <br />escapism in<br />    life.</p>
<p>    The point here is not to throw mud on PS. You can simply call <br />this<br />    between any romantic novel vs a much realistic one. I chose to <br />call<br />    it PS because this a PS group. My question is this</p>
<p>    What, if any, is the literary value of PS/SS?</p>

<blockquote><p>  What, if any, is the literary value of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym /SS?</p></acronym></p></blockquote>
<p>Hi Muthu<br />you do raise thought provoking quesions.</p>
<p>I think first you ought to define what a piece of literature is.<br />if only the works of salman rushdie and vikram seth are considered <br />literature what about "twinkle twinkle little star."<br />in fact it is read by more people, remembered longer and has a much <br />more impact on us.{how bad we felt when humpty dumpty couldnt be put <br />together again, or when jack( of jill fame) broke his crown.}<br />in a movie we are shown scenarios visually and thats why either most <br />people like it or most people dont like it.<br />very little left for the movie goer to visualise in his mind.<br />but definitely - a piece of literature will not be judged alike by 2 <br />people. i think it stirs some emotions deep down in the heart for <br />some and it doesnt for others. that would evoke differing reactions <br />and different visualisations.<br />most successful writers like archer have traced that success formula. <br />if you read archers twist in the tale or quiver full of arrows we <br />would definitely see something in common with us. the same formula <br />was used by r.k narayan. a mischievous boy, a nagging wife, etc.</p>
<p>satires are rib tickling. dont we see satires on the most succesful <br />movies ever coming on television. of course we have enjoyed the <br />movies and now enjoy the satires too. its the creativity behind both <br />that appeals to us.</p>
