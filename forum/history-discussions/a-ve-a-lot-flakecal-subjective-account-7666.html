<p>Have you noticed that they are all from the 20th century or early 19th? Indian History goes back to more than 2500 years. Caste system, maybe 1000 years or so, i don't know. This definitely points to some catalyst that wasn'tthere earlier.</p>
<p>"lead by example, address basic needs of people and teach them self respect, less on political acumen although being a very smart person himself he might have used his opponent's weakensses to his advantage."</p>
<p>As Gandhi says, the basic principle of satyagraha is to make the opponent feel guilty of his actions, in essence troubling his conscience. In Imperialistic terminology, conscience is a weakness as it comes in the way of ruthless efficiency. I would like to see Gandhi do sathyagraha against the Nazis.. He would be in a gas chamber before he could drop the salt he had scooped up. </p>
<p>He also led by example, and made sure the public knew it. I don't really know what falls under 'political acumen'. He did what he had to do and he didit in the best way. I'm extremely supportive of him, because compared to other politicians of his age, he had the best mix of strategy and common good.</p>

<p>Walasingham, very well written - although i do not agree that comparison tothe west is what changed some bad customs on our side.<br />The west definitely influenced our social thikers a great deal and we do owe as you rightly say some ways of life to them. But social reform is based on compassion and people waking up to how they treat fellow human beings - not on how another culture treats its people necessarily. Same with Gandhi's leadership - it was based more on time honored principles - lead by example, address basic needs of people and teach them self respect, less on political acumen although being a very smart person himself he might have used his opponent's weakensses to his advantage.</p>
<p>Leading social reformers are Mahakavi Bharathi, EVR, Dayanand Saraswati, Ramakrishna/ Vivekananda, Jyotibha Phule...</p>

<blockquote><p>  Fiction is fiction, it is meant to appeal more to the emotions of the reader than his intellect. If you write a novel where you slander every character in it, will it sell? Even villains, their bad qualities are told, but it is always qualified with glorifications like great intellect and so on. Acharacter has to be impressed upon the reader. It's simply the rule zero of fiction. As for the real character, you gotta figure it out for yourselves, based on your experiences and common sense. It helps if there were some 'honest' historical records. History needs logic like any other science. Asi have mentioned in my earlier mails, there is some paucity of records on our side.</p>
<p>  Just think of RRC. He was a mighty king, with a plenty of power. In PS,? he is shown to have some defects. (Yes, the good qualities crowd out the bad, but that's rule zero. A hero must invoke good thoughts). Do you think such a person<br />  can remain uncorrupted by power? And he lived in a age where there was noone to criticise him.. Even with the current media exposure, our politicians are corrupt. Just imagine the temptations for RRC. No way he can be the guy you read in the novel.</p>
<p>  As for his enemies, all i can say is that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter and vice versa. In a novel, at least the romantic, historical ones, there simply has to be a battle between good and evil, light anddark, black and white, with a host of 'gray' characters thrown in to make life interesting.</p>
<p>  Anyway, you should always start with a clear assumption when you start tolearn. You start from "Gandhi is the father of India" or "Hitler was a baddude" and go from there. You read up more about him, analyse his strengthsand weaknesses and then finally rate him. There is simply no such thing asan absolute saint or an absolute sinner. It takes a mature judgment tempered by experience to classify people. Kids just can't do it. You will find that Gandhi was infinitely better than Hitler and that Hitler was heavily influenced<br />  by his environment. </p>
<p>  Gandhi was a politician, for the record, an extremely smart one too. You can't mobilise a country without some smart Public Relations work, image building, embellishing and so on. A good politician must be able to sell his ideas. He must persuade, not coerce. He must strive for the greater good and Gandhi found better good than most politicians and he deserved every encomium heaped on him. If you still wanna search for the perfect politician, good luck to you. </p>
<p>  The British intended to use western education for their own ends. But ourpeople proved to be apt pupils who grew beyond. I'm absolutely sure that we would be burning widows, marrying children and segregating people if we didn't receive culture shock from the west. Gandhi would have been just another practical, devout, middle class, family man. Same with Raja Ram Mohan Roy and others. They changed because they took in the culture of the west, compared it with ours and decided that our society needed some cleaning up.</p>
<p>  It helped that we had people like William Bentick. No way the reformers could have fought the society under our traditional laws. We had this super weapon called ostracism: Speak against the 'elders' of<br />  your caste and you will die lonely. It is a threat that will cow a Bismarck. You need to compare your state with others to know what your level is. I'm sure you've read about the frog who thought that the well he lived was the universe. Kinathukkul Thavalai. One thing common to all dictators was that they controlled information. </p>
<p>  And while you think about it, can you give me a list of 'home made' social reformers? The guys who tried to eradicate the social evils in India? Notthe Sankarachariar, Appar, Ramanujachariar types. The ones like Luther King, William Wilberforce, Abraham Lincoln and so on. </p>

<p>  The 'average' kind or more down to earth historical narrative would not be palatable to the masses. Considering that Kalki wrote in a magazine (and lived with the revenue!!) it would not be fair to him to criticise his highdegree of romanticism/ idealism.</p>
<p>  We have talked before on the 'unromantic' basis of the PS history - you can find things like Sati (RRC's mother committed sati while nursing a child), AK treating Veerapandiyan like a criminal and glorifying his victory, and the many many battle narratives that today's minds cannot possibly digest..</p>
<p>  To re-imagine PS on this type of crude down to earth basis often will take away the magic of the story that we are used to, and not sure what purpose that would achieve - as long as we remember in the corner of our minds that it was romanticised i think it is ok.</p>

<p>  Have you noticed that they are all from the 20th century or early 19th? Indian History goes back to more than 2500 years. Caste system, maybe 1000 years or so, i don't know. This definitely points to some catalyst that wasn't there earlier.</p>
<p>  "lead by example, address basic needs of people and teach them self respect, less on political acumen although being a very smart person himself he might have used his opponent's weakensses to his advantage."</p>
<p>  As Gandhi says, the basic principle of satyagraha is to make the opponentfeel guilty of his actions, in essence troubling his conscience. In Imperialistic terminology, conscience is a weakness as it comes in the way of ruthless efficiency. I would like to see Gandhi do sathyagraha against the Nazis.. He would be in a gas chamber before he could drop the salt he had scooped up. </p>
<p>  He also led by example, and made sure the public knew it. I don't really know what falls under 'political acumen'. He did what he had to do and he did it in the best way. I'm extremely supportive of him, because compared toother politicians of his age, he had the best mix of strategy and common good.</p>

<p>  Walasingham, very well written - although i do not agree that comparison to the west is what changed some bad customs on our side.<br />  The west definitely influenced our social thikers a great deal and we do owe as you rightly say some ways of life to them. But social reform is based on compassion and people waking up to how they treat fellow human beings - not on how another culture treats its people necessarily. Same with Gandhi's leadership - it was based more on time honored principles - lead by example, address basic needs of people and teach them self respect, less on political acumen although being a very smart person himself he might have used his opponent's weakensses to his advantage.</p>
<p>  Leading social reformers are Mahakavi Bharathi, EVR, Dayanand Saraswati, Ramakrishna/ Vivekananda, Jyotibha Phule...</p>

<p>    Fiction is fiction, it is meant to appeal more to the emotions of the reader than his intellect. If you write a novel where you slander every character in it, will it sell? Even villains, their bad qualities are told, butit is always qualified with glorifications like great intellect and so on.A character has to be impressed upon the reader. It's simply the rule zeroof fiction. As for the real character, you gotta figure it out for yourselves, based on your experiences and common sense. It helps if there were some 'honest' historical records. History needs logic like any other science. As i have mentioned in my earlier mails, there is some paucity of records on our side.</p>
<p>    Just think of RRC. He was a mighty king, with a plenty of power. In PS,? he is shown to have some defects. (Yes, the good qualities crowd out the bad, but that's rule zero. A hero must invoke good thoughts). Do you think such a person<br />    can remain uncorrupted by power? And he lived in a age where there was no one to criticise him.. Even with the current media exposure, our politicians are corrupt. Just imagine the temptations for RRC. No way he can be the guy you read in the novel.</p>
<p>    As for his enemies, all i can say is that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter and vice versa. In a novel, at least the romantic, historical ones, there simply has to be a battle between good and evil, light and dark, black and white, with a host of 'gray' characters thrown in to make life interesting.</p>
<p>    Anyway, you should always start with a clear assumption when you start to learn. You start from "Gandhi is the father of India" or "Hitler was a bad dude" and go from there. You read up more about him, analyse his strengths and weaknesses and then finally rate him. There is simply no such thing as an absolute saint or an absolute sinner. It takes a mature judgment tempered by experience to classify people. Kids just can't do it. You will findthat Gandhi was infinitely better than Hitler and that Hitler was heavily influenced<br />    by his environment. </p>
<p>    Gandhi was a politician, for the record, an extremely smart one too. You can't mobilise a country without some smart Public Relations work, image building, embellishing and so on. A good politician must be able to sell his ideas. He must persuade, not coerce. He must strive for the greater good and Gandhi found better good than most politicians and he deserved every encomium heaped on him. If you still wanna search for the perfect politician,good luck to you. </p>
<p>    The British intended to use western education for their own ends. But our people proved to be apt pupils who grew beyond. I'm absolutely sure thatwe would be burning widows, marrying children and segregating people if wedidn't receive culture shock from the west. Gandhi would have been just another practical, devout, middle class, family man. Same with Raja Ram MohanRoy and others. They changed because they took in the culture of the west,compared it with ours and decided that our society needed some cleaning up.</p>
<p>    It helped that we had people like William Bentick. No way the reformerscould have fought the society under our traditional laws. We had this super weapon called ostracism: Speak against the 'elders' of<br />    your caste and you will die lonely. It is a threat that will cow a Bismarck. You need to compare your state with others to know what your level is. I'm sure you've read about the frog who thought that the well he lived was the universe. Kinathukkul Thavalai. One thing common to all dictators wasthat they controlled information. </p>
<p>    And while you think about it, can you give me a list of 'home made' social reformers? The guys who tried to eradicate the social evils in India? Not the Sankarachariar, Appar, Ramanujachariar types. The ones like Luther King, William Wilberforce, Abraham Lincoln and so on. </p>

<p>    The 'average' kind or more down to earth historical narrative would notbe palatable to the masses. Considering that Kalki wrote in a magazine (and lived with the revenue!!) it would not be fair to him to criticise his high degree of romanticism/ idealism.</p>
<p>    We have talked before on the 'unromantic' basis of the PS history - youcan find things like Sati (RRC's mother committed sati while nursing a child), AK treating Veerapandiyan like a criminal and glorifying his victory, and the many many battle narratives that today's minds cannot possibly digest..</p>
<p>    To re-imagine PS on this type of crude down to earth basis often will take away the magic of the story that we are used to, and not sure what purpose that would achieve - as long as we remember in the corner of our minds that it was romanticised i think it is ok.</p>
