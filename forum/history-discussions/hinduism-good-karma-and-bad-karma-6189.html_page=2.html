        <p>Dear Sampath,</p>
<p>But Markandeya is definitely considered a Chiranjeevi.</p>
<p>So... looks like only my count is wrong, considering the sloka <br />indicated by you. As for "sathyaha" as it could not be Markandeya, <br />it should only mean "Verily".</p>

<p>I was just thinking of this after I read that post from Ravi. I just <br />went back to the discussions that we had on this. </p>
<p>Seems to me now that it could be Namuchi. Honestly I had completely <br />forgotten about this character until Ravi presented. </p>

<p>    In fact, there is an interesting event during the Vaamana-<br />  Trivikrama avatar: Mahabali's son Namuchi confronts the Lord, <br />asking <br />  him how He could deceive Mahabali, taking the form of a small, <br />short <br />  kid while seeking three steps of land, and growing to occupy the <br />  three worlds (and more) while measuring what was offered. <br />Trivikrama <br />  simply throws Namuchi into the sky; and he is considered to be <br />  revolving around the universe even today! </p>
<p>  hi ravi</p>
<p>  thats a very interesting story- have u seen the trivikrama <br />  sculptures in mallai, badami...they show a young boy kneeling at <br />the <br />  feel of the lord ( in mallai its to the lord's right feet)...i <br />have <br />  been searching for who it is....there is also someone shown as <br />  falling from the sky ( ok, brahma is shown as worshipping the <br />  ulifted feet)...just below it you can see someone falling upside <br />  down....some say its trisangu...the lord lifting his feet to the <br />  heavens and trisangu is midway...you can actually see the sun and <br />  moon also depicted half way.....mallai tour members ensure you see <br />  this....</p>
<p>  incidentally in the mahinshasuramardhini panel - also there is <br />  someone shown falling half way ( just under devi's lion)</p>
<p>  there is also a very fit women warrior fighting along with the <br />devi <br />  ( she has 8 bootha ganas apart from that assisting here)...look at <br />  her six pack abdomen...man what cuts...anyone can help to identify <br />  these players...</p>

        <p>Dear Sivaraman,</p>
<p>Please do not be apologetic. If you thought I got offended, I am <br />definitely not. I respect others views very much. The reason I asked <br />you the below question is different. Well, without making you wait <br />let me say what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising the god in any form <br />that one wishes. This is clearly stated by Poigai Azhwar. Am sure <br />there would be enough references with Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>The pAsuram goes like this (I had already quoted this some time back)</p>
<p>thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thanE<br />thamar ugandhadhu eppER maRRappEr - thamar ugandhu<br />evvaNNam imayAdhu sindhitthu irupparE<br />avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm.</p>
<p>Needless to explain this simple Thamizh, but for those who may not <br />know Thamizh, Azhwar says that, In whatever form one visualises Him, <br />He presents Himself in that form. In whatever name one calls Him, He <br />accepts that name. Whichever form, the devotee gets attracted into, <br />He takes that form.</p>
<p>So with that, there is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising Him <br />as a human. </p>
<p>But Vijay added wonderfully to it. Visualising as a Human is just <br />one thing. Only that, in the process, do not forget that He is the <br />Supreme Being and hence do not expect Him behave like some (sorry to <br />say this, but) stupid human. </p>
<p>NammAzhwAr says.....</p>
<p>paRRudai adiyavarkku eLiyavan, piRargaLukku ariya vitthagan.</p>
<p>Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It is <br />called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha visvAsam <br />is the meaning for this "paRRu".</p>
<p>So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely nothing <br />wrong in visualising Him in any form. </p>
<p>Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram or <br />Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran behind <br />it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side dish.</p>
<p>Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum veRRilai, <br />parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one says <br />that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there anything <br />inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences by <br />way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for Him.</p>

<p>    So what would that mean? I mean, what is the better way of<br />    visualising God according to your sister? Answer to this would <br />make<br />    the discussion more interesting.</p>

<p>     Hi,</p>
<p>       Before I write some thing about this episode, can I humbly<br />    request<br />       all of you to come out with your thoughts and expectations of <br />how<br />       you visualise your God to be. I mean the character (GuNas) and<br />    not<br />       whether He needs to sport, Sanku, Chakram, Mazhu, vAL, Golden<br />       Kreetam, etc.</p>
<p>     Once, when I was conversing with my sister regarding a topic<br />    similar<br />     to this, she made this statement, "Visualizing God in Human <br />form is<br />     the highest form of Human arrogance". It really made sense to <br />me.</p>
<p>     regrds,<br />     siva.</p>
<p>       After your answers I will write more.</p>
<p>       Caveat: I am definitely not an authority on the subject. But<br />    would<br />       just like to know the feelings first hand, before I write<br />    anything.</p>

<p>him how He could deceive Mahabali, taking the form of a small, short <br />kid while seeking three steps of land, and growing to occupy the <br />three worlds (and more) while measuring what was offered.

<p>  Dear Sathish,</p>
<p>  Very valid questions. Just my two cents worth regarding the <br />reason, <br />  why Mahabali, inspite of being flawlessly virtuous, was pushed <br />  underground by Vishnu. This is a slightly confusing concept. We <br />need <br />  to see this carefully. </p>
<p>  Caveat: The reasoning that I am giving is based on the philosophy <br />of <br />  Thenkalai Sriaishnavites. I am not imposing my answer on others. <br />  Just an explanation based on one of the various perspectives of <br />the <br />  same happening.</p>
<p>  According to the Thenkalai Srivaishnavites, it is considered that <br />  all the actions are done by God Himself. Well, placing our beliefs <br />  on Karma theory, it will be difficult for many of us to accept <br />this. <br />  I was thinking in the same vein, until, I found a logic in it. (In <br />  fact I had asked that question to all as to how do you expect your <br />  God to be is with this logic in mind. So details of the logic, <br />  later) </p>
<p>  Nammazhwar says, <br />  1. OtthAr mikkArai ilayAya mA mAyan.<br />  2. eedum eduppum il Isan</p>
<p>  and many more such verses confirming that there is none equal to <br />or <br />  above Him. Now who can question someone for an action. Only if <br />that <br />  person is either equal or superior to the person being questioned. <br />  Isnt it? In this case as it is clear that there is none above Him, <br />  then who can question his acts? This aspect is called <br />  the "Parathvam" (meaning : being Supreme to everything and <br />everyone).</p>
<p>  -- Now logically, such a being will always have Unfettered <br />  Independence to act, as there is no one equal to and above Him. <br />  -- Again logically, such a being will be THE Master of the <br />Universe <br />  (the true He-man)<br />  -- When we say He is the Master of the Universe, then He naturally <br />  owns everything. So what we think of as ours, is not our actually, <br />  but His. This is what we say "what did WE bring when we were born, <br />  that we can carry it back when we are gone". </p>
<p>  Now with that prelude about the Philosophy, coming to Mahabali <br />  episode, Vishnu was very much pleased with Mahabali. Mahabali had <br />  all the best qualities in him. But there was a slight arrogance in <br />  him, when he said "I" will give you what ever you want. <br />  That "Ahankaram" was what a small blemish on his part for which <br />  Vishnu wanted to teach him a lesson. Hence He transformed Himself <br />  from a dwarf to limitless height and made Mahabali realise his <br />  fault. That is when Mahabali Surrenders at His feet and asks Him <br />to <br />  clean him (Mahabali) of the blemish of Arrogance. And Vishnu, puts <br />  his Lotus Feet on Mahabali's head and pushes him underground <br />asking <br />  him to be the ruler of Patala until the next Manvantara, when the <br />  Indra's post will be passed on to Mahabali. </p>
<p>  So in short that was not a punishment at all. It was the greatest <br />of <br />  the blessings. Again Thirumangai Azhwar beautifully explains this <br />  episode in his Periya Thirumozhi.</p>
<p>  ilagiya nIL mudi mAvalin than peru vELviyil, mANuruvAi muna nAL<br />  salamoDU mAnilam koNdavan.</p>
<p>  mANuru - the dwarf form<br />  salam - Deceive</p>
<p>  Yes Vishnu, indeed deceives Mahabali into getting the boon. But <br />what <br />  is the deception here. Is it just the fact that He first came as a <br />  dwarf and then while measuring took the largest form? No. Not at <br />  all. The answer is very interesting from a Logical Philosophy <br />point <br />  of view. The deception here is....</p>
<p>  As explained above, while actually, He (Vishnu) is the cause of <br />all <br />  the actions in the world, it means that He made Mahabali think <br />that <br />  the world was his (Mahabali's) while in reality it was His <br />  (Vishnu's). This is what is described as the deception. It is also <br />  said that this quality of Vishnu is very virtuous, in that, He is <br />so <br />  simple (Saulabhyam is the word that is used to describe this <br />  attitude. Saulabhyam -  Sulabhan - very simple).</p>
<p>  So that is the reason, from a Thenkalai Srivaishnvaite <br />philosophical <br />  standpoint, based purely on logic.</p>
<p>  Just remember the song from the film Marupadiyum,...... "nAyagan <br />  mElirundhu nUlinai AttugindrAn, nAmellAm bommai endru nAdagam <br />  kAttugindrAn.." </p>
<p>  and the very famous song in the movie Karnan sung by our dearest <br />  Sirgazhi Govindarajan </p>
<p>  "kaNNanE kAttinan, kaNNanE sAttinAn, kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".. </p>

<p>      The actions of the Mahabharat therefore led to more bad karma, <br />  not<br />    less. And sometimes it is really clueless what God/Krishna was <br />  doing<br />    then. There is one out of the ordinary explanation that I have <br />read<br />    somewhere that analysed Krishna's life and said that he was only<br />    divine in parts - such as while saving Draupadi and while going <br />on <br />  a<br />    mission to stop the war. In others he was human like anyone and <br />  trying<br />    to take advantage of the situation. Of course as Krishna <br />devotees <br />  we<br />    may not find this palatable.</p>
<p>      Malathi</p>
<p>    CHANGING THE SUBJECT to make it more relevant.</p>
<p>    Malathi,</p>
<p>    You are bowling me down every day. can you please enlighten me, <br />on<br />    what basis you say Mahabaratha led to more bad karma than Good? <br />Any<br />    references or its your interpretation? </p>
<p>    When Krishna says, 'Sambavami yuge yuge', how can he lead to <br />  adharma<br />    or bad karma? He says, whenever adharma increases he will come <br />  down to<br />    protect dharma. Duryodhana may be a good king, but still he <br />didnt <br />  keep<br />    up his promise to return the land and did injustice to Pandavas.<br />    Ravana was a sakalakala vallavan. only thing he slipped on is <br />Sita.<br />    Mahabali - still I dont know the reason why he was sent to padala<br />    loka, when he is such a good ruler (due to his good deeds <br />Indira's<br />    simhasanam started shaking and thats why he goes to Vishu for<br />    protection. Am i right?).</p>
<p>    For the terrorist group,say for eg. viduthalai puligal - Dhanu <br />is a<br />    martyr. She is the epitome of sacrifice. Sivarasan was a hero, <br />who <br />  did<br />    great service to them. So police killing Sivarasan, do you term <br />it<br />    adharma or bad karma?</p>
<p>    And Kauravas going to Heaven and Pandavas to hell - if I remember<br />    correct, it was maya created by Krishna to test the pandavas<br />    perseverance, dont remember the story fully, but surely later <br />the <br />  maya<br />    is relaxed and Pandavas goes to heaven and kauravas to hell.</p>
<p>    Trivia - Just yesterday I was reading 'Practical vedanta' by <br />Swami<br />    Vivekanand. What i understand is, there is no mention of Hell in <br />  any<br />    of our vedas. Only Purnas have reference to hell. Puranas, as we <br />  all<br />    know is latter addition, with history mixed with lots of myth and<br />    flavour. Vedas talk only about Heaven and returning to earth <br />after <br />  the<br />    good karma is over, because as per vedas taking birth itself is <br />  the<br />    highest punishment.</p>

<p>  thats a very interesting story- have u seen the trivikrama <br />  sculptures in mallai, badami...they show a young boy kneeling at <br />the <br />  feel of the lord ( in mallai its to the lord's right feet)...i <br />have <br />  been searching for who it is....there is also someone shown as <br />  falling from the sky ( ok, brahma is shown as worshipping the <br />  ulifted feet)...just below it you can see someone falling upside <br />  down....some say its trisangu...the lord lifting his feet to the <br />  heavens and trisangu is midway...you can actually see the sun and <br />  moon also depicted half way.....mallai tour members ensure you see <br />  this....</p>
<p>  incidentally in the mahinshasuramardhini panel - also there is <br />  someone shown falling half way ( just under devi's lion)</p>
<p>  there is also a very fit women warrior fighting along with the <br />devi <br />  ( she has 8 bootha ganas apart from that assisting here)...look at <br />  her six pack abdomen...man what cuts...anyone can help to identify <br />  these players...</p>

<p>Dear Sivaraman,</p>
<p>So what would that mean? I mean, what is the better way of <br />visualising God according to your sister? Answer to this would make <br />the discussion more interesting.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi,</p>
<p>    Before I write some thing about this episode, can I humbly <br />request<br />    all of you to come out with your thoughts and expectations of how<br />    you visualise your God to be. I mean the character (GuNas) and <br />not<br />    whether He needs to sport, Sanku, Chakram, Mazhu, vAL, Golden<br />    Kreetam, etc.</p>
<p>  Once, when I was conversing with my sister regarding a topic <br />similar<br />  to this, she made this statement, "Visualizing God in Human form is<br />  the highest form of Human arrogance". It really made sense to me.</p>
<p>  regrds,<br />  siva.</p>
<p>    After your answers I will write more.</p>
<p>    Caveat: I am definitely not an authority on the subject. But <br />would<br />    just like to know the feelings first hand, before I write <br />anything.</p>

<p>hi ravi</p>
<p>thats a very interesting story- have u seen the trivikrama <br />sculptures in mallai, badami...they show a young boy kneeling at the <br />feel of the lord ( in mallai its to the lord's right feet)...i have <br />been searching for who it is....there is also someone shown as <br />falling from the sky ( ok, brahma is shown as worshipping the <br />ulifted feet)...just below it you can see someone falling upside <br />down....some say its trisangu...the lord lifting his feet to the <br />heavens and trisangu is midway...you can actually see the sun and <br />moon also depicted half way.....mallai tour members ensure you see <br />this....</p>
<p>incidentally in the mahinshasuramardhini panel - also there is <br />someone shown falling half way ( just under devi's lion)</p>
<p>there is also a very fit women warrior fighting along with the devi <br />( she has 8 bootha ganas apart from that assisting here)...look at <br />her six pack abdomen...man what cuts...anyone can help to identify <br />these players...</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Excellent, V Venkatesh, it's good to have an expert explaining the concept in such a lucid way. If only I may add a couple of points here (I know thisthread has moved far away from where it started, but I couldn't resist thetemptation): </p>
<p>Mahabali was the grandson of the great Prahlada. In His Nrisimha Avatar, the Lord blesses not only the Emperor-among-Bhakthas, viz Prahlada, but his successors for seven generations, and promises not to kill any of them. </p>
<p>In fact, there is an interesting event during the Vaamana-Trivikrama avatar: Mahabali's son Namuchi confronts the Lord, asking him how He could deceive Mahabali, taking the form of a small, short kid while seeking three stepsof land, and growing to occupy the three worlds (and more) while measuringwhat was offered. Trivikrama simply throws Namuchi into the sky; and he isconsidered to be revolving around the universe even today! Periazhwar, praises the Lord thus:</p>
<p>ennidhu mAyam? ennappan aRindhilan<br />munnaiya vaNNamE koNDu aLavAyenna<br />mannu namuchiyai vAnil suzhatRiya<br />minnu mudiyanE! acchO acchO<br />vEnkatavANanE! acchO acchO</p>
<p>Periyazhwar's paasurams are.... words fail me - they are to be experienced,and they take you oh-so-close to Balakrishna Himself.  </p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />Ravi</p>
<p>----- Original Message ----<br />From: vinjamoor_venkatesh <vinjamoor_venkatesh@yahoo.com <br />To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />Sent: Thursday, 21 August, 2008 11:26:15 AM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma</vinjamoor_venkatesh@yahoo.com></p>
<p>Dear Sathish,</p>
<p>Very valid questions. Just my two cents worth regarding the reason, <br />why Mahabali, inspite of being flawlessly virtuous, was pushed <br />underground by Vishnu. This is a slightly confusing concept. We need <br />to see this carefully. </p>
<p>Caveat: The reasoning that I am giving is based on the philosophy of <br />Thenkalai Sriaishnavites. I am not imposing my answer on others. <br />Just an explanation based on one of the various perspectives of the <br />same happening.</p>
<p>According to the Thenkalai Srivaishnavites, it is considered that <br />all the actions are done by God Himself. Well, placing our beliefs <br />on Karma theory, it will be difficult for many of us to accept this. <br />I was thinking in the same vein, until, I found a logic in it. (In <br />fact I had asked that question to all as to how do you expect your <br />God to be is with this logic in mind. So details of the logic, <br />later) </p>
<p>Nammazhwar says, <br />1. OtthAr mikkArai ilayAya mA mAyan.<br />2. eedum eduppum il Isan</p>
<p>and many more such verses confirming that there is none equal to or <br />above Him. Now who can question someone for an action. Only if that <br />person is either equal or superior to the person being questioned. <br />Isnt it? In this case as it is clear that there is none above Him, <br />then who can question his acts? This aspect is called <br />the "Parathvam" (meaning : being Supreme to everything and everyone).</p>
<p>-- Now logically, such a being will always have Unfettered <br />Independence to act, as there is no one equal to and above Him. <br />-- Again logically, such a being will be THE Master of the Universe <br />(the true He-man)<br />-- When we say He is the Master of the Universe, then He naturally <br />owns everything. So what we think of as ours, is not our actually, <br />but His. This is what we say "what did WE bring when we were born, <br />that we can carry it back when we are gone". </p>
<p>Now with that prelude about the Philosophy, coming to Mahabali <br />episode, Vishnu was very much pleased with Mahabali. Mahabali had <br />all the best qualities in him. But there was a slight arrogance in <br />him, when he said "I" will give you what ever you want. <br />That "Ahankaram" was what a small blemish on his part for which <br />Vishnu wanted to teach him a lesson. Hence He transformed Himself <br />from a dwarf to limitless height and made Mahabali realise his <br />fault. That is when Mahabali Surrenders at His feet and asks Him to <br />clean him (Mahabali) of the blemish of Arrogance. And Vishnu, puts <br />his Lotus Feet on Mahabali's head and pushes him underground asking <br />him to be the ruler of Patala until the next Manvantara, when the <br />Indra's post will be passed on to Mahabali. </p>
<p>So in short that was not a punishment at all. It was the greatest of <br />the blessings. Again Thirumangai Azhwar beautifully explains this <br />episode in his Periya Thirumozhi.</p>
<p>ilagiya nIL mudi mAvalin than peru vELviyil, mANuruvAi muna nAL<br />salamoDU mAnilam koNdavan.</p>
<p>mANuru - the dwarf form<br />salam - Deceive</p>
<p>Yes Vishnu, indeed deceives Mahabali into getting the boon. But what <br />is the deception here. Is it just the fact that He first came as a <br />dwarf and then while measuring took the largest form? No. Not at <br />all. The answer is very interesting from a Logical Philosophy point <br />of view. The deception here is....</p>
<p>As explained above, while actually, He (Vishnu) is the cause of all <br />the actions in the world, it means that He made Mahabali think that <br />the world was his (Mahabali's) while in reality it was His <br />(Vishnu's). This is what is described as the deception. It is also <br />said that this quality of Vishnu is very virtuous, in that, He is so <br />simple (Saulabhyam is the word that is used to describe this <br />attitude. Saulabhyam -  Sulabhan - very simple).</p>
<p>So that is the reason, from a Thenkalai Srivaishnvaite philosophical <br />standpoint, based purely on logic.</p>
<p>Just remember the song from the film Marupadiyum,...... "nAyagan <br />mElirundhu nUlinai AttugindrAn, nAmellAm bommai endru nAdagam <br />kAttugindrAn.." </p>
<p>and the very famous song in the movie Karnan sung by our dearest <br />Sirgazhi Govindarajan </p>
<p>"kaNNanE kAttinan, kaNNanE sAttinAn, kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".. </p>

<p>  Malathi,</p>
<p>  You are bowling me down every day. can you please enlighten me, on<br />  what basis you say Mahabaratha led to more bad karma than Good? Any<br />  references or its your interpretation? </p>
<p>  When Krishna says, 'Sambavami yuge yuge', how can he lead to <br />adharma<br />  or bad karma? He says, whenever adharma increases he will come <br />down to<br />  protect dharma. Duryodhana may be a good king, but still he didnt <br />keep<br />  up his promise to return the land and did injustice to Pandavas.<br />  Ravana was a sakalakala vallavan. only thing he slipped on is Sita.<br />  Mahabali - still I dont know the reason why he was sent to padala<br />  loka, when he is such a good ruler (due to his good deeds Indira's<br />  simhasanam started shaking and thats why he goes to Vishu for<br />  protection. Am i right?).</p>
<p>  For the terrorist group,say for eg. viduthalai puligal - Dhanu is a<br />  martyr. She is the epitome of sacrifice. Sivarasan was a hero, who <br />did<br />  great service to them. So police killing Sivarasan, do you term it<br />  adharma or bad karma?</p>
<p>  And Kauravas going to Heaven and Pandavas to hell - if I remember<br />  correct, it was maya created by Krishna to test the pandavas<br />  perseverance, dont remember the story fully, but surely later the <br />maya<br />  is relaxed and Pandavas goes to heaven and kauravas to hell.</p>
<p>  Trivia - Just yesterday I was reading 'Practical vedanta' by Swami<br />  Vivekanand. What i understand is, there is no mention of Hell in <br />any<br />  of our vedas. Only Purnas have reference to hell. Puranas, as we <br />all<br />  know is latter addition, with history mixed with lots of myth and<br />  flavour. Vedas talk only about Heaven and returning to earth after <br />the<br />  good karma is over, because as per vedas taking birth itself is <br />the<br />  highest punishment.</p>

          Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Excellent, V Venkatesh, it's good to have an expert explaining the concept in such a lucid way. If only I may add a couple of points here (I know thisthread has moved far away from where it started, but I couldn't resist thetemptation): </p>
<p>Mahabali was the grandson of the great Prahlada. In His Nrisimha Avatar, the Lord blesses not only the Emperor-among-Bhakthas, viz Prahlada, but his successors for seven generations, and promises not to kill any of them. </p>
<p>In fact, there is an interesting event during the Vaamana-Trivikrama avatar: Mahabali's son Namuchi confronts the Lord, asking him how He could deceive Mahabali, taking the form of a small, short kid while seeking three stepsof land, and growing to occupy the three worlds (and more) while measuringwhat was offered. Trivikrama simply throws Namuchi into the sky; and he isconsidered to be revolving around the universe even today! Periazhwar, praises the Lord thus:</p>
<p>ennidhu mAyam? ennappan aRindhilan<br />munnaiya vaNNamE koNDu aLavAyenna<br />mannu namuchiyai vAnil suzhatRiya<br />minnu mudiyanE! acchO acchO<br />vEnkatavANanE! acchO acchO</p>
<p>Periyazhwar's paasurams are.... words fail me - they are to be experienced,and they take you oh-so-close to Balakrishna Himself.  </p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />Ravi</p>
<p>----- Original Message ----<br />From: vinjamoor_venkatesh <vinjamoor_venkatesh@yahoo.com <br />To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />Sent: Thursday, 21 August, 2008 11:26:15 AM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma</vinjamoor_venkatesh@yahoo.com></p>
<p>Dear Sathish,</p>
<p>Very valid questions. Just my two cents worth regarding the reason, <br />why Mahabali, inspite of being flawlessly virtuous, was pushed <br />underground by Vishnu. This is a slightly confusing concept. We need <br />to see this carefully. </p>
<p>Caveat: The reasoning that I am giving is based on the philosophy of <br />Thenkalai Sriaishnavites. I am not imposing my answer on others. <br />Just an explanation based on one of the various perspectives of the <br />same happening.</p>
<p>According to the Thenkalai Srivaishnavites, it is considered that <br />all the actions are done by God Himself. Well, placing our beliefs <br />on Karma theory, it will be difficult for many of us to accept this. <br />I was thinking in the same vein, until, I found a logic in it. (In <br />fact I had asked that question to all as to how do you expect your <br />God to be is with this logic in mind. So details of the logic, <br />later) </p>
<p>Nammazhwar says, <br />1. OtthAr mikkArai ilayAya mA mAyan.<br />2. eedum eduppum il Isan</p>
<p>and many more such verses confirming that there is none equal to or <br />above Him. Now who can question someone for an action. Only if that <br />person is either equal or superior to the person being questioned. <br />Isnt it? In this case as it is clear that there is none above Him, <br />then who can question his acts? This aspect is called <br />the "Parathvam" (meaning : being Supreme to everything and everyone).</p>
<p>-- Now logically, such a being will always have Unfettered <br />Independence to act, as there is no one equal to and above Him. <br />-- Again logically, such a being will be THE Master of the Universe <br />(the true He-man)<br />-- When we say He is the Master of the Universe, then He naturally <br />owns everything. So what we think of as ours, is not our actually, <br />but His. This is what we say "what did WE bring when we were born, <br />that we can carry it back when we are gone". </p>
<p>Now with that prelude about the Philosophy, coming to Mahabali <br />episode, Vishnu was very much pleased with Mahabali. Mahabali had <br />all the best qualities in him. But there was a slight arrogance in <br />him, when he said "I" will give you what ever you want. <br />That "Ahankaram" was what a small blemish on his part for which <br />Vishnu wanted to teach him a lesson. Hence He transformed Himself <br />from a dwarf to limitless height and made Mahabali realise his <br />fault. That is when Mahabali Surrenders at His feet and asks Him to <br />clean him (Mahabali) of the blemish of Arrogance. And Vishnu, puts <br />his Lotus Feet on Mahabali's head and pushes him underground asking <br />him to be the ruler of Patala until the next Manvantara, when the <br />Indra's post will be passed on to Mahabali. </p>
<p>So in short that was not a punishment at all. It was the greatest of <br />the blessings. Again Thirumangai Azhwar beautifully explains this <br />episode in his Periya Thirumozhi.</p>
<p>ilagiya nIL mudi mAvalin than peru vELviyil, mANuruvAi muna nAL<br />salamoDU mAnilam koNdavan.</p>
<p>mANuru - the dwarf form<br />salam - Deceive</p>
<p>Yes Vishnu, indeed deceives Mahabali into getting the boon. But what <br />is the deception here. Is it just the fact that He first came as a <br />dwarf and then while measuring took the largest form? No. Not at <br />all.

        <p>Sivaraman,</p>
<p>In my view that (Visualizing GOD in the form I want to) is the greatness of<br />Hindu religion. I am not against any religion but for me visualising GOD as<br />FATHER / SON / HOLY GHOST is not possible. But I can see him / visualize him<br />in what ever form I want. Be it Macha / Koorma / Narasimha / Vamana / Rama /<br />Balarama / Kali / Durga. That kind of flexibility you don't have in any<br />religion except Hindu religion.</p>

          Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sathish,</p>
<p>Very valid questions. Just my two cents worth regarding the reason, <br />why Mahabali, inspite of being flawlessly virtuous, was pushed <br />underground by Vishnu. This is a slightly confusing concept. We need <br />to see this carefully. </p>
<p>Caveat: The reasoning that I am giving is based on the philosophy of <br />Thenkalai Sriaishnavites. I am not imposing my answer on others. <br />Just an explanation based on one of the various perspectives of the <br />same happening.</p>
<p>According to the Thenkalai Srivaishnavites, it is considered that <br />all the actions are done by God Himself. Well, placing our beliefs <br />on Karma theory, it will be difficult for many of us to accept this. <br />I was thinking in the same vein, until, I found a logic in it. (In <br />fact I had asked that question to all as to how do you expect your <br />God to be is with this logic in mind. So details of the logic, <br />later) </p>
<p>Nammazhwar says, <br />1. OtthAr mikkArai ilayAya mA mAyan.<br />2. eedum eduppum il Isan</p>
<p>and many more such verses confirming that there is none equal to or <br />above Him. Now who can question someone for an action. Only if that <br />person is either equal or superior to the person being questioned. <br />Isnt it? In this case as it is clear that there is none above Him, <br />then who can question his acts? This aspect is called <br />the "Parathvam" (meaning : being Supreme to everything and everyone).</p>
<p>-- Now logically, such a being will always have Unfettered <br />Independence to act, as there is no one equal to and above Him. <br />-- Again logically, such a being will be THE Master of the Universe <br />(the true He-man)<br />-- When we say He is the Master of the Universe, then He naturally <br />owns everything. So what we think of as ours, is not our actually, <br />but His. This is what we say "what did WE bring when we were born, <br />that we can carry it back when we are gone". </p>
<p>Now with that prelude about the Philosophy, coming to Mahabali <br />episode, Vishnu was very much pleased with Mahabali. Mahabali had <br />all the best qualities in him. But there was a slight arrogance in <br />him, when he said "I" will give you what ever you want. <br />That "Ahankaram" was what a small blemish on his part for which <br />Vishnu wanted to teach him a lesson. Hence He transformed Himself <br />from a dwarf to limitless height and made Mahabali realise his <br />fault. That is when Mahabali Surrenders at His feet and asks Him to <br />clean him (Mahabali) of the blemish of Arrogance. And Vishnu, puts <br />his Lotus Feet on Mahabali's head and pushes him underground asking <br />him to be the ruler of Patala until the next Manvantara, when the <br />Indra's post will be passed on to Mahabali. </p>
<p>So in short that was not a punishment at all. It was the greatest of <br />the blessings. Again Thirumangai Azhwar beautifully explains this <br />episode in his Periya Thirumozhi.</p>
<p>ilagiya nIL mudi mAvalin than peru vELviyil, mANuruvAi muna nAL<br />salamoDU mAnilam koNdavan.</p>
<p>mANuru - the dwarf form<br />salam - Deceive</p>
<p>Yes Vishnu, indeed deceives Mahabali into getting the boon. But what <br />is the deception here. Is it just the fact that He first came as a <br />dwarf and then while measuring took the largest form? No. Not at <br />all. The answer is very interesting from a Logical Philosophy point <br />of view. The deception here is....</p>
<p>As explained above, while actually, He (Vishnu) is the cause of all <br />the actions in the world, it means that He made Mahabali think that <br />the world was his (Mahabali's) while in reality it was His <br />(Vishnu's). This is what is described as the deception. It is also <br />said that this quality of Vishnu is very virtuous, in that, He is so <br />simple (Saulabhyam is the word that is used to describe this <br />attitude. Saulabhyam -  Sulabhan - very simple).</p>
<p>So that is the reason, from a Thenkalai Srivaishnvaite philosophical <br />standpoint, based purely on logic.</p>
<p>Just remember the song from the film Marupadiyum,...... "nAyagan <br />mElirundhu nUlinai AttugindrAn, nAmellAm bommai endru nAdagam <br />kAttugindrAn.." </p>
<p>and the very famous song in the movie Karnan sung by our dearest <br />Sirgazhi Govindarajan </p>
<p>"kaNNanE kAttinan, kaNNanE sAttinAn, kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".. </p>

<p>    ?<br />    The actions of the Mahabharat therefore led to more bad karma, <br />not<br />  less. And sometimes it is really clueless what God/Krishna was <br />doing<br />  then. There is one out of the ordinary explanation that I have read<br />  somewhere that analysed Krishna's life and said that he was only<br />  divine in parts - such as while saving Draupadi and while going on <br />a<br />  mission to stop the war. In others he was human like anyone and <br />trying<br />  to take advantage of the situation. Of course as Krishna devotees <br />we<br />  may not find this palatable.<br />    ?<br />    Malathi</p>
<p>  CHANGING THE SUBJECT to make it more relevant.</p>
<p>  Malathi,</p>
<p>  You are bowling me down every day. can you please enlighten me, on<br />  what basis you say Mahabaratha led to more bad karma than Good? Any<br />  references or its your interpretation? </p>
<p>  When Krishna says, 'Sambavami yuge yuge', how can he lead to <br />adharma<br />  or bad karma? He says, whenever adharma increases he will come <br />down to<br />  protect dharma. Duryodhana may be a good king, but still he didnt <br />keep<br />  up his promise to return the land and did injustice to Pandavas.<br />  Ravana was a sakalakala vallavan. only thing he slipped on is Sita.<br />  Mahabali - still I dont know the reason why he was sent to padala<br />  loka, when he is such a good ruler (due to his good deeds Indira's<br />  simhasanam started shaking and thats why he goes to Vishu for<br />  protection. Am i right?).</p>
<p>  For the terrorist group,say for eg. viduthalai puligal - Dhanu is a<br />  martyr. She is the epitome of sacrifice. Sivarasan was a hero, who <br />did<br />  great service to them. So police killing Sivarasan, do you term it<br />  adharma or bad karma?</p>
<p>  And Kauravas going to Heaven and Pandavas to hell - if I remember<br />  correct, it was maya created by Krishna to test the pandavas<br />  perseverance, dont remember the story fully, but surely later the <br />maya<br />  is relaxed and Pandavas goes to heaven and kauravas to hell.</p>
<p>  Trivia - Just yesterday I was reading 'Practical vedanta' by Swami<br />  Vivekanand. What i understand is, there is no mention of Hell in <br />any<br />  of our vedas. Only Purnas have reference to hell. Puranas, as we <br />all<br />  know is latter addition, with history mixed with lots of myth and<br />  flavour. Vedas talk only about Heaven and returning to earth after <br />the<br />  good karma is over, because as per vedas taking birth itself is <br />the<br />  highest punishment.</p>

        <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>we can follow some guideline. Let me attempt a suggestion ::</p>
<p>Like Vaaram oru Aalayam,</p>
<p>certain discussions can be serialised ..</p>
<p>Thevaram :: 001, 002, 003,,,,<br />Divyaprabandam .. 001, 002, 003 ...</p>
<p>like wise this KARMA discussion or similar ones...</p>
<p>as our members normally post nice links on these discussions, we can <br />also get such links ..</p>
<p>Karma + Mahabaratha + Krishna getting mixed up.</p>
<p>See whether we can keep them separated..</p>
<p>And in the whole excercise, we also forget the New members - who <br />joined our Group thinking we are discussing ponniyinselvan ...</p>
<p>Definitely atleast one thread need to be maintained on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  story <br />line ..</acronym></p>
<p>Whether we can put Volume I, Chapter 1 as 101, Chapter 2 as 102, <br />without involving copyright issues..</p>
<p>pls help.</p>

<p>Dear Sundar</p>
<p>Was ashwattama a chiranjeevi then ..... why was he a <br />chiranjeevi...need to brush up, experts may opine. </p>
<p>his foreheard...as he killed the sons of the pandavas and let loose <br />the brahmastra on arjuna's son ....without knowing how to take it <br />back...krishna admonishes him and gives him a long lecture on the <br />fall out of this ( amazing ref that even grasses will not grow for a <br />thousand years .....nuclear holocast....would do well if someone can <br />bring out the exact verse now).....and as a price for offerring a <br />remedy / aka taking it back...he claims the jewel and curses him <br />that the wound will never heal ....and so he is eternally alive with <br />a festering wound....</p>
<p>Here are the eight immortals in Hinduism:</p>
<p>Ashwathama, cursed to immortality and eternal suffering without love <br />from anybody for his role in the murder of the five sons of the <br />Pandavas and his attempted murder of Arjuna's grandson. </p>
<p>Mahabali, righteous demon king who conquered heaven, earth, and the <br />underworld, but was forced to give it back by Vamana. </p>

<p>Hi Malalthi<br />Yudhishtra was punished because he was knowingly part that plot.When Drona's hears about Aswathamma's death, he wanted that to confirm only with Yudishtra becuase he would not go against Dharma. Having anticipated this, Krishna plooted this way and Yudhistra when saying 'hatha' lowered his voice andthe sound of the conch drowned it. Yudhishtra's chariot which always remain an inch or so above the ground, becuase of his virtues, touched the ground?on that?moment of deceit.<br />?<br />Regards<br />Sundar</p>

<p>Sundar, why would Yudhistir be punished for killing Drona? Yudhistir was a very truthful man who refuses to lie that Ashwattama died, even at Krishna's instigation. So Bhima kills an elephant named Aswattama and asks Yudhistir to announce 'Ashwattama hatha kunjaraha' - Krishna resourcefully sounds his conch at the word 'hatha' (elephant) so poor Drona hears 'Aswattama Kunjaraha' , thinks it is his son who died and renounces his arms . It is deceit at its diplomatic best. If anyone has to be punished it is Bhima perhaps not Yudhisthir.<br />?<br />?<br />Ashwattama is furious that his father was killed in this fashion and plots the tent fire. Yes it is an eye for an eye, what else does war instigate?<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>42: </p>
<p>The last chapter of the Mahabharat actually talks about Duryodhana in heaven and the Pandavas in hell paying for their karma......<br />?<br />Hi<br />This is wrongly interpreted. When?Yudhishtra enters heaven, he was shocked to see all the Kauravas there and Pandavas in hell. It was?very brief and in that brief moment he expeienced hell. Then the scene reversed and he found all?the pandavas in heaven. This was the punishment?to Yudhishtrafor the Ashwatama episode where he was forced to suppress the truth to kill Drona.<br />?<br />?<br />?<br />The pandavas actually lose all their progeny except one in the great fire that Dhristhadyumna sets to their tent.<br />?<br />Actually?it was Ashwatama? and gang who sets the tent on fire where allthe Pandava siblings die. <br />?<br />Sundar</p></css_rajan@yahoo.com></p>

        <p>Hi Satish, yes the land was not returned, but again does that warranty sucha bloody war? Yes the count is mind boggling but are we looking at same numbers as our present numeric system? The Ramayana for example says Dasaratha ruled 16,000 years, is it humanly possible? And there is little/no evidence that there was population explosion. In fact both Yudhistir and Duryodhana supposedly ruled over very prosperous kingdoms.<br />?<br />There is another way of looking at this whole thing - from Duryodhana's perspective. My grandmother said there used to be several street plays and folk narratives of the Mahabharat from various perspective that disappeard over time. One of them is like this - Duryodhana was not legally obligated to share any part of his kingdom with the pandavas, since they were not his biwere partial to the pandavas since Pandu died young and the five children were very accomplished. That instigated anger in Duryodhana who in turn grew up to be a vengeful, resentful prince and refuses to see the Pandavas as his equals. <br />?<br />As far as Krishna not wanting the war, Krishna was the chess player in the whole game who moved the dice at will, not a blind follower of what each person did ? That is exactly what Gandhari asks him before cursing him and his tribe. You could have stopped it if you willed so. Why did he not will so?? Perhaps we will never know the answers.<br />?<br />I have attended numerous discourses and talks on the Mahabharat. The late Pulavar Keeran was just amazing. I love the story very much so, am also aware of its pitfalls, [particularly with an increasingly aware generation of youngsters. (My?11 year old niece asked me a question - if Kamsa did not want his sister to have the 8th child why did he not put her and her husbandin separate jails. :)). In our time and age kids did not think that way atall.)<br />?<br />I narrate the Mahabharat as a collection of short stories. It makes huge sense that way. Not as one long story with pandavas as heroes and kauravas asvillians. It does not add up to that and it probably was a lot of differntstories collected over time. ?And the puranas have little/no connection with vedic ways of living or clear cut definitions of karma. <br />?<br />Malathi<br />?</p>

<p>very true. But after loosing the dice game the agreement is that after<br />14 years the land will be returned to the pandavas. Did that happen? </p>
<p>For the amount of bloodshed and the gory war - I happened to talk with<br />Mr.TKS Rajan once on this. Thanks to SPS, he introduced me to Mr.Rajan<br />and got a chance to meet him a couple of times, and once in SPS's<br />office I had a very interesting discussion with Mr.Rajan on Krishna,<br />Mahabaratha etc. Mr Rajan has done detailed research on Krishna and<br />Mahabaratha and his knowledge is amazing. He is closely linked with<br />Media and I think he is with Makkal tv now.</p>
<p>He said - basically it can be viewed as a population control method.<br />The population at that time was enormous. if we calculate the count of<br />the akshouni (correcta?) sena that participated in the war, the count<br />is mind boggling. The soldiers alone might outwit the current<br />population of india.</p>
<p>And moreover, every stalwarts, had their destructive weapons- Karna<br />with Brhamasthiram, Sakthi etc. Arjuna had Pasupathasthram the most<br />destructive etc. etc. Today we evens deduce that those could be nukes.<br />So think of a world with everyone having their own nuke and grumbling<br />for vengeance? Krishna did try hard to avoid the war but it was<br />Dhuryodhana who insisted on war.</p>

<p>willingly participated in the dice game and lost all.Granted some<br />injustice was done but what warrantied that degree of bloodshed? What<br />was the fallout of the war? All of the pandavs children died in the<br />fire. All of yadavas died due to Gandhari&#39; s curse - so Krishna has<br />karma too, right? What exactly was Sri krishna trying to prove with a<br />big war, it baffles me. We can of course do reverse justification, he<br />was God and therefore he knew his reasons which mortals don&#39;t.<br />Perhaps. But sometimes that does feel lame, why couldn&#39;t he have<br />resolved it without blooshed or with less blodshd? I think it is<br />important to ask all these questions even if we don&#39;t know<br />answers. Otherwise our children will or kudharka vaadhis like dk ites<br />will.more later, sorry not enough time.</p>

<p>On the serious note, as SPS mentioned, there is no good or bad karma.<br />its only karma and the attachment we have towards it makes it good or<br />bad. </p>
<p>There is a story in a upanishad, where a butcher enlightens a rishi on<br />Brahman.

The butcher on<br />the other had never feels that he is killing lives, but does it<br />without any attachment as Karma yoga and does his duty without<br />expecting anything, and thus realizes brahman.</p>

        <p>very true. But after loosing the dice game the agreement is that after<br />14 years the land will be returned to the pandavas. Did that happen? </p>
<p>For the amount of bloodshed and the gory war - I happened to talk with<br />Mr.TKS Rajan once on this. Thanks to SPS, he introduced me to Mr.Rajan<br />and got a chance to meet him a couple of times, and once in SPS's<br />office I had a very interesting discussion with Mr.Rajan on Krishna,<br />Mahabaratha etc. Mr Rajan has done detailed research on Krishna and<br />Mahabaratha and his knowledge is amazing. He is closely linked with<br />Media and I think he is with Makkal tv now.</p>
<p>He said - basically it can be viewed as a population control method.<br />The population at that time was enormous. if we calculate the count of<br />the akshouni (correcta?) sena that participated in the war, the count<br />is mind boggling. The soldiers alone might outwit the current<br />population of india.</p>
<p>And moreover, every stalwarts, had their destructive weapons- Karna<br />with Brhamasthiram, Sakthi etc. Arjuna had Pasupathasthram the most<br />destructive etc. etc. Today we evens deduce that those could be nukes.<br />So think of a world with everyone having their own nuke and grumbling<br />for vengeance? Krishna did try hard to avoid the war but it was<br />Dhuryodhana who insisted on war.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

<p>willingly participated in the dice game and lost all.Granted some<br />injustice was done but what warrantied that degree of bloodshed? What<br />was the fallout of the war? All of the pandavs children died in the<br />fire. All of yadavas died due to Gandhari&#39;s curse - so Krishna has<br />karma too, right? What exactly was Sri krishna trying to prove with a<br />big war, it baffles me. We can of course do reverse justification, he<br />was God and therefore he knew his reasons which mortals don&#39;t.<br />Perhaps. But sometimes that does feel lame, why couldn&#39;t he have<br />resolved it without blooshed or with less blodshd? I think it is<br />important to ask all these questions even if we don&#39;t know<br />answers. Otherwise our children will or kudharka vaadhis like dk ites<br />will.more later, sorry not enough time.</p>

<p>   ? <br />   The actions of the Mahabharat therefore led to more bad karma, not <br />  less. And sometimes it is really clueless what God/Krishna was doing <br />  then. There is one out of the ordinary explanation that I have read <br />  somewhere that analysed Krishna's life and said that he was only <br />  divine in parts - such as while saving Draupadi and while going on a <br />  mission to stop the war. In others he was human like anyone and trying <br />  to take advantage of the situation. Of course as Krishna devotees we <br />  may not find this palatable. <br />   ? <br />   Malathi </p>
<p>  CHANGING THE SUBJECT to make it more relevant. <br />  Malathi, <br />  You are bowling me down every day. can you please enlighten me, on <br />  what basis you say Mahabaratha led to more bad karma than Good? Any <br />  references or its your interpretation? <br />  When Krishna says, 'Sambavami yuge yuge', how can he lead to adharma <br />  or bad karma? He says, whenever adharma increases he will come down to <br />  protect dharma. Duryodhana may be a good king, but still he didnt keep <br />  up his promise to return the land and did injustice to Pandavas. <br />  Ravana was a sakalakala vallavan. only thing he slipped on is Sita. <br />  Mahabali - still I dont know the reason why he was sent to padala <br />  loka, when he is such a good ruler (due to his good deeds Indira's <br />  simhasanam started shaking and thats why he goes to Vishu for <br />  protection. Am i right?). <br />  For the terrorist group,say for eg. viduthalai puligal - Dhanu is a <br />  martyr. She is the epitome of sacrifice. Sivarasan was a hero, who did <br />  great service to them. So police killing Sivarasan, do you term it <br />  adharma or bad karma? <br />  And Kauravas going to Heaven and Pandavas to hell - if I remember <br />  correct, it was maya created by Krishna to test the pandavas <br />  perseverance, dont remember the story fully, but surely later the maya <br />  is relaxed and Pandavas goes to heaven and kauravas to hell. <br />  Trivia - Just yesterday I was reading 'Practical vedanta' by Swami <br />  Vivekanand. What i understand is, there is no mention of Hell in any <br />  of our vedas. Only Purnas have reference to hell. Puranas, as we all <br />  know is latter addition, with history mixed with lots of myth and <br />  flavour. Vedas talk only about Heaven and returning to earth after the <br />  good karma is over, because as per vedas taking birth itself is the <br />  highest punishment. <br />  Regards, <br />  Satish </p>
