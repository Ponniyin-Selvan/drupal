        <p>Dear Suganya<br />I agree with you perfectly except one thing...I think Yavanarani was Sandilyans best byfar.</p>
<p>As far Kadalpura it was based on the circumstances which led to the Kalinga war and lead to the creation of Kalingathu parani praising the achievement of Kulothungan and Karunagara thondaimaan by jeyankondar</p>
<p>If you read the Mugavurai by Prof Dr N Subramanian you ll understand its a historic novel and not a karpanai kaaviyam in a different period</p>
<p>Infact he things Kulothunga's name on ascension is an inspiration of the Srivijaya kings who were Vijayothungan...Kumarathungan etc....</p>
<p>There was a mail about Purvadesam recently He thinks Purvadesam is actually Indo China which is present day Vietnam Combodia and Laos.....</p>
<p>So it was a fiction based on a strong historic background</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Rajendran,</p>
<p>Pls dont say that Kadal Pura is a imaginory story. May not be to bits<br />and pieces but it is very much a real story.</p>
<p>Kulothunga Cholan is the famous king in Chola era after <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym .<br />There are lot of evidences in Chinese history that he had a huge Chola<br />army in Southern China after his expeditions to South East and its<br />conquest.</acronym></p>
<p>Also many evidences about him conquering Kadaram during the quarrel<br />between the kings of Kadaram and Sri Vijayam. Infact, it is said that<br />he made the border line between these two kingdoms and made the<br />respective kings to sit on the thrones and monitored them from Souther<br />n China.</p>
<p>Kulothunga's former name is Anabhayan as well. He ascended the Chola<br />throne after ViraRajendran (Rajendra II). He is not the son of<br />ViraRajendran instead nephew of him. </p>
<p>ViraRajendran was also a great warrior but didn't go out of India. U<br />guys might have heard about Virajpet in southern Karnataka, which is<br />nothing but 'VeeraRajendrapattinam' named after his one of his victory<br />with Chalukyas. </p>
<p>Coming back to Kadal Pura.....<br />Always in Sandilyan's story, his hero will be an imaginary character.<br />Kadal Pura is the only exceptional one, in which Karaunakara Illaiya<br />Pallavan is very much a real character. He belonged to some branch of<br />ancient Pallavas (Like Vandhiyathevan in Vaanar Kulam!) who was<br />working as Thalapathi in Chola dynasty.</p>
<p>And the Kalinga war described in the intial part of Kadal Pura is true<br />and not a fictious story. Actually, in the history it is said that <br />many tamilians were imprisoned in Kalinga and Karunaagara Pallavan <br />saved them just by his smart wickedness and not by any war.</p>
<p>I have read all these from "Pandaiya Thamizhar Varalaaru" book by<br />Ve.Chellam.</p>
<p>Kadal Pura is the master piece of Sandilyan...which has lot of<br />historical informations.</p>

<p>Rajendran,</p>
<p>Pls dont say that Kadal Pura is a imaginory story. May not be to bits<br />and pieces but it is very much a real story.</p>
<p>" Yes, bits and peices are real but not whole"<br />Kulothunga Cholan is the famous king in Chola era after <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym .<br />There are lot of evidences in Chinese history that he had a huge Chola<br />army in Southern China after his expeditions to South East and its<br />conquest.</acronym></p>
<p>"Kuloththunga, is the son of RajaRaja Narendhra, Kunthavai and Vimalaadityan's son and Amangai, Second Daugther of The Greatest Rajendhra Chola.But this Kulothungan is Abayan and not Anabaayan. The "kalingaththu Parani" is on Abaya Kulothungan and not on Anabhaayan, Kulothunga Cholan II"</p>
<p>Also many evidences about him conquering Kadaram during the quarrel<br />between the kings of Kadaram and Sri Vijayam. Infact, it is said that<br />he made the border line between these two kingdoms and made the<br />respective kings to sit on the thrones and monitored them from Souther<br />n China.</p>
<p>"Yes Kulothungan Cholan I had been an ambassador to China, for VeeraRaajendhra Cholan, and there are recordings from Sung Dynasty are 'Devakulo', our Kulothungan I, had been to China. But, there is a ambiguity whether that was Abayakulothungan or one of his Ambasdors, because the is says the Kings name as 'Devakulo' from Ti-hua-Chia-lo."</p>
<p>Kulothunga's former name is Anabhayan as well. He ascended the Chola<br />throne after ViraRajendran (Rajendra II). He is not the son of<br />ViraRajendran instead nephew of him. </p>
<p>"But Anabhyan Cholan is Kulothunga II,and not Abhayan who's court was Kambar, Ottakoothar and Sekizhar."</p>
<p>ViraRajendran was also a great warrior but didn't go out of India. U<br />guys might have heard about Virajpet in southern Karnataka, which is<br />nothing but 'VeeraRajendrapattinam' named after his one of his victory<br />with Chalukyas. </p>
<p>" But, Viraraajendhra Cholas time was full so cunfusions. Moreover his Daughter was given in marriage to Vikramaaditya. And there had been occasions that Vikramaditya need to come to Chola country, twice to supress the coup.Once was during Viraraajendhra Chola's period and teh other was just before Abaya Kulothungan took over the Chola samraajya."</p>
<p>Coming back to Kadal Pura.....<br />Always in Sandilyan's story, his hero will be an imaginary character.<br />Kadal Pura is the only exceptional one, in which Karaunakara Illaiya<br />Pallavan is very much a real character. He belonged to some branch of<br />ancient Pallavas (Like Vandhiyathevan in Vaanar Kulam!) who was<br />working as Thalapathi in Chola dynasty.</p>
<p>And the Kalinga war described in the intial part of Kadal Pura is true<br />and not a fictious story. Actually, in the history it is said that <br />many tamilians were imprisoned in Kalinga and Karunaagara Pallavan <br />saved them just by his smart wickedness and not by any war.</p>
<p>I have read all these from "Pandaiya Thamizhar Varalaaru" book by<br />Ve.Chellam.</p>
<p>"All this is agreed"</p>
<p>Kadal Pura is the master piece of Sandilyan...which has lot of historical informations.</p>
<p>"Yes, it has lot of historical information, but Kadal Pura, the ship itself a imaginary character."</p>

Correct me if I am wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>My <acronym title="In my humble opinion" IMHO</acronym  is Aurangazeb did have plans to capture India. he was sent by<br />shajahan to capture the entire south india. But<br />while he was capturing Hyderabad, shajahan was planning to give the<br />throne to the elder brother of Aurangazeb ( who was suppose to be a<br />diplomat than a warrior). Aurangazeb felt betrayed bcos of that<br />decision ( since he was one who was responsible for widening the<br />kingdom). So he stopped his plan and went back to delhi and arrested<br />his father and become the ruler. After that he concentrated on<br />consolidating the existing areas. fortunately none of his sons were<br />efficient to implement his vision ( As Rajendra did for his father).</acronym></p>
<p>Also some respects goes to the great Vijayanagar Kingdom in preventing<br />any invasion from north towards south.</p>

<p>  Hi satish,</p>
<p>  Tamilnadu was indeed occupied by kalapirars in early part of first<br />  millenium but then they became part of tamil culture and have become<br />  one of the important castes in Tamilnadu(mutharayars).So we cannot<br />  call it occupation.</p>
<p>  The only time Tamilnadu was occupied was in 14th century by mohammed<br />  bin thuglaq in 1325(im not sure about the year)earlier malikgafoor<br />  invaded Tamilnadu but he was attacked by pandyas and left without<br />  establishing an empire.Thuqlaq invaded madurai,defeated it and left<br />  it under a governors rule from 1325 to 1365.</p>
<p>  These 40 years were the worst time of tamilnadu.Only sabuvarayars<br />  ruled in kancheepuram.all other parts of tamilnadu were enslaved by<br />  the sultan.Meenakshi amman koil was locked and srirangam ranganathar<br />  began his tediouis journey from srirangam to madhurai to kanyakumari<br />  to kerala to sathyamangalam to melkottai(mysore) to tirupathi.The<br />  idol was carried to all these places to escape from being captured<br />  by sultans since it was made of pure gold(not moolavar,utsavar)</p>
<p>  hundreds of devotees died for it.FInally that idol waited in<br />  tirupathi to be taken to srirangam.Kumara kambana who was the<br />  brother of harihara(harihara founded vijayanagar empire along with<br />  bukka) came to tirupathi.He was old and was considering retiring.But<br />  after seeing the Ranganatha idol he was so moved.He promised to take<br />  it back to srirangam.</p>
<p>  He collected a small army adn finished off sabuvarayas who were then<br />  loyal to madurai sultans.But his army was very small and he couldnt<br />  atatck madurai sultan.But in his dream durga devi came it<br />  seems.Legend says that she told him "you attack.I am on your<br />  side.dont worry about numbers".Kambana started his attack next day.</p>
<p>  The book written by ganga devi named "mathura vijayam" narrates the<br />  war as follows.Kambana carried the ranganatha idol in his head and<br />  declared the ranganatha as his commander in chief.The small army of<br />  20000 marched towards srirangam.Ever village joined him on the way<br />  with youth coming forward with whatever they had as weapons.when<br />  this army reached trichy it swelled into 200,000.It captured it in<br />  no time and started the journey to madurai.on the way villagers<br />  joined kambana in swordes.</p>
<p>  the battle took place in the banks of river madurai.sultan himself<br />  fought in the war with double the army of kambana.Kambana was losing<br />  but he contiunued with the Ranganatha idol in his head.soon hindus<br />  from sultans side joined kambana and war started to change.sultan<br />  was killed in end.Ranganatha idol was reinstated at srirangam after<br />  a 40 year journey.And kambana became the first telugu king of<br />  madurai and tamilnadu,the unified ruler from kanchepuram to kutralam.</p>

<p>    Hi to all,</p>
<p>    Its really great to get so much information from the learned lot.<br />    Thanks a lot to Sri Hari, SPS and others who share their wealth of<br />    knowledge with the group. More such informations will enlighten<br />  the<br />    group members. Thanks a lot for your service rendered.</p>
<p>    While talking about all these, it gives gret pride to think that,<br />  in<br />    the history, Tamil nadu was never been captured by anyone, except<br />  the<br />    europeans. Invasion of Tamil Nadu by the europeans is a different<br />    story of traitors and decevers. Till the mughal rule, Tamil Nadu<br />  was<br />    never been captured by anyone. Ashoka was able to capture the<br />  whole<br />    of India upto Afghanistan,Burma etc. but I think he too could not<br />    enter Tamil Nadu. Later the Mughals till Aurangazeb were able to<br />  come<br />    till Andhra and Karnataka,but could not enter Tamil Nadu. Probably<br />    the geographical location of TN has helped it because only way to<br />    come to the south is to cross the entire stretch of the country<br />    through Andhra and Karnataka. Correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>    Also, I feel that before the europeans, only the cholas were great<br />  in<br />    sea warfare. Because I am not sure how many kings went through the<br />    seas route to capture other lands. But these greatness of the<br />  chola<br />    kings are never brought to the limelight of the history. No one<br />    outside tamil nadu would have heard about the Cholas. worst is<br />  many<br />    of the tamils themselves would not know about these greatness.</p>
<p>    I read somewhere that, the Indian history is not give its due<br />  respect<br />    the world arena.becuase as I said earlier in one of my mails, the<br />    westerners never wanted to appreciate the Indian history and<br />  wanted<br />    to show their supremacy. Alexander is called 'The Great' all over<br />  the<br />    world. But he was almost defeated by an Indian<br />  King 'Purushotaman'.<br />    Thats why Alexander made friendship with him and returned without<br />    further conquering. But this is not highlighted inthe world<br />    History.IF Alexander is called great, then Ashoka should also be<br />    called 'The Great' and RR and RJ sh ould also be called 'The<br />  Great'.<br />    In India alone, Ashoka is called the Great, but even in India RR<br />  and<br />    RJ are not called as the great. This disparity shown by the<br />    northerners towards southerners is heart breaking.</p>
<p>    What can be done to bring such things to the lime light? Why<br />  doesnt<br />    the so called 'Tamil saviours' the DK's and the DMK's talk about<br />    these facts...any inputs from the learned people? Why I am asking<br />  is<br />    I see many wise people experienced in archeology and history<br />  closely<br />    associated with the ASI in this group.</p>

This disparity shown by the<br />    northerners towards southerners is heart breaking.</p>
<p>    What can be done to bring such things to the lime light? Why<br />  doesnt<br />    the so called 'Tamil saviours' the DK's and the DMK's talk about<br />    these facts...any inputs from the learned people? Why I am asking<br />  is<br />    I see many wise people experienced in archeology and history<br />  closely<br />    associated with the ASI in this group.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Telugu kings ruled tamilnadu till 18th century.The last queen was <br />  rani meenakshi.after that it was british</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear priya</p>
<p>That was an excellent narriation. "Thiruvarangan Ula" a masterpiece <br />by sri venugopalan - 4 parts covers the whole story in great detail.<br />But things like the exact no of soldiers which you have quoted is <br />not there in the book I believe. Not sure whether you took it from <br />madhura vijayam. Yes, Kambana did take the idol with him but might <br />not have carried it on his head - it is pretty heavy.</p>
<p>The story of kambana udaiyar does not end here. He continued to <br />reinstall and reinitiate many of the temple worships across <br />tamilnadu. For around 100 years the whole temple worship process had <br />almost been forgotten and many things had to be referred from the <br />elders.(sultans had ordered closure of all temples across the land)</p>
<p>There are several inscriptions of kambana across tamilnadu that <br />speak volumes about his vital contribution.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with this, kambana and the successors of vijayanagar <br />took all care to rebuild temples and sometimes if a specific temple <br />was in highly dilapated state, they moved the stone idols and <br />pillars to a nearby temple. That's why sometimes we find unique <br />combinations and inscriptions in some of the temples. Sarangapany <br />temple, nandhipuram temple..are few examples where this has happened.</p>
<p>I hope you also know that before the actual ranganatha could be <br />installed srirangam people had already started worshipping another <br />idol - we find him in srirangam even today. There is an interesting <br />story as to how it was proved that the idol carried by kambana was <br />infact the original ancient deity of srirangam.</p>

        <p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>That was a splendid thought to say that lets not worry about global <br />acceptance, but feel proud about our own culture and tradition. Hats <br />off sir. I like that spirit. But still as I said and Niranjan ponted <br />out, even our own Indians and tamils of <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education" CBSE</acronym /Matric does not know <br />about the glory.That really pains. But I like to take it up in the <br />positive note as yours.</acronym></p>
<p>Niranjan,<br />I too studied in a Matric school -:). But ofcourse there are <br />exceptions. I agree that students of matric and <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education" CBSE</acronym  do not read <br />about our glory. The problme is with our educational system. When the <br />student cant understand anything, at the early classes the Ancient <br />History is taught. And following the chronological order, the start <br />with the ancient history in the class IV or V and by the time the <br />reach std. 9 and 10, when the student can analyse and understand <br />things, only Mughal India and British India are taught. So at last <br />the student remembers only the mughal India and British India and <br />forget the past glory. It would be better, if the education dept. can <br />change the syllubus as every class reads about everything starting <br />with small capsules in the early classes and eloborating as they rise <br />above. This surely will help students to remember the entire history <br />of India. Again these are not in our hands. -:)</acronym></p>
<p>And Niranjan, we cannot say that during the periods mentioned by <br />Priya, Tamil was in the Dark. Probably if you meant to say Tamil Nadu <br />was in the dark, then i think its correct to some extent. But if you <br />say Tamil itself was in the dark then I deny that.<br />Manickavasar, i think, belongs to 15th century. Kumaraguruparar lived <br />in the 17th century and its said that hearing his discourse on Kamba <br />Ramayanam, TulasiDas got inspired and wrote "Ram Charita Manas" in <br />Hindi.He wrote 'Kandar Kalivenba' at the age of 5. Arunagirinathar's <br />period was around 250 years earlier from now.vallalar Ramalinga <br />adigalar lived a century ago. This is a limited list. There were <br />people in all ages who contributed to Tamil literature. And <br />Barathiyar took it to the masses. Again there is a misconception that <br />Bharatiyars tamil is very easy and anyone who knows tamil can <br />understand his poems. Bharathiyar himself has said that his poems are <br />easy to understand by anyone who has READ Tamil for around 3 years. <br />In those days READING for 3 years means becoming atleast a half <br />scholar(I mean the standards of education and we should realise that <br />our ancient learning methods were hearsay and very tough). Bharatiyar <br />was the last poet to write 'Marabillakiyam' meaning sticking to the <br />grammer of Tamil(Marbu or Yappu). To some extent Bharadidasan follwed <br />him. So Tamil was never in the dark at anytime. Probably,'yes' now.</p>
<p>Priya,<br />Just not now, but even in your earlier mails, I cant stop wondering <br />the abundant Historical Knowledge you possess. Thats really great on <br />your part. How and where did you manage to read all these? Thanks for <br />your information.That was really great.Share more with us Priya.</p>
<p>I have a doubt for quite a long time. Can anyone tell me what are the <br />present countries which our ancient history points to ..like Kadaram, <br />Savakam (I th ink its Java islands) manipallavam etc..in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and other <br />articles I have read about these countries across seas but do not <br />know which country they are. can anyone clarify? </acronym></p>

<p>Saraboji was a late entrant. But i fear/doubt during all these periods Tamil were in dark. I beleive, it was waiting for Barathi the great. If any body who could tell about anyother tamil scholars during the dark period will be great.</p>

<p>  Hi satish,</p>
<p>  Tamilnadu was indeed occupied by kalapirars in early part of first<br />  millenium but then they became part of tamil culture and have become<br />  one of the important castes in Tamilnadu(mutharayars).So we cannot<br />  call it occupation.</p>
<p>  The only time Tamilnadu was occupied was in 14th century by mohammed<br />  bin thuglaq in 1325(im not sure about the year)earlier malikgafoor<br />  invaded Tamilnadu but he was attacked by pandyas and left without<br />  establishing an empire.Thuqlaq invaded madurai,defeated it and left<br />  it under a governors rule from 1325 to 1365.</p>
<p>  These 40 years were the worst time of tamilnadu.Only sabuvarayars<br />  ruled in kancheepuram.all other parts of tamilnadu were enslaved by<br />  the sultan.Meenakshi amman koil was locked and srirangam ranganathar<br />  began his tediouis journey from srirangam to madhurai to kanyakumari<br />  to kerala to sathyamangalam to melkottai(mysore) to tirupathi.The<br />  idol was carried to all these places to escape from being captured<br />  by sultans since it was made of pure gold(not moolavar,utsavar)</p>
<p>  hundreds of devotees died for it.FInally that idol waited in<br />  tirupathi to be taken to srirangam.Kumara kambana who was the<br />  brother of harihara(harihara founded vijayanagar empire along with<br />  bukka) came to tirupathi.He was old and was considering retiring.But<br />  after seeing the Ranganatha idol he was so moved.He promised to take<br />  it back to srirangam.</p>
<p>  He collected a small army adn finished off sabuvarayas who were then<br />  loyal to madurai sultans.But his army was very small and he couldnt<br />  atatck madurai sultan.But in his dream durga devi came it<br />  seems.Legend says that she told him "you attack.I am on your<br />  side.dont worry about numbers".Kambana started his attack next day.</p>
<p>  The book written by ganga devi named "mathura vijayam" narrates the<br />  war as follows.Kambana carried the ranganatha idol in his head and<br />  declared the ranganatha as his commander in chief.The small army of<br />  20000 marched towards srirangam.Ever village joined him on the way<br />  with youth coming forward with whatever they had as weapons.when<br />  this army reached trichy it swelled into 200,000.It captured it in<br />  no time and started the journey to madurai.on the way villagers<br />  joined kambana in swordes.</p>
<p>  the battle took place in the banks of river madurai.sultan himself<br />  fought in the war with double the army of kambana.Kambana was losing<br />  but he contiunued with the Ranganatha idol in his head.soon hindus<br />  from sultans side joined kambana and war started to change.sultan<br />  was killed in end.Ranganatha idol was reinstated at srirangam after<br />  a 40 year journey.And kambana became the first telugu king of<br />  madurai and tamilnadu,the unified ruler from kanchepuram to kutralam.</p>
<p>  Telugu kings ruled tamilnadu till 18th century.The last queen was<br />  rani meenakshi.after that it was british</p>

<p>    Hi to all,</p>
<p>    Its really great to get so much information from the learned lot.<br />    Thanks a lot to Sri Hari, SPS and others who share their wealth of<br />    knowledge with the group. More such informations will enlighten<br />  the<br />    group members. Thanks a lot for your service rendered.</p>
<p>    While talking about all these, it gives gret pride to think that,<br />  in<br />    the history, Tamil nadu was never been captured by anyone, except<br />  the<br />    europeans. Invasion of Tamil Nadu by the europeans is a different<br />    story of traitors and decevers. Till the mughal rule, Tamil Nadu<br />  was<br />    never been captured by anyone. Ashoka was able to capture the<br />  whole<br />    of India upto Afghanistan,Burma etc. but I think he too could not<br />    enter Tamil Nadu. Later the Mughals till Aurangazeb were able to<br />  come<br />    till Andhra and Karnataka,but could not enter Tamil Nadu. Probably<br />    the geographical location of TN has helped it because only way to<br />    come to the south is to cross the entire stretch of the country<br />    through Andhra and Karnataka. Correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>    Also, I feel that before the europeans, only the cholas were great<br />  in<br />    sea warfare. Because I am not sure how many kings went through the<br />    seas route to capture other lands. But these greatness of the<br />  chola<br />    kings are never brought to the limelight of the history. No one<br />    outside tamil nadu would have heard about the Cholas. worst is<br />  many<br />    of the tamils themselves would not know about these greatness.</p>
<p>    I read somewhere that, the Indian history is not give its due<br />  respect<br />    the world arena.becuase as I said earlier in one of my mails, the<br />    westerners never wanted to appreciate the Indian history and<br />  wanted<br />    to show their supremacy. Alexander is called 'The Great' all over<br />  the<br />    world.

But this is not highlighted inthe world<br />    History.IF Alexander is called great, then Ashoka should also be<br />    called 'The Great' and RR and RJ sh ould also be called 'The<br />  Great'.<br />    In India alone, Ashoka is called the Great, but even in India RR<br />  and<br />    RJ are not called as the great. This disparity shown by the<br />    northerners towards southerners is heart breaking.</p>
<p>    What can be done to bring such things to the lime light?

<p>My <acronym title="In my humble opinion" IMHO</acronym  is Aurangazeb did have plans to capture India. he was sent by<br />shajahan to capture the entire south india. But<br />while he was capturing Hyderabad, shajahan was planning to give the<br />throne to the elder brother of Aurangazeb ( who was suppose to be a<br />diplomat than a warrior). Aurangazeb felt betrayed bcos of that<br />decision ( since he was one who was responsible for widening the<br />kingdom). So he stopped his plan and went back to delhi and arrested<br />his father and become the ruler. After that he concentrated on<br />consolidating the existing areas. fortunately none of his sons were<br />efficient to implement his vision ( As Rajendra did for his father).</acronym></p>
<p>Also some respects goes to the great Vijayanagar Kingdom in preventing<br />any invasion from north towards south.</p>

        <p>Wonderful piece. Thanks.<br />However, I think you have missed out on Maratha rule over Thanjai.<br />Shahuji and his successors ruled Thanjai (Sarfoji et al). Even now,<br />the head of the thanjai periya kovil devasthanam is the descendent of<br />the Maratha line isnt it?</p>

<p>  Tamilnadu was indeed occupied by kalapirars in early part of first<br />  millenium but then they became part of tamil culture and have become<br />  one of the important castes in Tamilnadu(mutharayars).So we cannot<br />  call it occupation.</p>
<p>  The only time Tamilnadu was occupied was in 14th century by mohammed<br />  bin thuglaq in 1325(im not sure about the year)earlier malikgafoor<br />  invaded Tamilnadu but he was attacked by pandyas and left without<br />  establishing an empire.Thuqlaq invaded madurai,defeated it and left<br />  it under a governors rule from 1325 to 1365.</p>
<p>  These 40 years were the worst time of tamilnadu.Only sabuvarayars<br />  ruled in kancheepuram.all other parts of tamilnadu were enslaved by<br />  the sultan.Meenakshi amman koil was locked and srirangam ranganathar<br />  began his tediouis journey from srirangam to madhurai to kanyakumari<br />  to kerala to sathyamangalam to melkottai(mysore) to tirupathi.The<br />  idol was carried to all these places to escape from being captured<br />  by sultans since it was made of pure gold(not moolavar,utsavar)</p>
<p>  hundreds of devotees died for it.FInally that idol waited in<br />  tirupathi to be taken to srirangam.Kumara kambana who was the<br />  brother of harihara(harihara founded vijayanagar empire along with<br />  bukka) came to tirupathi.He was old and was considering retiring.But<br />  after seeing the Ranganatha idol he was so moved.He promised to take<br />  it back to srirangam.</p>
<p>  He collected a small army adn finished off sabuvarayas who were then<br />  loyal to madurai sultans.But his army was very small and he couldnt<br />  atatck madurai sultan.But in his dream durga devi came it<br />  seems.Legend says that she told him "you attack.I am on your<br />  side.dont worry about numbers".Kambana started his attack next day.</p>
<p>  The book written by ganga devi named "mathura vijayam" narrates the<br />  war as follows.Kambana carried the ranganatha idol in his head and<br />  declared the ranganatha as his commander in chief.The small army of<br />  20000 marched towards srirangam.Ever village joined him on the way<br />  with youth coming forward with whatever they had as weapons.when<br />  this army reached trichy it swelled into 200,000.It captured it in<br />  no time and started the journey to madurai.on the way villagers<br />  joined kambana in swordes.</p>
<p>  the battle took place in the banks of river madurai.sultan himself<br />  fought in the war with double the army of kambana.Kambana was losing<br />  but he contiunued with the Ranganatha idol in his head.soon hindus<br />  from sultans side joined kambana and war started to change.sultan<br />  was killed in end.Ranganatha idol was reinstated at srirangam after<br />  a 40 year journey.And kambana became the first telugu king of<br />  madurai and tamilnadu,the unified ruler from kanchepuram to kutralam.</p>

<p>    While talking about all these, it gives gret pride to think that,<br />  in<br />    the history, Tamil nadu was never been captured by anyone, except<br />  the<br />    europeans. Invasion of Tamil Nadu by the europeans is a different<br />    story of traitors and decevers. Till the mughal rule, Tamil Nadu<br />  was<br />    never been captured by anyone. Ashoka was able to capture the<br />  whole<br />    of India upto Afghanistan,Burma etc. but I think he too could not<br />    enter Tamil Nadu.

Correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>    Also, I feel that before the europeans, only the cholas were great<br />  in<br />    sea warfare. Because I am not sure how many kings went through the<br />    seas route to capture other lands. But these greatness of the<br />  chola<br />    kings are never brought to the limelight of the history. No one<br />    outside tamil nadu would have heard about the Cholas. worst is<br />  many<br />    of the tamils themselves would not know about these greatness.</p>
<p>    I read somewhere that, the Indian history is not give its due<br />  respect<br />    the world arena.becuase as I said earlier in one of my mails, the<br />    westerners never wanted to appreciate the Indian history and<br />  wanted<br />    to show their supremacy. Alexander is called 'The Great' all over<br />  the<br />    world. But he was almost defeated by an Indian<br />  King 'Purushotaman'.<br />    Thats why Alexander made friendship with him and returned without<br />    further conquering.

But these greatness of the <br />chola <br />  kings are never brought to the limelight of the history. No one <br />  outside tamil nadu would have heard about the Cholas. worst is <br />many <br />  of the tamils themselves would not know about these greatness.</p>
<p>  I read somewhere that, the Indian history is not give its due <br />respect <br />  the world arena.becuase as I said earlier in one of my mails, the <br />  westerners never wanted to appreciate the Indian history and <br />wanted <br />  to show their supremacy. Alexander is called 'The Great' all over <br />the <br />  world. But he was almost defeated by an Indian <br />King 'Purushotaman'. <br />  Thats why Alexander made friendship with him and returned without <br />  further conquering. But this is not highlighted inthe world <br />  History.IF Alexander is called great, then Ashoka should also be <br />  called 'The Great' and RR and RJ sh ould also be called 'The <br />Great'. <br />  In India alone, Ashoka is called the Great, but even in India RR <br />and <br />  RJ are not called as the great. This disparity shown by the <br />  northerners towards southerners is heart breaking. </p>
<p>  What can be done to bring such things to the lime light? Why <br />doesnt <br />  the so called 'Tamil saviours' the DK's and the DMK's talk about <br />  these facts...any inputs from the learned people? Why I am asking <br />is <br />  I see many wise people experienced in archeology and history <br />closely <br />  associated with the ASI in this group. </p>

        <p>Hi to all,</p>
<p>Its really great to get so much information from the learned lot. <br />Thanks a lot to Sri Hari, SPS and others who share their wealth of <br />knowledge with the group. More such informations will enlighten the <br />group members. Thanks a lot for your service rendered.</p>
<p>While talking about all these, it gives gret pride to think that, in <br />the history, Tamil nadu was never been captured by anyone, except the <br />europeans. Invasion of Tamil Nadu by the europeans is a different <br />story of traitors and decevers. Till the mughal rule, Tamil Nadu was <br />never been captured by anyone. Ashoka was able to capture the whole <br />of India upto Afghanistan,Burma etc. but I think he too could not <br />enter Tamil Nadu. Later the Mughals till Aurangazeb were able to come <br />till Andhra and Karnataka,but could not enter Tamil Nadu. Probably <br />the geographical location of TN has helped it because only way to <br />come to the south is to cross the entire stretch of the country <br />through Andhra and Karnataka. Correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Also, I feel that before the europeans, only the cholas were great in <br />sea warfare. Because I am not sure how many kings went through the <br />seas route to capture other lands. But these greatness of the chola <br />kings are never brought to the limelight of the history.

<p>"Saanthimaaththivu" - I tried to identify same from various original <br />historical sources, but failed in my efforts. Continuing with my <br />further efforts to locate same. </p>
<p>As mentioned by you - ...People have been saying like "yet another <br />island in arabian sea".... -, we have to look for same in that <br />direction. The next closest to the Maldive Islands in the west is <br />Seycelles Islands. But we still have no positive evidence to say <br />anything on same.</p>

        <p>On Poorva Dedam...</p>
<p>In "Kadal Pura" of Saandilyan's.. After, the great Karunaakara Thondaimaan entered the heart of Kaanchana Devi. There is a dialogue between Karunaakaran, Kaanchana Devi and Gunavarman, the so said king of Sri Vijaya Saamraajaya.</p>
<p>There comes a discussion on reasons why Sri Vijaya is called Swarnabhumi, Poorva desam...etc..</p>
<p>I don't remember the exact words as I am out of my city now. I am sorry.</p>
<p>Relating it to Rajendhra's Kadaaram conquest, this might be true. As Rajendhra's intentions was to gain victory until Ganges. He might not have crossed it.</p>
<p>But, as Kadal Pura, itself a imagionary story. I doubt its validity.</p>
<p>On Mauryas expenditions..</p>
<p>It seems during the times of Bindhusaara, th son of Great Chandragupta Maurya, there was a great famine and our Chera, Chola,Pandya..gave them the food and refused to get anything in return. And hence it was promised that they will not invade Tamizh Naadu.</p>
<p>But, I have also read, I dont remember the book name, that all the three great kings of Tamil Naadu, joined together, to check Ashoka's invasions.</p>
