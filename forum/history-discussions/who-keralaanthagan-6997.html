</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Members,</p>
<p>I have a question. The so-called 'Keralaanthagan' - who was defeated by Rajaraja Cholan - was he a Chera King? The entire Kerala of those days belonged to Chera right? or was there a small portion of the region that belonged to a different kingdom which wasnt of Chola, Chera or Pandya mixture?</p>
<p>Yesterday there was an argument with my collegue who said that 'Kerala was not invaded by any north indian invasion'. I said that 'Yes,but the entire south India was under the control of the Moovendhars and Kerala was nothingbut Chera Nadu. That's why nobody could enter. But he said that some part of Kerala was a seperate kingdom. </p>
<p>I would like to know if he is correct?</p>
<p>Expecting your reply.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Shriram</p>

<p>A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY ON MEDIEVAL CHOLAS<br />AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE CHERAS {KERALAS} OF THE CONTEMPORARY<br />PERIOD {A.D.801 - A.D 1120}</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>During the periods of the nineth and the tenth centuries, the Chera<br />country was ruled by three principal royal dynasties known as the<br />Ayes, Venads and Kulasekaras from three distinctive regions of Kerala<br />(the Sanskritised version of Chera), and the kings of these three<br />dynasties and the other Chieftains ruling small regions of rest of<br />the Kerala, all were generally referred to as the Cheras or Keralas<br />by the people of Chola &amp; Pandiya countries of this period.</p>
<p>The Aye dynasty were ruling a region covering from the present<br />Nagerkoil of Tamil Nadu the southern end of the Aye kingdom, upwards<br />into Kerala to the present Anjuthengu in the north of the present<br />Thiruvananthapuram, and was known as Aye Nadu. Their capital was at<br />Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye Nadu<br />also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic studies<br />acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was located deep<br />south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to Nagerkoil the<br />southern end of the Aye kingdom.</p>
<p>The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu covering a<br />region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as Kollam<br />Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport city on<br />the west Kerala.</p>
<p>The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond Kottayam<br />further north upto and around the present region of Kolikkodu<br />(Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital at<br />Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as Makothai, and<br />a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu country of<br />that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil Nadu,<br />bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under their<br />rule during this period.</p>
<p>Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory ruled by<br />Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" under<br />different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who accepted<br />the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their respective<br />regions as subordinates to them.</p>
<p>The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya Chola</p>
<p>Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a powerful<br />Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in<br />Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country covering the length of the Kolli -<br />Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his capital<br />at Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur (the<br />Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the Pandiya<br />country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably during<br />this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the Kulasekara<br />dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to rule over<br />this region.</p>
<p>Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as an<br />incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of this period<br />referred to him as Kulasekara Perumal in reverence.</p>
<p>He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in Cholanadu, and<br />Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, and has<br />composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu named<br />as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda Mala". He<br />abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was venerated as<br />one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the<br />Kulasekara Alvar.</p>
<p>The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. With<br />the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son Rajasekaran<br />{A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was also known<br />by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an ardent<br />devotee of God Siva.</p>
<p>Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram spent<br />most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at the<br />Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) in the<br />Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great Tamil Saiva<br />Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a pilgrimage to<br />the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera king<br />Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva Saint,<br />also went to Thiruvarur at this same time.</p>
<p>Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera king<br />composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as "Mummanikkovai". From<br />there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar to the<br />Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other Siva<br />Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further hyms in<br />Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponnvanna Anthathi"<br />and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and venerated<br />as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by him have<br />been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a<br />collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by various<br />Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala State).</p>
<p>Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar the<br />Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the palace of<br />this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the Chera<br />country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam<br />(Udagai) region of TamilNadu.</p>
<p>While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar died.<br />Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the<br />Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in the<br />same year.</p>
<p>It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and partly<br />during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great Saiva<br />Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who founded<br />the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala.</p>
<p>It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal from<br />Venad in the Chera country though not classified under the sixty-<br />three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by him<br />named `Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola country,<br />has been included in the nineth Thirumurai. It appears the Venattu<br />Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the<br />Sundaramurthi Nayanar.</p>
<p>The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was followed<br />by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma Kulasekaran (alias<br />Ko-Kandan) (A.D.844 - 885) on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram.<br />Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had a daughter by<br />the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva from another<br />Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala.</p>
<p>It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, the Chola<br />dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in partial or<br />total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for nearly six<br />centuries.</p>
<p>Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}</p>
<p>The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into prominance<br />was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}, who ruled the Chola<br />country from Thanjavur.</p>
<p>It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very friendly<br />relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his daughter<br />both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good relations<br />that existed with the Chola country, had made their endowments to the<br />Siva temples in the Chola country</p>
<p>In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu Ravi<br />also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravarti Kulasekaradeva, the<br />villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named Satanur in<br />the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as Tiruayanisuramudaiya<br />Nayanar.</p>
<p>The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the temple of<br />Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) in the<br />year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu Ravi also<br />gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in<br />Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870.</p>
<p>Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907}</p>
<p>In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his son<br />Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, who was<br />a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of his rule<br />the Athitha Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the Chera king<br />Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king.</p>
<p>A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was greatly<br />instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was rewarded<br />jointly by the Chola &amp; Chera kings with a crown, palace, elephants,<br />royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan Thamil Verl".</p>
<p>Towards the middle of Athitha Chola's rule the Chera king Sthani Ravi<br />died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara{A.D.885-917} on the<br />Chera throne.</p>
<p>During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan (A.D.860-<br />905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to them was<br />born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920).</p>
<p>Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907-953}</p>
<p>Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-953)<br />on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan Adigal<br />daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. He also<br />married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the present<br />Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a further<br />queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of the Venad<br />King of the Chera country, who refer themselves as "Villavar'.</p>
<p>Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named<br />Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a younger son<br />by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan.</p>
<p>A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named Velankumaran<br />was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the Prince<br />Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu.</p>
<p>Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the Pandiyanadu waged<br />war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera king Rama<br />Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha.</p>
<p>Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the<br />assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with Paranthaha and<br />his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma at<br />Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in Sri<br />Lanka.</p>
<p>As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri Lankan<br />king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, returned to the<br />Chera Country of his mother.</p>
<p>The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the foremost among<br />the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara dynasty,<br />paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween these two<br />countries to increase many folds. During this period there seems to<br />have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola<br />country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king.</p>
<p>The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the queen of<br />Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for lighting<br />lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year A.D.923.</p>
<p>In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-arisilar Kumaran a native of the<br />Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala country<br />gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in<br />Kudumiyam\nmalai in Cholanadu</p>
<p>In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of Malainadu<br />gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in Cholanadu.</p>
<p>In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold for<br />lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in Thanjavur.</p>
<p>She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named<br />Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During her time<br />a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present Pondicherry)<br />and named after her as Kokkilanadi-pereri in Chola country.</p>
<p>There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala Kurumban<br />given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha Chola with the<br />title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts to the the<br />temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927.</p>
<p>In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king<br />Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier Chera king<br />Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for lighting<br />lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in Thondainadu<br />which was under Chola rule.</p>
<p>Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu<br />(Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated a lamp<br />to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince<br />Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone temple to<br />Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at Thirumalpuram in<br />Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of Kodungolur<br />(Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948.</p>
<p>Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the<br />presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur A.D.952</p>
<p>Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama Varma, the<br />king Kothai Ravi Varma{A.D.917-947} succeeded on the Chera throne at<br />Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country.</p>
<p>After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by<br />Indukotha Varma{A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957}</p>
<p>After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola (A.D..950-<br />957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with<br />Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king his<br />thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious life,<br />and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil known<br />as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the nineth<br />Thirumurai.)</p>
<p>Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957}</p>
<p>He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded to the<br />Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king the<br />Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar.</p>
<p>Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970}</p>
<p>With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the Sundera Chola<br />ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the Malaiyaman<br />king of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar<br />Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias Thiribhuvanamatheviyar and<br />also Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and to the<br />former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1.</p>
<p>During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was succeeded by<br />Bhaskara Ravi Varma -1{A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. Baskara Ravi<br />Varma - 2{A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted Bhakara Ravi Varma ?<br />1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which stretched from the present<br />Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region encompassing the Kudamalainadu,<br />Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-regent probably from Uthahai in the<br />Kongu region which was under the Chera rule during this period.</p>
<p>Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985}</p>
<p>After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 was the<br />legitimate heir to the Chola throne, but he whole heartedly gave way<br />to Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola being<br />his paternal uncle to rule for some period.</p>
<p>Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named Panchavanmatheviyar who<br />was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar known as Kandan<br />Sundera Cholan.</p>
<p>Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014}</p>
<p>Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by the heir<br />apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D.985-1014} on the Chola throne.</p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman king of<br />Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was also as<br />Thiribhuvanamadevi.</p>
<p>One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi the daughter of the king<br />of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a queen known as<br />Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west of Thirutchirappalli<br />bordering Kerala state. It was to this Vanavanmadevi the greatest<br />emperor in the Chola history namely the Rajendra Chola ? 1 was born.</p>
<p>With the accession of Rajaraja Chola-1 on the Chola throne and with<br />his imperialistic ambitions over South India, found that it was<br />necessary initially to overcome the powerfull Cheras.</p>
<p>During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the Aye<br />dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a<br />military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur Salai<br />which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced great<br />trained warriors.</p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines of<br />these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera(Kerala)<br />country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an<br />absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern region of<br />the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull kings.</p>
<p>Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again<br />in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military<br />acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the<br />year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military<br />acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of<br />Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of Vilignam.</p>
<p>The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The Rajaraja<br />Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village called<br />Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants in the<br />year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi (October/November)<br />a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the God at<br />the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river and a<br />perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p>
<p>He now turned his attention on his conquest of the territories in the<br />Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the present<br />Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja-1 thereafter sent an ambassador to the<br />co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of Mahodai ruling from<br />Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as Udagai), namely Baskara<br />Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the family of Kulasekaras,<br />requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty and to pay tributes.</p>
<p>The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of Uthahai<br />and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja Chola-1 who<br />sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year A.D.1014<br />which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears Baskara<br />Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu was controlled by Cholas.</p>
<p>The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the north and<br />central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara Ravivarman<br />Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the<br />Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram<br />(Kodungolur). It appears Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 too accepted the<br />Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in the<br />Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the territories of<br />Chera country ruled by the other chieftans which were under Baskara<br />Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy.</p>
<p>The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory (Kolladesam)<br />and captured the the region along with its seaport capital the Kollam<br />(proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain Govardhana<br />Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the<br />Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu.</p>
<p>Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044}</p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was succeeeded by<br />his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a co-<br />regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012.</p>
<p>During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year A.D.1019, with<br />the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 of<br />Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his second<br />son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who defeated<br />the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital Mahothai<br />and secured his crown, diadem and an island called Santhimathivu<br />belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic sea. In this war<br />Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death.</p>
<p>With the his securing of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? 1<br />assumed the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 gave the<br />title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and appointed<br />him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu of the<br />Kerala country.</p>
<p>However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war expedition<br />with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera country<br />in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera Keralan<br />{A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule on accepting the<br />Chola suzerainty.</p>
<p>Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and his<br />father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at Jayamaliswarem<br />in A.D.1023 and built a Salai for providing food named as Chola-<br />Keralan Chalai and for revenue for its expenses gifted a village<br />named Chola-Kerala Nallur.</p>
<p>Rajendra Chola ? 1 in memory of his mother after her death made a<br />statue of herself and installed at the temple known as Sembianmathevi<br />at Nagapattinam and made arrangements for its worship. In Sri Lanka<br />too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a temple by the name<br />Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory.</p>
<p>Rajendra Chila ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi daughter of<br />the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name Vananvanmadevi<br />daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur.</p>
<p>Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as<br />Gangaikondasolapuram west of present Chidambaram and there he built<br />his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" commemorating<br />his victory over Kerala kings.</p>
<p>Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054}</p>
<p>With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest son the<br />Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-regent of<br />Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. When he<br />ascended the throne among the countries that were still under the<br />Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country.</p>
<p>During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty at<br />Mahodai and of Venadu were agitating to get their freedom.<br />Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which first<br />proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera Keralan<br />in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant Atthivaranam.</p>
<p>He appointed Rajasimhan{1028-1043} the son of Vira Kerala as the<br />Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who continued<br />to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had friendly<br />relations with them for some time.</p>
<p>This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami Temple at<br />Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli pandiya was built by the Chera king<br />Rajasimha, but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. Rajendra<br />Chola too has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042</p>
<p>Further in the 14th year of the Sunder Chola Pandiya devar at Mannar<br />Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of the Chera<br />king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra Chola<br />Vinnagar Alvar.</p>
<p>Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started agitating<br />for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda Muvar of the<br />region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an expedition to<br />Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from his kingdom to<br />the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and Rajadhiraja's forces<br />further destroyed the military acadamy and arms centre that became<br />active again at Kanthalur Sala,i and attacked and defeated Vilignam<br />which revived its efforts under Aye kings to become independent, and<br />was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam.</p>
<p>However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule accepting the<br />suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. Rajasimha was<br />followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082} on the Chera throne.</p>
<p>Period of Rajendra Chola ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063}</p>
<p>In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle field at<br />Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2{A.D.1051-<br />1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from A.D.1051,<br />crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and continued<br />with the war with success to Cholas.</p>
<p>During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola Keralan<br />in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the same title<br />as Chola Keralan.</p>
<p>Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1063-1070}</p>
<p>With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063-1070} was<br />crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending the<br />Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram started<br />agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. Virarajendra first<br />sent an expedition to Venad and killed the younger brother of the<br />Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king himself escaped from his<br />country.</p>
<p>Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara Ravi ? 2,<br />it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war expedition<br />to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai and<br />Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. The<br />Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He defeating<br />the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants and<br />maids.</p>
<p>Period of Adhirajendra Chola {A.D1070-1073}</p>
<p>With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{A.D1070-1074}<br />succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-regent<br />from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period of few<br />months due to illness.</p>
<p>During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari<br />Athirajathirajadever who also bore the title "Virakeralan" ruling<br />from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at<br />Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps.</p>
<p>Period of Kulothtunga Chola {A.D1070-1120}</p>
<p>After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in the Chola<br />country with no direct male decendents in the line of the Rajaraja<br />Chola ? 1 to succeed.</p>
<p>Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely<br />Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful heir to the<br />chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja in the<br />year A.D.1074.</p>
<p>Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the Chera<br />kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain freedom from<br />from the Chola kings.</p>
<p>Kulothtunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. He<br />captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of Kumari<br />all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a subordinate king<br />and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he stationd a<br />nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under the<br />general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan.</p>
<p>Kulothtunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in<br />Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar forces<br />(suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his death in<br />this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma {A.D.1082-<br />1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to Cholas.</p>
<p>He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at<br />Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 Rama Varma<br />Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the Cholas and<br />regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothtunga Chola ? 1<br />didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost territories of the<br />Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 years of<br />intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras.</p>
<p>The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more Chola-Chera<br />conflicts after Kulothtunga ? 1 during the period of the remaing<br />Cholas upto A.D.1250</p>

<p>      I have a question. The so-called 'Keralaanthagan' - who was <br />    defeated by Rajaraja Cholan - was he a Chera King? The entire <br />Kerala <br />    of those days belonged to Chera right? or was there a small <br />portion <br />    of the region that belonged to a different kingdom which wasnt of <br />    Chola, Chera or Pandya mixture?</p>

<p>    southern kerala was an independent kingdom which was invaded <br />through <br />    kollam pass by cholans. northern dynasty was either subordinates <br />to <br />    cholas or the chalukyas. <br />      Expecting your reply.</p>
<p>    kerala could recover from the cholan -chalukyan hagemony only <br />breifly <br />    in 1350s during veera ravi udhaya marthanda varma. subsequently <br />    cheras fell again. there was a sort of local rule by 8 veetil </p>
<p>    pillaimars during 14-15th centuries. this was very corrupt and <br />often <br />    disliked by keralites. however in the northern kerala the <br />samudris <br />    had a partial kingdom which was invaded by portugese,dutch, <br />french <br />    and british one by one. unlike the east coast the west coast of <br />    tamilagam fell easily to the plunder of europeans both <br />politically <br />    and physically. the people were abused by european seafarers and <br />    resulting was a peculiar racial feature. places like tellicherry <br />is a <br />    telling example how much european gene admixture has taken place.</p>

<p>Dear Gandhiram,</p>
<p>Keralanthahan divides into Kerala + Anthahan. Anthaham is a Sanskrit<br />word meaning "the end" or "finish". Kerala Anthahan means the one who<br />has "put an end" or "finished" (i.e.captured)the Keralam. This was a<br />title of Rajaraja Chola - 1 (A.D.984-1014)which he bore after his<br />capture of Kerala. He has named a Brahmin Settlement as Keralanthaha<br />Chathurvedi Mangalam. He has named one of the main entrance to<br />Thanjavur Rajarajaeswarem as Kerlanthaka Vaayil, etc. </p>
<p>The capture of Kandalur Salai or Vilignam or Kollam never meant that<br />he captured the Kerala. It was his capture of Kudamalai Nadu with its<br />capital at Mahodai the present Kodungallur, which meant he captured<br />the Kerala. The regions of Kollam, Vilignam, Kandalur Salai all were<br />under different subordinate kings of Kerala who accepted the authority<br />of the Kerala King at Mahodai of this period. </p>

        <p>Hi Vj,</p>
<p>Regarding the gopuram names, i think the first gopuram has the name as<br />Keralanthagan vaayal, then comes the rajarajan vaayal.</p>
<p>Correct me if i am wrong.</p>

<blockquote><p>  I have a question. The so-called 'Keralaanthagan' - who was <br />defeated by Rajaraja Cholan - was he a Chera King? The entire Kerala </p></blockquote>
<p>of those days belonged to Chera right? or was there a small portion <br />of the region that belonged to a different kingdom which wasnt of <br />Chola, Chera or Pandya mixture?</p>
<p>re:....rajaraja defeated the combined chera-pandya dynasty near <br />kandhaloor. for details read kandhaloor vasanthakumaran kadhai by <br />sujatha vikatan publications and balakumaran's udayar.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Yesterday there was an argument with my collegue who said <br />that 'Kerala was not invaded by any north indian invasion'. I said </p></blockquote>
<p>that 'Yes,but the entire south India was under the control of the <br />Moovendhars and Kerala was nothing but Chera Nadu. That's why nobody <br />could enter. But he said that some part of Kerala was a seperate <br />kingdom. </p>
<p>re:...yes northern portion of kerala was ruled by samudri rajas. they <br />were not direct descendents of cheraman perumals. but related to <br />them. they were nayars. they had significant admixture with brahmins <br />and vellaalars.</p>
<blockquote><p>  I would like to know if he is correct?</p></blockquote>
<p>southern kerala was an independent kingdom which was invaded through <br />kollam pass by cholans. northern dynasty was either subordinates to <br />cholas or the chalukyas. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Expecting your reply.</p></blockquote>
<p>kerala could recover from the cholan -chalukyan hagemony only breifly <br />in 1350s during veera ravi udhaya marthanda varma. subsequently <br />cheras fell again. there was a sort of local rule by 8 veetil <br />pillaimars during 14-15th centuries. this was very corrupt and often <br />disliked by keralites. however in the northern kerala the samudris <br />had a partial kingdom which was invaded by portugese,dutch, french <br />and british one by one. unlike the east coast the west coast of <br />tamilagam fell easily to the plunder of europeans both politically <br />and physically. the people were abused by european seafarers and <br />resulting was a peculiar racial feature. places like tellicherry is a <br />telling example how much european gene admixture has taken place.</p>
<p>in fact the coastline between goa and capecomorin is the slave coast <br />of india. the southern and northern kingdoms were reestabilished by <br />late 18th century. the southern kingdom continued as travancore <br />princely state. the northern kingdom fell to tippu and subsequently <br />annexed with british madras province.</p>
