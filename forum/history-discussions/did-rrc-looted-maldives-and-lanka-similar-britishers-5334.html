</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I feel, this is an interesting twist to our earlier discussions.</p>
<p>Can we compare <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  to the britishers, on equal footing?</p>
<p>Did <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  commit so much damage to the lankan empires?</p>
<p>Is there any type of Jallianwala bagh happened in lanka during <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's war<br />on it?</acronym></p>
<p>How was those wars characterised of?</p>
<p>Are the women raped during those wars of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ?</p>
<p>IS the buddhist stupas and monasteries destoryed?</p>
<p>Is so, what is the reason for it, and can it be compared to the<br />destruction of Hindu temples by the muslims?</p>
<p>I was really confused at this..</p>
<p>I just wanted to know, how was the wars of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  times characterised of. <br />As far as my knowledge is concerned, there were only political prisoners<br />and NOT any who were abused or exploitated.</acronym></p>
<p>Regards,<br />Senthil Raja</p>

<p>    I dont think this argument is going anywhere. But I feel Sri and<br />    Venkat refuses to accept the ill's the british has left back.</p>
<p>  One man's gain is other man's loss - its survival of the fittest and<br />  has been in vougue from time immemorial. its the unwritten code of<br />  nature - a marauding male lion on taking over a pride ensures that<br />  it kills every cub of his predessesor - so that lionesses can beget<br />  his progency quicker and he can ensure his succession. the lioness<br />  too carries no ill accepts fate and communes with the killer of its<br />  cubs!!! thats the harsh truth of survival.</p>
<p>  every conquerer plundered - gold, god - glory. the anals of history<br />  dont often bear signs of the vanquished - so you often get to see<br />  only one side....was RJC a plunderer - when he got back the pandya<br />  diadem along with the lankan crown jewels - the sri lankan anals<br />  talk of wholesome destruction of buddhist stupas/ scultures etc. war<br />  trophies....right from pallava times kings have brought back war<br />  trophies - do you think they were gifts - vatapi was burned - wealth<br />  ( gold, statutes, men, women)were brought back to be lavished on our<br />  temples..... not that we were foreever humble people not interfering<br />  in others affairs...how many times have the moovendars interfered in<br />  the affairs of lanka....why did RRc capture maldives of all places -<br />  to safe gaurd his growing sea trade, similar designs have been<br />  attributed to rjc's kedaram campaign. ....the tide was turned during<br />  kafur period. just like a once powerful lion with the passage of<br />  time, gets weaker and is displaced by a younger more powerful one -<br />  just this time, it was from a distant, different tribe and more<br />  ferocious.</p>

<p>&lt;<i think except bramhins everybody fought the wars.  </p>
<p>The texts about war, war-medicine, yoga and everything else was written in Sanskrit. <br />Only Brahmins could understand Sanskrit as they were privileged. So depending on the real time situation in war field only Brahmins(sanskrit knowing) could recall the relevant sloka and make appropriate decision as the situation demanded in the war-field.<br />So most probably the infantry was made of brahmins or sanskrit knowing varnas.<br />I think that is why we lost to the British, we did not involve as much sanskrit knowing people in the infantry as possible against the British.</p>
<p>Do I make sense ?</p>

<p>this is the post from agathiar </p></blockquote>
<p>The inhabitants of the kingdom worship idols and many of them <br />worship oxen.<br />Under no circumstances will they eat beef, nor will they kill an <br />ox.All the<br />houses are smeared with cowdung.There are some people called GAVI <br />who eat<br />beaf but only when the cow is dead by natural causes.</p>
<p>In this kingdom everyone including the king sits on the ground, when<br />questiond why they do not sit a more dignified manner, they reply <br />that it<br />is extremely dignified to sit on the ground as we ourselves are made <br />up of<br />the earth and destined to return to the earth, so the earth so be<br />respected and not to be held in contempt. There is rice but no corn <br />in the<br />kingdom.</p>
<p>The men go to war with lances but completely naked.They are not in <br />the<br />least brave but are miserable and cowardly people.They do not kill <br />animals<br />but if they want to eat them they ask saracens or people of other <br />religion<br />to kill it for them. The men and women wash their body in water <br />twice a<br />day.They do not dare to eat either in the morning or in the evening <br />without<br />having washed first.They drink only out of their personal cup and <br />never put<br />to their lips but hold above their heads, pouring the wine down their<br />throats.</p>

<p>Now I will quit these particulars, and tell you of the most precious <br />article that exists in the world. You must know that rubies are <br />found in this Island and in no other country in the world but this. <br />They find there also sapphires and topazes and amethysts, and many <br />other stones of price. And the King of this Island possesses a ruby <br />which is the finest and biggest in the world; I will tell you what <br />it is like. It is about a palm in length, and as thick as a man's <br />arm; to look at, it is the most resplendent object upon earth; it is <br />quite free from flaw and as red as fire. Its value is so great that <br />a price for it in money could hardly be named at all. You must know <br />that the Great Kaan sent an embassy and begged the King as a favour <br />greatly desired by him to sell him this ruby, offering to give for <br />it the ransom of a city, or in fact what the King would. But the <br />King replied that on no account whatever would he sell it, for it <br />had come to him from his ancestors.[NOTE 5]</p>
<p>The people of Seilan are no soldiers, but poor cowardly creatures. <br />And when they have need of soldiers they get Saracen troops from <br />foreign parts.</p>

          Did RRC looted maldives and lanka, similar to britishers?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Venkat,</p>
<p>I feel, you are degrading our own kings too much. The soldiers did<br />not participate in war, not just for loots. There could be more than<br />that..</p>
<p>Those who participated in war belongs to all castes.. In the epic of<br />our community Called the Annanmar stories, it was mentioned that the<br />vellala king "Kundrudaiyan" was alloted an area to govern by the chola<br />king. (Ponnar Sankar kavyam was written by kalaignar itself)</p>
<p>His sons Ponnar &amp; sankar, were assisted by Sambavan who belongs to a<br />caste presently classified as SC.</p>
<p>This story is supposed to have taken place by 12th century.</p>
<p>So, we need to research on how the kingdom is structured, and how they<br />collected armies to fight for.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, a kingdom is nothing but the consolidation of small<br />rulers. Some times, when a king takes over another, all their sub<br />rulers, might have accepted the victor's rule. Or for the fact that,<br />the common people, are NOT disturbed, while those who settled at the<br />capital of the kingdom might have been arrested.</p>
<p>Some times, when a victorious king, might appoint another men to an<br />area, if the previous one is not good enough.</p>
<p>So, the same local chief, might have taken part on both chola and<br />panyan kings, depending on various factors, like moral reasoning, or<br />one of the kings might have mis-ruled, or the local chief might be<br />under the dominance of a king.</p>
<p>But to the local chief, who ever rules, there is no difference. He is<br />going to pay the tax.</p>
<p>so, the war is mostly an events among the kshatriya classes, among<br />kingdoms, where ordinary people were not that much affected. Because,<br />unlike in western nations, where the king had absolute power over all<br />his subjects, in our political system, the power structure was highly<br />distributed.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Senthil Raja</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi<br />  there are no rules governing war.<br />  if either you live or die in the end of the day you dont follow rules.<br />  dont get carried away by the mahabarat or ramayan serials. people <br />  fought with all their cunning and tactics in wars.<br />  ban on night fighting and other morals is not logical when your enemy <br />  has a sword in hand.</p>
<p>  I dont think there was a specific caste called kshatriyas in the <br />  later periods. ofcourse the warrior castes like vanniyars and devars <br />  must have been the back bone of thwe army.<br />  as early as 8th century i think paranjothi who headed the pallava <br />  armies was a vellalar.<br />  even appars brother inlaw a vellaalar was a commander.<br />  i think except bramhins everybody fought the wars.<br />  there were cases of the lowermost varnas capturing power like the <br />  kakatiyas. one of the most powerful empires from warrangal they were <br />  about to turn their eyes on tamil land before malik destroyed them.</p>
<p>  the kings fought for land, the armies fought for loot and the common <br />  man suffered in every way. </p></blockquote>

          Did RRC looted maldives and lanka, similar to britishers?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Let keep the discussions as far as possible closer to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . I had the <br />good fortune of attending a talk organised by the singapore library <br />last evening - the topic was </acronym></p>
<p>The Imperial Cholas: An 11th Century Example of Regional Power Play <br />in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>the paper was presented by a Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow, Mr <br />Prasanna Weerawardane. ( will circulate once i get a copy).</p>
<p>While the paper was interesting, there were a few grey areas, thanks <br />to the little knowledge i gained by being a part of this group and <br />reading the archives i took this up and it was well appareciated. <br />listing below:</p>
<p>The paper projected the cholas as a warring clan - eager to invade, <br />raid countries for furthering their interests:</p>
<p>- examples were cited from the chornicle ( culavamsa) - of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  <br />taking back untold treasures, pillage the anuradhapura vihara etc.<br />- unlike other campaigns - the cholas wanted to annexe lanka for its <br />resources.<br />- the cholas ill treated the royal women and took away king mahinda <br />IV and his wife to madura where he died.</acronym></p>
<p>- the first attack on srivijaya by <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  was because they went on a <br />specific disinformation on the chola power - leading to the first <br />envoy from chola land being treated as an insignificant kingdom by <br />the sung dynasty.<br />- the profits from these raids were used to shower gifts on the big <br />temple<br />- the second raid on srivijaya by kullottunga was caused by the <br />srilankan king seeking his aid to fight the cholas - the help was by <br />providing products from the peninsula to aid the srilankan army/pay <br />for their expenses. the attack was against this aid.<br />- the buddhist viharam in nagapatinam was set up bascially to attact <br />trade.</acronym></p>
<p>while it was heartening to note the amount of interest the cholas <br />still hold among the intellectual faternity here, my arguments were <br />as below:</p>
<p>1. The lankan angle has been going on since pallava period and the <br />incursions were not unilateral. the lankan crown did interfere in <br />the affairs of the chola state due to their close relations with the <br />pandya crown.</p>
<p>2. the pillage might have been in search of the pandya diadems - <br />which the chola wanted back to ensure peace reigned in his state. so <br />the cholas were acting in self defense to ensure stability by <br />closing out the pandya for good.</p>
<p>3. mahinda IV and his queen were taken back to madurai to stay in a <br />palace and he lived a further 12 years there before eventually <br />dying. what was the reason for this? the chola/pandya style of <br />disposing an enemy is evident from their titles - chop the head off -<br />yet they let the lankan king live for 12 years </p>
<p>4. right from pallava period buddha is shown as a sub incar of <br />krishna and worshipped. even though south indian kings were <br />frequently at war, they never touched the temples. so there was a <br />sanctity associated with temples. the viharam was supported through <br />generous grants by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ,and these grants were further re instated by <br />kulottunga. hence it could be a one sided account of the mahavamsa <br />to say that the viharams of lanka were destroyed. </acronym></p>
<p>5. complete annhiliation of sri vijaya doesnt quite justify the <br />chola style of functioning. just the system of misinforming the usng <br />dynasty by the sri vijaya could not have been a reason for such a <br />massive strike. at the same time the cambodian king was paying <br />tributes - he gifted his famous chariot to the chola king. </p>

<p>The argument is like this -<br />If you remove/disparge all Sangam/Tamil Kings contribution then there will be no concept of family, language(grammar) or writing(script) to talk of. Tamils would have been living like animals.</p>
<p>But even otherwise taking your argument further the British/British bureaucrats did eliminate lot of sources which did not agree with their worldview in the name of enemy propaganda. Ex - the villagers records of people who opposed the British. They did leave out a number of plates from Ganga dynasty terming it as spurious as well as other inscriptions. They have dropped out of the view completely now.</p>
<p>The British/British bureaucrats sources are propaganda material given a semblance of normalcy/reality. It is plain vain self-glorification for the British and their Indian bureaucrats. </p>
<p>We know what the american anthropologist are doing supporting the miltary right now.</p>
<p>For all we care the 'Bhumihar Brahmin' might have been the precursor to the ones in Bihar today, fighting for their rights in 1857 to practice their crafts on Yadavs. To get their true story it might be better to contact the Yadavs of North India.</p>
<p>I do not want to get into the question of British vs Indian discussion which just concluded in the list.</p>
<p>My initial question was related to kshatriyas vs Tamil society. We got side tracked I guess.</p>

<p>    I dont think there was a specific caste called kshatriyas in the <br />    later periods. ofcourse the warrior castes like vanniyars and <br />  devars <br />    must have been the back bone of thwe army.<br />    as early as 8th century i think paranjothi who headed the pallava <br />    armies was a vellalar.<br />    even appars brother inlaw a vellaalar was a commander.<br />    i think except bramhins everybody fought the wars.<br />    there were cases of the lowermost varnas capturing power like the <br />    kakatiyas. one of the most powerful empires from warrangal they <br />  were <br />    about to turn their eyes on tamil land before malik destroyed <br />them.</p>

<p>      My question was related to </p>
<p>      &lt;<1. Is the Wars were waged only between the kshatriyas, <br />leaving <br />    the<br />      common mass undisturbed? <br />      Answer: Vijay had mentioned the Satyasriya's inscription of the <br />  RRC <br />    destroying his caste by taking away the women, killing children <br />and <br />    everyone. Common man was always disturbed, common way raped, <br />taken <br />    away, (Dr.JB had a thread on "vezham").  </1.></p>
<p>      specifically the rape and killing of other caste women. Finally <br />    that is what it boils down to in Hindu discourse. How can Varna <br />    practicing kshatriyas rape other caste women?<br />      What is the motivation for men joining war - plain war,loot, <br />    women etc.</p>

<p>      kalki writes rather honestly about looting by the pallava king <br />  but <br />      somehow varnishes the truth with RRc's invasion. this has <br />clouded <br />    the <br />      judgement on the cholas. mahavamsa details the destruction by <br />the <br />      cholas.infact kalki creates a big issue of even rations not <br />being <br />      taken from the enslaved land.</p>

        <p>Dear Pandiyan</p>
<p>Initially, Sanskrit was available to everyone. knowledge of vedas was however restricted to the brahmanas (brahamana of vedic ages is different from today's brahmin).But again, over time, what you say could have happened, the base probably got clouded. Lord Krsna explains the 4 castes in the Gita, technically a family can have all people for all castes.<br />The best example of how this degenerated may be explained with the saint ramanuja story of preaching the mantra from temple top.<br />Technically it was quite complex to mix both languages, thats a fascinating aspect of thirupugazh, a classic blend of multiple languages in the praise of the lord.</p>

<p>&lt;<i think except bramhins everybody fought the wars.  </p>
<p>The texts about war, war-medicine, yoga and everything else was written in Sanskrit. <br />Only Brahmins could understand Sanskrit as they were privileged. So depending on the real time situation in war field only Brahmins(sanskrit knowing) could recall the relevant sloka and make appropriate decision as the situation demanded in the war-field.<br />So most probably the infantry was made of brahmins or sanskrit knowing varnas.<br />I think that is why we lost to the British, we did not involve as much sanskrit knowing people in the infantry as possible against the British.</p>

          Did RRC looted maldives and lanka, similar to britishers?        </div>

        <p>Hi Pandiyan</p>
<p>what slokas are you talking about?<br />artha sastra?<br />I think artha sastra lost its relevance soon after it was written.<br />it even gives suggestions on what the king should do in the morning, <br />the noon and the evening.I am not sure how many kings followed it.<br />however it did insist on a position of a raja rishi who had to guide <br />the king.<br />during the period we are interested in 90% of battles were about <br />short day long skirmishes.not much time for rules.<br />and i dont think kings from all parts of the country were instructed <br />in artha sastra.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  I think that is why we lost to the British, we did not involve as <br />much sanskrit knowing people in the infantry as possible against the </p></blockquote>
<p>British.</p>
<blockquote><p>those who fought predominantly in 1857 seem to be bramhins rani of </p></blockquote>
<p>jhansi, the peshwas, nana saheb( adopted) were bramhins. mangal <br />pandey too could have been one . some accounts claims that Mangal <br />Pandey was born in a Bhumihar Brahmin family to Divakar Pandey of <br />Surhupur village <br />so what do you derive from this. we used too many bramhins?<br />I dont think you can interpret like this.<br />venketesh</p>

        <p>&lt;<i think except bramhins everybody fought the wars.  </p>
<p>The texts about war, war-medicine, yoga and everything else was written in Sanskrit. <br />Only Brahmins could understand Sanskrit as they were privileged. So depending on the real time situation in war field only Brahmins(sanskrit knowing) could recall the relevant sloka and make appropriate decision as the situation demanded in the war-field.<br />So most probably the infantry was made of brahmins or sanskrit knowing varnas.<br />I think that is why we lost to the British, we did not involve as much sanskrit knowing people in the infantry as possible against the British.</p>

        <p>Somewhere in the long timeline, the morals must have been lost. <br />The purpose is to find where the chains were broken and restore them'<br />I have not read on any of the epic wars were abduction and molesting of women take place.<br />The only instances of such code of conduct being crossed was with Vaalee and Ravana. <br />I am talking of earthly avtars or existances... not of gandharva or deva - their code of conduct is under different set of rules.</p>

<p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>War is Ruthless.. Its no doubt. Infact, from what i understood from<br />my little knowledge of our tamil literature, which i studied during my<br />school days is, that, the ruthlessness is attributed to bravery.. A<br />brave man is aggressive..</p>
<p>But, i feel, there is large difference between the wars waged by us,<br />and the wars waged by the invaders.</p>
<p>I would like to know more on the following points..</p>
<p>1. Is the Wars were waged only between the kshatriyas, leaving the<br />common mass undisturbed?<br />Answer: Vijay had mentioned the Satyasriya's inscription of the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  destroying his caste by taking away the women, killing children and everyone. Common man was always disturbed, common way raped, taken away, (Dr.JB had a thread on "vezham").</p>
<p>2. How was the political prisoners treated? Getting imprisoned is<br />different from getting looted, exploited, tortured and abused by the<br />enemy.<br />Answer: See the first answer. How would a person feel when his wife is taken away and made as a part of the prostitution ring? Vezham is another form where in women from enemy household are used as glorified sex-providers for the victorious clan.</p>
<p>3. How was the relation b/w men &amp; women on those days... what i<br />understood is that, for the kshatriyas, the women captured in the war<br />belongs to only kshatriya caste, and not from common people.. <br />Answer: Refer to answer in 1.</p>
<p>4. The mughal invasion is characterised by full of hatred, and by the<br />policy of dar-ul-islam. . ie muslims and kafirs.. the kafirs are<br />either to be converted or to be destroyed.. so, their wars were<br />mostly of barbaric.. where, the entire civilisation is being destroyed..<br />But, i feel, our wars cannot be classified on par with them.. <br />Firstly, they may be ruthless... the palaces were destroyed.. the<br />defeated people were imprisoned. But, there is a basic level of<br />decency, and a raja dharma, where the prisoners were treated properly,<br />although they were used for most of the labour works.<br />Answer: Mughals started differently from the first muslim invasion, as they themselves invaded Khilji and slave kingdom at delhi. There is no raja dharma when it comes to war. There is no victor in the entire history who would treat their vanquished subjects differently.</p>
<p>5. Did the molesting &amp; raping of women, done by all our kings or only<br />by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ? Does women from common masses are also affected?<br />Answer: Everyone does it. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was just following what was done before.</p>
<p>6. In Goa Inquisition, the dutch christians, unleashed all barbarism<br />on us.. for eg, the husband is tied to a pole, and his wife is raped<br />in front of him.. then the genitals of the husband is cut-down before<br />his wife. Then, his legs are tied to two bamboo poles, and then<br />released apart, where his body will teared in to two..<br />Answer: We have our own form of punishments, Kazhu-vetral, Koon pandiyan destroys Jainism in Pandya country, after the Jain priestly are defeated by Sambandar in the various vaathams. Dr.JB had posted a picture of the same from Madurai temple sometime back. I am not sure if the link is still active.</p>
<p>I feel, such level of barbarism could not have happened by our kings..<br />Beheading, killing by striking the chest are all held as virtues of<br />brave men, while stabbing from the back, running away from the war<br />field were considered as shameful acts..</p>
<p>We could not compare the political prisoners with slaves.. slaves<br />were treated cheaper than animals, while prisoners were treated with<br />some humanity..</p>
<p>so, my final conclusion is that "Ruthlessness is a characteristics of<br />war..But, barbarism is different from ruthlesness"</p>

<p>  Hi Raja,</p>
<p>  War is war - what else can it be - you come across instances of the <br />  ruthlessness of war in every day of the kurukshetra war. </p>
<p>  the problem is that we have been sold an image of RRC by kalki which <br />  is very hard to shake. Beleive me, get your hands on a copy of the <br />  mahavamsa ( the lankan chronicle).. ...slaves were taken even prior <br />  to rrc times. without going into detail there are accounts of <br />  lankans in large numbers ( in thousands) brought as slaves - again <br />  all this is speculation - karikalan is said to hv brought 12000 to <br />  build the kallanai. gaja bahu is said to hv come and liberated these <br />  and taken an equal number of tamils back....again contradicting <br />  accounts of this event come up.</p>
<p>  RJC not only recovered the pandya diadem but also the crown of <br />  lankan king, and not stopping at that - brought the king mahinda V <br />  and his queen and kept them under house arrest in madurai. the king <br />  died after 12 years in captivity in madurai.Anuradhapur a, the 1400-<br />  year-old capital of Sinhala kings was destroyed - The destruction <br />  was so extensive the city was abandoned. Cholas made the city of <br />  Polonnaruwa as their capital...</p>
<p>  According to the Hottur inscriptions of Satyasraya, dated 1007 ?&#128;&#147; <br />  1008 C.E., the Chola king with a force numbering nine hundred <br />  thousand had `pillaged the whole country, had slaughtered the women, <br />  the children and the Brahmans, and, taking the girls to wife, had <br />  destroyed their caste' - this was a campaign personally led by RJC <br />  as a general under RRC.</p>
<p>  If you look further into RJC kedaram campagin and his war against <br />  sri vijaya - war trophies abound...so too are the number of war <br />  trophies that you see in GKC....the big temple itself is claimed to <br />  hv built with slave labour ( caputred armies)...Aditya claim to fame <br />  pandyan thalai konda - he is supposed to beheaded veerapandya and <br />  mounted the head on a bamboo pole and left it rotting outside <br />  tanjore for weeks....</p>

<p>Temples were strictly off limits - thats why these edicts survived - <br />i guess the reason for carving the lengthly meeikirthi's on temple <br />walls ( most of them are simple endowments for lighting a anaiya <br />villaku or this vessel etc etc) - only the last couple of lines are <br />relevant to the endowment - rest 95% deal with the king's fame - was <br />to ensure that they survived for posterity. imagine the ignomity of <br />a king who sees his clan tranished by his opponent on a temple wall -<br />he couldnt touch it...he could melt the coins, destroy the palaces -<br />but he could do nothing with the temple edict. the donations also <br />survived , so did the wealth of the temples - they were the central <br />repository.... atleast till gazni in the north and kafur in the <br />south - decided to encash...</p>

        <p>I guess Satish hit the bulls eye on the note.<br />It looks like some sort of symbolization on a venduthal or parikaram. <br />The story of parasurama chopping his mothers head could look brutal but thats only a part of the bigger scheme. <br />There are stories of Ettukudi and Enkann Muruga temples of what happened to the sculpturor, usually there is a pre and post case prior to these events. <br />Unless the entire story is known, its not easy to classify these as barbaric, though on the top it looks so. In all essence, these could be mythological.</p>

<p>I have a different notion. Its not mass hanging. I think the small <br />figure (Second from left) is sambandar indulged in a debate with <br />jains (??) as they seem to be nude. There is a slanting line in <br />between them, probably debating without seeing each other, probably <br />behind a door or screen..as usual practice for those who dont wish <br />to see outsiders. Those who lost the debate committed suicide and <br />the panel might be glorifying sambandar that, he won so many jains <br />in his debate.

<p>There were practices like offering their parts of body - nine parts <br />(nava kandam), their head (sira kandam) etc. Probably females didnt <br />had the strength to chop off the bones and cut them off and hence <br />males help them to offer their tounge or hands...in the panel where <br />tongue is being cut, all are in a pose that is of prayer and not a <br />brutal act.</p>

<p>there is a female (features are not clear, but the height difference <br />makes us to assume, a beauty of the artistic skill) besides the man <br />folding her hands, which again cannot be done during a killing. <br />Probably its a kala sambhara murthy and the small figure can be <br />markandeyan.</p>

<p>  (1) The Re-Emergence of the Chola Kingdom</p>
<p>Cholas <br />  gradually re-emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty of Tamilnadu, <br />after <br />  a long spell of nearly six centuries both in political obscurity <br />and <br />  as feudatory of the Kalabra, Pallava and Pandiya dynasties of <br />South <br />  India.</p>
<p>  (2) Vijayaalaya Chola reigns from his capital Palaiyaarai in <br />Tamilnadu</p>
<p>  In the line of these Cholas sprung king Vijayaalaya Chola (A.D.849-<br />  881) ruling a small central region of the present Tamilnadu state <br />  with his capital at Palaiyaarai, and as a feudatory of the Pallava <br />  king Nandivarman - 3 (A.D.826-850).</p>
<p>  (3) Vijayaalaya Chola builds his new capital at Thanjaavur</p>

<p>  In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola died and was succeeded by his <br />son <br />  Rajadhiraja Chola. At the time of his acension Sri Lanka was still <br />  under the Cholas.</p>
<p>  Rajadhiraja appointed his brother as the viceroy king in north Sri <br />  Lanka with the title Illangaiyarkku Irraivan. </p>
<p>  (44) Rajadhiraja Chola sends fresh expeditions to south Sri Lanka</p>
<p>  In Sri Lanka in the year of A.D. 1044 Mahalanakitti had to face <br />fresh <br />  attacks of the Chola forces stationed in north Sri Lanka in which <br />he <br />  was defeated and again Rohana fell into the hands of the Cholas. <br />All <br />  his treasures were transported to the Chola kingdom and <br />consequently <br />  he commited suicide.</p>
<p>  During this time Vikkrama Pandian the son of Mahalanakitti born to <br />a <br />  Pandian queen from Tamilnadu fled to India.</p>
<p>  (45) Vikkrama Pandian attempts to regain Rohana</p>
<p>  However at a latter stage he came to Rohana from his hideout in <br />  Tuluva country in India and was trying for three years to <br />gradually <br />  eastablish himself over this territory.</p>
<p>  Rajadhiraja sent an expedition and defeated him in A.D.1047 where <br />he <br />  lost his crown to Cholas, and went to his hiding in Rohana.</p>
<p>  (46) Rule of North Indian king in south Sri Lanka</p>
<p>  During this period the north Indian king Virasalamehan alias <br />  Jegathipala from Kanyakubja near present Ayodhiya came to Sri <br />Lanka <br />  and captured Rohana, killed Vikkrama Pandian and ruled for a <br />period <br />  of four years.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1051 Rajadhiraja sent a further expedition which <br />  defeated this North Indian king and captured Rohana again, with <br />his <br />  crown, queen, and daughter who were transported to the Chola <br />kingdom.</p>
<p>  (47) Brahmins settled at Kantalai in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>  During this period the Chola officers in Sri Lanka established a <br />  settlement of Brahmin priests at Kantalai in the present <br />Trincomalee <br />  district and named it as Jeyamkonda Chathurvedimangalam after one <br />of <br />  the titles of Rajadhiraja.</p>
<p>  (48) Rajadhiraja appoints his heir apparent</p>
<p>  In the same year Rajadhiraja made his younger brother Rajendra ?2 <br />as <br />  his heir apparent and co-ruler of the Chola empire.</p>
<p>  (49) Further Chola war in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>  Again in Sri Lanka in A.D.1053 Parakrama Pandian alias Sri Vallaba <br />  Madanarajan the son of Vikkrama Pandian tried to release Rohana <br />from <br />  Chola sway. Rajadhiraja sent another expedition which killed and <br />  captured his crown.</p>
<p>  (50) Rajendra Chola - 2 ascends on the Chola throne </p>
<p>  Rajadhiraja died in A.D.1054 in the battlefield in a war with the <br />  western Chalukiyas of the present Karnataka state in the Indian <br />  mainland. His younger brother Rajendra ?2 who was with him at the <br />  warfront proclaimed himself as the emperor , and crowned himself <br />as <br />  the successor to the Chola throne.</p>
<p>  (51) Rajendra Chola wages war with Sri Lanka </p>
<p>  In A.D. 1055 again fresh eruptions took place at Rohana in Sri <br />Lanka. <br />  Manabarna a decendent of the earlier Sinhala king with the <br />assistance <br />  of a Kalinga prince of India the Virasalamehan, was taking efforts <br />to <br />  re-establish himself at Rohana.</p>
<p>  Rajendra sent an expedition to Sri Lanka defeated and killed <br />  Virasalamehan and took the two sons of Manabharna as captives. The <br />  general Jeyamurinadalvar was left in command of the Chola forces <br />  stationed in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>  Rajendra Chola-2 issued a rare silver coin of the Sri Lanka type <br />  showing on the obverse the legend Sri Rajendra in Nagari letters <br />and <br />  the Chola seated tiger on the reverse. </p>
<p>  (56) Other events during the rule of Rajendra Chola ? 2 </p>
<p>  In he year A.D.1056 Valavan Pitan Caravan of the Ilaiya Mummuti <br />Chola <br />  Annukkar and of the Perumpatai granted 26 cows for maintaining a <br />  lamp granted in the name of his son Narayanan to the Lord of <br />Padith <br />  Chola Iswarem.</p>
<p>  (57) Rajendra Chola ? 2 names his heir apparent</p>
<p>  Rajendra in the year A.D.1062 named his youngest brother <br />Virarajendra <br />  as his successor, with the premature death of his son, and his <br />  younger brother Rajamahendra.</p>
<p>  (58) Virarajendra Chola ascends throne as the next Chola emperor</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1063 with the death of Rajendra Chola - 2, <br />  Virarajendra Chola ascended the throne as the next successor to <br />the <br />  Chola empire.</p>
<p>  (59) Vijayabahu establishes himself at Rohana in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>  During this period in Sri Lanka a local Kesadhatu chief named <br />Kassapa <br />  set up his rule at Rohana with his seat at Kataragama. <br />(Kathirkamam).</p>
<p>  The Chola general stationed at Polonnaruwa not withstanding this <br />sent <br />  an army to Kattaragama against Kasspa in which the Chola forces <br />were <br />  defeated and retreated to the north. Kassapa now set up his <br />northern <br />  frontier at Rakkhapasana the present Rakwana and returd to <br />  Kattaragama.</p>
<p>  At this time the prince named Kitti the nephew of Vikkramabahu <br />with <br />  his seat at Sippathalaka also in Rohana was taking efforts to <br />  establish himself in this province. But Kassayappa sent his forces <br />to <br />  futile his attempt where he was defeated, and prince Kitti became <br />the <br />  ruler of Rohana with royal name Vijayabahu.</p>
<p>  He then made preparations to wage war with the Cholas in north Sri <br />  Lanka, but Virarajendra ordered the Chola general Jeyamurinadalvar <br />  stationed at Polonnaruwa to invade Kataragama. The Chola forces <br />  plundered Kataragama, but Vijayabahu escaped capture and the Chola <br />  forces returned to Polonnaruwa. Vijayabahu again returned to <br />  Sippatthalaka with strong forces and gradually established himself <br />in <br />  Rohona.</p>
<p>  (60) Vijayabahu seeks military aid from Burma</p>
<p>  He made fresh preparations to attack the Cholas, and sent a few <br />years <br />  prior to A.D.1067 envoys with rich presents to king Anuruddha <br />  (A.D.1044-1077) of Pagan who was also the overlord of Rammanadesa <br />  both being in present Burma, requesting for military assistance <br />  against Cholas.</p>
<p>  King Anuruddha on the other hand with no intention to create any <br />  enmity with the powerful Cholas, and also to prevent any strain in <br />  relations with Sri lanka, sent instead many ships with various <br />  valuable gifts to king Vijayabahu, who now changed his abode to <br />  Tambalagama.</p>
<p>  (61) Virarajendra sends fresh expedition to Sri Lanka</p>
<p>  During this period in north Sri Lanka many inhabitants grew <br />hostile <br />  and paid no tributes to the Chola kingdom. Vijayabahu too <br />continued <br />  with his attempts to oust Cholas from Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>  This made Virarajendra to send a fresh expedition to Sri Lanka in <br />the <br />  year A.D.1067 with many ships of large forces to the port of <br />  Mathottam in north Sri Lanka under the general Kurukulaththaraiyan.</p>
<p>  He successfully brought the Mummudi Chola mandalam the northern <br />half <br />  of Sri Lanka under the Chola control. He then proceeded to Rohana <br />  with his forces where two mighty warriors of Vijayabahu, Ravideva <br />  and Cala joined the Chola forces and fought against him.</p>
<p>  In this battle the Chola general Kurukulatharaiyan, and another <br />  commander lost their lives. This made Chola forces more furious in <br />  which Rohana again fell into the hands of the Cholas who took <br />  Vijayabahu's queen captive with many treasures while he escaped to <br />  his hideout. Again the whole of Sri Lanka came under the Chola <br />rule.</p>
<p>  (62) Virarajendra issues gold coin in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>  Virarajendra issued a gold coin so debased as to be hardly <br />  distinguishable from silver having the legend Sri Rajendrah in <br />nagari <br />  letters and on the reverse the Chola tiger between two lamps all <br />  under a canopy.<br />  (63) Virarajendra Chola appoints his heir apparent</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1067 Virarajendra named his son Adhirajendra Chola <br />as <br />  the heir apprarent to the Chola throne and a co-ruler of the <br />empire.</p>
<p>  (64) Kulothunga Chola succeeds on the throne of the Chola Empire </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1070 with the death of Viarajendra a rebellion <br />  sparked off in the Chola country in which Adhirajendra was <br />  assasinated and a state of anrachy prevailed in the kingdom.</p>
<p>  His untimely death with no heir apparent to succeed paved way for <br />  prince Rajendra of Vengi Nadu, as the next legitimate successor to <br />  the Chola throne through his maternal side in the year A.D.1071 <br />with <br />  the royal title Kulotunga Chola.</p>
<p>  (65) Vijayabahu saves Sri Lanka from Chola imperialism</p>
<p>  During this period in Sri Lanka the king Vijayabahu who earlier <br />hid <br />  in the south after his defeat at the hands of the Cholas, <br />gradually <br />  establised himself at Mahanagahula in the present Ambalangoda in <br />  south Sri Lanka, and struggled valiantly to relieve the island <br />from <br />  the long standing grip of Cholas.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1088 he sent two seperate armies with large forces <br />  simultaneously to the north-central province of Sri Lanka against <br />the <br />  Chola forces.</p>
<p>  The first unit of his troops intially captured the Chola <br />strongholds <br />  at the villages Muhunnuru, Badalatthagalla, Vapinagara, <br />Buddhigama, <br />  Tilagulla, Mahagalla, all in the Dakkinadesa the present <br />Kurunagala <br />  district and proceeded to Anuradhapura. Here too Chola forces were <br />  defeated and the city of Anuradhapura was captured . These troops <br />  further perssued and defeated the Chola forces upto the seaport of <br />  Mathottam alias Mahathittha in Mannar district.</p>
<p>  The second unit of troops of Vijayabahu was directed to the <br />eastern <br />  province avoiding the mountainous regions which defeated the Chola <br />  forces at Chagama in the south-central region of Sri lanka. When <br />they <br />  reached Pullathinagara the present Polonnnaruwa the Sinhala <br />generals <br />  requested Vijayabahu to join them quickly with further fresh <br />forces.</p>
<p>  Vijayabahu highly taken up by the heroic deeds of his forces <br />  proceeded to Polonnaruwa with his valiant army from his town <br />  Mahanugala. After the brief stay on the way in the close vicinity <br />of <br />  Mahiyangana Buddhist temple they reached Polonnaruwa along east <br />coast.</p>
<p>  The Chola forces stationed at various places in the close vicinity <br />  all gathered immediately at Polonnaruwa and had a great battle <br />with <br />  Sinhala forces. Vijayabahu's two great warriors Ravideva and Cala <br />who <br />  joined the Chola forces earlier against him, now re-joined <br />Vijayabahu <br />  and fought with determination to exterminate the Cholas, and <br />ending <br />  up with the victory to Sinhala forces.</p>
<p>  Vijayabahu to commemorate his victory over Cholas in Sri Lanka, <br />  assumed the title "Satru Rajachola Kula-anthaha'.</p>
<p>  (66) Vijayabahu marries the Kanyakubja Pricess </p>
<p>  During this period the wife and the daughter of the north Indian <br />king <br />  Jegathipala who were taken prisoners to Chola country after defeat <br />at <br />  the hands of Rajadhiraja-1 earlier at Rohana, escaped from Chola <br />  country and came back to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>  They met the king Vijayabahu who later married the daughter <br />  Leelawathie and took her as his first consort.</p>
<p>  (67) KulothungaChola attempts peace with Sri Lanka</p>
<p>  Kulothunga Chola on the reverse after a long weary expedition in <br />the <br />  far east seems to have decided to carry the balance regnal years <br />in <br />  peace and refrained from reacting further.</p>
<p>  In confirming his friendly relations he sought the hands of the <br />king <br />  Vijayabahu's sister Mitta, but Vijayabahu with much animosity <br />against <br />  cholas preferred the Pandiya prince in marriage to his sister who <br />  were long time allies of the sri Lankan kings.</p>
<p>  (59) The beginning of the disintegration o the Chola empire</p>
<p>  The loss of Sri Lanka from the fold of the cholas marked the <br />  beginning of the gradual disintegration of the Chola overseas <br />empire <br />  from its healm during the rule of Virarajendra.</p>
<p>  (60) King Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka plans war with Chola country</p>
<p>  Kullotunga to strengthen the good relations with Sri Lanka sent <br />  envoys with rich presents to king Vijayabahu. during this same <br />period <br />  the sinhala envoys who were on their way to Karnataka kingdom in <br />the <br />  Indian Mailand were humiliated in the Chola country by some <br />natives.</p>
<p>  Vijayabahu to avenge his anger over this incidence challenged <br />  Kulotunga for war through the same Chola envoys and gathered his <br />  troops at the seaports of Mathottam and Mattikavatatittha in the <br />  present Mannar district in the year A.D.1089.</p>
<p>  The Velaikkara forces of Chola who choose to stay back in Sri <br />Lanka <br />  and serve the Sinhala king after their defeat by Vijayabahu <br />earlier <br />  now revolted against him on his plan to wage war with thier <br />  motherland.</p>
<p>  In the revolt they caused destruction around Pullathinagara the <br />  present Polonnaruwa and captured the king's sister Mitta with her <br />  three sons. Vijayabahu escaped rebels and moved to south.</p>
<p>  However he returned back with his son Virabahu to Pullaththinagra <br />  defeated the rebels, released Mitta and her sons and established <br />  himself as the sole king of Sri lanka.</p>
<p>  (61) King Vijayabahu revives ambition to wage war with Cholas  </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1104 king Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka revived his <br />  ambition to fight the Cholas and awaited their forces at the ports <br />of <br />  Mannar in response to his challeng. However in the absense of <br />  reaction from the Cholas he returned to his capital Polonnaruwa.</p>
<p>  (62) Velaikkara Forces undertake to protect the Buddhist temple</p>
<p>  King Vijayabahu in the year A.D.1114 ordered his official Deva <br />  Senavirattar to construct a Buddhist temple at Vijayarajapura. He <br />on <br />  completion of same instructed the Vellaikkara Forces of the Cholas <br />  that remained back in Sri Lanka to take charge of protecting this <br />  temple.</p>
<p>  All divisionns of the Velaikkara forces, the Valanjiar, Nagarathar <br />  and others hgave the Muntrukai Velaikkara Daladayaperumpalli and <br />  jointly indrtook the management and protection of this temple and <br />the <br />  villages given as endowment, which they confirmed on stone slab in <br />  Tamil planted in Polonnaruwa district and on copper plates.</p>
<p>  (63) Jayabahu succeeds Vijayabahu on Sinhala throne</p>
<p>  In the same year of A.d.114 Vijayabahu died and was succeeded by <br />his <br />  brother Jayabahu as against traditions of succession on Sri Lankan <br />  throne preventing Vikkramabahu ?2 the son of Vijayabahu becoming <br />the <br />  king.</p>
<p>  (64) Kulotunga gives daughter in marraige to Sri Lankan Prince</p>
<p>  Kulotunga with a view to strengthen the relations with Sri Lanka <br />  after the death of Vijayabahu have away one of his daughters the <br />  Suthamallialvar in marriage to prince Manabarna alias Viraperumal <br />  alias Virabahu the son of Mitta the Vijayabahu's sister by a <br />Pandian <br />  Prince.</p>
<p>  (65) Kulotunga appoints his heir apparent</p>
<p>  Kullotunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1115 appointed his son Vikkrama Chola <br />  (A.D.1118-1135) as his heir apparent to the Chola Throne who <br />assisted <br />  him in the administration of the Chola empire.</p>
<p>  (66) Vikkramabahu's Officer provides Endowments to temple in India</p>
<p>  During this period Uiyavandhan Thiruvannamalaiyan alias Vijayabahu <br />  Masathunayan the chief officer of Vikkramabahu with the normalised <br />  relations of Cholas with Sri Lanka, after the death of Vijayabahu <br />  built at Kondakarudu Dakkarama on the banks of Godavari river in <br />  Andhra Pradesh in India a holy Pilgrims Rest named as Maheswaren <br />  Madam situated near the temple of Narenthira Iswarem Udaiya <br />Mahadevar.</p>
<p>  Later in the year A.D.1120 he gave black and brass utensils to <br />  Bhimeshwarem Udaya Mahadevar at Periya Dakkarambi iin the <br />  Guddhavadinadu a subdivision of Gangaikonda Cholavalanadu on the <br />  occasion of the solar eclipse.</p>
<p>  (67) Kulotunga's daughter gives endowments to Siva temple</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1122 Sutthamallialvar daughter of Kulotunga Chola <br />of <br />  Chola country the wife of Virapperumal (who was the son of Mitta <br />  sister Vijayabahu by a Pandyan king) made donations to the Siva <br />  temple known as Vikkrama Calamega Iswarem in Magala alias <br />Vikkirama <br />  Calamegapura in the present Budumuttawa in Nikaweratiya in Sri <br />Lanka, <br />  where she donated ten kasu for maintaing the burning a lamp, and a <br />  standing brass lamp too.  </p>
<p>  The Chola Relations with Sri Lanka goes further up to the last <br />Chola <br />  king namely the Rajendra Chola - 3 (1246- 1279), which will be <br />  continued later.</p></blockquote>

<p>g</p>
<p>I have a different notion. Its not mass hanging. I think the small <br />figure (Second from left) is sambandar indulged in a debate with <br />jains (??) as they seem to be nude. There is a slanting line in <br />between them, probably debating without seeing each other, probably <br />behind a door or screen..as usual practice for those who dont wish <br />to see outsiders. Those who lost the debate committed suicide and <br />the panel might be glorifying sambandar that, he won so many jains <br />in his debate. Look at the female figure next to sambandar, with <br />hands folded, in a praying posture. when some horryfying thing <br />happens no one will be in such a pose.</p>

<p>g</p>
<p>There were practices like offering their parts of body - nine parts <br />(nava kandam), their head (sira kandam) etc. Probably females didnt <br />had the strength to chop off the bones and cut them off and hence <br />males help them to offer their tounge or hands...in the panel where <br />tongue is being cut, all are in a pose that is of prayer and not a <br />brutal act.</p>
<blockquote><p>  spearing a man</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kumbakonam.info/kumbakonam/darsuam/images/vimpan/vpapu4.jp" title="http://www.kumbakonam.info/kumbakonam/darsuam/images/vimpan/vpapu4.jp">http://www.kumbakonam.info/kumbakonam/darsuam/images/vimpan/vpapu4.jp</a></p></blockquote>
<p>g</p>
<p>there is a female (features are not clear, but the height difference <br />makes us to assume, a beauty of the artistic skill) besides the man <br />folding her hands, which again cannot be done during a killing. <br />Probably its a kala sambhara murthy and the small figure can be <br />markandeyan.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Gladiators??</p>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A man is lying in a bed (sort of bench) may be sick or hurt and one <br />man tries to kill him and another stops him because killing an <br />unarmed man is not dharma. And the pose of the man in the bed looks <br />as if he is unable to do anything and trying to defend himself. </p>
<p>Thats what i percive from these and none of the pannel show anything <br />which portrays brutality of war or anything else.</p>

<p>  hi nanda</p>
<p>  Exactly my point - we need to look at things in perspective - thats <br />  why we need experts who can read these and explain to us - sadly <br />  nobody wants to encourage them, buy their books, engage them to <br />come <br />  and give lectures, present papers...they continue to do so out of <br />  their own interest - but how long will they last. </p>
<p>  a case in point, just take a look at this panel - the beauty of <br />this <br />  composition was explained by Dr Balu sir to me - the artistic <br />  expression has reached its zenith in just this one small sculpture, <br />  but how many know to appreciate</p>

<p>  This is a story from periapuranam</p>
<p>  without going too much into the specs, a devot family, in abject <br />  poverty, still find something to offer to others, shiva decides to <br />  test them, in a thunder filled rainy night lands up outside their <br />  hut and seeks alms/food, there is absolutely nothing to offer in <br />the <br />  house, the desperate man doesnt know what to do, his wife asks him <br />  to go to the field where they have sown paddy in the morning ( <br />vidai <br />  nel) - the man goes with a basket and sieves the grain back, which <br />  the devot wife, mills and makes food. serves the guest, who takes <br />  one bite and is so filled with emotion that he burts into a jyothi <br />- <br />  returns as shiva parvathi on nandi and gives darshan to the couple. <br />  the sculpture has to show this story in a panel that is the length <br />  of two pilot pens and 1 1/2 high.</p>

          Did RRC looted maldives and lanka, similar to britishers?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>----- Original Message ----<br />From: viru <senthil_nkkl@yahoo.com <br />To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />Sent: Tuesday, 27 November, 2007 12:01:58 PM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: Did <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  looted maldives and lanka, similar tobritishers?</p>
<p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>War is Ruthless.. Its no doubt. Infact, from what i understood from<br />my little knowledge of our tamil literature, which i studied during my<br />school days is, that, the ruthlessness is attributed to bravery.. A<br />brave man is aggressive..</p>
<p>But, i feel, there is large difference between the wars waged by us,<br />and the wars waged by the invaders.</p>
<p>I would like to know more on the following points..</p>
<p>1. Is the Wars were waged only between the kshatriyas, leaving the<br />common mass undisturbed?<br />Answer: Vijay had mentioned the Satyasriya's inscription of the <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  destroying his caste by taking away the women, killing children and everyone. Common man was always disturbed, common way raped, taken away, (Dr.JB had a thread on "vezham").</p>
<p>2. How was the political prisoners treated? Getting imprisoned is<br />different from getting looted, exploited, tortured and abused by the<br />enemy.<br />Answer: See the first answer. How would a person feel when his wife is taken away and made as a part of the prostitution ring? Vezham is another form where in women from enemy household are used as glorified sex-providers forthe victorious clan.</p>
<p>3. How was the relation b/w men &amp; women on those days... what i<br />understood is that, for the kshatriyas, the women captured in the war<br />belongs to only kshatriya caste, and not from common people.. <br />Answer: Refer to answer in 1.</p>
<p>4. The mughal invasion is characterised by full of hatred, and by the<br />policy of dar-ul-islam. . ie muslims and kafirs.. the kafirs are<br />either to be converted or to be destroyed.. so, their wars were<br />mostly of barbaric.. where, the entire civilisation is being destroyed..<br />But, i feel, our wars cannot be classified on par with them.. <br />Firstly, they may be ruthless... the palaces were destroyed.. the<br />defeated people were imprisoned. But, there is a basic level of<br />decency, and a raja dharma, where the prisoners were treated properly,<br />although they were used for most of the labour works.<br />Answer: Mughals started differently from the first muslim invasion, as theythemselves invaded Khilji and slave kingdom at delhi. There is no raja dharma when it comes to war. There is no victor in the entire history who would treat their vanquished subjects differently.</p>
<p>5. Did the molesting &amp; raping of women, done by all our kings or only<br />by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ? Does women from common masses are also affected?<br />Answer: Everyone does it. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was just following what was done before.</p>
<p>6. In Goa Inquisition, the dutch christians, unleashed all barbarism<br />on us.. for eg, the husband is tied to a pole, and his wife is raped<br />in front of him.. then the genitals of the husband is cut-down before<br />his wife. Then, his legs are tied to two bamboo poles, and then<br />released apart, where his body will teared in to two..<br />Answer: We have our own form of punishments, Kazhu-vetral, Koon pandiyan destroys Jainism in Pandya country, after the Jain priestly are defeated by Sambandar in the various vaathams. Dr.JB had posted a picture of the same from Madurai temple sometime back. I am not sure if the link is still active.</p>
<p>I feel, such level of barbarism could not have happened by our kings..<br />Beheading, killing by striking the chest are all held as virtues of<br />brave men, while stabbing from the back, running away from the war<br />field were considered as shameful acts..</p>
<p>We could not compare the political prisoners with slaves.. slaves<br />were treated cheaper than animals, while prisoners were treated with<br />some humanity..</p>
<p>so, my final conclusion is that "Ruthlessness is a characteristics of<br />war..But, barbarism is different from ruthlesness"</p>

<p>  Hi Raja,</p>
<p>  War is war - what else can it be - you come across instances of the <br />  ruthlessness of war in every day of the kurukshetra war. </p>
<p>  the problem is that we have been sold an image of RRC by kalki which <br />  is very hard to shake. Beleive me, get your hands on a copy of the <br />  mahavamsa ( the lankan chronicle).. ...slaves were taken even prior <br />  to rrc times. without going into detail there are accounts of <br />  lankans in large numbers ( in thousands) brought as slaves - again <br />  all this is speculation - karikalan is said to hv brought 12000 to <br />  build the kallanai. gaja bahu is said to hv come and liberated these <br />  and taken an equal number of tamils back....again contradicting <br />  accounts of this event come up.</p>
<p>  RJC not only recovered the pandya diadem but also the crown of <br />  lankan king, and not stopping at that - brought the king mahinda V <br />  and his queen and kept them under house arrest in madurai. the king <br />  died after 12 years in captivity in madurai.Anuradhapur a, the 1400-<br />  year-old capital of Sinhala kings was destroyed - The destruction <br />  was so extensive the city was abandoned. Cholas made the city of <br />  Polonnaruwa as their capital...</p>
<p>  According to the Hottur inscriptions of Satyasraya, dated 1007 – <br />  1008 C.E., the Chola king with a force numbering nine hundred <br />  thousand had `pillaged the whole country, had slaughtered the women, <br />  the children and the Brahmans, and, taking the girls to wife, had <br />  destroyed their caste' - this was a campaign personally led by RJC <br />  as a general under RRC.</p>
<p>  If you look further into RJC kedaram campagin and his war against <br />  sri vijaya - war trophies abound...so too are the number of war <br />  trophies that you see in GKC....the big temple itself is claimed to <br />  hv built with slave labour ( caputred armies)...Aditya claim to fame <br />  pandyan thalai konda - he is supposed to beheaded veerapandya and <br />  mounted the head on a bamboo pole and left it rotting outside <br />  tanjore for weeks....</p>

<p>Hi, we started the discussion by saying that there are two sides to <br />the coin. you are always reading one side - our side - the south <br />indian side. so when we were conquerers you read our version - which <br />shows us a noble etc etc. similarly when we were overrun you read our <br />version again, which says the invaders were hordes. thats why you <br />should study the other side. read the mahavamsam for the lankan view <br />of our incursions into their territory. similarly there are some <br />accounts of a persian poet who accompanied kafur - hear its not fully <br />translated yet - but someone attempted to do it to french first and <br />from french to english now. if i find out more will let you know - <br />there was absolutely no resistance offerred to his advance. similarly <br />on gazni - you read the accounts al biruni - our people were so sure <br />that their gods will deliver that they did not even think to fight <br />back. in that sense you could term us as cowards, backward tribe - <br />strictly from the invaders point of view - he must have found it <br />amuzing - so great a richness, treasure that was unimaginable just <br />handed to them on a plate - no gaurds, not even a sembalance of battle.</p>
<p>in this sense, we must take the words of poets with a pinch of salt - <br />like a gentle curves of a damsel are exaggerated in a bronze, so too <br />the poetic license of our court poets tend to sing praise adding some <br />frills...</p>
<p>but again hats off the poet - wether he exxagerated or not, the <br />thought was lofty</p>
<p>mandumarku udaithnan ayin, <br />unda en mulai aruthiduen, <br />yan, yenach sinaik, <br />konda valodu padupinam peyrach, <br />chengalam thuzhuvol, <br />sithainthuveragiya padumagan kidaikai kanuu, <br />enra nganrinum perithu uvanthanale..</p>
<p>If he had fled in the heat of battle,<br />she thundered in a rage, these breasts that nursed him<br />I'll tear to pieces. Sword in hand,<br />she groped around in the bloodstained field,<br />turning over one lifeless body<br />after another. When she found her son<br />lying prostrate, hacked to death,<br />she rejoiced more than on the day he was born.</p>

          Did RRC looted maldives and lanka, similar to britishers?        </div>

        <p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>War is Ruthless.. Its no doubt. Infact, from what i understood from<br />my little knowledge of our tamil literature, which i studied during my<br />school days is, that, the ruthlessness is attributed to bravery.. A<br />brave man is aggressive..</p>
<p>But, i feel, there is large difference between the wars waged by us,<br />and the wars waged by the invaders.</p>
<p>I would like to know more on the following points..</p>
<p>1. Is the Wars were waged only between the kshatriyas, leaving the<br />common mass undisturbed?</p>
<p>2. How was the political prisoners treated? Getting imprisoned is<br />different from getting looted, exploited, tortured and abused by the<br />enemy.</p>
<p>3. How was the relation b/w men &amp; women on those days... what i<br />understood is that, for the kshatriyas, the women captured in the war<br />belongs to only kshatriya caste, and not from common people..  </p>
<p>4. The mughal invasion is characterised by full of hatred, and by the<br />policy of dar-ul-islam.. ie muslims and kafirs.. the kafirs are<br />either to be converted or to be destroyed.. so, their wars were<br />mostly of barbaric.. where, the entire civilisation is being destroyed..<br />But, i feel, our wars cannot be classified on par with them..  <br />Firstly, they may be ruthless... the palaces were destroyed.. the<br />defeated people were imprisoned. But, there is a basic level of<br />decency, and a raja dharma, where the prisoners were treated properly,<br />although they were used for most of the labour works.</p>
<p>5. Did the molesting &amp; raping of women, done by all our kings or only<br />by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ? Does women from common masses are also affected?</p>
<p>6. In Goa Inquisition, the dutch christians, unleashed all barbarism<br />on us.. for eg, the husband is tied to a pole, and his wife is raped<br />in front of him.. then the genitals of the husband is cut-down before<br />his wife. Then, his legs are tied to two bamboo poles, and then<br />released apart, where his body will teared in to two..</p>
<p>I feel, such level of barbarism could not have happened by our kings..<br />Beheading, killing by striking the chest are all held as virtues of<br />brave men, while stabbing from the back, running away from the war<br />field were considered as shameful acts..</p>
<p>We could not compare the political prisoners with slaves.. slaves<br />were treated cheaper than animals, while prisoners were treated with<br />some humanity..</p>
<p>so, my final conclusion is that "Ruthlessness is a characteristics of<br />war..But, barbarism is different from ruthlesness"</p>

<p>  Hi Raja,</p>
<p>  War is war - what else can it be - you come across instances of the <br />  ruthlessness of war in every day of the kurukshetra war. </p>
<p>  the problem is that we have been sold an image of RRC by kalki which <br />  is very hard to shake. Beleive me, get your hands on a copy of the <br />  mahavamsa ( the lankan chronicle).....slaves were taken even prior <br />  to rrc times. without going into detail there are accounts of <br />  lankans in large numbers ( in thousands) brought as slaves - again <br />  all this is speculation - karikalan is said to hv brought 12000 to <br />  build the kallanai. gaja bahu is said to hv come and liberated these <br />  and taken an equal number of tamils back....again contradicting <br />  accounts of this event come up.</p>
<p>  RJC not only recovered the pandya diadem but also the crown of <br />  lankan king, and not stopping at that - brought the king mahinda V <br />  and his queen and kept them under house arrest in madurai. the king <br />  died after 12 years in captivity in madurai.Anuradhapura, the 1400-<br />  year-old capital of Sinhala kings was destroyed - The destruction <br />  was so extensive the city was abandoned. Cholas made the city of <br />  Polonnaruwa as their capital...</p>
<p>  According to the Hottur inscriptions of Satyasraya, dated 1007 ? <br />  1008 C.E., the Chola king with a force numbering nine hundred <br />  thousand had `pillaged the whole country, had slaughtered the women, <br />  the children and the Brahmans, and, taking the girls to wife, had <br />  destroyed their caste' - this was a campaign personally led by RJC <br />  as a general under RRC.</p>
<p>  If you look further into RJC kedaram campagin and his war against <br />  sri vijaya - war trophies abound...so too are the number of war <br />  trophies that you see in GKC....the big temple itself is claimed to <br />  hv built with slave labour ( caputred armies)...Aditya claim to fame <br />  pandyan thalai konda - he is supposed to beheaded veerapandya and <br />  mounted the head on a bamboo pole and left it rotting outside <br />  tanjore for weeks....</p>

<p>Temples were strictly off limits - thats why these edicts survived - <br />i guess the reason for carving the lengthly meeikirthi's on temple <br />walls ( most of them are simple endowments for lighting a anaiya <br />villaku or this vessel etc etc) - only the last couple of lines are <br />relevant to the endowment - rest 95% deal with the king's fame - was <br />to ensure that they survived for posterity. imagine the ignomity of <br />a king who sees his clan tranished by his opponent on a temple wall -<br />he couldnt touch it...he could melt the coins, destroy the palaces -<br />but he could do nothing with the temple edict. the donations also <br />survived , so did the wealth of the temples - they were the central <br />repository.... atleast till gazni in the north and kafur in the <br />south - decided to encash...</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sometimes reading the meykeertis in english makes it difficult to read. Is it possible to post such instances alone in tamil(unicode/tscii) while the rest of the mail remains in english!</p>

        <p>Dear Vijay</p>
<p>It is interesting to read this event. It is the same kulothinga III that built the sarabeshwarar temple (a simply superb temple, a very serene atmosphere after 6 pm) and restored thribuvanam temple along with many multitude of temples (also the kosai nagar (koyambedu) lava kusa temple). KIII time was when Kamban composed the epic. I have always been impressed by KIII's methods and works ...i guess except this one :-) <br />I am beginning to believe that these same dudes get totally different when the go for battle... revenge and vengence seem to have blotted their minds.</p>
<p>One thing though, I dont read either the pandyas or cholas burning down temples built by either. If any other instance please do share.</p>

<blockquote><p>  If it were true, that could possibly be one of the reasons why <br />many people do not talk or sing the praises of RJC and are proud of </p></blockquote>
<p>RRC. May be a reason why Kalki chose RRC too :-) </p>
<blockquote><p>  War is war - no question. But chola's administration was <br />different, check out their structures of taxing vs british. </p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>the cholas and pandyas feud runs for centuries. both of them <br />alternate in claiming the praise of severing the head of the other. <br />Would be nice to list out number of such kings.</p>
<p>i am reading an interesting book - Dr. Kudavoil Balasubramanian' s - <br />Gopura kalai marapu. An excellant repository of well researched <br />information neatly illustrated and indexed - a must read. Why i <br />mention it is, he cites the blood feud between the two as one of <br />reasons ( apart from our famed malik kafur) for lack of significant <br />palace / podium / victory arches etc in tamil land. two references <br />can be singled out- Kulottunga III on invading madurai - destroys <br />the pandya palace, the throne and grounds it to dust, not stopping <br />with that he ploughs it with a donkey and sows varagu!!! </p>
<p>not to be outdone, sundara pandian repays the cholas in the same <br />coin - while invading uraiyur and tanjore..... large building <br />complexes are set ablaze and he too destroys the chola <br />palace,throne - grounds it to dust, and ploughs it using a donkey <br />and sows varagu....</p>
<p>they also melted each others minted coins ( dont blame them - it <br />would have been humiliating to see the seated tiger looking at the <br />upright bow and the hanging fishes ( dead))</p>
<p>remember - the cholas pursued the pandya haram for two centuries and <br />occupied the better part of lanka just for it - the srilankan king <br />on his part refused to part with it despite all hardships..</p>
<p>on the chola/chera front - the very first sagasam of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is kandalur <br />salai where he takes the name of keralanthagan. ...he is said to set <br />ablaze the militiary academy at kandalur salai.</acronym></p>
<p>at that time, they must have spoken the same language,worshipped the <br />same gods, studied the same scriptures, wore similar clothes, their <br />people were of same color, creed.....yet the blood - drove them into <br />this feud. a case in point is <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  did try and merge the two clans - <br />but didnt succeed...</acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  War is war - no question. But chola's administration was <br />different, check out their structures of taxing vs british. </p>

<p>the cholas and pandyas feud runs for centuries. both of them <br />alternate in claiming the praise of severing the head of the other. <br />Would be nice to list out number of such kings.</p>
<p>i am reading an interesting book - Dr. Kudavoil Balasubramanian's - <br />Gopura kalai marapu. An excellant repository of well researched <br />information neatly illustrated and indexed - a must read. Why i <br />mention it is, he cites the blood feud between the two as one of <br />reasons ( apart from our famed malik kafur) for lack of significant <br />palace / podium / victory arches etc in tamil land. two references <br />can be singled out- Kulottunga III on invading madurai - destroys <br />the pandya palace, the throne and grounds it to dust, not stopping <br />with that he ploughs it with a donkey and sows varagu!!! </p>
<p>not to be outdone, sundara pandian repays the cholas in the same <br />coin - while invading uraiyur and tanjore.....large building <br />complexes are set ablaze and he too destroys the chola <br />palace,throne - grounds it to dust, and ploughs it using a donkey <br />and sows varagu....</p>
<p>they also melted each others minted coins ( dont blame them - it <br />would have been humiliating to see the seated tiger looking at the <br />upright bow and the hanging fishes ( dead))</p>
<p>remember - the cholas pursued the pandya haram for two centuries and <br />occupied the better part of lanka just for it - the srilankan king <br />on his part refused to part with it despite all hardships..</p>
<p>on the chola/chera front - the very first sagasam of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is kandalur <br />salai where he takes the name of keralanthagan....he is said to set <br />ablaze the militiary academy at kandalur salai.</acronym></p>
<p>at that time, they must have spoken the same language,worshipped the <br />same gods, studied the same scriptures, wore similar clothes, their <br />people were of same color, creed.....yet the blood - drove them into <br />this feud. a case in point is <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  did try and merge the two clans - <br />but didnt succeed...</acronym></p>

          Did RRC looted maldives and lanka, similar to britishers?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I had earlier mentioned about the hottur inscriptions on <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym . But one must wonder...why did the hosala kingdoms support the cholas till Rajaraja III reign ? Kinda sounds odd though, may be a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  more reading into that part ofdetail may help.</p>
<p>If it were true, that could possibly be one of the reasons why many people do not talk or sing the praises of <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  and are proud of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . May be a reason why Kalki chose <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  too :-) </p>
<p>War is war - no question. But chola's administration was different, check out their structures of taxing vs british. </p>
<p>And please...Kurukshetra is a total different story, I am sure we can discuss for months on that..as such people are feeling left out on the independance threads.. lets stick to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  :-) </p>

<p>Hi Raja,</p>
<p>War is war - what else can it be - you come across instances of the <br />ruthlessness of war in every day of the kurukshetra war. </p>
<p>the problem is that we have been sold an image of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  by kalki which <br />is very hard to shake. Beleive me, get your hands on a copy of the <br />mahavamsa ( the lankan chronicle).. ...slaves were taken even prior <br />to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  times. without going into detail there are accounts of <br />lankans in large numbers ( in thousands) brought as slaves - again <br />all this is speculation - karikalan is said to hv brought 12000 to <br />build the kallanai. gaja bahu is said to hv come and liberated these <br />and taken an equal number of tamils back....again contradicting <br />accounts of this event come up.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p><acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  not only recovered the pandya diadem but also the crown of <br />lankan king, and not stopping at that - brought the king mahinda V <br />and his queen and kept them under house arrest in madurai. the king <br />died after 12 years in captivity in madurai.Anuradhapur a, the 1400-<br />year-old capital of Sinhala kings was destroyed - The destruction <br />was so extensive the city was abandoned. Cholas made the city of <br />Polonnaruwa as their capital...</acronym></p>
<p>According to the Hottur inscriptions of Satyasraya, dated 1007 ? <br />1008 C.E., the Chola king with a force numbering nine hundred <br />thousand had `pillaged the whole country, had slaughtered the women, <br />the children and the Brahmans, and, taking the girls to wife, had <br />destroyed their caste' - this was a campaign personally led by <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  <br />as a general under <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .</p>
<p>If you look further into <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  kedaram campagin and his war against <br />sri vijaya - war trophies abound...so too are the number of war <br />trophies that you see in <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym ....the big temple itself is claimed to <br />hv built with slave labour ( caputred armies)...Aditya claim to fame <br />pandyan thalai konda - he is supposed to beheaded veerapandya and <br />mounted the head on a bamboo pole and left it rotting outside <br />tanjore for weeks....</acronym></acronym></p>
