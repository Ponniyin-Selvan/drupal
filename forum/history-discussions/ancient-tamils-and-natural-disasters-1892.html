</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I was reading the tsunami news with shock.Tamilnadu has faced a <br />devastating disaster.I also read the news in different media.No <br />media carried positive reports.All was negative.For eg..</p>
<p>Sun Tv--"TN govt failed to help tsunami victims.But central govt <br />only is helping."</p>
<p>Jaya TV--"people thank JJ for timely help"</p>
<p>Kumudam--This magazine curses sea.</p>
<p>vikatan--gives tales of tear and sorrow.Tells about fishermen who <br />have quit fishing and have gone inland.</p>
<p>lost everything sit and cry cursing sea and their fate.I dont blame <br />them.If I had lost my children and spouse in sea I would have done <br />exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>But I read in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  part 5 what kalki had said.He <br />said "people during chola days did not bother about floods.If they <br />lost a house in flood,they will rebuild it with vigour.Since <br />cholanadu had such valiant people chola kings could accomplish great <br />deeds"</acronym></p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  also narrates how paluvettarayar fought the <br />flood valiantly.At the age of 64 he defeated flood and came back <br />inspite of a tree and a building falling upon him.</acronym></p>
<p>That might be fiction.But i believe that this <br />is how our ancestors would have fought natural disaters.One thing <br />about our ancestors was sure.They werent afraid of death.</p>
<p>Malayaman says in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  "I had six sons who <br />equalled arjuna and bheema.I lost every one of them in wars.I never <br />cried when they died".was this old man afraid of death?</acronym></p>
<p>This attitude made our ancestors accomplish <br />great deeds.They very easily swallowed sorrows and deaths.They were <br />valiant and starred death face to face.They did not cry like our <br />media does today.</p>
<p>Japan has had various tsunami and earthquakes.It <br />even had 2 atom bomb attacks.But they did not sit and cry.They <br />rebuild their country with vigour.Recently when hurricane Ivan <br />attacked florida, people of florida did the same thing.American <br />media never carried such negative report which our media carries.Our <br />media carries this report only"everything is gone.all is <br />lost.finished..."</p>
<p>It seems that americans and japanese have the valiant nature which <br />our ancestors carried.we have lost it somewhere in the due course of <br />time.</p>
<p>This flood has attacked chola desam and pandya desam violently.But <br />these countries are famous for their valour.after being enslaved for <br />400 years pandyas recouped and defeated cholas after losing <br />everything.They had such valour.</p>
<p>Flood cannot destory our will.I read stories about fishermen <br />quitting their business and people waiting for govt aid(which will <br />never come).Lets take a leaf from our ancestors and face things <br />positively.why should fishermen quit thier business?are they afraid <br />of sea?</p>
<p>Let us face things positively.</p>

          Ancient tamils and natural disasters        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear kamal,<br />I am not heartless to say that people who lost everything in tsunami <br />should not cry.They are common men,like most of us.I would do the <br />same thing if i was an unfortunate victim.</p>
<p>I was only comparing the attitude of our current generation with <br />that of the past.You dont even have to go to the past to find out <br />how our ancestors faced death.You have to go 18 miles south of <br />rameshwaram-to vavuniya and yaalpaanam to see how our brethren there <br />face death.They face it more valiantly than us.There women and <br />children face death more bravely than the rest of the world.They are <br />equal to israelis and japanese in this aspect.</p>
<p>Current tamil generation in tamilnadu is not the heirs of warriors <br />like paluvettarayars,rajadithan,rajendran and malayaman.Only the <br />eelam tamils can claim to be their decendents.we dont have that <br />eligibility.</p>
<p>Our current priorities are washing cut outs of matineee idols with <br />milk and starting fan clubs for jothika and simran.we are no more a <br />civilization that produces great poets,warriors and businessmen.we <br />are a civilization that produces clerks,unemployed graduates <br />and "samanjadhu eppadi" type of poets.</p>
<p>when i see eelam tamils,when i see how they preserve their <br />language,how they produce valiant warriors like prabhakaran,charles <br />antony et al, about how they produce poets like kasi anadan--i <br />understand how our ancestors would have lived.</p>
<p>I would blame the media equally for this.Our mass media like <br />movies,journals,tv etc have castrated our youth.People like major <br />saravanan,abdul kalam are some cause for hope.</p>
<p>Its not only unique to tamilnadu.If we see current orissa,would we <br />believe that their ancestors were the great kalingas,who even <br />challenged the mighty asoka and krishnadeva raya?</p>
<p>If we see current biharis would we believe that their ancestors were <br />magadha kings like asoka and chandragupta mourya?</p>
<p>Telling such people about how their glorious past and illustrious <br />ancestors,about how they faced death and grief,is not heartless I <br />believe.</p>
<p>Tamil society will survive till eternity.But will it survive by <br />speaking english and forgeting tamil?will it have cinema idols as <br />its leader?If a civilization that had chief ministers like <br />anirudhar,sekhizar and kamarajar produces chief ministers like our <br />current lot and survives till eternity is that a cause for <br />celebration?</p>
<p>But eelam tamils will protect our civilization.There is no doubt <br />about it.</p>

<p>    I was reading the tsunami news with shock.Tamilnadu has faced a <br />    devastating disaster.I also read the news in different media.No <br />    media carried positive reports.All was negative.For eg..</p>
<p>    Sun Tv--"TN govt failed to help tsunami victims.But central govt <br />    only is helping."</p>
<p>    Jaya TV--"people thank JJ for timely help"</p>
<p>    Kumudam--This magazine curses sea.</p>
<p>    vikatan--gives tales of tear and sorrow.Tells about fishermen <br />who <br />    have quit fishing and have gone inland.</p>
<p>who <br />    lost everything sit and cry cursing sea and their fate.I dont <br />blame <br />    them.If I had lost my children and spouse in sea I would have <br />done <br />    exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>    But I read in PS part 5 what kalki had said.He <br />    said "people during chola days did not bother about floods.If <br />they <br />    lost a house in flood,they will rebuild it with vigour.Since <br />    cholanadu had such valiant people chola kings could accomplish <br />great <br />    deeds"</p>
<p>    PS also narrates how paluvettarayar fought <br />the <br />    flood valiantly.At the age of 64 he defeated flood and came back <br />    inspite of a tree and a building falling upon him.</p>
<p>    That might be fiction.But i believe that <br />this <br />    is how our ancestors would have fought natural disaters.One <br />thing <br />    about our ancestors was sure.They werent afraid of death.</p>
<p>    Malayaman says in PS "I had six sons who <br />    equalled arjuna and bheema.I lost every one of them in wars.I <br />never <br />    cried when they died".was this old man afraid of death?</p>
<p>    This attitude made our ancestors <br />accomplish <br />    great deeds.They very easily swallowed sorrows and deaths.They <br />were <br />    valiant and starred death face to face.They did not cry like our <br />    media does today.</p>
<p>    Japan has had various tsunami and <br />earthquakes.It <br />    even had 2 atom bomb attacks.But they did not sit and cry.They <br />    rebuild their country with vigour.Recently when hurricane Ivan <br />    attacked florida, people of florida did the same thing.American <br />    media never carried such negative report which our media <br />carries.Our <br />    media carries this report only"everything is gone.all is <br />    lost.finished..."</p>
<p>    It seems that americans and japanese have the valiant nature <br />which <br />    our ancestors carried.we have lost it somewhere in the due <br />course of <br />    time.</p>
<p>    This flood has attacked chola desam and pandya desam <br />violently.But <br />    these countries are famous for their valour.after being enslaved <br />for <br />    400 years pandyas recouped and defeated cholas after losing <br />    everything.They had such valour.</p>
<p>    Flood cannot destory our will.I read stories about fishermen <br />    quitting their business and people waiting for govt aid(which <br />will <br />    never come).Lets take a leaf from our ancestors and face things <br />    positively.why should fishermen quit thier business?are they <br />afraid <br />    of sea?</p>
<p>    Let us face things positively.</p>

        <p>I was some 6 Km away from Poompuhar when the tsunami struck.. Initially, there were very vague reports of disaster and vehicles were turned back..</p>
<p>On the way back to Mayavaram, I saw families walking with children, few possessions and even their cattle walking all the way away from the coast towards safety.. The scene was heart rendering. I was reminded of the destruction portrayed by Kalki in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  in the wake of the cyclone.. and his words about the resilience of the people.. I came to know of the extent of the disaster later..</p>
<p>He had written about the floods that once in a while Kaveri became very eager to join her lover "Samudhira rajan" and races towards him.. I guess that this time it was his turn.. </p>
<p>Times have changed.. but I believe that human nature is as resilient as ever.. I pray that people have the strength to rebuild their lives..</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi,</p>
<p>  A well written note. I remember reading about an observation of Ravi<br />  Bernard (TV anchor) when he visited Israel. Even when there was a<br />  suicide attack on a bus the previous day, a popular news paper in<br />  Israel devoted major real estate on its front page to cover the good<br />  farming practices invented by a local farmer. The death toll and<br />  details about the attack was a small news item tucked away in a<br />  corner.</p>
<p>  I just finished reading the first two volumes of Udaiyar written by<br />  Balakumaran. Given how deeply Raja Raja was entrenched, it must have<br />  required valiant effort and motivation over generations by Pandiyars<br />  to win back their kingdom. The degradation in quality of kings after<br />  Rajendra could have contributed but we still cannot take away the<br />  credit from the Pandiyars. Rightly said that we need to learn from our<br />  ancestors.</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>A well written note. I remember reading about an observation of Ravi<br />Bernard (TV anchor) when he visited Israel. Even when there was a<br />suicide attack on a bus the previous day, a popular news paper in<br />Israel devoted major real estate on its front page to cover the good<br />farming practices invented by a local farmer. The death toll and<br />details about the attack was a small news item tucked away in a<br />corner.</p>
<p>I just finished reading the first two volumes of Udaiyar written by<br />Balakumaran. Given how deeply Raja Raja was entrenched, it must have<br />required valiant effort and motivation over generations by Pandiyars<br />to win back their kingdom. The degradation in quality of kings after<br />Rajendra could have contributed but we still cannot take away the<br />credit from the Pandiyars. Rightly said that we need to learn from our<br />ancestors.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Siva</p>
