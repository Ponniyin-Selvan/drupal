</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi<br />all jewish, muslim and christian mythologies record a great flood. <br />some go into detail about 40 days of rain. and how god asked noah to <br />build an ark.<br />animals canme by two by two . hurrah.. goes the song. most of these I <br />beleive came from mesopotamian mentions of a great flood.</p>
<p>we should discuss similar mentions in hinduism.</p>
<p>the macha aathar and the cosmic flod is one.<br />the other i can think of is depicted in sirkali with shiva being the <br />thoniappar who ferried mankind to safety.<br />can somebody throw more light on these floods.<br />venketesh</p>

        <p>It is our problem and more of a problem with our self<br />esteem. There are very few saints, because it is so<br />difficult to be a true saint. True saints rarely<br />advertise or perform 'magic'. Ultimately God is within<br />us, we have to have courage to believe that. </p>
<p>A major part of the impetus for the atheistic movement<br />in TN to survive is belief of people in all magic and<br />fake swamis, instead of true self seeking<br />spirituality. Some people talk of Kalki like<br />christians talk of 'second coming', like there is some<br />big answer to the world's problems and it can end like<br />that. There may be, but really that is a little<br />escapist type of thinking to me. The only difference<br />is what difference we make, each and every one of us.<br />Or like Mother Teresa says we cannot do big things we<br />can only do small things in a big way.</p>

<blockquote><p>  If we are not able to find who is real and dupe, it<br />  is our problem,<br />  not dupe's. There is no point in blaming these<br />  dupes. My college<br />  correspondent brought Premanandra Maharaj (!),<br />  opened a block and<br />  didn't allow us to wear shoes/chappel when we enter<br />  inside and his<br />  name is inscribed outside of the block. If this is<br />  the case of<br />  correspondent, then think about ordinary people, all<br />  these because he<br />  took lingam from his mouth.</p>

<p>Ravi, very interesting points of view!! I agree<br />completely with you that the asuras cannot be compared<br />to Hitler, matter of fact very few of them could even<br />be classified as 'evil' all their acts were very<br />subjective, and that is often times what makes God's<br />reactions very difficult to understand. Ravana was a<br />great ruler, which is the reason why Sri Rama gives<br />him 'one more day' - indru poi naalai vaa. Duryodhana<br />was not 'evil' as we think, he was showered flowers<br />when he died. Sakuni was avenging the death of his<br />brothers by corrupting his mind. There is no evidence<br />that Duryodhana and Kauravas were bad rulers or mis<br />treated their subjects in any way.</p>
<p>I find the Prahlada story inspiring among all since<br />Prahlada was a child and what was done to him was<br />child abuse. The other avatars are difficult to<br />justify from present day perspective. I think good and<br />evil are strongly dependant on cultures and living<br />standards of any given time. Even <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and Narasimha<br />Pallava, great rulers as eulogised by Kalki had strong<br />elements of subjectivity to their 'goodness', we have<br />to forgive or ignore their acts of bloodshed and wars<br />if we have to respect them.</acronym></p>
<p>So even if God wants to come as Kalki, only He can<br />perhaps understand why. One man's hero is definitely<br />another man's villain, not just in our times, even as<br />far behind as Ramayana. (In the Thai version of<br />Ramayana Ravana is the hero, to this day).</p>

<p>  When there is a negative soul (or a collection as in<br />  Kauravas) that <br />  generates the energy to control elements of earth<br />  and other planets / <br />  their influences on our worlds, that is when a<br />  larger cosmic energy <br />  will balance the act.</p>
<p>  That is not possible for us to imagine in our meagre<br />  knowledge of the <br />  Almighty in His full flow.

<p>  My thought process (may be a bit biassed with<br />  religious materials), <br />  fails to hail a person like hitler to equal with<br />  Kamsa or sooran etc. <br />  Physical damage hitler did create, a soul like<br />  Sooran was a staunch <br />  siva bhaktan, he generated so much of energy and<br />  soul power to rule <br />  for thousands of years across so many galaxies. I<br />  doubt if a person <br />  like hitler even had one micro granule of such soul<br />  power. Such was <br />  the soul power of Suran - Tharakasuran - Sihamukan <br />  that Skanda toyed <br />  around with him for 7 days (cosmic days may be equal<br />  to so many light <br />  years) to show the Devas the power of Paramasivan' s<br />  powers given to <br />  His devotee, in fact by the second day, Devas almost<br />  think that Suran <br />  is a greater force than the Supreme Himself. We all<br />  know how it ends <br />  however.</p>
<p>  Anyway, long story short, these low faced criminals<br />  have no great <br />  soul power to match the calibre of the Anti hero's<br />  in Asuras. <br />  Anti hero is because, the increase their power not<br />  by mayic force but <br />  breaking that shield and attaining boons by austere<br />  penances. I am <br />  yet to see or hear such force for another flooded<br />  massive cosmic <br />  manifestation. Well, Lord Kalki is due so lets hope<br />  that He does not <br />  need to show up for a few of our younger<br />  generations.</p>

<p>      911 or WII or any such similar instances (Iraq<br />  war, Kargil etc), <br />    are <br />      various ways in which pralayams happen, they not<br />  necessarily mean <br />      water in flood, flood is a term for catastrophe.</p>
<p>      Krsna's yda yadahi dharmasya practically means<br />  balance of nature, <br />    you <br />      can witness it every walk of life. The maha<br />  pralayams are ones <br />    when <br />      it takes an eternal cosmic energy to balance the<br />  universe in a <br />    large <br />      form of manifestation.</p>
<p>      Surapadman, practically controlled every law of<br />  nature as did <br />    Ravana <br />      or other asuras who took over. Man to come to<br />  that stand will <br />  take <br />    a <br />      long time. When that (Forcing nature to act<br />  against her ways) <br />    happens <br />      the larger cosmic energy will manifest and flood<br />  the universe to <br />      restore His favourite game.<br />      Narasimha avatar, prior to the single combat<br />  came to a stage <br />  where <br />      the Lord manifested himself in every atom across<br />  the cosmos, for <br />    want <br />      of the child to point anywhere, it was<br />  Hiranyakashipu' s bad time <br />    or <br />      egoistical arrogance forcing him to show his own<br />  jayasthambam he <br />    made <br />      with his own hands in the center of the court..<br />  THe fact that Lord <br />      sits in every single atom waiting to equate the<br />  universe makes it <br />    a <br />      cosmic flood.</p>
<p>      These are various instances of cosmic floods,<br />  Chandi fusing <br />    herself <br />      in every atom to drink the ounce of blood<br />  falling from Mahisha <br />  was <br />      cosmic flood. Skanda hunting down surapadma in<br />  all the lokas in <br />      various forms - happend as the Lord flooded the<br />  universe with his <br />      shakthi. </p>
<p>      Maha pralayams are way beyond our imagination<br />  especially if we <br />      believe in the western ideologies and science to<br />  factor with <br />    limited <br />      knowledge. Other balance of nature will happen<br />  as and when it is <br />      destined where Mother earth and her subordinates<br />  will be able to <br />      fight back, it takes a subtle difference in<br />  thought process to <br />    think <br />      out of the box solutions to the query.</p>

          the flood in hindu mythology        </div>

        <p>Dear Malathi, I agree to your statement however, i still feel a <br />person of Hitler's magnitude or Osama's magnitude or industries <br />polluting rivers and global warming etc - will fall into the smaller <br />pralayam.</p>
<p>When there is a negative soul (or a collection as in Kauravas) that <br />generates the energy to control elements of earth and other planets / <br />their influences on our worlds, that is when a larger cosmic energy <br />will balance the act.</p>
<p>That is not possible for us to imagine in our meagre knowledge of the <br />Almighty in His full flow. The closest we can imagine is Lord Rama's <br />passage on earth.<br />How would we be able to imagine an earth bare of water dried up by <br />the Lord's spear? Yes - if you think only from a factor of spiritual <br />plane, that is easily deduced to Oceans of 7 samsaric births as <br />humans, physical plans - there is no law of physics that can explain <br />it. </p>
<p>My thought process (may be a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  biassed with religious materials), <br />fails to hail a person like hitler to equal with Kamsa or sooran etc. <br />Physical damage hitler did create, a soul like Sooran was a staunch <br />siva bhaktan, he generated so much of energy and soul power to rule <br />for thousands of years across so many galaxies. I doubt if a person <br />like hitler even had one micro granule of such soul power. Such was <br />the soul power of Suran - Tharakasuran - Sihamukan that Skanda toyed <br />around with him for 7 days (cosmic days may be equal to so many light <br />years) to show the Devas the power of Paramasivan's powers given to <br />His devotee, in fact by the second day, Devas almost think that Suran <br />is a greater force than the Supreme Himself. We all know how it ends <br />however.</acronym></p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, these low faced criminals have no great <br />soul power to match the calibre of the Anti hero's in Asuras. <br />Anti hero is because, the increase their power not by mayic force but <br />breaking that shield and attaining boons by austere penances. I am <br />yet to see or hear such force for another flooded massive cosmic <br />manifestation. Well, Lord Kalki is due so lets hope that He does not <br />need to show up for a few of our younger generations.</p>

          the flood in hindu mythology        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Man is an integral part of nature, how nature cycles and recyles <br />itself using various components of itself is the key to understanding <br />Lord's larger frame. </p>
<p>911 or WII or any such similar instances (Iraq war, Kargil etc), are <br />various ways in which pralayams happen, they not necessarily mean <br />water in flood, flood is a term for catastrophe. </p>
<p>Krsna's yda yadahi dharmasya practically means balance of nature, you <br />can witness it every walk of life. The maha pralayams are ones when <br />it takes an eternal cosmic energy to balance the universe in a large <br />form of manifestation.</p>
<p>Surapadman, practically controlled every law of nature as did Ravana <br />or other asuras who took over. Man to come to that stand will take a <br />long time. When that (Forcing nature to act against her ways) happens <br />the larger cosmic energy will manifest and flood the universe to <br />restore His favourite game.<br />Narasimha avatar, prior to the single combat came to a stage where <br />the Lord manifested himself in every atom across the cosmos, for want <br />of the child to point anywhere, it was Hiranyakashipu's bad time or <br />egoistical arrogance forcing him to show his own jayasthambam he made <br />with his own hands in the center of the court. THe fact that Lord <br />sits in every single atom waiting to equate the universe makes it a <br />cosmic flood.</p>
<p>These are various instances of cosmic floods, Chandi fusing herself <br />in every atom to drink the ounce of blood falling from Mahisha was <br />cosmic flood. Skanda hunting down surapadma in all the lokas in <br />various forms - happend as the Lord flooded the universe with his <br />shakthi. </p>
<p>Maha pralayams are way beyond our imagination especially if we <br />believe in the western ideologies and science to factor with limited <br />knowledge. Other balance of nature will happen as and when it is <br />destined where Mother earth and her subordinates will be able to <br />fight back, it takes a subtle difference in thought process to think <br />out of the box solutions to the query.</p>

<p>    The larger ones (maha) happen when yugams end. Dwaraka was one. <br />  Rama <br />    walking into Sarayu is another, Muruga drying up entire 7 oceans <br />  in <br />    quest of surapadma etc, macha avatar is a part of one such large <br />  one.</p>

        <p>Ravi, to me it does not matter if Krishna was<br />'physical' or not. Matter of fact the more we want to<br />see all these things like present day/in movies etc<br />the more of a hurdle it is to spiritual progress. </p>
<p>The Mahabharat by the way is not a simple 'good over<br />evil' story as this movie shows or other movies show.<br />All the pandavas after they die go to hell. Duryodhana<br />is found in heaven, along with Karna and some others.<br />The consequences of what each person did manifests in<br />many different ways. To me whether there is a physical<br />'pralayam' or not is less important than whether there<br />is individual consequences which make it compelling to<br />live according to our dharma.</p>

        <p>Thanks. My take on the Mahabharat and especially the<br />Gita is that it is an allegorical war, not a real one.<br />This was a great movie, no offence to that but I dont'<br />believe the war and the message of the Gita was so<br />literal, it is a lot more deeper and personal than<br />that.</p>
