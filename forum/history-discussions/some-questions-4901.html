</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>1) why did <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  shift his capital to <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  from Tanjore?</p>
<p>(can we draw a parallel with nero - seeing the congested rome had it <br />burned down to create a grand city....again lot of speculation on <br />this..RJC not wanting to lay waste his fathers work decides to <br />create something fresh)</p>
<p>2) the pallavas built the shore temple around 7th/8th C in stone. <br />why then did we have to wait for 2 more C's for Uttama/Sembian <br />madevi to convert the brick works to stone..the two seem to have <br />accomplished the task in a short span ( 15 years??)</p>
<p>3)is mamallapuram a finished work? to me the varied styles and half <br />finished works more resemble a sculture school where apprentices <br />practise different forms of stone work...why were bulk of the work <br />left half done ....vacated in haste. was it due to pulikesi's <br />invasion as written by kalki - if so why didnt the later pallava's <br />continue the work</p>
<p>4) why do we always talk of chola/chera and pandya as south indian <br />kings - mumudi chola etc.....why pallavas are discounted</p>
<p>5) similarly why we never hear of the kalabhras who ruled for a <br />considerable period form the thid C to the late 6th century - King <br />Achchutavikranta of the Kalabharakula ( buddist !!), as ruling over <br />the Chola country from Kaveripatnam - who kept the Chera, Chola and <br />Pandya king in captivity. </p></acronym></p>

        <p>in the article, they interpret rayalaseema as land of<br />kings (rajasthan). i think seema is closer to<br />'border'; rayalaseema may be taken to mean "kingdom's<br />border". is this right?</p>

<p>  Mudi + Raja =  Mudiraja<br />  Muthu + Raja =  Muthuraja <br />  Mudiraja &lt;=  Muthuraja<br />  Mudirajas &lt;- Kalabhras &lt;- Kalchuris (Indoaryans) &lt;-<br />  Aryans </p>
<p>  (1) the descendancy of Mudiraj people from Kalabhra<br />  kings who <br />  migrated to South of South India from land of Telugu<br />  speaking <br />  Rayalaseema Region of Andhra Pradesh and later<br />  changed their <br />  religion from Jainism to Buddhism,</p>
<p>  (2) The roots of Kalabhras to Indo-Aryan kings of<br />  Kalachuris <br />  (Kalchuris) of Central India with religious<br />  favouritism to Jainism &amp; <br />  Shaivism, and </p>
<p>  (3) The Aryan connection of Kalchuris of Mahishmati<br />  &amp; Tripuri of <br />  Central India and their relation to Sri Krishna,<br />  Sishupal, &amp; <br />  Sahasrarjuna and Separation of Aryan kshatriyas from<br />  Aryan Brahmins <br />  by accepting Indian religious path of Shaivism in<br />  which Shiva was <br />  the first JINA.</p>
<p>  Historians believe that Mutharaiyars (Mudirajas) are<br />  the descendants <br />  of Kalabhras and Kalabhras were the people of great<br />  warrior race, <br />  who infested the uplands Karnataka (Hampi Region),<br />  and Thirupathi <br />  (Vengadam) Hills. The areas of Hampi and Thirupathi<br />  hills were part <br />  of Dandakaaranya in Deccan India, which had a<br />  mention in the great <br />  Sanskrit epic Ramayana written by sage Valmiki.<br />  Historians have also <br />  identified several kings of South Indian origin<br />  belonging to various <br />  clans as the descendants of great warriors Kalabhra<br />  race.</p>
<p>  Mudirajus (Muthurajas) were the descendants of<br />  Kalabhras: The <br />  Mutharaiyars of Kondubalur (8th to 11th Century AD)<br />  are believed to <br />  be the descendants of the mighty warrior race of<br />  Kalabhras. Some <br />  historians regard that Kalabhras were a predatory<br />  people belonging <br />  to the uplands of Karnataka (Hampi Region =  Pampa<br />  Region) on the <br />  strength of a reference in Tamil literature to the<br />  rule of a Karnata <br />  king over Madura. The various names used to refer<br />  these people of " <br />  Raja / Raya / Racha " ruling class are as given<br />  below: </p>
<p>  Mudiraja =  Muthuraja =  Mutharacha <br />  Mutharacha =  Mutharaya =  Mutharaiyar <br />  Mutharacha =  Mutharasa =  Mutharasu =  Mutharasi <br />  Mutharaiyar =  Muttiriyar =  Muttiris <br />  Mutharaiyar =  Muthariyar =  Mudaliyar <br />  The uplands of Karnataka constitute the entire<br />  region of Bellary <br />  Districts. Bellary districts were once an integral<br />  part of undivided <br />  Rayalaseema in ANDHRA STATE, which was formed<br />  immediately after the <br />  first reorganization of states on the basis of<br />  languages in <br />  independent India. </p>
<p>  The Bellary districts were originally a Telugu<br />  speaking region since <br />  unknown times and were an integral part of erstwhile<br />  Rayalaseema of <br />  Andhra Pradesh. These Bellary districts were given<br />  to the then <br />  Mysore State by Andhra State in exchange for some<br />  other districts <br />  for some administrative reasons. The Rayalaseema<br />  Region of South <br />  India gave birth to a host of great RAYA kings, who<br />  wiliingly laid <br />  down their lives to protect the Hindus and Hinduism<br />  from the <br />  onslaught of Muslim invaders and Rayalaseema was<br />  comparable to the <br />  great Rajasthan of North India. </p>
<p>  Racha =  Raya =  Raja =  King<br />  Mandalam =  Seema =  Sthan =  Land (Region)<br />  Rayalaseema =  Rajathan =  Land of kings or Land of<br />  kings community</p>
<p>  Who were the kalabhras ?</p>
<p>  Kalabhras were misterious warrior people of South<br />  India whose <br />  origins are not known to historians. No body knows<br />  for certain, from <br />  where they came into South Indian peninsula to upset<br />  and uproot the <br />  Adhirajas of Chera, Chola and Pandya dynasties who<br />  were ruling the <br />  lands of present day Tamilnadu and Kerala state.<br />  Every historian <br />  tried their best to throw some light on these<br />  valiant and powerful <br />  rulers with what ever little evidences they managed<br />  to gather from <br />  known historical sources. </p>
<p>  The only sources available to the historians are the<br />  jain and <br />  buddhist literature. The kalabhras ruled South<br />  Indian peninsula for <br />  about 300 years which is not a small time from the<br />  point of history <br />  but the history of this kalabhra period was<br />  completely a dark <br />  chapter. So the period of kalabhra rule in South<br />  Indian history was <br />  termed by historians as "DARK AGE". <br />  It is believed that the brahmins, who were treated<br />  very badly by the <br />  kalbhra kings by snatching away the rights of<br />  brahmins over the <br />  brahmadeya lands given to them and to their Hindu<br />  Gods, got <br />  antagonised. It is said that the brahmin<br />  epigraphists either <br />  distroyed the history of kalabhras or twisted it<br />  beyond normal <br />  understanding of common people. Some historians said<br />  that they were <br />  the kings who brought Jainism to Tamil country and<br />  some other <br />  historians were of the view that they were buddhists<br />  during whose <br />  rule buddhism flourished in South India. Though<br />  historians are found <br />  to have various openions about these misterious<br />  warrior and ruling <br />  class people, they all agreed on one common thing<br />  about the <br />  kalabhras that they were verile, ferocious, terrible<br />  and ruthless <br />  conquerors.</p>
<p>  Prof., Ramaswami Ayangar asserts :</p>
<p>  Many Pallava and Pandya writings describe that the<br />  Kalabhras <br />  attacked the Tamil country and defeated the Cholas,<br />  Cheras and <br />  Pandyas and established their kingdom. Prof.,<br />  Ramaswami Ayangar <br />  asserts that these valiant Kalabhra kings were the<br />  devoted followers <br />  of Jainism. Basically, Kalchuri kings were<br />  supporters <br />=== message truncated ===</p></blockquote>

<p>Who were the kalabhras ?</p>
<p>Kalabhras were misterious warrior people of South India whose <br />origins are not known to historians. No body knows for certain, from <br />where they came into South Indian peninsula to upset and uproot the <br />Adhirajas of Chera, Chola and Pandya dynasties who were ruling the <br />lands of present day Tamilnadu and Kerala state. Every historian <br />tried their best to throw some light on these valiant and powerful <br />rulers with what ever little evidences they managed to gather from <br />known historical sources. </p>
<p>The only sources available to the historians are the jain and <br />buddhist literature. The kalabhras ruled South Indian peninsula for <br />about 300 years which is not a small time from the point of history <br />but the history of this kalabhra period was completely a dark <br />chapter. So the period of kalabhra rule in South Indian history was <br />termed by historians as "DARK AGE". <br />It is believed that the brahmins, who were treated very badly by the <br />kalbhra kings by snatching away the rights of brahmins over the <br />brahmadeya lands given to them and to their Hindu Gods, got <br />antagonised. It is said that the brahmin epigraphists either <br />distroyed the history of kalabhras or twisted it beyond normal <br />understanding of common people. Some historians said that they were <br />the kings who brought Jainism to Tamil country and some other <br />historians were of the view that they were buddhists during whose <br />rule buddhism flourished in South India. Though historians are found <br />to have various openions about these misterious warrior and ruling <br />class people, they all agreed on one common thing about the <br />kalabhras that they were verile, ferocious, terrible and ruthless <br />conquerors.</p>
<p>Prof., Ramaswami Ayangar asserts :</p>
<p>Many Pallava and Pandya writings describe that the Kalabhras <br />attacked the Tamil country and defeated the Cholas, Cheras and <br />Pandyas and established their kingdom. Prof., Ramaswami Ayangar <br />asserts that these valiant Kalabhra kings were the devoted followers <br />of Jainism. Basically, Kalchuri kings were supporters of Jainism. He <br />proved it on the basis of copper plate of Veluikudi and <br />Painyapuranam of Tamil language. Jainism flourished after their <br />reaching in Tamil country. Shri Ayangar presumes that these <br />Kalabhras were a branch of Kalchuri clan. The Kalchuri kings of M.P. <br />wore supporters of Jainism. The evidence on this is that they were <br />closely related to Rashtrakuta. The Rashtrakuta kings had their <br />faith in Jainism. The influence of Jainism during reign of Kalchuri <br />kings of Kalyani was perceptible. The prominent king Vijjala of this <br />clan and his several statesmen had adopted Jainism. Rechmayya, the <br />minister of Kalchuri State set up the image of Tirthankar Shantinath <br />at Shravanabelagola. </p>
<p>Dr. Aiyangar observes: </p>
<p>"The Andhra rulers...had an alternative capital in the basin of <br />lower Krishna at Amaravati wherefrom they stretched south wards, <br />and, perhaps at one time, made an effort to extend their authority <br />successfully even down to the southern Pennar..." The gradual <br />pressure from the Andhra Empire seems to have set up a popular <br />movement resulting in the migration of the somewhat less civilized <br />people who seem to have completely upset the Governments of South <br />India and introduced what may well be regarded as a period of <br />anarchy to which later inscriptions refer to in unmistakable terms. <br />This is the movement of the people called Kalvar or Kalavar, and <br />they must have moved down from the region round and about Vengadam, <br />if not from the whole of Tondamandalam. ..." Kalabhras fought <br />against Brahmin supremacy and were abused by Brahmin epigraphists <br />after their rule ended. </p>
<p>Shri K.A.N. Sastri has the following to say about them: </p>
<p>"A long historical night ensure after the close of the Sangam age. <br />We know little of the period of more than three centuries that <br />followed. When the curtain rises again towards the close of the <br />sixth century A.D., we find a mysterious and ubiquitous enemy of <br />civilization, the evil rulers called Kalabhras (Kalappalar), have <br />come and upset the established political order which was restored <br />only by their defeat at the hands of the Pandyas and Pallavas as <br />well as the Chalukyas of Badami. </p>
<p>Of the Kalabhras we have yet no definite knowledge; from some <br />Buddhist books we hear of a certain Acchutavikkanta of the <br />Kalabharakula during whose reign Buddhist monasteries and authors <br />enjoyed most patronage in the Chola country. Late literary tradition <br />in Tamil avers that he kept in confinement the three Tamil kings - <br />the Chera, Chola and Pandya. Some songs about him are quoted by <br />Amitasagara, a Jain grammarian of Tamil of the tenth century A.D. <br />Possibly Acchuta was himself a Buddhist, a political revolution <br />which the Kalabhras effected was provoked by religious antagonism.</p>
<p>At any rate the Kalabhras are roundly denounced as evil king (kali-<br />arasar) who uprooted many adhirajas and abrogated brahmdeya rights; <br />there was no love lost between these interlopers and the people of <br />the lands they overran. The Cholas disappeared from the Tamil land <br />almost completely in this debacle, though a branch of them can be <br />tranced towards the close of the period in Rayalaseema, the Telugu <br />Cholas, whose kingdom is mentioned by Yuan Chwang in the seventh <br />century A.D.". </p>
<p>" The upset of the existing order due to the Kalabhras must have <br />affected the Chera country as well, though there is little evidence <br />on this country in this period apart from the late legend of the <br />Keralotpatti and Keralamahatyam. According to these, the rulers of <br />the land had to be imported from neighbouring countries, and they <br />assumed the title of Perumal. Possibly the Vaishnava saint <br />Kulasekhara Alvar was one of these Perumals; in his poems he claims <br />sovereignty over Chera, Chola and Pandya, besides the Kongu country <br />and Kolli mountain. His age cannot be determined with any certainty, <br />though a date as early as the sixth century has been suggested for <br />him, on the ground that at no later period could this claim to rule <br />over Pandya and Chola be plausible. It seems more likely, however, <br />that this claim was merely rhetorical, and that he belonged to a <br />much later time, say ninth century A.D.".</p>
<p>"This dark period marked by the ascendancy of Buddhism, and probably <br />also Jainism, was characterized also by great literary activity in <br />Tamil. Most of the works grouped under the head, 'The Eighteen Minor <br />works' were written during this period as also the Silappadhikaran, <br />Manimekhalai and other works. Many of the authors were the votaries <br />of the `heretical' (meaning Buddhists and Jains) sects." </p>
<p>Kalabhras were Buddhists: </p>
<p>About these so called `wicked' Kalabhras, R. Sathinathaier observes; </p>
<p>"We have already made a few references to the Kalabhras, and to <br />their king Achchutavikranta. The Velvikudi plates of the third <br />regnal year of Ndunjadaiyan Pandya (c.765 - c.815) say that <br />Palyagamudukudumi - Peruvaludi Pandyadhiraja gave the village of <br />Velvikudi as brahmadeya (gift to a brahmana). It was enjoyed for <br />long. Then a Kali king named Kalabhran took possession of the <br />extensive earth, driving away numberless great kings (adiraja), and <br />resumed the (village mentioned) above.</p>
<p>After that...the Pandyadhiraja Kodungon recovered the territory <br />under the Kalabhra occupation. It would appear from the brief <br />account that the Pandya country was seized by the Kalabhras long <br />after Mudukudumi. They overthrew many adhirajas and resumed even <br />brahmdeya lands. Thus they were terrible and ruthless conquerors. <br />Their sway was put an end to by Kodungon, who may be assigned <br />conjecturally to c.590 - 620. There are other references to the <br />Kalabhras in Pallava and Chalukya inscriptions; they are said to <br />have been conquered by Simhavishnu and Narasimha Varman-I and by <br />Vikramaditya-I and II." </p>
<p>"The identification of the Kalabhras is very difficult problem of <br />South Indian History. (i) They have been identified with the line of <br />Muttaraiyar of Kondubalur (8 A.D to 11 A.D). (ii) Others regard them <br />as Karnatas on the strength of a reference in Tamil literature to <br />the rule of a Karnata king over Madura. (iii) A third view is that <br />the Kalabhras were Kalappalar, belonging to Vellala community and <br />referred to in Tamil literature and inscriptions. </p>
<p>But the most satisfactory theory identifies the Kalabhras with the <br />Kalavar, and the chieftains of this tribe mentioned in Sangam <br />literature are Tiraiyan of Pavattiri and Pulli of Vengadam or <br />Tirupati. The latter is described as the cattle lifting robber chief <br />of the frontier. The Kalavar must have been dislodged from their <br />habitat near Tirupati by political events of the 3 A.D., viz. the <br />fall of the Satvahanas and the rise of Pallavas, as well as by the <br />invasion of Dakshinapatha by Samudragupta in the following century, <br />resulting in political confusion in Tondamandalam. The Kalabhra <br />invasion must have overwhelmed the Pallavas, the Cholas and the <br />Pandyas." </p>
<p>Kalabhras =  kalabars =  Kalavar =  kalvar<br />kalavar &lt;=  kalappalar =  kalappirar </p>
<p>"Despite the various explanations given above, the Kalabhras cannot <br />but be regarded as mysterious people who convulsed the affairs of <br />the Tamil country for a few centuries. Achchutavikranta caused the <br />dispersal of the Cholas. In the Pandya country even brahmdeya gifts <br />were not treated as sacrosanct by the predatory Kalabhras. <br />Ultimately their power was broken by Kodungon Pandya and Simhavishnu <br />Pallava, and Chalukya campaigns against them in the 7 A.D and 8 A.D" </p>
<p>" The Muttaraiyar and Kodunabnalar chiefs of Kalabhra origin, <br />according to one view, were feudatory to the Pallavas and the <br />Pandyas respectively, and in the contest between two powers, they <br />fought on opposite sides. The Muttaraiyar ruled over Tanjore and <br />Pudukkotai as the feudatories of the Pallavas from the 8 A.D to 11 <br />A.D. There is a reference to Perumbidugu - Muttaraiyan- II who <br />attended the coronation of Nandivarman Pallavamlla. One of the <br />titles of the Muttaraiyar was Lord of Tanjore. Vijayalaya Chola, who <br />conquered Tanjore from a Muttaraiyan in the 9 A.D., was a Pallava <br />feudatory. A vindication of the law of nemesis is discernible in the <br />victory of a Chola chief over a descendant of the Kalabhras who had <br />overthrown the earlier Chola kingdom." </p>
<p>" The history of Cholas of Uraiyur (near Trichinoply) is exceedingly <br />obscure from 4 A.D to 9 A.D., chiefly owing to the occupation of <br />their country by the Kalabhras. Buddhadatta, the great writer in <br />Pali, belonged to Uraiyur. He mentions his contemporary, King <br />Achchutavikranta of the Kalabharakula, as ruling over the Chola <br />country from Kaveripatnam. He was a Buddhist, Tamil literary <br />tradition refers to an Achchuta who kept the Chera, Chola and Pandya <br />king in captivity. On the basis of the contemporaneity of Buddhdatta <br />with Buddhaghosha, Achchuta may be assigned to the 5 A.D. Thus after <br />the Sangam age, the descendants of karikala Chola were forced into <br />obscurity by the Kalabhras, who disturbed the placid political <br />conditions of the Tamil country." </p>
<p>Woraiyur , a part of present day Tiruchirappalli, was the capital <br />city of Cholas from 300 B.C. onwards. This is supported by <br />archaeological evidences and ancient literatures. There are also <br />literary sources which tell that Woraiyur continued to be under the <br />control of Cholas even during the days of Kalabhra interregnum (A.D. <br />300 - 575). </p>
<p>According to 'Chulavamsa', Buddhadatta and Budhaghosa are certainly <br />represented as contamporaries. The formar belongs to Uragapura <br />[Uraiyur] near modern Trichinopoly in South India. He himself speaks <br />patriotically of the kingdom of Cola and associates his literary <br />activity with the reign of Accutavikkanata or Accutavikkama of the <br />Kalabbha or Kalamba [kadamba] dynasty. The vinaya - vinicchaya at <br />its end describes that Buddhadatta of Uragapura wrote it. The <br />Abhidhammavatara at its end also refers to it. </p>
<p>kalabhra =  kalabbha =  kalamba =  kadamba</p>
<p>He is said to have flourished when king Accutavikkanta of the <br />Kalamba (Kadamba) dynasty was one the throne. It is difficult to <br />identify King Accuta or Accutavikkanta (Acyta Vikrama) of Kalabhra <br />or the Kadamba dynasty. But the Kalabhras once made a great <br />influence over the Chola territory and Simhavishnu, the Pallava <br />king, defeated them in late sixth century. Colian king Acytavikranta <br />or Acytavikrama who is described as 'Kalambakulnandana' <br />or 'Kalabbhakulanandana' (also Vaddhana).</p>
<p>Alvara's views :</p>
<p>Raghavacharya, who assigns date prior to that of Sankaracharya, to <br />all Alvars, mentions that according to Poygai Alvar, the Vengadam <br />hill was the habitat of elephants, which the "Kuravars" or "Kurbas" <br />who inhabited or frequented the hill used to capture and tame and <br />also scare away huge pythons. He observes that, the Tamil term <br />Kuravar used by the early Alvars is corruption of "Kuraba", who were <br />residents of this area and also of Kurnool, Mysore, Salem, Koimbtore <br />and the Nilgiris. He mentions the names of Kurubalakota, <br />Kurubalpatti, Kuruba Nagalapuram, Kurumba Palayam, Kurumbapatti, <br />Kurumbharhalli etc. in various areas. He says Kurabas or Kuravar <br />were a verile people, who were in possession of Tirumalai Hills and <br />surrounding area before Pallavas conquerred it. </p>
<p>kalabhras =  karabhras =  kurabhras = kurabas<br />kurabars &lt;=  kuravars<br />kurubas &lt;=  kuruvas</p>
<p>kalabhras were from Tondamandalam :</p>
<p>Thus it is clear that the people around Tondamandalam were Nagas, <br />though the name Naga is now a days restricted to a few groups of <br />people and not applicable to the whole race unlike in pre-Aryan <br />times, but the fact remains that those Naga tribes who are mentioned <br />above were Buddhists, as that was the original area of Kalabhras. <br />Thus we find that this area was under the influence of Buddhists <br />before the coming up of the Brahmin culture and was free from the <br />caste rivalries. It was forming the part of Asokan empire, and <br />consequently had the advantages of all the religious reforms brought <br />in by Asoka. In later times it came under the Satvahanas who were <br />also having friendly relations towards Buddhism. Nagarjuna's <br />relations with Satvahana king are well known. </p>
<p>The local people were the Pullis and Tiraiyan of Pavattiri and these <br />so called less civilized Kalavar people later migrated from the land <br />of Tondamandalam to southward areas and caused so called anarchy and <br />got designated as wicked by the Brahmin epigraphists. And these <br />Kalabars were the same as Kalabhras, and were Buddhists. The whole <br />situation boils down to one thing that during the period from <br />Satvahanas to the ascendancy of Imperial Pallavas and even in later <br />times the area of Tondamandalam was inhabited by the Buddhist people <br />and ruled by the Buddhist kings, initially under the Satvahanas and <br />later independently, and not only that but they ruled whole of South <br />India for about three centuries. And these Kalabhras were termed <br />as 'uncivilized', 'wicked' and by all sorts of abuses, and their <br />history suppressed, only evidences remaining extant in Buddhist <br />books, i.e. whatever was left of these books. The real bone of <br />contention seems to be that they cancelled the rights of the <br />Brahmins from the brahmdeya villages, i.e. the villages gifted to <br />Brahmins. </p>
<p>The Dark age or the Kalabhra Interegnum (A.D. 150 - 500) : </p>
<p>The rule of Kalabhras was termed as Dark Age. Rulers of Vengadam <br />were Kalabhras who were Buddhists. These Kalavars are the same as <br />Kalabhras. When Satvahanas put pressure on them, these anti-<br />Brahmanic Buddhist people who were ruling around Tirupati migrated <br />to whole of South India and ruled most of it for centuries, and <br />these centuries are now termed by Brahmin historians as `dark age', <br />not only because scanty information is available from Brahmanic <br />sources but also because it was anti-Brahmanic age. They were abused <br />by the Brahmins and their history was wiped out. But the Buddhist <br />books still preserve their history. </p>
<p>It is clear that the Kalvar chieftains Pullis and Tiraiyans of <br />Pavattiri are people of one and the same stock, i.e. of <br />Kalabharakula, as already seen. They were all Buddhists and they <br />migrated south wards and uprooted various kings. There was religious <br />animosity with Brahmins, villages gifted to whom were cancelled by <br />them and consequently they were abused by Brahmin epigraphists. In <br />spite of all this it seems Brahmins could not get rid of the name of <br />Tondaman who finds a place in the Puranas as founder of Tirupati. We <br />have to remember that Pullis, Tiraiyans, Tondamans represent people <br />rather than individuals, and that all these people being the same, <br />one could see how Tondaman is designated as 'Chakravarthi' when in <br />story itself he was described as no more than a small chieftain. At <br />the same time, the Kalabhras who were the same people, when they <br />uprooted various kings and convulsed the great Emperors for <br />centuries, are designated as 'wicked', 'kali-asar' etc. simply <br />because they had to depict these people in the first place as <br />devotees of Brahmanism and in the second place as enemies of <br />Brahmanism. Such is the mentality and scholarship of our elites. </p>
<p>kali =  kala =  black <br />asar =  asur =  demon<br />kali asar =  black demon</p>
<p>After the Sangam Age, Kerala passed through a dark period that <br />lasted four centuries. This era is known as the 'Kalabhra <br />Interregnum'. At the end of the 8 A.D., South Indian kingdoms such <br />as the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas and the Pandyas <br />succeeded in overthrowing the Kalabhras.</p>
<p>Kalabhra interregnum is called as 'dark period' because it is so <br />called by earliest Pallava and Medieval Pandya sources. While the <br />sangam period shows many religions entering from the North into <br />Tamilakam (Kerala+TN), no religion was that dominant and varnashrama <br />system was not at all fully entrenched. Jains did yeoman service to <br />foster Tamil grammar. 95% of the earliest Tamil inscrptions called <br />Tamil Brahmi are for the sake of Jain ascetics. These inscriptions <br />are very short, one or two lines only. </p>

Kalappirar <br />are Jains, and appear to have come from Karnataka, a Jain strong <br />hold. During the Kalabhra period, heterodoxy, opposed to Brahmanical <br />orthodoxy, reigned supreme. Pallavas and Medieval Pandyas, who <br />accepted the varnashrama and Brahmanical orthodoxy, completely <br />routed out the "heterodox" religions. Both Buddhism and Jainism were <br />practically extinguished. Hence, these "orthodox" sources portray <br />Kalabhra period as "dark period". </p>
<p>But the Kalabhra period is very important: It represents a break <br />from ancient Tamil society of Sangam period. Sangam poetry marks a <br />period where writing and literacy were introduced into Tamil. <br />Probably by Jains. Sangam poetry is great because it is the first <br />flowering of Tamil ideas and Tamil literature never could match <br />sangam period's freshness and free thoughts after contact with <br />Northern religions. Sangam poetry is the only poetry among *all* <br />Indian writings that is mostly independent of the Vedic / Sanskrit <br />tradition. Though progressively sanskritized in later stages. Hence, <br />sangam letters' importance to understand ancient India is on par <br />with the oldest sanskrit texts. Kalabhras, the flag-bearers of <br />heteredoxy, sponsored such works as TirukkuRaL, NaalaDiyAr, <br />CilappatikAram, Manimekalai, ... How could it be "dark period"? But <br />the sources from Brahmanical orthodoxy of the Bhakti era (eg., <br />PeriyapurANam in 12th century) says definitely say Kalabhras were <br />cruel. Bhakti era represents a synthesis and homogenization by <br />nonbrahmin elites and incoming brahmins. It is called as priest-<br />peasant collaboration. Saiva Vellalas are called "sad-shUdras" (good <br />shUdras). This brahmin-vellala alliance is seen clearly in Pallava-<br />Chola inscriptions. This theory was first propounded by Burton <br />Stein. He called it the "segmentary state" theory. He showed that <br />Neelakanta Sastri and other Indians concentrated so much on <br />individual kings, their dates, their ruling period, but really these <br />South Indian (and Southeast Asian to a large extent) states <br />are "segmentary" in nature. The strategy of the Kings was to place <br />the Brahmin settlements to bring homogenization to an extent <br />possible. </p>
<p>More about kalabhras : </p>
<p>Kalabhras attacked and defeated Tamil Kings who were persecuting <br />Jains. During the rule of Kalabhra kings, Jainism attained supermacy <br />in Tamil Nadu. As followers of Jainism they prohibited animal <br />sacrifices in rituals. We find that most of the invasions on the <br />Tamil country were from Karnataka. It began with the Kalabhra <br />invasions around 250 A. D., and their pillage over the Tamil country <br />for over three centuries. Then came the Chlaukya, Hoysala, and <br />Vijayanagara Nayakka invasions on the Tamil land. The Telugu <br />Pallavas ruled over theTamils after the Kalabhras.</p>
<p>While the march of the mighty oceans have destroyed the early Tamils <br />and their way of life, the Kalabhra invasion during 250 A.D. <br />decidely altered the shape of Tamil leterature and Tamil way of <br />life. Kalabharas, having been the sons of the Kannada soil did not <br />have the necessary love of Tamil to ensure its growth. Instead the <br />pronounced Jainest fanatism of these rulers have more or less <br />destroyed the acts and literature of the Tamil people to the point <br />of extinction. However various treatises on Poetics began to be <br />written along with some of the ethical works which are grouped in <br />Pathinenkil Kanakku. The most illustrious flower of the Dark Ages is <br />probably the 'Muthollayiram' 900 songs each on the Chera, Chola and <br />the Pandya Kings.</p>
<p>Kalabhras (Kalavars) captured power from the three traditional <br />crowned monarchs and ruled the whole or considerable parts of Tamil <br />Nadu for about three hundred years, roughly from 250 to 550 AD. This <br />Kalabhra interregnum paved the way to put an end to the primacy of <br />Tamil culture and language under the regimes that fofllowed - the <br />Pallavas in the northern and the Pandyas in southern parts of Tamil <br />country. Dominance of Sanskritic - Brahminical -Hindu religio-<br />cultural way of life and social organisation prevailed for more than <br />1500 years. Not only under Pallavas and later Pandyas, but also <br />under later Cholas, Vijayanar Emperors, Nayak rulers, Maratha kings, <br />and Rajas of southern principalities, the same condition continued <br />with greater sway. Even the regimes under the Nizams of Hyderabad <br />and Nawabs of Carnatic (Karai Naadu) could not get rid of the socio-<br />religious scheme of Varna Dharma and the consequent domination of <br />the Brahmins and Brahminical upper castes.</p>
<p>Under Kalabhra patronage, Tamil Jains produced literature in <br />Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit, and Tamil. The notion of an academy of <br />poets (cankam, Indo-Aryan sangha), later collectively applied to the <br />authors of the early Tamil anthologies, appears to have been modeled <br />on the Jain academy established in Madurai. Jains were among the <br />most important authors of Tamil literature between the first and <br />sixth centuries. In this period, Jains introduced didactic genres <br />into Tamil literature, producing the most important ethical texts in <br />Tamil, including several works among the eighteen shorter classics. <br />In this group is included Tiruvalluvar's Kural (or Tirukkural), the <br />best known ethical text in Tamil.</p>
<p>Kalappirar are Jains, and appear to have come from Karnataka, a Jain <br />strong hold. During the Kalabhra period, heterodoxy, opposed to <br />Brahmanical orthodoxy, reigned supreme. Pallavas and Medieval <br />Pandyas, who accepted the varnashrama and Brahmanical orthodoxy, <br />completely routed out the "heterodox" religions. Both Buddhism and <br />Jainism were practically extinguished. Hence, these "orthodox" <br />sources portray Kalabhra period as "dark period". </p>

But the sources from Brahmanical orthodoxy of <br />the Bhakti era (eg., PeriyapurANam in 12th century) says definitely <br />say Kalabhras were cruel. </p>
<p>The Pallavas became dominant in the 6th century after a successful <br />attack against the Kalabhras, which extended their territory as far <br />south as the Kaveri River.</p>
<p>Important Information about Kalabhras :</p>
<p>Identification of the Kalabhras is very difficult problem of South <br />Indian History. <br />Some identify Kalabhras with the line of Muttaraiyar of Kondubalur. <br />Some regard kalabhras as kalappalars of Vellala community. <br />Some identify kalabhras with kalvar chieftains of Tiraiyan tribe <br />from Tirupati. <br />Some regard kalabhras as Karnatas on the strength of a reference in <br />Tamil literature. <br />A Karnata king ruled over Madura. <br />Muttaraiyars of Kondubalur were the rulers between 800 A.D to 1100 <br />A.D) <br />Shri Ayangar presumes that the Kalabhras were a branch of Kalchuri <br />clan. <br />Shri K.A.N Sastri says that the Kalabhras ruled South India till <br />about the end of 600 A.D <br />Sangam Tamil Classics refer to kalabhras as semi-barbarian &amp; <br />ferocious stock of people <br />Kalabhras were referred to roam around and beyond the Venkadam <br />(Thirupathi) hills. <br />Kalabhras served as mercenaries to many of the ancient States such <br />as Mauryas. <br />Kalabhras migrated from tirupati to further South and ruled it for <br />300 years. <br />Buddhist books say that Acchutavikkanta of the Kalabharakula was a <br />great king <br />Acchutavikkanta kept in confinement three Tamil kings- Chera, Chola <br />and Pandya. <br />Achchutavikranta caused the dispersal of the Cholas <br />The Cholas disappeared from the Tamil land almost completely. <br />Acchutavikkanta ruled over Chola country. <br />Buddhadatta mentions that Achchutavikranta ruled from Kaveripatnam <br />Acchutavikkanta patronised Buddhist monasteries and &amp; authors. <br />Possibly Acchuta was himself a Buddhist. <br />Achchuta may be assigned to the 500 A.D. <br />A Kali king named Kalabhran took possession of the extensive earth <br />after 815 A.D. <br />Kalabhran had driven away numberless great kings (adiraja) <br />King Kalabhran resumed Velvikudi, a brahmadeya village. <br />Kalabhras uprooted many adhirajas. <br />Kalbhras abrogated brahmdeya rights. <br />In Pandya country brahmdeya gifts were not treated as sacrosanct by <br />the Kalabhras. <br />Kalabhras effected a political revolution, which was due to <br />religious antagonism. <br />Kalabhras sponsored great works such as TirukkuraL, Naaladiyar, <br />Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai, etc. <br />Kalabhras attacked and defeated Tamil Kings who were persecuting <br />Jains. <br />During the rule of Kalabhra kings, Jainism attained supermacy in <br />Tamil Nadu. <br />As followers of Jainism they prohibited animal sacrifices in <br />rituals. <br />Kalabhras convulsed the affairs of the Tamil country for a few <br />centuries. <br />Kalabhra period of 300 years was termed by historians as "Dark age". <br />The " Dark Age " was marked by the ascendancy of Buddhism, and also <br />Jainism. <br />The " Dark Age " was also characterized by great literary activity <br />in Tamil. <br />Kalabhras opposed to Brahmanical orthodoxy during their rule. <br />Under Kalabhra rule, heterodoxy, opposed to Brahmanical orthodoxy, <br />reigned supreme. <br />Kalabhras were the flag-bearers of heteredoxy. <br />The period : 300 A.D - 575 A.D was known as Dark Age / Kalabhra <br />interregnum. <br />Kalabhras were anti-Brahmanic Buddhist people. <br />Kalabhras were roundly denounced as evil kings (kali-asar) <br />Brahman epigraphists denounced kalabhras as kala-asar (Black Demons) <br />Kalabhra power broken by Kodungon Pandya and Simhavishnu Pallava in <br />late 600 A.D. <br />Chalukya campaigned against them in the 700 A.D and 800 A.D. <br />Mutharaiyars of kondunabalur were feudatory to the Pallavas and the <br />Pandyas. <br />Muttaraiyar ruled over Tanjore and Pudukkotai from the 800 A.D to <br />1100 A.D <br />Mutharaiyars, in the contest between pallavas and pandyas, fought on <br />opposite sides. <br />Perumbidugu - Muttaraiyan- II attended the coronation of Nandivarman <br />Pallavamlla. <br />One of the titles of the Muttaraiyar was Lord of Tanjore. <br />Vijayalaya Chola conquered Tanjore from a Muttaraiyan in the 9 A.D. <br />Kalabhras and vadugars were one and the same people : </p>
<p>We find in the Sangam Tamil Classics frequent references to a semi-<br />barbarian and ferocious stock of people who roamed around beyond the <br />Venkadam (Thirupathi) hills. They served as mercenaries to many of <br />the ancient States, particularly the Mauryas. They were called <br />Vadugar in Tamil classics. These Vadugar got split into Eastern <br />Vadugar and Western Vadugar. The Eastern Vadugar gradually became <br />Telugus. The Western Vadugar, who were called as K</p>

<p>Dear Vijay, </p>
<p>1. Prinited Volumes of South Indian inscriptions (with original <br />Tamil text, which is missing in whatisindia.com). Whatisindia is <br />giving interpretations .. know what we are, we will not accept that <br />easily without seeing the original ourselves !</p>
<p>2. Epigraphia Indica - INSCRIPTIONS with write ups by Scholars - <br />including <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastry - who wrote for Udayarkudi Ravidasan <br />inscriptions - from all over India - several volumes</acronym></p>
<p>3. Annual Ephigraphical Reports - ARE - Condensed reports : For <br />example : No: 2 collected in 1896 - Thanjai Big temple - north <br />wall - grants by all the queens of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  - about 11 of them .. related <br />to gold ornaments / silver articles.</acronym></p>
<p>Like this there are subject-wise references : I will repost on <br />Pallipadai for your kind reference.</p>
<p>4. TN State Archeology Volumes </p>
<p>5. Their Monthly Issue KALVETTU</p>
<p>6. AAVANAM - Tamilnadu tholliyal Kazhagam - Monthly issue</p>
<p>7. Thirukkoil - HR&amp; CE - deals atleast inscriptions of one temple</p>
<p>8. Varalaaru : Dr. Rasamanickanar Varalaaru issues :: Privately <br />found inscriptions are put in printed Volumes - about 14/15 have <br />been released in the past 6 / 7 years. Excellent work in private <br />Research Centre, Trichy.</p>
<p>To my knowledge these are the ones sourcing Tamil inscritpions.</p>

        <p>Lovely sir... apart from whatinindia.com, can you refer any other <br />source for chola inscriptions..</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  This is a very very important inscription NOT only because it <br />  confirms the date of Kudamuzhuku (25th yr of RRC (985 + 25 = 1010 <br />  AD) 275th day, but also this talks of the GOLD PLATEs of the <br />  Kalasa. The POSTULATE that the Vimanam was Gold plated IS <br />NEGATIVED <br />  citing this inscription.  </p>
<p>  Then so much of weight is mentioned even for the Kalasa, if the <br />  entire Vimanam is golden-roofed there should have been more <br />details.</p>
<p>  Pls search for PON VIMANAM / GOLD ROOFING and see earlier mails.</p>
<p>  But ABSENCE of such detail alone will not be useful in NEGATIVING.</p>
<p>  That was an interesting thread discussed earlier..</p>

<p>This is a very very important inscription NOT only because it <br />confirms the date of Kudamuzhuku (25th yr of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  (985 + 25 = 1010 <br />AD) 275th day, but also this talks of the GOLD PLATEs of the <br />Kalasa. The POSTULATE that the Vimanam was Gold plated IS NEGATIVED <br />citing this inscription.  </acronym></p>
<p>Then so much of weight is mentioned even for the Kalasa, if the <br />entire Vimanam is golden-roofed there should have been more details.</p>
<p>Pls search for PON VIMANAM / GOLD ROOFING and see earlier mails.</p>
<p>But ABSENCE of such detail alone will not be useful in NEGATIVING.</p>
<p>That was an interesting thread discussed earlier..</p>

        <p>Hey Vj,</p>
<p>That was amazing timeline, a real interesting one. If i may suggest,<br />you could try your hand at writing fiction, adding a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of fiction to this<br />time line would make it a pretty more interesting.</acronym></p>

<p>  Contributions to the time line are very much needed -</p>
<p>  for eg, what was AK age when he died ....we need to work back to<br />  what was his age when he fought veera pandiya at chevur...since it<br />  is mentioned that he was very young ( KN says AK though a boy,<br />  fought like a lion's whelp sporting with a tusker) ---refer also<br />  Gokul's comment<br />    Similarly sundara chola was a great warrior - but think of him...<br />  only<br />  an old man who can hardly walk comes to our mind !!   </p>
<p>  Parantaka as per the leyden grant...caused rivers of blood at the<br />  cevur battle - due to the deep cuts he inflicted on the elephants of<br />  the enemy</p>
<p>  back to time line...lets assume AK must be between 14 -18 at chevur<br />  ( at 14 would he be already worldywise - spurned of his love by<br />  nandhini....anyway its fiction. but would you take a 14 year old to<br />  battle - a la abhimanyu)</p>
<p>  if we assume he is 14 at chevur - he died when he was 24, if he was<br />  18 at chevur - he was 28 when he died. depending on that he was born<br />  in 945 or 941.</p>
<p>  based on this - leaving a gap of say a year of kundavai and probably<br />  a little more 2 years for RRC ( could be more since kundavai almost<br />  looks at him like her child) - you are looking at a 944-947 year of<br />  birth for RRC.</p>
<p>  so RRC would be between 21 - 25 on AK's assasination, between 37-40<br />  when he took over the reign.</p>
<p>  if RRC demise is fixed between 1014 - 1016 - you are looking at his<br />  death at a ripe old age of around 70.</p>

        <p>some more</p>
<p>what was <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  age when he was crowned in 1014...heard he must be <br />around 50..so places his date of birth around 1964...ie 5 years <br />before AK's assasination - would'nt tie up with <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  storyline though.</p>
<p>Also a small doubt - seen previous strings on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  wives ....a <br />painting shown him sitting with his 14 wives...but if <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  mother <br />expired before he came to throne...would make it 15 right...</acronym></acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  Contributions to the time line are very much needed - </p>
<p>  for eg, what was AK age when he died ....we need to work back to <br />  what was his age when he fought veera pandiya at chevur...since it <br />  is mentioned that he was very young ( KN says AK though a boy, <br />  fought like a lion's whelp sporting with a tusker) ---refer also <br />  Gokul's comment <br />    Similarly sundara chola was a great warrior - but think of <br />him... <br />  only<br />  an old man who can hardly walk comes to our mind !!   </p>
<p>  Parantaka as per the leyden grant...caused rivers of blood at the <br />  cevur battle - due to the deep cuts he inflicted on the elephants <br />of <br />  the enemy</p>
<p>  back to time line...lets assume AK must be between 14 -18 at <br />chevur <br />  ( at 14 would he be already worldywise - spurned of his love by <br />  nandhini....anyway its fiction. but would you take a 14 year old <br />to <br />  battle - a la abhimanyu)</p>
<p>  if we assume he is 14 at chevur - he died when he was 24, if he <br />was <br />  18 at chevur - he was 28 when he died. depending on that he was <br />born <br />  in 945 or 941.</p>
<p>  based on this - leaving a gap of say a year of kundavai and <br />probably <br />  a little more 2 years for RRC ( could be more since kundavai <br />almost <br />  looks at him like her child) - you are looking at a 944-947 year <br />of <br />  birth for RRC. </p>
<p>  so RRC would be between 21 - 25 on AK's assasination, between 37-<br />40 <br />  when he took over the reign.</p>
<p>  if RRC demise is fixed between 1014 - 1016 - you are looking at <br />his <br />  death at a ripe old age of around 70.</p>

        <p>The earliest reference of this temple occurs in the 19th regnal year<br />of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ( 1004). The stupik-kudam was handed over to the temple <br />authorities on the 275th day of the 25th year of his<br />reign ( 1010), and hence assume the consecration of the temple <br />should have taken place about that<br />time.

          some questions        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Contributions to the time line are very much needed - </p>
<p>for eg, what was AK age when he died ....we need to work back to <br />what was his age when he fought veera pandiya at chevur...since it <br />is mentioned that he was very young ( KN says AK though a boy, <br />fought like a lion's whelp sporting with a tusker) ---refer also <br />Gokul's comment </p>
<blockquote><p>  Similarly sundara chola was a great warrior - but think of him... <br />only</p></blockquote>
<p>an old man who can hardly walk comes to our mind !!   </p>
<p>Parantaka as per the leyden grant...caused rivers of blood at the <br />cevur battle - due to the deep cuts he inflicted on the elephants of <br />the enemy</p>
<p>back to time line...lets assume <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym must be between 14 -18 at chevur <br />( at 14 would he be already worldywise - spurned of his love by <br />nandhini....anyway its fiction. but would you take a 14 year old to <br />battle - a la abhimanyu)</acronym></p>
<p>if we assume he is 14 at chevur - he died when he was 24, if he was <br />18 at chevur - he was 28 when he died. depending on that he was born <br />in 945 or 941.</p>
<p>based on this - leaving a gap of say a year of kundavai and probably <br />a little more 2 years for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ( could be more since kundavai almost <br />looks at him like her child) - you are looking at a 944-947 year of <br />birth for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . </p>
<p>so <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  would be between 21 - 25 on AK's assasination, between 37-40 <br />when he took over the reign.</acronym></p>
<p>if <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  demise is fixed between 1014 - 1016 - you are looking at his <br />death at a ripe old age of around 70.</acronym></p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>attempting a time line, pl correct me if i am wrong</p>
<p>1)985 to 1014 - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  rule </p>
<p>2)1012 <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  appointed co regent</p>
<p>3)1010-1012 Big temple was completed - ( adding 25 years 275 days <br />from <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's ascending the throne)</p>
<p>4)1014. <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  ascending to the throne following demise of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym </p>
<p>5) ??? Venkat ric, when did <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  move out of Tanjore to chidambaram</p>
<p>6) 1019 or 1022 - <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  ganges campaign</p>
<p>7) ???? when did the capital shift from tanjore to <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym </p>
<p>8) ???? when was the <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  temple completed ( some info that <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  <br />completed it within his 17th year of rule - ie 1031.</acronym></p>
<p>Some corrections on your note below on the dates of the hottur <br />inscription - these were in 1007-08 and not 1016 AD ( ie - <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  was <br />possibly commander of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  forces -not even co regent):</p>
<p>Quote: </p>
<p>According to the Hottur inscriptions of Satyasraya, dated in A.D. <br />1007-08, the Chola king ??" here called Nurmadi-Chola and named <br />Rajendra ??" having collected a force numbering nine hundred thousand <br />had pillaged the whole country, had slaughtered the women, the <br />children and the Brahmans, and, taking the girls to wife, had <br />destroyed their caste</p>

<p>  1. Udayar Shri Rajendra Thevar ( RJC I ), The Thandanayagan for  <br />Northern <br />  Command Chief under Rajaraja I started his Gangetic/ <br />Northern and <br />  Northwestern imperialistic campaign from the place where <br />Gangaikonda <br />  Cholapuram stands, So in memory of his monumental victory <br />cum succesful <br />  campaign of North and North East, He errected the "City of <br />Victory" The  <br />  GangaiKonda Cholapuram. Earlier Emperor " The Rajaraja The <br />Great" had <br />  indecisive wars with Western Chalukyas which often <br />culminated in <br />  maginal victorey on either sides. However the Rajendra <br />Thever's campaign  <br />  in circa 1016 AD ended with collasal dismissal of Western <br />Chalukyas and  <br />  described as one of the Worst War crimes commited by the <br />Tamilians as <br />  derscibed by the Hutur Chalukyan Inscribtion ( Even  <br />Learned Brahmins, <br />  Women and children were massacred ).</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Is this true ?.<br />Then it is a big discovery to find the descendants of Chozha raja vamsam.<br />But I believe there is no chance for Rajaraja paramparai to exist, it<br />could be kulothunga chozha dynasty.</p>
<p>Anyway it is a big one.</p>
<p>One more funny question, what community they belong too, either<br />Thevar, Mudaliyar, Vanniyar,Udayar,...</p>
<p>Because their title is always confusing, "Udayar Rajendra Chozha<br />Thevar-ikku Yaandu...." from their epigraphy. Two communties are<br />always mentioned with their title.</p>
<p>Some light on this matter is appreciated.</p>
<p>Please do not consider this question as an offence, just out of<br />curiosity I am asking this.</p>
<p>Also, What happenned to Rajendra Chola III in 1279 A.D.?. I think if<br />we get the answer to this question we may some day find the<br />descendants of chozha dynasty.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />Balu.</p>

<p>Prabable answers for your questions</p>
<p>1. Udayar Shri Rajendra Thevar ( <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  I ), The Thandanayagan for Northern <br />Command Chief under Rajaraja I started his Gangetic/ Northern and <br />Northwestern imperialistic campaign from the place where Gangaikonda <br />Cholapuram stands, So in memory of his monumental victory cum succesful <br />campaign of North and North East, He errected the "City of Victory" The <br />GangaiKonda Cholapuram. Earlier Emperor " The Rajaraja The Great" had <br />indecisive wars with Western Chalukyas which often culminated in <br />maginal victorey on either sides. However the Rajendra Thever's campaign <br />in circa 1016 AD ended with collasal dismissal of Western Chalukyas and <br />described as one of the Worst War crimes commited by the Tamilians as <br />derscibed by the Hutur Chalukyan Inscribtion ( Even Learned Brahmins, <br />Women and children were massacred ).</acronym></p>
<p>Ref. Chola Chalukya Wars. American Institute of Oriental Research. </p>
<p>2. Pallavas were traditional followers of Vedic brahminism, which adopted some<br />of artistic skills of Buddhists/Jains from their northern boundries like Stone <br />Sculpting, Cave Temples ,Painting etc (Orissa, madya Pradesh )especially of Mauryam Empire of The Ashoka The Great, who used the hard stones such <br />as Granite, Gniss, Basalt, Earlist Hard stone Constructins and stone sculptings are found in bihar, ie. eight Ajivika Caves and Nagarjuni, sitamarhi hills. So theyintroduced it into Tamil Heart land, Earlier <br />Tamil Temples were mostly Brick works and Granite stones were generally not considered for Temple constructions.So Cholas also followed the Artistic traditions of Pallavas with slight modifications, Being a Staunch saivaites Cholas also converted the Old brick Temples into Hard Stone Granite made<br />Temples thanks to the Famous Bhakti Movement lead by Saints Thirunavukkarasar, Sundaramoorthy swamigal, Gnana sambanda moorthy swamigal, Manikka vasagar etc.,</p>
<p>3.Yes, Your assumption may be correct, After the Death of Mahendra varman I <br />Pallava -Chalukya Wars started, Peoples were more engaged in war than other activities.</p>
<p>4. This may be because of poor royal patronage extended to the development <br />of Tamil language and litrature. The tradtion and royal orders and <br />communications were in sankrit, Prakrit lastly Tamil that most learned <br />people used to write in sankrit, Prakrit. Only during periods of Nandivarma <br />Pallva malla, importance to Tamil increased. While The almost Roral communications, inscriptions and bountiful patronage was given to the Tamil litrature during the Tamil Dynasties since from the Second century AD.</p>
<p>5. The History of Kalapalars remains mistry, However, most of the historians accept that Kalapalars are either from Mysore Region or Orissa. since they were ardent followers of Jainism , They didnot allow any development of culture <br />especially womens were treated very badly in the society, The peoples of other faiths were illtreated. </p>

        <p>I saw in a TV programme, a couple of years ago, a family, mother, son<br />and daughter, introduced as descendants of the Cholas. The mother said<br />that even a generation earlier, the family used to celebrate their royal<br />status once a year wearing the royal paraphernalia and followed by a<br />feast. Now they have become poor and would like recognition and support<br />from the government. I am really sorry I am unable to provide more<br />information. I will revert if I can recall the details.</p>

<p>    2) the pallavas built the shore temple around 7th/8th C in <br />stone. <br />    why then did we have to wait for 2 more C's for Uttama/Sembian <br />    madevi to convert the brick works to stone..the two seem to have <br />    accomplished the task in a short span ( 15 years??)</p>
<p>  there is a difference. in mamalla puram there is natural rock. <br />what <br />  sembiyan madevi did was transporting rock to area far away and <br />work <br />  on it. it shows the commitment and logistics.<br />  the latter was very important.<br />  i recently read a article on nagarathar temple building from 1890-<br />1940<br />  temples like thiruvanaika and thiruvengadu were remodelled in <br />stone <br />  partly( completion of the work started 1000 years back)<br />  the donors had to transport stone across the kollidam in train and <br />  had to sign guarentees for the kolidam bridge.<br />  if the bridge collapsed the cost and damages could be recovered <br />from <br />  him.<br />  imagine it 1000 years back<br />  regards<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>    4) why do we always talk of chola/chera and pandya as south <br />indian <br />    kings - mumudi chola etc.....why pallavas are discounted</p></blockquote>
<p>Watch out for varalaaru magazine next month's issue at <br />www.varalaaru.com . the next issue is a special issue on pallava <br />king Rajasimhan. We can expect more details on kanchipuram <br />kailaasanathar temple and kadalmallai shore temples.</p>
