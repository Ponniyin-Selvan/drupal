<p>  pl dont take this into this mode - this discussion is indeed a <br />nice <br />  topic but would prefer it on a more imperonal scale - we would <br />like <br />  to hear as many views as there are - and as long as we can stick <br />to <br />  the broad guidelines of the forum ( no personal attacks)....we <br />never <br />  know who is who in the forum and since these are in public domain -</p>
<p>  its always good to have a healthy debate....its in our blood after <br />  all to debate..</p>
<p>  for eg, there are a lot of works on pallava history - i have with <br />me <br />  drawings and sketches made of mallai, kanchi, srirangam, ellora, <br />  ajanta by the british ( 18th C) which will put all of us to shame <br />  with their detailing....the idea is not to comment if they were <br />  right or wrong, as SPs sir put it is for test of time to decide, <br />  future findings or future interpretations of past findings. that <br />is <br />  the charm of dwelling into the past.... but atleast we need to <br />  compliment their efforts - their meticulous nature and their <br />record <br />  keeping. compare them to portugese. well thats another story...</p>

<p>    Hi everyone,<br />    This is a very very detailed reply to prove that stance of <br />  Mr.Ravi<br />    is not true with regards to either Kurunthokai or Gorge L Hart.</p>
<p>    1. I am posting here 4 other translations of various scholars of <br />  the<br />    same poem,</p>
<p>    About the Translator<br />    A.K.Ramanujan, He is considered one of the best translators in <br />this<br />    world. His translation are very famous world wide and most <br />scholars<br />    who took up Tamil research were inspired by his translations. His<br />    works are so very acknowledged that an Award called A.K.Ramanujan<br />    award is instituted and awarded to best translated work every <br />year.<br />    A.K. Ramanujan is popularly know for his work The Interior <br />  Landscape<br />    which is selected Translation of Kurunthokai.His verse on Red <br />earth<br />    and water is very famous and discussed already in this forum.If <br />  Tamil<br />    is known to the western world he is one of the most important <br />  factor<br />    for it.<br />    I am posting his translation of this poem</p>
<p>    Only the thief was there,no one else<br />    and if he should lie, what can I do?<br />    There was only <br />    a thin legged heron standing<br />    on legs as millet stems<br />    and looking<br />    for lampreys<br />    in the running water<br />    when he took me.<br />    (A.K.Ramanujan,The Interior Landscape)</p>
<p>    Kamil V Zvelebil, he is also another renowned scholar, google <br />his <br />  name<br />    you will know everything you need about him. I am quoting his<br />    translation below,</p>
<p>    No one was there but he, <br />    the thief.<br />    If he denies it, what shall we I do?<br />    Only a heron stood by ,<br />    its thin gold legs like millet stalks<br />    eyeing the aral fish,<br />    in the gliding water <br />    on the day<br />    he took me.<br />    (Kamil V Zvelebil,Smile of Murugan)</p>
<p>    C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature is considered <br />to <br />  be<br />    one of the great works on Tamil history. I am quoting their<br />    translation below,</p>
<p>    No one else was there, only he the thief;     should he be false,what shall I do?<br />    And when we met, there was in our sight<br />    Only the stork , with legs as thin as wisp of straw,<br />    That into gliding water peered for prey.<br />    ( C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature)</p>
<p>    This is another translation which is available, which I am <br />posting <br />  below,</p>
<p>    There were no witness <br />    when he embraced me.<br />    (If he leaves me, now what can I do?)<br />    Only the heron stood by,<br />    its thin gold legs like millet stalks,<br />    eeying the aaral fish<br />    in the flowing water.<br />    (E.Annamaalai - H.Schiffman,Mahfil)</p>
<p>    These are translation of world renowned Tamil Scholars and all of<br />    their translation are similar to Gorge L Hart and means the <br />  following:<br />    The heroine who has had sexual union with her lover is worried <br />  whether<br />    he would deny that affair and cheat her.</p>
<p>    I am also quoting the word by word meaning of Tamil verse below</p>
<p>    who- ever(was)not(there) only -he the thief<br />    he that if- denies I what shall-I-do<br />    millet-stalk-like small - green leg(s)- of<br />    running- water aral(fish) seeking<br />    heron was alone (he) took (me) day.<br />    (Kamil Zvelebil, The Smile of Murugan)   </p>
<p>    2. Kurunthokai means Collection of Short poems. It is work of 205<br />    poets complied by Puriko. Commentaries for this book is written <br />by<br />    Peraciriyar,Naccinarkuiniyar and U.V.Swaminathan Iyer. None of <br />the<br />    these commentators have ever given an Idea that Kurunthokai was <br />  love<br />    between Murugan and Valli. I wish to ask a question if Mr.Ravi is<br />    daring to question U.V.Swaminathan Iyer's interpretation and<br />    commentary on Kurunthokai.</p>
<p>    3.Kurunthokai has 27 historic allusions. If it was story of <br />Murugan<br />    and Valli, I would like to ask Mr.Ravi what those 27 historic<br />    allusions point to.</p>
<p>    4. There are references to Murugan explicitly in some poems, <br />where <br />  the<br />    hero asks heroine to do a similar act like Valli did to Murugan. <br />  This<br />    a very direct indicator that the Hero and Heroine of Kurunthokai <br />  are<br />    common people and not Murugan and Valli.</p>
<p>    Kurunthokai 1<br />    Making the field red with his killing</p>
<p>    he crushes demons.</p>
<p>    He has red shafted arrows,</p>
<p>    red -tusked elephants,</p>
<p>    whirling battle anklets.</p>
<p>    This hill belongs to Murugan</p>
<p>    and it is thick with clusters of blood- flowered kantal.</p>
<p>    Tipput Tolar</p>
<p>    (Translated by George L. Hart)</p>
<p>    The hero, wishing to make love to his women,has brought a gift <br />of <br />  red<br />    kantal flowers, whose acceptance means that she will have him.In <br />  this<br />    poem she refuses his offering(based on commentary of U V Sa).</p>
<p>    4. There are also reference that Sangam people saw Murugan as <br />God <br />  who<br />    caused love sickness, I have written an extensive blog on it , <br />  when u<br />    finish reading it every one would surely like to question <br />Mr.Ravi's<br />    interpretations.<br />    <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/</a> </p>
<p>    5. All the foreign scholars we talk about , are not any person <br />who <br />  try<br />    their hand at translation. Each of these scholars have had <br />  intensive<br />    training in Tamil under hands of great Teachers and are specially<br />    trained to read Sangam Literature. It needs special and intensive<br />    training to read and understand Sangam literature. I wonder how <br />Mr.<br />    Ravi with no formal training on this note questions scholars who <br />  have<br />    undergone training to read these literatures.</p>
<p>    6. Gorge L Hart is not any scholar, he is one of the most <br />respected<br />    persons in Tamil circles. People urged him to personally write a<br />    letter to Indian government to support Tamil as a classical <br />  Language.<br />    He is kept in High esteem among the scholars. I f person can <br />  commit so<br />    grave a mistake like Mr.Ravi says Hart has performed, I dont <br />think <br />  he<br />    would have had these kind of respect. Below is the link to the <br />  letter<br />    he wrote to Indian government in support of Tamil as a classical <br />  Language.</p>
<p>    <a href="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-" title="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-">http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-of-</a><br />  tamil-as.html</p>
<p>    These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />    I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready to<br />    produce the following:<br />    1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under <br />consideration<br />    2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />    2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it his <br />  own<br />    interpretation.<br />    3. Is there any written source which has been critically <br />examined <br />  to<br />    support his claim.<br />    4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has <br />  discussion<br />    of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.</p>
<p>    I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his <br />  reply. I<br />    simply cannot accept ' Fact becomes myth' story.</p>
<p>    Thank you.</p>

<p>      Dear Vijay</p>
<p>      I have heard of Mr.Hart before, he is a great literate and a <br />  person <br />      who has done immense study in tamil, I am not disputing his <br />  Tamil <br />      skill, his knowledge is amazing.</p>
<p>      But that does not mean that there is only one translation and <br />it <br />      means what he said. Other than the author, no one else can <br />      authenticate a poetic verse with a full message stating ' this <br />  IS the <br />      meaning'. </p>
<p>      I am convinced on the songs as I can interpret them in a way <br />  that <br />      shows undaunted love, somewhere in the lines of Radha and <br />  Krishna or <br />      Valli and Muruga ( I chose the latter as the scenario is is <br />  Kurunji). <br />      We can even translate 'Red earth' thus.</p>
<p>      Howevr, in simple words, we cannot compare Kapilar's works <br />with <br />  a <br />      mind set of PB Shelly's translations and come up with similar <br />      translations. </p>

<p>          While reading Mr.Hart's translations, i am wondering how <br />      Kapilar's <br />          genius can also be read in very simple worldly terms. <br />          Mr.Hart.... your words on our Valli and her love for our <br />  Lord, <br />      are <br />          heart breaking and misleading.</p>
<p>          I should insist that western people unless they understand <br />  the <br />          intricacies of our beliefs, will come out with such <br />  translations.</p>
<p>        Hi Ravi</p>
<p>        With due credits to mr Albert Fernando of Mintamil forum, am <br />      uploading <br />        a pdf file of his interview with Prof George Hart ( its in <br />  tamil <br />      font <br />        hence) - so that we know who we are talking of.</p>

<blockquote><p>  AND VIJAY - WHAT ARE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN " MAAMALLAI " AND SEVEN <br />  PAGODAS ?</p>
<p>  anbudan / </p>
<p>  sps</p>
<p>hi sir,</p></blockquote>
<p>swaminathans detailed work) - the seven pagodas seem more a legend - <br />there is strong proof of structures that are under the sea, but the <br />current shore temple was built specifically by the sea side...this is <br />clear because of the name given to the diety in the temple - jala <br />sayana perumal in inscriptions ( both pallava and chola)- as compared <br />to the sthala sayana perumal ( later temple) much inside mallai town.<br />Further the kasakudi Copper Plate grants of Nandhivarman talk of a <br />mandabam erected over a vishnu image. Thirumangai Azhwar's reference <br />to this image is as lord who lays on the sea shore.</p>
<p>the vishnu image ( now in really sad state) seems to be an earlier <br />structure around which two temples of shiva were erected by rajasimha <br />pallava.</p>
<p>This eastern temple is called Kshatriya-simhesvara ( four storied), <br />and the western one is Rajasimhesvara ( three storied). The Vishnu <br />shrine sandwiched is called Narapati-simha-Pallava-Vishnu-griha (the <br />name is inscribed in pallava grantam) and as per scholars is the <br />oldest sculpture in mallai . </p>
<p>These names are inscribed on the temples and are named after the <br />titles of Rajasimha. </p>
<p>The inscription of Rajaraja, the greatest Chola, found here calls the <br />complex as Jalasayanam and the Vishnu shrine as Pall-kandaruliya-<br />thevar ... so too rajendra chola's inscriptions. ( south indian <br />inscriptions volume 2)</p>

        <p>-Sen notes the intimate relationship between the temples, merchant<br />guilds,<br />Brahman communities and the Chola rulers, and how the Chola rulers<br />frequently turned<br />over conquered regions to Brahman communities for developmental<br />purposes, and that<br />these communities then involved the merchant guilds in temple<br />construction.99 This idea<br />continued that of Meera Abraham, who noted that the intimate links<br />among the Chola<br />state, merchant guilds, and religious institutions was one of<br />the "vital elements of the<br />Chola state synthesis of the eleventh century."100 </p>

<p>  Sir Walter ELLIOT, K.C.S.I., to whom Yule refers for the <br />information<br />  given<br />  about this pagoda, has since published in the _Indian Antiquary_,<br />  VII., 1878, pp. 224-227, an interesting article with the title: <br />_The<br />  Edifice formerly known as the Chinese or Jaina Pagoda at <br />Negapatam_,<br />  from which we gather the following particulars regarding its<br />  destruction:--</p>
<p>  "It went by various names, as the _Puduveli-gopuram_, the old <br />pagoda,<br />  Chinese pagoda, black pagoda, and in the map of the Trigonometrical<br />  Survey<br />  (Sheet 79) it stands as the Jeyna (Jaina) pagoda. But save in name<br />  it has<br />  nothing in common with Hindu or Muhammadan architecture, either in<br />  form or<br />  ornament."</p>
<p>  "In 1859, the Jesuit Fathers presented a petition to the Madras<br />  Government<br />  representing the tower to be in a dangerous condition, and <br />requesting<br />  permission to pull it down and appropriate the materials to their <br />own<br />  use...." In 1867 "the Fathers renewed their application for leave <br />to<br />  remove it, on the following grounds: '1st, because they considered<br />  it to<br />  be unsafe in its present condition; 2nd, because it obstructed <br />light<br />  and<br />  sea-breeze from a chapel which they had built behind it; 3rd,<br />  because they<br />  would very much like to get the land on which it stood; and 4th,<br />  because<br />  the bricks of which it was built would be very useful to them for<br />  building<br />  purposes.'</p>
<p>  "The Chief Engineer, who meanwhile had himself examined the <br />edifice,<br />  and<br />  had directed the District Engineer to prepare a small estimate for<br />  its<br />  repair, reported that the first only of the above reasons had any<br />  weight,<br />  and that it would be met if Colonel O'Connell's estimate, prepared<br />  under<br />  his own orders, received the sanction of Government. He therefore<br />  recommended that this should be given, and the tower allowed to<br />  stand....</p>
<p>  "The Chief Engineer's proposal did not meet with approval, and on<br />  the 28th<br />  August 1867, the following order was made on the Jesuits'<br />  petition: 'The<br />  Governor in Council is pleased to sanction the removal of the old<br />  tower at<br />  Negapatam by the officers of St. Joseph's College, at their own<br />  expense,<br />  and the appropriation of the available material to such school-<br />  building<br />  purposes as they appear to have in contemplation.</p>
<p>  "The Fathers were not slow in availing themselves of this<br />  permission. The<br />  venerable building was speedily levelled, and the site cleared."</p>
<p>  In making excavations connected with the college a bronze image<br />  representing a Buddhist or Jaina priest in the costume and attitude<br />  of the<br />  figures in wood and metal brought from Burma was found; it was<br />  presented<br />  to Lord Napier, in 1868; a reproduction of it is given in Sir <br />Walter<br />  Elliot's paper.</p>
<p>  In a note added by Dr. Burnell to this paper, we read: "As I <br />several<br />  times<br />  in 1866 visited the ruin referred to, I may be permitted to say <br />that<br />  it<br />  had become merely a shapeless mass of bricks. I have no doubt that<br />  it was<br />  originally a _vimana_ or shrine of some temple; there are some of<br />  precisely the same construction in parts of the Chingleput <br />district."</p>

<p>page 20</p>
<p>With the emergence of the Chola polity during the 10th-century in<br />southern India, a<br />major new player entered into Asian maritime trade. Tansen Sen<br />suggests that "some<br />credit for the `emergence of a world market' must go to the Chola<br />(or C?la) kingdom in<br />Southern India. The trading ports and mercantile guilds of the Chola<br />kingdom, he<br />suggests, played a significant role in linking the markets of China<br />to the rest of the<br />world." 97 He cites the following passage from a Cola ruler as the<br />rationale for<br />participating in and encouraging maritime trade:<br />Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants<br />and<br />good horses attach to yourself by providing them with villages and<br />decent<br />dwellings in the city, by affording them daily audience, presents<br />and allowing<br />them profits. Then those articles will never go to your enemies.98<br />Sen notes the intimate relationship between the temples, merchant<br />guilds,<br />Brahman communities and the Chola rulers, and how the Chola rulers<br />frequently turned<br />over conquered regions to Brahman communities for developmental<br />purposes, and that<br />these communities then involved the merchant guilds in temple<br />construction.99 This idea<br />continued that of Meera Abraham, who noted that the intimate links<br />among the Chola<br />state, merchant guilds, and religious institutions was one of<br />the "vital elements of the<br />C?la state synthesis of the eleventh century."100 Abraham in turn<br />drew much from earlier<br />studies by Nilakanta Sastri.101<br />The conquest of southern Karnataka by the Chola ruler R?j?ndra in<br />1032, for<br />example, appears to have been aimed at securing internal trade<br />routes in southern India<br />for the Tamil merchant guilds. At the same time, there seems little<br />doubt that the Chola<br />attacks waged on Southeast Asia port polities in 1025 and again in<br />the 1070s, as well as<br />the occupation of Sri Lanka in 1080, were all intended to expand the<br />commercial interests<br />of the polity's merchants and thereby of the polity itself.102 The<br />commercial towns of the<br />Chola polity appear to have reached a zenith between the late 12th<br />and mid-13th, possibly<br />as a result of the wealth realised through these overseas markets.<br />It also appears that the Chola-China links reached a zenith about<br />the same time.<br />records the<br />Chinese-sponsored pagoda at Nagapattinam which bore an inscription<br />in Chinese noting<br />that it was completed in the equivalent of 1267. This was balanced<br />by a Tamil temple in<br />Quan-zhou dated by inscription to 1281, suggesting quite a community<br />of Tamils in the<br />city during this period of effervescence.103<br />The trade between the ports of South China and the Chola polity is<br />also evidenced by<br />the 11-12th century Chinese ceramic remains found widely in Sri<br />Lanka and Tamil<br />Nadu.104 Classical Chinese texts also inform us that the Chinese<br />obtained all of their<br />pepper from Indian ports, and there was obviously a strong trade in<br />textiles travelling<br />both ways.105<br />Tansen Sen suggests that, "In fact, Tamil merchant guilds may have<br />been as active on<br />the Sino-Indian circuit of Indian Ocean commerce as were there Arab<br />counterparts. More<br />importantly, however, the coastal region of India and Northern Sri<br />Lanka under Chola<br />rule provided a well-organised trading mechanism through which<br />commodities could<br />flow from China, on the one end of the global market, to the Persian<br />Gulf and<br />Mediterranean ports on the other."106 While it is true that most of<br />the maritime merchants<br />travelling into China bore names which can be reconstructed as<br />Islamic, we have no<br />knowledge as to the degree to which Tamil Muslim converts continued<br />to trade along the<br />routes and possibly through the same guilds which the earlier Hindu<br />merchants had done.</p>

<p>10. Maritime Trade related Warfare<br />It has been suggested that, following the emergence of Angkor in the<br />9th century,<br />the was frequent conflict with Champa was predominantly over access<br />to China trade<br />products and control of ports (remembering that much of what is<br />today the southern<br />Vietnamese coast was at this time subject to the Khmer polity of<br />Angkor).<br />In the Straits of Malacca, attacks on Srivijaya were initiated by<br />Java in the 10th<br />century and then by the Cholas in the 11th century. The important<br />location of the polity on<br />the maritime trade routes was undoubtedly what induced these attacks.</p>

<p>By the late 11th century, envoys to Song China were paid for their<br />goods in copper<br />coin and silver bullion, and no longer in the gold, silver or copper<br />objects previously<br />provided. 35 Such payments/rewards were provided to, for example,<br />missions from<br />Champa (1072 and 1086), an Arab polity (1073), the Chola polity<br />(1077), and Srivijaya<br />(1078).</p>

          SOUTH EAST ASIAN CONFERENCE - Nov 2007 - SINGAPORE        </div>

        <p>CHINESE PAGODA AT NEGAPATAM.<br /><a href="http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Volume-222.html" title="http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Volume-222.html">http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Travels-of-Marco-Polo-Volume-222.html</a></p>
<p>Sir Walter ELLIOT, K.C.S.I., to whom Yule refers for the information<br />given<br />about this pagoda, has since published in the _Indian Antiquary_,<br />VII., 1878, pp. 224-227, an interesting article with the title: _The<br />Edifice formerly known as the Chinese or Jaina Pagoda at Negapatam_,<br />from which we gather the following particulars regarding its<br />destruction:--</p>
<p>"It went by various names, as the _Puduveli-gopuram_, the old pagoda,<br />Chinese pagoda, black pagoda, and in the map of the Trigonometrical<br />Survey<br />(Sheet 79) it stands as the Jeyna (Jaina) pagoda. But save in name<br />it has<br />nothing in common with Hindu or Muhammadan architecture, either in<br />form or<br />ornament."</p>
<p>"In 1859, the Jesuit Fathers presented a petition to the Madras<br />Government<br />representing the tower to be in a dangerous condition, and requesting<br />permission to pull it down and appropriate the materials to their own<br />use...." In 1867 "the Fathers renewed their application for leave to<br />remove it, on the following grounds: '1st, because they considered<br />it to<br />be unsafe in its present condition; 2nd, because it obstructed light<br />and<br />sea-breeze from a chapel which they had built behind it; 3rd,<br />because they<br />would very much like to get the land on which it stood; and 4th,<br />because<br />the bricks of which it was built would be very useful to them for<br />building<br />purposes.'</p>
<p>"The Chief Engineer, who meanwhile had himself examined the edifice,<br />and<br />had directed the District Engineer to prepare a small estimate for<br />its<br />repair, reported that the first only of the above reasons had any<br />weight,<br />and that it would be met if Colonel O'Connell's estimate, prepared<br />under<br />his own orders, received the sanction of Government. He therefore<br />recommended that this should be given, and the tower allowed to<br />stand....</p>
<p>"The Chief Engineer's proposal did not meet with approval, and on<br />the 28th<br />August 1867, the following order was made on the Jesuits'<br />petition: 'The<br />Governor in Council is pleased to sanction the removal of the old<br />tower at<br />Negapatam by the officers of St. Joseph's College, at their own<br />expense,<br />and the appropriation of the available material to such school-<br />building<br />purposes as they appear to have in contemplation.</p>
<p>"The Fathers were not slow in availing themselves of this<br />permission. The<br />venerable building was speedily levelled, and the site cleared."</p>
<p>In making excavations connected with the college a bronze image<br />representing a Buddhist or Jaina priest in the costume and attitude<br />of the<br />figures in wood and metal brought from Burma was found; it was<br />presented<br />to Lord Napier, in 1868; a reproduction of it is given in Sir Walter<br />Elliot's paper.</p>
<p>In a note added by Dr. Burnell to this paper, we read: "As I several<br />times<br />in 1866 visited the ruin referred to, I may be permitted to say that<br />it<br />had become merely a shapeless mass of bricks. I have no doubt that<br />it was<br />originally a _vimana_ or shrine of some temple; there are some of<br />precisely the same construction in parts of the Chingleput district."</p>

<p>“It (Negapatam) contains some remains of the former prevailing <br />system of Buddhu: In one of the streets is a well executed sculpture <br />of Buddhu, full size and seated as though in meditation.<br />Outside the town is a high tower usually called Tzina or "Silver <br />Pagoda" concerning which the traditions are many and contradictory. <br />That which attributes its erection to the Chinese, appears to favor <br />the notion of its having forme3d part of a Buddhist temple. It is <br />constructed of red bricks,<br />quite smooth and of a small size; with so little cement, that it has <br />been disputed whether any at all had been used. An intelligent <br />native who was with me when I examined the building said that a <br />cement had been used,<br />constituting entirely of the earth thrown up by the white ants in <br />forming their mounds and cells. That this earth had been ground into <br />a fine paste and used as a cement between each brick.<br />The tower is so lofty as to be the first object visible at sea and <br />was used by the Dutch for their flagstaff. </p>
<p>I have been concerned to hear a report, which I hope is untrue, that <br />preparations were making to take it down..”</p>
<p>Sadly, Hoole’s fears were proven to be true. "</p>

<p>    hi vairam &amp; ravi,</p>
<p>    pl dont take this into this mode - this discussion is indeed a <br />  nice <br />    topic but would prefer it on a more imperonal scale - we would <br />  like <br />    to hear as many views as there are - and as long as we can stick <br />  to <br />    the broad guidelines of the forum ( no personal attacks)....we <br />  never <br />    know who is who in the forum and since these are in public <br />domain -</p>
<p>    its always good to have a healthy debate....its in our blood <br />after <br />    all to debate..</p>
<p>    for eg, there are a lot of works on pallava history - i have <br />with <br />  me <br />    drawings and sketches made of mallai, kanchi, srirangam, ellora, <br />    ajanta by the british ( 18th C) which will put all of us to <br />shame <br />    with their detailing....the idea is not to comment if they were <br />    right or wrong, as SPs sir put it is for test of time to decide, <br />    future findings or future interpretations of past findings. that <br />  is <br />    the charm of dwelling into the past.... but atleast we need to <br />    compliment their efforts - their meticulous nature and their <br />  record <br />    keeping. compare them to portugese. well thats another story...</p>

<p>      Hi everyone,<br />      This is a very very detailed reply to prove that stance of <br />    Mr.Ravi<br />      is not true with regards to either Kurunthokai or Gorge L Hart.</p>
<p>      1. I am posting here 4 other translations of various scholars <br />of <br />    the<br />      same poem,</p>
<p>      About the Translator<br />      A.K.Ramanujan, He is considered one of the best translators in <br />  this<br />      world. His translation are very famous world wide and most <br />  scholars<br />      who took up Tamil research were inspired by his translations. <br />His<br />      works are so very acknowledged that an Award called <br />A.K.Ramanujan<br />      award is instituted and awarded to best translated work every <br />  year.<br />      A.K. Ramanujan is popularly know for his work The Interior <br />    Landscape<br />      which is selected Translation of Kurunthokai.His verse on Red <br />  earth<br />      and water is very famous and discussed already in this <br />forum.If <br />    Tamil<br />      is known to the western world he is one of the most important <br />    factor<br />      for it.<br />      I am posting his translation of this poem</p>
<p>      Only the thief was there,no one else<br />      and if he should lie, what can I do?<br />      There was only <br />      a thin legged heron standing<br />      on legs as millet stems<br />      and looking<br />      for lampreys<br />      in the running water<br />      when he took me.<br />      (A.K.Ramanujan,The Interior Landscape)</p>
<p>      Kamil V Zvelebil, he is also another renowned scholar, google <br />  his <br />    name<br />      you will know everything you need about him. I am quoting his<br />      translation below,</p>
<p>      No one was there but he, <br />      the thief.<br />      If he denies it, what shall we I do?<br />      Only a heron stood by ,<br />      its thin gold legs like millet stalks<br />      eyeing the aral fish,<br />      in the gliding water <br />      on the day<br />      he took me.<br />      (Kamil V Zvelebil,Smile of Murugan)</p>
<p>      C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature is considered <br />  to <br />    be<br />      one of the great works on Tamil history. I am quoting their<br />      translation below,</p>
<p>      No one else was there, only he the thief;       should he be false,what shall I do?<br />      And when we met, there was in our sight<br />      Only the stork , with legs as thin as wisp of straw,<br />      That into gliding water peered for prey.<br />      ( C and H Jesudasan, A History of Tamil literature)</p>
<p>      This is another translation which is available, which I am <br />  posting <br />    below,</p>
<p>      There were no witness <br />      when he embraced me.<br />      (If he leaves me, now what can I do?)<br />      Only the heron stood by,<br />      its thin gold legs like millet stalks,<br />      eeying the aaral fish<br />      in the flowing water.<br />      (E.Annamaalai - H.Schiffman,Mahfil)</p>
<p>      These are translation of world renowned Tamil Scholars and all <br />of<br />      their translation are similar to Gorge L Hart and means the <br />    following:<br />      The heroine who has had sexual union with her lover is worried <br />    whether<br />      he would deny that affair and cheat her.</p>
<p>      I am also quoting the word by word meaning of Tamil verse below</p>
<p>      who- ever(was)not(there) only -he the thief<br />      he that if- denies I what shall-I-do<br />      millet-stalk-like small - green leg(s)- of<br />      running- water aral(fish) seeking<br />      heron was alone (he) took (me) day.<br />      (Kamil Zvelebil, The Smile of Murugan)   </p>
<p>      2. Kurunthokai means Collection of Short poems. It is work of <br />205<br />      poets complied by Puriko. Commentaries for this book is <br />written <br />  by<br />      Peraciriyar,Naccinarkuiniyar and U.V.Swaminathan Iyer. None of <br />  the<br />      these commentators have ever given an Idea that Kurunthokai <br />was <br />    love<br />      between Murugan and Valli. I wish to ask a question if Mr.Ravi <br />is<br />      daring to question U.V.Swaminathan Iyer's interpretation and<br />      commentary on Kurunthokai.</p>
<p>      3.Kurunthokai has 27 historic allusions. If it was story of <br />  Murugan<br />      and Valli, I would like to ask Mr.Ravi what those 27 historic<br />      allusions point to.</p>
<p>      4. There are references to Murugan explicitly in some poems, <br />  where <br />    the<br />      hero asks heroine to do a similar act like Valli did to <br />Murugan. <br />    This<br />      a very direct indicator that the Hero and Heroine of <br />Kurunthokai <br />    are<br />      common people and not Murugan and Valli.</p>
<p>      Kurunthokai 1<br />      Making the field red with his killing</p>
<p>      he crushes demons.</p>
<p>      He has red shafted arrows,</p>
<p>      red -tusked elephants,</p>
<p>      whirling battle anklets.</p>
<p>      This hill belongs to Murugan</p>
<p>      and it is thick with clusters of blood- flowered kantal.</p>
<p>      Tipput Tolar</p>
<p>      (Translated by George L. Hart)</p>
<p>      The hero, wishing to make love to his women,has brought a gift <br />  of <br />    red<br />      kantal flowers, whose acceptance means that she will have <br />him.In <br />    this<br />      poem she refuses his offering(based on commentary of U V Sa).</p>
<p>      4. There are also reference that Sangam people saw Murugan as <br />  God <br />    who<br />      caused love sickness, I have written an extensive blog on it , <br />    when u<br />      finish reading it every one would surely like to question <br />  Mr.Ravi's<br />      interpretations.<br />      <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/02/lovesickness/</a> </p>
<p>      5. All the foreign scholars we talk about , are not any person <br />  who <br />    try<br />      their hand at translation. Each of these scholars have had <br />    intensive<br />      training in Tamil under hands of great Teachers and are <br />specially<br />      trained to read Sangam Literature. It needs special and <br />intensive<br />      training to read and understand Sangam literature. I wonder <br />how <br />  Mr.<br />      Ravi with no formal training on this note questions scholars <br />who <br />    have<br />      undergone training to read these literatures.</p>
<p>      6. Gorge L Hart is not any scholar, he is one of the most <br />  respected<br />      persons in Tamil circles. People urged him to personally write <br />a<br />      letter to Indian government to support Tamil as a classical <br />    Language.<br />      He is kept in High esteem among the scholars. I f person can <br />    commit so<br />      grave a mistake like Mr.Ravi says Hart has performed, I dont <br />  think <br />    he<br />      would have had these kind of respect. Below is the link to the <br />    letter<br />      he wrote to Indian government in support of Tamil as a <br />classical <br />    Language.</p>
<p>      <a href="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-" title="http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-">http://tamilvaralaru.blogspot.com/2007/12/statement-on-status-</a><br />of-<br />    tamil-as.html</p>
<p>      These are the arguments I put forward from my side.<br />      I would accept an counter argument from Mr.Ravi if he is ready <br />to<br />      produce the following:<br />      1. Word by word Tamil lexicon meanings for poem under <br />  consideration<br />      2. Whether he has read Kurunthokai completely ?<br />      2. On whose commentary his arguments were based on or was it <br />his <br />    own<br />      interpretation.<br />      3. Is there any written source which has been critically <br />  examined <br />    to<br />      support his claim.<br />      4. Does he have support of any contemporary scholar or has <br />    discussion<br />      of any kind about this topic with any of these scholars.</p>
<p>      I would sincerely request Mr. Ravi to quote references in his <br />    reply. I<br />      simply cannot accept ' Fact becomes myth' story.</p>
<p>      Thank you.</p>
<p>      Regards,<br />      Vairam</p>

<p>        Dear Vijay</p>
<p>        I have heard of Mr.Hart before, he is a great literate and a <br />    person <br />        who has done immense study in tamil, I am not disputing his <br />    Tamil <br />        skill, his knowledge is amazing.</p>
<p>        But that does not mean that there is only one translation <br />and <br />  it <br />        means what he said. Other than the author, no one else can <br />        authenticate a poetic verse with a full message stating ' <br />this <br />    IS the <br />        meaning'. </p>
<p>        I am convinced on the songs as I can interpret them in a way <br />    that <br />        shows undaunted love, somewhere in the lines of Radha and <br />    Krishna or <br />        Valli and Muruga ( I chose the latter as the scenario is is <br />    Kurunji). <br />        We can even translate 'Red earth' thus.</p>
<p>        Howevr, in simple words, we cannot compare Kapilar's works <br />  with <br />    a <br />        mind set of PB Shelly's translations and come up with <br />similar <br />        translations. </p>

<p>            While reading Mr.Hart's translations, i am wondering how <br />        Kapilar's <br />            genius can also be read in very simple worldly terms. <br />            Mr.Hart.... your words on our Valli and her love for our <br />    Lord, <br />        are <br />            heart breaking and misleading.</p>
<p>            I should insist that western people unless they <br />understand <br />    the <br />            intricacies of our beliefs, will come out with such <br />    translations.</p>
<p>          Hi Ravi</p>
<p>          With due credits to mr Albert Fernando of Mintamil forum, <br />am <br />        uploading <br />          a pdf file of his interview with Prof George Hart ( its <br />in <br />    tamil <br />        font <br />          hence) - so that we know who we are talking of.</p>
