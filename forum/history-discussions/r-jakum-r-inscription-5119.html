<p>The R?jakum?r Inscription</p>
<p>Background <br />The Rajakumar Inscriptions are inscribed on two stone pillars, <br />designated A and B by C.O. Blagden who started work on the <br />transcription and translation. <br />Pillar A, now located in the Bagan Museum, was found by Emil <br />Forchhammer, Professor of Pali at Rangoon College and Government <br />Archaeologist, in 1886-87, soon after the British annexation of <br />Upper Myanmar. It was found intact north of the Myazedi Pagoda and <br />quite close to it, in front of a small ruined temple. <br />Pillar B, now located on the platform of the Myazedi Pagoda to its <br />southeast, was in four pieces when first found. Two pieces of the <br />upper half were found in the Gubyaukgyi Temple in 1886-87 at the <br />same time as Pillar A. The 3rd piece of the upper half was found in <br />1904 in the enclosure wall of the Myazedi Pagoda into which it had <br />been immured. The 4th piece, the lower half, was found accidentally <br />buried in a small brick building east of the Myazedi. <br />Pillar A, the smaller of the two, is 1.4 m high, with each of its <br />four faces 35.6 cm wide. Pillar B, less regular, is 2.2 m high; the <br />two broader faces are 52.1 cm wide while the other two faces taper <br />down from 30.1 cm at the top to 26.7 cm at the base. <br />Since Pillar A was found intact at the Myazedi Pagoda, the <br />Inscription was named the Myazedi Inscription. But this was a <br />misnomer because the Insceiption dated back to the 11th century <br />while the Myazedi was built in the late 19th century by villagers. <br />The Inscription made reference to a cave-pagoda and this is <br />identified with the Gubyaukgyi which adjoins the Myazedi in the <br />west, and the Inscription is now referred to by its author, <br />Rajakumar, the donor of the Gubyaukgyi. <br />Texts <br />The Inscription is in four languages -- Myanmar, Mon, Pyu and Pali --<br />with each text inscribed on each of the four faces. The Myanmar, <br />Mon and Pali texts are written in a script derived from the Pallava <br />script of southern India and used by the Mons of the Dvaravati <br />kingdom in Thailand from about the 6th century. The earliest <br />representatives of the script in Myanmar are the Tr?p and Pandit <br />Inscriptions found at Thaton. In Bagan, the script was earlier used <br />by Anawrahta (Sr? Aniruddhadeva, 1044?-1077?) in the Pali <br />inscriptions on his votive tablets. <br />The Pyu text is written in another script, one derived from the <br />Kadamba script of southern India, early representatives of the <br />script being found at Sriksetra, including a 5th century gold-leaf <br />manuscript of excerpts from the Pali canon. In Bagan the script as <br />well as the Pyu language was used in an inscription on a votive <br />tablet of Sr? Ba??no attributed to the reign of Anawrahta. <br />The texts on Pillars A and B are identical although there are some <br />variations in spelling. On Pillar A, the Myanmar and Pyu texts are <br />on opposite faces; on Pillar B, the Myanmar and Pali texts are on <br />the opposite broader faces. Since the pillars differ in size, the <br />texts differ in the number of lines on each pillar: <br />Pillar <br />A Pillar B</p>
<p>Myanmar text 39 34</p>
<p>Mon text            <br />33 46</p>
<p>Pyu text            <br />26 29</p>
<p>Pali text            <br />41 40</p>
<p>The Pali text is different from the others in that it is written in <br />verse (g?th?), while the other three texts are in prose The Myanamr <br />text is the earliest known Myanmar inscription, being preceded only <br />by a short piece of Myanmar writing imbedded in Kyansittha's Myakan <br />Inscription which is in Mon. This gives the name of the tank which <br />Kyansittha dug as "Mahanirbban Lakchuykhiriy (Hand - Drawn - and - <br />Carried Water). Despite the strong claims of Mon as the original <br />text - with Kyansittha's inscriptions as well as the ink glosses of <br />the Jataka paintings of Rajakumar's Gubyaukgyi being in Mon - <br />scholars are of the opinion that the syntax in such sentences in the <br />Mon text as "in the city of Arimaddanapur King <br />Tribhuvanadityadhammaraja was king", "one queen of that king was <br />named Trilokavatamsakadevi", "that queen's son was named Rajakumar" <br />which conform to the Myanmar syntax of having the verb at the end <br />indicate that the original text was Myanmar and that it was from <br />Myanmar that translations were made. <br />Translations <br />An English translation of the Myanmar text by U Tun Nyein, <br />Government Translator, was published in 1899 and a French <br />translation of the Pali text was published by Leon de Beylie in his <br />Prome et Samara in 1907. An improved English translation of both was <br />made by Charles Duroiselle of the Burma Archaeological Survey in <br />1919 (Epigraphia Birmanica, II, i). <br />The Pyu and Mon texts were much more difficult than the Myanmar and <br />Pali texts and when they were sent to C.O. Blagden of the School of <br />Oriental Studies in London for study he expressed the difficulties <br />and his own inadequacies: <br />"The ink-impressions supplied to me were often imperfect <br />representations of much weathered and battered originals, which of <br />course I have never had an opportunity of seeing .... To do full <br />justice to these records would require in the editor a number of <br />qualifications that are seldom found united; amongst others, a <br />thorough knowledge of Mon, Sanskrit and Pali, much experience in <br />Indian epigraphy, great familiarity with Buddhist thought and <br />legend, an intimate acquaintance with local conditions of various <br />parts of Burma, much leisure and a good deal of patience. To these, <br />except the last two, I can lay no claim." <br />The Pyu language was completely unknown when Blagden made his <br />attempt and it was he who identified the unknown text of the <br />Rajakumar Inscription as Pyu. It was only the existence of parallel <br />texts which enabled Blagden to attempt a translation, and although <br />he was able to make positive identification of only some of the <br />words, with other identifications provisional, he accomplished an <br />English translation of the Pyu text in 1911 (Journal of the Royal <br />Asiatic Society, 1911). <br />For his work on the Mon text Blagden had for reference the 2nd <br />edition of J.M. Haswell's Grammatical Notes and Vocabulary of the <br />Peguan Language (1901), but the work was still difficult: <br />"The early stage of the [Mon] language was quite unknown to <br />everybody: even an intimate acquaintance with modern Mon, had I <br />possessed it, would not have made it at once intelligible. The <br />changes wrought by upward of eight hundred years are often so <br />radical that it is very difficult to recognize quite common words, <br />e.g. one may be excused for not seeing at a glance that ji?jun is <br />the same as the modern dayuin or that kandar is the old form of <br />kalaw." <br />Nevertheless, Blagden completed an English translation of the Mon <br />text in 1909, (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909) revised <br />it in 1910 (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910) and again in <br />1919 (Epigraphia Birmanica II, i). <br />Significance <br />All four texts of the Rajakumar Inscription were of significance for <br />historical and linguistic studies. <br />The immediate significance of the Inscription for historical studies <br />was the fixing of the regnal dates of the king referred to in the <br />Inscription as Sri Tribhuvan?ditya-dhammar?ja, identified with <br />Kyansittha of the chronicles. In the three major chronicles <br />Kyansittha's regnal dates appear as: </p>
<p>Pillar A Pillar B</p>
<p>U Kala's <br />Great Sak 425 Sak 450</p>
<p>Chronicle (early 18th c) (AD <br />1063/4) (AD 1088/9)</p>
<p>Mahasithu's <br />New Sak 426 Sak 455</p>
<p>Chronicle (late 19th c) (AD <br />1064) (AD 1093/4)</p>
<p>Glass Palace <br />Chronicle Sak 426 Sak 454</p>
<p>(1833)  <br />(AD 1064/5) (AD 1092/3)</p>
<p>As against these the dates of the Inscription are:</p>
<p>Rajakumar Inscription Sas 1628 Sas 1628 + 28 <br />(AD 1084/5) (AD 1112/3) </p>
<p>In a number of inscriptions by Kyansittha himself (Myakan, <br />Alanpagan, Shwesandaw, Kyaikte, Kyaiktalan), the date of his <br />accession was given as Sas 1630 (AD 1086/7) which C.O. Blagden <br />attempted to explain thus: "This may be a statement in round numbers <br />or may possibly refer to the date of his actual anointment as king". <br />Later historians have not offered any other explanation, and such <br />historians as Than Tun ("History of Burma AD 1000-1300," Bulletin of <br />the Burma Historical Commission, I, i, June 1960) merely note. "In <br />AD 1084 Thiluin Man (Kyansittha) became king but his coronation was <br />held possibly two years later." <br />The significance of the date of Kyansittha's accession was first <br />noted in 1917 ("Dates of King Kyansittha's accession and <br />coronation", Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of Burma, <br />1917) and the door was opened for a revision of the king-list and <br />regnal dates of the chronicles on the basis of the inscriptions. A <br />major step was taken by Ma Mya Than in 1932 ("Some of the Earlier <br />Kings of Pagan Dynasty", Journal of the Burma Research Society XXII, <br />ii) but not all the issues have been settled (see Tilman <br />Frasch, "The Mt. Thetso Inscription Re-examined," Myanmar Historical <br />Research Journal 2, Jun 1999). <br />In the chronicles there is no mention at all of a Rajakumar. The <br />information they provide on Kyansittha's offspring are represented <br />in the New Chronicle account: <br />o "The queens of Htilaing Min [Kyansittha] were: Apeyadana; <br />Khin Ohn, the princess of Ussa [Pegu]; Khin Tan, daughter of the <br />headman of Htilaing; and Thambula, village maiden of Kyaungbyu and <br />niece of Mahathera, whom he made queen with the name Uhsaukpan. Of <br />the four, a daughter Shwe-einthe was born to Apeyadana, there is no <br />mention in writings of a son or daughter being born to Khin Ohn and <br />Khin Tan, a son Jeyakhettara was born to Uhsaukpan".</p>
<p>Historians have identified Uhsaukpan, "Jewelled Head Ornament," of <br />the chronicles with the Trilokavatamsakadevi, "Chaplet of the Three <br />Worlds", of the Inscription and Jeyakhettara of the chronicles with <br />Rajakumar. However, the only information provided by the chronicles <br />on Jeyakhettara -- apart from the circumstances of his conception <br />and birth in Kyaungbyu and his arrival at the court with his mother -<br />- is that he was made ruler of Dha??avat? (Arakan) and the Seven <br />Districts of the Western Range. <br />A votive tablet was found at Bagan in 1931-32 in a ruined temple <br />southeast of the Nagayon Temple which bore the legend in Pali in Mon-<br />Myanmar script: <br />o eso bhagav? Trilokavatamsak?mah?dev?</p>
<p>o ya kato vimuttattham sahatthenevati</p>
<p>o This Buddha Trilokavatamsakamahadevi</p>
<p>o to be emancipated made with her hands.</p>
<p>Although the title is slightly different and although the chronicles <br />mention another Uhsaukpan -- the queen of Kyansittha's predecessor <br />Sawlu -- the votive tablet has been attributed to <br />Tritokavatamsakadevi of the Inscription. <br />Beyond initiating a study of the inscriptions to revise the <br />chronicles, the Rajakumar Inscription had a much wider significance. <br />As the earliest Myanmar text, it provided valuable material for the <br />study of the Myanmar language of the early 12th century. The Pali <br />text, too, written in verse, helped to provide an indication of the <br />mastery of Pali language at Bagan in the early 12th century. But the <br />greatest contribution of the Inscription was to the study of Pyu and <br />Mon texts. <br />Following his success with the Rajakumar Inscription, Blagden was <br />provided with some more Pyu inscriptions. Some of these (the Bebe <br />Pagoda Inscription, the Kyaukka Thein Inscription, an inscription <br />found at Bagan whose reverse face was in Chinese) were much defaced <br />and could not be deciphered. But Blagden made an English translation <br />in 1914 (Epigraphia Indica, XIII) of four short inscriptions on <br />funerary urns found near the Payagyi Pagoda at Sriksetra. The <br />inscriptions provided three names of kings of a Vikrama dynasty <br />which reigned at Sriksetra, presumably in the late 7th and early 8th <br />century, and enabled Blagden to make a conjectural identification of <br />the Pyu numerals. <br />Other brief inscriptions found at Sriksetra indicated a Varman <br />dynasty contemporaneous with the Vikrama. Thus the knowledge of the <br />Pyu language provided by the Rajakumar Inscription made it possible <br />to extract what information there was in the scanty Pyu texts. <br />Much greater advances were made in Mon where there was a greater <br />wealth of texts. Blagden followed up his translation of the Mon text <br />with translations of Kyansittha's Mon inscriptions--the Great <br />Shwezigon Inscription, Myakan Inscription, Alanpagan Inscription, <br />Shwesandaw Inscription (Epigraphia Birmanica, II, ii), and the <br />Palace Inscription (Epigraphia Birmanica, III)--with the Great <br />Shwezigon Inscription (8 faces) and the Palace Inscription (12 <br />faces) providing a wealth of detail on the ideology and ceremony of <br />the Court of Bagan in the late 11th century. <br />Blagden's translations stimulated the study of the Mon inscriptions <br />by George Coedes, Curator of the National Library of Bangkok <br />(Bulletin de I'Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient, XXV). The earliest <br />of these inscriptions were the four inscriptions on an octagonal <br />pillar found in a ruined temple in Lop Buri and placed in the <br />National Museum. Coedes sent an ink-impression to Duroiselle in <br />Yangon and a photograph to Blagden in London and, with some help <br />from them, made his translation. They were short inscriptions <br />(11,7,4,3, lines) recording various donations and were undated but <br />Coedes placed them in the 8th century on the basis of the form of <br />the letters. <br />The other inscriptions were from monasteries in Lamphun (Wat Don, <br />Wat Kukut, Wat Sen Khao Ho). The inscriptions from Wat Don (Pali 7? <br />lines, Mon 28? lines) and Wat Kukut (Pali 6? lines, Mon 30 lines) <br />provided the name Sabb?dhisiddhi - a king who was also mentioned in <br />the Pali chronicle Jinak?lam?lini written in 1516 - and three dates <br />which Coedes identified as being between AD 1213 and AD 1220. These <br />provided the basis for Coedes to attempt a re-working of the <br />chronology of the Jinak?lam?lini and in particular to establish the <br />date of accession of ?dityaraj?, Sabbadhisiddhi's ancestor, as ca <br />1150 and to date the outbreak of the epidemic at Haripu?jaya <br />(Lamphun) which led to its inhabitants fleeing to Sudhammapura <br />(Thaton) a century earlier in the middle of the 11th century. <br />TheRajakumar Inscription thus unlocked many doors and opened up many <br />avenues in historical and linguistic studies. <br />Appendix I: Translations <br />Myanmar Text (A 39 lines, B 34, lines) <br />Prosperity! Honour to the Buddha! One thousand six hundred and <br />twenty-eight years of the Buddha's religion having elapsed, Sri <br />Tribhuvanadity?dhammar?j become king in this city of Arimaddanapur. <br />A beloved wife of that king was named Trilokavatamsak?dev?, and that <br />beloved wife's son was named R?jakum?r. That king gave the beloved <br />wife three villages of slaves. That beloved wife having died, the <br />king gave her ornaments and the three villages of slaves to her son <br />named R?jakum?r. At the time that that king having reigned twenty-<br />eight years, became sick even unto death that son of the beloved <br />wife, who was named R?jakum?r, calling to mind the favours of the <br />great king who had nurtured him, made an image of the Buddha all in <br />gold. At the time he offered (it) he spoke thus: "I, your slave, <br />made this golden Buddha for my lord; the three villages of slaves <br />which my lord gave me, I gave to this golden Buddha." At that time <br />the king, being delighted, said: "Good, Good!" and, in the presence <br />of the great monk Mahather, the great monk Muggaliputtatissatther, <br />the great monk Sumedha the learned, the great monk Brahmapal, the <br />great monk Brahmadiv, the great monk Son and the great monk <br />Sanghasena the very learned, the king poured water. That being done, <br />that son of the beloved wife who was named R?jakum?r enshrined that <br />golden Buddha, and made this cave-pagoda with a golden spire. Having <br />finished (it), at the time he dedicated this cave-pagoda and Buddha, <br />he brought up (the folk of) Sakmunalon, one village, Rap?y, one <br />village, Henbuiw, one village, these three villages of slaves. That <br />son of the beloved wife, who was named R?jakum?r, poured water for <br />this cave-pagoda and Buddha, and thus said: "Let this deed of mine <br />be the cause of my obtaining Omniscience! After me, (whosoever) <br />whether (he be) my son, or grandson, or relative, or any other <br />person, if he oppresses the slaves I have offered to this Buddha, <br />may he not behold the Buddha Arimittiy?!" <br />Mon Text (A 33 lines, B 46 lines) <br />Prosperity! Honour to Buddha! Prosperity! After the religion of the <br />Lord Buddha had gone on for one thousand six hundred and twenty-<br />eight years, in this city of Arimaddanapur King Sri <br />Tribhuvanadityadhammar?j was (king); one queen of that king was <br />named Trilokavatamsakadevi; that queen's son was named R?jakum?r. <br />The king gave three villages of slaves to the queen. When the queen <br />died, the king gave all the queen's goods, together with the three <br />villages of slaves, to the queen's son, who was named R?jakum?r. <br />After the king had reigned for twenty-eight years, when the king was <br />sick well-nigh unto death, the queen's son, who was named R?jakum?r, <br />remembering the favours wherewith the king had nourished him made a <br />golden Buddha (and) went (and) offered it to the king, (and) <br />addressed (him) thus: "This golden Buddha (have) I made to assist my <br />lord. The three villages of slaves that my lord gave to me I am <br />giving to this Buddha: may my lord approve!" <br />Then the king being well pleased, expressed approval, <br />(saying), "Well done! Well done!" Then (in the presence of) our lord <br />the Mhather the lord teacher Muggaliputtarissather, the lord teacher <br />the learned Sumedha, the lord teacher Brahmapal, the lord teacher <br />Brahmadiv, the lord teacher Son, (and) the lord teacher the very <br />learned Sanghasena, in the presence of those lords the king poured <br />water onto the ground. <br />After this, the queen's son, who was named R?jakum?r, took the <br />golden Buddha (and) enshrined it (and) made this golden-spired cave-<br />pagoda. When dedicating this Buddha (and ) cave-pagoda, the queen's <br />son brought up (the men of) Sakmunalon, one village, Rap?y, one <br />village, ?ahhgir u(y) one village, all those three village-<br />communities of slaves, (and) poured out water for the golden Buddha <br />that he (had) enshrined in this cave-pagoda, (and) prayed thus: "May <br />this act of mine be a cause for the attainment (by me) of <br />Omniscience! Be it my child be it my grandchild, be it my kinsman, <br />be it (any) other person, if he do violence to the slaves whom I am <br />giving to this Buddha, may he not get sight of the exalted Buddha <br />Mettey!" <br />Pyu Text ( A 26 lines, B 29 lines) <br />? (Note: This translation is tentative, being to a great <br />extent based not so much on the obscure original as on the more <br />intelligible Burmese and Mon versions).</p>
<p>Prosperity! 1628 years after death of the Dathagada in this city <br />called Rimadhanabu Sri Tribhuvanadityadhamaraja so-called was lord, <br />his queen consort was called Trilogavadasag?devi, her son was called <br />R?jagum? (The king) gave her three villages of slaves. When the <br />queen had died, (he) gave the queen's goods (and) the three villages <br />of slaves to the queen's son R?jagum?. <br />When the king had reigned for twenty-eight years, (and) was sick <br />nigh unto death, the queen's son named R?jagum?, [being mindful of <br />the benefits wherewith the king had nourished him,] caused this <br />golden image in the likeness of the Budha to be made, (and) brought <br />this Budha into the (royal) presence (and) spake thus: - "This <br />golden Budha which I have made on my lord's behalf I present to my <br />lord. The three villages of slaves (that) my lord gave me I give to <br />this sacred image of gold." Thereupon the king was delighted (and) <br />exclaimed, "Well done! Well done!" Then (in the presence of) my lord <br />Mahather, my lord Mugalubudadisathe, my lord the learned Sumedha, my <br />lord Vrahmaba my lord Vradeyo, my lord Su, my lord the very learned <br />Sagasi, in the presence of these lords of the church the king poured <br />water (onto the ground). <br />That having been done, the queen's son named R?jagum? enshrined the <br />golden Budha, (and) having made the golden spire of the cave-pagoda, <br />pronounced the dedication of this cave-pagoda (and) having assembled <br />(the men of) Samanalo, one village, Rabai, one village, (and) (J)ivu <br />one village, these three villages of slaves, the queen's son <br />R?jagum?, having poured out water to this cave-pagoda (and) Budha, <br />spake thus: - "May this that I am doing be a cause for giving me <br />Omniscience (and) wisdom! As for these slaves, be it my son, be it <br />my grandson, be it my kinsman, be it any other person, [if he shall <br />do violence to those that I have dedicated to this Budha, may be <br />never be permitted to approach the presence of] the lord Budha <br />Arimedeya!" <br />Pali Text (A 41 lines, B 40, lines)</p>
<p>Prosperity! Having bowed to the Buddha and other (two) Excellent <br />Objects, I shall relate the noble work of merit performed, in the <br />Conqueror's dispensation, by R?jakum?ra. Hearken to me! When one <br />thousand six hundred and twenty-eight years had elapsed after the <br />Nibbana of the Lord of the World, Tibhuvanadicca, a powerful king <br />and scion of the exalted solar race, became king in the city called <br />Arimaddana. He had a beloved queen, Tilokavatamsik? (by name), who <br />was benevolent and skilful in all the affairs of the king. She had a <br />son, R?jakum?ra by name, a minister, zealous in (the management of) <br />the affairs of state, prudent and wise. The king, graciously <br />disposed towards the queen, gave her three villages for her to <br />enjoy, for life, the revenues (accruing from) the slaves (thereof). <br />Now, upon the death of the queen, the king again made those three <br />villages over to R?jakum?ra. On the king, after having ruled <br />righteously for twenty-eight years, being seized with a mortal <br />illness he (R?jakum?ra), remembering the numerous and great favours <br />of the righteous king, had a beautiful image of the Buddha made all <br />in gold and, carrying it with great pomp, and well pleased (with his <br />meritorious act), approached unto the presence of the king and told <br />him of his intentions: <br />o "On your Majesty's behalf, I have made this beautiful <br />golden image of the Master; deign, by lord, to rejoice in this <br />excellent work of merit! The three villages which you formerly gave <br />me, I have dedicated to this image; at this also rejoice!"</p>
<p>On this being said, the king, (though) his mind was troubled by <br />disease, rejoiced and, pleased and delighted, exclaimed; "Good! <br />good!" The compassionate Mahathera, the thera Muggaliputtaka, <br />Sumedha the wise, so called on account of his wisdom, Brahmapala, <br />likewise Brahmadeva the virtuous, Sona, the learned and eminent <br />scholar called Sanghasena:, in the presence of these monks (the <br />king), well pleased, poured the libation on the ground, taking the <br />earth to witness. Then, the minister enshrined the beautiful golden <br />image and built (over it) a cave-pagoda surmounted by a golden <br />spire. Having performed the dedication ceremony for the Buddha-image <br />and the cave-pagoda, he (R?jakum?ra), weary of repeated birth, made <br />the following aspiration: <br />? May this meritorious work, performed and accumulated by <br />me, be the cause of my attaining Ommicience! Whosoever, be he my <br />son, or grandson, or any other relative, with evil intent and <br />unbelieving mind should oppress those slaves, dwellers in the three <br />villages, whom I have dedicated to the cave-pagoda and the golden <br />image of the Great Sage, may this vile person be precluded from <br />beholding Metteyya, the Chief of men!"</p>
