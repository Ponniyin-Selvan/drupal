<p><a href="http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-04/frm00160.html" title="http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-04/frm00160.html">http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-04/frm00160.html</a></p>
<p>Dear friends<br />There are ruins of numerous Hindu temples I find scattered in this <br />archipelic country, especially in the island of Jawa and I am told <br />that the most ancient of them are the ones built by the Pallavas <br />during 6th / 7th Century. I suppose that of St.Arasu / Mahendra <br />Pallava period. Here is a piece authenticating what I hear often, <br />published in the Jakarta Post recently.</p>
<p>Western Java's history written on stones</p>
<p>By Ida Indawati Khouw </p>
<p>Many may be unaware that flood problems in the capital Jakarta,date <br />back to ancient times. The evidence is on ancient boulders, which <br />also show that Jakarta was part of the ancient Tarumanagara kingdom. </p>
<p>JAKARTA (JP): The capital, along with neighboring Bogor and the <br />Banten area, once formed part of Tarumanagara (1), the oldest <br />Kingdom in Java. </p>
<p>Jakarta was the site of the most important ancient monument, the <br />Tugu, one of seven stone monuments dating back to the Kingdom. </p>
<p>Tarumanagara existed between the fifth century and the seventh <br />century. The area where the substantial monument was found was <br />a village of Batu Tumbuh in present-day Tugu subdistrict in North <br />Jakarta. </p>
<p>Besides praising the revered Tarumanagara King Purnawarman, the opal-<br />shaped Tugu boulder told of the digging of a water channel, called <br />Gomati, near the place where the monument was found. </p>
<p>The stone also described another water channel, Candrabhaga (2), <br />also built during the era of the kingdom. It is believed the two <br />channels were near the present Cakung River in the Tugu area. </p>
<p>The story, which was written in the South Indian Pallava script of <br />the Sanskrit language (3), said the digging of the 11-kilometer <br />Gomati "river" which passed through the Brahman priests' lodgings <br />was completed within 21 days and the priests were rewarded with <br />1,000 cattle. </p>
<p>The boulder does not tell the purpose of the project, but experts <br />surmise it was to cope with flooding or an irrigation system for <br />crops. </p>
<p>Experts say the historical evidence makes it unsurprising that <br />modern-day Jakarta is drenched by devastating floods during the <br />annual rainy season. </p>
<p>The evidence is slim, but archeologist Hasan Djafar from the <br />University of Indonesia said the two ideas about the use of the <br />channels seemed the most reasonable. </p>
<p>"The surface of Jakarta's land is one meter to two meters lower than <br />the sea level, compared to centuries ago when some areas were equal <br />to the level. So, it's reasonable to assume that flooding also <br />occurred in the fifth century like this year." </p>
<p>He speculated that residents were also involved in farming during <br />the kingdom era. </p>
<p>"Hulls of rice used as a mixture for bricks of ancient temples were <br />found at the archeological sites of Cibuaya and Batujaya villages in <br />Bogor (West Java)," he said. </p>
<p>"It indicates that hulls of rice were abundant, meaning that paddy <br />fields existed at that time." </p>
<p>Historian Adolf Heuken questioned whether the original construction <br />was a river. </p>
<p>"It's so surprising that an 11-kilometer river could be built within <br />only 21 days, or it is just a ditch?" he said in his book Sumber- <br />sumber Asli Sejarah Jakarta (The Original Sources of Jakarta <br />History). </p>
<p>But the king's prize of 1,000 cattle indicated that the project was <br />a great achievement, he said. </p>
<p>Heuken said the project showed that people at the time had the <br />capability of digging long water channels, and were also able to <br />breed livestock. </p>
<p>Besides the Pallava scripts, a picture of a priest's trident rod was <br />also carved in the monument, functioning to separate the beginning <br />and the end of lines, Heuken said. </p>
<p>"It could be that the rod has symbolic or magical meaning," he said. </p>
<p>The stone was found in 1879 at Batu Tumbuh, which literally <br />means "emerging stone". </p>
<p>"It is said that the stone appeared suddenly after a monthlong <br />period of rain. I think the monument appeared after the soil was <br />eroded by rain," said a resident of the Tugu area, Samuel Quico. </p>
<p>Hasan said Tugu subdistrict, and thus the present Jakarta area, was <br />only part of the Kingdom, which spanned over much of present day <br />Jakarta -- ranging from Banten in the west, Karawang in the east and <br />Sukabumi in the south. </p>
<p>Experts are still searching for the kingdom's capital as no <br />archeological proof has been uncovered. Many believe it was at the <br />Tugu area but others consider the likely site in Bekasi (4), about <br />40 kilometers east of Jakarta. </p>
<p>It is also notable that the seven monuments dating back to the third <br />century only mention one king, Purnawarman (5). </p>
<p>Four other monuments at Bogor's Ciaruteun, Kebon Kopi and Jambu, and <br />Cidanghiang in the Pandeglang area about 120 kilometers southwest of <br />Jakarta, also praise Purnawarman as a great and powerful king. </p>
<p>Images on two other stones, the Muara Cianten and Pasir Awi <br />monuments of Bogor, remain indecipherable up to the present. </p>
<p>The eight-ton Ciaruteun stone was named after the river where it was <br />found in 1863. It is now well protected by the Bogor administration, <br />which built a structure to protect the stone from the elements. </p>
<p>It is not easy to reach remote Kampung Muara village -- visitors <br />must use a muddy, unpaved road, and pass along a wooden bridge with <br />some of its slats missing. </p>
<p>The four lines written in Pallava tell of two footprints carved in <br />it, and note their similarity to those of the Hindu god <br />Vishnu, "These are the footprints of His Majesty Purnawarman, the <br />brave king," the inscription reads. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, inscriptions bearing no relation to history -- such <br />as "Ina, I love you" -- have been written on the stone. </p>
<p>Located nearby is the Kebon Kopi stone with the engraving of a <br />couple of big footprints of Purnawarman, akin to those of the strong <br />Airwata elephant. </p>
<p>Footprints and more praise of Purnawarman are also at the Jambu <br />monument. The Cidanghiang stone bears only two lines of inscription <br />about Purnawarman, who is proclaimed the standard for rulers around <br />the world. </p>
<p>Hasan said the footprints found at almost of the monuments have been <br />interpreted by some as a seal, while others believed they were a <br />fertility symbol. </p>
<p>He said Purnawarman's identification with Vishnu showed that the <br />king was Hindu. </p>
<p>"Based on reports from China, written by traveler Fa Hsien, it was <br />known that the Tarumanagara people followed Hindu and Buddhist <br />teachings. But he also found some professed 'dirty' religion, <br />probably referring to prehistoric beliefs." </p>
<p>Another interesting aspect is that the scripts were written in <br />Pallava/Sanskrit, proving that Tarumanagara was exposed to <br />foreign cultures. </p>
<p>It is unclear what language was used by the local population, of <br />Mongoloid and Australoid-Melanoid extraction. </p>
<p>"The local language is probably what developed into the Sundanese <br />or Javanese languages," Hasan said. </p>
<p>Research has failed to reveal exactly when Tarumanagara came to <br />an end. </p>
<p>"At present it is believed that the kingdom finally related to the <br />expansion of the Buddhist Sriwijaya kingdom from Sumatra, as <br />dates back to year 686 and says that Sriwijaya did its utmost to <br />shown by Kota Kapur monument of Bangka island," Hasan said. "It <br />subjugate Java which did not bow to Sriwijaya." </p>

The picture and ornaments like the broken <br />  ivory means Ganesh is willing to sacrifice while the rest <br />represent <br />  wisdom and firmness. The using of the logo is widely applied in <br />any <br />  of ITB activities that makes the logo is identical to ITB's <br />  students. The institute's address itself is Ganesha Road No. 10, <br />  Bandung, West java. </p>
<p>  One of the Indonesian currency notes carries the picture of <br />Ganesh. <br />  The currency symbol ("Rp" India = "Rs") and its pronunciation <br />  ("Rupiah" - "Rupe") are actually almost similar to India's.</p>

<p>  Unfortunately the history I have read during my school days has not<br />even made passing <br />  mention of Rajendra. It has been mainly gupta and maurya periods,<br />the moghuls, <br />  shivaji and the most detailed of all south kingdoms covered was the<br />Krishnadevaraya<br />  times. So I did not know that Rajendra was a contemporary of Mohd of<br />Ghazni. Perhaps<br />  Indian history could have been different had he turned his attention<br />on Ghazni and<br />  engaged him in warfares. I know it's like saying the world history<br />would have been<br />  different had not Napolean attacked Russia or Hitler failed to learn<br />from history and made<br />  the same mistake, attacking Russia, and was beaten by its extreme<br />weather. </p></blockquote>

As<br />  per the timelines, Pallavas does not appear on the<br />  horizon till the middle of the third century AD and<br />  they start using the Tamil-Brahmi right away. Meaning,<br />  the script is already available for usage. But it<br />  would be interesting to see the kind of changes they<br />  introduced. But as per my readings, tamil-brahmi is<br />  what is referred as pallava scripts by the south<br />  eastern historians. I am open to change my view if<br />  there is evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>  2.My contention is that the merchantile contact with<br />  the south east asia is what is responsible for the<br />  introduction of the script in these areas and Pallavas<br />  has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>  3. The only known military raid(atleast to me) is by<br />  Rajendra I and by one of his successors which resulted<br />  in more contacts with SE Asia and more intermingling<br />  between the Indian settlers and the natives. This<br />  resulted in the formation of communities with mixed<br />  Hindu/Buddhist heritage and influenced heavily by<br />  Indic culture.</p>
<p>  4. There were Hindu kings who ruled in SE Asia and<br />  this is the reason for the fantastic temples still<br />  found as ruins. And the reason for a lot of hindu epic<br />  reliefs in buddhist temples like borobadur, Angor<br />  Wat(which was converted to a buddhist temple) etc.</p>
<p>  Back to John Keay, he calls the 'wars' of Rajaraja and<br />  Rajendra as raids for plunder and cites an inscription<br />  by the Chalukyas lamenting the loss of wealth due to<br />  the plunder of Chola forces. <br />============================</p></blockquote>
<p>HATTUR (near Raichur) INSCRIPTIONS : In 1006, Rajendra virtually<br />ransacked North West with an Army of 900000 (Nine Lakhs) Warriors. <br />He subdued Maykedam (Raichur). He removed Satyachreyan West Chalukya<br />and killed him. He installed his siter's husband Vimaladithan in<br />Vengi (East Chalukya) throne.. By this process, he gained access from<br />Thanjavur to Vijawada / Vizag freely. (Vizag Dhivakar / Kalinga Balu<br />will help with more details).</p>
<p>Then, post 1022 took Eastern Kalinga - and formed excellent strategy<br />with Bhoja King and completed Ganges expedition. Gazni ran away to<br />Somnathpur hearing of Rajendra's Army !</p>
<p>yes. HE WAS THE WORST TO ENEMIES !</p>
<p>regards / sps<br />=================================</p>
<p>Also cites from the</p>
<blockquote><p>  sources in Sri Lanka about Rajaraja's plunder of<br />  Anurathapura and equates it with raids by, hold your<br />  breath, Mohamed of Ghazni. <br />======================</p></blockquote>
<p>HIGH POINTS ON THIS TOPIC - DISCUSSED EARLIER ::</p>
<p>SPS wrote :</p>
<blockquote><p>  1. Like Bageerathan brought Ganges to the Earth by his penance, Chozha<br />  Twilight Rajendra brought Ganges with his Shouder power ! " says<br />  Thiruvalangadu Copper plate !</p>
<p>  2. Quote : Udayar Shree Rajendra Chozha devarUTHARAPADATHIL<br />  BOOPATHIYARAI JEYITHARULI (On Nothern Country - on the banks of Ganges -<br />  part of Bengal - conquored the Ruler) YUTHOTSAVA VIBAVATHAL (by virtue<br />  of conquering the Battle) GANGA PARIGRAHAM PANNIYARULINA GANGAI KONDA<br />  CHOZHNENNUM THIRUNAAMATHAL ( and brought Ganges and thus became known<br />  Gangai Konda Chozhan! ) ITH THIRUMUTRATHIL VAITHRULINA UTHAMAKKIRAM<br />  GANGAI KONDA CHOZHANIL.. " inscription in Ennayiram - near South West<br />  of Tindivanam! Where Rajendra constructed a siva temple for his siva<br />  Guru, Sarva Siva Pandithar !</p>
<p>  THAT settles all speculations Re Rejendra's Ganges expedition!</p></blockquote>

<p>generally taken</p>
<blockquote><p>  to be the founder of the Sena dynasty". To commemorate this celebrated<br />  victory, Rajendra assumed the title of Gangaikonda Chola, a name given<br />  not<br />  only to his new capital (Gangaikondacholapuram) but also to his<br />temple.<br />  "<br />    =================================<br />  SPS wrote earlier :<br />  I have been reading extensively on Rajendra Chozha.<br />  Summarising : He was called Rajendra Chozha devar in the 4th yr<br />  inscription of RR (989 AD). Means he should have been grown up by<br />  then.</p>
<p>  Rajendra was the c-in-c for Kanthalurchalai conquest :: 988 AD.<br />  Means he was all along in the limelight for about 25 years till RR<br />  installed him in Chozha throne in 1012, after Big temple consecration<br />  in<br />  1010 and then he had an excellent innings - in the North and Overseas.</p>
<p>  Rajendra accomplished two things which his father desired :<br />  (1) brought India mudi and Sundara haaram from Rohana hills, Lanka;   (2) Conquering Manyakedam @ Gulbargha :: RR vowed not to take part in<br />  Jalakkreedai till he conquored Manyakedam!</p>
<p>  Rajendra conquored not only Then-Madurai (Pandyas) but also Vada<br />  Madurai (Madura of Lord Krishna!) - confirms his Meykeerthi. He was a<br />  good friend of Bojarajan of Ujjain (Vikramaditha famous), along with<br />  whom he fought against Md Gazni. Fearing the might of<br />  Rajendra, Gazni left for Somnathpur and ransacked there.</p>
<p>  His ganges expedition was not a mere pilgrimage. His commanders<br />  overstayed<br />  and ruled certain parts of North! (as pointed by his name-sake!)</p>
<p>  RR consolidated Chozha holdings. But Rajendra expanded them beyond the<br />  dreams of any Tamil Kings.</p>
<p>  Marghazhi Thiruvadhirai is his birth star. Annabishekam at Gangai<br />  Konda<br />  Chozhapuram on that day - ARUDRA DARSANAM - is very famous even today.</p>
<p>  Another interesting thing : In RR's period, his Queen Olgamadevi<br />gifted<br />  a<br />  Aadalvallan (Nataraja) to Big Temple with 9 Sadais and Ganges in it.<br />  Present one in Big temple is having 10 sadais. Original piece is not<br />  there. Apart from this, there are very few Natarajas which had Ganges<br />  in the sadai till RR's period.</p>
<p>  After Rajendra's Ganges expedition only, it has become a MUST and<br />  praactice to include Ganges in the Nataraja's sadai.<br />  ======================</p></blockquote>

<p>hi<br />to the individual who is being looted or killed or having his city <br />torched the perpetarator is a demon.<br />just that rrc must have killed in hundreds and ghazni killed in <br />thousands.<br />war should be seen in the context of megalomania and economic reasons.<br />allaudin khilji and malik kafur raided the south to fund a defence <br />against the mongol hordes.<br />the mongols used to raze and burn one city and kill all citizens to <br />set an example for other cities to surrender.</p>

<p>3. The only known military raid(atleast to me) is by<br />Rajendra I and by one of his successors which resulted<br />in more contacts with SE Asia and more intermingling<br />between the Indian settlers and the natives. This<br />resulted in the formation of communities with mixed<br />Hindu/Buddhist heritage and influenced heavily by<br />Indic culture.</p>
<p>4. There were Hindu kings who ruled in SE Asia and<br />this is the reason for the fantastic temples still<br />found as ruins. And the reason for a lot of hindu epic<br />reliefs in buddhist temples like borobadur, Angor<br />Wat(which was converted to a buddhist temple) etc.</p>
<p>Back to John Keay, he calls the 'wars' of Rajaraja and<br />Rajendra as raids for plunder and cites an inscription<br />by the Chalukyas lamenting the loss of wealth due to<br />the plunder of Chola forces. Also cites from the<br />sources in Sri Lanka about Rajaraja's plunder of<br />Anurathapura and equates it with raids by, hold your<br />breath, Mohamed of Ghazni. I know, I know I am going<br />to take a lot of flak for this, but barring the<br />comparison, I tend to think that war is ugly and there<br />is always the possibility that plunder was a necessity<br />to bring other people to submission.</p>

<p>  Javanese is one of the earliest languages in Indonesia to possess <br />a <br />  literary tradition. As a result of contact with Indian merchants, <br />  speakers of Javanese adapted the Pallava script, a variant of the <br />  Brahmi script, during the 4th centruy CE to write their own <br />  language. By the 8th century CE, this Indian prototype has evolved <br />  into a distinctive script known as the Kawi script. The transition <br />  from Kawi into Javanese during the 13th century BCE was more <br />  stylistic than structural. Only the visual composition of the <br />script <br />  changed. The way the script worked remained unchanged. </p>
<p>  i have also uploading two files ( sourced from various sources on <br />  the net ofcourse) which trace the evolution of most SEA scripts <br />from <br />  pallava prototype which again evolved from brahmi</p>
<p>  would leave the rest to the learned scholars to comment upon.</p>

<p>      I am reading a fantastic book by John Keay called<br />      'India - A History'. Not just a history but an<br />      actual<br />      analysis of the artifacts and the inscriptions<br />      through<br />      which the history is derived, peppered with very<br />      interesting anecdotes of the various archeologists<br />      and<br />      linguists who have helped unravel the history of<br />      India. Currently I am reading the history of India<br />      around 300AD and I find it interesting to note that<br />      he<br />      has written extensively on the cultural influence of<br />      India in the south east Asian countries. He uses the<br />      evidences of the travellers and the actual<br />      settlements<br />      in Malay peninsula and the Mekong valley area. He<br />      uses<br />      references from Chinese resources which mention the<br />      Indian settlements in these areas during the first<br />      centuries after Christ. Infact the Funan dynasty in<br />      the Khmer region (includes Vietnam and Cambodia) is<br />      said to have been founded by a Indian Brahmin named<br />      Kaudiniya and his Khmer queen Naga Soma in the first<br />      century AD. There have been reports of the<br />      missionaries sent by Asoka who were the first<br />      bearers<br />      of Indian civilization in these areas.

Not just a history but an<br />  actual<br />  analysis of the artifacts and the inscriptions<br />  through<br />  which the history is derived, peppered with very<br />  interesting anecdotes of the various archeologists<br />  and<br />  linguists who have helped unravel the history of<br />  India. Currently I am reading the history of India<br />  around 300AD and I find it interesting to note that<br />  he<br />  has written extensively on the cultural influence of<br />  India in the south east Asian countries. He uses the<br />  evidences of the travellers and the actual<br />  settlements<br />  in Malay peninsula and the Mekong valley area. He<br />  uses<br />  references from Chinese resources which mention the<br />  Indian settlements in these areas during the first<br />  centuries after Christ. Infact the Funan dynasty in<br />  the Khmer region (includes Vietnam and Cambodia) is<br />  said to have been founded by a Indian Brahmin named<br />  Kaudiniya and his Khmer queen Naga Soma in the first<br />  century AD. There have been reports of the<br />  missionaries sent by Asoka who were the first<br />  bearers<br />  of Indian civilization in these areas. Keay also<br />  mentions of an island named Mathura in Indonesia<br />  which<br />  clearly is inspired by the Indian city names of<br />  Mathura/Madurai. There were merchant communities<br />  that<br />  operated in these areas from the Greaco-Roman times<br />  and there is proof in the form of the Roman coins<br />  found and the inscriptions found in these areas (in<br />  Pallava scripts, which are nothing but<br />  Tamil-Brahmi).<br />  What Keay argues is that Indians never ruled these<br />  areas but were mainly traders and there may have<br />  been<br />  raids by Indian kings in these areas to protect the<br />  trade interests(from Pallavas to Cholas). But these<br />  areas were Indianized to a higher level due to<br />  influence of the Hindu epics and the presence of the<br />  trading community which usually settled down and<br />  never<br />  thought of going back home. <br />  Thus I think it is very doubtful that the Pallavas<br />  built anything on Java/Sumatra and the article cited<br />  has very thin evidence as to that fact. Infact I see<br />  an article on a local Hindu king using the pallava<br />  scripts and I am not sure how that authenticates<br />  that<br />  the Pallavas built anything on these islands. If<br />  there<br />  is a inscription in Pallava script naming Mahendra<br />  varman, that is iron-clad evidence of this fact not<br />  just the usage of Pallava script(which was used from<br />  the second century AD much before pallavas).</p>
