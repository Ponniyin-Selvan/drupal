<p>Faith</p>
<p>Doubt sees the obstacles<br />Faith sees the way<br />Doubt sees the darkest night<br />Faith sees the day<br />Doubt dreads to take a step<br />Faith soars on high.<br />Doubt questions 'who believes?'<br />Faith answers, 'I.'<br />=======================================================</p>
<p>Invitation</p>
<p>A woman came out of her house and saw 3 old men with long white beards sitting in her front yard. She did not recognize them. She said "I don't think I know you, but you must be hungry. Please come in and have something to eat."</p>
<p>"Is the man of the house home?", they asked. "No", she said. "He's out." "Then we cannot come in", they replied.</p>
<p>In the evening when her husband came home, she told him what had happened. "Go tell them I am home and invite them in!" The woman went out and invited the men in. "We do not go into a House together," they replied. "Why is that?" she wanted to know.</p>
<p>One of the old men explained: "His name is Wealth," he said pointing to one of his friends, and said pointing to another one, "He is Success, and I am Love." Then he added, "Now go in and discuss with your husband which one of us you want in your home." </p>
<p>The woman went in and told her husband what was said. Her husband was overjoyed. "How nice!!", he said. "Since that is the case, let us invite Wealth. Let him come and fill our home with wealth!"</p>
<p>His wife disagreed. "My dear, why don't we invite Success?" Their daughter-in-law was listening from the other corner of the house. She jumped in with her own suggestion: "Would it not be better to invite Love? Our home will then be filled with love!"</p>
<p>"Let us heed our daughter-in-law's advice," said the husband to his wife. "Go out and invite Love to be our guest." </p>
<p>The woman went out and asked the 3 old men, "Which one of you is Love? Please come in and be our guest." </p>
<p>Love got up and started walking toward the house. The other 2 also got up and followed him. Surprised, the lady asked Wealth and Success: "I only invited Love, Why are you coming in?"</p>
<p>The old men replied together: "If you had invited Wealth or Success, the other two of us would've stayed out, but since you invited Love, Wherever He goes, we go with him. Wherever there is Love, there is also Wealth and Success!!!!!!" </p>
<p>OUR WISH FOR YOU... </p>
<p>Where there is pain, we wish you peace and mercy. <br />Where there is self-doubting, we wish you a renewed confidence in your ability to work through them. <br />Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, we wish you understanding, patience, and renewed strength. <br />Where there is fear, we wish you love, and courage. Peace to you</p>

<p>Article of this week</p>
<p>commercial activities of some of the ports along the Orissan coast .</p>
<p>The ports along the coast of Bay of Bengal had played important role in trade and commerce in coastal and oceanic trade from ancient times. This article would discuss commercial activities of some of the ports along the Orissan coast in medieval period. <br />The post-fifteenth century Orissa was not a period of urban decay as has been traditionally projected. The account of foreign travellers, factory records, Persian chronicles and indigenous literature present a different scenario. <br />Pipli, Hariharpur, Balasore and Harishpur rose into prominence. The unique character of the ports was due to commercial exchange and in this way urban centres developed due to happenings in the high seas. There was also vertical linkage with rural hinterland and horizontal linkage with different urban centres. Afterwards, the changing situation in the Indian Ocean around second half of eighteenth century resulted in decline in commercial traffic from the ports of Orissa.</p>
<p>Studying urban process and economy in their spatial and temporal diversity along with its historical context has been an unbeatable track among scholars of Indian history until recently. Its study in Orissa, whether eastern or western is virtually non-existent. The towns developed in whole of Orissa as centres of administration, pilgrimage and trade. It would be studied in a theoretical context taking into account development in the high seas, linkage with rural hinterland, commercial exchange and urban decay.</p>
<p>The towns developed in early medieval Orissa as centres of administration, pilgrimage and trade. Compared to the early period spanning from third century BCE to fifth century CE, the subsequent period witnessed proliferation of urban centres. <br />In the absence of sufficient data, it is difficult to ascertain whether the political centers were also place of trade and commerce. The use of suffix like pura, nagari and pattana with administrative centres like Dantapura, Kalinganagari, Simhapur, Suvarnapura etc proves that these were urban centres. Places of pilgrimage like Sriksetra Puri, Arkatirtha Konark and Ekamratirtha Bhubaneswar were not only religious centres but also functioned in economic milieu of the period. The temples became instrumental for the growth of market around them and pilgrims became consumers of the market. Possessing a long coastline, Orissa had number of seaports through which it established commercial and cultural intercourse with outside world. Places like Pithunda, Palura, Kalingapatnam, Manikapatna, Khalkattapatna, Konark etc became famous in international map. Some of these urban centres retained their importance in late medieval period and new towns came up. Therefore, it would<br />be travesty of truth in mentioning that there was urban decay in the so-called Muslim rule.<br />Abhinava Varanasi Kataka was the nerve centre of political and economic activities under the imperial Gangas and Gajapatis. It was a populous town in the medieval period. According to the land grant of1230 AD by Anangabhima III, the occupational group inhabiting the township covering thirty vati (375 acres) were perfumer (gandhika), dealer in conch shell (sankhika), goldsmith (suvarnkara), brazier (kamsakara), seller of betel leaf (tambulika), maker of jaggery (gudika), weaver (tanturvaya), fisherman (kaivarta) etc[i]. It was the capital of Orissa under the Mughals and was designated as Katak Banaras in the mahal-list of Ain-i-Akbari[ii]. The fort of Barabati was situated on the bifurcation of the rivers Mahanadi and Kathjori. Thomas Bowrey had described it as a city having nice buildings and broad streets[iii]. A mint was set up in Cuttack, from where gold, silver and copper coins were produced. Its silver filigree work was in great demand. The city also was famous<br />for corn, fine cloth, oil and butter[iv]. It had big bazaar for different commodities and names like Muhammadia bazaar are present.<br />The recently excavated port of Manikpatna, located on the bank of water-channel connecting Chilka lake with Bay of Bengal had yielded Neolithic celts, two sherds of Indian roulette ware, fragments of amphora, sherd with Kharoshti inscriptions and Puri-Kusana coins all pointers to Orissa&#146;s contact with outside world[v]. Deposits from period II (dated between twelfth century to early part of nineteenth century AD) consist of Chinese copper coins and Celadon ware, coins of Sahasmalla and brown glazed ware. The last item known as Maratuan ware named after a place in Myanmar was proof of trade link with that country. The Dutch in 1621 and English in 1631 attempted to establish trading settlement in Manikpatna. It was a great mart of salt in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Ganjam was another urban centre known for cotton cloth, beeswax, sugar cane and food grains. Its river was navigable from September to beginning of November. Puri, Konark, Banpur and Patnagarh<br />retained their importance as urban centres in late medieval period. Situated by the side of Calcutta-Ganjam road, places like Bhadrak, Jaleswar, Ramachandrapura, Remuna and Soro had some importance as these were halting stations for armies and travellers.<br />Sambalpur, which literally mean the town of wealth rose into prominence in medieval time after it became the capital of the Chauhan King Balaramdev in 1570 AD. Before that, the region was famous for diamonds as early as sixth century. Sambalpur, the capital of Chauhans of western Orissa was a diamond-producing centre[vi]. The presiding deity Samaleswari was installed in the centre of the fort of Sambalpur and innumerable diamond were present in her feet. A thriving diamond trade was there as evident form the accounts of T. Mootte in 1799. Sambalpur became the centre of political, commercial and military activities with the expansion of Chauhan kingdom. In the middle of seventeenth century, towns like Patnagarh, Barapali, Baudh, Sonepur, Khariar, Gangpur, Bonai etc had already developed an intricate political and trade network with Sambalpur. These towns also had themselves become urban centres. </p>
<p>On the banks of river Mahanadi, there were urban centres like Sambalpur, Baudh, Binka, Sonepur etc. Intra-regional trade was carried out bringing about remarkable changes in the social and economic life of people. The urban centres of western Orissa were connected with eastern Chhatisgarh region and eastern Orissa through the Mahanadi facilitating intra-regional trade in commodities like: cotton, ivory, precious stones, paddy, cereal, salt and medicinal herbs. The volume of river borne trade began to decline only after coming of the railways. A large number of shrines of Gods and Goddesses were constructed catering to the religious needs of the people. There was never an urban decay in western Orissa as a whole. It was beyond doubt in western Orissa, there were different types of urban centres having functional differences.</p>
<p>In seventeenth century, the political boundary of southern and eastern Orissa was subjected to changes and parts of it were controlled by neighbouring states. The area from Puri to Hijli coast was treated as part of Bengal. In the south, the Gingelly coast i.e., region between Ganjam up to river Godavari was regarded as part of Coromandel region. After coming of the Mughals, the southern ports of Orissa like Ganjam, Vizagpatnam and Bimlipatam declined to some extent. Probably the Mughal subadars and administrators showed indifference to the ports away from headquarters. Orissa was included in the suba of Bengal until 1607 and Mughal rulers with their headquarters in Bengal were interested in northern ports. Moreover, the southernmost sarkar of Kalinga dandapat and Rajahmundry did not come under effective control of the Mughals. After the conquest of Golconda by Aurangzeb in 1687, the southern part of Orissa was amalgamated with administrative unit of south. The<br />usual boundary of Orissa in different period of history along with vital part of coastal area was lost. Lack of royal patronage seemed to be another cause for decline of port-towns of southern Orissa. After the disintegration of Bahamani kingdom, the ruling elite was busy in carving out independent states. It became easier for the Portuguese to make their presence felt. The decline of southern ports of Orissa resulted in shifting of commercial activity to northern region. Trading centres were established by the European powers and consequently urban centres like Pipli, Balasore, Harishpur and Hariharpur rose into prominence.<br />As the urban centres developed due to growth of trade and commerce, the appropriate term should be port-town for these places. Situated on the mouth of Suvarnarekha river, Pipli became the earliest European settlement on the Orissan coast. The Portuguese established a trading centre in 1514, as there was free approach from sea. The British and the Dutch had established trading settlements in 1634 and 1637 respectively. Hinterland of Pipli had cotton-producing centres like Mohanpur, Olmara and Jaleswar. The Asian merchants visited it to purchase different kinds of merchandise[viii] . A centre for shipbuilding, the importance of Pipli dwindled after silting of the river Suvarnarekha.<br />Hariharpur was the first factory that English established in 1633. Situated at the mouth of river Patua, it was a populous place and three thousand weavers were present[ix]. Different varieties of cloth were produced in Hariharpur. The cotton stuff like khasa and sahan were being exported from there. The town also had trading network for sale of goods brought by he merchants. In 1642, the factory was withdrawn.<br />Harishpur, another urban centre had been described by Thomas Bowrey as the only sea-port of Orissa and Sebastien Manrique visiting the place in 1640 termed it as a city. It was famous for cotton cloth, rice and shipbuilding. Majority of the urban centres developed due to textile manufacture, which was one of principal industries of medieval Orissa. The Ain-i-Akbari had attested to this fact [x].<br />Situated on the right bank of the river Budhabalanga, Balasore is on 21?30'12" north latitude and 86?58'16" east longitude. It is located about 15 kilometres from seashore. The Persian spelling Balesar is more akin to Oriya terminology Baleswar. It rose into prominence at the time of the Mughals becoming one of the major ports of Indian Ocean. Occupying a central position, it was well connected with centres of textile production like Mohanpur, Olmara, Dantan, Jaleswar, Kasiari and Mayurbhanj. The hinterland of Balasore had abundance of rice, pulse, tobacco, tasar, beeswax, iron and timber. It had good means of transport, as it was located on the main trade route between Puri and Hugli, which ultimately led to Delhi, via Qasimbazar, Patna, Varanasi and Lucknow[xi]. . The increase of price of staple commodities due to great famine of Gujrat in 1630-32 and scarcity of piece goods in Masulipatam compelled the English to move from Coromandel up the Bay of Bengal . The<br />English endeavour to have direct commercial enterprise in Orissan coast was successful and the Mughal subadar Mutaqad Khan granted them a parwana on 9 May 1633 to build factories, repair ships and trade free of customs. Ralph Cartwright, the English merchant set up a factory at Balasore on 16 June 1633 at the invitation of officer-in-charge of the district, Mir Qasim[xii]. Apart from the trade carried out by European factors, a brisk commercial enterprise went on by the free merchants and interlopers.<br />Though the Europeans played an important role in the trade of seventeenth century, the Asian merchants had engrossed a major share. The oceanic and coastal trade went unabated. The seaborn trade from the ports of Hugli and Balasore by Asian merchants continued with Southeast Asia. The Mughal aristocracy participated actively in trade from 1640s. They invested in shipbuilding. Starting from subadar and dewan to shiqdar and faujdar, the Mughal officials became involved in trade and commerce. The shahbandar (harbour master) of Balasore, nawab Nasib Khan was owner of a ship that was engaged in trade with Maldives. There was wide distribution of merchants having diverse ethnic and linguistic origins. They were brokers of the Europeans companies and traders with their own independent capital. Khemchand and Chintaman Shah were two prominent and influential merchants of Balasore dominating the commercial scene in the second half of seventeenth century[xiii]. Suraj Shah,<br />Hira Shah, Kalyan Rai, Rajaram, Ram Narayan, Gangaram and Gopal were some of the important traders of Balasore. Some of the Rajas of Orissa were owners of ship. The Raja of Kanika had a ship going to Coromandel coast and Sri Lanka for trade. There were also Muslim merchants in Balasore, who did not belong to the ruling class. The English Factory Records mention about these traders, who sold goods to the English on contract basis[xiv] . An Armenian merchant Khwaja Jaffar had settled at in Balasore.<br />The carrying of extensive trade by merchants of Balasore must have made the town prosperous as well as populous. The business transactions carried out concerning textile industry witnessed influx of different class of people. Method of procurement of textiles was similar to other parts of India[xv]. There was advance payment system known as dadni. After receiving advance, the intermediaries on paikars gave the amount to the weavers. The broker or dalal was link between the intermediary and merchant. Sometimes, the rich investors operated through agent or gumasta. The Dutch had salaried brokers and the English were paying brokerage charge or dasturi to the dalal . There was no direct link between the weavers and European factors. The condition of weavers was far from satisfactory, as they were indebted to the intermediaries. Hamlets of weavers and artisans developed around English factory. Balasore became new habitat for this migrant class from surrounding areas. <br />They did not have any control over the sell of the product.<br />Balasore and its hinterland were centre of manufacture and production of different commodities. Orissa was producing both agricultural and non-agricultural goods in excess, so the surplus was exported to different parts of India and abroad. Balasore was linked vertically with the surrounding areas serving as a market for surplus production. There was also horizontal linkage with different urban centres, which supplied varieties of commodities to the port-town. Balasore was the emporium of cotton yarn. The variety of piece-goods manufactured in the surrounding regions were sahan (sannoe, plain cotton good of ordinary quality), khasa (cossae, muslin of high quality), nillae(cotton and silk mixed, generally of blue colour), gingham (cotton mixed with tasar silk), doriya (striped muslin), herba (tasar silk) and calico (white cloth of thick yarn). Bleaching and dyeing of fabric was also done in Balasore.<br />In seventeenth century, rice was being cultivated in Balasore district and its export to coastal India and neighbouring countries continued until the second half of nineteenth century. Alexander Hamilton had referred to production of pulses and tobacco in Balasore[xvi]. Beeswax, items made of stone, wheat, ghee and sesamum oil were other products of Balasore. It was having a flourishing liquor industry. Punch houses were prevalent in 1670s. Saltpetre, an important ingredient for manufacture of gunpowder was being imported from Patna through land-route passing Qasimbazar and Hugli. Sugar was being produced in Udaiganj, Chandrakona, Goghat (presently in West Bengal) and Ganjam. It was being brought to Balasore for export by the English and Dutch companies. The English factors reported in 1650 that price of sugar in Balasore was 7.5 to 8 rupees per bale and it increased in monsoon season to 11 to12 rupees[xvii]. <br />Shipbuilding was an important and developed industry in Balasore. Economically it was a major sector of urban employment for craftsmen, blacksmiths and artisans. The Mughal nobility had invested in this industry in 1640s. Need for naval defence and checking of Arkanese piracy compelled the Mughal government to construct a shipbuilding centre in Balasore. Availability of timber and iron from nearby Nilgiri Hill facilitated the task. The Mughal subadar of Bengal, Shaista Khan ordered naval construction in Balasore, Hugli and Jassore [xviii]. Craftsmen and blacksmiths went to Balasore from Harishpur port by the order of Sayid Muhammed, the Subadar of Orissa. Balasore had also facilities for repair work as evident from repair of English ships named Coaster and Endeavour[xix].<br />Balasore was visited by ships from Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia (Aceh), Malaysia (Kedah) and Myanmar (Pegu, Arakan and Tennasserim). The merchants of Balasore had extensive coastal trade with ports of Coromandel coast, Calcutta and Dhaka and occasionally with Malabar and Gujrat. Cowrie was being imported from Maldives and Cochin China (southern Vietnam). Bullion was a feature of import trade of Orissa by the English. The import of silver from Japan was stopped due to low exchange rate and from 1680s, the English imported it from Europe. The Dutch and English were importing lead. Import of elephants to the port-town of Balasore was a regular phenomenon. These were used in religious processions and in the army as a means of transport. Zamindars, rajas and nawabs purchased the elephants. Two ships belonging to the king of Thailand brought elephants from Tennasserim in 1679[xx]. The commodities that were being imported to Balasore were precious metals, vermilion<br />quicksilver, European guns, tin, copper, nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper and cloves. Items of export were piece goods, rice, wheat, pulses, ghee, oil, and sugar and gingelly seed. Commercial importance of Balasore town could be attested from the fact that number of ships recorded for Balasore was in preponderance[xxi].<br />In the eighteenth century documents, Balasore is not mentioned frequently unlike Qasimbazar, Calcutta, Dhaka and Patna. The muslins of Bengal received a bigger market in England than the piece goods of Balasore. A major settlement on the bank of river Hugli was necessary due to easier communication with inland factories of Bengal. The Court of Committee passed orders for transfer of headquarters on the Bay from Balasore to Hugli, which was retained as chief settlement of Bengal by Stryensham Master in 1675[xxii]. Importance of Calcutta grew up after acquirement of Zamindari right from nawab in 1698 and Balasore only looked into the requirement of ships calling there before going to Bay of Bengal. The channel to the sea was silted up and the mouth of river Budhabalanga became unsuitable for ships. Distance between seashore and town increased by five kilometres. Beginning from last decade of seventeenth century, the Mughal aristocracy began to withdraw from<br />investment in shipping. The frequent change of naib nazims of Orissa and local officials posed hindrance to trade as earlier privileges given to the English factors were interfered and new demands were put forth. The repeated Maratha invasions from 1740s onwards disrupted the hinterland of Balasore.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that wealth in urban areas was derived from rural surplus. But the unique character of towns was due to commercial exchange and in this way, urbanization was result of developments happening on the seas. In case of the port-town of Balasore and other urban centres similar thing happened. Towards the second half of eighteenth century, rise of Calcutta fleet affected fortunes of Balasore. The European companies and traders had made inroads into the preserves of Indian merchants. Hinterland of port towns became accessible to the English. Orissa responded to the changing situation of Indian Ocean and there was decline of commercial traffic from Balasore across the Bay of Bengal. Political dismemberment of the state under colonial rule and the British economic policy in Orissa sounded the final death-knell. Afterwards, the colonial towns like Cuttack, Balasore, Sambalpur, Ganjam etc responded in a different way to the changing pace. The administrative<br />measures of the colonial government resulted in change of social structure, mobility in occupation, decline in indigenous craft etc. There were major changes in economy and society of colonial Orissa in the context of colonial policy.</p>

<p>  Invitation</p>
<p>  A woman came out of her house and saw 3 old men with long white<br />beards sitting in her front yard. She did not recognize them. She said</p></blockquote>
<p>"I don't think I know you, but you must be hungry. Please come in and<br />have something to eat."</p>
<blockquote><p>  "Is the man of the house home?", they asked. "No", she said. "He's<br />out." "Then we cannot come in", they replied.</p>
<p>  In the evening when her husband came home, she told him what had<br />happened. "Go tell them I am home and invite them in!" The woman went</p></blockquote>
<p>out and invited the men in. "We do not go into a House together," they<br />replied. "Why is that?" she wanted to know.</p>
<blockquote><p>  One of the old men explained: "His name is Wealth," he said<br />pointing to one of his friends, and said pointing to another one, "He</p></blockquote>
<p>is Success, and I am Love." Then he added, "Now go in and discuss with<br />your husband which one of us you want in your home." </p>
<blockquote><p>  The woman went in and told her husband what was said. Her husband<br />was overjoyed. "How nice!!", he said. "Since that is the case, let us</p></blockquote>
<p>invite Wealth. Let him come and fill our home with wealth!"</p>
<blockquote><p>  His wife disagreed. "My dear, why don't we invite Success?" Their<br />daughter-in-law was listening from the other corner of the house. She</p></blockquote>
<p>jumped in with her own suggestion: "Would it not be better to invite<br />Love? Our home will then be filled with love!"</p>
<blockquote><p>  "Let us heed our daughter-in-law's advice," said the husband to<br />his wife. "Go out and invite Love to be our guest." </p>
<p>  The woman went out and asked the 3 old men, "Which one of you is<br />Love? Please come in and be our guest." </p>
<p>  Love got up and started walking toward the house. The other 2 also<br />got up and followed him. Surprised, the lady asked Wealth and Success:</p></blockquote>
<p>"I only invited Love, Why are you coming in?"</p>
<blockquote><p>  The old men replied together: "If you had invited Wealth or<br />Success, the other two of us would've stayed out, but since you</p></blockquote>
<p>invited Love, Wherever He goes, we go with him. Wherever there is<br />Love, there is also Wealth and Success!!!!!!" </p>
<blockquote><p>  OUR WISH FOR YOU... </p>
<p>  Where there is pain, we wish you peace and mercy. <br />  Where there is self-doubting, we wish you a renewed confidence in<br />your ability to work through them. <br />  Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, we wish you<br />understanding, patience, and renewed strength. <br />  Where there is fear, we wish you love, and courage. Peace to you</p>

<p>  commercial activities of some of the ports along the Orissan coast .</p>
<p>  The ports along the coast of Bay of Bengal had played important<br />role in trade and commerce in coastal and oceanic trade from ancient</p></blockquote>
<p>times. This article would discuss commercial activities of some of the<br />ports along the Orissan coast in medieval period. </p>
<blockquote><p>  The post-fifteenth century Orissa was not a period of urban decay<br />as has been traditionally projected. The account of foreign</p></blockquote>
<p>travellers, factory records, Persian chronicles and indigenous<br />literature present a different scenario. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Pipli, Hariharpur, Balasore and Harishpur rose into prominence.<br />The unique character of the ports was due to commercial exchange and</p></blockquote>
<p>in this way urban centres developed due to happenings in the high<br />seas. There was also vertical linkage with rural hinterland and<br />horizontal linkage with different urban centres. Afterwards, the<br />changing situation in the Indian Ocean around second half of<br />eighteenth century resulted in decline in commercial traffic from the<br />ports of Orissa.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Studying urban process and economy in their spatial<br />and temporal diversity along with its historical context has been an</p></blockquote>
<p>unbeatable track among scholars of Indian history until recently. Its<br />study in Orissa, whether eastern or western is virtually non-existent.<br />The towns developed in whole of Orissa as centres of administration,<br />pilgrimage and trade. It would be studied in a theoretical context<br />taking into account development in the high seas, linkage with rural<br />hinterland, commercial exchange and urban decay.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The towns developed in early medieval Orissa as centres of<br />administration, pilgrimage and trade. Compared to the early period</p></blockquote>
<p>spanning from third century BCE to fifth century CE, the subsequent<br />period witnessed proliferation of urban centres. </p>
<blockquote><p>  In the absence of sufficient data, it is difficult to ascertain<br />whether the political centers were also place of trade and commerce. </p></blockquote>
<p>The use of suffix like pura, nagari and pattana with administrative<br />centres like Dantapura, Kalinganagari, Simhapur, Suvarnapura etc<br />proves that these were urban centres. Places of pilgrimage like<br />Sriksetra Puri, Arkatirtha Konark and Ekamratirtha Bhubaneswar were<br />not only religious centres but also functioned in economic milieu of<br />the period. The temples became instrumental for the growth of market<br />around them and pilgrims became consumers of the market. Possessing a<br />long coastline, Orissa had number of seaports through which it<br />established commercial and cultural intercourse with outside world. <br />Places like Pithunda, Palura, Kalingapatnam, Manikapatna,<br />Khalkattapatna, Konark etc became famous in international map. Some<br />of these urban centres retained their importance in late medieval<br />period and new towns came up. Therefore, it would</p>
<blockquote><p>  be travesty of truth in mentioning that there was urban decay in<br />the so-called Muslim rule.<br />  Abhinava Varanasi Kataka was the nerve centre of political and<br />economic activities under the imperial Gangas and Gajapatis. It was a</p></blockquote>
<p>populous town in the medieval period. According to the land grant<br />of1230 AD by Anangabhima III, the occupational group inhabiting the<br />township covering thirty vati (375 acres) were perfumer (gandhika),<br />dealer in conch shell (sankhika), goldsmith (suvarnkara), brazier<br />(kamsakara), seller of betel leaf (tambulika), maker of jaggery<br />(gudika), weaver (tanturvaya), fisherman (kaivarta) etc[i]. It was<br />the capital of Orissa under the Mughals and was designated as Katak<br />Banaras in the mahal-list of Ain-i-Akbari[ii]. The fort of Barabati<br />was situated on the bifurcation of the rivers Mahanadi and Kathjori.<br />Thomas Bowrey had described it as a city having nice buildings and<br />broad streets[iii]. A mint was set up in Cuttack, from where gold,<br />silver and copper coins were produced. Its silver filigree work was in<br />great demand. The city also was famous</p>
<blockquote><p>  for corn, fine cloth, oil and butter[iv]. It had big bazaar for<br />different commodities and names like Muhammadia bazaar are present.<br />  The recently excavated port of Manikpatna, located on the bank of<br />water-channel connecting Chilka lake with Bay of Bengal had yielded</p></blockquote>
<p>Neolithic celts, two sherds of Indian roulette ware, fragments of<br />amphora, sherd with Kharoshti inscriptions and Puri-Kusana coins all<br />pointers to Orissa's contact with outside world[v]. Deposits from<br />period II (dated between twelfth century to early part of nineteenth<br />century AD) consist of Chinese copper coins and Celadon ware, coins of<br />Sahasmalla and brown glazed ware. The last item known as Maratuan<br />ware named after a place in Myanmar was proof of trade link with that<br />country. The Dutch in 1621 and English in 1631 attempted to establish<br />trading settlement in Manikpatna. It was a great mart of salt in<br />sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Ganjam was another urban centre<br />known for cotton cloth, beeswax, sugar cane and food grains. Its<br />river was navigable from September to beginning of November. Puri,<br />Konark, Banpur and Patnagarh</p>
<blockquote><p>  retained their importance as urban centres in late medieval period.<br />Situated by the side of Calcutta-Ganjam road, places like Bhadrak,</p></blockquote>
<p>Jaleswar, Ramachandrapura, Remuna and Soro had some importance as<br />these were halting stations for armies and travellers.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Sambalpur, which literally mean the town of wealth rose into<br />prominence in medieval time after it became the capital of the Chauhan</p></blockquote>
<p>King Balaramdev in 1570 AD. Before that, the region was famous for<br />diamonds as early as sixth century. Sambalpur, the capital of Chauhans<br />of western Orissa was a diamond-producing centre[vi]. The presiding<br />deity Samaleswari was installed in the centre of the fort of Sambalpur<br />and innumerable diamond were present in her feet. A thriving diamond<br />trade was there as evident form the accounts of T. Mootte in 1799.<br />Sambalpur became the centre of political, commercial and military<br />activities with the expansion of Chauhan kingdom. In the middle of<br />seventeenth century, towns like Patnagarh, Barapali, Baudh, Sonepur,<br />Khariar, Gangpur, Bonai etc had already developed an intricate<br />political and trade network with Sambalpur. These towns also had<br />themselves become urban centres. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Suvarnapur (modern Sonepur) was not only an important capital city<br />in medieval western Orissa, but also was an important centre for</p></blockquote>
<p>well as urban centres like Baudh and Patna, different commodities were<br />brought to Suvarnapur for export. It was also famous for manufacturing<br />tusser cloth of excellent quality[vii]. The weaving was done by a<br />professional class know as Bhuliya in local parlance. Brass and bell<br />metals utensils were manufactured in this important urban centre.<br />Temples and places of pilgrimage proliferated in medieval period and<br />small township grew around temples of Ranipur-Jharial and Harishankar,<br />Narashinghnath etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>  On the banks of river Mahanadi, there were urban centres like<br />Sambalpur, Baudh, Binka, Sonepur etc. Intra-regional trade was carried</p></blockquote>
<p>out bringing about remarkable changes in the social and economic life<br />of people. The urban centres of western Orissa were connected with<br />eastern Chhatisgarh region and eastern Orissa through the Mahanadi<br />facilitating intra-regional trade in commodities like: cotton, ivory,<br />precious stones, paddy, cereal, salt and medicinal herbs. The volume<br />of river borne trade began to decline only after coming of the<br />railways. A large number of shrines of Gods and Goddesses were<br />constructed catering to the religious needs of the people. There was<br />never an urban decay in western Orissa as a whole. It was beyond doubt<br />in western Orissa, there were different types of urban centres having<br />functional differences.</p>
<blockquote><p>  In seventeenth century, the political boundary of southern and<br />eastern Orissa was subjected to changes and parts of it were</p></blockquote>
<p>controlled by neighbouring states. The area from Puri to Hijli coast<br />was treated as part of Bengal. In the south, the Gingelly coast i.e.,<br />region between Ganjam up to river Godavari was regarded as part of<br />Coromandel region. After coming of the Mughals, the southern ports of<br />Orissa like Ganjam, Vizagpatnam and Bimlipatam declined to some<br />extent. Probably the Mughal subadars and administrators showed<br />indifference to the ports away from headquarters. Orissa was included<br />in the suba of Bengal until 1607 and Mughal rulers with their<br />headquarters in Bengal were interested in northern ports. Moreover,<br />the southernmost sarkar of Kalinga dandapat and Rajahmundry did not<br />come under effective control of the Mughals. After the conquest of<br />Golconda by Aurangzeb in 1687, the southern part of Orissa was<br />amalgamated with administrative unit of south. The</p>
<blockquote><p>  usual boundary of Orissa in different period of history along with<br />vital part of coastal area was lost. Lack of royal patronage seemed</p></blockquote>
<p>to be another cause for decline of port-towns of southern Orissa. <br />After the disintegration of Bahamani kingdom, the ruling elite was<br />busy in carving out independent states. It became easier for the<br />Portuguese to make their presence felt. The decline of southern ports<br />of Orissa resulted in shifting of commercial activity to northern<br />region. Trading centres were established by the European powers and<br />consequently urban centres like Pipli, Balasore, Harishpur and<br />Hariharpur rose into prominence.</p>
<blockquote><p>  As the urban centres developed due to growth of trade and<br />commerce, the appropriate term should be port-town for these places. </p></blockquote>
<p>Situated on the mouth of Suvarnarekha river, Pipli became the earliest<br />European settlement on the Orissan coast. The Portuguese established<br />a trading centre in 1514, as there was free approach from sea. The<br />British and the Dutch had established trading settlements in 1634 and<br />1637 respectively. Hinterland of Pipli had cotton-producing centres<br />like Mohanpur, Olmara and Jaleswar. The Asian merchants visited it<br />to purchase different kinds of merchandise[viii] . A centre for<br />shipbuilding, the importance of Pipli dwindled after silting of the<br />river Suvarnarekha.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hariharpur was the first factory that English established in 1633.<br />Situated at the mouth of river Patua, it was a populous place and</p></blockquote>
<p>three thousand weavers were present[ix]. Different varieties of cloth<br />were produced in Hariharpur. The cotton stuff like khasa and sahan<br />were being exported from there. The town also had trading network for<br />sale of goods brought by he merchants. In 1642, the factory was withdrawn.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Harishpur, another urban centre had been described by Thomas<br />Bowrey as the only sea-port of Orissa and Sebastien Manrique visiting</p></blockquote>
<p>the place in 1640 termed it as a city. It was famous for cotton<br />cloth, rice and shipbuilding. Majority of the urban centres developed<br />due to textile manufacture, which was one of principal industries of<br />medieval Orissa. The Ain-i-Akbari had attested to this fact [x].</p>
<blockquote><p>  Situated on the right bank of the river Budhabalanga, Balasore is<br />on 21?30'12" north latitude and 86?58'16" east longitude. It is</p></blockquote>
<p>located about 15 kilometres from seashore. The Persian spelling<br />Balesar is more akin to Oriya terminology Baleswar. It rose into<br />prominence at the time of the Mughals becoming one of the major ports<br />of Indian Ocean. Occupying a central position, it was well connected<br />with centres of textile production like Mohanpur, Olmara, Dantan,<br />Jaleswar, Kasiari and Mayurbhanj. The hinterland of Balasore had<br />abundance of rice, pulse, tobacco, tasar, beeswax, iron and timber. <br />It had good means of transport, as it was located on the main trade<br />route between Puri and Hugli, which ultimately led to Delhi, via<br />Qasimbazar, Patna, Varanasi and Lucknow[xi]. . The increase of price<br />of staple commodities due to great famine of Gujrat in 1630-32 and<br />scarcity of piece goods in Masulipatam compelled the English to move<br />from Coromandel up the Bay of Bengal . The</p>
<blockquote><p>  English endeavour to have direct commercial enterprise in Orissan<br />coast was successful and the Mughal subadar Mutaqad Khan granted them</p></blockquote>
<p>a parwana on 9 May 1633 to build factories, repair ships and trade<br />free of customs. Ralph Cartwright, the English merchant set up a<br />factory at Balasore on 16 June 1633 at the invitation of<br />officer-in-charge of the district, Mir Qasim[xii]. Apart from the<br />trade carried out by European factors, a brisk commercial enterprise<br />went on by the free merchants and interlopers.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Though the Europeans played an important role in the trade of<br />seventeenth century, the Asian merchants had engrossed a major share.</p></blockquote>
<p>The oceanic and coastal trade went unabated. The seaborn trade from<br />the ports of Hugli and Balasore by Asian merchants continued with<br />Southeast Asia. The Mughal aristocracy participated actively in trade<br />from 1640s. They invested in shipbuilding. Starting from subadar and<br />dewan to shiqdar and faujdar, the Mughal officials became involved in<br />trade and commerce. The shahbandar (harbour master) of Balasore,<br />nawab Nasib Khan was owner of a ship that was engaged in trade with<br />Maldives. There was wide distribution of merchants having diverse<br />ethnic and linguistic origins. They were brokers of the Europeans<br />companies and traders with their own independent capital. Khemchand<br />and Chintaman Shah were two prominent and influential merchants of<br />Balasore dominating the commercial scene in the second half of<br />seventeenth century[xiii]. Suraj Shah,</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hira Shah, Kalyan Rai, Rajaram, Ram Narayan, Gangaram and Gopal<br />were some of the important traders of Balasore. Some of the Rajas of</p></blockquote>
<p>Orissa were owners of ship. The Raja of Kanika had a ship going to<br />Coromandel coast and Sri Lanka for trade. There were also Muslim<br />merchants in Balasore, who did not belong to the ruling class. The<br />English Factory Records mention about these traders, who sold goods to<br />the English on contract basis[xiv] . An Armenian merchant Khwaja<br />Jaffar had settled at in Balasore.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The carrying of extensive trade by merchants of Balasore must have<br />made the town prosperous as well as populous. The business</p></blockquote>
<p>transactions carried out concerning textile industry witnessed influx<br />of different class of people. Method of procurement of textiles was<br />similar to other parts of India[xv]. There was advance payment system<br />known as dadni. After receiving advance, the intermediaries on<br />paikars gave the amount to the weavers. The broker or dalal was link<br />between the intermediary and merchant. Sometimes, the rich investors<br />operated through agent or gumasta. The Dutch had salaried brokers and<br />the English were paying brokerage charge or dasturi to the dalal . <br />There was no direct link between the weavers and European factors. <br />The condition of weavers was far from satisfactory, as they were<br />indebted to the intermediaries. Hamlets of weavers and artisans<br />developed around English factory. Balasore became new habitat for<br />this migrant class from surrounding areas. </p>
<blockquote><p>  They did not have any control over the sell of the product.<br />  Balasore and its hinterland were centre of manufacture and<br />production of different commodities. Orissa was producing both</p></blockquote>
<p>agricultural and non-agricultural goods in excess, so the surplus was<br />exported to different parts of India and abroad. Balasore was linked<br />vertically with the surrounding areas serving as a market for surplus<br />production. There was also horizontal linkage with different urban<br />centres, which supplied varieties of commodities to the port-town. <br />Balasore was the emporium of cotton yarn. The variety of piece-goods<br />manufactured in the surrounding regions were sahan (sannoe, plain<br />cotton good of ordinary quality), khasa (cossae, muslin of high<br />quality), nillae(cotton and silk mixed, generally of blue colour),<br />gingham (cotton mixed with tasar silk), doriya (striped muslin),<br />herba (tasar silk) and calico (white cloth of thick yarn). <br />Bleaching and dyeing of fabric was also done in Balasore.</p>
<blockquote><p>  In seventeenth century, rice was being cultivated in Balasore<br />district and its export to coastal India and neighbouring countries</p></blockquote>
<p>continued until the second half of nineteenth century. Alexander<br />Hamilton had referred to production of pulses and tobacco in<br />Balasore[xvi]. Beeswax, items made of stone, wheat, ghee and sesamum<br />oil were other products of Balasore. It was having a flourishing<br />liquor industry. Punch houses were prevalent in 1670s. Saltpetre, an<br />important ingredient for manufacture of gunpowder was being imported<br />from Patna through land-route passing Qasimbazar and Hugli. Sugar was<br />being produced in Udaiganj, Chandrakona, Goghat (presently in West<br />Bengal) and Ganjam. It was being brought to Balasore for export by<br />the English and Dutch companies. The English factors reported in 1650<br />that price of sugar in Balasore was 7.5 to 8 rupees per bale and it<br />increased in monsoon season to 11 to12 rupees[xvii]. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Shipbuilding was an important and developed industry in Balasore.<br />Economically it was a major sector of urban employment for craftsmen,</p></blockquote>
<p>blacksmiths and artisans. The Mughal nobility had invested in this<br />industry in 1640s. Need for naval defence and checking of Arkanese<br />piracy compelled the Mughal government to construct a shipbuilding<br />centre in Balasore. Availability of timber and iron from nearby<br />Nilgiri Hill facilitated the task. The Mughal subadar of Bengal,<br />Shaista Khan ordered naval construction in Balasore, Hugli and Jassore<br />[xviii]. Craftsmen and blacksmiths went to Balasore from Harishpur<br />port by the order of Sayid Muhammed, the Subadar of Orissa. Balasore<br />had also facilities for repair work as evident from repair of English<br />ships named Coaster and Endeavour[xix].</p>
<blockquote><p>  Balasore was visited by ships from Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia<br />(Aceh), Malaysia (Kedah) and Myanmar (Pegu, Arakan and Tennasserim). </p></blockquote>
<p>The merchants of Balasore had extensive coastal trade with ports of<br />Coromandel coast, Calcutta and Dhaka and occasionally with Malabar and<br />Gujrat. Cowrie was being imported from Maldives and Cochin China<br />(southern Vietnam). Bullion was a feature of import trade of Orissa by<br />the English. The import of silver from Japan was stopped due to low<br />exchange rate and from 1680s, the English imported it from Europe. <br />The Dutch and English were importing lead. Import of elephants to the<br />port-town of Balasore was a regular phenomenon. These were used in<br />religious processions and in the army as a means of transport. <br />Zamindars, rajas and nawabs purchased the elephants. Two ships<br />belonging to the king of Thailand brought elephants from Tennasserim<br />in 1679[xx]. The commodities that were being imported to Balasore<br />were precious metals, vermilion</p>
<blockquote><p>  quicksilver, European guns, tin, copper, nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper<br />and cloves. Items of export were piece goods, rice, wheat, pulses,</p></blockquote>
<p>ghee, oil, and sugar and gingelly seed. Commercial importance of<br />Balasore town could be attested from the fact that number of ships<br />recorded for Balasore was in preponderance[xxi].</p>
<blockquote><p>  In the eighteenth century documents, Balasore is not mentioned<br />frequently unlike Qasimbazar, Calcutta, Dhaka and Patna. The muslins</p></blockquote>
<p>of Bengal received a bigger market in England than the piece goods of<br />Balasore. A major settlement on the bank of river Hugli was necessary<br />due to easier communication with inland factories of Bengal. The<br />Court of Committee passed orders for transfer of headquarters on the<br />Bay from Balasore to Hugli, which was retained as chief settlement of<br />Bengal by Stryensham Master in 1675[xxii]. Importance of Calcutta<br />grew up after acquirement of Zamindari right from nawab in 1698 and<br />Balasore only looked into the requirement of ships calling there<br />before going to Bay of Bengal. The channel to the sea was silted up<br />and the mouth of river Budhabalanga became unsuitable for ships. <br />Distance between seashore and town increased by five kilometres. <br />Beginning from last decade of seventeenth century, the Mughal<br />aristocracy began to withdraw from</p>
<blockquote><p>  investment in shipping. The frequent change of naib nazims of<br />Orissa and local officials posed hindrance to trade as earlier</p></blockquote>
<p>privileges given to the English factors were interfered and new<br />demands were put forth. The repeated Maratha invasions from 1740s<br />onwards disrupted the hinterland of Balasore.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Though commercial activity declined in Balasore, it was not<br />completely abandoned. In the first few decades of eighteenth century,</p></blockquote>
<p>was importing cowry and in turn exporting rice. Iron, stone ware and<br />rice was being supplied to Calcutta in mid-eighteenth century. The<br />two Gingelly ports of Ganjam and Vizagpatam ferried grain to deficit<br />areas in the coast. Salt export to Bengal and Berar continued.<br />Contillo, Pipli, Soro, Bhadrak, Harishpur and Manikpatna functioned as<br />small towns. Cuttack retained some of its earlier importance. <br />However, all those activities were in a much-reduced scale. There was<br />general decline of Orissa's oceanic and coastal trade in eighteenth<br />century. Consequently, the urban centres of seventeenth century<br />gradually lost their significance.</p>
<blockquote><p>  There is no doubt that wealth in urban areas was derived from<br />rural surplus. But the unique character of towns was due to</p></blockquote>
<p>commercial exchange and in this way, urbanization was result of<br />developments happening on the seas. In case of the port-town of<br />Balasore and other urban centres similar thing happened. Towards the<br />second half of eighteenth century, rise of Calcutta fleet affected<br />fortunes of Balasore. The European companies and traders had made<br />inroads into the preserves of Indian merchants. Hinterland of port<br />towns became accessible to the English. Orissa responded to the<br />changing situation of Indian Ocean and there was decline of commercial<br />traffic from Balasore across the Bay of Bengal. Political<br />dismemberment of the state under colonial rule and the British<br />economic policy in Orissa sounded the final death-knell. Afterwards,<br />the colonial towns like Cuttack, Balasore, Sambalpur, Ganjam etc<br />responded in a different way to the changing pace. The administrative</p>
<blockquote><p>  measures of the colonial government resulted in change of social<br />structure, mobility in occupation, decline in indigenous craft etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>There were major changes in economy and society of colonial Orissa in<br />the context of colonial policy.</p>
