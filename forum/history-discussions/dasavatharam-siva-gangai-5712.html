<p>Abode of Chidambaram ! Finance Minister !</p>
<p>Soniaji flew and opened a Perani..</p>
<p>(Plastic) Chandra's close relative (Periappa ?) Kaviyogi <br />Suddhanantha Bharathi's school is there..</p>
<p>and Venkat's Kalayar koil nearby..</p>
<p>But do you know Satish, SIVA - GANGAI is not an Ordinary word..</p>
<p>full of indepth meaning ?</p>
<p>We can start from Mahendra Pallava's inscriptions in Rock fort - <br />Lalithankura Pallaveswaram - Trichy (ref Archieves pls)</p>
<p>anbudan - sps</p>

<blockquote><p>  Venkat,</p>
<p>  If you are talking about the bust size photo of Kamal and Asin with<br />  the lord, in traditional madisar, I think that photo is quite old. <br />I<br />  think that was released almost a year back.</p>
<p>  It does involve characters from 12th century, but Kamal's note is <br />its<br />  related to Space or something like that.</p>
<p>  As discussed, too much hype kuduthu kavukka poranga....</p>
<p>  But I used to wonder, why no period films in tamil off late?<br />  All we have is Veerapandiya kattabomman, Raja raja cholan etc, with<br />  half baked history. Why no attempt like Braveheart, Troy, 300 etc. </p>
<p>  suddenly i wanted to watch Sivagangai seemai last week and watched <br />in<br />  only for an hour or so. Not so impressive. But planning to watch<br />  fully. If I remember right, you were all praise for this move <br />earlier!!</p>

        <p>FANTASTIC,. thanks Vijay., sps<br />=========================</p>

<blockquote><p>    We can start from Mahendra Pallava's inscriptions in Rock fort - <br />    Lalithankura Pallaveswaram - Trichy (ref Archieves pls)</p>
<p>  <a href="http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article09.xml" title="http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article09.xml">http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article09.xml</a></p>
<p>  'Mahendra's contribution to the development of South Indian <br />culture <br />  is unparalleled in the field of art, music, painting and <br />literature. <br />  He is the pioneer in propagating cave architecture in the Tamil <br />  country. His wrok on music is well-known. Mattavilasa-prahasana <br />  composed by him is one of the best prahasanas in Sanskrit <br />  literature. His love of painting and his proficiency in the art is <br />  attested by his title Chitrakarapuli. Among the monuments he has <br />  left, the upper rock-cut cave at Thiruchirapalli, called <br />Lalitankura-<br />  Pallavesvara-grham, named after one of his titles, is unique and <br />is <br />  a landmark in the study of South Indian art and culture for it is <br />  here that the best representation of sculpture of Mahendra is <br />  noticed in the Gangadhara panel. There is here a unique example of <br />  Mahendra's inscription expressed in ornate poetry. The second <br />verse <br />  of this inscription has been a puzzle to students of history and <br />  art. It is in this he mentios that he embraced Saivism from some <br />  other faith. <br />  A study of the second verse of Mahendra's inscription in this cave <br />  is as much fascinating as it is important for the study of Siva <br />  worship in South India. A re-examination of this verse is all the <br />  more necessary since some recent writers have suggested that the <br />  installation of Sivalinga in the snactum sanctorum as the <br />principal <br />  object of worship was unknown in the time of Mahendra. If the <br />  meaning of the second verse of Thiruchirapalli rock-cut cave is <br />once <br />  properly understood, all doubts regarding the worship of Linga <br />  during the reign of Mahendra will be set at rest. <br />  The verse under discussion reads as follows: <br />  Gunabhara-namani raja- nyanena lingena lingini jnanam Prathatam <br />  ciraya loke vipaksavrtteh paravrttam In the verse under <br />discussion, <br />  that slesha (double entendre) is employed is patent. There are <br />  therefore necessarily two meanings which are to be understood <br />here. <br />  The words Linga, Lingin, Jnana and Vipaksa have two meanings. <br />Linga <br />  seems Sivalinga and Linga means also hetu, reason, middle term or <br />  probans in an Inference. Since the word is employed in slesha, <br />both <br />  the meanings should be taken into account and one of the two viz., <br />  Sivalinga, should not be rejected as is done by the protogonists <br />of <br />  the view that Linga worship was not prevalent during the time of <br />  Mahendravarman I. It is not only the word Linga that is used here <br />in <br />  slesha but the whole verse is, as stated above, in slesha giving <br />  rise to two meanings. If one meaning alone is accepted and the <br />other <br />  rejected, it would mean that the composition is faulty. When the <br />  second import is quite meaningful, to brand this verse as a faulty <br />  composition will not be proper. Hence in this case both the <br />meanings <br />  have to be accepted. <br />  The first meaning of the verse is as follows: anena lingena: <br />Through <br />  the Sivalinga (established) here. Gunabhara-namani rajani: in the <br />  king named Gunabhara, lingini: who bears the Linga (i.e. <br />constantly <br />  adores Siva) jnanam: the knowledge vipakshavretteh paravrttam: <br />that <br />  he has turned away from the hostile faith loke chiraya prathatam: <br />  let it become well known in the world for long. <br />  There is a clear reference here to Mahendra's conversion, from <br />  Jainism to Saivism in the words Vipakshavrtteh paravrttam. There <br />is <br />  also an unequivocal reference to the worship of Sivalinga in the <br />  terms Linga and Lingin, Lingin meaning one who bears the Linga, <br />i.e. <br />  worships Linga. <br />  The second meaning of the verse will become evident when it is <br />  understood in terms of the process of inference, (1. Inferential <br />  cognition is accepted as a valid cognition by all systems of <br />Indian <br />  philosophy. A syllogism employed in this process of cognition <br />  comprises the following elements: <br />  (1) Hetu or Linga or the probans or the reason or the middle term <br />  e.g. smoke (2) Sadhya or Lingin the probandum or major term which <br />is <br />  to be established, e.g. fire. (3) Paksha the subject in which the <br />  probandum is not known and is to be proved, e.g. a mountain as <br />  having fire when smoke which is noticed is relied upon as the <br />  probans. (4) Sapaksha a similar instance in which the probandum is <br />  known for certain, e.g. hearth where smoke and fire had been seen <br />  together invariably. (5) Vipaksha a counter example in which the <br />non-<br />  existence of the probandum is known for certain e.g., a tank where <br />  neither fire nor its concomittant smoke is known) The elements of <br />  the inference are stated here in the terminology of prachina <br />  (ancient) nyaya and not of modern logic. According to Gautama, the <br />  author of the Nyaya sutras, the first limb of a syllogism, the <br />  statement of the thesis called Pratijna is given as Sadhya-nidresa <br />  and this includes the minor and major term. (1. See also <br />  Mudrarakshasa Nataka, V. 10 Sadhye nischitam etc.) The invariable <br />  relation between the Linga or probans or middle term, in this case <br />  between the Sivalinga established by the King in that temple, and <br />  the Lingin, the major term, viz., the knowledge of Siva as <br />existing <br />  in the King (the paksha or minor term) should be free from any <br />flaw; <br />  one of the flaws which would vitiate the inference is the presence <br />  of this in a counter-example; i.e., it should be vipaksha-<br />vyavrtta; <br />  in the present case, this Sivalinga and knowledge and devotion to <br />  the same are absent from Jainism. (2. I am thankful to my <br />Professor, <br />  Dr. Raghavan, for clarifying the meaning of the verse, on the side <br />  of logic.) <br />  King Mahendravikrama was evidently a lover of logic. Along with <br />the <br />  other well-known titles related to his artistic activities <br />  Chettakari, Sankirnajati and Chitrakarapuli, he assumed a <br />  significant title to commemorate his love for logic, viz., <br />Anumana. <br />  This title is recorded in the middle of the second pillar in the <br />  same cave temple of Tiruchirapalli. The same is also mentioned in <br />  the Pallavaram cave of Mahendra where besides the title Anumana, <br />the <br />  title Upamana is also noticed which again proves his love for <br />logic. <br />  Thus we may say that in the second meaning of the verse, the King <br />  himself is inferred as Anumana. <br />  According to Sekkilar, a 12th century poet, the Saivite saint <br />Appar, <br />  also known as Tirunavukkarasu, was a contemporary of a Pallava <br />  monarch whom he converted to Saivism. All evidences point to the <br />  fact that Appar lived in the 7th Century CE. Mahendra I, Narasimha <br />  I, Mahendra II and Paramesvaravarman I were the Pallava monarchs <br />who <br />  ruled in the 7th Century CE. <br />  It is only in the Trichy inscription of Mahendra I, we have a <br />  positive reference to his conversion to Saivism from some other <br />  faith, while the inscriptions of other monarchs portray them as <br />  great Saivites. Thus we have both epigraphical and literary <br />  references, pointing to the contemporaneity of Saint Appar and <br />  Mahendra. <br />  This is further substantiated by other evidences. <br />  In many of his verses, Appar mentions the worship of Siva in the <br />  form of linga.(inkurren enru lingatte tonrinanai) (lingapuranttu <br />  ullanai) <br />  It is therefore evident, that the worship of Siva in the form of <br />  Linga was well established long before the time of Appar and <br />  Mahendra. <br />  Thus the second verse of Mahendra, at Tiruchirapalli, is of <br />historic <br />  interest. It refers to the conversion of Mahendra to Saivism. It <br />  illustrates his love for logic and above all it points to the <br />state <br />  of Saivism in Tamil country in early 7th century CE." <br />  Hultsch's interpretation <br />  Lockwood and V. Bhatt have brought out three points in their <br />article <br />  on 'the Philosophy of Mahendra' and state that:- <br />  1. "Hultsch in his translation has wrongly interpreted the <br />sanskrit <br />  word 'nidhaya' and says that King Mahendra 'placed' an image of <br />Siva <br />  in the cave temple. 2. Hultsch did not understand that when <br />Mahendra <br />  had the figure of Siva Gangadhara carved, the figure was also <br />  fashioned as a portrait or representation of the King himself and <br />3. <br />  The expression, the daughter of the mountain actually refers to <br />  goddess Ganga who is depicted in the panel and not to Parvathi as <br />  all scholars have been assuming since Hultsch's day." (P.91-92) <br />  Regarding item I, the word Nidhaya - i.e. placed, Hultsch has <br />given <br />  the meaning of the word, and is absolutely justified in his <br />meaning <br />  (See Monier William on the word Nidhaya). <br />  Regarding the third point, Hultsch and others held that there are <br />  three girls in the picture. One is that beautiful girl (river) <br />  Kaveri, the second is the girl (river) Ganga and the third is <br />  Parvathi. Siva as Gangadhara is already attached to Ganga. <br />according <br />  to the verse Parvathi cannot bear the claim of another rival to <br />his <br />  love in the from of Kaveri. So she runs to this abode from <br />Himalayas <br />  and diverts Siva's attention. <br />  This view cannot be held wrong, for this is fully borne out by the <br />  inscription. Parvathi expressing her displeasure at the presence <br />of <br />  Ganga and Siva appeasing her as Gauriprasada is depicted in <br />  thousands of sculptures and literary compositions. The <br />introduction <br />  of three maidens as rivals, by Mahendra, certainly hightens the <br />  charm and aesthetic delight, quite in confirmity with the literary <br />  taste of the country. Further the very fact that a separate <br />  garbhagraha has been excavated by Mahendra, shows that some form <br />of <br />  Siva, which (incidentally) would be the main deity, to which at <br />  least a part of the inscription refers. <br />  The second point, relating to the identity of Mahendra with <br />  Gangadhara is discussed in detail here. In the Gangadhara panel, <br />  certain features exist which are persistantly ignored by the above <br />  writers. Apart from the central panel of Gangadhara, there are two <br />  human-figures seated one on either side of Siva. Both of them are <br />  shown holding their hand in adoration of the central figure and <br />  bending their head slightly in supplication. It is suggestive of <br />two <br />  points, (1) The central figure of Siva, stands above the head of <br />  these figures and (2) The human figures are bowing down to the <br />Lord. <br />  It is against this background two of the verses in this <br />inscription <br />  should be understood. <br />  Sailendra murdhani silabhavane vichitre Sailin tanum gunabharo <br />  Nrpatih nidhaya Sthanum vyadhatta Vidhiresha yathartha samjnam <br />  Sthanur svayamca saha tena jagatsu jatah. <br />  King Gunabhara having placed the stone image in this charming <br />stone <br />  temple, on top of the glorious mountain, set the meaning of the <br />term <br />  Sthanu (Siva) true, and it is quite appropriate that he has also <br />  became Sthanu (permanent) in this world. The term "Sthanu" has two <br />  mwanings namely Siva and permanent. <br />  This verse nowhere says that Mahendra merged with the image of <br />Siva <br />  and is reflected in the figure of Siva. On the contrary it <br />  specifically states that he also became permanent "tena saha" i.e. <br />  along with Sthanu. His separate identity is not only retained but <br />  also emphasised. <br />  The other verse reads <br />  Krtva sivam sirasai dharayati atma samstham Uccaih ciratvam <br />acalasya <br />  krtam krtartam. <br />  Having made (the image of) Siva who was residing in his heart <br />(atma) <br />  now bears him on his head. By this, he made the meaning 'that Siva <br />  stands on his head appropriate. <br />  There is also a second meaning rfering to the mountain (acala). <br />The <br />  term "Acala" is used in double meaning here - Acala means mountain <br />  and also immovavable image. The term uccaih ciras used here also <br />  suggests two meanings namely- lofty peak and above the head. That <br />by <br />  this the mountain with its peak and Siva who stands above the head <br />  of the human figures in the sculpture quite appropriately has <br />became <br />  lofty. <br />  In this verse also there is no mention of Mahendra being <br />identified <br />  with the figure Gangadhara. On the contrary there is a specific <br />  reference to Siva who was in his heart, is now borne on his head. <br />  Bearing Siva on his head is only a figurative expression and it <br />  means that he has become an ardent devotee. <br />  It is in this connection the human figures shown at the feet of <br />the <br />  Gangadhara image assume significance. The figures are suggestive <br />of <br />  bearing Siva on their head. That he stands above their head is <br />  suggested by the verse is also evident. <br />  Sculpturally the seated figures (one of them or both being the <br />  reflection of the same), admirably confirm to the meaning of the <br />  verse of the inscriptions and probably represents the portrait of <br />  Mahendra. So the seated figure, (Mahendra), bears Siva on his <br />head, <br />  becomes meaningful. Figuratively, Mahendra became an ardent <br />devotee <br />  of Siva is suggested by the verse. <br />  The usage, "I bear the Lord on my head" is an oft repeated <br />  expression in Saiva Siddhanta philosophy. Any elementary book on <br />  Saiva Siddhanta system will explain this concept. It is also <br />  called "Thiruvadi diksha", in Tamil (Sanskrit: Sripada diksha). On <br />  the physical level the devotee supplicates before his teacher <br />whose <br />  feet touches the head of the disciple. Symbolically the desciple <br />  carries the sandals of the preceptor on his head, a tradition <br />known <br />  to all the Hindus. Metaphysically when the Lord bestows grace on <br />the <br />  devotee, which makes him mature or ripe in his devotion, it is <br />  called Thiruvadi diksha. The literal meaning is "Intiation through <br />  sacred feet". This is obtained by the devotee from the Lord <br />himself <br />  psychologically or through one's preceptor. That great Saivite <br />saint <br />  Appar received this Thiruvadi diksha from the Lord (placing the <br />feet <br />  of Lord over the head of the devotee) is mentioned in many of his <br />  own Tevarams. <br />  Such usage is uttered both in the figurative sense and actual <br />sense. <br />  There are instances where the devotee carried either a Linga or <br />the <br />  pair of sandal on the head. There are sculptures which actually <br />show <br />  the ruler carrying the pair of sandals of Siva on their head. A <br />  recent find shows a royal figure carrying such sandals. In the <br />  Gangadhara panel, Siva is not shown on the head, but is certainly <br />  suggested, being borne on the head of the seated figures. There is <br />  not even the remotest suggestion that Mahendra is identified with <br />  the standing Siva. In our opinion Hultsch has not misinterpreted <br />the <br />  verses, but has given the simple straight forward meanings. <br />  The authors also seem to confuse the meaning of dhvani (which they <br />  translate as alternate meaning) with slesha. Dhvani is that which <br />is <br />  suggested; slesha is that which gives double meaning. In the verse <br />  under discussion, the intention of the poet is to give double <br />  meaning and so it falls under the category of slesha. As these are <br />  elementary exercises known to Sanskritists, and Hultsch, an <br />eminent <br />  Sanskritist he was, has given the meaning of the verses in the <br />right <br />  perspective. (1. We do welcome academic discussions on various <br />  views, or subjects and postulation of diametrically opposite views <br />  which is essential for the proper appreciation of the subject, <br />  However we prefer a sobre approach, especially in dealing with the <br />  views of pioneering and eminent scholars like Hultsch, whose <br />  contribution to our knowledge of South Indian Epigraphy is <br />  unparalleled to the views of Michael Lockwood and Bhat who do not <br />  even know the simple basic difference between slesha, and dhvani.)</p>

<p>'Mahendra's contribution to the development of South Indian culture <br />is unparalleled in the field of art, music, painting and literature. <br />He is the pioneer in propagating cave architecture in the Tamil <br />country. His wrok on music is well-known. Mattavilasa-prahasana <br />composed by him is one of the best prahasanas in Sanskrit <br />literature. His love of painting and his proficiency in the art is <br />attested by his title Chitrakarapuli. Among the monuments he has <br />left, the upper rock-cut cave at Thiruchirapalli, called Lalitankura-<br />Pallavesvara-grham, named after one of his titles, is unique and is <br />a landmark in the study of South Indian art and culture for it is <br />here that the best representation of sculpture of Mahendra is <br />noticed in the Gangadhara panel. There is here a unique example of <br />Mahendra's inscription expressed in ornate poetry. The second verse <br />of this inscription has been a puzzle to students of history and <br />art. It is in this he mentios that he embraced Saivism from some <br />other faith. <br />A study of the second verse of Mahendra's inscription in this cave <br />is as much fascinating as it is important for the study of Siva <br />worship in South India. A re-examination of this verse is all the <br />more necessary since some recent writers have suggested that the <br />installation of Sivalinga in the snactum sanctorum as the principal <br />object of worship was unknown in the time of Mahendra. If the <br />meaning of the second verse of Thiruchirapalli rock-cut cave is once <br />properly understood, all doubts regarding the worship of Linga <br />during the reign of Mahendra will be set at rest. <br />The verse under discussion reads as follows: <br />Gunabhara-namani raja- nyanena lingena lingini jnanam Prathatam <br />ciraya loke vipaksavrtteh paravrttam In the verse under discussion, <br />that slesha (double entendre) is employed is patent. There are <br />therefore necessarily two meanings which are to be understood here. <br />The words Linga, Lingin, Jnana and Vipaksa have two meanings. Linga <br />seems Sivalinga and Linga means also hetu, reason, middle term or <br />probans in an Inference. Since the word is employed in slesha, both <br />the meanings should be taken into account and one of the two viz., <br />Sivalinga, should not be rejected as is done by the protogonists of <br />the view that Linga worship was not prevalent during the time of <br />Mahendravarman I. It is not only the word Linga that is used here in <br />slesha but the whole verse is, as stated above, in slesha giving <br />rise to two meanings. If one meaning alone is accepted and the other <br />rejected, it would mean that the composition is faulty. When the <br />second import is quite meaningful, to brand this verse as a faulty <br />composition will not be proper. Hence in this case both the meanings <br />have to be accepted. <br />The first meaning of the verse is as follows: anena lingena: Through <br />the Sivalinga (established) here. Gunabhara-namani rajani: in the <br />king named Gunabhara, lingini: who bears the Linga (i.e. constantly <br />adores Siva) jnanam: the knowledge vipakshavretteh paravrttam: that <br />he has turned away from the hostile faith loke chiraya prathatam: <br />let it become well known in the world for long. <br />There is a clear reference here to Mahendra's conversion, from <br />Jainism to Saivism in the words Vipakshavrtteh paravrttam. There is <br />also an unequivocal reference to the worship of Sivalinga in the <br />terms Linga and Lingin, Lingin meaning one who bears the Linga, i.e. <br />worships Linga. <br />The second meaning of the verse will become evident when it is <br />understood in terms of the process of inference, (1. Inferential <br />cognition is accepted as a valid cognition by all systems of Indian <br />philosophy. A syllogism employed in this process of cognition <br />comprises the following elements: <br />(1) Hetu or Linga or the probans or the reason or the middle term <br />e.g. smoke (2) Sadhya or Lingin the probandum or major term which is <br />to be established, e.g. fire. (3) Paksha the subject in which the <br />probandum is not known and is to be proved, e.g. a mountain as <br />having fire when smoke which is noticed is relied upon as the <br />probans. (4) Sapaksha a similar instance in which the probandum is <br />known for certain, e.g. hearth where smoke and fire had been seen <br />together invariably. (5) Vipaksha a counter example in which the non-<br />existence of the probandum is known for certain e.g., a tank where <br />neither fire nor its concomittant smoke is known) The elements of <br />the inference are stated here in the terminology of prachina <br />(ancient) nyaya and not of modern logic. According to Gautama, the <br />author of the Nyaya sutras, the first limb of a syllogism, the <br />statement of the thesis called Pratijna is given as Sadhya-nidresa <br />and this includes the minor and major term. (1. See also <br />Mudrarakshasa Nataka, V. 10 Sadhye nischitam etc.) The invariable <br />relation between the Linga or probans or middle term, in this case <br />between the Sivalinga established by the King in that temple, and <br />the Lingin, the major term, viz., the knowledge of Siva as existing <br />in the King (the paksha or minor term) should be free from any flaw; <br />one of the flaws which would vitiate the inference is the presence <br />of this in a counter-example; i.e., it should be vipaksha-vyavrtta; <br />in the present case, this Sivalinga and knowledge and devotion to <br />the same are absent from Jainism. (2. I am thankful to my Professor, <br />Dr. Raghavan, for clarifying the meaning of the verse, on the side <br />of logic.) <br />King Mahendravikrama was evidently a lover of logic. Along with the <br />other well-known titles related to his artistic activities <br />Chettakari, Sankirnajati and Chitrakarapuli, he assumed a <br />significant title to commemorate his love for logic, viz., Anumana. <br />This title is recorded in the middle of the second pillar in the <br />same cave temple of Tiruchirapalli. The same is also mentioned in <br />the Pallavaram cave of Mahendra where besides the title Anumana, the <br />title Upamana is also noticed which again proves his love for logic. <br />Thus we may say that in the second meaning of the verse, the King <br />himself is inferred as Anumana. <br />According to Sekkilar, a 12th century poet, the Saivite saint Appar, <br />also known as Tirunavukkarasu, was a contemporary of a Pallava <br />monarch whom he converted to Saivism. All evidences point to the <br />fact that Appar lived in the 7th Century CE. Mahendra I, Narasimha <br />I, Mahendra II and Paramesvaravarman I were the Pallava monarchs who <br />ruled in the 7th Century CE. <br />It is only in the Trichy inscription of Mahendra I, we have a <br />positive reference to his conversion to Saivism from some other <br />faith, while the inscriptions of other monarchs portray them as <br />great Saivites. Thus we have both epigraphical and literary <br />references, pointing to the contemporaneity of Saint Appar and <br />Mahendra. <br />This is further substantiated by other evidences. <br />In many of his verses, Appar mentions the worship of Siva in the <br />form of linga.(inkurren enru lingatte tonrinanai) (lingapuranttu <br />ullanai) <br />It is therefore evident, that the worship of Siva in the form of <br />Linga was well established long before the time of Appar and <br />Mahendra. <br />Thus the second verse of Mahendra, at Tiruchirapalli, is of historic <br />interest. It refers to the conversion of Mahendra to Saivism. It <br />illustrates his love for logic and above all it points to the state <br />of Saivism in Tamil country in early 7th century CE." <br />Hultsch's interpretation <br />Lockwood and V. Bhatt have brought out three points in their article <br />on 'the Philosophy of Mahendra' and state that:- <br />1. "Hultsch in his translation has wrongly interpreted the sanskrit <br />word 'nidhaya' and says that King Mahendra 'placed' an image of Siva <br />in the cave temple. 2. Hultsch did not understand that when Mahendra <br />had the figure of Siva Gangadhara carved, the figure was also <br />fashioned as a portrait or representation of the King himself and 3. <br />The expression, the daughter of the mountain actually refers to <br />goddess Ganga who is depicted in the panel and not to Parvathi as <br />all scholars have been assuming since Hultsch's day." (P.91-92) <br />Regarding item I, the word Nidhaya - i.e. placed, Hultsch has given <br />the meaning of the word, and is absolutely justified in his meaning <br />(See Monier William on the word Nidhaya). <br />Regarding the third point, Hultsch and others held that there are <br />three girls in the picture. One is that beautiful girl (river) <br />Kaveri, the second is the girl (river) Ganga and the third is <br />Parvathi. Siva as Gangadhara is already attached to Ganga. according <br />to the verse Parvathi cannot bear the claim of another rival to his <br />love in the from of Kaveri. So she runs to this abode from Himalayas <br />and diverts Siva's attention. <br />This view cannot be held wrong, for this is fully borne out by the <br />inscription. Parvathi expressing her displeasure at the presence of <br />Ganga and Siva appeasing her as Gauriprasada is depicted in <br />thousands of sculptures and literary compositions. The introduction <br />of three maidens as rivals, by Mahendra, certainly hightens the <br />charm and aesthetic delight, quite in confirmity with the literary <br />taste of the country. Further the very fact that a separate <br />garbhagraha has been excavated by Mahendra, shows that some form of <br />Siva, which (incidentally) would be the main deity, to which at <br />least a part of the inscription refers. <br />The second point, relating to the identity of Mahendra with <br />Gangadhara is discussed in detail here. In the Gangadhara panel, <br />certain features exist which are persistantly ignored by the above <br />writers. Apart from the central panel of Gangadhara, there are two <br />human-figures seated one on either side of Siva. Both of them are <br />shown holding their hand in adoration of the central figure and <br />bending their head slightly in supplication. It is suggestive of two <br />points, (1) The central figure of Siva, stands above the head of <br />these figures and (2) The human figures are bowing down to the Lord. <br />It is against this background two of the verses in this inscription <br />should be understood. <br />Sailendra murdhani silabhavane vichitre Sailin tanum gunabharo <br />Nrpatih nidhaya Sthanum vyadhatta Vidhiresha yathartha samjnam <br />Sthanur svayamca saha tena jagatsu jatah. <br />King Gunabhara having placed the stone image in this charming stone <br />temple, on top of the glorious mountain, set the meaning of the term <br />Sthanu (Siva) true, and it is quite appropriate that he has also <br />became Sthanu (permanent) in this world. The term "Sthanu" has two <br />mwanings namely Siva and permanent. <br />This verse nowhere says that Mahendra merged with the image of Siva <br />and is reflected in the figure of Siva. On the contrary it <br />specifically states that he also became permanent "tena saha" i.e. <br />along with Sthanu. His separate identity is not only retained but <br />also emphasised. <br />The other verse reads <br />Krtva sivam sirasai dharayati atma samstham Uccaih ciratvam acalasya <br />krtam krtartam. <br />Having made (the image of) Siva who was residing in his heart (atma) <br />now bears him on his head. By this, he made the meaning 'that Siva <br />stands on his head appropriate. <br />There is also a second meaning rfering to the mountain (acala). The <br />term "Acala" is used in double meaning here - Acala means mountain <br />and also immovavable image. The term uccaih ciras used here also <br />suggests two meanings namely- lofty peak and above the head. That by <br />this the mountain with its peak and Siva who stands above the head <br />of the human figures in the sculpture quite appropriately has became <br />lofty. <br />In this verse also there is no mention of Mahendra being identified <br />with the figure Gangadhara. On the contrary there is a specific <br />reference to Siva who was in his heart, is now borne on his head. <br />Bearing Siva on his head is only a figurative expression and it <br />means that he has become an ardent devotee. <br />It is in this connection the human figures shown at the feet of the <br />Gangadhara image assume significance. The figures are suggestive of <br />bearing Siva on their head. That he stands above their head is <br />suggested by the verse is also evident. <br />Sculpturally the seated figures (one of them or both being the <br />reflection of the same), admirably confirm to the meaning of the <br />verse of the inscriptions and probably represents the portrait of <br />Mahendra. So the seated figure, (Mahendra), bears Siva on his head, <br />becomes meaningful. Figuratively, Mahendra became an ardent devotee <br />of Siva is suggested by the verse. <br />The usage, "I bear the Lord on my head" is an oft repeated <br />expression in Saiva Siddhanta philosophy. Any elementary book on <br />Saiva Siddhanta system will explain this concept. It is also <br />called "Thiruvadi diksha", in Tamil (Sanskrit: Sripada diksha). On <br />the physical level the devotee supplicates before his teacher whose <br />feet touches the head of the disciple. Symbolically the desciple <br />carries the sandals of the preceptor on his head, a tradition known <br />to all the Hindus. Metaphysically when the Lord bestows grace on the <br />devotee, which makes him mature or ripe in his devotion, it is <br />called Thiruvadi diksha. The literal meaning is "Intiation through <br />sacred feet". This is obtained by the devotee from the Lord himself <br />psychologically or through one's preceptor. That great Saivite saint <br />Appar received this Thiruvadi diksha from the Lord (placing the feet <br />of Lord over the head of the devotee) is mentioned in many of his <br />own Tevarams. <br />Such usage is uttered both in the figurative sense and actual sense. <br />There are instances where the devotee carried either a Linga or the <br />pair of sandal on the head. There are sculptures which actually show <br />the ruler carrying the pair of sandals of Siva on their head. A <br />recent find shows a royal figure carrying such sandals. In the <br />Gangadhara panel, Siva is not shown on the head, but is certainly <br />suggested, being borne on the head of the seated figures. There is <br />not even the remotest suggestion that Mahendra is identified with <br />the standing Siva. In our opinion Hultsch has not misinterpreted the <br />verses, but has given the simple straight forward meanings. <br />The authors also seem to confuse the meaning of dhvani (which they <br />translate as alternate meaning) with slesha. Dhvani is that which is <br />suggested; slesha is that which gives double meaning. In the verse <br />under discussion, the intention of the poet is to give double <br />meaning and so it falls under the category of slesha. As these are <br />elementary exercises known to Sanskritists, and Hultsch, an eminent <br />Sanskritist he was, has given the meaning of the verses in the right <br />perspective. (1. We do welcome academic discussions on various <br />views, or subjects and postulation of diametrically opposite views <br />which is essential for the proper appreciation of the subject, <br />However we prefer a sobre approach, especially in dealing with the <br />views of pioneering and eminent scholars like Hultsch, whose <br />contribution to our knowledge of South Indian Epigraphy is <br />unparalleled to the views of Michael Lockwood and Bhat who do not <br />even know the simple basic difference between slesha, and dhvani.) </p>
