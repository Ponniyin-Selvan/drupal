</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>SHIPBUILDING FROM ANCIENT INDIA </p>
<p>Sanskrit and Pali literature has innumerable references to the <br />maritime activity of Indians in ancient times. There is also one <br />treatise in Sanskrit, named Yukti Kalpa Taru which has been compiled <br />by a person called Bhoja Narapati. </p>
<p>(The Yukti Kalpa Taru (YKT) had been translated and published by <br />Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit Manu scripts.   </p>
<p>This treatise gives a technocratic exposition on the technique of <br />shipbuilding. It sets forth minute details about the various types of <br />ships, their sizes, the materials from which they were built. The <br />Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all the available <br />information </p>
<p>The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient information and date to prove <br />that in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a good knowledge of <br />the materials which were used in building ships. Apart from <br />describing the qualities of the different types of wood and their <br />suitablility in shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa Taru also gives an <br />elaborate classification of ships based on their size. </p>
<p>The primary division is into 2 classes viz. Samanya (ordinary) and <br />Vishesha (Special). The ordinary type for sea voyages. Ships that <br />undertook sea voyages were classified into, Dirgha type of ships <br />which had a long and narrow hull and the Unnata type of ships which <br />had a higher hull. </p>
<p>The treatise also gives elaborate directions for decorating and <br />furnishing the ships with a view to making them comfortable for <br />passengers. Also mentioned are details about the internal seating and <br />accommodation to be provided on the ships. Three classes of ships are <br />distinguished according to their length and the position of cabins. <br />The ships having cabins extending from one end of the deck to the <br />other are called Sarvamandira vessels. </p>
<p>These ships are recommended for the transport of royal treasure and <br />horses. The next are the Madhyamarnandira vessels which have cabins <br />only in the middle part of their deck. these vessels are recommended <br />for pleasure trips. And finally there is a category of Agramandira <br />vessels, these ships were used mainly in warfare. </p>
<p>MACCHA-YANTRA - THE ANCIENT INDIAN MARINER'S COMPASS </p>
<p>Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many parts of a ship. The <br />ship's anchor was known as Nava-Bandhan-Kilaha which literally <br />means 'A Nail to tie up a ship' . The sail was called Vata Vastra a <br />which means 'wind-cloth'. </p>
<p>The hull was termed StulaBhaga i.e. an'expanded area'. The rudder was <br />called Keni-Pata, Pata means blade; the rudder was also known as <br />Karna which literally means a 'ear' and was so called because it used <br />to be a hollow curved blade, as is found today in exhaust fans. The <br />ship's keel was called Nava-Tala which means 'bottom of a ship'. The <br />mast was known as Kupadanda, in which danda means a pole. </p>
<p>Even a sextant was used for navigation and was called Vruttashanga-<br />Bhaga. But what is more surprising is that even a contrived mariner's <br />compass was used by Indian navigators nearly 1500 to 2000 years ago. <br />This claim is not being made in an overzealous nationalistic spirit. <br />This has in fact been the suggestion of an European expert, Mr. J.L. <br />Reid, who was a member of the Institute of Naval Architects and Ship <br />builders in England at around the beginning of the present century. <br />This is what Mr. Reid has said in the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. xiii., <br />Part ii., Appendix A. </p>
<p>"The early Hindu astrologers are said to have used the magnet, in <br />fixing the North and East, in laying foundations, and other religious <br />ceremonies. </p>
<p>The Hindu compass was an iron fish that floated in a vessel of oil <br />and pointed to the North. The fact of this older Hindu compass seems <br />placed beyond doubt by the Sanskrit word Maccha Yantra, or fish <br />machine, which Molesworth gives as a name for the mariner's compass". </p>
<p>It is significant to note that these are the words of a foreign Naval <br />Architect and Shipbuilding Expert. Is is thus quite possible that the <br />Maccha Yantra (fish machine) was transmitted to the west by the Arabs <br />to give us the mariner's compass of today. </p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I remember my father-in-law talking about such a state of affairs(idli for diwali) for him during his childhood days.. I dont think Tamilnadu has dramatically improved, until the villages are far removed from poverty.. :( </p>

<p>Oh my God!!! Idli only for Deepawali is so sad.<br />Sometimes I wonder maybe the Kings of the bygone era<br />could have fed our population in a better way. </p>
<p>But I can't stop wondering what thier military rations<br />were. They had to walk, run, fight in hand to hand<br />combat...... ....kanji. ......... too weak......maybe<br />meat on hoof?</p>

<p>      SHIPBUILDING FROM ANCIENT INDIA </p>
<p>      Sanskrit and Pali literature has innumerable<br />      references to the <br />      maritime activity of Indians in ancient times.<br />  There<br />      is also one <br />      treatise in Sanskrit, named Yukti Kalpa Taru<br />  which<br />      has been compiled <br />      by a person called Bhoja Narapati. </p>
<p>      (The Yukti Kalpa Taru (YKT) had been translated<br />  and<br />      published by <br />      Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit<br />  Manu<br />      scripts. </p>
<p>      This treatise gives a technocratic exposition on<br />  the<br />      technique of <br />      shipbuilding. It sets forth minute details about<br />  the<br />      various types of <br />      ships, their sizes, the materials from which<br />  they<br />      were built. The <br />      Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all<br />  the<br />      available <br />      information </p>
<p>      The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient<br />  information<br />      and date to prove <br />      that in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a<br />      good knowledge of <br />      the materials which were used in building ships.<br />      Apart from <br />      describing the qualities of the different types<br />  of<br />      wood and their <br />      suitablility in shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa<br />  Taru<br />      also gives an <br />      elaborate classification of ships based on their<br />      size. </p>
<p>      The primary division is into 2 classes viz.<br />  Samanya<br />      (ordinary) and <br />      Vishesha (Special). The ordinary type for sea<br />      voyages. Ships that <br />      undertook sea voyages were classified into,<br />  Dirgha<br />      type of ships <br />      which had a long and narrow hull and the Unnata<br />  type<br />      of ships which <br />      had a higher hull. </p>
<p>      The treatise also gives elaborate directions for<br />      decorating and <br />      furnishing the ships with a view to making them<br />      comfortable for <br />      passengers. Also mentioned are details about the<br />      internal seating and <br />      accommodation to be provided on the ships. Three<br />      classes of ships are <br />      distinguished according to their length and the<br />      position of cabins. <br />      The ships having cabins extending from one end<br />  of<br />      the deck to the <br />      other are called Sarvamandira vessels. </p>
<p>      These ships are recommended for the transport of<br />      royal treasure and <br />      horses. The next are the Madhyamarnandira<br />  vessels<br />      which have cabins <br />      only in the middle part of their deck. these<br />  vessels<br />      are recommended <br />      for pleasure trips. And finally there is a<br />  category<br />      of Agramandira <br />      vessels, these ships were used mainly in<br />  warfare. </p>
<p>      MACCHA-YANTRA - THE ANCIENT INDIAN MARINER'S<br />  COMPASS</p>
<p>      Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many<br />      parts of a ship. The <br />      ship's anchor was known as Nava-Bandhan- Kilaha<br />  which</p>

<p>      (The Yukti Kalpa Taru (YKT) had been translated<br />  and<br />      published by <br />      Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit<br />  Manu<br />      scripts. </p>
<p>      This treatise gives a technocratic exposition on<br />  the<br />      technique of <br />      shipbuilding. It sets forth minute details about<br />  the<br />      various types of <br />      ships, their sizes, the materials from which<br />  they<br />      were built. The <br />      Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all<br />  the<br />      available <br />      information </p>
<p>      The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient<br />  information<br />      and date to prove <br />      that in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a<br />      good knowledge of <br />      the materials which were used in building ships.<br />      Apart from <br />      describing the qualities of the different types<br />  of<br />      wood and their <br />      suitablility in shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa<br />  Taru<br />      also gives an <br />      elaborate classification of ships based on their<br />      size. </p>
<p>      The primary division is into 2 classes viz.<br />  Samanya<br />      (ordinary) and <br />      Vishesha (Special). The ordinary type for sea<br />      voyages. Ships that <br />      undertook sea voyages were classified into,<br />  Dirgha<br />      type of ships <br />      which had a long and narrow hull and the Unnata<br />  type<br />      of ships which <br />      had a higher hull. </p>
<p>      The treatise also gives elaborate directions for<br />      decorating and <br />      furnishing the ships with a view to making them<br />      comfortable for <br />      passengers. Also mentioned are details about the<br />      internal seating and <br />      accommodation to be provided on the ships. Three<br />      classes of ships are <br />      distinguished according to their length and the<br />      position of cabins. <br />      The ships having cabins extending from one end<br />  of<br />      the deck to the <br />      other are called Sarvamandira vessels. </p>
<p>      These ships are recommended for the transport of<br />      royal treasure and <br />      horses. The next are the Madhyamarnandira<br />  vessels<br />      which have cabins <br />      only in the middle part of their deck. these<br />  vessels<br />      are recommended <br />      for pleasure trips. And finally there is a<br />  category<br />      of Agramandira <br />      vessels, these ships were used mainly in<br />  warfare. </p>

And finally there is a category<br />    of Agramandira <br />    vessels, these ships were used mainly in warfare. </p>
<p>    MACCHA-YANTRA - THE ANCIENT INDIAN MARINER'S COMPASS</p>
<p>    Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many<br />    parts of a ship. The <br />    ship's anchor was known as Nava-Bandhan-Kilaha which<br />    literally <br />    means 'A Nail to tie up a ship' . The sail was<br />    called Vata Vastra a <br />    which means 'wind-cloth'. </p>
<p>    The hull was termed StulaBhaga i.e. an'expanded<br />    area'. The rudder was <br />    called Keni-Pata, Pata means blade; the rudder was<br />    also known as <br />    Karna which literally means a 'ear' and was so<br />    called because it used <br />    to be a hollow curved blade, as is found today in<br />    exhaust fans. The <br />    ship's keel was called Nava-Tala which means 'bottom<br />    of a ship'. The <br />    mast was known as Kupadanda, in which danda means a<br />    pole. </p>
<p>    Even a sextant was used for navigation and was<br />    called Vruttashanga-<br />    Bhaga. But what is more surprising is that even a<br />    contrived mariner's <br />    compass was used by Indian navigators nearly 1500 to<br />    2000 years ago. <br />    This claim is not being made in an overzealous<br />    nationalistic spirit. <br />    This has in fact been the suggestion of an European<br />    expert, Mr. J.L. <br />    Reid, who was a member of the Institute of Naval<br />    Architects and Ship <br />    builders in England at around the beginning of the<br />    present century. <br />    This is what Mr. Reid has said in the Bombay<br />    Gazetteer, vol. xiii., <br />    Part ii., Appendix A. </p>
<p>    "The early Hindu astrologers are said to have used<br />    the magnet, in <br />    fixing the North and East, in laying foundations,<br />    and other religious <br />    ceremonies. </p>
<p>    The Hindu compass was an iron fish that floated in a<br />    vessel of oil <br />    and pointed to the North. The fact of this older<br />    Hindu compass seems <br />    placed beyond doubt by the Sanskrit word Maccha<br />    Yantra, or fish <br />    machine, which Molesworth gives as a name for the<br />    mariner's compass". </p>
<p>    It is significant to note that these are the words<br />    of a foreign Naval <br />    Architect and Shipbuilding Expert. Is is thus quite<br />    possible that the <br />    Maccha Yantra (fish machine) was transmitted to the<br />    west by the Arabs <br />    to give us the mariner's compass of today. </p>

<p>  Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many<br />  parts of a ship. The <br />  ship's anchor was known as Nava-Bandhan-Kilaha which<br />  literally <br />  means 'A Nail to tie up a ship' . The sail was<br />  called Vata Vastra a <br />  which means 'wind-cloth'. </p>
<p>  The hull was termed StulaBhaga i.e. an'expanded<br />  area'. The rudder was <br />  called Keni-Pata, Pata means blade; the rudder was<br />  also known as <br />  Karna which literally means a 'ear' and was so<br />  called because it used <br />  to be a hollow curved blade, as is found today in<br />  exhaust fans. The <br />  ship's keel was called Nava-Tala which means 'bottom<br />  of a ship'. The <br />  mast was known as Kupadanda, in which danda means a<br />  pole. </p>
<p>  Even a sextant was used for navigation and was<br />  called Vruttashanga-<br />  Bhaga. But what is more surprising is that even a<br />  contrived mariner's <br />  compass was used by Indian navigators nearly 1500 to<br />  2000 years ago. <br />  This claim is not being made in an overzealous<br />  nationalistic spirit. <br />  This has in fact been the suggestion of an European<br />  expert, Mr. J.L. <br />  Reid, who was a member of the Institute of Naval<br />  Architects and Ship <br />  builders in England at around the beginning of the<br />  present century. <br />  This is what Mr. Reid has said in the Bombay<br />  Gazetteer, vol. xiii., <br />  Part ii., Appendix A. </p>
<p>  "The early Hindu astrologers are said to have used<br />  the magnet, in <br />  fixing the North and East, in laying foundations,<br />  and other religious <br />  ceremonies. </p>
<p>  The Hindu compass was an iron fish that floated in a<br />  vessel of oil <br />  and pointed to the North. The fact of this older<br />  Hindu compass seems <br />  placed beyond doubt by the Sanskrit word Maccha<br />  Yantra, or fish <br />  machine, which Molesworth gives as a name for the<br />  mariner's compass". </p>
<p>  It is significant to note that these are the words<br />  of a foreign Naval <br />  Architect and Shipbuilding Expert.

<p>  SHIPBUILDING FROM ANCIENT INDIA </p>
<p>  Sanskrit and Pali literature has innumerable<br />  references to the <br />  maritime activity of Indians in ancient times. There<br />  is also one <br />  treatise in Sanskrit, named Yukti Kalpa Taru which<br />  has been compiled <br />  by a person called Bhoja Narapati. </p>
<p>  (The Yukti Kalpa Taru (YKT) had been translated and<br />  published by <br />  Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit Manu<br />  scripts. </p>
<p>  This treatise gives a technocratic exposition on the<br />  technique of <br />  shipbuilding. It sets forth minute details about the<br />  various types of <br />  ships, their sizes, the materials from which they<br />  were built. The <br />  Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all the<br />  available <br />  information </p>
<p>  The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient information<br />  and date to prove <br />  that in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a<br />  good knowledge of <br />  the materials which were used in building ships.<br />  Apart from <br />  describing the qualities of the different types of<br />  wood and their <br />  suitablility in shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa Taru<br />  also gives an <br />  elaborate classification of ships based on their<br />  size. </p>
<p>  The primary division is into 2 classes viz. Samanya<br />  (ordinary) and <br />  Vishesha (Special). The ordinary type for sea<br />  voyages. Ships that <br />  undertook sea voyages were classified into, Dirgha<br />  type of ships <br />  which had a long and narrow hull and the Unnata type<br />  of ships which <br />  had a higher hull. </p>
<p>  The treatise also gives elaborate directions for<br />  decorating and <br />  furnishing the ships with a view to making them<br />  comfortable for <br />  passengers. Also mentioned are details about the<br />  internal seating and <br />  accommodation to be provided on the ships. Three<br />  classes of ships are <br />  distinguished according to their length and the<br />  position of cabins. <br />  The ships having cabins extending from one end of<br />  the deck to the <br />  other are called Sarvamandira vessels. </p>
<p>  These ships are recommended for the transport of<br />  royal treasure and <br />  horses. The next are the Madhyamarnandira vessels<br />  which have cabins <br />  only in the middle part of their deck. these vessels<br />  are recommended <br />  for pleasure trips. And finally there is a category<br />  of Agramandira <br />  vessels, these ships were used mainly in warfare. </p>

<p>MACCHA-YANTRA - THE ANCIENT INDIAN MARINER'S COMPASS </p>
<p>Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many parts of a ship. The <br />ship's anchor was known as Nava-Bandhan-Kilaha which literally <br />means 'A Nail to tie up a ship' . The sail was called Vata Vastra a <br />which means 'wind-cloth'. </p>
<p>The hull was termed StulaBhaga i.e. an'expanded area'. The rudder was <br />called Keni-Pata, Pata means blade; the rudder was also known as <br />Karna which literally means a 'ear' and was so called because it used <br />to be a hollow curved blade, as is found today in exhaust fans. The <br />ship's keel was called Nava-Tala which means 'bottom of a ship'. The <br />mast was known as Kupadanda, in which danda means a pole. </p>
<p>Even a sextant was used for navigation and was called Vruttashanga-<br />Bhaga. But what is more surprising is that even a contrived mariner's <br />compass was used by Indian navigators nearly 1500 to 2000 years ago. <br />This claim is not being made in an overzealous nationalistic spirit. <br />This has in fact been the suggestion of an European expert, Mr. J.L. <br />Reid, who was a member of the Institute of Naval Architects and Ship <br />builders in England at around the beginning of the present century. <br />This is what Mr. Reid has said in the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. xiii., <br />Part ii., Appendix A. </p>
<p>"The early Hindu astrologers are said to have used the magnet, in <br />fixing the North and East, in laying foundations, and other religious <br />ceremonies. </p>
<p>The Hindu compass was an iron fish that floated in a vessel of oil <br />and pointed to the North. The fact of this older Hindu compass seems <br />placed beyond doubt by the Sanskrit word Maccha Yantra, or fish <br />machine, which Molesworth gives as a name for the mariner's compass". </p>
<p>It is significant to note that these are the words of a foreign Naval <br />Architect and Shipbuilding Expert. Is is thus quite possible that the <br />Maccha Yantra (fish machine) was transmitted to the west by the Arabs <br />to give us the mariner's compass of today. </p>

          SHIPBUILDING FROM ANCIENT INDIA        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Bala sir<br />That was excellent<br />Yo coulnt have send it at a more appropriate time than when we are discussing Sandilyan...Those who have read Kadal Pura would remember how Karunakaran Thondaimaan later famous for Kalingathu parani explains all this in his conversion of merchant ships to agramanthirams and quotes Yukthi Kalapatharu...as well</p>
<p>Sandilyan was also well versed in the technology of the tamils and greeks as he eloborates it in Yavanarani and Kadal Pura</p>
<p>Regards<br />Sri</p>
<p>"s.balasubramani" <kalinga_tamil@yahoo.co.in  wrote:</p>
<p>SHIPBUILDING FROM ANCIENT INDIA </p>
<p>Sanskrit and Pali literature has innumerable references to the <br />maritime activity of Indians in ancient times. There is also one <br />treatise in Sanskrit, named Yukti Kalpa Taru which has been compiled <br />by a person called Bhoja Narapati. </p>
<p>(The Yukti Kalpa Taru (YKT) had been translated and published by <br />Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit Manu scripts. </p>
<p>This treatise gives a technocratic exposition on the technique of <br />shipbuilding. It sets forth minute details about the various types of <br />ships, their sizes, the materials from which they were built. The <br />Yukti Kalpa Taru sums up in a condensed form all the available <br />information </p>
<p>The Yukti Kalpa Taru gives sufficient information and date to prove <br />that in ancient times, Indian shipbuilders had a good knowledge of <br />the materials which were used in building ships. Apart from <br />describing the qualities of the different types of wood and their <br />suitablility in shipbuilding, the Yukti Kalpa Taru also gives an <br />elaborate classification of ships based on their size. </p>
<p>The primary division is into 2 classes viz. Samanya (ordinary) and <br />Vishesha (Special). The ordinary type for sea voyages. Ships that <br />undertook sea voyages were classified into, Dirgha type of ships <br />which had a long and narrow hull and the Unnata type of ships which <br />had a higher hull. </p>
<p>The treatise also gives elaborate directions for decorating and <br />furnishing the ships with a view to making them comfortable for <br />passengers. Also mentioned are details about the internal seating and <br />accommodation to be provided on the ships. Three classes of ships are <br />distinguished according to their length and the position of cabins. <br />The ships having cabins extending from one end of the deck to the <br />other are called Sarvamandira vessels. </p>
<p>These ships are recommended for the transport of royal treasure and <br />horses. The next are the Madhyamarnandira vessels which have cabins <br />only in the middle part of their deck. these vessels are recommended <br />for pleasure trips. And finally there is a category of Agramandira <br />vessels, these ships were used mainly in warfare. </p>
<p>MACCHA-YANTRA - THE ANCIENT INDIAN MARINER'S COMPASS </p>
<p>Interestingly there were Sanskrit terms for many parts of a ship. The <br />ship's anchor was known as Nava-Bandhan-Kilaha which literally <br />means 'A Nail to tie up a ship' . The sail was called Vata Vastra a <br />which means 'wind-cloth'. </p>
<p>The hull was termed StulaBhaga i.e. an'expanded area'. The rudder was <br />called Keni-Pata, Pata means blade; the rudder was also known as <br />Karna which literally means a 'ear' and was so called because it used <br />to be a hollow curved blade, as is found today in exhaust fans. The <br />ship's keel was called Nava-Tala which means 'bottom of a ship'. The <br />mast was known as Kupadanda, in which danda means a pole. </p>
<p>Even a sextant was used for navigation and was called Vruttashanga-<br />Bhaga. But what is more surprising is that even a contrived mariner's <br />compass was used by Indian navigators nearly 1500 to 2000 years ago. <br />This claim is not being made in an overzealous nationalistic spirit. <br />This has in fact been the suggestion of an European expert, Mr. J.L. <br />Reid, who was a member of the Institute of Naval Architects and Ship <br />builders in England at around the beginning of the present century. <br />This is what Mr. Reid has said in the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. xiii., <br />Part ii., Appendix A. </p>
<p>"The early Hindu astrologers are said to have used the magnet, in <br />fixing the North and East, in laying foundations, and other religious <br />ceremonies. </p>
<p>The Hindu compass was an iron fish that floated in a vessel of oil <br />and pointed to the North. The fact of this older Hindu compass seems <br />placed beyond doubt by the Sanskrit word Maccha Yantra, or fish <br />machine, which Molesworth gives as a name for the mariner's compass". </p>
<p>It is significant to note that these are the words of a foreign Naval <br />Architect and Shipbuilding Expert. Is is thus quite possible that the <br />Maccha Yantra (fish machine) was transmitted to the west by the Arabs <br />to give us the mariner's compass of today. </p>
