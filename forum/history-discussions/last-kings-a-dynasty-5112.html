<p>I was curious to find out how many chola kings were on the throne in <br />their last century of rule</p>
<p>we expect many kings to have ruled during a period of decline. we <br />expect strife and warring within the family. but it was not so.</p>
<p>only 3 kings have ruled for the last 100 years</p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola III	1178-1218<br />Rajaraja Chola III	1216-1256<br />Rajendra Chola III	1246-1279</p>
<p>then I checked up with the mughals too</p>
<p>similarly only 4 kings have ruled in the last century of their rule.</p>
<p>Alamgir II, b. 1699, ruler 1754?59, <br />Shah Alam II, b. 1728, ruler 1759?1806, <br />Akbar Shah II, b. 1760, rulr 1806?37, <br />Bahadur Shah II aka Bahadur Shah Zafar, ruler from 1837?57,</p>
<p>does this tell us there is a link betwen longevity of the monarch and <br />the riot setting in??????</p>

<p>      And if it weren't for the British in the 1800's we would still <br />be<br />      thinking AK built Big Temple. thats completely laughable!!<br />      ------------------<br />      Rebrushing Memory ::</p>
<p>      Almost by mid 13th Century Pandia Rule in Tamilnadu came to an <br />    end..</p>
<p>      Moghul Rule in various parts ..</p>
<p>      In mid 15th Century, Vijayanagara Kingdom .. Krishna devaraya ..</p>
<p>      Naickas in Tamilnadu (more of Telugu speaking rule).</p>
<p>      In 17th Century .. the British set their Foot ..</p>
<p>      In mid 20th Century we got freedom, but our priorities <br />    were "PAANCHA <br />      SHEEL " and SECULARISM !</p>
<p>      We have discussed enough on Secularism .. so gracefully coming <br />    out ..</p>
<p>      No Wonder our forefather did not know who built what ?</p>
<p>      Thanks to Sangam Literature, atleast Karikalan - <br />  Neduncheralathan -</p>
<p>      Nedunchezhians are remembered ..</p>
<p>      For our Forefather, Chozha means Karikalan .. !</p>
<p>      No doubt, we thank the British for decoding the script.. Then <br />  they <br />      were in Power .. helped by Venkayya and others .. <br />    Swamikkannupillai <br />      gave details on astronomical facts ..</p>
<p>      Archeological Survey of India was formed .. Books were <br />  published.''</p>
<p>      Vol I - South Indian inscriptions - Kancheepuram etc. - <br />  Pallavas / <br />      Pandias<br />      Vol II - Thanjavur Big Temple.</p>
<p>      Thanks to Wikipedia, these Volumes are now digitalised and avl <br />  in <br />      whatsindia.com, which is now widely quoted..</p>
<p>      Thanks to Neelakanta Sastry, he brought out TWO Great works on  <br />    The <br />      Cholas ..and South East Asian Provinces.</p>
<p>      Thanks to Raasamanickanar, his work on THE PALLAVAs is <br />  considered <br />      the best till this date.</p>
<p>      Thanks to Sadasiva Pandarathar - Pandiar Valararu and Chozhar <br />      varalaru.</p>
<p>      We have Epigraphica indica.<br />      We have inscriptions published by Tamilnadu State Archeology.. <br />  Dr. <br />      nagaswamy brought out Volumes on Thanjavur- Kanyakumari - <br />    Darmapuri <br />      Dts. Recently (2005 - 2006) Dr. TS Sridhar brought out <br />  exclusive <br />      volumes - related to about 10000 inscriptions in Thanjai belt <br />    alone.</p>
<p>      Dr. Kalaikkovan and Dr.Nalini have published books on Chozha <br />  Art - <br />      Dance etc., Their Varalaru issue is related to publication of <br />      inscriptions by Private sector.</p>
<p>      Dr. subbarayalu, Dr. Rasagopalan and their Tholliyal Kazhagam <br />  (of <br />      Tamil University, Thanjai) brings out Aavaanam annual issue <br />  (17 / <br />    18 <br />      released so far).</p>
<p>      What our dear Friends Venkat and Rahul query is whether this <br />are <br />    in <br />      concise form.</p>
<p>      The answer is NO.</p>
<p>      Do we have the Birth date of RRC. No.<br />      Prior to 985 AD : NO.<br />      Death :: No.</p>
<p>      These records are NOT available TO us.  <br />      ...... Does not mean they are not recorded. We have NOT FOUND.</p>
<p>      Because within 150 / 200 years of such records, we were Ruled <br />by <br />      Rulers of Different Culture ..</p>
<p>      And for us after freedom, the priorities were different.. </p>
<p>      Now we are able to breath around.. </p>
<p>      let us COMPILE what is Available first..</p>
<p>      Then look for fresh details...</p>
<p>      Let us assume some where the compiling work started.. We will <br />  know <br />      more sooner ..</p>
<p>      regards/ sps</p>
<p>      One more thing is there enough data on RRC to write a biography <br />  of <br />      300 pages?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The ancestry.com site is quite good and provision for lot of info to <br />build on.Have tried and put in the first cut under `chola family tree'-<br />just with the names. As sps sir said, we might need to do a lot more <br />work, before we can put it the years etc, but is a def start.</p>
<p>I also chanced on anoter file in net, which gives just the male <br />offsprings till <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , hv uploaded that file in the file section</p></acronym></p>

<p>Sure. We can keep all the details ready duly checked and counter-<br />checked. Then host in the web.</p>
<p>for instance, 969 - 971 was Sundara - Uthama co-rule. There are <br />different views on this.</p>

<p>    Why not we work this as a diary ( RRc has been blamed for not<br />    keeping a diary )...a page for every year and keep filling in the<br />    details etc. similar for rjc n others. we have a rough time line<br />    already handy. We could list the details and provide links to<br />    various documents/inscriptions/substantiations from his meikirti<br />    etc / pdf files/links in that file, so that it becomes a<br />    comprehensive guide on cholas. In essense do what the buddhist<br />  monks<br />    did in the mahavamsa...a chornicle of the cholas, chola vamsa<br />  diary<br />    kurippu..</p>

<p>found this link on Nagarathars while doing googling on free time.</p>

<p>The Meenatchi temple has a history of thousands of<br />years. It was built and rebuilt by kings and wealthy<br />people.</p>
<p>After the end of the Pandian dynasty, the Naickers and<br />then the Chettiars have contributed to this temple so<br />much.</p>
<p>AFAIK, there is no spell / curse on this unbuilt<br />tower. It was abandoned, probably because of a war or<br />a change in the dynasty / donar. </p>
<p>The unbuilt tower still stands there magnificiant,<br />witnessing the challenges. Today it is a shelter to<br />several retail stores there.</p>
<p>The present day Chettiar community can take up the<br />task of completing it! Some major towers in this<br />temple were built by Chettiars only... it is just a<br />continuity of the task of their ancestors... .</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi<br />  MOTTAI gopuram<br />  rahul or vk may be able to explain better being sons<br />  of the soil</p>
<p>  The Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswar Temple has 12<br />  gopurams in three <br />  corridors.but north mottai gopuram is a fully built<br />  gopuram without a <br />  roof.<br />  Built by Veerappa Naicker, grandson of Viswanatha<br />  Naicker in 1600 AD. <br />  Till recent years it was without a roof and<br />  therefore it was called <br />  mottai gopuram. During the end of the last century, <br />  the roof was <br />  provided in the 1880s by vaiynagaram nagappa<br />  chettiar family which <br />  did extensive thirupani there.'</p>
<p>  one of the inner gopurams is called chinna mottai.</p>
<p>  the unfinished gopuram at madurai is the Raya<br />  gopuram <br />  It lies to the east of Pudu mandapam. Measuring 200<br />  by 120 feet, it <br />  is nearly twice the size of the base of the East<br />  gopuram. If it had <br />  been completed, it would have been one of the<br />  biggest gopurams in <br />  South India, <br />  the structure owes its origin to Thirumalai<br />  Naicker. </p>
<p>  The monolithic pillars of Raya Gopuram are over 50<br />  feet high and mark <br />  the high degree of proficiency of the Dravidian<br />  stonemasons. Its <br />  pavilion pillars, lion-based pilasters and the<br />  carvings on the jambs <br />  display a keen sense of ornamentation. There are<br />  many reliefs <br />  (pudaippu sirpam) of Thirmalai Naicker and his<br />  queens and a figure of <br />  Meenakshi's coronation on the wall structure.</p>

<p>The book under review deals with an enduring legend about Talakad, <br />near Mysore... The Curse of Talakad: (Re)situating and (Re)<br />contextualizing a Legend in History, Sashi Sivaramakrishna, Rupa &amp; <br />Co, 2005, price not stated. </p>
<p>HISTORIANS like David Shulman caution us that legends and folklores <br />should not be discounted as sources of information for history. And <br />India abounds in such tales, which need to be interpreted. He points <br />out that there is a distinction between reports that are meant to be <br />factual and reports that are not considered factual. The book under <br />review deals with one such source, an enduring legend about Talakad, <br />near Mysore, known to historians as the headquarters of the Western <br />Ganga dynasty. </p>
<p>The name Talakad conjures up images of sand dunes and medieval <br />temples buried under the sand. In recent years, the site has been <br />popularised by filmmakers. The earliest reference to Talakad occurs <br />in an inscription of the Western Ganga monarch, Durvinita Kongini, <br />who ruled in the 6th Century A.D. Later, the records of the Chola <br />king Aditya I talk about Talakad being under Chola suzerainty. <br />Emperor Rajaraja continued to rule over this area. In 1116 A.D., the <br />Hoysala King, Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas and wrested control <br />of the area. The sway of the later-day Gangas extended over parts of <br />the present-day Tamil Nadu. The inscriptions in the Jain cave at <br />Vallimalai near Vellore speak of the Ganga kings. </p>
<p>The origins </p>
<p>The legend which surrounds this place is of much later origin. In <br />1610, Tirumala II of Srirangapattana, a vassal of Vijayanagara <br />empire, was overpowered by Raja Wodeyar of Mysore. Tirumala and his <br />wife Alamelamma retreated to Malingi, a village near Talakad, on the <br />banks of the Cauvery. She took with her the jewels she used to lend <br />to the temple priest twice a week, to adorn the goddess in that <br />temple. Wodeyar thought that the jewels belonged to the temple and <br />ordered its confiscation. Alamelamma would rather die than part with <br />the jewels. She collected the precious ornaments and drowned herself <br />in Cauvery, but not before uttering three curses: "Let Talakad <br />become sand. Let Malingi become a whirlpool. Let the Mysore king <br />fail to beget heirs." </p>
<p>Around Talakad, there are sand dunes covering an area of nearly ten <br />square kilometres. The river at Malingi is deep and treacherous and <br />the Mysore kings have not had male heirs for the past many <br />generations. </p>
<p>Sashi Sivaramakrishna, the author of this book, while making a <br />documentary film on the curse of Talakad, began examining the <br />historical and geological evidences to unravel the mystery of the <br />legend and the result is this interesting little book. The author <br />uses basically two sources to examine the Talakad legend. The first <br />is the travelogue of Dr. Francis Buchanan, a surgeon who was <br />appointed to carry out a survey for the East India company. He has <br />left a fascinating account of the area, including a vivid <br />description of Saravana Belgola. The second source is the Gazetteer <br />of Mysore district by B.L. Rice. </p>
<p>Of recent origin </p>
<p>The author arrives at the conclusion that the story of the curses <br />developed between Buchanan's travel, which was around 1800 and the <br />time Rice wrote his Gazetteer which is 1879. A crucial evidence he <br />points out is that of Gaurishankara temple, built in 1750. So it was <br />only much later that the temple was covered by sand. It has been <br />excavated by archaeologists recently. This would indicate that when <br />the temple was built, about three hundred years ago, there were no <br />sand dunes. So the story of the curse and the legend also must be of <br />recent origin. The conclusion is that the legend was constructed <br />long after Alamelamma died. However, about the third curse, of the <br />Mysore kings not having heirs, the author is unable to come to a <br />conclusion. </p>
<p>There is a useful bibliography, for those who want to pursue the <br />topic. The photographs are of poor quality, particularly the black <br />and white pictures. Nothing can be seen of the portrait sculpture of <br />Alamelamma or Tirumala II.</p>

<p>        The Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswar Temple has 12<br />        gopurams in three <br />        corridors.but north mottai gopuram is a fully<br />    built<br />        gopuram without a <br />        roof.<br />        Built by Veerappa Naicker, grandson of<br />    Viswanatha<br />        Naicker in 1600 AD. <br />        Till recent years it was without a roof and<br />        therefore it was called <br />        mottai gopuram. During the end of the last<br />    century, <br />        the roof was <br />        provided in the 1880s by vaiynagaram nagappa<br />        chettiar family which <br />        did extensive thirupani there.'</p>
<p>        one of the inner gopurams is called chinna<br />    mottai.</p>
<p>        the unfinished gopuram at madurai is the Raya<br />        gopuram <br />        It lies to the east of Pudu mandapam. Measuring<br />    200<br />        by 120 feet, it <br />        is nearly twice the size of the base of the East<br />        gopuram. If it had <br />        been completed, it would have been one of the<br />        biggest gopurams in <br />        South India, <br />        the structure owes its origin to Thirumalai<br />        Naicker. </p>
<p>        The monolithic pillars of Raya Gopuram are over<br />    50<br />        feet high and mark <br />        the high degree of proficiency of the Dravidian<br />        stonemasons. Its <br />        pavilion pillars, lion-based pilasters and the<br />        carvings on the jambs <br />        display a keen sense of ornamentation. There are<br />        many reliefs <br />        (pudaippu sirpam) of Thirmalai Naicker and his<br />        queens and a figure of <br />        Meenakshi's coronation on the wall structure.</p>

<p>          I guess that tower was completed in the 80's<br />    and<br />        Sri<br />          Lanka is never a peaceful nation since then...</p>

During the end of the last<br />  century, <br />      the roof was <br />      provided in the 1880s by vaiynagaram nagappa<br />      chettiar family which <br />      did extensive thirupani there.'</p>
<p>      one of the inner gopurams is called chinna<br />  mottai.</p>
<p>      the unfinished gopuram at madurai is the Raya<br />      gopuram <br />      It lies to the east of Pudu mandapam. Measuring<br />  200<br />      by 120 feet, it <br />      is nearly twice the size of the base of the East<br />      gopuram. If it had <br />      been completed, it would have been one of the<br />      biggest gopurams in <br />      South India, <br />      the structure owes its origin to Thirumalai<br />      Naicker. </p>
<p>      The monolithic pillars of Raya Gopuram are over<br />  50<br />      feet high and mark <br />      the high degree of proficiency of the Dravidian<br />      stonemasons. Its <br />      pavilion pillars, lion-based pilasters and the<br />      carvings on the jambs <br />      display a keen sense of ornamentation. There are<br />      many reliefs <br />      (pudaippu sirpam) of Thirmalai Naicker and his<br />      queens and a figure of <br />      Meenakshi's coronation on the wall structure.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>karumuthu kannan who is the head of the board of trustees of the <br />meenakshi temple is already doing a great job.<br />the covering of the entire shrine of nataraja with silver was done <br />under his leadership<br />lets hope this also comes to his notice.</p>
<p>kalahasthi, thiruvidaimaruthur, a part of ekambareshwarar, <br />thiruvadanai, thirukolakka were all rebuilt by one group of cousins.</p>
<p>another 120 temples were rebuilt by other nagarathar families.</p>
<p>the last of the major nagarathar kal thirupanis ended in the 1940s.<br />I dont think they did any major work after that.<br />now the major group involved is a group from coimbatore headed by <br />Mr.Vasanthakumar.</p>

        <p>Hi<br />MOTTAI gopuram<br />rahul or vk may be able to explain better being sons of the soil</p>
<p>The Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswar Temple has 12 gopurams in three <br />corridors.but north mottai gopuram is a fully built gopuram without a <br />roof.<br />Built by Veerappa Naicker, grandson of Viswanatha Naicker in 1600 AD. <br />Till recent years it was without a roof and therefore it was called <br />mottai gopuram. During the end of the last century, the roof was <br />provided in the 1880s by vaiynagaram nagappa chettiar family which <br />did extensive thirupani there.'</p>
<p>one of the inner gopurams is called chinna mottai.</p>
<p>the unfinished gopuram at madurai is the Raya gopuram <br />It lies to the east of Pudu mandapam. Measuring 200 by 120 feet, it <br />is nearly twice the size of the base of the East gopuram. If it had <br />been completed, it would have been one of the biggest gopurams in <br />South India, <br />the structure owes its origin to Thirumalai Naicker. </p>
<p>The monolithic pillars of Raya Gopuram are over 50 feet high and mark <br />the high degree of proficiency of the Dravidian stonemasons. Its <br />pavilion pillars, lion-based pilasters and the carvings on the jambs <br />display a keen sense of ornamentation. There are many reliefs <br />(pudaippu sirpam) of Thirmalai Naicker and his queens and a figure of <br />Meenakshi's coronation on the wall structure.</p>

<p>The book under review deals with an enduring legend about Talakad, <br />near Mysore... The Curse of Talakad: (Re)situating and (Re)<br />contextualizing a Legend in History, Sashi Sivaramakrishna, Rupa &amp; <br />Co, 2005, price not stated. </p>
<p>HISTORIANS like David Shulman caution us that legends and folklores <br />should not be discounted as sources of information for history. And <br />India abounds in such tales, which need to be interpreted. He points <br />out that there is a distinction between reports that are meant to be <br />factual and reports that are not considered factual. The book under <br />review deals with one such source, an enduring legend about Talakad, <br />near Mysore, known to historians as the headquarters of the Western <br />Ganga dynasty. </p>
<p>The name Talakad conjures up images of sand dunes and medieval <br />temples buried under the sand. In recent years, the site has been <br />popularised by filmmakers. The earliest reference to Talakad occurs <br />in an inscription of the Western Ganga monarch, Durvinita Kongini, <br />who ruled in the 6th Century A.D. Later, the records of the Chola <br />king Aditya I talk about Talakad being under Chola suzerainty. <br />Emperor Rajaraja continued to rule over this area. In 1116 A.D., the <br />Hoysala King, Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas and wrested control <br />of the area. The sway of the later-day Gangas extended over parts of <br />the present-day Tamil Nadu. The inscriptions in the Jain cave at <br />Vallimalai near Vellore speak of the Ganga kings. </p>
<p>The origins </p>
<p>The legend which surrounds this place is of much later origin. In <br />1610, Tirumala II of Srirangapattana, a vassal of Vijayanagara <br />empire, was overpowered by Raja Wodeyar of Mysore. Tirumala and his <br />wife Alamelamma retreated to Malingi, a village near Talakad, on the <br />banks of the Cauvery. She took with her the jewels she used to lend <br />to the temple priest twice a week, to adorn the goddess in that <br />temple. Wodeyar thought that the jewels belonged to the temple and <br />ordered its confiscation. Alamelamma would rather die than part with <br />the jewels. She collected the precious ornaments and drowned herself <br />in Cauvery, but not before uttering three curses: "Let Talakad <br />become sand. Let Malingi become a whirlpool. Let the Mysore king <br />fail to beget heirs." </p>
<p>Around Talakad, there are sand dunes covering an area of nearly ten <br />square kilometres. The river at Malingi is deep and treacherous and <br />the Mysore kings have not had male heirs for the past many <br />generations. </p>
<p>Sashi Sivaramakrishna, the author of this book, while making a <br />documentary film on the curse of Talakad, began examining the <br />historical and geological evidences to unravel the mystery of the <br />legend and the result is this interesting little book. The author <br />uses basically two sources to examine the Talakad legend. The first <br />is the travelogue of Dr. Francis Buchanan, a surgeon who was <br />appointed to carry out a survey for the East India company. He has <br />left a fascinating account of the area, including a vivid <br />description of Saravana Belgola. The second source is the Gazetteer <br />of Mysore district by B.L. Rice. </p>
<p>Of recent origin </p>
<p>The author arrives at the conclusion that the story of the curses <br />developed between Buchanan's travel, which was around 1800 and the <br />time Rice wrote his Gazetteer which is 1879. A crucial evidence he <br />points out is that of Gaurishankara temple, built in 1750. So it was <br />only much later that the temple was covered by sand. It has been <br />excavated by archaeologists recently. This would indicate that when <br />the temple was built, about three hundred years ago, there were no <br />sand dunes. So the story of the curse and the legend also must be of <br />recent origin. The conclusion is that the legend was constructed <br />long after Alamelamma died. However, about the third curse, of the <br />Mysore kings not having heirs, the author is unable to come to a <br />conclusion. </p>
<p>There is a useful bibliography, for those who want to pursue the <br />topic. The photographs are of poor quality, particularly the black <br />and white pictures. Nothing can be seen of the portrait sculpture of <br />Alamelamma or Tirumala II.</p>

        <p>LAST KINGS OF A DYNASTY</p>
<p>This was a subject discussed widely by Dr.Nalli Kuppusaami Chettiar when he attended my book releasing function at Vizag yesterday.</p>
<p>He said that his partner of Madurai Business, a Devaangu Chettiyaar happened to meet one Tiruchi SwamigaL at Bangalore some time back. The Swamiji, it seems told that partner that they had a 'KULA GURU' and one mutt but that was not operating for the past 170 years. And Swamiji offered one of his disciple as Guru and also told them to seek the permission from KRISHNADEVARAYA Vamsaadhipathi who are even now available at Hyderabad. The Partner went to Hyderabad and met those Raya based people. One such person of Krishna Deva Raya lineage is working at a Bank at Hyderabad.</p>
<p>I have sought some more details in clarity from Dr.Chettiyar and he promised to give me more on returning Chennai. It is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Chettiyar also asked me about any knowledge on Chola Vamsa Raja still anywhere living? I explained him about that <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group is on that course.</p>
<p>We can not predict the future. God knows, may be one fine day, one of our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  member may bring that man.</p>
<p>Another interesting news from Chettiyaar that he happened to meet some afgan like well built people in one of Governor's Tea-invite function. He enquired about them. They said that their elders belong to Samarkund in Afgan and during Aurangsib time, they had come marched here to Senji with an army to capture the fort. But the Senji Nawab, I think a clever man, by offering lot of wealth, kept them outside the fort for seven long years. These people also were sending Aurangasib some messages with some stories that they are on their job but with lot of restrictions. Finally these army stayed here itself. </p>
<p>Well, Chettiyaar has lot of interest in history and eager to know the actual happenings.</p>

        <p>Eventhough the samprokshanam for the rajagopuram was done in March 1987,<br />it took more than 8 years to build.

        <p>Actually the construction was started in 1983. Eventhough the ethnic problem in started in the 70's, the bloody riots in 1983 started the full fledged armed militancy there. Prabhakaran was a second rung leader then, but with assasination of the top leadership of LTTE like Kuttymani, he came into prominence in 1983.</p>

<p>  The name Talakad conjures up images of sand dunes<br />  and medieval <br />  temples buried under the sand. In recent years, the<br />  site has been <br />  popularised by filmmakers. The earliest reference to<br />  Talakad occurs <br />  in an inscription of the Western Ganga monarch,<br />  Durvinita Kongini, <br />  who ruled in the 6th Century A.D. Later, the records<br />  of the Chola <br />  king Aditya I talk about Talakad being under Chola<br />  suzerainty. <br />  Emperor Rajaraja continued to rule over this area.<br />  In 1116 A.D., the <br />  Hoysala King, Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas and<br />  wrested control <br />  of the area. The sway of the later-day Gangas<br />  extended over parts of <br />  the present-day Tamil Nadu. The inscriptions in the<br />  Jain cave at <br />  Vallimalai near Vellore speak of the Ganga kings. </p>
<p>  The origins </p>
<p>  The legend which surrounds this place is of much<br />  later origin. In <br />  1610, Tirumala II of Srirangapattana, a vassal of<br />  Vijayanagara <br />  empire, was overpowered by Raja Wodeyar of Mysore.<br />  Tirumala and his <br />  wife Alamelamma retreated to Malingi, a village near<br />  Talakad, on the <br />  banks of the Cauvery. She took with her the jewels<br />  she used to lend <br />  to the temple priest twice a week, to adorn the<br />  goddess in that <br />  temple. Wodeyar thought that the jewels belonged to<br />  the temple and <br />  ordered its confiscation. Alamelamma would rather<br />  die than part with <br />  the jewels. She collected the precious ornaments and<br />  drowned herself <br />  in Cauvery, but not before uttering three curses:<br />  "Let Talakad <br />  become sand. Let Malingi become a whirlpool. Let the<br />  Mysore king <br />  fail to beget heirs." </p>
<p>  Around Talakad, there are sand dunes covering an<br />  area of nearly ten <br />  square kilometres. The river at Malingi is deep and<br />  treacherous and <br />  the Mysore kings have not had male heirs for the<br />  past many <br />  generations. </p>
<p>  Sashi Sivaramakrishna, the author of this book,<br />  while making a <br />  documentary film on the curse of Talakad, began<br />  examining the <br />  historical and geological evidences to unravel the<br />  mystery of the <br />  legend and the result is this interesting little<br />  book. The author <br />  uses basically two sources to examine the Talakad<br />  legend. The first <br />  is the travelogue of Dr. Francis Buchanan, a surgeon<br />  who was <br />  appointed to carry out a survey for the East India<br />  company. He has <br />  left a fascinating account of the area, including a<br />  vivid <br />  description of Saravana Belgola. The second source<br />  is the Gazetteer <br />  of Mysore district by B.L. Rice. </p>
<p>  Of recent origin </p>
<p>  The author arrives at the conclusion that the story<br />  of the curses <br />  developed between Buchanan's travel, which was<br />  around 1800 and the <br />  time Rice wrote his Gazetteer which is 1879. A<br />  crucial evidence he <br />  points out is that of Gaurishankara temple, built in<br />  1750. So it was <br />  only much later that the temple was covered by sand.<br />  It has been <br />  excavated by archaeologists recently. This would<br />  indicate that when <br />  the temple was built, about three hundred years ago,<br />  there were no <br />  sand dunes. So the story of the curse and the legend<br />  also must be of <br />  recent origin. The conclusion is that the legend was<br />  constructed <br />  long after Alamelamma died. However, about the third<br />  curse, of the <br />  Mysore kings not having heirs, the author is unable<br />  to come to a <br />  conclusion. </p>
<p>  There is a useful bibliography, for those who want<br />  to pursue the <br />  topic. The photographs are of poor quality,<br />  particularly the black <br />  and white pictures. Nothing can be seen of the<br />  portrait sculpture of <br />  Alamelamma or Tirumala II.</p>

        <p>I don't believe in this.</p>
<p>If my memory is right the Srirangam Gopuram was constructed sometime in<br />1987. But the atrocities started as early as 70s.</p>
<p>We do have family friends who left their home / property worth lakhs in<br />those days / business and settled in Tamil Nadu. Actually I should say they<br />were driven out of Sri Lanka. This happened in 1980 -1981.</p>
<p>So I don't see any correlation between building the tower and downfall of a<br />kingdom / country.</p>

<p>    The book under review deals with an enduring legend<br />    about Talakad,<br />    near Mysore... The Curse of Talakad: (Re)situating<br />    and (Re)<br />    contextualizing a Legend in History, Sashi<br />    Sivaramakrishna, Rupa &amp;     Co, 2005, price not stated.</p>
<p>    HISTORIANS like David Shulman caution us that<br />    legends and folklores<br />    should not be discounted as sources of information<br />    for history. And<br />    India abounds in such tales, which need to be<br />    interpreted. He points<br />    out that there is a distinction between reports that<br />    are meant to be<br />    factual and reports that are not considered factual.<br />    The book under<br />    review deals with one such source, an enduring<br />    legend about Talakad,<br />    near Mysore, known to historians as the headquarters<br />    of the Western<br />    Ganga dynasty.</p>
<p>    The name Talakad conjures up images of sand dunes<br />    and medieval<br />    temples buried under the sand. In recent years, the<br />    site has been<br />    popularised by filmmakers. The earliest reference to<br />    Talakad occurs<br />    in an inscription of the Western Ganga monarch,<br />    Durvinita Kongini,<br />    who ruled in the 6th Century A.D. Later, the records<br />    of the Chola<br />    king Aditya I talk about Talakad being under Chola<br />    suzerainty.<br />    Emperor Rajaraja continued to rule over this area.<br />    In 1116 A.D., the<br />    Hoysala King, Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas and<br />    wrested control<br />    of the area. The sway of the later-day Gangas<br />    extended over parts of<br />    the present-day Tamil Nadu. The inscriptions in the<br />    Jain cave at<br />    Vallimalai near Vellore speak of the Ganga kings.</p>
<p>    The origins</p>
<p>    The legend which surrounds this place is of much<br />    later origin. In<br />    1610, Tirumala II of Srirangapattana, a vassal of<br />    Vijayanagara<br />    empire, was overpowered by Raja Wodeyar of Mysore.<br />    Tirumala and his<br />    wife Alamelamma retreated to Malingi, a village near<br />    Talakad, on the<br />    banks of the Cauvery. She took with her the jewels<br />    she used to lend<br />    to the temple priest twice a week, to adorn the<br />    goddess in that<br />    temple. Wodeyar thought that the jewels belonged to<br />    the temple and<br />    ordered its confiscation. Alamelamma would rather<br />    die than part with<br />    the jewels. She collected the precious ornaments and<br />    drowned herself<br />    in Cauvery, but not before uttering three curses:<br />    "Let Talakad<br />    become sand. Let Malingi become a whirlpool. Let the<br />    Mysore king<br />    fail to beget heirs."</p>
<p>    Around Talakad, there are sand dunes covering an<br />    area of nearly ten<br />    square kilometres. The river at Malingi is deep and<br />    treacherous and<br />    the Mysore kings have not had male heirs for the<br />    past many<br />    generations.</p>
<p>    Sashi Sivaramakrishna, the author of this book,<br />    while making a<br />    documentary film on the curse of Talakad, began<br />    examining the<br />    historical and geological evidences to unravel the<br />    mystery of the<br />    legend and the result is this interesting little<br />    book. The author<br />    uses basically two sources to examine the Talakad<br />    legend. The first<br />    is the travelogue of Dr. Francis Buchanan, a surgeon<br />    who was<br />    appointed to carry out a survey for the East India<br />    company. He has<br />    left a fascinating account of the area, including a<br />    vivid<br />    description of Saravana Belgola. The second source<br />    is the Gazetteer<br />    of Mysore district by B.L. Rice.</p>
<p>    Of recent origin</p>
<p>    The author arrives at the conclusion that the story<br />    of the curses<br />    developed between Buchanan's travel, which was<br />    around 1800 and the<br />    time Rice wrote his Gazetteer which is 1879. A<br />    crucial evidence he<br />    points out is that of Gaurishankara temple, built in<br />    1750. So it was<br />    only much later that the temple was covered by sand.<br />    It has been<br />    excavated by archaeologists recently. This would<br />    indicate that when<br />    the temple was built, about three hundred years ago,<br />    there were no<br />    sand dunes. So the story of the curse and the legend<br />    also must be of<br />    recent origin. The conclusion is that the legend was<br />    constructed<br />    long after Alamelamma died. However, about the third<br />    curse, of the<br />    Mysore kings not having heirs, the author is unable<br />    to come to a<br />    conclusion.</p>
<p>    There is a useful bibliography, for those who want<br />    to pursue the<br />    topic. The photographs are of poor quality,<br />    particularly the black<br />    and white pictures. Nothing can be seen of the<br />    portrait sculpture of<br />    Alamelamma or Tirumala II.</p>

<p>  The book under review deals with an enduring legend about Talakad, <br />  near Mysore... The Curse of Talakad: (Re)situating and (Re)<br />  contextualizing a Legend in History, Sashi Sivaramakrishna, Rupa &amp; <br />  Co, 2005, price not stated.  </p>
<p>  HISTORIANS like David Shulman caution us that legends and folklores <br />  should not be discounted as sources of information for history. And <br />  India abounds in such tales, which need to be interpreted. He <br />points <br />  out that there is a distinction between reports that are meant to <br />be <br />  factual and reports that are not considered factual. The book under <br />  review deals with one such source, an enduring legend about <br />Talakad, <br />  near Mysore, known to historians as the headquarters of the Western <br />  Ganga dynasty. </p>
<p>  The name Talakad conjures up images of sand dunes and medieval <br />  temples buried under the sand. In recent years, the site has been <br />  popularised by filmmakers. The earliest reference to Talakad occurs <br />  in an inscription of the Western Ganga monarch, Durvinita Kongini, <br />  who ruled in the 6th Century A.D. Later, the records of the Chola <br />  king Aditya I talk about Talakad being under Chola suzerainty. <br />  Emperor Rajaraja continued to rule over this area. In 1116 A.D., <br />the <br />  Hoysala King, Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas and wrested <br />control <br />  of the area. The sway of the later-day Gangas extended over parts <br />of <br />  the present-day Tamil Nadu. The inscriptions in the Jain cave at <br />  Vallimalai near Vellore speak of the Ganga kings. </p>
<p>  The origins </p>
<p>  The legend which surrounds this place is of much later origin. In <br />  1610, Tirumala II of Srirangapattana, a vassal of Vijayanagara <br />  empire, was overpowered by Raja Wodeyar of Mysore. Tirumala and his <br />  wife Alamelamma retreated to Malingi, a village near Talakad, on <br />the <br />  banks of the Cauvery. She took with her the jewels she used to lend <br />  to the temple priest twice a week, to adorn the goddess in that <br />  temple. Wodeyar thought that the jewels belonged to the temple and <br />  ordered its confiscation. Alamelamma would rather die than part <br />with <br />  the jewels. She collected the precious ornaments and drowned <br />herself <br />  in Cauvery, but not before uttering three curses: "Let Talakad <br />  become sand. Let Malingi become a whirlpool. Let the Mysore king <br />  fail to beget heirs." </p>
<p>  Around Talakad, there are sand dunes covering an area of nearly ten <br />  square kilometres. The river at Malingi is deep and treacherous and <br />  the Mysore kings have not had male heirs for the past many <br />  generations. </p>
<p>  Sashi Sivaramakrishna, the author of this book, while making a <br />  documentary film on the curse of Talakad, began examining the <br />  historical and geological evidences to unravel the mystery of the <br />  legend and the result is this interesting little book. The author <br />  uses basically two sources to examine the Talakad legend. The first <br />  is the travelogue of Dr. Francis Buchanan, a surgeon who was <br />  appointed to carry out a survey for the East India company. He has <br />  left a fascinating account of the area, including a vivid <br />  description of Saravana Belgola. The second source is the Gazetteer <br />  of Mysore district by B.L. Rice. </p>
<p>  Of recent origin </p>
<p>  The author arrives at the conclusion that the story of the curses <br />  developed between Buchanan's travel, which was around 1800 and the <br />  time Rice wrote his Gazetteer which is 1879. A crucial evidence he <br />  points out is that of Gaurishankara temple, built in 1750. So it <br />was <br />  only much later that the temple was covered by sand. It has been <br />  excavated by archaeologists recently. This would indicate that when <br />  the temple was built, about three hundred years ago, there were no <br />  sand dunes. So the story of the curse and the legend also must be <br />of <br />  recent origin. The conclusion is that the legend was constructed <br />  long after Alamelamma died. However, about the third curse, of the <br />  Mysore kings not having heirs, the author is unable to come to a <br />  conclusion. </p>
<p>  There is a useful bibliography, for those who want to pursue the <br />  topic. The photographs are of poor quality, particularly the black <br />  and white pictures. Nothing can be seen of the portrait sculpture <br />of <br />  Alamelamma or Tirumala II.</p>

<p>hi venkat</p>
<p>reminded of what is said about the prophecy related to sher e <br />punjab, maharaja ranjit singh ( who donated the gold for the golden <br />temple)..</p>
<p>The tenth Guru of Sikhism had ordered his Sikhs not to build any <br />monument on the place where he Sikh ascended into heaven. ( Nanded, <br />Maharashtra). Anyone who did built any monument on this place, would <br />make his living male progeny and blood lineage die and <br />extinct.Ranjit singh defied this and built a temple, Takht Sri Hazur <br />Sahib. It was completed in 1839 and that same year Maharajah Ranjit <br />Singh died. All of his sons, except Dalip Singh, died within 5 years <br />of his death and the temple's completion. His only remaining infant <br />son Maharajah Dulip Singh was made kingdom less as a child by the <br />British, within 10 years of Maharajah Ranjit Singh's death. He died <br />penniless, in a hotel room in Paris</p>
<p>also check this interesting post on the treasure of ranjit singh in <br />a swiss bank vault</p>

<p>History of the Andhras<br />upto 1565 A. D.</p>
<p>Beautiful work..excellant account of the chola/chalukya wars and the <br />later day chola chalukya</p>
<p>as you read these, you are reminded of vengaiyin mainthan..</p>
<p>In the reign of Rajarajanarendra (1018-22-61 A.D.) the<br />Chalukya-Chola rivalry in Vengi reached a high pitch. His<br />accession to the throne was challenged by his step brother,<br />Vjjayaditya (VII) who usurped the throne with the help of<br />Jayasimha II, king of Kalyani. But his maternal uncle and the<br />Chola emperor, Rajendra Chola, came to his rescue and after<br />defeating the usurper and his Western Chalukya ally, reinstated<br />Rajarajsnarendra in Vengi in 1022 A.D. and gave him his<br />daughter Ammangadevi in marriage.</p>
<p>On the Eastern Chalukyan front,<br />the Chola army ted by the general Soliyavarasan defeated<br />Vijayaditya and his Kalinga and Odda supporters in several<br />battles, took possession of the country on behalf of Rajaraja<br />Narendra and proceeded afterwards on a grand military expedition<br />to the Gangetic valley. To protect the rear of his army<br />campaigning in the Gangetic valley, Rajendra Chola I had his<br />sojourn on the banks of the Godavari, during which he enthroned<br />his nephew Rajaraja Narendra as the ruler of Vengi<br />and celebrated the latter's coronation on 16th August 1022 A.D.<br />He even gave his daughter Ammangai in marriage to his nephew<br />who had by her a son Rajendra named after him.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>at this juncture Rajaraja thought that it was in the<br />best interests of the Cholas to see that the Eastern Chalukyas<br />did not make common cause with their cousins in the west,<br />for such a coalition would constitute a challenge to the rising<br />Chola power. He decided befriend the weaker as against the<br />The Eastern Chalukyas 103<br />stronger and create the traditional sphere of balance of power<br />in South India. He took advantage of the situation when the<br />sons of the Eastern Chalukya Danamava, being deprived of<br />their parental kingdom by Jata Choda Bhima, sought his help.<br />He espoused their cause and entered into matrimonial alliance<br />with them. He gave his daughter Kundavai in marriage to<br />Vimaladitya, the younger of the two princes and his was but<br />a beginning of series of diplomatic marriages between these<br />two dynasties. He invaded coastal Telugu country twice and<br />in the second attempt in 1002-03 A.D., having slain Jata Choda<br />Bhima in battle succeeded in establishing Darramava's elder<br />son Saktivarma I firmly on the Vengi throne.</p>
<blockquote><p>some more excerpts</p></blockquote>
<p>THE CHALUKYA-CHOLA CONFLICT IN VENGI<br />Bhima invaded Kanchi region in 1001 A.D. This was probably<br />in pursuance of the ambitious and imperialistic Chola<br />army of Rajaraja I who espoused the cause of Danamava's sons,<br />and having given his daughter in marriage to the younger of<br />the two princes (Vimaladitya), invaded Vengi in 999-1000 A.D.<br />to restore them to their ancestral throne. Bhima laid seize to<br />Kanchi and captured it in 1001-2 A.D. But soon he was<br />expelled from the Chola territory. Rajaraja I then invaded the<br />coastal Telugu country again and having slain Bhima in battle<br />established Saktivarma I, the elder son of Danamava, firmly<br />in Vengi. However Vengi ceased to be an independent kingdom<br />and became a protectorate of the Chola empire.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But Chola<br />Rajendra II killed Saktivarma and raised Rajarajanarendra's son,<br />Rajendra to the throne and gave his daughter Madhurantaki in<br />marriage to him.<br />On the death of Virarajendra and the assassination of his<br />son and successor Adhirajendra a few months later in 1070 A.D.<br />in Tanjore, the Eastern Chalukya Rajendra, a descendant through<br />his mother from Rajendra Chola I, went to Tanjore and ascended<br />the Chola throne as Kulottunga I,</p>
