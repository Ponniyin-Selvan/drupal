</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi Folks,<br />There are some short stories of Kalki which are a tad<br />boring. However, we must acknowledge the fact that he<br />had a great gift of describing events in detail. Since<br />we live many years away from the past, it is only but<br />natural to get facinated by the way of life, stories<br />and events of several centuries ago. The spirt of<br />nationalism he tried to evoke with <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  in those years<br />is commendable. <br />Good author when he had to write about past events.<br />Great imagination. Sometimes unable to lace multiple<br />events with no loopholes :)<br />Best Wishes,<br />Deepa</acronym></p>
<p>--- "R.venketesh" <abhivencat@yahoo.com  wrote:</p></abhivencat@yahoo.com></p>
<blockquote>
<p>    Dear SPS<br />    In my opinion after having read the Kalki's many<br />  writtings, he <br />  must have been a multi talented personality. i see<br />  in him a <br />  naturalist, painter, historian, anthropologist,<br />  archaeologist,<br />  novolist,meteorologist,cilmatologist . still too may<br />  to mention.</p>
<p>  Hi <br />  isnt this glorification a little too much.<br />  Kalki was a great observer who could recall several<br />  of his <br />  observations in to his books.</p>
<p>  he was no expert in meterology just because he<br />  described a thunder <br />  storm.<br />  his history tells us he was an expert as a writer<br />  and music critic.</p>
<p>  I sincerely hope we can discuss kalki's pitfalls as<br />  well as his <br />  proficiencies.<br />  and for those who havent read the other works of<br />  kalki , please do <br />  and you will get a complete picture of the author.<br />  regards<br />  venketesh</p></blockquote>

<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  was penned during a period when pride and self esteem of Tamizh<br />population was at its lowest and honour consisted of identification <br />with the British Regime (this phrase was coined by somebody in <br />Orkut, i loved it) This is true even today when most of our grand <br />parents take pride in that they served the Britisher.</acronym></p>
<p>Kalki actually showed us that we had a lot to be proud of<br />(Mr.Venketesh is so true) by bringing the Tamizh history and culture<br />into focus. I have heard that it was he who bought Bharatanatyam to <br />the common man. Maybe some in our group could shed light on this.</p>

<p>okay agreed. but what sense of nationalism could such a book have<br />given in times of an independence struggle? ( or for the matter in a<br />freshly independent country)</p>
<p>did it not enforce what the british were telling us all along. that<br />india was full of warring tribes which they and they only united and<br />if they left everything would go back to chaos.</p>
<p>the individual nationalism is still alive even in this group.try<br />talking to rahul dhinakaran about chola superiority and expecta mile<br />long mail denying it.</p>
<p>whaty kalki was trying to tell his readers was that " we were not<br />always slaves. we were conquerors at one time. and those before us<br />were brave in battle. not docile like us.</p>

<p>I think Nationalism has to be seen in the context of the time that<br />the story is set in. Nationalism in our current time means the <br />geopgraphical entity of India. In the Chola/Chera/Pandya/Pallava <br />times, nationalism meant a love for the respective kingdoms. In <br />that sense VanthiyathevAn etc were Chola nationalists while even <br />Ravidasan and co were Pandya nationalists.</p>

<p>You may not be able to find nationalism in his<br />historic writing may be, but his attachment to<br />Rajaji and Gandhi is well known and can be seen in<br />many of his non-fiction works.<br />regards,<br />siva.</p>

<p>you seem to know a lot about kalki for someone not<br />familiar with the tamil script</p>
<p>I am also reading kalki's short stories atleast one<br />or two a week.<br />I am able to see a common thread but what fascinated me was his<br />obsession for life after death.<br />for a descriptive man like kalki such situations<br />are like halwa.he comes out in flying colours in such stories where<br />he uses last life memories.</p>
<p>his best was solaimalai ilavarasi where he spins a<br />tale of a freedom fighter on the run after destroying a railway<br />track. he hides in a dilapitated fort and is helped by a local girl <br />who father is a staunch british supporter.<br />he dreams of his past life in the same fort. the girl is there too in<br />the past life.<br />a very great portrayal of freedom fighting in 2<br />eras. pre congress and<br />post congress.<br />that if you ask me is kalki's materpiece in<br />nationalism.<br />but frankly speaking kalki always talks about<br />infighting with tamils or indians in his historic books. I dont <br />think there was much nationalism involved in his historic books <br />though they were deeply recorded in his alai osai and thyga bhomi.</p>
<p>what he talked about was the victory of one indian<br />clan over another. highly localised nationalism in fact. <br />glad if you could point some<br />instances of nationalism in his historic books.</p>

<p>Hi Folks,<br />There are some short stories of Kalki which are a<br />tad boring. However, we must acknowledge the fact<br />that hehad a great gift of describing events in detail. Since<br />we live many years away from the past, it is only<br />but natural to get facinated by the way of life,<br />stories and events of several centuries ago. The spirt of<br />nationalism he tried to evoke with <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  in those<br />years is commendable. Good author when he had to write about past<br />events.<br />Great imagination. Sometimes unable to lace<br />multiple events with no loopholes :)<br />Best Wishes,<br />Deepa<br />--- "R.venketesh" <abhivencat@  wrote:<br />Dear SPS<br />In my opinion after having read the Kalki's<br />many writings, he must have been a multi talented personality. i<br />seein him a naturalist, painter, historian, anthropologist,<br />archaeologist, novolist,meteorologist,cilmatologist . still<br />too may to mention.</abhivencat@></acronym></p>
<p>Hi<br />isnt this glorification a little too much.<br />Kalki was a great observer who could recall<br />several of his observations in to his books.<br />he was no expert in meterology just because he<br />described a thunder storm.<br />his history tells us he was an expert as a<br />writer and music critic.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope we can discuss kalki's<br />pitfalls as well as his proficiencies.<br />and for those who havent read the other works<br />of kalki , please do<br />and you will get a complete picture of the<br />author.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Diwakar<br />Thanks for the details</p>
<p>so Kopperunjinkan, was a descendant of one of the nayanmars.</p>
<p>a very interesting personality indeed . multi faceted.</p>
<p>How like two sides of the scales one dynasty goes down and another <br />comes up?</p>
<p>regards<br />venketesh</p>
<p>son of Azhakiya Pallava Sadumperumal, must be considered as very <br />important among the major causes for the decline of the later Cholas.<br />. He was a Kadava and the Kadavas of the 13th century were the <br />descendants of the Pallavas. Kaduvetti was a variant of Kadava and <br />stood for Pallava. We hear of Tondaimans and Kadavas from the <br />beginning of Imperial Chola power indicating that the fall of <br />Aparajita did not mean the extinction of the Pallava.  </p>
<blockquote><p>  With Kulottunga III who was no doubt a competent ruler, the <br />decline in Chola fortunes marked by the rise of unruly subordinates </p></blockquote>
<p>becomes obvious. In the reign of Rajaraja III (Son of K-III) the <br />Kadavas of Tondaimandalam under the leadership of Kopperunjinga <br />assumed enough independence and power not only to question Imperial <br />Chola authority but give battle to the Chola and even defeat and <br />subordinate chief's for treason had become common and frequent. The <br />chief's in their turn formed compacts by which they solemnly bound <br />themselves to a code of behaviour which could be and usually was <br />directed against the sovereign. Thus was inaugurated an age of treason <br />and open defiance of imperial authority. There were numeroud <br />inscriptions in the time of Raja Raja III speaks of treasons and <br />punishment (Rajadhrokam).</p>
<blockquote><p>  Of those who succeeded in this most, the ambitious Kopperunjinga <br />was the most illustrious for his activities were not confined to </p></blockquote>
<p>rebellion and treason. In his own right he was a good ruler and a <br />great patron of art. He started as a loyal feudatory of the Cholas. <br />But in 1231 at Tellaru (near Wandiwash) he defeated the emperor <br />Rajaraja III and imprisoned him at Sendamangalam. Vira Narasimha II <br />Hoysala intervened on behalf of the Cholas, defeated Kopperunjinga and <br />restored Rajaraja to the Chola throne. For a time Kopperunjinga became <br />loyal to the Chola. But in 1243 he again assumed independent status. <br />He avenged his defeat at the hands of the Hoysalas by defeating them <br />at Perambur. Trichy district in 1252/53. The meteoric career of <br />Kopperunjinga was however rudely reduced to vassalage by Jatavarman <br />Sundara, the all ? conquering Pandya. Kopperunjinga's activities were <br />spread over the Tondaimandalam mainly. He built the eastern tower of <br />Chidambaram temple. He assumed high</p>
<blockquote><p>  sounding titles like 'Kavisarvabhauma' (Kavichakravarthi) which <br />means ` emperor among poets'. This could have been an exaggeration but </p></blockquote>
<p>his general abilities in government and warfare are beyond question. <br />This very in subordinate is an excellent illustration of the kind of <br />chieftains declining kingdoms will throw up. Not only incriptions, <br />even one classical work 'Gadhyakarnamrutha' lights some of the <br />acheivements of this king's numerous endowments and reconstruction of <br />temple works which earned him a name in the cultural history of Tamil <br />Nadu. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Ku. Balasubramaniam's Koyirkalai book says (referring various <br />Historians) Kopperunjikan was invloved in the construction of three </p></blockquote>
<p>Rajagopuram of Thillai.</p>
<blockquote><p>  SENDAMANGALAM: Kopperunjinkan must have erred here that he <br />captured the last emperor of Chola Raja Raja III, when the king was </p></blockquote>
<p>escaping to Hoysala country after failing with Pandya. <br />'Gadyakarnamrutha' say that the King was overtaken surprisely by <br />Kopperunjinkan and thrown into the prison at Sendamangalam. But <br />Hoysala came to the rescue of Chola with the vengence and ransacked <br />Sendamangalam and released Chola and he was restored to Chola throne <br />too. For this, the army of Hoysala stayed back permenantly in the <br />Chola country to keep peace for some time and subdued the <br />irrespressable Kopperunjinkan too.</p>
<blockquote><p>  But whatever Hostory talked about Kopperunjinkan and his <br />treasonable activities for the fall of chola empire, Raja Raja III has </p></blockquote>
<p>also got a name in the history as an imcompetent Chola King.</p>

<p>am not sure, if the Hoysalas overram him, I am not sure if it was <br />someshwara who did that.. Infact Hoysalas themselves overthrew the <br />chalukyas(they themselves were overlords for chalukyas) Historically <br />we are seeing the emergence of overlords.. Cholas were infact <br />alternating between Pallavas and Pandyas and counting their time.</p>

<p>and finally the muslim conquest, whoaa.. did english were overlords <br />for any of the indian kings?</p>

<p>  -Hi Diwakar</p>
<p>  could you enlighten us on</p>
<p>  kadavas<br />  sendanmangalam incident<br />  Kopperunginkan</p>
<p>  seems to be the beginning of the end for the cholas.</p>
<p>  read somewhere that Kopperunginkan descended from the sambuvarayar <br />  clan and he was related by marriage to the cholas.</p>

<p>    this charecter seems to be a fascinating one,</p>
<p>    he was pious built the south gopuram of chidambaram.</p>
<p>    was a feudatory of the chola king and at one point rebelled held <br />the <br />    entire chola court hostage and took titles for it. the hoysals had <br />  to <br />    come and bail out the chola king.</p>
<p>    tells us how pazhuvur and kodumbalur were the pillars of RRc.</p>
<p>    the same thing happend with later pandyas. no feudatories. the <br />ever <br />    hungry pandya war machine had gobbled up everybody and when malik <br />    kafur came there was nobody to even slow him down.</p>

        <p>Dear Venkatesh</p>
<p>In Periya Puranam Sekkizhar when mentioning about Appar Piran and His conversion into saivism, narrated how 'Kadava King' rushed to seek the pardon of Appar Piran. Kadava, the word may be started used from 6th century onwards for Pallavas. Ayyadigal Kadavarkon, a nayanmar related to Pallava Simhavarman (Mahendra's grandfather) was a King turned 'Sivanadiyaar' who sang 'Kshetra Thiruvenbaa' which was included in ThirumuRai. I have read these small sects of songs. Just beutiful and telling us about the glorious temples of Chola country.In later chola inscriptions the pallava sub-ordinates being called as Kadavarayas</p>
<p>Azhakiya Siyan Kopperunjinkan, son of Azhakiya Pallava Sadumperumal, must be considered as very important among the major causes for the decline of the later Cholas. . He was a Kadava and the Kadavas of the 13th century were the descendants of the Pallavas. Kaduvetti was a variant of Kadava and stood for Pallava. We hear of Tondaimans and Kadavas from the beginning of Imperial Chola power indicating that the fall of Aparajita did not mean the extinction of the Pallava. </p>
<p>Of those who succeeded in this most, the ambitious Kopperunjinga was the most illustrious for his activities were not confined to rebellion and treason. In his own right he was a good ruler and a great patron of art. He started as a loyal feudatory of the Cholas. But in 1231 at Tellaru (near Wandiwash) he defeated the emperor Rajaraja III and imprisoned him at Sendamangalam. Vira Narasimha II Hoysala intervened on behalf of the Cholas, defeated Kopperunjinga and restored Rajaraja to the Chola throne. For a time Kopperunjinga became loyal to the Chola. But in 1243 he again assumed independent status. He avenged his defeat at the hands of the Hoysalas by defeating them at Perambur. Trichy district in 1252/53.

He assumed high<br />sounding titles like 'Kavisarvabhauma' (Kavichakravarthi) which means &#145; emperor among poets&#146;. This could have been an exaggeration but his general abilities in government and warfare are beyond question. This very in subordinate is an excellent illustration of the kind of chieftains declining kingdoms will throw up. Not only incriptions, even one classical work 'Gadhyakarnamrutha' lights some of the acheivements of this king's numerous endowments and reconstruction of temple works which earned him a name in the cultural history of Tamil Nadu. <br />Ku. Balasubramaniam's Koyirkalai book says (referring various Historians) Kopperunjikan was invloved in the construction of three Rajagopuram of Thillai.</p>
<p>SENDAMANGALAM: Kopperunjinkan must have erred here that he captured the last emperor of Chola Raja Raja III, when the king was escaping to Hoysala country after failing with Pandya. 'Gadyakarnamrutha' say that the King was overtaken surprisely by Kopperunjinkan and thrown into the prison at Sendamangalam.

        <p>tells us how pazhuvur and kodumbalur were the pillars of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .-----<br />-----------------------------------------<br />&lt; Yes. Even during Koppam war against Chalukyas during Rajathi Raja's time, (Rajendra' son) when the King was killed in the war, the sambuvaraiyars and Malaiyamans played a very great role in in-stalling an Emperor (Rajendra-2) in the war-field itself . The Chieftians stick to the policy of central Rule even during crisis. It was due to Rajaraja's policy only.</acronym></p>
<p>I remember Kargil war and Indo-pak/bangla war. All states of India with different CMs united as one against a common enemy. This was seen during Chola period. </p>
<p>But it was not there during later cholas. Again example - Kopperunginken. When a local chieftian like him capture a chola emperor and his court, an outsider (those days) like hoysala has to come and rescue. What has happened to other local chieftians?</p>

        <p>Dear Venkatesh and SPS,<br />Very good start on later Cholas. <br />1. Individual worship, not national pride, may be main reason for falling of Cholas. The integration between small states and centre created by the great Raja Raja was completely destroyed during the period of later cholas. </p>
<p>2. No major wars between Cholas and their erstwhile enemies after Kulottungan period. Even Chalukya Vikramathitya VI, the dangerous enemy of Cholas too kept quite after AD 1000. Sinhala has gone to Sinhalas during Kulottungan time itself. Not much was in Srilanka afterwards between Tamils and Lankans. So, war culture was limited during later cholas time. And in-fighting started between main chieftians - example Kopperunginkan who built THILLAI Gopurams.</p>
<p>3. Because there was no major wars and peace prevailed we have got more classical works in Tamil during their time (one great asset to Tamils). </p>
<p>4. Rajaraja &amp; Rajendra behaved like humble persons and not like dictators. But it was not there during later chola time. The later Cholas behaved like more than Dictators (Ref. Kalingattu Parani - Kulottunga put his leg on the head of friendly country chieftian - and one of the last chola put his leg on head of Pandya King at Madurai Palace. Any such dictatorship can not last long.</p>
<p>But If Raja Raja's Policy of central governance with democratic set up over rural continued, there was no doubt that chola supremacy would have been very longer period.<br />Anbudan<br />Dhivakar<br />"R.venketesh" <abhivencat@yahoo.com  wrote:<br />Hi</abhivencat@yahoo.com></p>
<p>the reign of the last cholas. correct the figures if they are wrong.</p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola I 1070-1120 </p>
<p>Rajendra Chola III 1246-1279</p>
<p>so kulothunga onwards the cholas have ruled for 200 years</p>
<p>before them from vijayalaya( 848) to athirajenthra (1070) 222 years.</p>
<p>so the transition has come half way only.</p>
<p>did the slow down start because of inner rot or was it due to external <br />factors.</p>
<p>was there any major invasion of chola land after kulothunga?</p>

<p>  Why? Arignar Anna is often quoted on this: The moment one sits in <br />the<br />  Power Seat, he loses about 30% of votes ! His review clock runs ..</p>
<p>  PAZHUVETTARAYARS - KODUMBALUR CLAN - MALAYAMANs and others like <br />Kurunila<br />  Mannargal, supported a Chozha Kingdom when Sundara was in Power.<br />  Adithakarikalan was a mishap. Uthama was eligible to the Throne.<br />  Arumozhi set this right. Obviously became POPULAR. Became RRC. His <br />sons-<br />  grandsons ruled UNIFIED Kingdom.. annexed several neighbouring <br />Provinces<br />  .. Refer their Meykeerthis.</p>
<p>  The clans - which supported unifications became part of a MEGA <br />SYSTEM<br />  devoid of Independent Powers - not to its advantage.</p>
<p>  Such Clans did need power.. The disintegration process took place<br />  again...<br />  Sides were changed..</p>
<p>  Sundara Pandya conquered Rajraja III, but gave back power to rule as<br />  sub-ordinate. RR III did not maintain the conditions for Long.<br />  Found himself removed..</p>
<p>  Did this not happen in front of our eyes in Germany and the USSR..</p>

<p>  My point was that one can arouse feelings of<br />  nationalism in others by<br />  recounting tales of "nationalism"/bravery from<br />  another era. Just because the<br />  nationalism implied in Kalki's historical novels<br />  were not the same as the<br />  Freedom Era pan-India nationalism does not imply<br />  that it was somehow less<br />  in spirit. I think we both agree that Kalki did try<br />  and get the tamils to<br />  feel pride in their history/culture/language and by<br />  doing this, in trying to<br />  enthuse and arouse their spirits for the larger<br />  fight against the British<br />  Empire.</p>

<p>    -Hi</p>
<p>    okay agreed. but what sense of nationalism could<br />  such a book have<br />    given in times of an independence struggle? ( or<br />  for the matter in a<br />    freshly independent country)</p>
<p>    did it not enforce what the british were telling<br />  us all along. that<br />    india was full of warring tribes which they and<br />  they only united and<br />    if they left everything would go back to chaos.</p>
<p>    the individual nationalism is still alive even in<br />  this group.try<br />    talking to rahul dhinakaran about chola<br />  superiority and expecta mile<br />    long mail denying it.</p>
<p>    whaty kalki was trying to tell his readers was<br />  that " we were not<br />    always slaves. we were conquerors at one time. and<br />  those before us<br />    were brave in battle. not docile like us.</p>

<p>      I think Nationalism has to be seen in the<br />  context of the time that<br />    the story<br />      is set in. Nationalism in our current time means<br />  the geopgraphical<br />    entity of<br />      India. In the Chola/Chera/Pandya/Pallava times,<br />  nationalism meant a<br />    love for<br />      the respective kingdoms. In that sense<br />  VanthiyathevAn etc were Chola<br />      nationalists while even Ravidasan and co were<br />  Pandya nationalists.<br />    :)</p>

<p>          Sir,</p>
<p>          Kalki's forte was his ability to mix facts<br />  with the<br />          fiction. I remember one particular story<br />  well. It<br />          is called poimaan karadu. It is about a<br />  illusion in<br />          a hill that looks like a deer at some place<br />  near<br />          Namakkal. When traveled through the same<br />  route i<br />          could looking for similar kind of hill<br />  structure<br />          along the road.</p>
<p>          You may not be able to find nationalism in<br />  his<br />          historic writing may be, but his attachment<br />  to<br />          Rajaj and Gandhi is well known and can be<br />  seen in<br />          many of his non-fiction works.</p>

<p>          Hi Deepa</p>
<p>          you seem to know a lot about kalki for<br />  someone not<br />          familiar with the<br />          tamil script<br />          I am also reading kalki's short stories<br />  atleast one<br />          or two a week.<br />          I am able to see a common thread but what<br />          fascinated me was his<br />          obsession for life after death.<br />          for a descriptive man like kalki such<br />  situations<br />          are like halwa.he<br />          comes out in flying colours in such stories<br />  where<br />          he uses last life<br />          memories.</p>
<p>          his best was solaimalai ilavarasi where he<br />  spins a<br />          tale of a freedom<br />          fighter on the run after destroying a<br />  railway<br />          track. he hides in a<br />          dilapitated fort and is helped by a local<br />  girl who<br />          father is a staunch<br />          british supporter.<br />          he dreams of his past life in the same fort.<br />  the<br />          girl is there too in<br />          the past life.<br />          a very great portrayal of freedom fighting<br />  in 2<br />          eras. pre congress and<br />          post congress.</p>
<p>          that if you ask me is kalki's materpiece in<br />          nationalism.<br />          but frankly speaking kalki always talks<br />  about<br />          infighting with tamils<br />          or indians in his historic books. I dont<br />  think<br />          there was much<br />          nationalism involved in his historic books<br />  though<br />          they were deeply<br />          recorded in his alai osai and thyga bhomi.<br />          what he talked about was the victory of one<br />  indian<br />          clan over another.<br />          highly localised nationalism in fact. glad<br />  if you<br />          could point some<br />          instances of nationalism in his historic<br />  books.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>the reign of the last cholas. correct the figures if they are wrong.</p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola I	1070-1120	</p>
<p>Rajendra Chola III	1246-1279</p>
<p>so kulothunga onwards the cholas have ruled for 200 years</p>
<p>before them from vijayalaya( 848) to athirajenthra (1070) 222 years.</p>
<p>so the transition has come half way only.</p>
<p>did the slow down start because of inner rot or was it due to external <br />factors.</p>
<p>was there any major invasion of chola land after kulothunga?</p>

<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Hi<br />this is an opportune moment to discuss the down trend of the cholas.</p>
<p>if there is a peak( let it las a century) it means there is a slow or <br />hastened downslide after that.</p>
<p>if we take the peak to be <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  or even kulothunga how did the cholas <br />slide after that.</acronym></p>
<p>was it the lethargy that had set in over a few hundred years of enemy <br />less ruling???</p>
<p>or was it because a ruler was brought in from the daughters family to <br />continue the dynasty??( a similar event happened in the recent <br />thondaiman dynasty of pudukottai. where a boy was adopted from a <br />daughters family and the decline set in.</p>
<p>I am sure some members like venkatram dhiwaker- a novelist who has <br />worked on the later cholas, as well as (silent) shankaran who is an <br />expert of that period will participate.</p>
<p>regards<br />venketesh</p>

<p>    I think Nationalism has to be seen in the context of the time that<br />  the story<br />    is set in. Nationalism in our current time means the geopgraphical<br />  entity of<br />    India. In the Chola/Chera/Pandya/Pallava times, nationalism meant a<br />  love for<br />    the respective kingdoms. In that sense VanthiyathevAn etc were<br />Chola<br />    nationalists while even Ravidasan and co were Pandya nationalists.<br />  :)</p>

<p>        Kalki's forte was his ability to mix facts with the<br />        fiction. I remember one particular story well. It<br />        is called poimaan karadu.

<p>        Hi Deepa</p>
<p>        you seem to know a lot about kalki for someone not<br />        familiar with the<br />        tamil script<br />        I am also reading kalki's short stories atleast one<br />        or two a week.<br />        I am able to see a common thread but what<br />        fascinated me was his<br />        obsession for life after death.<br />        for a descriptive man like kalki such situations<br />        are like halwa.he<br />        comes out in flying colours in such stories where<br />        he uses last life<br />        memories.</p>
<p>        his best was solaimalai ilavarasi where he spins a<br />        tale of a freedom<br />        fighter on the run after destroying a railway<br />        track. he hides in a<br />        dilapitated fort and is helped by a local girl who<br />        father is a staunch<br />        british supporter.<br />        he dreams of his past life in the same fort. the<br />        girl is there too in<br />        the past life.<br />        a very great portrayal of freedom fighting in 2<br />        eras. pre congress and<br />        post congress.</p>
<p>        that if you ask me is kalki's materpiece in<br />        nationalism.<br />        but frankly speaking kalki always talks about<br />        infighting with tamils<br />        or indians in his historic books. I dont think<br />        there was much<br />        nationalism involved in his historic books though<br />        they were deeply<br />        recorded in his alai osai and thyga bhomi.<br />        what he talked about was the victory of one indian<br />        clan over another.<br />        highly localised nationalism in fact. glad if you<br />        could point some<br />        instances of nationalism in his historic books.</p>

<p>              Dear SPS<br />              In my opinion after having read the Kalki's<br />        many<br />            writtings, he<br />            must have been a multi talented personality. i<br />        see<br />            in him a<br />            naturalist, painter, historian, anthropologist,<br />            archaeologist,<br />            novolist,meteorologist,cilmatologist . still<br />        too may<br />            to mention.</p>
<p>            Hi<br />            isnt this glorification a little too much.<br />            Kalki was a great observer who could recall<br />        several<br />            of his<br />            observations in to his books.</p>
<p>            he was no expert in meterology just because he<br />            described a thunder<br />            storm.<br />            his history tells us he was an expert as a<br />        writer<br />            and music critic.</p>
<p>            I sincerely hope we can discuss kalki's<br />        pitfalls as<br />            well as his<br />            proficiencies.<br />            and for those who havent read the other works<br />        of<br />            kalki , please do<br />            and you will get a complete picture of the<br />        author.<br />            regards<br />            venketesh</p>

<p>whaty kalki was trying to tell his readers was that " we were not<br />always slaves. we were conquerors at one time. and those before us<br />were brave in battle. not docile like us.<br />========================================<br />Looking at it from 1950 angle...</p>
<p>But Kalki talks of our GLORY (Our - is more of South Indian - because of<br />the story line related to Chozhas it appears to be like that of <br />Chozhas.)</p>
<p>And cleverly he has not taken <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  or post <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  period. Imperial Chozhas<br />commences from <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  only.</p>
<p>He does talk the Glory of Pallavas.</p>
<p>Of course Thiagaboomi discusses freedom struggle in detail.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>you have a very valid point there.<br />parthiban kanavu especially the initial sequences of parthiban <br />dreaming of a great chola land ( which just was not possible in his <br />life time and pallavan giving an explantion of why he needed to annex <br />smaller nations- to have a common front against a larger enemy)<br />thats kalki's explanations to inquisitve people like us who question <br />his nationalism half a century later.</p>

<p>  okay agreed. but what sense of nationalism could such a book have <br />  given in times of an independence struggle? ( or for the matter in <br />a <br />  freshly independent country)</p>
<p>  did it not enforce what the british were telling us all along. that <br />  india was full of warring tribes which they and they only united <br />and <br />  if they left everything would go back to chaos.</p>

<p>    I think Nationalism has to be seen in the context of the time <br />that <br />  the story<br />    is set in. Nationalism in our current time means the <br />geopgraphical <br />  entity of<br />    India. In the Chola/Chera/Pandya/Pallava times, nationalism meant <br />a <br />  love for<br />    the respective kingdoms. In that sense VanthiyathevAn etc were <br />Chola<br />    nationalists while even Ravidasan and co were Pandya <br />nationalists. <br />  :)</p>

<p>            Hi<br />            isnt this glorification a little too much.<br />            Kalki was a great observer who could recall<br />        several<br />            of his<br />            observations in to his books.</p>
<p>            he was no expert in meterology just because he<br />            described a thunder<br />            storm.<br />            his history tells us he was an expert as a<br />        writer<br />            and music critic.</p>

        <p>Venketesh,</p>
<p>My point was that one can arouse feelings of nationalism in others by<br />recounting tales of "nationalism"/bravery from another era. Just because the<br />nationalism implied in Kalki's historical novels were not the same as the<br />Freedom Era pan-India nationalism does not imply that it was somehow less<br />in spirit. I think we both agree that Kalki did try and get the tamils to<br />feel pride in their history/culture/language and by doing this, in trying to<br />enthuse and arouse their spirits for the larger fight against the British<br />Empire.</p>

<p>        Sir,</p>
<p>        Kalki's forte was his ability to mix facts with the<br />        fiction. I remember one particular story well. It<br />        is called poimaan karadu. It is about a illusion in<br />        a hill that looks like a deer at some place near<br />        Namakkal. When traveled through the same route i<br />        could looking for similar kind of hill structure<br />        along the road.</p>
<p>        You may not be able to find nationalism in his<br />        historic writing may be, but his attachment to<br />        Rajaj and Gandhi is well known and can be seen in<br />        many of his non-fiction works.</p>

<p>        Hi Deepa</p>
<p>        you seem to know a lot about kalki for someone not<br />        familiar with the<br />        tamil script<br />        I am also reading kalki's short stories atleast one<br />        or two a week.<br />        I am able to see a common thread but what<br />        fascinated me was his<br />        obsession for life after death.<br />        for a descriptive man like kalki such situations<br />        are like halwa.he<br />        comes out in flying colours in such stories where<br />        he uses last life<br />        memories.</p>
<p>        his best was solaimalai ilavarasi where he spins a<br />        tale of a freedom<br />        fighter on the run after destroying a railway<br />        track. he hides in a<br />        dilapitated fort and is helped by a local girl who<br />        father is a staunch<br />        british supporter.<br />        he dreams of his past life in the same fort. the<br />        girl is there too in<br />        the past life.<br />        a very great portrayal of freedom fighting in 2<br />        eras. pre congress and<br />        post congress.</p>
<p>        that if you ask me is kalki's materpiece in<br />        nationalism.<br />        but frankly speaking kalki always talks about<br />        infighting with tamils<br />        or indians in his historic books. I dont think<br />        there was much<br />        nationalism involved in his historic books though<br />        they were deeply<br />        recorded in his alai osai and thyga bhomi.<br />        what he talked about was the victory of one indian<br />        clan over another.<br />        highly localised nationalism in fact. glad if you<br />        could point some<br />        instances of nationalism in his historic books.</p>

<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  was penned during a period when pride and self esteem of Tamizh population was at its lowest and honour consisted of identification with the British Regime (this phrase was coined by somebody in Orkut, i loved it) This is true even today when most of our grand parents take pride in that they served the Britisher. </p>
<p>Kalki actually showed us that we had a lot to be proud of (Mr.Venketesh is so true) by bringing the Tamizh history and culture into focus. I have heard that it was he who bought Bharatanatyam to the common man. Maybe some in our group could shed light on this. </p>

<p>      Sir,</p>
<p>      Kalki's forte was his ability to mix facts with the<br />      fiction. I remember one particular story well. It<br />      is called poimaan karadu. It is about a illusion in<br />      a hill that looks like a deer at some place near<br />      Namakkal. When traveled through the same route i<br />      could looking for similar kind of hill structure<br />      along the road.</p>
<p>      You may not be able to find nationalism in his<br />      historic writing may be, but his attachment to<br />      Rajaj and Gandhi is well known and can be seen in<br />      many of his non-fiction works.</p>

<p>      Hi Deepa</p>
<p>      you seem to know a lot about kalki for someone not<br />      familiar with the<br />      tamil script<br />      I am also reading kalki's short stories atleast one<br />      or two a week.<br />      I am able to see a common thread but what<br />      fascinated me was his<br />      obsession for life after death.<br />      for a descriptive man like kalki such situations<br />      are like halwa.he<br />      comes out in flying colours in such stories where<br />      he uses last life<br />      memories.</p>
<p>      his best was solaimalai ilavarasi where he spins a<br />      tale of a freedom<br />      fighter on the run after destroying a railway<br />      track. he hides in a<br />      dilapitated fort and is helped by a local girl who<br />      father is a staunch<br />      british supporter.<br />      he dreams of his past life in the same fort. the<br />      girl is there too in<br />      the past life.<br />      a very great portrayal of freedom fighting in 2<br />      eras. pre congress and<br />      post congress.</p>
<p>      that if you ask me is kalki's materpiece in<br />      nationalism.<br />      but frankly speaking kalki always talks about<br />      infighting with tamils<br />      or indians in his historic books. I dont think<br />      there was much<br />      nationalism involved in his historic books though<br />      they were deeply<br />      recorded in his alai osai and thyga bhomi.<br />      what he talked about was the victory of one indian<br />      clan over another.<br />      highly localised nationalism in fact. glad if you<br />      could point some<br />      instances of nationalism in his historic books.</p>

<p>        Hi Folks,<br />        There are some short stories of Kalki which are a<br />      tad<br />        boring. However, we must acknowledge the fact<br />      that he<br />        had a great gift of describing events in detail.<br />      Since<br />        we live many years away from the past, it is only<br />      but<br />        natural to get facinated by the way of life,<br />      stories<br />        and events of several centuries ago. The spirt of<br />        nationalism he tried to evoke with PS in those<br />      years<br />        is commendable.<br />        Good author when he had to write about past<br />      events.<br />        Great imagination. Sometimes unable to lace<br />      multiple<br />        events with no loopholes :)<br />        Best Wishes,<br />        Deepa</p>

<p>            Dear SPS<br />            In my opinion after having read the Kalki's<br />      many<br />          writtings, he<br />          must have been a multi talented personality. i<br />      see<br />          in him a<br />          naturalist, painter, historian, anthropologist,<br />          archaeologist,<br />          novolist,meteorologist,cilmatologist . still<br />      too may<br />          to mention.</p>
<p>          Hi<br />          isnt this glorification a little too much.<br />          Kalki was a great observer who could recall<br />      several<br />          of his<br />          observations in to his books.</p>
<p>          he was no expert in meterology just because he<br />          described a thunder<br />          storm.<br />          his history tells us he was an expert as a<br />      writer<br />          and music critic.</p>
<p>          I sincerely hope we can discuss kalki's<br />      pitfalls as<br />          well as his<br />          proficiencies.<br />          and for those who havent read the other works<br />      of<br />          kalki , please do<br />          and you will get a complete picture of the<br />      author.<br />          regards<br />          venketesh</p>

        <p>Hi;</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  was penned during a period when pride and self esteem of Tamizh<br />population was at its lowest and honour consisted of identification with the<br />British Regime (this phrase was coined by somebody in Orkut, i loved it)<br />This is true even today when most of our grand parents take pride in that<br />they served the Britisher.</acronym></p>
<p>Kalki actually showed us that we had a lot to be proud of (Mr.Venketesh is<br />so true) by bringing the Tamizh history and culture into focus. I have heard<br />that it was he who bought Bharatanatyam to the common man. Maybe some in our<br />group could shed light on this.</p>

<p>  okay agreed. but what sense of nationalism could such a book have<br />  given in times of an independence struggle? ( or for the matter in a<br />  freshly independent country)</p>
<p>  did it not enforce what the british were telling us all along. that<br />  india was full of warring tribes which they and they only united and<br />  if they left everything would go back to chaos.</p>
<p>  the individual nationalism is still alive even in this group.try<br />  talking to rahul dhinakaran about chola superiority and expecta mile<br />  long mail denying it.</p>
<p>  whaty kalki was trying to tell his readers was that " we were not<br />  always slaves. we were conquerors at one time. and those before us<br />  were brave in battle. not docile like us.</p>

<p>    I think Nationalism has to be seen in the context of the time that<br />  the story<br />    is set in. Nationalism in our current time means the geopgraphical<br />  entity of<br />    India. In the Chola/Chera/Pandya/Pallava times, nationalism meant a<br />  love for<br />    the respective kingdoms. In that sense VanthiyathevAn etc were Chola<br />    nationalists while even Ravidasan and co were Pandya nationalists.<br />  :)</p>

        <p>-Hi</p>
<p>okay agreed. but what sense of nationalism could such a book have <br />given in times of an independence struggle? ( or for the matter in a <br />freshly independent country)</p>
<p>did it not enforce what the british were telling us all along. that <br />india was full of warring tribes which they and they only united and <br />if they left everything would go back to chaos.</p>
<p>the individual nationalism is still alive even in this group.try <br />talking to rahul dhinakaran about chola superiority and expecta mile <br />long mail denying it.</p>
<p>whaty kalki was trying to tell his readers was that " we were not <br />always slaves. we were conquerors at one time. and those before us <br />were brave in battle. not docile like us.</p>

<p>      Sir,</p>
<p>      Kalki's forte was his ability to mix facts with the<br />      fiction. I remember one particular story well. It<br />      is called poimaan karadu. It is about a illusion in<br />      a hill that looks like a deer at some place near<br />      Namakkal. When traveled through the same route i<br />      could looking for similar kind of hill structure<br />      along the road.</p>
<p>      You may not be able to find nationalism in his<br />      historic writing may be, but his attachment to<br />      Rajaj and Gandhi is well known and can be seen in<br />      many of his non-fiction works.</p>

<p>      Hi Deepa</p>
<p>      you seem to know a lot about kalki for someone not<br />      familiar with the<br />      tamil script<br />      I am also reading kalki's short stories atleast one<br />      or two a week.<br />      I am able to see a common thread but what<br />      fascinated me was his<br />      obsession for life after death.<br />      for a descriptive man like kalki such situations<br />      are like halwa.he<br />      comes out in flying colours in such stories where<br />      he uses last life<br />      memories.</p>
<p>      his best was solaimalai ilavarasi where he spins a<br />      tale of a freedom<br />      fighter on the run after destroying a railway<br />      track. he hides in a<br />      dilapitated fort and is helped by a local girl who<br />      father is a staunch<br />      british supporter.<br />      he dreams of his past life in the same fort. the<br />      girl is there too in<br />      the past life.<br />      a very great portrayal of freedom fighting in 2<br />      eras. pre congress and<br />      post congress.</p>
<p>      that if you ask me is kalki's materpiece in<br />      nationalism.<br />      but frankly speaking kalki always talks about<br />      infighting with tamils<br />      or indians in his historic books. I dont think<br />      there was much<br />      nationalism involved in his historic books though<br />      they were deeply<br />      recorded in his alai osai and thyga bhomi.<br />      what he talked about was the victory of one indian<br />      clan over another.<br />      highly localised nationalism in fact. glad if you<br />      could point some<br />      instances of nationalism in his historic books.</p>

        <p>Sir,</p>
<p>Kalki's forte was his ability to mix facts with the fiction. I remember one particular story well. It is called poimaan karadu. It is about a illusion in a hill that looks like a deer at some place near Namakkal. When traveled through the same route i could looking for similar kind of hill structure along the road. </p>
<p>You may not be able to find nationalism in his historic writing may be, but his attachment to Rajaj and Gandhi is well known and can be seen in many of his non-fiction works.</p>

<p>you seem to know a lot about kalki for someone not familiar with the <br />tamil script<br />I am also reading kalki's short stories atleast one or two a week.<br />I am able to see a common thread but what fascinated me was his <br />obsession for life after death.<br />for a descriptive man like kalki such situations are like halwa.he <br />comes out in flying colours in such stories where he uses last life <br />memories.</p>
<p>his best was solaimalai ilavarasi where he spins a tale of a freedom <br />fighter on the run after destroying a railway track. he hides in a <br />dilapitated fort and is helped by a local girl who father is a staunch <br />british supporter.<br />he dreams of his past life in the same fort. the girl is there too in <br />the past life.<br />a very great portrayal of freedom fighting in 2 eras. pre congress and <br />post congress.</p>
<p>that if you ask me is kalki's materpiece in nationalism.<br />but frankly speaking kalki always talks about infighting with tamils <br />or indians in his historic books. I dont think there was much <br />nationalism involved in his historic books though they were deeply <br />recorded in his alai osai and thyga bhomi.<br />what he talked about was the victory of one indian clan over another.<br />highly localised nationalism in fact. glad if you could point some <br />instances of nationalism in his historic books.</p>

<p>    Hi <br />    isnt this glorification a little too much.<br />    Kalki was a great observer who could recall several<br />    of his <br />    observations in to his books.</p>
<p>    he was no expert in meterology just because he<br />    described a thunder <br />    storm.<br />    his history tells us he was an expert as a writer<br />    and music critic.</p>
