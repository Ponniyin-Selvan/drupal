</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Bodhidharma (early 6th century CE) was the Buddhist monk <br />traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little contemporary <br />biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent <br />accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts agree that he <br />was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China and <br />subsequently relocated northwards. Some claim Daruma Bodhidharma <br />(Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma) was the third child of the <br />Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, which would <br />make him an important influence on the martial arts of Asia in <br />general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu to <br />Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself have been <br />discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Matsuda <br />Ryuchi. </p>
<p>Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts before they <br />became two of the very first Shaolin monks??"years before the arrival <br />of Bodhidharma.The Taishō Tripiṭaka documents Sengchou's skillwith <br />the tin staff.</p>
<p>Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, intellectual <br />and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary for <br />enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment ultimately proved <br />highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made Zen their <br />way of life, following their encounter with the martial-arts-<br />oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in the 12th <br />century. Yet in some versions of his legend, Bodhidharma's focus was <br />so single-minded during his nine years of meditation that his legs <br />atrophied</p>

        <p>Very interesting information. Thank you.</p>

<p>Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai<br />The IAS saw its modest beginning in 1982 at Tiruvanmiyur, a <br />spiritual centre hallowed in the ancient literary and cultural <br />traditions of Asia. Since then it has grown to become one of India's <br />premier indological research and publication institutes.</p>
<p>Recently the Institute acquired two acres of choice land in <br />Kanchipuram to launch a Bodhidharma Centre for Indian Philosophy, <br />named after the South Indian Buddhist monk who traveled to China in <br />the 8th century AD and started the Ch'an (Japanese Zen) school of <br />Mahayana Buddhism.</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /><vj_episteme@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  could all this be true</p>
<p>  Kalangi Nathar was the guru of Bhogarnathar or Bhogar. Kalangi <br />  Nathar was from Benaras.</p>
<p>  Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. In <br />China <br />  he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi in <br />China <br />  was the successor of Kalangi Nathar(Confucius).</p>
<p>  Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar (a mystic, yogi). He <br />was <br />  said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New Age <br />  circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. Bhogar was <br />a <br />  South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, who <br />  became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. In <br />  Bogar's Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />  preparations to his disciple Pullippani (so named as he is <br />believed <br />  to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger) and at every <br />  stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani must <br />have <br />  been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a balaka.</p>
<p>  It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />proceeded <br />  to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />journey <br />  is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />  demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction of the <br />  aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a steam <br />  engine. The details of these and other experi- ments demonstrated <br />by <br />  Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.</p>
<p>  Bogar's guru, K?&#129;l?&#129;ngi N?&#129;thar, is believed to be a Chinese who <br />  attained siddhi in South India and thus became included among the <br />  Eighteen Siddhars.</p>
<p>  Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism (5th century B.C.) was the first <br />  Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the male <br />Yang <br />  and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of Shiva - <br />  Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept was <br />first <br />  revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is as old <br />  as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 B.C. <br />Also <br />  alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. 135 <br />and <br />  was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree was <br />  enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by the <br />  Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two existing <br />  Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir Refined <br />in <br />  Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.</p>
<p>  The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter and <br />  the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about the <br />  same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went under <br />the <br />  name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi Sriramadevar, <br />who <br />  was known as Yacob in Arabia.</p>
<p>  This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the concept of <br />  duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />alchemy <br />  as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />after <br />  Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher the <br />  emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy have <br />  been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao Tse by <br />  centuries.</p>
<p>  Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings will <br />  suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine he <br />  used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing these 9 <br />  poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />Master <br />  Medicine ( One medicine to cure all disease ). Thirumoolar also <br />  discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. With <br />  the consultation of Agasthiar ( Father of Ayurvedic Medicine) and <br />  other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons ( Nava Bashanam ) and <br />made <br />  the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is currently <br />  worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near Palani <br />  Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />mixed <br />  the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.</p>
<p>  Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />  panchamirtham ( a sweet recipe ) poured on the idol, one can <br />extract <br />  the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />becomes <br />  medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />Navabashana <br />  idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />  abishegam ( pouring milk on the idol ) and panchamirtha abishegam <br />( <br />  pouring panchamirtham on the idol ).</p>
<p>  His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />Murugan <br />  pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />samadhi <br />  stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />  Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. Actually <br />  Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />Murugan <br />  Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />entrance <br />  to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for this <br />  great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last seen <br />by <br />  his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at the top <br />  of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, has <br />  overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to its <br />  popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after him by <br />  sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal and <br />  private temple.</p>
<p>  During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan handed <br />  over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />  descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of this <br />right <br />  by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to some <br />  annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, the <br />  arrow which symbolises Subramanya's victory over asuras. Right to <br />be <br />  buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some of <br />them <br />  so chose.</p>

<p>Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai<br />The IAS saw its modest beginning in 1982 at Tiruvanmiyur, a <br />spiritual centre hallowed in the ancient literary and cultural <br />traditions of Asia. Since then it has grown to become one of India's <br />premier indological research and publication institutes.</p>
<p>Recently the Institute acquired two acres of choice land in <br />Kanchipuram to launch a Bodhidharma Centre for Indian Philosophy, <br />named after the South Indian Buddhist monk who traveled to China in <br />the 8th century AD and started the Ch'an (Japanese Zen) school of <br />Mahayana Buddhism.</p>

<p>This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the concept of <br />duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; alchemy <br />as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries after <br />Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher the <br />emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy have <br />been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao Tse by <br />centuries.</p>
<p>Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings will <br />suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine he <br />used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing these 9 <br />poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a Master <br />Medicine ( One medicine to cure all disease ). Thirumoolar also <br />discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. With <br />the consultation of Agasthiar ( Father of Ayurvedic Medicine) and <br />other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons ( Nava Bashanam ) and made <br />the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is currently <br />worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near Palani <br />Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar mixed <br />the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.</p>
<p>Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />panchamirtham ( a sweet recipe ) poured on the idol, one can extract <br />the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then becomes <br />medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan Navabashana <br />idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />abishegam ( pouring milk on the idol ) and panchamirtha abishegam ( <br />pouring panchamirtham on the idol ).</p>
<p>His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord Murugan <br />pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest samadhi <br />stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. Actually <br />Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord Murugan <br />Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The entrance <br />to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for this <br />great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last seen by <br />his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at the top <br />of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, has <br />overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to its <br />popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after him by <br />sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal and <br />private temple.</p>
<p>During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan handed <br />over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of this right <br />by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to some <br />annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, the <br />arrow which symbolises Subramanya's victory over asuras. Right to be <br />buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some of them <br />so chose.</p>

<p>  Bodhidharma (early 6th century CE) was the Buddhist monk <br />  traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little contemporary <br />  biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent <br />  accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts agree that <br />he <br />  was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China and <br />  subsequently relocated northwards. Some claim Daruma Bodhidharma <br />  (Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma) was the third child of the <br />  Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>  The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, which <br />would <br />  make him an important influence on the martial arts of Asia in <br />  general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu to <br />  Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself have <br />been <br />  discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Matsuda <br />  Ryuchi. </p>
<p>  Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts before they <br />  became two of the very first Shaolin monks…quot;years before the <br />arrival <br />  of Bodhidharma.The Taishō Tripiṭaka documents Sengchou's skill <br />with <br />  the tin staff.</p>
<p>  Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />intellectual <br />  and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary for <br />  enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment ultimately proved <br />  highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made Zen <br />their <br />  way of life, following their encounter with the martial-arts-<br />  oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in the <br />12th <br />  century. Yet in some versions of his legend, Bodhidharma's focus <br />was <br />  so single-minded during his nine years of meditation that his legs <br />  atrophied</p>
