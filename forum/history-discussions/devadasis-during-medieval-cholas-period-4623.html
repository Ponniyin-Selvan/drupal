<p>Temple Women in Medieval Tamilnadu</p>
<p>Leslie C. Orre</p>
<p>New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. 305 pp.</p>
<p>The figure of the devadasi, or `temple-woman', who entertained Hindu<br />gods at festivals, hardly needs an introduction. Because of her<br />supposed sexual availability, the devadasi became a potent and<br />notorious symbol of the corruption of Hindu society. Together,<br />colonial officials and Indian reformers legislated the devadasi out of<br />existence and sanitized her dance traditions.<br />More recently, scholars have reacted to this legacy by stressing the<br />importance of the devadasi's ritual dance and sexuality in royal and<br />temple ritual. What unites both of these interpretations is their<br />assumption that the devadasi institution as `discovered' during the<br />colonial period reflects an India-wide tradition that stretches back<br />to the early reaches of Indian history.</p>
<p>This book, through an exhaustive and detailed study of medieval<br />inscriptions, effectively challenges the image of the devadasi<br />inherited from modern reform and recent scholarship.</p>
<p>Orr maintains that inscriptions, unlike literary texts and normative<br />representations, reveal the actuality of temple women's lives, as they<br />record specific events involving real people. Orr has examined the<br />entirety of the Chola (c. 950-1250) inscriptional corpus (and a good<br />deal more). The choice justified by the evidence itself, since the<br />Chola records give a more complete profile on `temple women' than<br />north Indian inscriptions, (though other south Indian languages have<br />rich stores of evidence which remain to be tapped).</p>
<p>Orr begins with the problem of terminology, noting that the term<br />devadasi, apparently a Sanskritization of the Tamil word tevara? iy? ?<br />(tevaratiyal) (, was neither ubiquitous nor even widespread in<br />medieval inscriptions, but only gained currency in the last century.<br />In pre-colonial times, the historian encounters a plethora of terms<br />which vary across region, language and period. </p>
<p>In the second chapter, Orr concludes on the basis of her survey of the<br />Chola materials that rather than the modern figure of the devadasi,<br />the inscriptions suggest a more general category of `temple women'.<br />The overlapping of terms like tevara? iy? ? (tevaratiyal), teva? ? r<br />maka? (tevanar makal) , patiyil? r (patiyilar), and ta? iyil? r<br />(taliyilar) , along with the mention of functions, privileges and<br />specific associations with temples, indicate, according to Orr, the<br />category of `temple woman' as a coherent social identity.</p>
<p>The author compares temple women to other types of women found in<br />inscriptions, most notably palace women. Orr argues, against the<br />conclusions of other scholars, that during the Chola period there was<br />no close relationship between court and temple. An enquiry into the<br />Tamil terms for temple woman, is equally corrective, according to Orr.<br />The term a? iy? r (atiyar), often translated as `slave' or `servant',<br />probably instead indicated the idea of a `retainer' for a king. It<br />also carried with it honorific connotations rooted in the south Indian<br />religious ethos of devotion. In comparison with terms from other parts<br />of India referring to temple women, which often meant slave or<br />prostitute, Orr finds that the Tamil terms are more honorific and<br />devotional in meaning.</p>
<p>Temple women appear most frequently in inscriptions as `donors',<br />making gifts of various kinds to the temples themselves, and the third<br />chapter of the book analyses this aspect of the evidence. Compared to<br />other women and men associated with temples, temple women appear as<br />donors in increasing numbers throughout the course of the Chola<br />period, and as time passed, were increasingly implicated in the life<br />of numerous temples throughout Tamilnadu as a consequence of their<br />donations.</p>
<p>Their appearance as donors leads to the question of their possession<br />of property and wealth. According to the dharma? ? stras (dharm a<br />sastras), Orr points out, a woman's access to wealth was generally<br />mediated through her husband. But as Chola temple women remained<br />unmarried, it seems, the question of where these women accumulated the<br />wealth to make gifts to temples is both relevant, and given the<br />author's wish to avoid the sacred prostitution theory, a crucial one.<br />Orr speculates that their wealth came from gifts by natal families or<br />inheritances from their mother as well as worship service performed on<br />behalf of other temple patrons.</p>
<p>Whatever their source of wealth, the conclusion is that in relation<br />to married women, temple women seemed to enjoy increasing economic<br />power and prosperity through the Chola period due to their<br />relationships with temples.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth chapters focus, respectively, on the work of<br />temple women and their identity with respect to geography, religion<br />and kinship. In contrast to their male counterparts, the role of women<br />in temple ritual, it would seem, was often incidental and optional.<br />They were neither ritual `specialists' nor a ritual `necessity' for<br />the temple as some scholarship has recently maintained.</p>
<p>They were most certainly not associated primarily with dance. Of the<br />304 Chola inscriptions that mention temple women, only four, according<br />to Orr, use terms that refer to `dancer'. More important was their<br />role in menial work (cleaning pots and pans, washing floors), and<br />performance of attendance functions like flywhisk bearing and dancing.<br />Women's role in both of these occupations, one debased and the other<br />exalted, increased throughout the Chola period. </p>
<p>Women in many cases received honoured status in temple ritual as a<br />result of their donations, but in some (about half of the references<br />that mention temple service) they seemed to received minimal living<br />`stipends', which may have indicated that they entered temple service<br />under conditions not of their own making.</p>
<p>For most women, concludes Orr, temple service was not a source of<br />livelihood, (excepting `slaves' acquired by the temple to perform<br />menial services), but was a way `to enhance status that was already<br />theirs' (134). </p>
<p>Temple women, geographically spread throughout the Chola realm, show<br />strong identification in the early Chola periods with deities of<br />particular places, but as time wore on, are increasingly referred to<br />in relation to particular temples, reflecting a general trend to a<br />more temple-based authority structure in the post-Chola period.<br />Women's temple service, according to Orr, was not in most cases<br />hereditary, reflecting what she claims to be a general social fluidity<br />during Chola times.</p>
<p>The book places the history of temple women within the context of<br />temples emerging as the dominant centres of economic and political<br />power as the Chola state declined. While such arguments are<br />tantalising, they remain somewhat fragmentary, and the chief thrust of<br />the book remains its engagement with the image of the devadasi<br />inherited by the debates, reforms and studies of the last century. By<br />its end, this image of the devadasi ? as sexually exploited temple<br />dancer/prostitute or the embodiment of sacred feminine power ? can<br />hardly be sustained in any simple or unqualified way. </p>
<p>In the final section of the conclusion, the author attempts to trace<br />briefly how the institution encountered in the 19th century by<br />colonial officials had evolved from the Chola period. She sees the<br />post-Chola, Vijayanagar, and Nayak periods as bringing a steady<br />decline in the power of women. An increase in feminine symbolism and<br />goddess imagery was accompanied by a decline in the `public'<br />representation of women and decreasing agency in political economic<br />and religious spheres. Hence the modern devadasi.</p>
<p>The alternative image of the temple woman that Orr draws for the Chola<br />period, however, raises many questions. That the turn to inscriptions<br />can illuminate the lives of women in medieval India is surely proved<br />beyond doubt by this book. </p>
<p>The book also demonstrates, however, the limitations of an<br />over-reliance on inscriptions to the detriment of other sorts of<br />evidence, and perhaps more importantly, a coherent social/theoretical<br />framework. Inscriptions, as the author points out, record only certain<br />types of events, revealing fragments rather than an entire picture.<br />Their interpretation is not so straightforward.</p>
<p>If the copious inscriptions recovered from the Chola period have<br />supported at least three models of the south Indian state, they are<br />certainly capable of revealing several different images of the devadasi.</p>
<p>At a general level, Orr claims that in the Chola period there was no<br />intimate sharing of ritual forms, dance, music, and personnel between<br />the domains of the temple and court. She substantiates this on the<br />paucity of inscriptions which refer to women as both tevar? ? iya?<br />(tevararatiyal) and `palace woman'. </p>
<p>To my mind, this sort of evidence does nothing to establish the<br />argument that courtly and temple ritual were unrelated. It is not at<br />all surprising that temple women would not be affiliated to the<br />palace, since direct service to two masters in a patriarchal system<br />could hardly be the norm. Because the servants of one household do not<br />name themselves as the servants of another can hardly serve as<br />evidence that these households are run differently. </p>
<p>Moreover, much other evidence cited by the book would seems to suggest<br />the contrary, that there was in fact considerable parity between the<br />practices of the palace and temple ? that the baths, meals, speech and<br />buildings of both kings and gods are spoken of with the same<br />vocabulary. The Chola period textual evidence is significant in this<br />regard, as both architectural texts like Mayamata, as well as the ea<br />rly pirapantam literature in Tamil, some of which refer to specific<br />ritual events (like the ul? (ula) or processional description),<br />clearly envision human and divine lords similarly.</p>
<p>Equally vexing is the `legal' status of temple women. Orr maintains on<br />the basis of the `honorific' character of the term a? iy? r (atiyar)<br />in Tamil bhakti traditions and its use to denote royal `attendants',<br />that tevara? iy? ? (tevaratiyal) were not in fact `subalterns' or<br />slaves. She distinguishes these, who formed the demographic majority<br />of temple women, from those who in the later Chola period clearly<br />entered into temple service as slaves. While such a distinction may be<br />plausible, it is vitiated by the lack of any discussion of the<br />legal/theoretical boundaries of slavery, service, bondage and attendance.</p>
<p>The inscriptions which record women's donations, often in exchange<br />for privileges in temple ritual, are for their part ambiguous: they do<br />not clearly spell out the nature of the relationship which constituted<br />them as tevara? iy? r (tevaratiyar) in the first place. Orr seems to<br />believe that such women had no obligation to temples, since none are<br />mentioned in the inscriptions.</p>
<p>The fact that temple women were able to make donations raises related<br />issues as to the relative freedom to accumulate wealth and what the<br />sources of such wealth may have been. It is not necessary to assume,<br />as Orr apparently does, that the accumulation of limited amounts of<br />wealth precluded relations of obligation or servitude. How such wealth<br />would have been obtained, of course, is unclear, as the inscriptions<br />are relatively silent on the matter. </p>
<p>Orr suggests, borrowing from the contemporary studies she is otherwise<br />keen to distance herself from, that it was gained by performing acts<br />of worship for patrons. Very plausible, but why should we reject the<br />same accounts which suggest that sexual favours also formed a source<br />of income? If the inscriptional record is silent on this matter, what<br />is the justification for borrowing from the ethnographic evidence in<br />such a selective manner?</p>
<p>The `gender' perspective claimed by the book seems to amount to little<br />more than comparing demographic profiles of men and women in<br />inscriptions, rather than seeing gender as a set of ideologies and<br />practices that form subjectivities and agencies. Orr's indifference to<br />the more `symbolic' or `discursive' elements of gender and dismissal<br />of textual evidence has sadly handicapped a study which otherwise may<br />have added something to what most accounts of women in medieval India<br />are vitally missing. </p>
<p>It is healthy to use inscriptions as a corrective to the idealising<br />and unrooted nature of textual analysis, but it is hardly adequate to<br />ignore such sources altogether. What the inscriptions can tell us is<br />in many ways as fragmentary as the literary sources. Even more<br />fundamental is Orr's seeming understanding of `agency' and<br />disempowerment as mutually exclusive categories, in a sort of<br />statistical zero-sum game. The overarching theoretical framework of<br />the book, to demonstrate that women exercised agency, is pursued at<br />the cost of theorising their oppression. </p>
<p>Agency is hardly so simple, as most forms of oppression sustain<br />themselves by actually bestowing certain types of agency to their<br />victims. This is precisely how ideas of servitude and bhakti in<br />medieval India functioned at once to `empower' subaltern classes and<br />compromise their autonomous agency ? making bhakti perennially<br />availability for both elitist and subaltern agendas. </p>
<p>The complexity of the temple woman's position, one feels, is missing<br />from this book.</p>

<p>  Book review</p>
<p>  Temple Women in Medieval Tamilnadu</p>
<p>  Leslie C. Orre</p>
<p>  New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. 305 pp.</p>
<p>  The figure of the devadasi, or `temple-woman', who entertained <br />Hindu<br />  gods at festivals, hardly needs an introduction. Because of her<br />  supposed sexual availability, the devadasi became a potent and<br />  notorious symbol of the corruption of Hindu society. Together,<br />  colonial officials and Indian reformers legislated the devadasi <br />out of<br />  existence and sanitized her dance traditions.<br />  More recently, scholars have reacted to this legacy by stressing <br />the<br />  importance of the devadasi's ritual dance and sexuality in royal <br />and<br />  temple ritual. What unites both of these interpretations is their<br />  assumption that the devadasi institution as `discovered' during the<br />  colonial period reflects an India-wide tradition that stretches <br />back<br />  to the early reaches of Indian history.</p>
<p>  This book, through an exhaustive and detailed study of medieval<br />  inscriptions, effectively challenges the image of the devadasi<br />  inherited from modern reform and recent scholarship.</p>
<p>  Orr maintains that inscriptions, unlike literary texts and <br />normative<br />  representations, reveal the actuality of temple women's lives, as <br />they<br />  record specific events involving real people. Orr has examined the<br />  entirety of the Chola (c. 950-1250) inscriptional corpus (and a <br />good<br />  deal more). The choice justified by the evidence itself, since the<br />  Chola records give a more complete profile on `temple women' than<br />  north Indian inscriptions, (though other south Indian languages <br />have<br />  rich stores of evidence which remain to be tapped).</p>
<p>  Orr begins with the problem of terminology, noting that the term<br />  devadasi, apparently a Sanskritization of the Tamil word tevara? <br />iy?   (tevaratiyal) (, was neither ubiquitous nor even widespread in<br />  medieval inscriptions, but only gained currency in the last <br />century.<br />  In pre-colonial times, the historian encounters a plethora of terms<br />  which vary across region, language and period. </p>
<p>  In the second chapter, Orr concludes on the basis of her survey of <br />the<br />  Chola materials that rather than the modern figure of the devadasi,<br />  the inscriptions suggest a more general category of `temple women'.<br />  The overlapping of terms like tevara? iy?  (tevaratiyal), teva?r<br />  maka (tevanar makal) , patiyil? r (patiyilar), and ta iyil? r<br />  (taliyilar) , along with the mention of functions, privileges and<br />  specific associations with temples, indicate, according to Orr, the<br />  category of `temple woman' as a coherent social identity.</p>
<p>  The author compares temple women to other types of women found in<br />  inscriptions, most notably palace women. Orr argues, against the<br />  conclusions of other scholars, that during the Chola period there <br />was<br />  no close relationship between court and temple. An enquiry into the<br />  Tamil terms for temple woman, is equally corrective, according to <br />Orr.<br />  The term a? iy? r (atiyar), often translated as `slave' or <br />`servant',<br />  probably instead indicated the idea of a `retainer' for a king. It<br />  also carried with it honorific connotations rooted in the south <br />Indian<br />  religious ethos of devotion. In comparison with terms from other <br />parts<br />  of India referring to temple women, which often meant slave or<br />  prostitute, Orr finds that the Tamil terms are more honorific and<br />  devotional in meaning.</p>
<p>  Temple women appear most frequently in inscriptions as `donors',<br />  making gifts of various kinds to the temples themselves, and the <br />third<br />  chapter of the book analyses this aspect of the evidence. Compared <br />to<br />  other women and men associated with temples, temple women appear as<br />  donors in increasing numbers throughout the course of the Chola<br />  period, and as time passed, were increasingly implicated in the <br />life<br />  of numerous temples throughout Tamilnadu as a consequence of their<br />  donations.</p>
<p>  Their appearance as donors leads to the question of their <br />possession<br />  of property and wealth. According to the dharma? ? stras (dharm a<br />  sastras), Orr points out, a woman's access to wealth was generally<br />  mediated through her husband. But as Chola temple women remained<br />  unmarried, it seems, the question of where these women accumulated <br />the<br />  wealth to make gifts to temples is both relevant, and given the<br />  author's wish to avoid the sacred prostitution theory, a crucial <br />one.<br />  Orr speculates that their wealth came from gifts by natal families <br />or<br />  inheritances from their mother as well as worship service <br />performed on<br />  behalf of other temple patrons.</p>
<p>  Whatever their source of wealth, the conclusion is that in <br />relation<br />  to married women, temple women seemed to enjoy increasing economic<br />  power and prosperity through the Chola period due to their<br />  relationships with temples.</p>
<p>  The fourth and fifth chapters focus, respectively, on the work of<br />  temple women and their identity with respect to geography, religion<br />  and kinship. In contrast to their male counterparts, the role of <br />women<br />  in temple ritual, it would seem, was often incidental and optional.<br />  They were neither ritual `specialists' nor a ritual `necessity' for<br />  the temple as some scholarship has recently maintained.</p>
<p>  They were most certainly not associated primarily with dance. Of <br />the<br />  304 Chola inscriptions that mention temple women, only four, <br />according<br />  to Orr, use terms that refer to `dancer'. More important was their<br />  role in menial work (cleaning pots and pans, washing floors), and<br />  performance of attendance functions like flywhisk bearing and <br />dancing.<br />  Women's role in both of these occupations, one debased and the <br />other<br />  exalted, increased throughout the Chola period. </p>
<p>  Women in many cases received honoured status in temple ritual as a<br />  result of their donations, but in some (about half of the <br />references<br />  that mention temple service) they seemed to received minimal living<br />  `stipends', which may have indicated that they entered temple <br />service<br />  under conditions not of their own making.</p>
<p>  For most women, concludes Orr, temple service was not a source of<br />  livelihood, (excepting `slaves' acquired by the temple to perform<br />  menial services), but was a way `to enhance status that was already<br />  theirs' (134). </p>
<p>  Temple women, geographically spread throughout the Chola realm, <br />show<br />  strong identification in the early Chola periods with deities of<br />  particular places, but as time wore on, are increasingly referred <br />to<br />  in relation to particular temples, reflecting a general trend to a<br />  more temple-based authority structure in the post-Chola period.<br />  Women's temple service, according to Orr, was not in most cases<br />  hereditary, reflecting what she claims to be a general social <br />fluidity<br />  during Chola times.</p>
<p>  The book places the history of temple women within the context of<br />  temples emerging as the dominant centres of economic and political<br />  power as the Chola state declined. While such arguments are<br />  tantalising, they remain somewhat fragmentary, and the chief <br />thrust of<br />  the book remains its engagement with the image of the devadasi<br />  inherited by the debates, reforms and studies of the last century. <br />By<br />  its end, this image of the devadasi ? as sexually exploited temple<br />  dancer/prostitute or the embodiment of sacred feminine power ? can<br />  hardly be sustained in any simple or unqualified way. </p>
<p>  In the final section of the conclusion, the author attempts to <br />trace<br />  briefly how the institution encountered in the 19th century by<br />  colonial officials had evolved from the Chola period. She sees the<br />  post-Chola, Vijayanagar, and Nayak periods as bringing a steady<br />  decline in the power of women. An increase in feminine symbolism <br />and<br />  goddess imagery was accompanied by a decline in the `public'<br />  representation of women and decreasing agency in political economic<br />  and religious spheres. Hence the modern devadasi.</p>
<p>  The alternative image of the temple woman that Orr draws for the <br />Chola<br />  period, however, raises many questions. That the turn to <br />inscriptions<br />  can illuminate the lives of women in medieval India is surely <br />proved<br />  beyond doubt by this book. </p>
<p>  The book also demonstrates, however, the limitations of an<br />  over-reliance on inscriptions to the detriment of other sorts of<br />  evidence, and perhaps more importantly, a coherent <br />social/theoretical<br />  framework. Inscriptions, as the author points out, record only <br />certain<br />  types of events, revealing fragments rather than an entire picture.<br />  Their interpretation is not so straightforward.</p>
<p>  If the copious inscriptions recovered from the Chola period have<br />  supported at least three models of the south Indian state, they are<br />  certainly capable of revealing several different images of the <br />devadasi.</p>
<p>  At a general level, Orr claims that in the Chola period there was <br />no<br />  intimate sharing of ritual forms, dance, music, and personnel <br />between<br />  the domains of the temple and court. She substantiates this on the<br />  paucity of inscriptions which refer to women as both tevar? ? <br />iya  (tevararatiyal) and `palace woman'. </p>
<p>  To my mind, this sort of evidence does nothing to establish the<br />  argument that courtly and temple ritual were unrelated. It is not <br />at<br />  all surprising that temple women would not be affiliated to the<br />  palace, since direct service to two masters in a patriarchal system<br />  could hardly be the norm. Because the servants of one household do <br />not<br />  name themselves as the servants of another can hardly serve as<br />  evidence that these households are run differently. </p>
<p>  Moreover, much other evidence cited by the book would seems to <br />suggest<br />  the contrary, that there was in fact considerable parity between <br />the<br />  practices of the palace and temple ? that the baths, meals, speech <br />and<br />  buildings of both kings and gods are spoken of with the same<br />  vocabulary. The Chola period textual evidence is significant in <br />this<br />  regard, as both architectural texts like Mayamata, as well as the <br />ea<br />  rly pirapantam literature in Tamil, some of which refer to specific<br />  ritual events (like the ul? (ula) or processional description),<br />  clearly envision human and divine lords similarly.</p>
<p>  Equally vexing is the `legal' status of temple women. Orr <br />maintains on<br />  the basis of the `honorific' character of the term a? iy? r <br />(atiyar)<br />  in Tamil bhakti traditions and its use to denote royal <br />`attendants',<br />  that tevara? iy?  (tevaratiyal) were not in fact `subalterns' or<br />  slaves. She distinguishes these, who formed the demographic <br />majority<br />  of temple women, from those who in the later Chola period clearly<br />  entered into temple service as slaves. While such a distinction <br />may be<br />  plausible, it is vitiated by the lack of any discussion of the<br />  legal/theoretical boundaries of slavery, service, bondage and <br />attendance.</p>
<p>  The inscriptions which record women's donations, often in exchange<br />  for privileges in temple ritual, are for their part ambiguous: <br />they do<br />  not clearly spell out the nature of the relationship which <br />constituted<br />  them as tevara? iy? r (tevaratiyar) in the first place. Orr seems <br />to<br />  believe that such women had no obligation to temples, since none <br />are<br />  mentioned in the inscriptions.</p>
<p>  The fact that temple women were able to make donations raises <br />related<br />  issues as to the relative freedom to accumulate wealth and what the<br />  sources of such wealth may have been. It is not necessary to <br />assume,<br />  as Orr apparently does, that the accumulation of limited amounts of<br />  wealth precluded relations of obligation or servitude. How such <br />wealth<br />  would have been obtained, of course, is unclear, as the <br />inscriptions<br />  are relatively silent on the matter. </p>
<p>  Orr suggests, borrowing from the contemporary studies she is <br />otherwise<br />  keen to distance herself from, that it was gained by performing <br />acts<br />  of worship for patrons. Very plausible, but why should we reject <br />the<br />  same accounts which suggest that sexual favours also formed a <br />source<br />  of income? If the inscriptional record is silent on this matter, <br />what<br />  is the justification for borrowing from the ethnographic evidence <br />in<br />  such a selective manner?</p>
<p>  The `gender' perspective claimed by the book seems to amount to <br />little<br />  more than comparing demographic profiles of men and women in<br />  inscriptions, rather than seeing gender as a set of ideologies and<br />  practices that form subjectivities and agencies. Orr's <br />indifference to<br />  the more `symbolic' or `discursive' elements of gender and <br />dismissal<br />  of textual evidence has sadly handicapped a study which otherwise <br />may<br />  have added something to what most accounts of women in medieval <br />India<br />  are vitally missing. </p>
<p>  It is healthy to use inscriptions as a corrective to the idealising<br />  and unrooted nature of textual analysis, but it is hardly adequate <br />to<br />  ignore such sources altogether. What the inscriptions can tell us <br />is<br />  in many ways as fragmentary as the literary sources. Even more<br />  fundamental is Orr's seeming understanding of `agency' and<br />  disempowerment as mutually exclusive categories, in a sort of<br />  statistical zero-sum game. The overarching theoretical framework of<br />  the book, to demonstrate that women exercised agency, is pursued at<br />  the cost of theorising their oppression. </p>
<p>  Agency is hardly so simple, as most forms of oppression sustain<br />  themselves by actually bestowing certain types of agency to their<br />  victims. This is precisely how ideas of servitude and bhakti in<br />  medieval India functioned at once to `empower' subaltern classes <br />and<br />  compromise their autonomous agency ? making bhakti perennially<br />  availability for both elitist and subaltern agendas. </p>
<p>  The complexity of the temple woman's position, one feels, is <br />missing<br />  from this book.</p>

<p>  Orr maintains that inscriptions, unlike literary texts and normative<br />  representations, reveal the actuality of temple women's lives, as <br />they<br />  record specific events involving real people. Orr has examined the<br />  entirety of the Chola (c. 950-1250) inscriptional corpus (and a good<br />  deal more). The choice justified by the evidence itself, since the<br />  Chola records give a more complete profile on `temple women' than<br />  north Indian inscriptions, (though other south Indian languages have<br />  rich stores of evidence which remain to be tapped).</p>
<p>  Orr begins with the problem of terminology, noting that the term<br />  devadasi, apparently a Sanskritization of the Tamil word <br />tevara&shy; iy? ?<br />  (tevaratiyal) (, was neither ubiquitous nor even widespread in<br />  medieval inscriptions, but only gained currency in the last century.<br />  In pre-colonial times, the historian encounters a plethora of terms<br />  which vary across region, language and period. </p>
<p>  In the second chapter, Orr concludes on the basis of her survey of <br />the<br />  Chola materials that rather than the modern figure of the devadasi,<br />  the inscriptions suggest a more general category of `temple women'.<br />  The overlapping of terms like tevara&shy; iy? ? (tevaratiyal), <br />teva? ? r<br />  maka? (tevanar makal) , patiyil? r (patiyilar), and ta? iyil? r<br />  (taliyilar) , along with the mention of functions, privileges and<br />  specific associations with temples, indicate, according to Orr, the<br />  category of `temple woman' as a coherent social identity.</p>
<p>  The author compares temple women to other types of women found in<br />  inscriptions, most notably palace women. Orr argues, against the<br />  conclusions of other scholars, that during the Chola period there <br />was<br />  no close relationship between court and temple. An enquiry into the<br />  Tamil terms for temple woman, is equally corrective, according to <br />Orr.<br />  The term a&shy; iy? r (atiyar), often translated as `slave' or <br />`servant',<br />  probably instead indicated the idea of a `retainer' for a king. It<br />  also carried with it honorific connotations rooted in the south <br />Indian<br />  religious ethos of devotion. In comparison with terms from other <br />parts<br />  of India referring to temple women, which often meant slave or<br />  prostitute, Orr finds that the Tamil terms are more honorific and<br />  devotional in meaning.</p>
<p>  Temple women appear most frequently in inscriptions as `donors',<br />  making gifts of various kinds to the temples themselves, and the <br />third<br />  chapter of the book analyses this aspect of the evidence. Compared <br />to<br />  other women and men associated with temples, temple women appear as<br />  donors in increasing numbers throughout the course of the Chola<br />  period, and as time passed, were increasingly implicated in the life<br />  of numerous temples throughout Tamilnadu as a consequence of their<br />  donations.</p>
<p>  Their appearance as donors leads to the question of their possession<br />  of property and wealth. According to the dharma? ? stras (dharm a<br />  sastras), Orr points out, a woman's access to wealth was generally<br />  mediated through her husband. But as Chola temple women remained<br />  unmarried, it seems, the question of where these women accumulated <br />the<br />  wealth to make gifts to temples is both relevant, and given the<br />  author's wish to avoid the sacred prostitution theory, a crucial <br />one.<br />  Orr speculates that their wealth came from gifts by natal families <br />or<br />  inheritances from their mother as well as worship service performed <br />on<br />  behalf of other temple patrons.</p>
<p>  Whatever their source of wealth, the conclusion is that in relation<br />  to married women, temple women seemed to enjoy increasing economic<br />  power and prosperity through the Chola period due to their<br />  relationships with temples.</p>
<p>  The fourth and fifth chapters focus, respectively, on the work of<br />  temple women and their identity with respect to geography, religion<br />  and kinship. In contrast to their male counterparts, the role of <br />women<br />  in temple ritual, it would seem, was often incidental and optional.<br />  They were neither ritual `specialists' nor a ritual `necessity' for<br />  the temple as some scholarship has recently maintained.</p>
<p>  They were most certainly not associated primarily with dance. Of the<br />  304 Chola inscriptions that mention temple women, only four, <br />according<br />  to Orr, use terms that refer to `dancer'. More important was their<br />  role in menial work (cleaning pots and pans, washing floors), and<br />  performance of attendance functions like flywhisk bearing and <br />dancing.<br />  Women's role in both of these occupations, one debased and the other<br />  exalted, increased throughout the Chola period. </p>
<p>  Women in many cases received honoured status in temple ritual as a<br />  result of their donations, but in some (about half of the references<br />  that mention temple service) they seemed to received minimal living<br />  `stipends', which may have indicated that they entered temple <br />service<br />  under conditions not of their own making.</p>
<p>  For most women, concludes Orr, temple service was not a source of<br />  livelihood, (excepting `slaves' acquired by the temple to perform<br />  menial services), but was a way `to enhance status that was already<br />  theirs' (134). </p>
<p>  Temple women, geographically spread throughout the Chola realm, show<br />  strong identification in the early Chola periods with deities of<br />  particular places, but as time wore on, are increasingly referred to<br />  in relation to particular temples, reflecting a general trend to a<br />  more temple-based authority structure in the post-Chola period.<br />  Women's temple service, according to Orr, was not in most cases<br />  hereditary, reflecting what she claims to be a general social <br />fluidity<br />  during Chola times.</p>
<p>  The book places the history of temple women within the context of<br />  temples emerging as the dominant centres of economic and political<br />  power as the Chola state declined. While such arguments are<br />  tantalising, they remain somewhat fragmentary, and the chief thrust <br />of<br />  the book remains its engagement with the image of the devadasi<br />  inherited by the debates, reforms and studies of the last century. <br />By<br />  its end, this image of the devadasi ? as sexually exploited temple<br />  dancer/prostitute or the embodiment of sacred feminine power ? can<br />  hardly be sustained in any simple or unqualified way. </p>
<p>  In the final section of the conclusion, the author attempts to trace<br />  briefly how the institution encountered in the 19th century by<br />  colonial officials had evolved from the Chola period. She sees the<br />  post-Chola, Vijayanagar, and Nayak periods as bringing a steady<br />  decline in the power of women. An increase in feminine symbolism and<br />  goddess imagery was accompanied by a decline in the `public'<br />  representation of women and decreasing agency in political economic<br />  and religious spheres. Hence the modern devadasi.</p>
<p>  The alternative image of the temple woman that Orr draws for the <br />Chola<br />  period, however, raises many questions. That the turn to <br />inscriptions<br />  can illuminate the lives of women in medieval India is surely proved<br />  beyond doubt by this book. </p>
<p>  The book also demonstrates, however, the limitations of an<br />  over-reliance on inscriptions to the detriment of other sorts of<br />  evidence, and perhaps more importantly, a coherent social/<br />theoretical<br />  framework. Inscriptions, as the author points out, record only <br />certain<br />  types of events, revealing fragments rather than an entire picture.<br />  Their interpretation is not so straightforward.</p>
<p>  If the copious inscriptions recovered from the Chola period have<br />  supported at least three models of the south Indian state, they are<br />  certainly capable of revealing several different images of the <br />devadasi.</p>
<p>  At a general level, Orr claims that in the Chola period there was no<br />  intimate sharing of ritual forms, dance, music, and personnel <br />between<br />  the domains of the temple and court. She substantiates this on the<br />  paucity of inscriptions which refer to women as both tevar? &shy; <br />iya?<br />  (tevararatiyal) and `palace woman'. </p>
<p>  To my mind, this sort of evidence does nothing to establish the<br />  argument that courtly and temple ritual were unrelated. It is not at<br />  all surprising that temple women would not be affiliated to the<br />  palace, since direct service to two masters in a patriarchal system<br />  could hardly be the norm. Because the servants of one household do <br />not<br />  name themselves as the servants of another can hardly serve as<br />  evidence that these households are run differently. </p>
<p>  Moreover, much other evidence cited by the book would seems to <br />suggest<br />  the contrary, that there was in fact considerable parity between the<br />  practices of the palace and temple ? that the baths, meals, speech <br />and<br />  buildings of both kings and gods are spoken of with the same<br />  vocabulary. The Chola period textual evidence is significant in this<br />  regard, as both architectural texts like Mayamata, as well as the ea<br />  rly pirapantam literature in Tamil, some of which refer to specific<br />  ritual events (like the ul? (ula) or processional description),<br />  clearly envision human and divine lords similarly.</p>
<p>  Equally vexing is the `legal' status of temple women. Orr maintains <br />on<br />  the basis of the `honorific' character of the term a&shy; iy? r <br />(atiyar)<br />  in Tamil bhakti traditions and its use to denote royal `attendants',<br />  that tevara&shy; iy? ? (tevaratiyal) were not in fact `subalterns' <br />or<br />  slaves. She distinguishes these, who formed the demographic majority<br />  of temple women, from those who in the later Chola period clearly<br />  entered into temple service as slaves. While such a distinction may <br />be<br />  plausible, it is vitiated by the lack of any discussion of the<br />  legal/theoretical boundaries of slavery, service, bondage and <br />attendance.</p>
<p>  The inscriptions which record women's donations, often in exchange<br />  for privileges in temple ritual, are for their part ambiguous: they <br />do<br />  not clearly spell out the nature of the relationship which <br />constituted<br />  them as tevara&shy; iy? r (tevaratiyar) in the first place. Orr <br />seems to<br />  believe that such women had no obligation to temples, since none are<br />  mentioned in the inscriptions.</p>
<p>  The fact that temple women were able to make donations raises <br />related<br />  issues as to the relative freedom to accumulate wealth and what the<br />  sources of such wealth may have been. It is not necessary to assume,<br />  as Orr apparently does, that the accumulation of limited amounts of<br />  wealth precluded relations of obligation or servitude. How such <br />wealth<br />  would have been obtained, of course, is unclear, as the inscriptions<br />  are relatively silent on the matter. </p>
<p>  Orr suggests, borrowing from the contemporary studies she is <br />otherwise<br />  keen to distance herself from, that it was gained by performing acts<br />  of worship for patrons. Very plausible, but why should we reject the<br />  same accounts which suggest that sexual favours also formed a source<br />  of income? If the inscriptional record is silent on this matter, <br />what<br />  is the justification for borrowing from the ethnographic evidence in<br />  such a selective manner?</p>
<p>  The `gender' perspective claimed by the book seems to amount to <br />little<br />  more than comparing demographic profiles of men and women in<br />  inscriptions, rather than seeing gender as a set of ideologies and<br />  practices that form subjectivities and agencies. Orr's indifference <br />to<br />  the more `symbolic' or `discursive' elements of gender and dismissal<br />  of textual evidence has sadly handicapped a study which otherwise <br />may<br />  have added something to what most accounts of women in medieval <br />India<br />  are vitally missing. </p>
<p>  It is healthy to use inscriptions as a corrective to the idealising<br />  and unrooted nature of textual analysis, but it is hardly adequate <br />to<br />  ignore such sources altogether. What the inscriptions can tell us is<br />  in many ways as fragmentary as the literary sources. Even more<br />  fundamental is Orr's seeming understanding of `agency' and<br />  disempowerment as mutually exclusive categories, in a sort of<br />  statistical zero-sum game. The overarching theoretical framework of<br />  the book, to demonstrate that women exercised agency, is pursued at<br />  the cost of theorising their oppression. </p>
<p>  Agency is hardly so simple, as most forms of oppression sustain<br />  themselves by actually bestowing certain types of agency to their<br />  victims. This is precisely how ideas of servitude and bhakti in<br />  medieval India functioned at once to `empower' subaltern classes and<br />  compromise their autonomous agency ? making bhakti perennially<br />  availability for both elitist and subaltern agendas. </p>
<p>  The complexity of the temple woman's position, one feels, is missing<br />  from this book.</p>

<p>Book review</p>
<p>Temple Women in Medieval Tamilnadu</p>
<p>Leslie C. Orre</p>
<p>New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. 305 pp.</p>
<p>The figure of the devadasi, or `temple-woman', who entertained Hindu<br />gods at festivals, hardly needs an introduction. Because of her<br />supposed sexual availability, the devadasi became a potent and<br />notorious symbol of the corruption of Hindu society. Together,<br />colonial officials and Indian reformers legislated the devadasi out of<br />existence and sanitized her dance traditions.<br />More recently, scholars have reacted to this legacy by stressing the<br />importance of the devadasi's ritual dance and sexuality in royal and<br />temple ritual. What unites both of these interpretations is their<br />assumption that the devadasi institution as `discovered' during the<br />colonial period reflects an India-wide tradition that stretches back<br />to the early reaches of Indian history.</p>
<p>This book, through an exhaustive and detailed study of medieval<br />inscriptions, effectively challenges the image of the devadasi<br />inherited from modern reform and recent scholarship.</p>
<p>Orr maintains that inscriptions, unlike literary texts and normative<br />representations, reveal the actuality of temple women's lives, as they<br />record specific events involving real people. Orr has examined the<br />entirety of the Chola (c. 950-1250) inscriptional corpus (and a good<br />deal more). The choice justified by the evidence itself, since the<br />Chola records give a more complete profile on `temple women' than<br />north Indian inscriptions, (though other south Indian languages have<br />rich stores of evidence which remain to be tapped).</p>
<p>Orr begins with the problem of terminology, noting that the term<br />devadasi, apparently a Sanskritization of the Tamil word tevara&shy; iy&#140; ? (tevaratiyal) (, was neither ubiquitous nor even widespread in<br />medieval inscriptions, but only gained currency in the last century.<br />In pre-colonial times, the historian encounters a plethora of terms<br />which vary across region, language and period. </p>
<p>In the second chapter, Orr concludes on the basis of her survey of the<br />Chola materials that rather than the modern figure of the devadasi,<br />the inscriptions suggest a more general category of `temple women'.<br />The overlapping of terms like tevara&shy; iy&#140; ? (tevaratiyal), teva? &#140; r<br />maka? (tevanar makal) , patiyil&#140; r (patiyilar), and ta? iyil&#140; r<br />(taliyilar) , along with the mention of functions, privileges and<br />specific associations with temples, indicate, according to Orr, the<br />category of `temple woman' as a coherent social identity.</p>
<p>The author compares temple women to other types of women found in<br />inscriptions, most notably palace women. Orr argues, against the<br />conclusions of other scholars, that during the Chola period there was<br />no close relationship between court and temple. An enquiry into the<br />Tamil terms for temple woman, is equally corrective, according to Orr.<br />The term a&shy; iy&#140; r (atiyar), often translated as `slave' or `servant',<br />probably instead indicated the idea of a `retainer' for a king. It<br />also carried with it honorific connotations rooted in the south Indian<br />religious ethos of devotion. In comparison with terms from other parts<br />of India referring to temple women, which often meant slave or<br />prostitute, Orr finds that the Tamil terms are more honorific and<br />devotional in meaning.</p>
<p>Temple women appear most frequently in inscriptions as `donors',<br />making gifts of various kinds to the temples themselves, and the third<br />chapter of the book analyses this aspect of the evidence. Compared to<br />other women and men associated with temples, temple women appear as<br />donors in increasing numbers throughout the course of the Chola<br />period, and as time passed, were increasingly implicated in the life<br />of numerous temples throughout Tamilnadu as a consequence of their<br />donations.</p>
<p>Their appearance as donors leads to the question of their possession<br />of property and wealth. According to the dharma? &#140; stras (dharm a<br />sastras), Orr points out, a woman's access to wealth was generally<br />mediated through her husband. But as Chola temple women remained<br />unmarried, it seems, the question of where these women accumulated the<br />wealth to make gifts to temples is both relevant, and given the<br />author's wish to avoid the sacred prostitution theory, a crucial one.<br />Orr speculates that their wealth came from gifts by natal families or<br />inheritances from their mother as well as worship service performed on<br />behalf of other temple patrons.</p>
<p>Whatever their source of wealth, the conclusion is that in relation<br />to married women, temple women seemed to enjoy increasing economic<br />power and prosperity through the Chola period due to their<br />relationships with temples.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth chapters focus, respectively, on the work of<br />temple women and their identity with respect to geography, religion<br />and kinship. In contrast to their male counterparts, the role of women<br />in temple ritual, it would seem, was often incidental and optional.<br />They were neither ritual `specialists' nor a ritual `necessity' for<br />the temple as some scholarship has recently maintained.</p>
<p>They were most certainly not associated primarily with dance. Of the<br />304 Chola inscriptions that mention temple women, only four, according<br />to Orr, use terms that refer to `dancer'. More important was their<br />role in menial work (cleaning pots and pans, washing floors), and<br />performance of attendance functions like flywhisk bearing and dancing.<br />Women's role in both of these occupations, one debased and the other<br />exalted, increased throughout the Chola period. </p>
<p>Women in many cases received honoured status in temple ritual as a<br />result of their donations, but in some (about half of the references<br />that mention temple service) they seemed to received minimal living<br />`stipends', which may have indicated that they entered temple service<br />under conditions not of their own making.</p>
<p>For most women, concludes Orr, temple service was not a source of<br />livelihood, (excepting `slaves' acquired by the temple to perform<br />menial services), but was a way `to enhance status that was already<br />theirs' (134). </p>
<p>Temple women, geographically spread throughout the Chola realm, show<br />strong identification in the early Chola periods with deities of<br />particular places, but as time wore on, are increasingly referred to<br />in relation to particular temples, reflecting a general trend to a<br />more temple-based authority structure in the post-Chola period.<br />Women's temple service, according to Orr, was not in most cases<br />hereditary, reflecting what she claims to be a general social fluidity<br />during Chola times.</p>
<p>The book places the history of temple women within the context of<br />temples emerging as the dominant centres of economic and political<br />power as the Chola state declined. While such arguments are<br />tantalising, they remain somewhat fragmentary, and the chief thrust of<br />the book remains its engagement with the image of the devadasi<br />inherited by the debates, reforms and studies of the last century. By<br />its end, this image of the devadasi &#151; as sexually exploited temple<br />dancer/prostitute or the embodiment of sacred feminine power &#151; can<br />hardly be sustained in any simple or unqualified way. </p>
<p>In the final section of the conclusion, the author attempts to trace<br />briefly how the institution encountered in the 19th century by<br />colonial officials had evolved from the Chola period. She sees the<br />post-Chola, Vijayanagar, and Nayak periods as bringing a steady<br />decline in the power of women. An increase in feminine symbolism and<br />goddess imagery was accompanied by a decline in the `public'<br />representation of women and decreasing agency in political economic<br />and religious spheres. Hence the modern devadasi.</p>
<p>The alternative image of the temple woman that Orr draws for the Chola<br />period, however, raises many questions. That the turn to inscriptions<br />can illuminate the lives of women in medieval India is surely proved<br />beyond doubt by this book. </p>
<p>The book also demonstrates, however, the limitations of an<br />over-reliance on inscriptions to the detriment of other sorts of<br />evidence, and perhaps more importantly, a coherent social/theoretical<br />framework. Inscriptions, as the author points out, record only certain<br />types of events, revealing fragments rather than an entire picture.<br />Their interpretation is not so straightforward.</p>
<p>If the copious inscriptions recovered from the Chola period have<br />supported at least three models of the south Indian state, they are<br />certainly capable of revealing several different images of the devadasi.</p>
<p>At a general level, Orr claims that in the Chola period there was no<br />intimate sharing of ritual forms, dance, music, and personnel between<br />the domains of the temple and court. She substantiates this on the<br />paucity of inscriptions which refer to women as both tevar&#140; &shy; iya? (tevararatiyal) and `palace woman'. </p>
<p>To my mind, this sort of evidence does nothing to establish the<br />argument that courtly and temple ritual were unrelated. It is not at<br />all surprising that temple women would not be affiliated to the<br />palace, since direct service to two masters in a patriarchal system<br />could hardly be the norm. Because the servants of one household do not<br />name themselves as the servants of another can hardly serve as<br />evidence that these households are run differently. </p>
<p>Moreover, much other evidence cited by the book would seems to suggest<br />the contrary, that there was in fact considerable parity between the<br />practices of the palace and temple &#151; that the baths, meals, speech and<br />buildings of both kings and gods are spoken of with the same<br />vocabulary. The Chola period textual evidence is significant in this<br />regard, as both architectural texts like Mayamata, as well as the ea<br />rly pirapantam literature in Tamil, some of which refer to specific<br />ritual events (like the ul&#140; (ula) or processional description),<br />clearly envision human and divine lords similarly.</p>
<p>Equally vexing is the `legal' status of temple women. Orr maintains on<br />the basis of the `honorific' character of the term a&shy; iy&#140; r (atiyar)<br />in Tamil bhakti traditions and its use to denote royal `attendants',<br />that tevara&shy; iy&#140; ? (tevaratiyal) were not in fact `subalterns' or<br />slaves. She distinguishes these, who formed the demographic majority<br />of temple women, from those who in the later Chola period clearly<br />entered into temple service as slaves. While such a distinction may be<br />plausible, it is vitiated by the lack of any discussion of the<br />legal/theoretical boundaries of slavery, service, bondage and attendance.</p>
<p>The inscriptions which record women's donations, often in exchange<br />for privileges in temple ritual, are for their part ambiguous: they do<br />not clearly spell out the nature of the relationship which constituted<br />them as tevara&shy; iy&#140; r (tevaratiyar) in the first place. Orr seems to<br />believe that such women had no obligation to temples, since none are<br />mentioned in the inscriptions.</p>
<p>The fact that temple women were able to make donations raises related<br />issues as to the relative freedom to accumulate wealth and what the<br />sources of such wealth may have been. It is not necessary to assume,<br />as Orr apparently does, that the accumulation of limited amounts of<br />wealth precluded relations of obligation or servitude. How such wealth<br />would have been obtained, of course, is unclear, as the inscriptions<br />are relatively silent on the matter. </p>
<p>Orr suggests, borrowing from the contemporary studies she is otherwise<br />keen to distance herself from, that it was gained by performing acts<br />of worship for patrons. Very plausible, but why should we reject the<br />same accounts which suggest that sexual favours also formed a source<br />of income? If the inscriptional record is silent on this matter, what<br />is the justification for borrowing from the ethnographic evidence in<br />such a selective manner?</p>
<p>The `gender' perspective claimed by the book seems to amount to little<br />more than comparing demographic profiles of men and women in<br />inscriptions, rather than seeing gender as a set of ideologies and<br />practices that form subjectivities and agencies. Orr's indifference to<br />the more `symbolic' or `discursive' elements of gender and dismissal<br />of textual evidence has sadly handicapped a study which otherwise may<br />have added something to what most accounts of women in medieval India<br />are vitally missing. </p>
<p>It is healthy to use inscriptions as a corrective to the idealising<br />and unrooted nature of textual analysis, but it is hardly adequate to<br />ignore such sources altogether. What the inscriptions can tell us is<br />in many ways as fragmentary as the literary sources. Even more<br />fundamental is Orr's seeming understanding of `agency' and<br />disempowerment as mutually exclusive categories, in a sort of<br />statistical zero-sum game. The overarching theoretical framework of<br />the book, to demonstrate that women exercised agency, is pursued at<br />the cost of theorising their oppression. </p>
<p>Agency is hardly so simple, as most forms of oppression sustain<br />themselves by actually bestowing certain types of agency to their<br />victims. This is precisely how ideas of servitude and bhakti in<br />medieval India functioned at once to `empower' subaltern classes and<br />compromise their autonomous agency &#151; making bhakti perennially<br />availability for both elitist and subaltern agendas. </p>
<p>The complexity of the temple woman's position, one feels, is missing<br />from this book.</p>
