<p>Hi,<br />This is Jayachandran. <br />I wish to share some information about Manmata and his attributes.<br />They are traditionally called as MANMATA SAINYAs, the retinue of Manmata.<br />  <br />His wives are – Rati (lust), Preeti (love), and his two othjer lesser known wives Shakti (power) and Ujjwala (brightness) <br />His brothers are – Sama (peace), Harsha (happiness) <br />His sakha is – Vasanata Kaala (spring) <br />His bow is of – sugarcane <br />The bow’s string is of bumble bees <br />His flag – is of makara, or fish (FILM SONG : Meen kodi theril) <br />The radiant moon becomes his umbrella <br />His vaahana is of Hamsa or Swan. <br />His army is composed of  - Cavalry of Parrots - the elephant of darkness - the infantry of young women <br />His Chariot – is the breeze <br />His sword – tender mango leaves <br />His war drums are  the sea waves <br />Peacocks are his troupe of actors <br />Cuckoos are his messengers </p>
<p> <br />Manmata is addresed in different names. The several names of Manmata and the context is as mentioned below:<br />Madana – the intoxicator, <br />Manmata – the churner of the mind, <br />Mara – the destroyer, <br />Manoja, Bhavaja – born from the mind, <br />Srinandana – son of lakshmi, <br />Kanchana – golden in colour, <br />Ananga – bodiless, <br />Abhiroopa – the beautiful <br />Darpaka – the inflamer <br />Kandarpa – the inflamer of Brahma <br />Kalakeli – causing sexual desire <br />Madhudipa – the lamp of honey <br />Samantaka – destroyer of peace <br />Samsaraguru – teacher of the wordly pleasure <br />Smara – remembrance <br />Sringarayoni – Source of love. <br />  <br />While Manmata is often sported with five blossoms or PANCHA BAANA, through which he inflicts love. These flowers are not shot at different part of thebody to invoke different feeling within the Lovers: <br />Arrow 1: Aravindam or Lotus  - is shot by Kaama  at the HEART andit causes  Unmaadana (excitement) <br />  <br />Arrow 2: Ashokam  or Ashoka blossoms  – is shot by Darpaka at the LIPS and it causes Tapana (heat) <br />  <br />Arrow 3: Chootam or Mango blossoms – is shot by Kandarpa targeted at the MIND and causes Soshana (drying up) <br />  <br />Arrow 4: Navamallika or Jasmine – is shot by Madana targeted at theEYES and causes Sthambana (arrest of normal function) <br />  <br />Arrow 5: Neelotpalam or Blue lily – is shot by Maara at the unknownpart of the body and causes Sammohana (infatuation) </p>
<p> <br />Thank you<br />S.Jayachandran</p>

<p>Rathi and her companion Manmatha are normally considered very light beings - if you were to draw a parellel to english myth - fairies and elves - theyare otherwise called 'kinnaraas' also. A volumptious Rathi is extremely unusual and not at all the way she is described. Perhaps the sculptor just meant a celestial being on a peacock, not exactly Rathi.</p>

<p>    Hi Vijay and Shobha,</p>
<p>    It is rathi for sure. Quoting Swaminathan sir's words on what features describe Rathi..."No more than peacock. All these are Nayak work, and they make Rathi more voluptuous than other female figures which are all voluptuous any way."</p>
<p>  hi ragothaman</p>
<p>  Volutuous... .I might be a bit biased to pallava sculpture but talking ofgrace of fluid form there are no parallels to them, but as far as defined godly forms the chola craftsmen excelled. Coming to nayak though their workwas volumnous and highly intricate ( sometimes over did, I would say similar issues of over ornamentation in chalukya sculptures) they don't quite leave you spell bound. <br />  Rgds<br />  Vj</p>

<p>  At CERN, the world's largest and most complex scientific=20=20<br />  instruments are used to study the basic constituents of matter =E2=80=94 =<br />=20<br />  the fundamental particles. By studying what happens when these=20=20<br />  particles collide, physicists learn about the laws of Nature. CERN=20=20<br />  established a two metre high statue of Nataraj, the dancing form of=20=20<br />  Shiva with an open third eye at their headquarters in Geneva. A=20=20<br />  special plaque next to the Shiva statue explains the significance=20=20<br />  of the metaphor of Shiva's cosmic dance with several quotations=20=20<br />  from The Tao of Physics . Here is the text of the plaque:</p>
<p>  "Modern physics has shown that the rhythm of creation and=20=20<br />  destruction is not only manifest in the turn of the seasons and in=20=20<br />  the birth and death of all living creatures, but is also the very=20=20<br />  essence of inorganic matter,for the modern physicists, then,=20=20<br />  Shiva's dance is the dance of subatomic matter.Hundreds of years=20=20<br />  ago, Indian artists created visual images of dancing Shiva in a=20=20<br />  beautiful series of bronzes. In our time, physicists have used the=20=20<br />  most advanced technology to portray the patterns of the cosmic=20=20<br />  dance. The metaphor of the cosmic dance thus unifies ancient=20=20<br />  mythology, religious art and modern physics."</p>

<p>  Hi,<br />  This is Jayachandran. <br />  I wish to share some information about Manmata and his attributes.<br />  They are traditionally called as MANMATA SAINYAs, the retinue of Manmata.<br />    <br />  His wives are ??" Rati (lust), Preeti (love), and his two othjer lesser known wives Shakti (power) and Ujjwala (brightness) <br />  His brothers are ??" Sama (peace), Harsha (happiness) <br />  His sakha is ??" Vasanata Kaala (spring) <br />  His bow is of ??" sugarcane <br />  The bow’s string is of bumble bees <br />  His flag ??" is of makara, or fish (FILM SONG : Meen kodi theril) <br />  The radiant moon becomes his umbrella <br />  His vaahana is of Hamsa or Swan. <br />  His army is composed of  - Cavalry of Parrots - the elephant of darkness - the infantry of young women <br />  His Chariot ??" is the breeze <br />  His sword ??" tender mango leaves <br />  His war drums are  the sea waves <br />  Peacocks are his troupe of actors <br />  Cuckoos are his messengers </p>
<p>   <br />  Manmata is addresed in different names. The several names of Manmataand the context is as mentioned below:<br />  Madana ??" the intoxicator, <br />  Manmata ??" the churner of the mind, <br />  Mara ??" the destroyer, <br />  Manoja, Bhavaja ??" born from the mind, <br />  Srinandana ??" son of lakshmi, <br />  Kanchana ??" golden in colour, <br />  Ananga ??" bodiless, <br />  Abhiroopa ??" the beautiful <br />  Darpaka ??" the inflamer <br />  Kandarpa ??" the inflamer of Brahma <br />  Kalakeli ??" causing sexual desire <br />  Madhudipa ??" the lamp of honey <br />  Samantaka ??" destroyer of peace <br />  Samsaraguru ??" teacher of the wordly pleasure <br />  Smara ??" remembrance <br />  Sringarayoni ??" Source of love. <br />    <br />  While Manmata is often sported with five blossoms or PANCHA BAANA, through which he inflicts love. These flowers are not shot at different part of the body to invoke different feeling within the Lovers: <br />  Arrow 1: Aravindam or Lotus  - is shot by Kaama  at the HEART and it causes  Unmaadana (excitement) <br />    <br />  Arrow 2: Ashokam  or Ashoka blossoms  ??" is shot by Darpaka at the LIPS and it causes Tapana (heat) <br />    <br />  Arrow 3: Chootam or Mango blossoms ??" is shot by Kandarpa targeted at the MIND and causes Soshana (drying up) <br />    <br />  Arrow 4: Navamallika or Jasmine ??" is shot by Madana targeted at theEYES and causes Sthambana (arrest of normal function) <br />    <br />  Arrow 5: Neelotpalam or Blue lily ??" is shot by Maara at the unknownpart of the body and causes Sammohana (infatuation) </p>

<p>  Rathi and her companion Manmatha are normally considered very light beings - if you were to draw a parellel to english myth - fairies and elves - they are otherwise called 'kinnaraas' also. A volumptious Rathi is extremely unusual and not at all the way she is described. Perhaps the sculptor just meant a celestial being on a peacock, not exactly Rathi.</p>

<p>      Hi Vijay and Shobha,</p>
<p>      It is rathi for sure. Quoting Swaminathan sir's words on what features describe Rathi..."No more than peacock. All these are Nayak work, and they make Rathi more voluptuous than other female figures which are all voluptuous any way."</p>
<p>    hi ragothaman</p>
<p>    Volutuous... .I might be a bit biased to pallava sculpture but talking of grace of fluid form there are no parallels to them, but as far as defined godly forms the chola craftsmen excelled. Coming to nayak though their work was volumnous and highly intricate ( sometimes over did, I would say similar issues of over ornamentation in chalukya sculptures) they don't quite leave you spell bound. <br />    Rgds<br />    Vj</p>

<p>  At CERN, the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments are used to study the basic constituents of matter ? the fundamental particles. By studying what happens when these particles collide, physicists learn about the laws of Nature. CERN established a two metre high statue of Nataraj, the dancing form of Shiva with an open third eye at their headquarters in Geneva. A special plaque next to the Shiva statue explains the significance of the metaphor of Shiva's cosmic dance with several quotations from The Tao of Physics . Here is the text of the plaque:</p>
<p>  "Modern physics has shown that the rhythm of creation and destruction is not only manifest in the turn of the seasons and in the birth and death of all living creatures, but is also the very essence of inorganic matter,for the modern physicists, then, Shiva's dance is the dance of subatomic matter.Hundreds of years ago, Indian artists created visual images of dancing Shiva in a beautiful series of bronzes. In our time, physicists have used the most advanced technology to portray the patterns of the cosmic dance. The metaphor of the cosmic dance thus unifies ancient mythology, religious art and modern physics." </p>

<p>            Hi Jeyachandran, could you post the origins of the story -  <br />        which purana/epic it was stated. I am guessing Srimad Bhagavadam  <br />        but would you know which chapter?</p>
<p>            Manmatha is regarded as Sri Krishna's son with Rukmini, per  <br />        Srimad Bhagavadham. Rati, his wife is the daughter of Daksha the  <br />        king of himalayas.</p>
<p>            The Kannada poet Kanakadasa wrote a poetry text called  <br />        MohanaTarangini based on Manmatha's stories in Bhagavadam and  <br />        Mahabharat.It is similar to Jayadeva's Gita Govindam.</p>
<p>            Kalidasa in Meghasandesham also refers to Manmatha with arrow  <br />        with mango blossoms and bow of bees.</p>
<p>            Arangalur near Salem is supposedly where Manmadha was burned to  <br />        ashes by Lord Shiva.</p>

<p>              do we have so many details of manmatha because he is a  <br />        frequent charecter in ancient classics, or do we know so much about  <br />        other minor gods too?</p>

<p>one more thanks to the CERN for changing our lives<br />as the invetors of the internet.</p>
<p>from the wiki</p>
<p>The World Wide Web began as a CERN project called ENQUIRE, initiated by SirTim Berners-Lee in 1989 and Robert Cailliau in 1990 [3]. Berners-Lee and Cailliau were jointly honored by the ACM in 1995 for their contributions to the development of the World Wide Web.<br />Based on the concept of hypertext, the project was aimed at facilitating sharing information among researchers. The first website went on-line in 1991. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free toanyone. A copy of the original first webpage, created by Berners-Lee, is still published on the World Wide Web Consortium website as a historical document.</p></dmaloo@...></p>

        <p>Shiva's third eye has inspired millions around the globe since ages, Adobe being the latest one. Before that, CERN was inspired by it. Its the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as a highly respected centre fornuclear research focusing primarily on fundamental physics, finding out what the universe is made of and how it works. </p>
<p>At CERN, the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments are used to study the basic constituents of matter ? the fundamental particles.By studying what happens when these particles collide, physicists learn about the laws of Nature. CERN established a two metre high statue of Nataraj, the dancing form of Shiva with an open third eye at their headquarters inGeneva. A special plaque next to the Shiva statue explains the significance of the metaphor of Shiva's cosmic dance with several quotations from The Tao of Physics . Here is the text of the plaque:</p>
<p>"Modern physics has shown that the rhythm of creation and destruction is not only manifest in the turn of the seasons and in the birth and death of all living creatures, but is also the very essence of inorganic matter,for the modern physicists, then, Shiva's dance is the dance of subatomic matter.Hundreds of years ago, Indian artists created visual images of dancing Shivain a beautiful series of bronzes. In our time, physicists have used the most advanced technology to portray the patterns of the cosmic dance. The metaphor of the cosmic dance thus unifies ancient mythology, religious art andmodern physics." </p>

<p>          Hi Jeyachandran, could you post the origins of the story -  <br />      which purana/epic it was stated. I am guessing Srimad Bhagavadam  <br />      but would you know which chapter?</p>
<p>          Manmatha is regarded as Sri Krishna's son with Rukmini, per  <br />      Srimad Bhagavadham. Rati, his wife is the daughter of Daksha the  <br />      king of himalayas.</p>
<p>          The Kannada poet Kanakadasa wrote a poetry text called  <br />      MohanaTarangini based on Manmatha's stories in Bhagavadam and  <br />      Mahabharat.It is similar to Jayadeva's Gita Govindam.</p>
<p>          Kalidasa in Meghasandesham also refers to Manmatha with arrow  <br />      with mango blossoms and bow of bees.</p>
<p>          Arangalur near Salem is supposedly where Manmadha was burned to  <br />      ashes by Lord Shiva.</p>

<p>            do we have so many details of manmatha because he is a  <br />      frequent charecter in ancient classics, or do we know so much about  <br />      other minor gods too?</p>

        <p>Actually another version of the same story has it that Siva granted Rathi aboon that her husband would be visible to her eyes only. <br />Which seems more believable as Manmatha is regarded as invisible and is present in almost every myth and legend imaginable.</p>

        <p>Kathie, all of these stories have deeper spiritual undertones.</p>
<p>The ego in us is the Manmatha, "the agitator of the mind," and that has to be turned into ashes through the impact of divine<br />vision. The divine, the Easwara, will not yield Himself to physical charm, worldly authority, muscular or intellectual <br />or financial power. This is the inner meaning of the Manmatha episode.Parvathi underwent extreme austerities and <br />subjected herself (that is to say, her ego-consciousness) to sun and rain, cold and hunger, and thus transformed herself. <br />Finally,Easwara (Siva) accepted her as half of Himself. </p>

<p>        Hi Jeyachandran, could you post the origins of the story -  <br />    which purana/epic it was stated. I am guessing Srimad Bhagavadam  <br />    but would you know which chapter?</p>
<p>        Manmatha is regarded as Sri Krishna's son with Rukmini, per  <br />    Srimad Bhagavadham. Rati, his wife is the daughter of Daksha the  <br />    king of himalayas.</p>
<p>        The Kannada poet Kanakadasa wrote a poetry text called  <br />    MohanaTarangini based on Manmatha's stories in Bhagavadam and  <br />    Mahabharat.It is similar to Jayadeva's Gita Govindam.</p>
<p>        Kalidasa in Meghasandesham also refers to Manmatha with arrow  <br />    with mango blossoms and bow of bees.</p>
<p>        Arangalur near Salem is supposedly where Manmadha was burned to  <br />    ashes by Lord Shiva.</p>

<p>Venkat, quite possible, there are lot of multiple temples associated with thala puraanams. And yes you are right Pradyumna was considered Manmatha reborn.</p>

<p>  Hi</p>
<p>  what about thirukurukkai one of the 8 Veeratta Stalams </p>
<p>  Tirukkurukkai is associated here with the destruction of Manmathan by Shiva.. Various towns around here bear names of incidents connected with Manmathan's tryst with Shiva. Eg. Kaalvalaimedu, Kanganamputhur, Vedanallur, Villiyanallur. </p>
<p>  Tirukkurukkai is located 8 km northwest of Mayiladuturai and is considered to be the 26th in the series of the Tevara Stalams located in Chola Nadu north of the river Kaveri.</p>

<p>      Hi Jeyachandran, could you post the origins of the story - <br />  which purana/epic it was stated. I am guessing Srimad Bhagavadam <br />  but would you know which chapter?</p>
<p>      Manmatha is regarded as Sri Krishna's son with Rukmini, per <br />  Srimad Bhagavadham. Rati, his wife is the daughter of Daksha the <br />  king of himalayas.</p>
<p>      The Kannada poet Kanakadasa wrote a poetry text called <br />  MohanaTarangini based on Manmatha's stories in Bhagavadam and <br />  Mahabharat.It is similar to Jayadeva's Gita Govindam.</p>
<p>      Kalidasa in Meghasandesham also refers to Manmatha with arrow <br />  with mango blossoms and bow of bees.</p>
<p>      Arangalur near Salem is supposedly where Manmadha was burned to <br />  ashes by Lord Shiva.</p>

<p>        do we have so many details of manmatha because he is a <br />  frequent charecter in ancient classics, or do we know so much about <br />  other minor gods too?</p>

<p>  what about thirukurukkai one of the 8 Veeratta Stalams   </p>
<p>  Tirukkurukkai is associated here with the destruction of Manmathan by Shiva.. Various towns around here bear names of incidents connected with Manmathan's tryst with Shiva. Eg. Kaalvalaimedu, Kanganamputhur, Vedanallur, Villiyanallur. </p>
<p>  Tirukkurukkai is located 8 km northwest of Mayiladuturai and is considered to be the 26th in the series of the Tevara Stalams located in Chola Nadu north of the river Kaveri.</p>

<p>Hi</p></blockquote>
<p>what about thirukurukkai one of the 8 Veeratta Stalams   </p>
<p>Tirukkurukkai is associated here with the destruction of Manmathan by Shiva.. Various towns around here bear names of incidents connected with Manmathan's tryst with Shiva. Eg. Kaalvalaimedu, Kanganamputhur, Vedanallur, Villiyanallur. </p>
<p>Tirukkurukkai is located 8 km northwest of Mayiladuturai and is considered to be the 26th in the series of the Tevara Stalams located in Chola Nadu north of the river Kaveri.</p>

<p>    Hi Jeyachandran, could you post the origins of the story - which purana/epic it was stated. I am guessing Srimad Bhagavadam but would you know which chapter?</p>
<p>    Manmatha is regarded as Sri Krishna's son with Rukmini, per Srimad Bhagavadham. Rati, his wife is the daughter of Daksha the king of himalayas.</p>
<p>    The Kannada poet Kanakadasa wrote a poetry text called MohanaTarangini based on Manmatha's stories in Bhagavadam and Mahabharat.It is similar to Jayadeva's Gita Govindam.</p>
<p>    Kalidasa in Meghasandesham also refers to Manmatha with arrow with mango blossoms and bow of bees.</p>
<p>    Arangalur near Salem is supposedly where Manmadha was burned to ashes by Lord Shiva.</p>

<p>      do we have so many details of manmatha because he is a frequent charecter in ancient classics, or do we know so much about other minor gods too?</p>

<p>Hi Jeyachandran, could you post the origins of the story - which purana/epic it was stated. I am guessing Srimad Bhagavadam but would you know which chapter?</p>
<p>Manmatha is regarded as Sri Krishna's son with Rukmini, per Srimad Bhagavadham. Rati, his wife is the daughter of Daksha the king of himalayas.</p>
<p>The Kannada poet Kanakadasa wrote a poetry text called MohanaTarangini based on Manmatha's stories in Bhagavadam and Mahabharat.It is similar to Jayadeva's Gita Govindam.</p>
<p>Kalidasa in Meghasandesham also refers to Manmatha with arrow with mango blossoms and bow of bees.</p>
<p>Arangalur near Salem is supposedly where Manmadha was burned to ashes by Lord Shiva.</p>

        <p>Dear SPS,<br />Thank you for the link.<br />The?term like 'APSARA' literally means 'born from water'. <br />Given the characteristics of a APASARAs that is:<br />who?are very?delicate<br />who are almost invisible<br />who raise towards the heaven in the mornings<br />who descend back to earth in the nights to play<br />who dance in the courts of INDRA (the lord of the sky)?<br />One almost wonders whether we are speaking about the 'water-cycle'. Are APSARAS are symbolic representatives of water-vapour-clouds-rainfall??according to Srimad Bhagavatam 'SRI' or 'LAKSHMI' was born out of the milky oceanafter the apsaras were born. Lakshmi has much to do with water, prosperityand life force. <br />One of the interpretation of?Gaja-lakshmi symbology is that, elephants besides Lakshmi are symbolised?to represent?clouds. When the elephants (clouds) pour water (rainfall), the symbol of auspiciousness (mangalam) Lotus?is born and on top of it sits the embodiment of prosperity (tiru, lakshmi, sri). As a whole Gaja-Lakshmi stands for properity (Sritvam)<br />Feminity, prosperity, nakedness, sensousness, progeny?and water are synonymous in symbology and one faculty can easily slip into the other to mean the same. <br />Regards<br />S.Jayachandran</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Venkatesh,<br />You are right that we are speaking about Saraca Indica whenever we are refering to Ashoka blossoms. It is pretty interesting to know that Kalidasa in his Ritusamhara describes about these blossoms in different occassions which causes love and seperation.<br />In Ritusamhara there is mention of the blooming of lotus (Nelumbo Nucifera) when hugged by the chest of the maidens, blossoming of Ashokam (Saraca Indica) when the maidens kiss the flower, blossoming of Chootam (Mangifera Indica) when the maidens think of there lovers and so on. (there are many references in Kumarasambhavam also).<br />Scholars like Dr.Kapila Vatsyayan has quoted that Ashoka blossoms were applied as a paste by the love lorne heroines to overcome the pains of seperations (may be references to Pasalai noi as mentioned in our Litt)<br /> <br />Dear Swaroopini Balachandran, <br />As asked the term DESTROYER is associated with MAARA for the reason that the symbol of MARA was earlier associated with a destructive force. One should get remined of the dialogue between GAUTAMA and MAARA (the destroyer- dark skinned yaksha with a stealthy feeling to divert GAUTAMA and destroy his wish and peace), before GAUTAMA entered PARINIRVANA and became GAUTAMA, theBUDDHA. Hence MAARA is called as destroyer (of peace too).<br />It is also true that KAAMA was also associated with creation. The cult of KAAMA poses a good example how the prototype of KAAMA appraises himself in the divine pantheon to be called as god of creation and destruction. It is true that Kaama was associated with mind, the mind of the parabrahma on whose state of mind (remember MANOJA, other name of Kaama which means bornout of mind ) creation and destruction was carried on. This pushes the date of KAAMA motif very early and HE sound very similar to EROS as in Greek mythology who has a similar role to do with MIND, LOVE, CREATION and DESTRUCTION.<br />Regards<br />S.Jayachandran</p>

<p>Hi,<br />This is Jayachandran. <br />I wish to share some information about Manmata and his attributes.<br />They are traditionally called as MANMATA SAINYAs, the retinue of Manmata.<br />  <br />His wives are – Rati (lust), Preeti (love), and his two othjer lesser known wives Shakti (power) and Ujjwala (brightness) <br />His brothers are – Sama (peace), Harsha (happiness) <br />His sakha is – Vasanata Kaala (spring) <br />His bow is of – sugarcane <br />The bow’s string is of bumble bees <br />His flag – is of makara, or fish (FILM SONG : Meen kodi theril) <br />The radiant moon becomes his umbrella <br />His vaahana is of Hamsa or Swan. <br />His army is composed of  - Cavalry of Parrots - the elephant of darkness - the infantry of young women <br />His Chariot – is the breeze <br />His sword – tender mango leaves <br />His war drums are  the sea waves <br />Peacocks are his troupe of actors <br />Cuckoos are his messengers </p>
<p> <br />Manmata is addresed in different names. The several names of Manmata and the context is as mentioned below:<br />Madana – the intoxicator, </p>
<p>Manmata – the churner of the mind, <br />Mara – the destroyer, <br />Manoja, Bhavaja – born from the mind, <br />Srinandana – son of lakshmi, <br />Kanchana – golden in colour, <br />Ananga – bodiless, <br />Abhiroopa – the beautiful <br />Darpaka – the inflamer <br />Kandarpa – the inflamer of Brahma <br />Kalakeli – causing sexual desire <br />Madhudipa – the lamp of honey <br />Samantaka – destroyer of peace <br />Samsaraguru – teacher of the wordly pleasure <br />Smara – remembrance <br />Sringarayoni – Source of love. <br />  <br />While Manmata is often sported with five blossoms or PANCHA BAANA, through which he inflicts love. These flowers are not shot at different part of thebody to invoke different feeling within the Lovers: <br />Arrow 1: Aravindam or Lotus  - is shot by Kaama  at the HEART andit causes  Unmaadana (excitement) <br />  <br />Arrow 2: Ashokam  or Ashoka blossoms  – is shot by Darpaka at the LIPS and it causes Tapana (heat) <br />  <br />Arrow 3: Chootam or Mango blossoms – is shot by Kandarpa targeted at the MIND and causes Soshana (drying up) <br />  <br />Arrow 4: Navamallika or Jasmine – is shot by Madana targeted at theEYES and causes Sthambana (arrest of normal function) <br />  <br />Arrow 5: Neelotpalam or Blue lily – is shot by Maara at the unknownpart of the body and causes Sammohana (infatuation) </p>

<p>Rathi and her companion Manmatha are normally considered very light beings - if you were to draw a parellel to english myth - fairies and elves - theyare otherwise called 'kinnaraas' also. A volumptious Rathi is extremely unusual and not at all the way she is described. Perhaps the sculptor just meant a celestial being on a peacock, not exactly Rathi.</p>

<p>  Hi,<br />  This is Jayachandran.<br />  I wish to share some information about Manmata and his attributes.<br />  They are traditionally called as MANMATA SAINYAs, the retinue of Manmata.</p>
<p>  His wives are ? Rati (lust), Preeti (love), and his two othjer lesser known<br />  wives Shakti (power) and Ujjwala (brightness)</p>
<p>  His brothers are ? Sama (peace), Harsha (happiness)</p>
<p>  His sakha is ? Vasanata Kaala (spring)</p>
<p>  His bow is of ? sugarcane</p>
<p>  The bow?s string is of bumble bees</p>
<p>  His flag ? is of makara, or fish *(FILM SONG : Meen kodi theril)*</p>
<p>  The radiant moon becomes his umbrella</p>
<p>  His vaahana is of Hamsa or Swan.</p>
<p>  His army is composed of - Cavalry of Parrots - the elephant of darkness -<br />  the infantry of young women</p>
<p>  His Chariot ? is the breeze</p>
<p>  His sword ? tender mango leaves</p>
<p>  His war drums are the sea waves</p>
<p>  Peacocks are his troupe of actors</p>
<p>  Cuckoos are his messengers<br />  Manmata is addresed in different names. The several names of Manmata and<br />  the context is as mentioned below:</p>
<p>  Madana ? the intoxicator,</p>
<p>  Manmata ? the churner of the mind,</p>
<p>  Mara ? the destroyer,</p>
<p>  Manoja, Bhavaja ? born from the mind,</p>
<p>  Srinandana ? son of lakshmi,</p>
<p>  Kanchana ? golden in colour,</p>
<p>  Ananga ? bodiless,</p>
<p>  Abhiroopa ? the beautiful</p>
<p>  Darpaka ? the inflamer</p>
<p>  Kandarpa ? the inflamer of Brahma</p>
<p>  Kalakeli ? causing sexual desire</p>
<p>  Madhudipa ? the lamp of honey</p>
<p>  Samantaka ? destroyer of peace</p>
<p>  Samsaraguru ? teacher of the wordly pleasure</p>
<p>  Smara ? remembrance</p>
<p>  Sringarayoni ? Source of love.</p>
<p>  While Manmata is often sported with five blossoms or PANCHA BAANA, through<br />  which he inflicts love. These flowers are not shot at different part of the<br />  body to invoke different feeling within the Lovers:</p>
<p>  *Arrow 1: Aravindam or Lotus* - is shot by *Kaama * at the *HEART* and it<br />  causes *Unmaadana (excitement)*</p>
<p>  * *</p>
<p>  *Arrow 2: Ashokam or Ashoka blossoms* ? is shot by *Darpaka* at the *<br />  LIPS* and it causes *Tapana (heat)*</p>
<p>  * *</p>
<p>  *Arrow 3: Chootam or Mango blossoms* ? is shot by *Kandarpa* targeted at<br />  the *MIND* and causes *Soshana (drying up)*</p>
<p>  *Arrow 4: Navamallika or Jasmine* ? is shot by *Madana* targeted at the*<br />  EYES* and causes *Sthambana (arrest of normal function)*</p>
<p>  * *</p>
<p>  *Arrow 5: Neelotpalam or Blue lily* ? is shot by *Maara *at the *unknown<br />  part of the body* and causes *Sammohana (infatuation)*</p>
