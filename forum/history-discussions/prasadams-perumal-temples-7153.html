</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear all!<br />Now a days there are temples that provides free noon meals to pilgrims ans of course we can make sure that local vendors who sells flowers, coconut etc., take this and some beggars too join them. may few one or two pilgrims also may join.</p>
<p>During festival time we are seeing people q up before the persons to take the holy prasad so that they believe if he/ she consume that they are blessed. and they take them as a sentiment.</p>
<p>The Sivan temples during Pradoshams distribute good volume of Prasad and even if you take a sugar pongal can you can also distribute.</p>
<p>But were as in Perumal temple they are not giving Prasad as Sivan temple, and one day I received 32 parukkai of Puliyodarai and seven numbers of Sundal.</p>
<p>But the persons who sung Divya prabandham took a leaves full of Sweet Pongal, Kesari, Dhadyannam, etc., which were not offered to the devotees. That too they ate everything in the presence of devotees.(Daily!)</p>
<p>But the same in Sivan Temples, the OOddhuvars also sung Devaram they are not getting any special attention and no extra prasadms were given to them.</p>
<p>The Perumal temple they did not allow any other person to distribute any food items.</p>
<p>What is the reason?</p>

        <p>Friends,<br />?<br />If we can discuss things openly without involving bias, we can see the other person's point of view or be able to answer other person's questions. :) It would be wonderful, if we discuss things openly and help rid people of their bias.</p>

<p>I am not telling that Perumal temples are bad</p>
<p>SeeI am a person who is seeing man kind in every action in Human.</p>
<p>Some time I came across certain people who think they are gods.</p>
<p>ThatI am a person who visits temples and see the science behind them.</p>
<p>When no one was available for my question why we have so many Gods and Goddess every one answered which didn't appear scientifically.</p>
<p>But when I read inscriptions about the temples and managements I found thatthe temples were as bankers extracted money from Chettiars who? took money from the temple who were traders.<br />The persons who were unable to pay were made as slaves to the temple.<br />If a person marry He has to pay a tax. If a? Couple? goes from their parents and wish to live? separately they are to pay tax to the temple., all to the Vaishnava Temple. Do you need evidences?</p>
<p>Well. Mr.B.K. Pandeya had written a thesis on this and published a book titled Temple economy under the Colas. in 1984.</p>
<p>If I mention everything we the people in Tamil nadu will put our head down.All are collected from inscriptions available with <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym . He has submitted the the South India Inscriptions? in every foot note. I veryfied every thing.</p>
<p>It is my duty when writting a thesis I should not put everything? in favour of Religion and we must apply our mind on the religion. Religion is for the people and people are not for the religion!</p>
<p>You must know onething.<br />Atom was discovered by Vedic people in B.C.23,000<br />It was reproduced in a 1914 magazine.</p>
<p>The english diverted our mind from Science and grabbed everything in their favour. and earned money and robbed us.</p>
<p>But as a human we are seeing you are Iyengar, Mudaliar naidu etc.,</p>
<p>When it comes to temple there is more Politics.</p>
<p>In A.D. 1300 we surrendered everything to muslims and in 1760? we had number of Muslims as Trustees!</p>
<p>There every one swindled money.<br />This is also a thesis.</p>
<p>Have you visited Kancheepuram Varadaraja temple?<br />The butter will give Tulsee and water only when you offer a? five rupee coin in his plate. I offered two rs coin and asked for water for which he refussed!</p>
<p>This is a place we live.</p>
<p>Later when I came out of the temple two Prists on a bike crossed me and threatened me. See a person who don't have a five rupee coin with HIM.</p>
<p>Is this a way to behave?</p>
<p>The reason for my visit to that temple is that it has a copper kavacham in the? Godess shrine! I wanted to interview the priest what are all the side effects he gets since he is sitting under the copper roofed cover for 5 hrs a day.</p>
<p>For answering that he wanted Rs10/= is this the correct way? Does the Perumal asked him to rob a man for Rupees and answer a common question whichs answer will benefit the society?</p>
<p>But when asked the same type of question with other temples it was responded in all the ways and they were happy to co-operate with me.</p>
<p>But anyhow let me compleate my thesis that will answer our present generation.</p>

<p>Dear Ramachandran,</p>
<p>You asked first why you were not allowed to distribute the sweet pongal that you prepared and took to the temple. The?Bhattar ill-treated you there.</p>
<p>For this I said that?"Preparation" is the issue and also condemned the behaviour of the Bhattar who could have explained you politely instead of ill-treating you.</p>
<p>The 32 parukkais of Puliyodharai and 7pieces of Sundal for common devotees and for an elite few a lot, is the next question. </p>
<p>For this too I clarified?how?those few people came to?earn more. I did clarify saying that though it was relevant in older days when the custom was?initiated, it?has no relevance and if?the act of continuing it still means only?sheer bureaucracy. Again I did not defend the practice. Now a Prasadham is a Prasadham. In temples they offer Theertham which is onlya few droplets at best. Why is no one questioning it. Why only the question comes for prasadham? That too with exact counts like 32 parukkais and 7 sundals. When one sees it as a Prasadham, which is offered to God even 1 parukkai of Puliyodharai and 1 sundal is a prasadham. </p>
<p><Next when Sivan temple during? Pradoshams offering? giving away food to 100s, why not the Perumal Temple? </p>
<p>I dont know why you would want to compare with a Sivan temple always for everything. Can I just ask back a question? Why is it that when the Perumal Temples of TamizhNadu gives foremost importance to Tamizh pAsurams and thosewho sing are glorified with more than 32 parukkais of Puliyodharai and more than 7 Sundal, the Sivan temple keeps the Odhuvar out and ill-treat them?</p>
<p>Regarding the Noon Meals, it is done in Perumal Temples also. Standing Example in Chennai itself if ThiruvallikkENi. If that is what you meant.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br />PS: Sorry if this mail of mine had hurt anyone. At the first instance I thought Mr Ramachandran' s question was genuine but now, from the below mail, I get a feeling that he just wants to say that Perumal Temples are bad. Period. I had replied and comdemned the acts of the Bhattars clearly in my first two mails. He had not taken cognizance of that in his reply below and that is what made me write this.</p>

<p>The question here not the preparation</p>
<p>When devotees are offered 32 parukkais of Puliotharai and 7 pieces of sundal how the Persons singing PAsurams take large quanity before the? devotees?<br />Let them take it from Kitchen directly and let them pack and take it to thehome and take.<br />Next when Sivan temple during? Pradoshams offering? giving away food to100s, why not the Perumal Temple?</p>
<p>Even mid day food is offere at Sivan Temple and? not in Perumal temple Why?</p>

<p>Perhaps all the modern eateries must have picked up this practice from<br />Perumal temples - outside food not allowed!</p>
<p>Every temple follows some rules sanctified by some agamas and sanctioned<br />by tradition. One has to be patient and strive to understand the<br />tradition. If there is resistance to deviate from the tradition, and<br />arguments start, the issue becomes blurred, niceties are forgotten and<br />the 'fight' becomes a free for all; one side wants to stick to tradition<br />and rules, while the other who has put in lot of effort and incurred<br />expnses feels his basic rights are not respected..</p>
<p>I believe, in all Perumal temples only the prasad cooked in the<br />madaipalli is offered to Perumal and distributed.<br />Sampath<br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, rama chandran<br /><rramachandran_ 1951@....  wrote:</p>

<p>prasadham as food for the day. These people who sing prabhandhams are<br />called "adhyApakAs" .. They had no other means of earning a livelihood.<br />So in order to arrange for their food, they were given a large portion<br />of the offerings to Perumal. Well it was still not sufficiently large<br />for a family and that is a different story. These "adhyApakAs" will be<br />only 8 or 10 in number. Remaining reciters are all treated like normal<br />devotees. Also, the large portion was given in recognition of their<br />services of rendering the DivyaPrabhandams. This practice was started by<br />NathamunigaL during the 900s and today after 1100 years, with utmost no<br />relevance, is still being continued.REASON: Sheer Bureaucracy! ! Nothing<br />else.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The question by you is very correct. Simply said they are just<br />commanding respect. Period. This has no relevance in the present day</p></blockquote>
<p>where in the sons and daughters of most of these "adhyApakAs" stay in<br />Foreign countries and they have good livelihood. But you might have seen<br />this only in some wealthy temples like Kanchi, ThiruvallikkeNi etc. In<br />most of the PerumaL Koils in the Kumbakonam Belt and Thirunangur Areas,<br />even the Perumal gets the same amount of food that a normal devotee<br />gets.</p>
<blockquote><p>  <The Perumal temple they did not allow any other person to distribute<br />any food items.<br />  What is the reason? </the></p>
<p>  Well, a donor can pay for a load of prasadham and on getting it after<br />offering to Perumal, he can distribute it to others. I have seen this in</p></blockquote>
<p>almost all Perumal Temples myself. Only that such instances may be very<br />less. Can you please let me know which Perumal temple did not allow<br />others to distribute and the context. I am not challenging here but<br />curious to know.</p>

        <p>Dear Ramachandran,</p>
<p>I prefer to take this out and discuss on a personal mail.?I agree with some of your views and have done this?from your first mail itself. </p>
<p>In order?not disturb the harmony of the discussions in this groups, I suggest that we take it out and discuss. If you are interested, please let me know?personally and I will be glad to reply you. Of course, you can add some list of people you?wish in the CC?fields.</p>
<p>With this I stop my response on this in our threads.<br />?<br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>I am not telling that Perumal temples are bad</p>
<p>SeeI am a person who is seeing man kind in every action in Human.</p>
<p>Some time I came across certain people who think they are gods.</p>
<p>ThatI am a person who visits temples and see the science behind them.</p>
<p>When no one was available for my question why we have so many Gods and Goddess every one answered which didn't appear scientifically.</p>
<p>But when I read inscriptions about the temples and managements I found thatthe temples were as bankers extracted money from Chettiars who? took money from the temple who were traders.<br />The persons who were unable to pay were made as slaves to the temple.<br />If a person marry He has to pay a tax. If a? Couple? goes from their parents and wish to live? separately they are to pay tax to the temple., all to the Vaishnava Temple. Do you need evidences?</p>
<p>Well. Mr.B.K. Pandeya had written a thesis on this and published a book titled Temple economy under the Colas. in 1984.</p>
<p>If I mention everything we the people in Tamil nadu will put our head down.All are collected from inscriptions available with <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym . He has submitted the the South India Inscriptions? in every foot note. I veryfied every thing.</p>
<p>It is my duty when writting a thesis I should not put everything? in favour of Religion and we must apply our mind on the religion. Religion is for the people and people are not for the religion!</p>
<p>You must know onething.<br />Atom was discovered by Vedic people in B.C.23,000<br />It was reproduced in a 1914 magazine.</p>
<p>The english diverted our mind from Science and grabbed everything in their favour. and earned money and robbed us.</p>
<p>But as a human we are seeing you are Iyengar, Mudaliar naidu etc.,</p>
<p>When it comes to temple there is more Politics.</p>
<p>In A.D. 1300 we surrendered everything to muslims and in 1760? we had number of Muslims as Trustees!</p>
<p>There every one swindled money.<br />This is also a thesis.</p>
<p>Have you visited Kancheepuram Varadaraja temple?<br />The butter will give Tulsee and water only when you offer a? five rupee coin in his plate. I offered two rs coin and asked for water for which he refussed!</p>
<p>This is a place we live.</p>
<p>Later when I came out of the temple two Prists on a bike crossed me and threatened me. See a person who don't have a five rupee coin with HIM.</p>
<p>Is this a way to behave?</p>
<p>The reason for my visit to that temple is that it has a copper kavacham in the? Godess shrine! I wanted to interview the priest what are all the side effects he gets since he is sitting under the copper roofed cover for 5 hrs a day.</p>
<p>For answering that he wanted Rs10/= is this the correct way? Does the Perumal asked him to rob a man for Rupees and answer a common question whichs answer will benefit the society?</p>
<p>But when asked the same type of question with other temples it was responded in all the ways and they were happy to co-operate with me.</p>
<p>But anyhow let me compleate my thesis that will answer our present generation.</p>

<p>Dear Ramachandran,</p>
<p>You asked first why you were not allowed to distribute the sweet pongal that you prepared and took to the temple. The?Bhattar ill-treated you there.</p>
<p>For this I said that?"Preparation" is the issue and also condemned the behaviour of the Bhattar who could have explained you politely instead of ill-treating you.</p>
<p>The 32 parukkais of Puliyodharai and 7pieces of Sundal for common devotees and for an elite few a lot, is the next question. </p>
<p>For this too I clarified?how?those few people came to?earn more. I did clarify saying that though it was relevant in older days when the custom was?initiated, it?has no relevance and if?the act of continuing it still means only?sheer bureaucracy. Again I did not defend the practice. Now a Prasadham is a Prasadham. In temples they offer Theertham which is onlya few droplets at best. Why is no one questioning it. Why only the question comes for prasadham? That too with exact counts like 32 parukkais and 7 sundals. When one sees it as a Prasadham, which is offered to God even 1 parukkai of Puliyodharai and 1 sundal is a prasadham. </p>
<p><Next when Sivan temple during? Pradoshams offering? giving away food to 100s, why not the Perumal Temple? </p>
<p>I dont know why you would want to compare with a Sivan temple always for everything. Can I just ask back a question? Why is it that when the Perumal Temples of TamizhNadu gives foremost importance to Tamizh pAsurams and thosewho sing are glorified with more than 32 parukkais of Puliyodharai and more than 7 Sundal, the Sivan temple keeps the Odhuvar out and ill-treat them?</p>
<p>Regarding the Noon Meals, it is done in Perumal Temples also. Standing Example in Chennai itself if ThiruvallikkENi. If that is what you meant.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br />PS: Sorry if this mail of mine had hurt anyone. At the first instance I thought Mr Ramachandran' s question was genuine but now, from the below mail, I get a feeling that he just wants to say that Perumal Temples are bad. Period. I had replied and comdemned the acts of the Bhattars clearly in my first two mails. He had not taken cognizance of that in his reply below and that is what made me write this.</p>

<p>The question here not the preparation</p>
<p>When devotees are offered 32 parukkais of Puliotharai and 7 pieces of sundal how the Persons singing PAsurams take large quanity before the? devotees?<br />Let them take it from Kitchen directly and let them pack and take it to thehome and take.<br />Next when Sivan temple during? Pradoshams offering? giving away food to100s, why not the Perumal Temple?</p>
<p>Even mid day food is offere at Sivan Temple and? not in Perumal temple Why?</p>

<p>Perhaps all the modern eateries must have picked up this practice from<br />Perumal temples - outside food not allowed!</p>
<p>Every temple follows some rules sanctified by some agamas and sanctioned<br />by tradition. One has to be patient and strive to understand the<br />tradition. If there is resistance to deviate from the tradition, and<br />arguments start, the issue becomes blurred, niceties are forgotten and<br />the 'fight' becomes a free for all; one side wants to stick to tradition<br />and rules, while the other who has put in lot of effort and incurred<br />expnses feels his basic rights are not respected..</p>
<p>I believe, in all Perumal temples only the prasad cooked in the<br />madaipalli is offered to Perumal and distributed.<br />Sampath<br />--- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, rama chandran<br /><rramachandran_ 1951@....  wrote:</p>

<p>prasadham as food for the day. These people who sing prabhandhams are<br />called "adhyApakAs" .. They had no other means of earning a livelihood.<br />So in order to arrange for their food, they were given a large portion<br />of the offerings to Perumal. Well it was still not sufficiently large<br />for a family and that is a different story. These "adhyApakAs" will be<br />only 8 or 10 in number. Remaining reciters are all treated like normal<br />devotees. Also, the large portion was given in recognition of their<br />services of rendering the DivyaPrabhandams. This practice was started by<br />NathamunigaL during the 900s and today after 1100 years, with utmost no<br />relevance, is still being continued.REASON: Sheer Bureaucracy! ! Nothing<br />else.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The question by you is very correct. Simply said they are just<br />commanding respect. Period. This has no relevance in the present day</p></blockquote>
<p>where in the sons and daughters of most of these "adhyApakAs" stay in<br />Foreign countries and they have good livelihood. But you might have seen<br />this only in some wealthy temples like Kanchi, ThiruvallikkeNi etc. In<br />most of the PerumaL Koils in the Kumbakonam Belt and Thirunangur Areas,<br />even the Perumal gets the same amount of food that a normal devotee<br />gets.</p>
<blockquote><p>  <The Perumal temple they did not allow any other person to distribute<br />any food items.<br />  What is the reason? </the></p>
<p>  Well, a donor can pay for a load of prasadham and on getting it after<br />offering to Perumal, he can distribute it to others. I have seen this in</p></blockquote>
<p>almost all Perumal Temples myself. Only that such instances may be very<br />less. Can you please let me know which Perumal temple did not allow<br />others to distribute and the context. I am not challenging here but<br />curious to know.</p>

          Prasadams at Perumal Temples        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Ramachandran,</p>
<p>You asked first why you were not allowed to distribute the sweet pongal that you prepared and took to the temple. The?Bhattar ill-treated you there.</p>
<p>For this I said that?"Preparation" is the issue and also condemned the behaviour of the Bhattar who could have explained you politely instead of ill-treating you.</p>
<p>The 32 parukkais of Puliyodharai and 7pieces of Sundal for common devotees and for an elite few a lot, is the next question. </p>
<p>For this too I clarified?how?those few people came to?earn more. I did clarify saying that though it was relevant in older days when the custom was?initiated, it?has no relevance and if?the act of continuing it still means only?sheer bureaucracy. Again I did not defend the practice. Now a Prasadham is a Prasadham. In temples they offer Theertham which is onlya few droplets at best. Why is no one questioning it. Why only the question comes for prasadham? That too with exact counts like 32 parukkais and 7 sundals. When one sees it as a Prasadham, which is offered to God even 1 parukkai of Puliyodharai and 1 sundal is a prasadham. </p>
<p><Next when Sivan temple during? Pradoshams offering? giving away food to 100s, why not the Perumal Temple? </p>
<p>I dont know why you would want to compare with a Sivan temple always for everything. Can I just ask back a question? Why is it that when the Perumal Temples of TamizhNadu gives foremost importance to Tamizh pAsurams and thosewho sing are glorified with more than 32 parukkais of Puliyodharai and more than 7 Sundal, the Sivan temple keeps the Odhuvar out and ill-treat them?</p>
<p>Regarding the Noon Meals, it is done in Perumal Temples also. Standing Example in Chennai itself if ThiruvallikkENi. If that is what you meant.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br />PS: Sorry if this mail of mine had hurt anyone. At the first instance I thought Mr Ramachandran's question was genuine but now, from the below mail, Iget a feeling that he just wants to say that Perumal Temples are bad. Period. I had replied and comdemned the acts of the Bhattars clearly in my first two mails. He had not taken cognizance of that in his reply below and that is what made me write this.</p>

        <p>Perhaps all the modern eateries must have picked up this practice from<br />Perumal temples - outside food not allowed!</p>
<p>Every temple follows some rules sanctified by some agamas and sanctioned<br />by tradition. One has to be patient and strive to understand the<br />tradition. If there is resistance to deviate from the tradition, and<br />arguments start, the issue becomes blurred, niceties are forgotten and<br />the 'fight' becomes a free for all; one side wants to stick to tradition<br />and rules, while the other who has put in lot of effort and incurred<br />expnses feels his basic rights are not respected.</p>
<p>I believe, in all Perumal temples only the prasad cooked in the<br />madaipalli is offered to Perumal and distributed.<br />Sampath<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, rama chandran<br /><rramachandran_1951@...  wrote:</p>

<p>  Well, a donor can pay for a load of prasadham and on getting it after offering to Perumal, he can distribute it to others. I have seen this in almost all Perumal Temples myself. Only that such instances may be very less. Can you please let me know which Perumal temple did not allow others to distribute and the context. I am not challenging here but curious to know.</p>

        <p>And that is precisely why Singing Tamizh pAsurams in Sivan Temples is stilla?Herculean effort. </p>
<p>NathamunigaL?did this?Tamizh pAsuram propagation in a very clever manner as he realized the greatness of these pAsurams.?Probably we can?say that NathamunigaL was the founder of the?"SatthuNavu thittam" and not?MGR. NathamunigaL on hearing the wonderful pAsurams and the liveliness?wanted to propagate?it. There was a stiff?resistance for allowing Tamizh into the temples. It is said that?NathamunigaL even went to extent of getting a Royal Whip delivered in this regard. The king whom?he approached could have been either Rajaraja or?Rajendra, as they were the rulers?during the times of NathamunigaL. </p>
<p>The?Prasadham?could just have been one concession for those singing Tamizh pAsurams.?Now thanks to NathamunigaL and his able successors, no?PerumaL temple is complete without Tamizh PAsurams. There are?temples wherethere is none to recite Vedas.?But there are no temple where there?is no one?to sing a Tamizh?pAsuram.?</p>
<p>While the Vaishnavite temples gradually accepted the Tamizh renderings, theSaivite temples found stiff?resistence and that is why we are seeing so much noise being made into the Chidambaram temple affair. Of course we all know how much Rajaraja had to?sweat to bring?out the Thirumurais.?<br />?<br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

          Prasadams at Perumal Temples        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Well I get your point here. According to the Pancharathra Agama?or the Vaikhanasa Agama,?only the food prepared in the "thirumadaippaLLi" (Temple Kitchen) shall be offered to God and only that is offered to Perumal can bedistributed within the?temple premises. </p>
<p>Any food "cooked" by persons other than the "initiated and appointed" temple cook will not be offered to PerumaL. However uncooked food,?brought by devotees shall be offered to PerumaL. This includes, fruits, coconut etc that are natural. To my knowledge, in older days even "kalkaNDu" was not offered to PerumaL as it somehow undergoes cooking. But somehow this has got diluted and has now found a way for offering to Perumal.</p>
<p>Hope now you got?the reason for getting turned out. Of course the Bhattars are arrogant at times and I dont intend to defend them any way. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

Also, the large portion was given in recognition of their services of rendering the DivyaPrabhandams.This practice was started by NathamunigaL during the 900s? and today after 1100 years, with utmost no relevance, is still being continued.REASON: Sheer Bureaucracy! !

<p>The question by you is very correct. Simply said they are just commanding respect. Period. This has no relevance in the present day where in the sons and daughters of most of these "adhyApakAs" stay in Foreign countries and they?have good livelihood.

<p>Well, a donor can pay for a load of prasadham and on getting it after offering to Perumal, he can distribute it to others. I have seen this in almost all Perumal Temples myself. Only that such instances may be very less. Can you please let me know which Perumal temple did not allow others to distribute and the context. I am not challenging here but curious to know.</p>

          Prasadams at Perumal Temples        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>rramachandran</p>
<p><But the persons who sung Divya prabandham took a leaves full of Sweet Pongal, Kesari, Dhadyannam, etc., which were not offered to the devotees. That too they ate everything in the presence of devotees.(Daily! ) </p>
<p>Yes, this does not look good. But the history behind this practice is different. In older days those who sang the prabhandhams got only the prasadham as food for the day. These people who sing prabhandhams are called "adhyApakAs". They had no other means of earning a livelihood. So in order to arrange for their food, they were given a large portion of the offerings to Perumal. Well it was still not sufficiently large for a family and that is a different story. These "adhyApakAs" will be only 8 or 10 in number. Remainingreciters are all treated like normal devotees. Also, the large portion wasgiven in recognition of their services of rendering the DivyaPrabhandams. This practice was started by NathamunigaL during the 900s? and today after 1100 years, with utmost no relevance, is still being continued.REASON: Sheer Bureaucracy!! Nothing else.</p>
<p>The question by you is very correct. Simply said they are just commanding respect. Period. This has no relevance in the present day where in the sons and daughters of most of these "adhyApakAs" stay in Foreign countries and they?have good livelihood. But you might have seen this only in some wealthy temples like Kanchi, ThiruvallikkeNi etc. In most of the PerumaL Koils in the Kumbakonam Belt and Thirunangur Areas, even the Perumal gets the sameamount of food that a normal devotee gets. </p>
<p><The Perumal temple they did not allow any other person to distribute any food items.<br />What is the reason? </the></p>
<p>Well, a donor can pay for a load of prasadham and on getting it after offering to Perumal, he can distribute it to others. I have seen this in almost all Perumal Temples myself. Only that such instances may be very less. Can you please let me know which Perumal temple did not allow others to distribute and the context. I am not challenging here but curious to know.</p>
