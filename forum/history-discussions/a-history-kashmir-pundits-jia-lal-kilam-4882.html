<p>check out above ebook - </p>
<p>some extracts..</p>
<p>Chapter II - ends on a meloncholy note</p>
<p>Thus ended the Hindu rule, not as a result of a foreign aggression, <br />as in the case of the neighbouring province of the Punjab, but as a <br />result of a long chain of events briefly surveyed in the foregoing <br />pages. </p>
<p>chapter iv</p>
<p>Shahi Khan now known as Zainulabdin opened a new chapter in the <br />earlier the Muslims, particularly the Arabs, had almost monopolized <br />the trade in the East. Arab ships went as far as China and Japan. In <br />the fourteenth century these traders had established their colonies <br />in South India, Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, and even in China. Their <br />contacts with races and religions other than their own had widened <br />their outlook. The enormous gains which they reaped from trade <br />abroad made them keep their countries open for non-Muslim traders <br />too. Fresh ideas poured into the Muslim lands. With the free flow of <br />ideas which now broke through the iron ring of strict isolation, it <br />was but natural that the Governments too in most Muslim countries <br />became very tolerant. Poets and philosophers with a radical outlook <br />came into being and inspite of the rigidity of the Muslim Code there <br />came about a revolution in men's minds.</p>
<p>......      <br />Zainulabdin got a poisonous boil which gave him much trouble. The <br />court physicians tried their skill but failed, Jona Raja, the <br />historian says "As flowers are not obtainable in the month of Magha <br />on account of the mischief by snow, even so physicians who knew <br />about poisons could not at that time be found in the country owing <br />to Governmental oppression. The servants of the king at last found <br />out Shri Bhatta who knew the antidotes of poisons and was well-<br />versed in the art of healing, but out of fear he, for a long time <br />delayed to come. When he arrived, the king gave him encouragement <br />and he completely cured the king of the poisonous boil." The king <br />wanted to make munificent gifts to Shri Bhatta. But the latter <br />refused to accept any. But when pressed hard, he made a request <br />which was to the effect that the Jazia on the Brahmans be remitted, <br />and opportunities be assured to them to develop their mental and <br />moral resources without any let or hinderance. The selflessness <br />displayed by the physician Shri Bhatta had its effect upon the mind <br />of the king. The request was accepted and Jazia was remitted. The <br />Brahman was freed from the position of inferiority to which he was <br />relegated by the previous kings. </p>
<p>Shri Bhatta's selflessness and the acceptance of his request by the <br />king proved a land-mark in the history of Hinduism in Kashmir</p>
<p>Chapter V</p>
<p>But Hassan Khan had his own virtues. The seed of cultural unity sown <br />by Zainulabdin "had borne enough fruit in him". Hassan Khan was a <br />great Sanskrit scholar and well-versed in the Hindu Philosophy. It <br />is said about him that " the king freed of envy had learnt the six <br />Schools of philosophy, and the different works of these six Schools <br />became one in him." Making allowance for the poetical exaggeration <br />of the poet historian, it can safely be inferred that Hassan Khan <br />had drunk deep from the fountain of Sanskrit learning and his hatred <br />for Hinduism was at the lowest ebb or had none at all. Shri Vara <br />says that he made a good use of his wealth by building Mathas and <br />endowing villages in favour of Brahmans." The Pandits performed a <br />big Homa on the day of his coronation. The mere fact that the king <br />permitted such a ceremony to be performed on the auspicious day of <br />his coronation shows that he possessed a fair measure of religious <br />toleration.</p>
<p>Chapter VII</p>
<p>Both man and nature combined its forces to work for their <br />destruction. There was an acute class prejudice against them and <br />every attempt was made to break their power and solidarity by such <br />highly questionable methods as even death and forcible conversions. <br />In every turmoil that rose and in every civil war that ensued the <br />Pandit was dragged into it much against his will and he was made to <br />pay his toll</p>

        <p>dear senthil</p>
<p>You get to see what is written but not what happened. take the case <br />Genghis Khan- he is an iconic and beloved figure in Mongolia, where <br />he is seen as the father of the Mongol Nation. On the other hand, in <br />many areas of southwestern Asia, Middle East and Europe, he is seen <br />as a ruthless and bloodthirsty conquerer.</p>
<p>Am sure <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  would have been seen in similar light in the <br />countries they waged wars with - but for us they are heros.</acronym></p>
<p>There are instances even within our own state - of religious <br />intolerance - take instances of appar being tourtured by mahendra <br />pallavar ( against his conversion from jainism to shivaite),  <br />ramanuja / vaisnavites were subjected to innumerable hardships <br />during Kulothunga chola II ( still a point of contention) and  <br />subsequently ramanuja went on a 12-year exile in Melkote, in <br />Karnataka.</p>
<p>history is strive with these occurances - entire races/religions <br />have been decimated - hv you heard of a now extinct religion called <br />manuism. </p>
<p>Its the premordial rule of nature - survivial of the fittest and the <br />eternal quest for power - which has fueled human enterprise so far. <br />A hungry lion is not expected to show mercy on a fawn simiarly a <br />swooping eagle doesnt spare a chic...this is nature. eat or be <br />eaten. </p>
<p>so where is the question of mercy, being fair etc etc to your <br />opponents. </p>
<p>Our foremost epic mahabarta itself has these instances:</p>
<p>The great krishna employed every possible guile to vanquish the <br />kauravas - every death on the kaurava camp ( only one of abhimanyu <br />in the opposite camp) right from bheesma, bagadatha, karna, <br />duryodana - even the lofty yudishtira lied to get rid of drona ( his <br />chariot was supposed to be moving a few feet of the ground till then <br />and as he uttered this it fell to the ground...), - if there were a <br />fair fight - each of these great warriors could have individually <br />routed the pandava army....</p>

<p>some extracts..</p>
<p>Chapter II - ends on a meloncholy note</p>
<p>Thus ended the Hindu rule, not as a result of a foreign aggression, <br />as in the case of the neighbouring province of the Punjab, but as a <br />result of a long chain of events briefly surveyed in the foregoing <br />pages. </p>
<p>chapter iv</p>
<p>Shahi Khan now known as Zainulabdin opened a new chapter in the <br />earlier the Muslims, particularly the Arabs, had almost monopolized <br />the trade in the East. Arab ships went as far as China and Japan. In <br />the fourteenth century these traders had established their colonies <br />in South India, Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, and even in China. Their <br />contacts with races and religions other than their own had widened <br />their outlook. The enormous gains which they reaped from trade <br />abroad made them keep their countries open for non-Muslim traders <br />too. Fresh ideas poured into the Muslim lands. With the free flow of <br />ideas which now broke through the iron ring of strict isolation, it <br />was but natural that the Governments too in most Muslim countries <br />became very tolerant. Poets and philosophers with a radical outlook <br />came into being and inspite of the rigidity of the Muslim Code there <br />came about a revolution in men's minds.</p>
<p>......      <br />Zainulabdin got a poisonous boil which gave him much trouble. The <br />court physicians tried their skill but failed, Jona Raja, the <br />historian says "As flowers are not obtainable in the month of Magha <br />on account of the mischief by snow, even so physicians who knew <br />about poisons could not at that time be found in the country owing <br />to Governmental oppression. The servants of the king at last found <br />out Shri Bhatta who knew the antidotes of poisons and was well-<br />versed in the art of healing, but out of fear he, for a long time <br />delayed to come. When he arrived, the king gave him encouragement <br />and he completely cured the king of the poisonous boil." The king <br />wanted to make munificent gifts to Shri Bhatta. But the latter <br />refused to accept any. But when pressed hard, he made a request <br />which was to the effect that the Jazia on the Brahmans be remitted, <br />and opportunities be assured to them to develop their mental and <br />moral resources without any let or hinderance. The selflessness <br />displayed by the physician Shri Bhatta had its effect upon the mind <br />of the king. The request was accepted and Jazia was remitted. The <br />Brahman was freed from the position of inferiority to which he was <br />relegated by the previous kings. </p>
<p>Shri Bhatta's selflessness and the acceptance of his request by the <br />king proved a land-mark in the history of Hinduism in Kashmir</p>
<p>Chapter V</p>
<p>But Hassan Khan had his own virtues. The seed of cultural unity sown <br />by Zainulabdin "had borne enough fruit in him". Hassan Khan was a <br />great Sanskrit scholar and well-versed in the Hindu Philosophy. It <br />is said about him that " the king freed of envy had learnt the six <br />Schools of philosophy, and the different works of these six Schools <br />became one in him." Making allowance for the poetical exaggeration <br />of the poet historian, it can safely be inferred that Hassan Khan <br />had drunk deep from the fountain of Sanskrit learning and his hatred <br />for Hinduism was at the lowest ebb or had none at all. Shri Vara <br />says that he made a good use of his wealth by building Mathas and <br />endowing villages in favour of Brahmans." The Pandits performed a <br />big Homa on the day of his coronation. The mere fact that the king <br />permitted such a ceremony to be performed on the auspicious day of <br />his coronation shows that he possessed a fair measure of religious <br />toleration.</p>
<p>Chapter VII</p>
<p>Both man and nature combined its forces to work for their <br />destruction. There was an acute class prejudice against them and <br />every attempt was made to break their power and solidarity by such <br />highly questionable methods as even death and forcible conversions. <br />In every turmoil that rose and in every civil war that ensued the <br />Pandit was dragged into it much against his will and he was made to <br />pay his toll</p>
