Also since<br />  this controversy has started, Kamal (I am really sorry that I<br />  misquoted him earlier) had given a beautiful counter attack to him. I<br />  know many people have suggested this before, Like Gokul sir gave a<br />  precise sources for Chola pass in the previous mail, can we compile<br />  all the data PS group have to answer Madan?

<p>      Hi,<br />      I have been read Madan's reply and counter reply by Sri. Gokul</p>
<p>    GOKUL ? He has not replied Madan..</p>
<p>    It is Kamal @ adithakarikalan of our group.<br />    One of the Editors of varalaaru.com team.</p>
<p>    Iraiyanbu.IAS asked Madan to write on Tamil Kings (as he has written<br />    on Moghuls).</p>
<p>    Madan replied the documentation by Tamil Kings is not sufficient to<br />    take up such task. Also poets and others flattered more in literature.</p>
<p>    This attracted criticism..</p>
<p>    Kamal, in varalaaru.com brought out an article highlighting enough<br />    materials made avl already by Sastri &amp; Pandrathar and others.</p>
<p>    Madan appreciated the effort to bring historical details under a .com<br />    - named as varalaaru.com for reference. He also referred the same<br />    Scholars and mentioned that these details are not sufficient to carry<br />    on a work.</p>
<p>    Re Cholapass, our Dear Venkat brought out a version that it was 200 yr<br />    old Tibetian word.</p>
<p>    I already posted that there is mention of these in Periyapurnam. .</p>
<p>    Some of of us in our Group already commenced woprks on RRC History..<br />    and will be needing support of other scholarly members...</p>
<p>    We will fullfil IAS Iraiyanbu's wish.. to the best of our ability<br />  ourself.</p>
<p>    sps</p>
<p>    and now<br />      by Madan again. I think Madan is right from what he is saying, we dont<br />      have "detailed" descriptions or day to day activities as seen in<br />  other<br />      emperor's times..to put in madan's words like baburnama.<br />      But we cannot blame the kings for not maintaining a diary. Also we<br />      cannot blame ourselves for not discovering everything as of now.<br />  There<br />      are things yet to discover. (Maybe PS/varalaru group can discover<br />      something crucial, who knows)<br />      As of now with the material we have, we can speculate rather than<br />      conclude.<br />      Ragothaman</p>

<p>          Hi rahul<br />          your choice of words and stringing them together is great.<br />          like madan said " unarchi miguthiyaal ennai thaakki<br />  irukkiraarkal"<br />          if you noticed the article in varalaaru.com and the initial<br />    reactions<br />          to it in this group as well as the reactions printed in<br />    varalaaru.com<br />          are full of emotions.</p>
<p>          it reminds me of a typical dravidian election party meeting. the<br />          standard formula was to start meeting with " thamilan endru<br />          solladaa, thalai nimirnthu nilladaa...' or acham enbathu<br />          madamaiyadaa. anjaamai draavidan udamaiyadaa. ..<br />          after that 90% of the audience could be led by the speaker like a<br />          calf on a tether rope.<br />          also the meeting would be full of words like " anna enna<br />  sonnaar?'.<br />          they would keep on repeating that but never tell what anna<br />  said till<br />          the end.<br />          venketesh</p>
<p>            I loved the piece where Madan descirbes the "virundhombal"<br />  by the<br />          kings to<br />            poets. The clinical crushing of the "Chola pass" theory was<br />          stunning!!</p>
<p>            I feel our replies to such learned people should also be in a<br />          similar vein.<br />            Our emotional outbursts would actually be doing us more harm<br />  than<br />          good.<br />            Instead it would be good if our efforts are focussed on proving<br />          Madan wrong<br />            with hard, cold facts. The RRC book might be a good starter.</p>
<p>            Even though Shankar's 23am Pulikesi might have been too comical<br />          looks like<br />            there are certain truths in there. This poet treatment<br />  instance is<br />          one.</p>
<p>            Hope all our efforts end up in proving the obvious greatness<br />  our<br />          land.</p>

<p>    Hi,<br />    I have been read Madan's reply and counter reply by Sri. Gokul</p>
<p>  GOKUL ? He has not replied Madan..</p>
<p>  It is Kamal @ adithakarikalan of our group.  <br />  One of the Editors of varalaaru.com team.</p>
<p>  Iraiyanbu.IAS asked Madan to write on Tamil Kings (as he has written<br />  on Moghuls).</p>
<p>  Madan replied the documentation by Tamil Kings is not sufficient to<br />  take up such task. Also poets and others flattered more in literature.</p>
<p>  This attracted criticism..</p>
<p>  Kamal, in varalaaru.com brought out an article highlighting enough<br />  materials made avl already by Sastri &amp; Pandrathar and others.</p>
<p>  Madan appreciated the effort to bring historical details under a .com<br />  - named as varalaaru.com for reference. He also referred the same<br />  Scholars and mentioned that these details are not sufficient to carry<br />  on a work.</p>
<p>  Re Cholapass, our Dear Venkat brought out a version that it was 200 yr<br />  old Tibetian word.</p>
<p>  I already posted that there is mention of these in Periyapurnam..</p>
<p>  Some of of us in our Group already commenced woprks on RRC History..<br />  and will be needing support of other scholarly members...</p>
<p>  We will fullfil IAS Iraiyanbu's wish.. to the best of our ability<br />ourself.</p>
<p>  sps</p>
<p>  and now<br />    by Madan again. I think Madan is right from what he is saying, we dont<br />    have "detailed" descriptions or day to day activities as seen in other<br />    emperor's times..to put in madan's words like baburnama.<br />    But we cannot blame the kings for not maintaining a diary. Also we<br />    cannot blame ourselves for not discovering everything as of now. There<br />    are things yet to discover. (Maybe PS/varalaru group can discover<br />    something crucial, who knows)<br />    As of now with the material we have, we can speculate rather than<br />    conclude.<br />    Ragothaman</p>

<p>        Hi rahul<br />        your choice of words and stringing them together is great.<br />        like madan said " unarchi miguthiyaal ennai thaakki irukkiraarkal"<br />        if you noticed the article in varalaaru.com and the initial<br />  reactions<br />        to it in this group as well as the reactions printed in<br />  varalaaru.com<br />        are full of emotions.</p>
<p>        it reminds me of a typical dravidian election party meeting. the<br />        standard formula was to start meeting with " thamilan endru<br />        solladaa, thalai nimirnthu nilladaa...' or acham enbathu<br />        madamaiyadaa. anjaamai draavidan udamaiyadaa...<br />        after that 90% of the audience could be led by the speaker like a<br />        calf on a tether rope.<br />        also the meeting would be full of words like " anna enna<br />sonnaar?'.<br />        they would keep on repeating that but never tell what anna<br />said till<br />        the end.<br />        venketesh</p>
<p>          I loved the piece where Madan descirbes the "virundhombal"<br />by the<br />        kings to<br />          poets. The clinical crushing of the "Chola pass" theory was<br />        stunning!!</p>
<p>          I feel our replies to such learned people should also be in a<br />        similar vein.<br />          Our emotional outbursts would actually be doing us more harm<br />than<br />        good.<br />          Instead it would be good if our efforts are focussed on proving<br />        Madan wrong<br />          with hard, cold facts. The RRC book might be a good starter.</p>
<p>          Even though Shankar's 23am Pulikesi might have been too comical<br />        looks like<br />          there are certain truths in there. This poet treatment<br />instance is<br />        one.</p>
<p>          Hope all our efforts end up in proving the obvious greatness our<br />        land.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi,<br />  I have been read Madan's reply and counter reply by Sri. Gokul</p></blockquote>
<p>GOKUL ? He has not replied Madan..</p>
<p>It is Kamal @ adithakarikalan of our group. <br />One of the Editors of varalaaru.com team.</p>
<p>Iraiyanbu.IAS asked Madan to write on Tamil Kings (as he has written <br />on Moghuls).</p>
<p>Madan replied the documentation by Tamil Kings is not sufficient to<br />take up such task. Also poets and others flattered more in literature. </p>
<p>This attracted criticism..</p>
<p>Kamal, in varalaaru.com brought out an article highlighting enough<br />materials made avl already by Sastri &amp; Pandrathar and others. </p>
<p>Madan appreciated the effort to bring historical details under a .com<br />- named as varalaaru.com for reference. He also referred the same <br />Scholars and mentioned that these details are not sufficient to carry <br />on a work.</p>
<p>Re Cholapass, our Dear Venkat brought out a version that it was 200 yr<br />old Tibetian word.</p>
<p>I already posted that there is mention of these in Periyapurnam. . </p>
<p>Some of of us in our Group already commenced woprks on RRC History.. <br />and will be needing support of other scholarly members...</p>
<p>We will fullfil IAS Iraiyanbu's wish.. to the best of our ability ourself. </p>
<p>sps </p>
<p>and now</p>
<blockquote><p>  by Madan again. I think Madan is right from what he is saying, we dont<br />  have "detailed" descriptions or day to day activities as seen in other <br />  emperor's times..to put in madan's words like baburnama.<br />  But we cannot blame the kings for not maintaining a diary. Also we<br />  cannot blame ourselves for not discovering everything as of now. There <br />  are things yet to discover. (Maybe PS/varalaru group can discover<br />  something crucial, who knows)<br />  As of now with the material we have, we can speculate rather than<br />  conclude.<br />  Ragothaman </p>

<p>      Its so factual and bereft of any emotions<br />      which we,<br />        especially those born and bought up in the deccan plateau, are so <br />      guilty of.</p>
<p>      Hi rahul<br />      your choice of words and stringing them together is great.<br />      like madan said " unarchi miguthiyaal ennai thaakki irukkiraarkal" <br />      if you noticed the article in varalaaru.com and the initial<br />reactions<br />      to it in this group as well as the reactions printed in <br />varalaaru.com<br />      are full of emotions.</p>
<p>      it reminds me of a typical dravidian election party meeting. the <br />      standard formula was to start meeting with " thamilan endru<br />      solladaa, thalai nimirnthu nilladaa...' or acham enbathu<br />      madamaiyadaa. anjaamai draavidan udamaiyadaa. .. <br />      after that 90% of the audience could be led by the speaker like a<br />      calf on a tether rope.<br />      also the meeting would be full of words like " anna enna sonnaar?'.<br />      they would keep on repeating that but never tell what anna said till<br />      the end.<br />      venketesh</p>
<p>        I loved the piece where Madan descirbes the "virundhombal" by the <br />      kings to<br />        poets. The clinical crushing of the "Chola pass" theory was<br />      stunning!!</p>
<p>        I feel our replies to such learned people should also be in a <br />      similar vein.<br />        Our emotional outbursts would actually be doing us more harm than<br />      good.<br />        Instead it would be good if our efforts are focussed on proving <br />      Madan wrong<br />        with hard, cold facts. The RRC book might be a good starter.</p>
<p>        Even though Shankar's 23am Pulikesi might have been too comical <br />      looks like<br />        there are certain truths in there. This poet treatment instance is<br />      one.</p>
<p>        Hope all our efforts end up in proving the obvious greatness our <br />      land.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I read Madan's Vandargal vendrargal. very gud.<br />I read Ragavan's articles on Arab countries. very gud.</p>
<p>We study in school Ashokar, Chandraguptar.etc. Do you say all are <br />becoase of their diary? Cleopatara - Antonoy - Julius Caeser all <br />having diary?</p>
<p>If they had diary, (recorded their day-to-day matters) Madan is right.<br />If it is written from various sources, Madan or some one else should <br />try seriously to write Chera - Chola - Pandya History.. I want to know <br />about Sangam Kings also.</p>

<p>        Hi,<br />        I have been read Madan's reply and counter reply by Sri. Gokul</p>
<p>      GOKUL ? He has not replied Madan..</p>
<p>      It is Kamal @ adithakarikalan of our group.<br />      One of the Editors of varalaaru.com team.</p>
<p>      Iraiyanbu.IAS asked Madan to write on Tamil Kings (as he has <br />written<br />      on Moghuls).</p>
<p>      Madan replied the documentation by Tamil Kings is not <br />sufficient to<br />      take up such task. Also poets and others flattered more in <br />literature.</p>
<p>      This attracted criticism..</p>
<p>      Kamal, in varalaaru.com brought out an article highlighting <br />enough<br />      materials made avl already by Sastri &amp; Pandrathar and others.</p>
<p>      Madan appreciated the effort to bring historical details under <br />a .com<br />      - named as varalaaru.com for reference. He also referred the <br />same<br />      Scholars and mentioned that these details are not sufficient to <br />carry<br />      on a work.</p>
<p>      Re Cholapass, our Dear Venkat brought out a version that it was <br />200 yr<br />      old Tibetian word.</p>
<p>      I already posted that there is mention of these in <br />Periyapurnam..</p>
<p>      Some of of us in our Group already commenced woprks on RRC <br />History..<br />      and will be needing support of other scholarly members...</p>
<p>      We will fullfil IAS Iraiyanbu's wish.. to the best of our <br />ability<br />      ourself.</p>
<p>      sps</p>
<p>      and now<br />        by Madan again. I think Madan is right from what he is <br />saying, we dont<br />        have "detailed" descriptions or day to day activities as seen <br />in other</p>
<p>        emperor's times..to put in madan's words like baburnama.<br />        But we cannot blame the kings for not maintaining a diary. <br />Also we<br />        cannot blame ourselves for not discovering everything as of <br />now. There</p>
<p>        are things yet to discover. (Maybe PS/varalaru group can <br />discover<br />        something crucial, who knows)<br />        As of now with the material we have, we can speculate rather <br />than<br />        conclude.<br />        Ragothaman</p>

<p>            Hi rahul<br />            your choice of words and stringing them together is great.<br />            like madan said " unarchi miguthiyaal ennai thaakki <br />irukkiraarkal"</p>
<p>            if you noticed the article in varalaaru.com and the <br />initial<br />      reactions<br />            to it in this group as well as the reactions printed in<br />      varalaaru.com<br />            are full of emotions.</p>
<p>            it reminds me of a typical dravidian election party <br />meeting. the<br />            standard formula was to start meeting with " thamilan <br />endru<br />            solladaa, thalai nimirnthu nilladaa...' or acham enbathu<br />            madamaiyadaa. anjaamai draavidan udamaiyadaa...<br />            after that 90% of the audience could be led by the <br />speaker like a<br />            calf on a tether rope.<br />            also the meeting would be full of words like " anna enna<br />      sonnaar?'.<br />            they would keep on repeating that but never tell what <br />anna said<br />      till<br />            the end.<br />            venketesh</p>
<p>              I loved the piece where Madan descirbes the <br />"virundhombal" by<br />      the<br />            kings to<br />              poets. The clinical crushing of the "Chola pass" theory <br />was<br />            stunning!!</p>
<p>              I feel our replies to such learned people should also <br />be in a<br />            similar vein.<br />              Our emotional outbursts would actually be doing us more <br />harm<br />      than<br />            good.<br />              Instead it would be good if our efforts are focussed on <br />proving<br />            Madan wrong<br />              with hard, cold facts. The RRC book might be a good <br />starter.</p>
<p>              Even though Shankar's 23am Pulikesi might have been too <br />comical<br />            looks like<br />              there are certain truths in there. This poet treatment <br />instance<br />      is<br />            one.</p>
<p>              Hope all our efforts end up in proving the obvious <br />greatness our</p>

<p>          Hi rahul<br />          your choice of words and stringing them together is great.<br />          like madan said " unarchi miguthiyaal ennai thaakki irukkiraarkal"</p>
<p>          if you noticed the article in varalaaru.com and the initial<br />    reactions<br />          to it in this group as well as the reactions printed in<br />    varalaaru.com<br />          are full of emotions.</p>
<p>          it reminds me of a typical dravidian election party meeting. the<br />          standard formula was to start meeting with " thamilan endru<br />          solladaa, thalai nimirnthu nilladaa...' or acham enbathu<br />          madamaiyadaa. anjaamai draavidan udamaiyadaa...<br />          after that 90% of the audience could be led by the speaker like a<br />          calf on a tether rope.<br />          also the meeting would be full of words like " anna enna<br />    sonnaar?'.<br />          they would keep on repeating that but never tell what anna said<br />    till<br />          the end.<br />          venketesh</p>
<p>            I loved the piece where Madan descirbes the "virundhombal" by<br />    the<br />          kings to<br />            poets. The clinical crushing of the "Chola pass" theory was<br />          stunning!!</p>
<p>            I feel our replies to such learned people should also be in a<br />          similar vein.<br />            Our emotional outbursts would actually be doing us more harm<br />    than<br />          good.<br />            Instead it would be good if our efforts are focussed on proving<br />          Madan wrong<br />            with hard, cold facts. The RRC book might be a good starter.</p>
<p>            Even though Shankar's 23am Pulikesi might have been too comical<br />          looks like<br />            there are certain truths in there. This poet treatment instance<br />    is<br />          one.</p>
<p>            Hope all our efforts end up in proving the obvious greatness our</p>
<p>          land.</p>

<p>                hi all</p>
<p>                madan has answered to kamal's "bagiranga kaditham."</p>
<p>                4 pages ( which i think is more than what that letter<br />    deserved)</p>
<p>                I request you all to read it with an open mind.</p>
<p>                he has systematically defended himself and broken kamal's<br />          theories .</p>
<p>                regards<br />                venketesh<br />                the subtle message to varalaaru.com in madans letter was<br />    what<br />          all<br />              our<br />                teachers used to tell us in school " do your home work<br />    properly"</p>

<p>        it reminds me of a typical dravidian election party meeting. the<br />        standard formula was to start meeting with " thamilan endru<br />        solladaa, thalai nimirnthu nilladaa...' or acham enbathu<br />        madamaiyadaa. anjaamai draavidan udamaiyadaa...<br />        after that 90% of the audience could be led by the speaker like a<br />        calf on a tether rope.<br />        also the meeting would be full of words like " anna enna sonnaar?'.<br />        they would keep on repeating that but never tell what anna said till<br />        the end.<br />        venketesh</p>
<p>          I loved the piece where Madan descirbes the "virundhombal" by the<br />        kings to<br />          poets. The clinical crushing of the "Chola pass" theory was<br />        stunning!!</p>
<p>          I feel our replies to such learned people should also be in a<br />        similar vein.<br />          Our emotional outbursts would actually be doing us more harm than<br />        good.<br />          Instead it would be good if our efforts are focussed on proving<br />        Madan wrong<br />          with hard, cold facts. The RRC book might be a good starter.</p>
<p>          Even though Shankar's 23am Pulikesi might have been too comical<br />        looks like<br />          there are certain truths in there. This poet treatment instance is<br />        one.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi,<br />  I have been read Madan's reply and counter reply by Sri. Gokul</p></blockquote>
<p>GOKUL ? He has not replied Madan..</p>
<p>It is Kamal @ adithakarikalan of our group.  <br />One of the Editors of varalaaru.com team.</p>
<p>Iraiyanbu.IAS asked Madan to write on Tamil Kings (as he has written<br />on Moghuls).</p>
<p>Madan replied the documentation by Tamil Kings is not sufficient to<br />take up such task. Also poets and others flattered more in literature.</p>
<p>This attracted criticism..</p>
<p>Kamal, in varalaaru.com brought out an article highlighting enough<br />materials made avl already by Sastri &amp; Pandrathar and others.</p>
<p>Madan appreciated the effort to bring historical details under a .com<br />- named as varalaaru.com for reference. He also referred the same<br />Scholars and mentioned that these details are not sufficient to carry<br />on a work.</p>
<p>Re Cholapass, our Dear Venkat brought out a version that it was 200 yr<br />old Tibetian word.</p>
<p>I already posted that there is mention of these in Periyapurnam..</p>
<p>Some of of us in our Group already commenced woprks on RRC History..<br />and will be needing support of other scholarly members...</p>
<p>We will fullfil IAS Iraiyanbu's wish.. to the best of our ability ourself.</p>
<p>sps</p>
<p>and now</p>
<blockquote><p>  by Madan again. I think Madan is right from what he is saying, we dont<br />  have "detailed" descriptions or day to day activities as seen in other<br />  emperor's times..to put in madan's words like baburnama.<br />  But we cannot blame the kings for not maintaining a diary. Also we<br />  cannot blame ourselves for not discovering everything as of now. There<br />  are things yet to discover. (Maybe PS/varalaru group can discover<br />  something crucial, who knows)<br />  As of now with the material we have, we can speculate rather than<br />  conclude.<br />  Ragothaman</p>

<p>  Hi rahul<br />  your choice of words and stringing them together is great.<br />  like madan said " unarchi miguthiyaal ennai thaakki irukkiraarkal"<br />  if you noticed the article in varalaaru.com and the initial reactions<br />  to it in this group as well as the reactions printed in varalaaru.com<br />  are full of emotions.</p>
<p>  it reminds me of a typical dravidian election party meeting. the<br />  standard formula was to start meeting with " thamilan endru<br />  solladaa, thalai nimirnthu nilladaa...' or acham enbathu<br />  madamaiyadaa. anjaamai draavidan udamaiyadaa...<br />  after that 90% of the audience could be led by the speaker like a<br />  calf on a tether rope.<br />  also the meeting would be full of words like " anna enna sonnaar?'.<br />  they would keep on repeating that but never tell what anna said till<br />  the end.<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    I loved the piece where Madan descirbes the "virundhombal" by the<br />  kings to<br />    poets. The clinical crushing of the "Chola pass" theory was<br />  stunning!!</p>
<p>    I feel our replies to such learned people should also be in a<br />  similar vein.<br />    Our emotional outbursts would actually be doing us more harm than<br />  good.<br />    Instead it would be good if our efforts are focussed on proving<br />  Madan wrong<br />    with hard, cold facts. The RRC book might be a good starter.</p>
<p>    Even though Shankar's 23am Pulikesi might have been too comical<br />  looks like<br />    there are certain truths in there. This poet treatment instance is<br />  one.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi</p>
<p>precisely muhilan, if you notice well madan in his first answer had <br />mentioned Ponniyin selvan. he had said with the available info on <br />tamil kings only novels can be written.</p>
<p>emotions are right in fiction reading and writing. and this being a <br />literary group there are quite a few of us who get emotional. but let <br />me tell you a pure line history writer cannot let his creativity or <br />emotions take charge.thats a a job for a novelist or fiction writer.</p>
<p>did you notice how madan quotes his references. he has referred so <br />many books for a fourline answer and takes about a minute to quote <br />them. he doesnt shoot off his words and then run around justifying <br />them. history has to be a science just like physics or chemistry. <br />regards<br />venketesh</p>

<p>Dear Venketesh,</p>
<p>What is the use of reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ? What we have got if we are a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Member. R we going to get any benefits, if we know about <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym ?</p>
<p>If we are mentioning in our appraisal form like <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  reader, <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group member means are we going to get any monetary benefits?</p>
<p>Nothing no?</p>
<p>Then what is the need?</p>
<p>Its giving a good pleasure to us. Pleasure nothing but a kind of Emotion only no? So, nothing wrong in showing our emotions as Kamal has shown in his letter to Madan.</p>
<p>But how we are going to divert our emotions for a better results. </p>
<p>Defineitely I am not going to contribute in the project since I am not a person knowing so many things about our history. But there are several people who are having<br />lot of enthusiasm and knowldge to do. They will make our dream of a book about our tamil kingdoms very soon</p>
<p>Advance congratulations for them.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

          MADAN ANSWERS        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Its so factual and bereft of any emotions <br />which we,</p>
<blockquote><p>  especially those born and bought up in the deccan plateau, are so <br />guilty of.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hi rahul<br />your choice of words and stringing them together is great.<br />like madan said " unarchi miguthiyaal ennai thaakki irukkiraarkal"<br />if you noticed the article in varalaaru.com and the initial reactions <br />to it in this group as well as the reactions printed in varalaaru.com <br />are full of emotions. </p>
<p>it reminds me of a typical dravidian election party meeting. the <br />standard formula was to start meeting with " thamilan endru <br />solladaa, thalai nimirnthu nilladaa...' or acham enbathu <br />madamaiyadaa. anjaamai draavidan udamaiyadaa...<br />after that 90% of the audience could be led by the speaker like a <br />calf on a tether rope.<br />also the meeting would be full of words like " anna enna sonnaar?'. <br />they would keep on repeating that but never tell what anna said till <br />the end. <br />venketesh</p>
<blockquote><p>  I loved the piece where Madan descirbes the "virundhombal" by the <br />kings to<br />  poets. The clinical crushing of the "Chola pass" theory was <br />stunning!!</p>
<p>  I feel our replies to such learned people should also be in a <br />similar vein.<br />  Our emotional outbursts would actually be doing us more harm than <br />good.<br />  Instead it would be good if our efforts are focussed on proving <br />Madan wrong<br />  with hard, cold facts. The RRC book might be a good starter.</p>
<p>  Even though Shankar's 23am Pulikesi might have been too comical <br />looks like<br />  there are certain truths in there. This poet treatment instance is <br />one.</p>
<p>  Hope all our efforts end up in proving the obvious greatness our <br />land.</p>
