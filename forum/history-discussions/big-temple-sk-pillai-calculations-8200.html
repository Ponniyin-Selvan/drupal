</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi Madhu,</p>
<p>Since you have directly gone into the topic - re yandum &amp; aandum - <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of clarifications will help others too.. </p>
<p>Let me attempt ::<br />Whatis india.com states: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/introduction.html" title="http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/introduction.html">http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume...</a></p>
<p>Preface whatis india :: Inscriptions of Southern India were begun to be collected systematically by Professor Hultzsch from the latter part of 1886 when he was appointed Epigraphist to the Government of Madras. The Publication of these documents with texts and translations was taken up simultaneously and the following fasciculi of South Indian Inscriptions were issued between the years 1886 and 1903 : - Volume I ; Volume II - Parts i to iii; andVolume III - Parts i and ii. They include 321 records edited critically and supply all the material that may be practically be found necessary for constructing the rough outlines of Chola and Pallava history. In the year 1909, the later Mr. V. Venkayya, M.A., Rai Bahadur, Epigraphist to the Government of India, volunteered his services to continue the work of Professor Hultzsch and printed in Volume II, Part iv, such of the inscriptions of theBrihadisvara temple at Tanjore, as had not been published already in Partsi to iii of that volume... "</p>
<p>In Introduction, whatis india states :: "It is not necessary to give a detailed account to how the date of accession of Rajarajadeva has been arrived at. Professor Kielhorn has examined a number of dates of the king with astronomical details and has come to the conclusion that his accession took place between the 25th June and 25th July 985 A.D. "</p>
<p>these dates were subsequently debated.</p>
<p>Venkayya was heading the Indian side when big temple inscriptions were published.  </p>
<p>Apart from LOGICAL ARITHMATICAL CALCULATIONS, comparing the data with Astronomical data base was done by one ( Rao Bahadur ) L Swamikkannu Pilliai .. based on "Panchangams " .. 1000 yr old panchangams were workedout...</p>
<p>If an inscription says : "abarapatsha mesha gnayitru .. suryagrahanam " SOLAR ECLIPSE in the month Mesha - post New moon - Sunday .. <br />For example : such data avl on 977 oct 12th..<br />1010 Sept 29th...</p>
<p>But the King in question is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .. so 1010 sept 29th fits " (likewise)</p>
<p>Kubakonam Raman &amp; Raman Bus Owner (which became Cholan tranport later) N Sethuraman took interest in these studies and analysed most of the dates based on these data... there are certain discrepancies ::</p>
<p>Widely accepted that 969 <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym expired. But he says this happened about 5 years earlier..  </p>
<p>Likewise though there are discrepancies, re <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's ascendancy, karakadaga Punarvasu was fixed... and thus 25.6.985 was not agreed upon.</p>
<p>Re Yandu and Anndu - Sethuraman has come out with an isolated explanation stating :: Aandu goes with Calender year... ( Say Maharathil Ravi - Sankaranthi - from Tamil month Thai).</p>
<p>Re yaandu - since Regnal year of King commences from his date of ascendancy, Aandu and Yandu does not go together... and hence inscriptions specified:: " Swasthishree korajakesari panmarrkku YAANDU .. ( 2 vathu .. 3 vathu... etc).. which means the date or year to be taken from the date of Crowning and NOT from Thai First !!</p>
<p>This he clarified with certain case studies of Uthama !!</p>
<p>Let me leave it here..</p>
<p>But the Astronomical Studies and comparing the dates ENDED with SwamikkannuPillai and no one else continues this ... </p>
<p>Hence "Hail SK Pillai " !!</p>
<p>When spoke to Dr. Kalaikkovan some time back, he advised certain details can be had from St. Joseph College Library, Trichy... but myself could not persue ..</p>
<p>Tail Piece :: through the son and wife of (Late) Kudanthai sethuraman (who is now in USA) trying to get the working sheets supported the theories of Sethuraman ... very very beginning stage.</p>

<blockquote><p>  SPS uncle, I tried to understand N.Sethuraman's "Yandum - Indian type kala kanakeedum"? but it was very hard to me. I can fix Oracle 6i forms and reports problem easier than this calculations. Kheilharn and SK Pillai and N.Sethuraman calculates the date of coronation from Udayarkudi inscriptions. Yandu 3, Karkadaga Madham, Tiruvathirai star. Saturday . As he says the date falls on July 14th 988AD. He mixes with Konerirajapuram inscriptions and arrives at July 18th 985 AD as the date of Rajarajan coming to throne. <br />  ??? Is there any other forumula or method for fixing the dates mentioned in inscriptions?? We have to make 'Sashtanga namaskaram'? and surrender without arms to SK Pillai only, is it?<br />  ??? <br />  ? My id is having the No. 85......it is my birth year (DOB 21.1.1985) Iwill be returning backto India in Jan.2010 and I want to meet you uncle and all.

<p>Briefly, if we have years, given in some common era like Saka or Kali Yuga, we <br />can figure out when it was - Saka refers to the Shalivahana era, which is 78 <br />CE, and Kali Yuga is 3101 (or 3102) BCE. The problem is, our ancestors weren't <br />so helpful as that - maybe they wanted to leave us with some mystery to enrich <br />our lives... Typically, Chola inscriptions don't carry a date from a common <br />era, and instead, they are dated within the king's reign.</p>
<p>To further confuse matters, there's the usual flip-flop title of <br />Parakesarivarman / Rajakesarivarman, and quite a few inscriptions carry these <br />and no other title. So, when we read an inscription that says "In the fourth <br />year of the reign of Parakesarivarman...", we are left wondering which <br />Parakesarivarman it refers to.</p>
<p>Sometimes however, these inscriptions (especially more important ones) also <br />come with a few dozen pieces of astrological information (naal, tithi, <br />nakshatram, and most usefully, eclipses), which we can use to date an event. <br />Certain combinations only occur in certain years, and with even the most basic <br />software of today, it's possible to go back in time and figure out when that <br />configuration of stars, planets and others occurred.</p>
<p>Also, if inscriptions refer to other events, which have been dated, and <br />especially when they've been dated from other places (like say, a conquest of <br />Vengi mentioned in records from the North), we can correlate and say when that <br />was.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the whole thing is an educated guessing game. Maybe if the rest of <br />those thousands of inscriptions that SPS and others mention every so often are <br />translated and published, we can learn more. Maybe some information is totally <br />lost to history - some of it in our own time, thanks to horrible temple <br />"renovation" that our temple administrations undertake...</p>
<p>One ultimate source of these calculations is the Surya Siddantha, which is <br />probably the most important root source from which our Panchangams are <br />calculated. If we look at it as a scientific rather than mystical and <br />astrological text, we could probably understand a whole lot more.</p>

<p>    Since you have directly gone into the topic - re yandum &amp; aandum - bit of clarifications will help others too.. </p>
<p>    Let me attempt ::<br />    Whatis india.com states: </p>
<p>    <a href="http://www.whatisin" title="http://www.whatisin">http://www.whatisin</a> dia.com/inscript ions/south_ indian_inscripti ons/volume_ 2/introduction. html</p>
<p>    Preface whatis india :: Inscriptions of Southern India were begun to becollected systematically by Professor Hultzsch from the latter part of 1886 when he was appointed Epigraphist to the Government of Madras. The Publication of these documents with texts and translations was taken up simultaneously and the following fasciculi of South Indian Inscriptions were issued between the years 1886 and 1903 : - Volume I ; Volume II - Parts i to iii; and Volume III - Parts i and ii. They include 321 records edited criticallyand supply all the material that may be practically be found necessary forconstructing the rough outlines of Chola and Pallava history. In the year 1909, the later Mr. V. Venkayya, M.A., Rai Bahadur, Epigraphist to the Government of India, volunteered his services to continue the work of ProfessorHultzsch and printed in Volume II, Part iv, such of the inscriptions of the Brihadisvara temple at Tanjore, as had not been published already in<br />    Parts i to iii of that volume... "</p>
<p>    In Introduction, whatis india states :: "It is not necessary to give a detailed account to how the date of accession of Rajarajadeva has been arrived at. Professor Kielhorn has examined a number of dates of the king with astronomical details and has come to the conclusion that his accession tookplace between the 25th June and 25th July 985 A.D. "</p>
<p>    these dates were subsequently debated.</p>
<p>    Venkayya was heading the Indian side when big temple inscriptions were published. </p>
<p>    Apart from LOGICAL ARITHMATICAL CALCULATIONS, comparing the data with Astronomical data base was done by one ( Rao Bahadur ) L Swamikkannu Pilliai.. based on "Panchangams " .. 1000 yr old panchangams were workedout...</p>
<p>    If an inscription says : "abarapatsha mesha gnayitru .. suryagrahanam "SOLAR ECLIPSE in the month Mesha - post New moon - Sunday .. <br />    For example : such data avl on 977 oct 12th..<br />    1010 Sept 29th...</p>
<p>    But the King in question is RRC.. so 1010 sept 29th fits " (likewise)</p>
<p>    Kubakonam Raman &amp; Raman Bus Owner (which became Cholan tranport later) N Sethuraman took interest in these studies and analysed most of the dates based on these data... there are certain discrepancies ::</p>
<p>    Widely accepted that 969 AK expired. But he says this happened about 5 years earlier.. </p>
<p>    Likewise though there are discrepancies, re RRC's ascendancy, karakadaga Punarvasu was fixed... and thus 25.6.985 was not agreed upon.</p>
<p>    Re Yandu and Anndu - Sethuraman has come out with an isolated explanation stating :: Aandu goes with Calender year... ( Say Maharathil Ravi - Sankaranthi - from Tamil month Thai).</p>
<p>    Re yaandu - since Regnal year of King commences from his date of ascendancy, Aandu and Yandu does not go together... and hence inscriptions specified :: " Swasthishree korajakesari panmarrkku YAANDU .. ( 2 vathu .. 3 vathu... etc).. which means the date or year to be taken from the date of Crowning and NOT from Thai First !!</p>
<p>    This he clarified with certain case studies of Uthama !!</p>
<p>    Let me leave it here..</p>
<p>    But the Astronomical Studies and comparing the dates ENDED with Swamikkannu Pillai and no one else continues this ... </p>
<p>    Hence "Hail SK Pillai " !!</p>
<p>    When spoke to Dr. Kalaikkovan some time back, he advised certain details can be had from St. Joseph College Library, Trichy... but myself could not persue ..</p>
<p>    Tail Piece :: through the son and wife of (Late) Kudanthai sethuraman (who is now in USA) trying to get the working sheets supported the theories of Sethuraman ... very very beginning stage.</p>

        <p>sps wrote on 3.2.2004 ::</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Karuvurar - who composed hymns on Rajarajeswara and Gangaikonda<br />choleeswara had evidently lived after <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  also. Nambiandarnambi also<br />sang a hymn on GKCpm.Gandradithya calling himself of King of Kori and<br />lord of Thanjai. By these, we realise atleast 3 Thiruvisaippa authors<br />lived prior-during and after <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym .(SI Vol II - Part I &amp; II)</p>
<p>According to Venkaiah, Epigraphist to Indian Government during the<br />British Rule, until his 8th year of reign, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  had not undertaken any<br />expedition.Probably he engaged in recruiting powerful army.</acronym></p>
<p>In his first expedition, he destroyed a fleet in port Kandalur, which<br />belonged to Cheras but co-held by Pandyas. Prior to 1002 he completed<br />most of his conquests. In 1001, the Survey to the accuracy of<br />1/52,420,800,000 of a veli was completed by Ulagalanthan! He had 31<br />regiments. Chozha Mandalam comprised of 9 Valanadus; Tondai nadu<br />comprised of 7; Tondaimandalam : 12; Pandinadu: 7; Melai &amp; Gangapadi:<br />1 each; Nulambapadi @ Nilgiri: 1; Muumudicholam : Ceylon etc : 2; 5<br />Divisions were also there in addition. Between 1002 and 1005 he<br />concentrated on demoestic matters and was not active in war fields.<br />As per Kongudesarajakkal, it may be derived that the Chidambaram<br />temple authorities conferred the title Rajaraja in 1003.<br />According to Hottur inscriptions, Satyasreya died in 1007-08 in the<br />war waged by Rajendra with 900000 (9 lakhs) soldiers- slaughtered<br />women, children, brahmins and taking the girls to wife and destroyed<br />their caste. Upon return he is said to have presented gold flowers<br />to Rajarajeswaramudayar @ peruvudayar!</p>
<p>Wait.. the consecration took place only on the 275th day of the 25th<br />year then how come Rajendra worshipped Peruvudayar two years prior to<br />that? The answer is the construction -in Mahudabaranam style - (ref.<br />my earlier mails)- commcned in the 19th year - reached an advance<br />stage in the 23rd year (gifts recorded from this year onwards) and<br />was consecrated in the 25th year 275 th day!</p>
<p>In RRswm temple, His gifts &amp; those of his sister Kundavai alone<br />recorded on the Northern wall; His wifes' gifts on other walls; then others gifts recorded. Rajendra's gifts on Chandeswara temple<br />etc., Thalicheri details on outer wall of Anukkan voil!</p>
<p>In Devaram &amp; Thiruvisaippa - re: Chidambaram - the first hymn has<br />reference of Adalvallan, which is the name of the chief image in<br />Rajarajeswaram also. Meruvidankan is similarity of Kailash. It was<br />believed that Mount meru consisted of Gold. Hence Chidambaram was<br />gold covered...However, the author does not discuss the Golden<br />roofing possibility of Big Temple.. (Ref. Kudavoil details also).</p>
<p>Above are the excerpts by V.Venkaiah in 1909.</p>
<p>In the Big Temple, we all saw the painting - a person with a beard<br />and a person with a crown. I am beginning to concur with Gokul. The<br />person with beard may be <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  and the crown prince may be Rajendra.<br />Whenever these Kings performed anything orthodox, they grew beard :<br />Thiruvisalur Hinyagarbam - Thiruvalanchuzhi Thila parvatham entry<br />etc. Our Kamal asked me a question yesterday. How do you confirm it<br />is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  or Rajendra? Who else then? - is my answer. On the Northern<br />side entrance of Thiruvalanchuzhi, we have seen Siva in sitting<br />postures followed by several Rishis.. a bearded and crowned person<br />also sit in obedience..One cannot avoid the influence of the monarchs<br />in such art - even whether they like or not. Of course, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  is very<br />methodical in recording most of the events.. </acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>He might have ..Probably<br />he had done so.. As Gokul says, it is a feeling!!</p>
<p>But our Dr. Kalaikkovan has taught us - without concrete evidence do<br />not commit. </p>
<p>In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Group, we are not reserchers.. we speculate..<br />rather enjoy speculations based on certain logics and circumstances...</acronym></p>

<p>      Preface whatis india :: Inscriptions of Southern India were begun to be collected systematically by Professor Hultzsch from the latter part of 1886 when he was appointed Epigraphist to the Government of Madras. The Publication of these documents with texts and translations was taken up simultaneously and the following fasciculi of South Indian Inscriptions were issued between the years 1886 and 1903 : - Volume I ; Volume II - Parts i to iii; and Volume III - Parts i and ii. They include 321 records edited critically and supply all the material that may be practically be found necessaryfor constructing the rough outlines of Chola and Pallava history. In the year 1909, the later Mr. V. Venkayya, M.A., Rai Bahadur, Epigraphist to theGovernment of India, volunteered his services to continue the work of Professor Hultzsch and printed in Volume II, Part iv, such of the inscriptions of the Brihadisvara temple at Tanjore, as had not been published already inParts i to iii of that volume...

<p>SK Pillai's calculations - helped in counter-checking certain details. TheBritish also employed his methodology.</p>
<p>Certain errors were corrected subsequently.</p>
<p>What you said was 25.6.985 was <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  date of ascendancy.</p>

<p>  ? <br />  Hi Madhu,</p>
<p>  Since you have directly gone into the topic - re yandum &amp; aandum - bit ofclarifications will help others too.. </p>
<p>  Let me attempt ::<br />  Whatis india.com states: </p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.whatisin" title="http://www.whatisin">http://www.whatisin</a> dia.com/inscript ions/south_ indian_inscripti ons/volume_ 2/introduction. html</p>
<p>  Preface whatis india :: Inscriptions of Southern India were begun to be collected systematically by Professor Hultzsch from the latter part of 1886 when he was appointed Epigraphist to the Government of Madras. The Publication of these documents with texts and translations was taken up simultaneously and the following fasciculi of South Indian Inscriptions were issued between the years 1886 and 1903 : - Volume I ; Volume II - Parts i to iii; and Volume III - Parts i and ii. They include 321 records edited critically and supply all the material that may be practically be found necessary for constructing the rough outlines of Chola and Pallava history. In the year 1909, the later Mr. V. Venkayya, M.A., Rai Bahadur, Epigraphist to the Government of India, volunteered his services to continue the work of Professor Hultzsch and printed in Volume II, Part iv, such of the inscriptions of the Brihadisvara temple at Tanjore, as had not been published already in<br />  Parts i to iii of that volume... "</p>
<p>  In Introduction, whatis india states :: "It is not necessary to give a detailed account to how the date of accession of Rajarajadeva has been arrived at. Professor Kielhorn has examined a number of dates of the king with astronomical details and has come to the conclusion that his accession took place between the 25th June and 25th July 985 A.D. "</p>
<p>  these dates were subsequently debated.</p>
<p>  Venkayya was heading the Indian side when big temple inscriptions were published. </p>
<p>  Apart from LOGICAL ARITHMATICAL CALCULATIONS, comparing the data with Astronomical data base was done by one ( Rao Bahadur ) L Swamikkannu Pilliai .. based on "Panchangams " .. 1000 yr old panchangams were workedout...</p>
<p>  If an inscription says : "abarapatsha mesha gnayitru .. suryagrahanam " SOLAR ECLIPSE in the month Mesha - post New moon - Sunday .. <br />  For example : such data avl on 977 oct 12th..<br />  1010 Sept 29th...</p>
<p>  But the King in question is RRC.. so 1010 sept 29th fits " (likewise)</p>
<p>  Kubakonam Raman &amp; Raman Bus Owner (which became Cholan tranport later) N Sethuraman took interest in these studies and analysed most of the dates based on these data... there are certain discrepancies ::</p>
<p>  Widely accepted that 969 AK expired. But he says this happened about 5 years earlier.. </p>
<p>  Likewise though there are discrepancies, re RRC's ascendancy, karakadaga Punarvasu was fixed... and thus 25.6.985 was not agreed upon.</p>
<p>  Re Yandu and Anndu - Sethuraman has come out with an isolated explanationstating :: Aandu goes with Calender year... ( Say Maharathil Ravi - Sankaranthi - from Tamil month Thai).</p>
<p>  Re yaandu - since Regnal year of King commences from his date of ascendancy, Aandu and Yandu does not go together... and hence inscriptions specified :: " Swasthishree korajakesari panmarrkku YAANDU .. ( 2 vathu .. 3 vathu... etc).. which means the date or year to be taken from the date of Crowning and NOT from Thai First !!</p>
<p>  This he clarified with certain case studies of Uthama !!</p>
<p>  Let me leave it here..</p>
<p>  But the Astronomical Studies and comparing the dates ENDED with Swamikkannu Pillai and no one else continues this ... </p>
<p>  Hence "Hail SK Pillai " !!</p>
<p>  When spoke to Dr. Kalaikkovan some time back, he advised certain details can be had from St. Joseph College Library, Trichy... but myself could not persue ..</p>
<p>  Tail Piece :: through the son and wife of (Late) Kudanthai sethuraman (who is now in USA) trying to get the working sheets supported the theories ofSethuraman ... very very beginning stage.</p>

        <p>Whenever this topic of recording history surfaces, we repeat the same line of thinking - again and again ::</p>
<p>After the British - hardly the inscriptions estamped have been published.</p>
<p>And several estempages lying unattended in the chambers of Mysore / <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym ... till date.</p>
<p>Both the State Governments in succession had completed publishing about 25000 inscriptions in a span of about 3 - 4 years.</p>
<p>And not less than 100000 are yet to be studied and published..</p>
<p>and a good amount is yet to be estempaged..</p>
<p>We have very limited access...</p>
<p>how many of us have gone into what is in net already - say whatisindia.com ?</p>
<p>About 27 volues of South Indian inscriptions - ARE several volumes (gist) Epigraphia Indica - Avanam - Varalaaru - private collections (like whole series of Thiruvarur inscriptions published by Kudavoil)who has really gone into ?</p>
<p>There are about 150 books avl on Cholas alone - in Vridhachalam Library...</p>
<p>So it is not that the Kings have manipulated their History..</p>
<p>Meykeerthi alone does not form part of History...</p>
<p>Those who told Rajendra's going North was Theertha Yathirai have to keep silent when newer inscriptions unfolded...</p>
<p>Kedah @ Kadaram inscriptions threw more light recently..</p>
<p>with very limited resources these things are brought up .. and hardl any Government support..</p>
<p>We are not able to putforth behind-the-screnes valndalisms too openly in discussion..</p>
<p>Let us first get to know from what is avaiable.</p>

        <p>Hi All<br />it should be very valid for us all to read the histories of kings and events contemprory to <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  thro out the world.<br />that would tell us how behind we are in recording the history of our kings<br />we cant decide when <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was born, we dont know for sure when he died or where he was buried.<br />dont know much of his great battles, their locations, their dates, the enemies and details<br />i would never forget the time a historian told me '<acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's death is calculated from the date of the last inscription found in his name.'<br />sometimes i feel there wasnt enough of our south indian history recorded for the british to onclude it in texts. most were generalisations and assumptions. and we complain that the south was ignored when the history was written.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>

The Publication of these documents with texts and translations was taken up simultaneously and the following fasciculi of South Indian Inscriptions were issued between the years 1886 and 1903 : - Volume I ; Volume II - Parts i to iii; and Volume III - Parts i and ii. They include 321 records edited critically and supply all the material that may be practically be found necessary for constructing the rough outlines of Chola and Pallava history. In the year 1909, the later Mr. V. Venkayya, M.A., Rai Bahadur, Epigraphist to the Government of India, volunteered his services to continue the work of Professor Hultzsch and printed in Volume II, Part iv, such of the inscriptions of the Brihadisvara temple at Tanjore, as had not been published already in<br />  Parts i to iii of that volume...

<p>  Re Yandu and Anndu - Sethuraman has come out with an isolated explanationstating :: Aandu goes with Calender year... ( Say Maharathil Ravi - Sankaranthi - from Tamil month Thai).</p>
<p>  Re yaandu - since Regnal year of King commences from his date of ascendancy, Aandu and Yandu does not go together... and hence inscriptions specified :: " Swasthishree korajakesari panmarrkku YAANDU .. ( 2 vathu .. 3 vathu... etc).. which means the date or year to be taken from the date of Crowning and NOT from Thai First !!</p>
<p>  This he clarified with certain case studies of Uthama !!</p>
<p>  Let me leave it here..</p>
<p>  But the Astronomical Studies and comparing the dates ENDED with Swamikkannu Pillai and no one else continues this ... </p>
<p>  Hence "Hail SK Pillai " !!</p>
<p>  When spoke to Dr. Kalaikkovan some time back, he advised certain details can be had from St. Joseph College Library, Trichy... but myself could not persue ..</p>
<p>  Tail Piece :: through the son and wife of (Late) Kudanthai sethuraman (who is now in USA) trying to get the working sheets supported the theories ofSethuraman ... very very beginning stage.</p>

<p>    SPS uncle, I tried to understand N.Sethuraman's "Yandum - Indian type kala kanakeedum"? but it was very hard to me. I can fix Oracle 6i forms and reports problem easier than this calculations. Kheilharn and SK Pillai and N.Sethuraman calculates the date of coronation from Udayarkudi inscriptions. Yandu 3, Karkadaga Madham, Tiruvathirai star. Saturday . As he says thedate falls on July 14th 988AD. He mixes with Konerirajapuram inscriptions and arrives at July 18th 985 AD as the date of Rajarajan coming to throne. <br />    ??? Is there any other forumula or method for fixing the dates mentioned in inscriptions?? We have to make 'Sashtanga namaskaram'? and surrender without arms to SK Pillai only, is it?<br />    ??? <br />    ? My id is having the No. 85......it is my birth year (DOB 21.1.1985)I will be returning backto India in Jan.2010 and I want to meet you uncle and all. Already I have missed the Aug 15th Meet.<br />    Madhu</p>
