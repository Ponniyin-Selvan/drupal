</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi<br />in today ananda vikadan's question naswer by madan ( page 116) there <br />is a very thought provoking set of kelvi pathil</p>
<p>irai anbu ias has asked madan why he cant write a parallel to " <br />vanthaarkal vendraarkal" with chola history.<br />madan explains thaty most of our history was unfortunately written by <br />poets. with liberal doses of liqour and prizes they have enhanced the <br />glory.<br />he quotes the example of chola kings who supposedly went to the <br />himalayas and says such kings perhaps never crossed telugu land.<br />since those words come from an expert on indian history (not only has <br />his book vanthaarkal vendraarkaL sold record volumes but also pulled <br />a lot of people into reading history as a past time.)we need to think <br />on them.</p>

        <p>Sometimes Madan himself was stupid as he said Y2K is<br />roman number when some reader asked about Y2K during<br />1998-99. Actually its Year 2000(Year 2 Kilo and<br />Kilo=1000 in Greek).</p>
<p>Its Buddhi Thadumatram(Mind confusion).</p>
<p>Chola empire was proven thing and many many historians<br />acknowledged that.</p>
<p>Madan made such blabberings though he born/raised in<br />Thanjavur itself, he seen the big temple everyday and<br />Kallanai was near to him before he arrived Chennai.</p>
<p>Even today if he travels to Thanjavur/Kumbakonam, he<br />can not be missed seeing Gangaikonda Cholapuram.</p>
<p>So definitely his mind confused.</p>

We do have very ancient sites<br />  like the one near Gummidipoondi, Dr. Sirimoney's<br />  works point to lots of Iron age settlements and what<br />  not. Credible evidence is something everyone keeps<br />  asking about, do we know when we would have actually<br />  had Karikalan rule over the chola kingdom, no dates,<br />  we will not be able to come up with that. </snandaakumar@yahoo.co.in></p>
<p>  Unquestionable evidence makes everyone stand up and<br />  take notice, that is something that we need to<br />  ponder about. Chola pass could be a mis-nomer just<br />  like the Cholula Indians(do we have common linkages<br />  here?) Or is that the Cholas are Persians in origin?<br />  I thought the Pallavas have been thought to be of<br />  Persianic in origin. Ohh.. so what we thought is not<br />  what was actually there???? Ohhh my, I am feeling<br />  like I am in the movie Matrix..</p>
<p>  I am with the group, for sending Kamal's rejoinder<br />  to Madan. Vaazhaga Kamal. But sanity tells me to<br />  understand the scenario around Madan's comments to a<br />  question. Are we talking like our politicians, just<br />  trying to make hue and cry without actually<br />  understanding the situation and the cause for the<br />  statement.??</p>
<p>  Sorry if I am hurting anyone's sentiment in this<br />  email.</p>
<p>  History in oral tradition, like our poems, folk<br />  songs are just a reminder of our past, but in the<br />  eyes of historians they are not credible evidence,<br />  maybe they can be used as Corollary to the actual<br />  stuff to reconstruct whatever missing information<br />  that is needed to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>    is today's ananda vikadan available on the net.</p>
<p>    can someone give a link to it.</p>
<p>    madan is very forceful when he says writing a<br />  historical book on the <br />    muvendar is just not worth it. he quotes ponniyin<br />  selvan's name and <br />    says only fiction is posible.<br />    coming from another man its different.<br />    but madan is an aknowledged expert who brought<br />  history to the common <br />    man.</p>

        <p>Hi Sri,</p>
<p>Yes, but what was the atcual question put forth to Madan? Was it the later Muvendars? Then Cheras are not point to mention here, as it was Ay Kings inMalabar at that time. </p>
<p>Early muvendars, we have only literary proof, which needs to be taken with a pinch of salt and as rightly what Kamal points filter off the chaff from the actual acheivements and locate underlying historical event. Chronology has been difficult in pin-pointing the period and age to which a king couldbe pointed to. </p>

<p>we are not belittling our kings. just complaining the recording of <br />history wasnt all that efficient.</p>
<p>not even comparable to same periods in european history.<br />I always quote the bayeux tapestry which relates like a cartoon the <br />story of the battle of hastings in 1066. half a century behind the <br />cholas.it was possibly completed by 1077<br />its a cloth 20 inches wide and 230 feet long. thats 70 metres.<br />its embroided with scenes from the norman invasion of england.<br />it gives minute details( there is a halley's comet in the back ground <br />sky).you cant have more details surviving from that period and even <br />that in cloth.<br />please check this out in wikipedia.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Looking at Mrs. Kalavathy's response and I am with her in this controversy.I have no doubts that as a society we are as old as humanity is, but credible evidence does not seem to be showing up for the period before 100BC. Wedo have very ancient sites like the one near Gummidipoondi, Dr. Sirimoney's works point to lots of Iron age settlements and what not. Credible evidence is something everyone keeps asking about, do we know when we would have actually had Karikalan rule over the chola kingdom, no dates, we will not be able to come up with that. </p>
<p>Unquestionable evidence makes everyone stand up and take notice, that is something that we need to ponder about. Chola pass could be a mis-nomer just like the Cholula Indians(do we have common linkages here?) Or is that the Cholas are Persians in origin? I thought the Pallavas have been thought to be of Persianic in origin. Ohh.. so what we thought is not what was actuallythere???? Ohhh my, I am feeling like I am in the movie Matrix..</p>
<p>I am with the group, for sending Kamal's rejoinder to Madan. Vaazhaga Kamal. But sanity tells me to understand the scenario around Madan's comments toa question. Are we talking like our politicians, just trying to make hue and cry without actually understanding the situation and the cause for the statement.??</p>
<p>Sorry if I am hurting anyone's sentiment in this email.</p>
<p>History in oral tradition, like our poems, folk songs are just a reminder of our past, but in the eyes of historians they are not credible evidence, maybe they can be used as Corollary to the actual stuff to reconstruct whatever missing information that is needed to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>dear friends,<br />what i understand of madan's reply is..;he says that south indian history has not been recorded properly.so if i write it will not be authentic.i can not supplement it with facts.'vanthaarkal vendaarkal' had enough text to write historically. "...even i feel the same.but for a few culverts and inscriptions and some poems we do not have any record to prove the war and rule.myself and karthik had often discussed this point.we had an ambition to direct a movie like the 'lord of the rings' and another movie which was in theoffing,i do not remember the name[where 1000 elephants were brought in onescene, and the shower of arrows]...http: //vijayanagar. blogspot. com/....july 2005 archive ....<br />these two movies were real mammoth achievement. .though karthik's dream was shocking,,,yet we discussed the possibilities. .then wefelt that we do not have enough hoistorical books to base the work upon.<br />....this is what Madhan says.not that he under estimates our chola dynasty or that he does not respect them.his reply is misunderstood.<br />anbudan,<br />karthik amma</p>

<p>Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>There is evidence that a Pass in the Himalayas is named as (Karikala) <br />CHOZHA PASS and thus known till date.</p>
<p>There is evidence that Rajendra's Army crossed Godhavari and indeed <br />went to Ganges .. Rajendra's army missed Allaudin when he diverted to <br />Somnathpur. Respected Member SK Pillai sought for details earlier and <br />we have furnished in our Group.</p>
<p>All the more reason why True History is to be brought to light.. and <br />need for our Web-site too ..</p>

<p>THANK YOU KARTHIK. WE HAVE SIVARAM, MADAN. CHANDRA AND OTHERS <br />ALREADY SHOWED INTEREST. WE WILL WORK AS A TEAM. NICE OF YOU.</p>

<p>    I have been following this gp for past 6 months and amount info i<br />  got from this gp is amazing.But i feel if all these details have <br />been<br />  collected in some format it will be wonderful.We have some amazing<br />  people like Dr Jayabee etc in this gp.</p>

<p>  You people have to make an archive of PS in another <br />  website.<br />  Never trust free benefits by Global Corporates of the <br />  U.S. <br />  There were several groups and web-sites where writers <br />  were encouraged to post their writing. <br />  If anyone reads the writing, it makes a hit. <br />  Every hit was worth so many cents. Some hits cost a few <br />  dollars. Many writer were making good money. <br />  There were also rackets going. Something like what we <br />  see among the Tamil Bloggers.<br />  At the end of the month, the total was calculated <br />  and paid to the writer.<br />  Thousands of writers were contributing. <br />  One day, the web-site was sold to some party. Access <br />  was forbidden.<br />  All the writings were taken by the new owners. <br />  I lost two beautiful short stories.</p>
<p>  So.....<br />  Better to create separate archives.</p>
<p>  I have some observations to make about PS.<br />  You see, I have been around in the Web for 10 years. <br />  I have written 10000 plus postings and inputs in more <br />  than 100 groups and forums.<br />  My observations are made from long experience.</p>
<p>  But some of the observations might make you angry.</p>
<p>  But it will throw a light on weaknesses and improve PS. </p>

        <p>Hi<br />computer guys</p>
<p>is today's ananda vikadan available on the net.</p>
<p>can someone give a link to it.</p>
<p>madan is very forceful when he says writing a historical book on the <br />muvendar is just not worth it. he quotes ponniyin selvan's name and <br />says only fiction is posible.<br />coming from another man its different.<br />but madan is an aknowledged expert who brought history to the common <br />man.</p>
<p>I guess experts in the group who think otherwise should give him a <br />rejoinder and that too quickly. so it can be published next week</p>

<p>S.balasibramani B+ Bhubaneswar orissa</p>
<p>Hathigumpha Inscription of Kharavela of Kalinga</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(Line 1) Salutation to the Arhats (Arihats = <br />lit. 'Conquerors of Enemies,' i.e., Jinas). Salutation to all the <br />Siddhas. By illustrious Kharavela, the Aira (Aila), the Great King, <br />the descendant of Mahameghavahana, the increaser (of the glory) of <br />the Cheti (Chedi) dynasty, (endowed) with excellent and auspicious <br />marks and features, possessed of virtues which have reached (the <br />ends of) the four quarters, overlord of Kalinga,<br />(L. 2) for fifteen years, with a body ruddy and handsome <br />were played youthsome sport; after that (by him who) had mastered <br />(royal) correspondence, currency, finance, civil and religious laws <br />(and) who had become well-versed in all (branches) of learning, for <br />nine years (the office of) Yuvaraja (heir apparent) was <br />administered. Having completed the twenty-fourth year, at that time, <br />(he) who had been prosperous (vardhamana) since his infancy (?) and <br />who (was destined) to have wide conquests as those of Vena,<br />(L. 3) then in the state of manhood, obtains the imperial <br />(maharajya) coronation in the dynasty of Kalinga. As soon as he is <br />anointed, in the first (regnal) year (he) causes repairs of the <br />gates, the walls and the buildings (of the city), (which had been) <br />damaged by storm; in the city of Kalinga (he) causes the erection of <br />the embankments of the lake (called after) Khibira Rishi, (and) of <br />(other) tanks and cisterns, (also) the restoration of all the <br />gardens (he) causes to be<br />(L. 4) done at (the cost of) thirty-five-hundred-thousands, <br />and (he) gratifies the People. And in the second year (he), <br />disregarding Satakamini, despatches to the western regions an army <br />strong in cavalry, elephants, infantry (nara) and chariots (ratha) <br />and by that army having reached the Kanha-bemna, he throws the city <br />of the Musikas into consternation. Again in the third year,<br />(L. 5) (he) versed in the science of the Gandharvas (i.e., <br />music), entertains the capital with the exhibition of dapa, dancing, <br />singing and instrumental music and by causing to be held festivities <br />and assemblies (samajas); similarly in the fourth year, 'the Abode <br />of Vidyadharas' built by the former Kalingan king(s), which had not <br />been damaged before ???..................... with their coronets <br />rendered meaningless, with their helmets (?) (bilma) cut in twain <br />(?), and with their umbrellas and<br />(L. 6) bhingaras cast away, deprived of their jewels (i.e., <br />ratana, Skt. ratna, precious objects) all the Rathikas and Bhojakas <br />(he) causes to bow down at his feet. Now in the fifth year he brings <br />into the capital from the road of Tansauliya the canal excavated in <br />the year one hundred-and-three of King <br />Nanda ................... ......... Having been (re-)anointed (he <br />while) celebrating the Rajasuya, remits all tithes and cesses,<br />(L. 7) bestows many privileges (amounting to) hundreds of <br />thousands or the City-Corporation and the Realm-Corporation. In the <br />seventh year of his reign, his famous wife of Vajiraghara obtained <br />the dignity of auspicious motherhood ????.Then in the eighth year, <br />(he) with a large army having sacked Goradhagiri<br />(L.8) causes pressure on Rajagaha (Rajagriha). On account of <br />the loud report of this act of valour, the Yavana (Greek) King Dimi<br />[ta] retreated to Mathura having extricated his demoralized army and <br />transport.? ?????.(He) gives?????..with foliage<br />(L. 9) Kalpa (wish-fulfilling) trees, elephants, chariots <br />with their drivers, houses, residences and rest-houses. And to make <br />all these acceptable (he) gives at a fire sacrifice (?) exemption <br />(from taxes) to the caste of Brahmanas. Of <br />Arhat ..................................<br />(L. 10) ..................(He) causes to be built . . . . a <br />royal residence (called) the Palace of Great Victory (Mahavijaya) at <br />the cost of thirty-eight hundred thousands. And in the tenth year <br />(he), following (the three-fold policy) of chastisement, alliance <br />and conciliation sends out an expedition against Bharatavasa (and) <br />brings about the conquest of the land (or, country) ........ and <br />obtains jewels and precious things of the (kings) attacked.</p>
<p>(L.11) .................. And the market-town (?) Pithumda <br />founded by the Ava King he ploughs down with a plough of asses; and <br />(he) thoroughly breaks up the confederacy of the T[r]amira (Dramira) <br />countries of one hundred and thirteen years, which has been a source <br />of danger to (his) Country (Janapada). And in the twelfth year he <br />terrifies the kings of the Utarapathawith thousands of<br />(L.12) .................. And causing panic amongst the <br />people of Magadha (he) drives (his) elephants into the Sugamgiya <br />(Palace), and (he) makes the King of Magadha, Bahasatimita, bow at <br />his feet. And (he) sets up (the image) 'the Jina of Kalinga' which <br />had been taken away by King Nanda .................. and causes to <br />be brought home the riches of Amga and Magadha along with the <br />keepers of the family jewels of ....................<br />(L. 13) .................(He) builds excellent towers with <br />carved interiors and creates a settlement of a hundred masons, <br />giving them exemption from land revenue. And a wonderful and <br />marvellous enclosure of stockade for driving in the elephants <br />(he)...... and horses, elephants, jewels and rubies as well as <br />numerous pearls in hundreds (he) causes to be brought here from the <br />Pandya King.<br />(L. 14) .................(he) subjugates. In the thirteenth <br />year, on the Kumari Hill where the Wheel of Conquest had been well-<br />revolved (i.e., the religion of Jina had been preached), (he) offers <br />respectfully royal maintenances, China clothes (silks) and white <br />clothes to (the monks) who (by their austerities) have extinguished <br />the round of lives, the preachers on the religious life and conduct <br />at the Relic Memorial. By Kharavela, the illustrious, an a layman <br />devoted to worship, is realised (the nature of) jiva and deha<br />(L. 15) ................ bringing about a Council of the <br />wise ascetics and sages, from hundred (i.e., all) quarters, the <br />monks (samanas) of good deeds and who have fully followed (the <br />injunctions) .................. near the Relic Depository of the <br />Arhat, on the top of the hill, ............ with <br />stones .............. brought from many miles (yojanas) quarried <br />from excellent mines (he builds) shelters for the Sinhapatha Queen <br />Sindhula. ................ .........................<br />(L. 16) .................Patalaka(?)???(he) sets up four <br />columns inlaid with beryl??..at the cost of twenty-five hundred <br />thousands; (he) causes to be compiled expeditiously the (text) of <br />the seven-fold Angas of the sixty-four (letters). He is the King of <br />Peace, the King of Prosperity, the King of Monks (bhikshus), the <br />King of Religion (Dharma), who has been seeing, hearing and <br />realising blessings (kalyanas)-<br />(L. 17) ................ accomplished in extraordinary <br />virtues, respector of every sect, the repairer of all temples, one <br />whose chariot and army are irresistible, one whose empire is <br />protected by the chief of the empire (himself), descended from the <br />family of the Royal Sage Vasu, the Great conqueror, the King, the <br />illustrious Kharavela.</p>
