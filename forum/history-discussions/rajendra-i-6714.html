<blockquote><p>  ====================</p>
<p>  Re RAJENDRA I :: Kalinga Tamil posted this earlier in May 2007 / <br />  edited / <br />  ===================<br />  Rajendra-Chola I. It may be noted that the appointment of<br />    members of the Chola family as viceroys of conquered territories<br />    started by this king was continued in the successive reigns[18].<br />    Between his 7th and 9th year Rajendra-Chola was engaged in <br />subduing<br />    the seven and a half lakhs country of Irattapadi. This was the<br />    country of the Western Chalukya kings ruled over at this time by<br />    Jayasimha II (A.D. 1018-1042). In his own inscriptions, Jayasimha<br />    claims to have defeated the Cholas. As both of them boast of <br />  having<br />    defeated each other, the fact ought to have been either that the<br />    success was on both sides alternately or that neither of the two<br />    obtained lasting advantage. Along with the Keralas he is stated <br />to<br />    have taken possession of the island of Sandimat. What this <br />island <br />  is,<br />    is not known.<br />    The inscriptions of his twelfth year mention a number of places, <br />  which<br />    do not appear in the list of conquests mentioned in the records <br />of <br />  his<br />    ninth year. During these three years, he must have carried on an<br />    extensive campaign. He is said to have taken Sakkarakottam,<br />    Maduramandalam, Namanaikkonam, Masunidesam and Panchappalli ; to <br />  have<br />    defeated a certain Indraratha of the lunar race at Adinagar and to<br />    have taken him and his family captive ; to have captured Odda-<br />  vishaya<br />    and Kosalai-nadu ; to have defeated Dharmapala and annexed <br />  Dandabutti<br />    ; to have subdued Ranasura of Takkana-Ladam ; to have overcome<br />    Govindachandra of Vangaladesa ; to have put to flight Mahipala <br />and <br />  to<br />    have taken Uttara-Ladam and the Ganga.<br />    Of the places mentioned here, it may be noted that Sakkarakottam <br />  has<br />    been identified by Rai Bahadur Hira Lal with Chakrakota, 8 miles<br />    distant from Rajapura in the Bastar State, which was under the <br />  rule of<br />    king Dharavarsha when Kulottunga I was the Chola sovereign. Dr.<br />    Hultzsch is of opinion that Maduramandalam is different from the<br />    Pandya country and that it must refer to the northern Mathura on <br />  the<br />    Yamuna river.[19] Here it may be noted that one of the kings of<br />    Rajapura called himself Madhurantakadeva perhaps on account of his<br />    capture of Madhura. It is not likely that he could have marched<br />    against Madhura of the south to earn this title. Consequently, <br />it <br />  is<br />    reasonable to suppose that Madhura or Maduramandalam was the name <br />  of a<br />    district not far from Chakrakota bordering on the Vengi country. <br />    Namanaikkonam, Panchapalli and Masunidesam have not yet been<br />    identified. Professor Kielhorn suggests that Indraratha of the <br />  lunar<br />    race captured by Rajendra-Chola at Adinagar may be identical with <br />  that<br />    Indraratha who is mentioned in the Udaipur inscription as an <br />enemy <br />  of<br />    Bhojadeva of Dhara. Odda-vishaya is the province of Orissa and<br />    Kosalai-nadu is southern Kosala. Dandabutti and its ruler <br />  Dharmapala<br />    are not known from any other sources. Mr. R. D. Banerji is of <br />  opinion<br />    that the Takkana-Ladam of the Tamil inscriptions is distinct both <br />  from<br />    Gujarat (Lata) and the territory of southern Berar (Virata), and <br />  that<br />    is should correspond to Dakshina-Radha a part of modern Bengal.<br />[20]<br />    Uttara-Ladam must, accordingly, denote the northern part of it. <br />    Mahipala whom the Chola king deprived of his elephants and women, <br />  is<br />    identified by Professor Kielhorn with the Pala king Mahipala I.<br />    Most of the places mentioned here were conquered by Rajendra-<br />Chola <br />  I<br />    in his campaign against the north for the purpose of bringing the<br />    sacred water of the Ganges, which earned for him the title<br />    Gangaikonda-Chola. The object of Rajendra-Chola in undertaking <br />  this<br />    campaign is referred to in the Tiruvalangadu grant thus[21] : -<br />    "This light of the solar race, laughing at Bhagiratha who had <br />  brought<br />    down the Ganges to the earth from heaven by the power of his<br />    austerities, wished to sanctify his own country with the water of <br />  the<br />    Ganges. Accordingly, he ordered the commander of the army, who <br />had<br />    powerful battalions under his control, who was the resort of <br />  heroism<br />    and the foremost of diplomats, to subdue the enemy kings <br />occupying <br />  the<br />    countries on the banks of that river."<br />    The conquest of Northern India by the Cholas must have taken <br />place <br />  in<br />    1023 A.D. the above account shows that it was a general of the <br />  Chola<br />    king who conducted his campaign. But it is somewhat difficult to<br />    believe how a single Chola army could overrun within one year <br />such <br />  a<br />    vast tract of country. It is also said that after vanquishing the<br />    kings of the Gangetic countries Rajendra-Chola's general caused <br />the<br />    water of the sacred river to be brought to the Chola capital on <br />the<br />    heads of the conquered kings[22]. A stone record of the king <br />  found<br />    at Ennayiram in the South Arcot district contains interesting<br />    information regarding the conquest of the northern region by the <br />  king<br />    himself, of his stately return march with all the splendour of the<br />    conqueror, of his wedding the Ganga and hence assuming the title<br />    Gangaikonda-Chola and building a hall called after the title at<br />    Ennayiram and feeding a number of people in it. The wording of <br />the<br />    inscription seems to indicate that Rajendra-Chola I was himself<br />    engaged in the expedition against the kings of Northern India<br />    (Uttarapatha) and if may not be unreasonable to suppose that he <br />did<br />    not entrust the management of it merely to his generals as the <br />  wording<br />    of the Tiruvalangadu plates at first sight would imply[23].  <br />Though<br />    the date of the record is effaced, the conquests enumerated in it <br />  show<br />    that it cannot be earlier than A.D. 1023. It interesting to note <br />  that<br />    charities which it registers for the maintenance of a hostel and a<br />    college for religious instruction of every description, were made <br />  to<br />    secure success to the arms of the king, showing clearly that the <br />  king<br />    was at the time engaged in the war. It must have been during this<br />    northern invasion that Rajendra-Chola had the lords of the Kuluta <br />  and<br />    the Utkala countries slain by his generals as reported in the<br />    Kanyakumari inscription[24]. The encounter with the Kuluta king <br />is<br />    also referred to in an inscription of the king found at <br />  Mahendragiri<br />    where he is said to haveset up a pillar of victory. The <br />Kanyakumar<br />    inscription adds Kalinga to the list of the king's conquests.  <br />  After<br />    this invasion of northern India there seems to have been <br />  considerable<br />    communication between the kings of northern India and the Chola<br />    country. During the reign of Rajadhiraja I, the son and <br />successor <br />  of<br />    Rajendra-Chola I, the title "Protector of the people of <br />  Kannakuchchi"<br />    (Kanyakubja, i.e., Kanauj) was bestowed on one of the royal <br />  princes. <br />    This shows that Kanauj had close relations with the Cholas. In an<br />    inscription of Kulottunga I found at Gangaikondacholapuram, the <br />  usual<br />    introduction of the inscriptions of Gahadavala king <br />  Govindarachandra<br />    occurs after the name of the Chola king. As the prasasti of the<br />    gahadavala king was put in after the name of Kulotunga I, it <br />seems <br />  as<br />    if the Cholas had some sort of suzerainty over that northern <br />power.<br />    In commemoration of this memorable campaign in which the waters <br />of <br />  the<br />    Ganga were carried on the heads of the subdued kings, the Chola <br />  king<br />    founded a new city, which he called Gangaikondacholapuram. In <br />this<br />    city, Rajendra-Chola built a great temple on the model of the<br />    Rajarajesvara temple at Tanjore, built by his father. This city <br />  was<br />    the capital of Chola emperors for about 100 years. Its original <br />  name<br />    seems to have been Mudikondacholapuram, after another surname of <br />  the<br />    king, and afterwards changed into that of Gangaikondacholapuram.  <br />  It<br />    had also the name Gangapuri.<br />    Great as were the military achievements of Rajendra-Chola I in the<br />    mainland of India, he acquired even greater fame by his navel<br />    engagements, which took place on the other side of the Bay of <br />  Bengal,<br />    a feat not attempted by any sovereign of India till his time. It <br />  is<br />    said that he dispatched many ships in the midst of the rolling <br />sea,<br />    captured Samgramavijajotungavarman, the king of Kadaram, along <br />with<br />    his vehicles and accumulated treasure, took Sri-Vishaya, Pannai,<br />    Malaiyur, Mayirudingam, Ilangasokam, Mappappalam, Mevilimbangam,<br />    Valaippanduru, Takkolam, Madamalingam, Ilamuridesam, Nakkavaram <br />and<br />    Kadram. Samgramavijayottungavarman, the king against whom this <br />war<br />    was waged with great advantage of the Cholas was probably a <br />  successor<br />    fo Maravijayaottungavarman of the Sailendravamsa, the lord of<br />    Sri-Vishaya, who while extending the kingdom of Kataha, is <br />  reported in<br />    the Leyden plates to have built a lofty and beautiful monastery at<br />    Nagapattanam and called it Chudamanivarma-vihara, after the name <br />of<br />    his father Chudamanivarman. Since it is stated in the plates that<br />    both Rajaraja I and Rajendra-Chola I patronized the vihara, it <br />  appears<br />    that Samgramavijayaottungavarman, proving refractory, Rajendra-<br />  Chola<br />    had to take the extreme step of conquering the whole of his <br />  kingdom ?<br />    in which must have been included all the places mentioned above ?</p>
<p>  and<br />    depriving him of his wealth. It is also learnt that Rajendra-<br />Chola<br />    (Shih-li-li-cha-yin-lo-lo-chu-lo) sent an embassy to China, <br />though <br />  we<br />    do not know what his intentions were in that direction[25].<br />    Among the places mentioned in the final campaign of the king,<br />    Sri-Vishaya or Sri-Vijaya has been taken to be the same as San-fo-<br />  tsai<br />    of the Chinese annals and identified by Mr. George Coedes with the<br />    residency of Palambang in Sumatra ; Nakkavaram and Pappalam stand<br />    respectively for the Nicobar islands and a port of that name in <br />  Burma<br />    ; Takkolam has been identified with Takopa on the western part of <br />  the<br />    Malay Peninsula and Kadaram is located in lower Burma. Rest of <br />the<br />    places are not known.<br />    We shall here notice a few facts concerning the relations of<br />    Rajendra-Chola I. Kundavai, the eldest sister of his father <br />  married a<br />    chief named Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar, who figures as a feudatory <br />  in<br />    some of the inscriptions of Rajendra-Chola I. The king's sister, <br />  the<br />    younger Kundavai, was married to the Eastern Chalukya Vimaladitya <br />  and<br />    this prince was in the Chola dominions for some time, though the<br />    object of his mission is not known. Rajendra-Chola had several<br />    queens. One of them was Panchavanmahadevi ; another was<br />    Danti-Pirattiyar[26] and a third Viramahadevi. Of the last, an<br />    inscription of Rajadhiraja states that she entered the supreme <br />  feet of<br />    Brahma (i.e., died) in the very year of demise of Rajendra-Chola <br />I<br />    and was buried in the very tomb of that king[27]. This tomb in <br />  which<br />    the bodies of the two royal personages were deposited might <br />  possibly<br />    have been at Brahmadesam in the North Arcot district. As the <br />  record<br />    is dated in the 26th year of the reign of Rajadhiraja, it is <br />  inferred<br />    that, Rajendra-Chola died in that year, i.e., A.D. 1044 and that <br />  his<br />    queen Viramahadevi committed sati and was buried with him[28].  <br />The<br />    Kanyakumari inscription settles the relationship of Rajendra-<br />Chola <br />  I<br />    and his successors Rajadhiraja, Rajendradeva and Vira-Rajendra.  <br />It<br />    states that like unto the three fires of a sacrifice there were <br />  born<br />    to Rajendra-Chola I three sons of whom the first was Rajadhiraja <br />  and<br />    that Rajendradeva and Vira-Rajaendra were his younger brothers<br />  [29]. <br />    Ammanga was the name of his daughter who married the Eastern <br />  Chalukya<br />    king Rajaraja I : their son was Kulottunga I.<br />    King Rajendra-Chola I struck coins in his own name. They are <br />  referred<br />    to in his inscriptions under the names Rajendrasolan-kasu and<br />    Madurantakadevan-Madai. Besides these, Rajarajan-kasu issued in <br />  the<br />    time of Rajaraja I was also current in his time[30].<br />    Of the literary activity displayed in the Chola country during the<br />    period of rajendra Chola's rule, we know very little. Saiva <br />works <br />  of<br />    the type of Siddhantasaravali must have been largely written and<br />    patronized by the king who was himself a devout Saiva. Jaina and<br />    Buddhist literature also had its share of royal patronage. From <br />  the<br />    Upasakajanalankara of the Mahathera Ananda, a manuscript of which <br />  has<br />    been reviewed by Dr. Barnett in the Journal of the Royal Asiactic<br />    Society for January 1901, pp. 87 to 90, it may be inferred that <br />  the<br />    king lent his patronage to Buddhist literature. Dr. Barnett <br />  thought<br />    that the Chola-Ganga mentioned in the Upasakajanalankara was <br />  identical<br />    with Anantavarman Chodaganga. This could not be, for, in the <br />first<br />    place, the latter is not a Chola but an Eastern Ganga king who <br />  ruled<br />    at Kalinganagara which has been identified with Mukhalingam in the<br />    Parlakimedi estate, Ganjam district. Pandubhumandala is stated <br />to <br />  be<br />    the country where Chola-Ganga was ruling as a samanta (a <br />  subordinate<br />    ruler) perhaps as the viceroy of his father. This fact makes the<br />    chances of his identity with Anantavarman Chodaganga very<br />    problematical. Consequently, a different identification has to be<br />    sought for. The king mentioned is in my opinion the famous Chola<br />    emperor Rajendra-Chola I who was also called Gangaikonda-Chola on<br />    account of his having subdued the country about Gangai, i.e., the<br />    Ganges. His conquests, as we know, were many and spread <br />  practically<br />    over the whole of India and extended even to Ceylon. The<br />    Tiruvalangadu grant clearly states that Rajendra-Chola I, also <br />  called<br />    Madhurantaka, took possession of the wealth of the Pandya king, <br />  placed<br />    there his own son Chola-Pandy for the protection of the Pandya<br />    country, and that he constructed in his capital the tank called<br />    Cholagangam evidently so named after one of his own titles. This <br />  last<br />    fact decisively proves the identity of the king mentioned in the<br />    Upasakajanalankara with king Rajendra-Chola I. The name<br />    Gunakara-Perumpalli which the king is stated to have given to one <br />  of<br />    the three viharas which he founded in Ceylon also clearly <br />indicates<br />    that the builder was a Tamil king.<br />    Rajendra-Chola I succeeded to the throne in A.D. 1012 and ruled <br />  till<br />    at least A.D. 1044. His position as a samanta in the Pandya <br />  country<br />    must have been during the early years of his heir-apparently <br />prior <br />  to<br />    A.D. 1012. The identification of Cholaganga with Rajendra-Chola <br />  will<br />    thus alter the dates and the identification of the Mahathera <br />  Ananda,<br />    the author of Upasakajanalankara.<br />    In addition to the surnames Gangaikonda-Chola, Mudigonda-Chola and<br />    Cholaganga, which have been noticed above, Rajendra-Chola also <br />had <br />  the<br />    surnames Madurantaka, Nigarili-Chola and Pandita-Chola. The last <br />  name<br />    shows that he must have been considered a scholar in Sanskrit.  <br />It <br />  is<br />    also stated in the Siddhantasaravali of Trilochanasivacharya that<br />    Rajendra-Chola on the occasion of his visit to the Ganges saw <br />there<br />    the best of the Saivas and brought them with him and settled them <br />  at<br />    Kanchi and other places in the Chola country. Information about<br />    Rajadhiraja and his successors could be gathered from the <br />elaborate<br />    introductions to their inscriptions given by Prof. Hultzsch in <br />  parts<br />    I. II and III.<br />    [1] Below pp. 246 ff.<br />    [2] This title suggests that Sundara-Chola's actual predecessor <br />or<br />    elected predecessor must have been a Parakesarivarman, and<br />    Uttama-Chola, the son of Gandaraditya, bore this surname but may <br />  have<br />    been too young at the time to succeed his father.<br />    [3] Ep.

Ind., Vol. XV, pp. 44 to 72.<br />    [7] Another queen mentioned in inscriptions was<br />    Parantakandevi-Ammanar, the daughter of a Chera king.<br />    [8] The adoption of the title Rajakesarivarman could be <br />explained <br />  by<br />    saying that the claims of Gandaraditya's chosen successor, viz., <br />  his<br />    son Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola were temporarily set aside and<br />    postponed.<br />    [9] No. 122, dated in the 14th year of Rajakesarivarman has been<br />    attributed to Sundara-Chola Parantaka II, but may more probably <br />  belong<br />    to the reign of Rajaraja.<br />    [10] See below, p. 420 V. 68.<br />    [11] Loc.

<p>    After reading through KAN 'Colas' I am somehow convinced that we <br />  have given short change to the Chola kings who followed RJC. While <br />  RRC/RJC may be the greatest of Cholas, I strongly doubt whether RJC <br />  may have been able to maintain an empire without the aid of <br />  Rajadhiraja. Rajadhiraja, to me atleast, seems a great warrior king <br />  in the moulds of greate empire builders across the world. When I <br />  read about the battle of Koppam, the heroics of Rajadhiraja and <br />  Rajendra II shows that they are the Cholas without whom the <br />  line/empire would have perished then and there. Just the number of <br />  battles he has fought during RJCs lifetime and his own kingship <br />  attest to the problems of a great empire and I strongly doubt even <br />  under the most favorable scenario, it would've been possible for <br />  Cholas to stop the moghal invasion. After all, they couldn't subdue <br />  the W.Chalukyas even after all the fighting and the rise of the <br />  Hoysalas. My reasoning being while the entire N.India from <br />Rajasthan <br />  to Bihar can be looked on as a single entity in terms of language <br />  and culture and therefore, easier to conquer militarily and keep it <br />  at peace by a benign soverign (as is the case from Ashoka to Harsha <br />  to Akbar) whereas the deccan had too many entities (telugus, <br />  kannadigas, kerals) who identified themselves as seperate nations. <br />  This single factor bodes ill for any empire that sprang from the <br />  south and is true for the Cholas as well as the Vijayanagar empire <br />a <br />  half century later. But after all, we are talking about a 'What <br />  might have been' scenario and we can as well state that the Cholas <br />  might have been the dynasty which reversed the invasion route and <br />  invaded the persian empire itself!Muthu Prakash R--- In <br />  <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Rajendhra Cholan!" <br />  <rajendhracholan@  wrote:   But, RjC indeed fight agaist Gazni, in <br />  his way back to GKC after   vanquishing Pala's and Kosala's.    <br />  Creating something is tough, but sustaining it is more tough, thats <br />    where all kingdoms, went down.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>the kamboja kingdom existed during iron age in gandhara. contemprory to chola period this area must have been over run by the muslims.</p>
<p>i think the charriot gift points more and more to the kamboja kingdom in bengal.</p>

<p>There were no Kamboja kings ruling any where closer to Kanauj region. But there have been a Kamboja next to Gandhara kingdom. <br />The Kanauj was not Kamboja, and both are historically separate regions of then India.</p>
<p>The reference in the Karanthai Thamil Sangam Copper Plates on the identity of the Kamboja Rajan who gave a Chariot to Rajendra Chola, is now under much confusion "to me", which I am trying to sort out with more study on same.The confusion is around the point as to whether the Kamboja king under reference was the king of Kampuchea (former Cambodia)in South-East Asia or washe the king of Kamboja which was adjacent to the former Gandhara region, which was within the present Pakistan. </p>
<p>I sometime back posted a Thread titled as "Rajarajaeswarem &amp; Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem Siva Temples" in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym . But that article has now been developed with more "historical informations on Chola conquests in Mainland India", and 'now appears' in the maiyyam.com website (please refer same). In same I have referred to my "new thinking" on the regions captured by Rajaraja Chola- 1 and Rajendra Chola - 1 in the north of India. </p>
<p>These historical informations will be "further" developed with "much more detail informations and evidences on same" and will appear as a New Thread titled, </p>
<p>A NEW INTERPRETATION OF CHOLA POLITICAL CONQUESTS IN MAINLAND INDIA <br />DURING THE PERIOD OF RAJARAJA CHOLA - 1 AND RAJENDRA CHOLA - 1 </p>
<p>in which I hope to firmly stampdown and say which of the above regions was the Kamboja of the Karanthai Thamil Sangam Plates. </p>
<p>Until then my kind regards to all.</p>
<p>Anbudan - Virarajendra </p>

<p>      A "follow-up-note" on the Historical Study - on the years of<br />      conquests of countries, listed in the Rajaraja Chola's Meikeerththi</p>
<p>      In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate- "years of<br />      conquests" of countries by RajarajaChola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />      first made a Schedule of Inscriptions of Rajaraja - sequenced by their<br />      respective years, for our study. Also I have provided a Summary on the</p>
<p>      deductions made fromthe contents of these Inscriptions.<br />      Rajaraja's expedition around Kalinga, and around Irattaipaadi are<br />      provided below with further explanation.</p>
<p>      Inscriptions</p>
<p>      27 of 1906 from Thirukkadaiyur SII - XXII - 27</p>
<p>      Meikeerththi includes - Kollam, Kalingam<br />      - 16th year</p>
<p>      AlsoThiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Vanga,</p>
<p>      Magadha, Aratta, and Odda withKalingam</p>
<p>      SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 ? 205</p>
<p>      217 of 1894 from Thiruvaiyaaru, SII - V ? 516</p>
<p>      Meikeerththi included - Irattaipaadi<br />      -22nd year</p>
<p>      Also an Inscription includes - Konkana 5 of 1895</p>
<p>      EC ? 111 Sr 140</p>
<p>      Also Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Sourashtra</p>
<p>      with Irattaipaadi SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 - 205</p>
<p>      Summary</p>
<p>      In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />      sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />      part of this same year aseparate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />      Orissa, which too was captured. Itappears it was in this same expedition<br />      hecaptured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of West<br />      Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered region<br />      of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>      ----------------</p>
<p>      Fromthe Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates &amp; anInscription we note Rajaraja<br />      Chola - 1 captured the regions of Irattaipaadi, Konkana, Sourashtra,<br />      Kalingam, Odda, Magadha, Vanga&amp; Aratta among others.</p>
<p>      Even though the conquests of the above countries in the north of India<br />      are clearly indicated in the Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates, many<br />      Historians have not discussed in respect of same in their writings. This<br />      could possibly be in view - of their doubts on the authenticity of<br />      these references to some countries of India, said to have been captured<br />      by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>      However we have further evidences toprove "that in fact" these<br />      countries too have been won in warefareby Rajaraja Chola - 1, other than<br />      the countries found in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>      The references to the regions captured by Rajaraja in Karandai Thamil<br />      SangamPlates are given as follows:</p>
<p>      "?? Peruvaliyinai selvamaaka kondavanaana SeerRasarasan,<br />      Singala, Pandiya, Keralaarasarkalaiyum, Kongesuvararkalaiyum,<br />      Malavarkalaiyum, Thelungarkalaiyum, Gangarkalaiyum, Kalingarkalaiyum,<br />      Vangarkalaiyum, Magadharkalaiyum, Chalukiya arasarkalaiyum, Kurunaattu<br />      arasarkalaiyum, eanaiya ellaa arasarkalaiyum thoal valiyaal, poril<br />      ventru (won in warfare), avarkaludaiya, yaanaikalaiyum,<br />      kuthiraikalaiyum, naadukalaiyum, irraththinangalaiyum, selvangalaiyum,<br />      kaippatrinaan??."</p>
<p>      In the above reference, the countries that have been won in warefare<br />      ("poril ventru" in Tamil) by Rajaraja Chola - 1, there are three<br />      new regions mentioned that are not found in the Thiruvaalangkadu Copper<br />      plates. One is the region of the Chalukiya-arasar which we are aware was<br />      the Irrataipaadi Elaraiilakkam of the Meikeerththi,and the other two<br />      being the Malavar and Kurunaatu arasar.</p>
<p>      Malavar (Malava) were a dynasty which was in existance in the north of<br />      Maharashtra. It appears that Rajaraja's forces even won over the<br />      Bhojas of Malava. There is a referance in this Karandai Thamil Sangam<br />      Plates which confirms same as"?..(Rajaraja)?.. Bhojadevan<br />      udauya thalaiyai thuniththaan??".</p>
<p>      Also a correction has to be made on my previous articlewherin I had<br />      mentioned the south Saurashtra was in north Maharashtra. But in the face<br />      of more evidence it has to be correctly located in Gujarat. The<br />      Kuru-naatu arasar needs further investigation and confirmation on its<br />      precise location.</p>
<p>      Now on investigating the contents of the Essaalam Copper Plates we have<br />      the list of countries conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1stated as follows:</p>
<p>      "???Arumolivarman who with his long and beautiful arms (that)<br />      bored the marks of sankhu andchakra in his palms. He conquered the<br />      Gangas, Vangas, Kalingas, Magadhas, Malavas, Simhalas, Andhras, Rattas,<br />      Oddas, Katakas, Keralas, Gaudas and Pandiyas. By the wealth obtained<br />      through his conquests he erected at Thanjapuri a very great temple named<br />      Rajarajaesvarem??."</p>
<p>      Odda, and the new region Gauda are mentioned again as regions conquered<br />      by Rajaraja Chola ? 1 in the Esaalam Copper Plates. "Gauda Desa<br />      encompassed parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh".</p>
<p>      mentioned in three Copper Plate Grants.Malavas are mentioned in two<br />      Copper Plate Grants</p>
<p>      Rattas, Oddas too are mentioned in two Copper Plate Grants and Gauda<br />      only in one Copper Plate Grant.</p>
<p>      Also another correction has to be now made on my previous article wherin<br />      I had mentioned the Aratta (as appearing in Thiruvaalankadu Copper<br />      Plates) was in West Bengal along with Vanga. But in the face of more<br />      evidence it has to be taken correctly as the short form of Irattaipaadi.<br />      This same region is mentioned in Essaalam Copper Plates as Rattas andin<br />      Karandai Thamil Sangham Plates as Chalukiyaregion.</p>
<p>      Hence we can safely conclude that in addition to the countries found in<br />      Rajaraja'sMeikeerththi, the regions of Magadha, Vanga, Odda, and<br />      Gauda, (inthe north-east India), and Saurashtra, Malava and Konkana (in<br />      the north-west) were conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>      Then the question may be asked as to why the above regions are not<br />      included in Rajaraja's Meikeerththi. The only explanation we can<br />      give "for the time being" is as follows:</p>
<p>      It could have been a possibillity that during the period of<br />      Rajaraja's invasion of Irattaipaadi ? the king of Irattaipaadi<br />      was already in authority also over Saurashtra, Malava, and Konkana -<br />      being it's neighbouring regions. It appears that these three regions<br />      too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />      Irattaipaadi,but only the region Irattaipaadi Elarai Illakkam however<br />      was mentioned in the Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>      Likewise during the period of Rajaraja'sinvasion of Kalinga - the<br />      king of Kalinga was already in authority also over Magadha, Vanga,<br />      Gauda, and Odda - being its neighbouring regions. It appears that these<br />      four regions too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />      Kalinga, but onlythe region Kalinga however was mentioned in the<br />      Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>      Thisis an inferance only, and an indepth study on same is necessary<br />      along with the study of the History of the above mentioned regions of<br />      this period, to acertain whether this could have been the possible<br />      reason for these regions - of not having been mentioned in the<br />      Rajaraja's Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>      The End</p>

<p>      deductions made fromthe contents of these Inscriptions.<br />      Rajaraja's expedition around Kalinga, and around Irattaipaadi are<br />      provided below with further explanation.</p>

<p>      Also an Inscription includes - Konkana 5 of 1895</p>
<p>      EC ? 111 Sr 140</p>
<p>      Also Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Sourashtra</p>
<p>      with Irattaipaadi SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 - 205</p>
<p>      Summary</p>
<p>      In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />      sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />      part of this same year aseparate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />      Orissa, which too was captured. Itappears it was in this same expedition<br />      hecaptured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of West<br />      Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered region<br />      of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>      ----------------</p>
<p>      Fromthe Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates &amp; anInscription we note Rajaraja<br />      Chola - 1 captured the regions of Irattaipaadi, Konkana, Sourashtra,<br />      Kalingam, Odda, Magadha, Vanga&amp; Aratta among others.</p>
<p>      Even though the conquests of the above countries in the north of India<br />      are clearly indicated in the Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates, many<br />      Historians have not discussed in respect of same in their writings. This<br />      could possibly be in view - of their doubts on the authenticity of<br />      these references to some countries of India, said to have been captured<br />      by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>      However we have further evidences toprove "that in fact" these<br />      countries too have been won in warefareby Rajaraja Chola - 1, other than<br />      the countries found in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>      The references to the regions captured by Rajaraja in Karandai Thamil<br />      SangamPlates are given as follows:</p>
<p>      "?? Peruvaliyinai selvamaaka kondavanaana SeerRasarasan,<br />      Singala, Pandiya, Keralaarasarkalaiyum, Kongesuvararkalaiyum,<br />      Malavarkalaiyum, Thelungarkalaiyum, Gangarkalaiyum, Kalingarkalaiyum,<br />      Vangarkalaiyum, Magadharkalaiyum, Chalukiya arasarkalaiyum, Kurunaattu<br />      arasarkalaiyum, eanaiya ellaa arasarkalaiyum thoal valiyaal, poril<br />      ventru (won in warfare), avarkaludaiya, yaanaikalaiyum,<br />      kuthiraikalaiyum, naadukalaiyum, irraththinangalaiyum, selvangalaiyum,<br />      kaippatrinaan??."</p>
<p>      In the above reference, the countries that have been won in warefare<br />      ("poril ventru" in Tamil) by Rajaraja Chola - 1, there are three<br />      new regions mentioned that are not found in the Thiruvaalangkadu Copper<br />      plates. One is the region of the Chalukiya-arasar which we are aware was<br />      the Irrataipaadi Elaraiilakkam of the Meikeerththi,and the other two<br />      being the Malavar and Kurunaatu arasar.</p>
<p>      Malavar (Malava) were a dynasty which was in existance in the north of<br />      Maharashtra. It appears that Rajaraja's forces even won over the<br />      Bhojas of Malava. There is a referance in this Karandai Thamil Sangam<br />      Plates which confirms same as"?..(Rajaraja)?.. Bhojadevan<br />      udauya thalaiyai thuniththaan??".</p>
<p>      Also a correction has to be made on my previous articlewherin I had<br />      mentioned the south Saurashtra was in north Maharashtra. But in the face<br />      of more evidence it has to be correctly located in Gujarat. The<br />      Kuru-naatu arasar needs further investigation and confirmation on its<br />      precise location.</p>
<p>      Now on investigating the contents of the Essaalam Copper Plates we have<br />      the list of countries conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1stated as follows:</p>
<p>      "???Arumolivarman who with his long and beautiful arms (that)<br />      bored the marks of sankhu andchakra in his palms. He conquered the<br />      Gangas, Vangas, Kalingas, Magadhas, Malavas, Simhalas, Andhras, Rattas,<br />      Oddas, Katakas, Keralas, Gaudas and Pandiyas. By the wealth obtained<br />      through his conquests he erected at Thanjapuri a very great temple named<br />      Rajarajaesvarem??."</p>
<p>      Odda, and the new region Gauda are mentioned again as regions conquered<br />      by Rajaraja Chola ? 1 in the Esaalam Copper Plates. "Gauda Desa<br />      encompassed parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh".</p>
<p>      mentioned in three Copper Plate Grants.Malavas are mentioned in two<br />      Copper Plate Grants</p>
<p>      Rattas, Oddas too are mentioned in two Copper Plate Grants and Gauda<br />      only in one Copper Plate Grant.</p>
<p>      Also another correction has to be now made on my previous article wherin<br />      I had mentioned the Aratta (as appearing in Thiruvaalankadu Copper<br />      Plates) was in West Bengal along with Vanga. But in the face of more<br />      evidence it has to be taken correctly as the short form of Irattaipaadi.<br />      This same region is mentioned in Essaalam Copper Plates as Rattas andin<br />      Karandai Thamil Sangham Plates as Chalukiyaregion.</p>
<p>      Hence we can safely conclude that in addition to the countries found in<br />      Rajaraja'sMeikeerththi, the regions of Magadha, Vanga, Odda, and<br />      Gauda, (inthe north-east India), and Saurashtra, Malava and Konkana (in<br />      the north-west) were conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>      Then the question may be asked as to why the above regions are not<br />      included in Rajaraja's Meikeerththi. The only explanation we can<br />      give "for the time being" is as follows:</p>
<p>      It could have been a possibillity that during the period of<br />      Rajaraja's invasion of Irattaipaadi ? the king of Irattaipaadi<br />      was already in authority also over Saurashtra, Malava, and Konkana -<br />      being it's neighbouring regions. It appears that these three regions<br />      too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />      Irattaipaadi,but only the region Irattaipaadi Elarai Illakkam however<br />      was mentioned in the Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>      Likewise during the period of Rajaraja'sinvasion of Kalinga - the<br />      king of Kalinga was already in authority also over Magadha, Vanga,<br />      Gauda, and Odda - being its neighbouring regions. It appears that these<br />      four regions too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />      Kalinga, but onlythe region Kalinga however was mentioned in the<br />      Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>      Thisis an inferance only, and an indepth study on same is necessary<br />      along with the study of the History of the above mentioned regions of<br />      this period, to acertain whether this could have been the possible<br />      reason for these regions - of not having been mentioned in the<br />      Rajaraja's Meikeerththi.</p>

<p>    A "follow-up-note" on the Historical Study - on the years of<br />    conquests of countries, listed in the Rajaraja Chola's Meikeerththi</p>
<p>    In my efforts to arrive at an almost accurate- "years of<br />    conquests" of countries by RajarajaChola - 1(A.D.985-1014), I have<br />    first made a Schedule of Inscriptions of Rajaraja - sequenced by their<br />    respective years, for our study. Also I have provided a Summary on the</p>
<p>    deductions made fromthe contents of these Inscriptions.<br />    Rajaraja's expedition around Kalinga, and around Irattaipaadi are<br />    provided below with further explanation.</p>
<p>    Inscriptions</p>
<p>    27 of 1906 from Thirukkadaiyur SII - XXII - 27</p>
<p>    Meikeerththi includes - Kollam, Kalingam<br />    - 16th year</p>
<p>    AlsoThiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Vanga,</p>
<p>    Magadha, Aratta, and Odda withKalingam</p>
<p>    SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 ? 205</p>
<p>    217 of 1894 from Thiruvaiyaaru, SII - V ? 516</p>
<p>    Meikeerththi included - Irattaipaadi<br />    -22nd year</p>
<p>    Also an Inscription includes - Konkana 5 of 1895</p>
<p>    EC ? 111 Sr 140</p>
<p>    Also Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates includes Sourashtra</p>
<p>    with Irattaipaadi SII - 3 - Part 3&amp;4 - 205</p>
<p>    Summary</p>
<p>    In the early part of the following year in A.D.1000 (985 + [16-1] he<br />    sent an expedition and conquered the Kollam of Kerala. In the second<br />    part of this same year aseparate expedition was sent to Kalinga of<br />    Orissa, which too was captured. Itappears it was in this same expedition<br />    hecaptured Odda of Orissa and Magadha of Bihar, Vanga &amp; Aratta of West<br />    Bengal, all regions being in the north of the earlier conquered region<br />    of Vengi Mandalam.</p>
<p>    ----------------</p>
<p>    Fromthe Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates &amp; anInscription we note Rajaraja<br />    Chola - 1 captured the regions of Irattaipaadi, Konkana, Sourashtra,<br />    Kalingam, Odda, Magadha, Vanga&amp; Aratta among others.</p>
<p>    Even though the conquests of the above countries in the north of India<br />    are clearly indicated in the Thiruvaalankadu Copper Plates, many<br />    Historians have not discussed in respect of same in their writings. This<br />    could possibly be in view - of their doubts on the authenticity of<br />    these references to some countries of India, said to have been captured<br />    by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>    However we have further evidences toprove "that in fact" these<br />    countries too have been won in warefareby Rajaraja Chola - 1, other than<br />    the countries found in his Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>    The references to the regions captured by Rajaraja in Karandai Thamil<br />    SangamPlates are given as follows:</p>
<p>    "?? Peruvaliyinai selvamaaka kondavanaana SeerRasarasan,<br />    Singala, Pandiya, Keralaarasarkalaiyum, Kongesuvararkalaiyum,<br />    Malavarkalaiyum, Thelungarkalaiyum, Gangarkalaiyum, Kalingarkalaiyum,<br />    Vangarkalaiyum, Magadharkalaiyum, Chalukiya arasarkalaiyum, Kurunaattu<br />    arasarkalaiyum, eanaiya ellaa arasarkalaiyum thoal valiyaal, poril<br />    ventru (won in warfare), avarkaludaiya, yaanaikalaiyum,<br />    kuthiraikalaiyum, naadukalaiyum, irraththinangalaiyum, selvangalaiyum,<br />    kaippatrinaan??."</p>
<p>    In the above reference, the countries that have been won in warefare<br />    ("poril ventru" in Tamil) by Rajaraja Chola - 1, there are three<br />    new regions mentioned that are not found in the Thiruvaalangkadu Copper<br />    plates. One is the region of the Chalukiya-arasar which we are aware was<br />    the Irrataipaadi Elaraiilakkam of the Meikeerththi,and the other two<br />    being the Malavar and Kurunaatu arasar.</p>
<p>    Malavar (Malava) were a dynasty which was in existance in the north of<br />    Maharashtra. It appears that Rajaraja's forces even won over the<br />    Bhojas of Malava. There is a referance in this Karandai Thamil Sangam<br />    Plates which confirms same as"?..(Rajaraja)?.. Bhojadevan<br />    udauya thalaiyai thuniththaan??".</p>
<p>    Also a correction has to be made on my previous articlewherin I had<br />    mentioned the south Saurashtra was in north Maharashtra. But in the face<br />    of more evidence it has to be correctly located in Gujarat. The<br />    Kuru-naatu arasar needs further investigation and confirmation on its<br />    precise location.</p>
<p>    Now on investigating the contents of the Essaalam Copper Plates we have<br />    the list of countries conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1stated as follows:</p>
<p>    "???Arumolivarman who with his long and beautiful arms (that)<br />    bored the marks of sankhu andchakra in his palms. He conquered the<br />    Gangas, Vangas, Kalingas, Magadhas, Malavas, Simhalas, Andhras, Rattas,<br />    Oddas, Katakas, Keralas, Gaudas and Pandiyas. By the wealth obtained<br />    through his conquests he erected at Thanjapuri a very great temple named<br />    Rajarajaesvarem??."</p>
<p>    Odda, and the new region Gauda are mentioned again as regions conquered<br />    by Rajaraja Chola ? 1 in the Esaalam Copper Plates. "Gauda Desa<br />    encompassed parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh".</p>
<p>    mentioned in three Copper Plate Grants.Malavas are mentioned in two<br />    Copper Plate Grants</p>
<p>    Rattas, Oddas too are mentioned in two Copper Plate Grants and Gauda<br />    only in one Copper Plate Grant.</p>
<p>    Also another correction has to be now made on my previous article wherin<br />    I had mentioned the Aratta (as appearing in Thiruvaalankadu Copper<br />    Plates) was in West Bengal along with Vanga. But in the face of more<br />    evidence it has to be taken correctly as the short form of Irattaipaadi.<br />    This same region is mentioned in Essaalam Copper Plates as Rattas and in<br />    Karandai Thamil Sangham Plates as Chalukiyaregion.</p>
<p>    Hence we can safely conclude that in addition to the countries found in<br />    Rajaraja'sMeikeerththi, the regions of Magadha, Vanga, Odda, and<br />    Gauda, (inthe north-east India), and Saurashtra, Malava and Konkana (in<br />    the north-west) were conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1.</p>
<p>    Then the question may be asked as to why the above regions are not<br />    included in Rajaraja's Meikeerththi. The only explanation we can<br />    give "for the time being" is as follows:</p>
<p>    It could have been a possibillity that during the period of<br />    Rajaraja's invasion of Irattaipaadi ? the king of Irattaipaadi<br />    was already in authority also over Saurashtra, Malava, and Konkana -<br />    being it's neighbouring regions. It appears that these three regions<br />    too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />    Irattaipaadi,but only the region Irattaipaadi Elarai Illakkam however<br />    was mentioned in the Meikeerththi.</p>
<p>    Likewise during the period of Rajaraja'sinvasion of Kalinga - the<br />    king of Kalinga was already in authority also over Magadha, Vanga,<br />    Gauda, and Odda - being its neighbouring regions. It appears that these<br />    four regions too came under Cholas automatically when he conquered the<br />    Kalinga, but onlythe region Kalinga however was mentioned in the<br />    Meikeerththi.</p>

<p>The Realignment of Sino - Indian Relations 600 - 1400, Honolulu, <br />Association for Asian Studies, University of Hawai" I Press 2003.</p>
<p>Tansen Sen argued that the Chola Kingdom contributed to the <br />development of the WORLD market and that "the trading ports are <br />mercantile guilds of the Chola kingdom played a significant role in <br />linking the markets of China with rest of the World.</p>
<p>actively protected their commercial interests through warfare....</p>
<p>Infact Chinese officials could not DISTINGUISH between CHOLA MONARCH <br />and MERCHANT SPONSORED ENVOYS since the IDENTITIES and AFFLIATIONS of <br />those present were LOST IN CLERICAL ERROR and then DELIBERATE <br />MISINFORMATION (!)....</p>
<p>For instance, a Srivijayam envoy succeded in convincing Chinese <br />officials that the Chola Kingdom was a VASSAL STATE to Srivijaya in <br />the height of former's power, resulting in official maltreatment of <br />the FIRST CHOLA ENVOY in 1015.....</p>
<p>Meera Abraham, in her book "Two Medieval Merchant Guilds of South <br />India, New Delhi (1988) suggested that the Chola naval raid on the <br />MALAY PENINSULA and INDONESIA in 1025 was an effort to protect Indian <br />commercial interests from interference by the Srivijaya Kingdom, which <br />occupied a intermediary trade position between CHINA and INDIA ..  </p>
<p>And Tansen Sen is quoted by <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastri in his Foreign Notices of South <br />India.<br />===================</acronym></p>
<p>It is not DIRECT REFERENCE to Rajendra I.... yet very informative that <br />the FIRST ENVOY WAS SENT TO CHIAN in 1015 AD .. ! and after 1012 AD, <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  I did not show interest in polity at the least.</p>
