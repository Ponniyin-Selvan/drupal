</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>1. There has definitely been religious literature, but saying that </p>
<blockquote><p>  without religion literaure loses its spirit is not only being <br />  chauvinistic but also being plain ignorant. Thirukkural is still <br />  amazing literature without the first ten lines, if you can't <br />  appreciate it, I really have nothing more to say. </p></blockquote>
<p>If you think thirukural has religion only in its <br />first ten kurals then you havent read it fully.Thirukural is full of <br />vedic concepts and hindu gods.even in inbathupal lord thirumal is <br />mentioned as "tamarai kannan".Tirukural is full of vedic concepts <br />like yagnas,pithru dharma,panchagni and so on.</p>
<p>There is no religion in the sonnets of Shakespeare or the verses of <br />Shelley or Keats<br />I spoke only about tamil.Not any other language.</p>
<blockquote><p>  2. I am not accusing you of anything. I said "I am not very <br />tolerant of religious conservatism". Its me, not you. I simply </p></blockquote>
<p>cannot understand people who take literally whatever is said in <br />some book ages ago and use that to justify 'anything they want'(not <br />everything, mind you.<br />Even tirukural was written ages ago.It is <br />hailed as tamil vedam.Whatever is there in veda is in tirukural <br />also.A book is old or new doesnt matter.how we can benefit from it <br />matters.Various vedic concepts like respecting parents,pathivratha <br />dharma are still guiding hindu society.Somebooks and concepts have <br />no age.</p>
<p>"Nowadays, since its not politically correct, we will let <br />low castes enter the temple though its mentioned in the same holy <br />books but but we will agree with the book on other kinds of <br />nonsense like 'how to not let certain biologically impure actresses <br />into the temple'). I just find it interesting that they are not <br />capable of applying their (God-given?) brians and for some reason, <br />their standard of comparison is some other religion which does the <br />same thing! As I said, I find it difficult to converse with people <br />like that, so its my fault; I am not accusing you of anything"</p>
<p>In which veda has it been said that low castes should <br />be prevented from entering the temple?when US was at its height of <br />slavery,slavery was justified by invoking bible.Does that mean that <br />bible is to be blamed?No.Criminals use religion as a mask in all <br />religions.It happened in hinduism also.Thirupanalvar was a dalit and <br />he was carried by sri rangam bhramins in their shoulders as a <br />punishment for their not allowing him into temple.</p>
<p>why should my religion compare itself with other <br />religions and import their standards?we have no such necessity.we <br />dont see any such imitable qualities in any other religion which <br />isnt there in ours.Hinduism has nothing to learn from anybody.It is <br />the guru for the whole universe.</p>
<p>"Food for thought: Couldn't resist this one - <br />One man one wife was also a ramayan age standard.Do we give it up <br />since its old?No.'One woman, five husbands is Mahabharatha <br />standards' - why don't we start living that way from now on?"</p>
<p>polyandry has been allowed under special circumstances in <br />hinduism.Polygyny and polygamy are also allowed under special <br />circumstances.monogomy is the general norm and polygamy is a special <br />norm valid in ceratain occasions.what is the big deal here?I dont <br />understand.when a society can allow polygyny whats wrong in allowing <br />polyandry too?</p>

        <p>Priya,</p>
<p>If you read what I wrote before, you will prob realise that I said <br />despite facts brought up in the forum by quite a few people, we <br />still seem to hear abt 'interesting' interpretations of abstract <br />texts and this will keep going on regardless of whatever evidence <br />one brings to the table. To find out about good/bad aspects of any <br />religion, texts or followers(after all, a religion is only as good <br />as its followers), all you need is a widely available search <br />technology called Google and an open, questioning mind(no colored <br />glasses, mind you). As the second part of that requirement is not <br />forthcoming, I believe this is a complete waste of my time and <br />yours. Peace.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day.</p>

<p>  I still am waiting to hear what are the bad aspects in hindu <br />  vedas.If you blame the later day practices of people of kaliyuga <br />on <br />  vedas,Im sorry.Its like saying the acts of current day americans <br />  were instigated by bible.Totally wrong.</p>

<p>    Just like how the Kanchi seer's arrest is an 'international <br />    conspiracy',all facts will be twisted(oops, interpreted) to <br />one's <br />    convenience regardless of any logic(as we have seen already); so <br />    imo, its just a waste of our time to continue this discussion. <br />So <br />    this is a definite fullstop!</p>

<p>    Just one more time. No one in this group is for even a minute <br />    claiming that every other religion is better then Hinduism. Are <br />    there things that are wrong with Hinduism? Yes. <br />    Are there things that are wrong with other religions? Yes</p>
<p>    So shall we blindly compare other religions or look forward and <br />do <br />    the right thing? Up to us.</p>

<p>      The problem I have with the DK/DMK crowd, is that all their <br />    criticism<br />      is about Hinduism. They don't seem to extend their arguments <br />to <br />    other<br />      religions. A possible reason could be that Hindus tend to <br />shrug <br />  off<br />      criticisms about their religion whereas the Muslims and Xtians <br />    might<br />      react in a more reactionary manner (I AM putting it very <br />mildly <br />    here).</p>
<p>      There was this whole issue of people from other religions not <br />  being<br />      allowed to enter temples. Heck, if you go to Saudi Arabia, you <br />  are <br />    not<br />      even allowed to worship any of your gods in their country. How <br />    about<br />      that?</p>

<p>        ***************<br />        IX.<br />        PRAYERS AND IMPRECATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF THE BRAHMANS.</p>
<p>        V, 19. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.</p>
<p>        1. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of <br />  touching <br />    the<br />        heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the <br />    Sri?gaya<br />        Vaitahavyas.<br />        2. The persons who pierced Brihats?man, the descendant of <br />    Angiras, the<br />        Br?hmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured <br />their <br />    offspring.<br />        3. They who spat upon the Br?hmana, who desired tribute from <br />    him, they<br />        sit in the middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.<br />        4. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she <br />reaches <br />    does<br />        she destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born <br />    (there).<br />        5. A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter, her meat, <br />  when <br />    eaten,<br />        is sapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted <br />a <br />    crime<br />        against the Fathers.<br />        6. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy <br />  the<br />        Br?hmana, then royal power is dissipated, where the Br?hmana <br />  is <br />    oppressed.<br />        7. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed,<br />        two-mouthed, two-tongued, she dispels the rule of the <br />  oppressor <br />    of the<br />        Brahman.<br />        8. That (kingdom) surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship;         misfortune strikes that kingdom, in which they injure a <br />  Br?hmana.<br />        9. The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within <br />our<br />        shade,' him who covets the wealth that belongs to a <br />Br?hmana, <br />  O <br />    N?rada!<br />        10. King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison, prepared by <br />  the <br />    gods:<br />        no one who has devoured the cow of a Br?hmana retains the <br />  charge <br />    of a<br />        kingdom.<br />        11. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, <br />    because<br />        they had injured the offspring of a Br?hmana, were ruined <br />    irretrievably.<br />        12. The k?d?-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the <br />track <br />  (of<br />        death), which they fasten to the dead, that very one, O <br />    oppressor of<br />        Brahmans, the gods did declare (to be) thy couch.<br />        13. The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the <br />  oppressed<br />        (Brahman), as he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of <br />    Brahmans,<br />        the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<br />        14. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which <br />they <br />    moisten<br />        his beard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods <br />  did <br />    assign<br />        to thee as thy share of water.<br />        15. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the <br />  oppressor <br />    of<br />        Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him, he does <br />not <br />    guide<br />        his friend according to his will.</p>
<p>        Well, why these things r not for a normal human being? Why <br />it <br />  is <br />    only<br />        for brahmans? Isnt it partial?</p>
<p>        ***********************************<br />          Casteism is not in hinduism.In vedas <br />you <br />    wont see<br />          the name of any caste.In imposed varnas on the base of the <br />  job <br />    you<br />          do and said "vasudeva kudumbakam" and "sathyam ekam vipra,"<br />          meaning "god is one,whole universe is his family" which <br />was <br />    later<br />          sung by thirumular as "onre kulam,oruvane devan" <br />        ************************************</p>
<p>        what r the followingg things about??<br />        ----<br />        ?PASTAMBA PRASNA I, PATALA 1, KHANDA, 1.</p>
<p>        1. Now, therefore, we will declare the acts productive of <br />  merit <br />    which<br />        form part of the customs of daily life, as they have been <br />    settled by<br />        the agreement (of those who know the law).</p>
<p>        2. The authority (for these duties) is the agreement of <br />those <br />    who know<br />        the law,</p>
<p>        3. And (the authorities for the latter are) the Vedas alone.</p>
<p>        4. (There are) four castes--Br?hmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, <br />  and <br />    S?dras.</p>
<p>        5. Amongst these, each preceding (caste) is superior by <br />birth <br />  to <br />    the<br />        one following.</p>
<p>        6. (For all these), excepting S?dras and those who have <br />    committed bad<br />        actions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the <br />Veda, <br />    and the<br />        kindling of<br />        ----</p>
<p>        Hiduism survived for this many years, bcos 60-70% people were<br />        beneficiaries. And the rest 30%(dalits) directly depended on <br />  the<br />        Forward caste and backward caste people. Now the case is <br />    changing and<br />        majority of dalits r ready to give up their religion.</p>
<p>        For 1000s of years people were encouraged to practice <br />casteism <br />    in the<br />        name of religion.</p>
<p>        ****<br />        when US was at its height of<br />        slavery,slavery was justified by invoking bible.Does that <br />mean <br />    that<br />        bible is to be blamed?No.Criminals use religion as a mask in <br />  all<br />        religions.It happened in hinduism also.<br />        ***<br />        So, according to ur defenition majority of higher caste and <br />  other<br />        non-dalit people who represent hindu religion were(are) <br />    criminals.<br />        Isnt it?</p>

<p>  Agreed. It is just that in our Indian "secular" context religious<br />  criticism is usually always "Hindu" criticism. If the discussion is<br />  general and examines all religions under the same critical light, I<br />  have absolutely no problems.</p>
<p>  There are any number of things wrong with all religions (maybe <br />more in<br />  the observance and practice of the religions than in the religions<br />  themselves). I strongly believe in taking the "good" from all <br />things,<br />  regardless of their origins. :-)</p>
<p>  With regards to the Kanchi seer, I agree with Cho's statement. The<br />  govt. would not have taken the step of actually arresting him <br />unless<br />  it had some rather clinching evidence against him. Let the law take<br />  its course I say.</p>
<p>  Having said that, I just hope that the government is consistent <br />when<br />  it comes to dealing with important personages from other "minority"<br />  communities when such cases arise. (Of course you can see from this<br />  that I am all for the Uniform Civil Code but that's a discussion <br />for<br />  another day I suppose!)</p>

<p>Well, what u r saying is, hinduism never had casteism. Some people<br />manipulated it. Consider it as a case, how many people manipulated<br />it?1, 100 ,1000 or 100000??? Bcos it has been preached and it has been<br />and is being followed in each and every corner of india for 1000s of<br />years. <br />I am sorry to say this again , again and again.</p>
<p>In these 2000-3000 years, I can see that only very few (ramanujar and<br />whoelse??????) religious scholars raised their voice against casteism.<br />If majority of brahmanas( I mean only the saints) raised their voice<br />against casteism,then it could never existed. </p>
<p>And it is very easy to say that, no no my religion never preached any<br />bad thing, only 99% of people who followed my religion got confused a<br /><acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  for 3000 years and still 80-90% people r confused.  </p>
<p>It is very easy to be proud of a religion by being born in upper<br />caste. Its not same for a lower caste (dalit) guy. It just gives a<br />bitter taste. If u people feel that i am wrong and I am just making<br />some buzz, then I wont talk abt this again.</p>

        <p>Hi Veena,</p>
<p>Agreed. It is just that in our Indian "secular" context religious<br />criticism is usually always "Hindu" criticism. If the discussion is<br />general and examines all religions under the same critical light, I<br />have absolutely no problems.</p>
<p>There are any number of things wrong with all religions (maybe more in<br />the observance and practice of the religions than in the religions<br />themselves). I strongly believe in taking the "good" from all things,<br />regardless of their origins. :-)</p>
<p>With regards to the Kanchi seer, I agree with Cho's statement. The<br />govt. would not have taken the step of actually arresting him unless<br />it had some rather clinching evidence against him. Let the law take<br />its course I say.</p>
<p>Having said that, I just hope that the government is consistent when<br />it comes to dealing with important personages from other "minority"<br />communities when such cases arise. (Of course you can see from this<br />that I am all for the Uniform Civil Code but that's a discussion for<br />another day I suppose!)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>    The problem I have with the DK/DMK crowd, is that all their <br />  criticism<br />    is about Hinduism. They don't seem to extend their arguments to <br />  other<br />    religions. A possible reason could be that Hindus tend to shrug <br />off<br />    criticisms about their religion whereas the Muslims and Xtians <br />  might<br />    react in a more reactionary manner (I AM putting it very mildly <br />  here).</p>
<p>    There was this whole issue of people from other religions not <br />being<br />    allowed to enter temples. Heck, if you go to Saudi Arabia, you <br />are <br />  not<br />    even allowed to worship any of your gods in their country. How <br />  about<br />    that?</p>

<p>      Some quotes from atharva veda here,</p>
<p>      ***************<br />      IX.<br />      PRAYERS AND IMPRECATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF THE BRAHMANS.</p>
<p>      V, 19. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.</p>
<p>      1. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of <br />touching <br />  the<br />      heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the <br />  Sri?gaya<br />      Vaitahavyas.<br />      2. The persons who pierced Brihats?man, the descendant of <br />  Angiras, the<br />      Br?hmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their <br />  offspring.<br />      3. They who spat upon the Br?hmana, who desired tribute from <br />  him, they<br />      sit in the middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.<br />      4. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches <br />  does<br />      she destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born <br />  (there).<br />      5. A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter, her meat, <br />when <br />  eaten,<br />      is sapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a <br />  crime<br />      against the Fathers.<br />      6. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy <br />the<br />      Br?hmana, then royal power is dissipated, where the Br?hmana <br />is <br />  oppressed.<br />      7. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed,<br />      two-mouthed, two-tongued, she dispels the rule of the <br />oppressor <br />  of the<br />      Brahman.<br />      8. That (kingdom) surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship;       misfortune strikes that kingdom, in which they injure a <br />Br?hmana.<br />      9. The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within our<br />      shade,' him who covets the wealth that belongs to a Br?hmana, <br />O <br />  N?rada!<br />      10. King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison, prepared by <br />the <br />  gods:<br />      no one who has devoured the cow of a Br?hmana retains the <br />charge <br />  of a<br />      kingdom.<br />      11. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, <br />  because<br />      they had injured the offspring of a Br?hmana, were ruined <br />  irretrievably.<br />      12. The k?d?-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the track <br />(of<br />      death), which they fasten to the dead, that very one, O <br />  oppressor of<br />      Brahmans, the gods did declare (to be) thy couch.<br />      13. The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the <br />oppressed<br />      (Brahman), as he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of <br />  Brahmans,<br />      the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<br />      14. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they <br />  moisten<br />      his beard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods <br />did <br />  assign<br />      to thee as thy share of water.<br />      15. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the <br />oppressor <br />  of<br />      Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him, he does not <br />  guide<br />      his friend according to his will.</p>
<p>      Well, why these things r not for a normal human being? Why it <br />is <br />  only<br />      for brahmans? Isnt it partial?</p>
<p>      ***********************************<br />        Casteism is not in hinduism.In vedas you <br />  wont see<br />        the name of any caste.In imposed varnas on the base of the <br />job <br />  you<br />        do and said "vasudeva kudumbakam" and "sathyam ekam vipra,"<br />        meaning "god is one,whole universe is his family" which was <br />  later<br />        sung by thirumular as "onre kulam,oruvane devan" <br />      ************************************</p>
<p>      what r the followingg things about??<br />      ----<br />      ?PASTAMBA PRASNA I, PATALA 1, KHANDA, 1.</p>
<p>      1. Now, therefore, we will declare the acts productive of <br />merit <br />  which<br />      form part of the customs of daily life, as they have been <br />  settled by<br />      the agreement (of those who know the law).</p>
<p>      2. The authority (for these duties) is the agreement of those <br />  who know<br />      the law,</p>
<p>      3. And (the authorities for the latter are) the Vedas alone.</p>
<p>      4. (There are) four castes--Br?hmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, <br />and <br />  S?dras.</p>
<p>      5. Amongst these, each preceding (caste) is superior by birth <br />to <br />  the<br />      one following.</p>
<p>      6. (For all these), excepting S?dras and those who have <br />  committed bad<br />      actions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the Veda, <br />  and the<br />      kindling of<br />      ----</p>
<p>      Hiduism survived for this many years, bcos 60-70% people were<br />      beneficiaries. And the rest 30%(dalits) directly depended on <br />the<br />      Forward caste and backward caste people. Now the case is <br />  changing and<br />      majority of dalits r ready to give up their religion.</p>
<p>      For 1000s of years people were encouraged to practice casteism <br />  in the<br />      name of religion.</p>
<p>      ****<br />      when US was at its height of<br />      slavery,slavery was justified by invoking bible.Does that mean <br />  that<br />      bible is to be blamed?No.Criminals use religion as a mask in <br />all<br />      religions.It happened in hinduism also.<br />      ***<br />      So, according to ur defenition majority of higher caste and <br />other<br />      non-dalit people who represent hindu religion were(are) <br />  criminals.<br />      Isnt it?</p>

        <p>dear priya</p>
<p>If you understand that bhramins is not the name of a caste and is the name of saints it becomes simple.Many people like <br />viswamithra(ksathriya),vyasa(son of a fisherwoman),valmigi(hunter <br />and thief)became bhramins by meditation and prayer.In later days it <br />got twisted into castes by birth.</p>
<p>Lord Krishna does not say guna and karma of previous life. In sloka <br />(XVIII.41) Lord Krishna says "Brahmana Kshatriya visham sudranam <br />chaparamtapa, karmani pravibhaktani svabhavaprabhavaigunaih."</p>
<p>But the same Krishna was quiet when Karna was insulted as Suthra Putra inspite of Knowing the truth.</p>
<p>Drona was deemed to be a great brahman but he took the fingers off Ekaleva after refusing to teach him because he was not a Kshathriya and when he learnt the tricks by watching....this was to prevent any competetion for arjuna his favorite pupil.</p>
<p>The learned Vidhura was never respected as a brahman becuse he was born to a sudra...he is even termed suthra puthra.....</p>
<p>Kripacharya and Drona both refused karna permission to challenge arjuna because he was a sudra if the social strata was based on present birth and actions and there was no one as a ble as karna to be called Kshatriya...</p>
<p>So all these examples are from Vyasa's mahabharat and though he says something in the voice of Krishna as Bhagvat Gita..its not what he has written in the book....</p>
<p>birth, son of an engineer is not an engineer by birth, son of an IFS <br />officer cannot be called an IFS officer by birth.</p>
<p>But Drona's son aswathama was given all the liberties of a brahman by birth??!!!</p>

<p>Nobody will have a problem if the ills are highlighted in a positive <br />manner - with a view to changing for the better</p>
<p>but do you honestly believe this is happening</p>
<p>the criticism is mainly led by groups which are interested in the <br />demise of hinduism not in its betterment</p>

<p>Just one more time. No one in this group is for even a minute <br />claiming that every other religion is better then Hinduism. Are <br />there things that are wrong with Hinduism? Yes. <br />Are there things that are wrong with other religions? Yes</p>

However, is it any worse than other religions dividing the<br />  entire world into "believers" and "heathens/kafirs"?</p>
<p>  The problem I have with the DK/DMK crowd, is that all their <br />criticism<br />  is about Hinduism. They don't seem to extend their arguments to <br />other<br />  religions. A possible reason could be that Hindus tend to shrug off<br />  criticisms about their religion whereas the Muslims and Xtians <br />might<br />  react in a more reactionary manner (I AM putting it very mildly <br />here).</p>
<p>  There was this whole issue of people from other religions not being<br />  allowed to enter temples. Heck, if you go to Saudi Arabia, you are <br />not<br />  even allowed to worship any of your gods in their country. How <br />about<br />  that?</p>

<p>    Some quotes from atharva veda here,</p>
<p>    ***************<br />    IX.<br />    PRAYERS AND IMPRECATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF THE BRAHMANS.</p>
<p>    V, 19. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.</p>
<p>    1. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of touching <br />the<br />    heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the <br />Sri?gaya<br />    Vaitahavyas.<br />    2. The persons who pierced Brihats?man, the descendant of <br />Angiras, the<br />    Br?hmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their <br />offspring.<br />    3. They who spat upon the Br?hmana, who desired tribute from <br />him, they<br />    sit in the middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.<br />    4. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches <br />does<br />    she destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born <br />(there).<br />    5. A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter, her meat, when <br />eaten,<br />    is sapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a <br />crime<br />    against the Fathers.<br />    6. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy the<br />    Br?hmana, then royal power is dissipated, where the Br?hmana is <br />oppressed.<br />    7. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed,<br />    two-mouthed, two-tongued, she dispels the rule of the oppressor <br />of the<br />    Brahman.<br />    8. That (kingdom) surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship;     misfortune strikes that kingdom, in which they injure a Br?hmana.<br />    9. The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within our<br />    shade,' him who covets the wealth that belongs to a Br?hmana, O <br />N?rada!<br />    10. King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison, prepared by the <br />gods:<br />    no one who has devoured the cow of a Br?hmana retains the charge <br />of a<br />    kingdom.<br />    11. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, <br />because<br />    they had injured the offspring of a Br?hmana, were ruined <br />irretrievably.<br />    12. The k?d?-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the track (of<br />    death), which they fasten to the dead, that very one, O <br />oppressor of<br />    Brahmans, the gods did declare (to be) thy couch.<br />    13. The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the oppressed<br />    (Brahman), as he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of <br />Brahmans,<br />    the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<br />    14. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they <br />moisten<br />    his beard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did <br />assign<br />    to thee as thy share of water.<br />    15. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the oppressor <br />of<br />    Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him, he does not <br />guide<br />    his friend according to his will.</p>
<p>    Well, why these things r not for a normal human being? Why it is <br />only<br />    for brahmans? Isnt it partial?</p>
<p>    ***********************************<br />      Casteism is not in hinduism.In vedas you <br />wont see<br />      the name of any caste.In imposed varnas on the base of the job <br />you<br />      do and said "vasudeva kudumbakam" and "sathyam ekam vipra,"<br />      meaning "god is one,whole universe is his family" which was <br />later<br />      sung by thirumular as "onre kulam,oruvane devan" <br />    ************************************</p>
<p>    what r the followingg things about??<br />    ----<br />    ?PASTAMBA PRASNA I, PATALA 1, KHANDA, 1.</p>
<p>    1. Now, therefore, we will declare the acts productive of merit <br />which<br />    form part of the customs of daily life, as they have been <br />settled by<br />    the agreement (of those who know the law).</p>
<p>    2. The authority (for these duties) is the agreement of those <br />who know<br />    the law,</p>
<p>    3. And (the authorities for the latter are) the Vedas alone.</p>
<p>    4. (There are) four castes--Br?hmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and <br />S?dras.</p>
<p>    5. Amongst these, each preceding (caste) is superior by birth to <br />the<br />    one following.</p>
<p>    6. (For all these), excepting S?dras and those who have <br />committed bad<br />    actions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the Veda, <br />and the<br />    kindling of<br />    ----</p>
<p>    Hiduism survived for this many years, bcos 60-70% people were<br />    beneficiaries. And the rest 30%(dalits) directly depended on the<br />    Forward caste and backward caste people. Now the case is <br />changing and<br />    majority of dalits r ready to give up their religion.</p>
<p>    For 1000s of years people were encouraged to practice casteism <br />in the<br />    name of religion.</p>
<p>    ****<br />    when US was at its height of<br />    slavery,slavery was justified by invoking bible.Does that mean <br />that<br />    bible is to be blamed?No.Criminals use religion as a mask in all<br />    religions.It happened in hinduism also.<br />    ***<br />    So, according to ur defenition majority of higher caste and other<br />    non-dalit people who represent hindu religion were(are) <br />criminals.<br />    Isnt it?</p>

<p>Who does he then praise in the first ten kurals?<br />After that everywhere he praises various vedic concepts.This <br />indicates that initially he worshipped only vedic god.And once it is <br />clear that he worshipped a vedic god it doesnt matter whether it is <br />vishnu or shiva or ganesh.Since vedas clearly say "sathyam ekam <br />vipra"(god is one)</p>

<p>If you understand that bhramins is not the name of <br />a caste and is the name of saints it becomes simple.Many people like <br />viswamithra(ksathriya),vyasa(son of a fisherwoman),valmigi(hunter <br />and thief)became bhramins by meditation and prayer.In later days it <br />got twisted into castes by birth.</p>

<p>Where did you get this?See whats written in bhagavad <br />geetha about castes.</p>
<p>In sloka (IV.13) Lord Krishna says: "Chaturvarnyma mayaa <br />sristam gunkarma vibhagsah" i.e. four orders of society created by <br />Me according to their Guna (qualities/behaviour) and Karma<br />(profession/work/efforts).<br />Lord Krishna does not say guna and karma of previous life. In sloka <br />(XVIII.41) Lord Krishna says "Brahmana Kshatriya visham sudranam <br />chaparamtapa, karmani pravibhaktani svabhavaprabhavaigunaih."</p>
<p>It means people have been grouped into four classes according to <br />their present life karma (profession/work) and svabhava (behaviour).<br />`The division of labour into four categories - Brahman, <br />Ksatriya,Vaishya and Sudra - is also based on the Gunas inherent in <br />peoples'nature`. Had this division been based on birth, Lord Krishna <br />would have naturally used phrase 'Janmani pravibhaktani' in the very <br />shloka<br />(XVIII.41).</p>
<p>In sloka (XVIII.42), Lord Krishna prescribes duties (karma) which <br />one must do in order to qualify as a Brahman i.e. among other duties <br />(karma), he must have studied Vedas and must teach Vedas to others.<br />Thus, if a person has neither studied Veda, nor teaches Veda to <br />others, he is not a Brahman.</p>
<p>Brahman categorisation is an acquirement through efforts like <br />present day degrees of MA, MBBS etc. A teacher's son cannot be <br />called a teacher by birth, a General's son is not a general by <br />birth, son of an engineer is not an engineer by birth, son of an IFS <br />officer cannot be called an IFS officer by birth.</p>
<p>""So, according to ur defenition majority of higher caste and other<br />non-dalit people who represent hindu religion were(are) criminals.<br />Isnt it?""</p>
<p>Whoever twisted vedas and enslaved people on basis of <br />birth is a ignorant person who would have paid for that sin to god.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I have refrained from entering into the current "debate" till now.<br />However, I would like to suggest that if "religion" is being<br />discussed, then we do it as a whole and not just focussed on Hinduism.<br />For example, I agree caste is bad and that it is a blight on Hinduism.<br />Great.. However, is it any worse than other religions dividing the<br />entire world into "believers" and "heathens/kafirs"?</p>
<p>The problem I have with the DK/DMK crowd, is that all their criticism<br />is about Hinduism. They don't seem to extend their arguments to other<br />religions. A possible reason could be that Hindus tend to shrug off<br />criticisms about their religion whereas the Muslims and Xtians might<br />react in a more reactionary manner (I AM putting it very mildly here).</p>
<p>There was this whole issue of people from other religions not being<br />allowed to enter temples. Heck, if you go to Saudi Arabia, you are not<br />even allowed to worship any of your gods in their country. How about<br />that?</p>
<p>Let the arguments/counter arguments begin :p</p>

<p>  Some quotes from atharva veda here,</p>
<p>  ***************<br />  IX.<br />  PRAYERS AND IMPRECATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF THE BRAHMANS.</p>
<p>  V, 19. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.</p>
<p>  1. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of touching the<br />  heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the Sri?gaya<br />  Vaitahavyas.<br />  2. The persons who pierced Brihats?man, the descendant of Angiras, the<br />  Br?hmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their offspring.<br />  3. They who spat upon the Br?hmana, who desired tribute from him, they<br />  sit in the middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.<br />  4. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches does<br />  she destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born (there).<br />  5. A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter, her meat, when eaten,<br />  is sapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a crime<br />  against the Fathers.<br />  6. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy the<br />  Br?hmana, then royal power is dissipated, where the Br?hmana is oppressed.<br />  7. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed,<br />  two-mouthed, two-tongued, she dispels the rule of the oppressor of the<br />  Brahman.<br />  8. That (kingdom) surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship;   misfortune strikes that kingdom, in which they injure a Br?hmana.<br />  9. The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within our<br />  shade,' him who covets the wealth that belongs to a Br?hmana, O N?rada!<br />  10. King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison, prepared by the gods:<br />  no one who has devoured the cow of a Br?hmana retains the charge of a<br />  kingdom.<br />  11. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, because<br />  they had injured the offspring of a Br?hmana, were ruined irretrievably.<br />  12. The k?d?-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the track (of<br />  death), which they fasten to the dead, that very one, O oppressor of<br />  Brahmans, the gods did declare (to be) thy couch.<br />  13. The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the oppressed<br />  (Brahman), as he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of Brahmans,<br />  the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<br />  14. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they moisten<br />  his beard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign<br />  to thee as thy share of water.<br />  15. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the oppressor of<br />  Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him, he does not guide<br />  his friend according to his will.</p>
<p>  Well, why these things r not for a normal human being? Why it is only<br />  for brahmans? Isnt it partial?</p>
<p>  ***********************************<br />    Casteism is not in hinduism.In vedas you wont see<br />    the name of any caste.In imposed varnas on the base of the job you<br />    do and said "vasudeva kudumbakam" and "sathyam ekam vipra,"<br />    meaning "god is one,whole universe is his family" which was later<br />    sung by thirumular as "onre kulam,oruvane devan" <br />  ************************************</p>
<p>  what r the followingg things about??<br />  ----<br />  ?PASTAMBA PRASNA I, PATALA 1, KHANDA, 1.</p>
<p>  1. Now, therefore, we will declare the acts productive of merit which<br />  form part of the customs of daily life, as they have been settled by<br />  the agreement (of those who know the law).</p>
<p>  2. The authority (for these duties) is the agreement of those who know<br />  the law,</p>
<p>  3. And (the authorities for the latter are) the Vedas alone.</p>
<p>  4. (There are) four castes--Br?hmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and S?dras.</p>
<p>  5. Amongst these, each preceding (caste) is superior by birth to the<br />  one following.</p>
<p>  6. (For all these), excepting S?dras and those who have committed bad<br />  actions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the Veda, and the<br />  kindling of<br />  ----</p>
<p>  Hiduism survived for this many years, bcos 60-70% people were<br />  beneficiaries. And the rest 30%(dalits) directly depended on the<br />  Forward caste and backward caste people. Now the case is changing and<br />  majority of dalits r ready to give up their religion.</p>
<p>  For 1000s of years people were encouraged to practice casteism in the<br />  name of religion.</p>
<p>  ****<br />  when US was at its height of<br />  slavery,slavery was justified by invoking bible.Does that mean that<br />  bible is to be blamed?No.Criminals use religion as a mask in all<br />  religions.It happened in hinduism also.<br />  ***<br />  So, according to ur defenition majority of higher caste and other<br />  non-dalit people who represent hindu religion were(are) criminals.<br />  Isnt it?</p>

<p>6. (For all these), excepting S?dras and those who have committed bad<br />actions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the Veda, and the<br />kindling of<br />----</p>
<p>Hiduism survived for this many years, bcos 60-70% people were<br />beneficiaries. And the rest 30%(dalits) directly depended on the<br />Forward caste and backward caste people. Now the case is changing and<br />majority of dalits r ready to give up their religion.</p>
<p>For 1000s of years people were encouraged to practice casteism in the<br />name of religion. </p>
<p>****<br />when US was at its height of<br />slavery,slavery was justified by invoking bible.Does that mean that<br />bible is to be blamed?No.Criminals use religion as a mask in all<br />religions.It happened in hinduism also.<br />***<br />So, according to ur defenition majority of higher caste and other<br />non-dalit people who represent hindu religion were(are) criminals.<br />Isnt it? </p>

          all can enter temples?No way.--veens        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>1) Kural never preaches casteism. </p>
<p>"Marapinum othukollal agum,PAARPAN PIRAPOLUKKAM kundra kedum"</p>
<p>"ANDHANAR enbor aravor,evvuyirkum sendhanmai poondolugalan"</p>
<p>"aa payan kundrum,ARUTHOLILOR NOOL marappar,kavalan kaavan <br />enin"</p>
<p>Arutholilor indicates bhramins.Vedas called them as "shatkarma <br />nirathar" meaning bhramins have 6 duties.Valluvar translated it as <br />arutholilor(people with 6 duties).He also says "NOOL (vedas) <br />marappar" indicating that bhramins forgeting vedas is an undesirable <br />thing.</p>
<p>what do these kurals mean?</p>
<p>2) Kural treats all the lives in same way. i.e. There is no animal<br />considered as holy animal.</p>
<p>Valluvar indicates what are the consequences of a bad ruler as <br />follows.He starts of with cows "Aa payan kundrum" and continues it <br />with "arutholilor nool marappar" indicating that the greatest bad <br />thing that can happen when a king is bad is "cows reducing their <br />milk secretion".The second badest thing is bhramins forgeting <br />vedas.He doesnt even talk about law and order here.These two things <br />concern him more than anything.See how he puts cows even before <br />bhramins and vedas.</p>
<p>"AA payan kundrum arutholilor nool marappar kavalan kaavan enin"</p>
<p>3) There is "tamarai kannaan ulagam" in 1103rd kural. If it is <br />taken as thirumal, he is clearly not praising thirumal.</p>
<p>Is he not?"Tamarai kannan"--see the words.He <br />is not just praising krishna.He is simply adoring the beauty of the <br />eyes of narayana in a poetic way.In all other sangam literatures <br />narayana is called as hari and thirumal.But here valluvar cajoles <br />him like a kid.Why did not valluvar just say "thiruaml vaal ulagu" <br />or even shortly as "vaikunda"?I only see valluvar konjufying krishna <br />as his kid in this kural.</p>
<p>Even leaving apart this sentimental view of <br />mine that kural says "Is the world of hari better than this <br />woman?".Here too i see him glorifying vaikunda.Even kambar used this <br />technique.When bharatha is about to jump in fire kousalya stops him <br />and says "I can live withour Ram,but not without you.PALAKODI <br />RAMANUM unakku inayagan".See how kambar hailes baratha as.Ramayanam <br />is about rama.The book itself contains ramas name.Rama is none other <br />than thirumal.Kambar is the staunchest devotee of narasimma.Such a <br />man hails bharatha as "palakodi ramanum unakku inayagan".Does this <br />mean that kambar is not praising rama?when you priase somebody you <br />will compare them only with the thing you value the most.For kambar <br />it was ram.For valluvar it was narayana.</p>
<p>4) It treats all the people in same way. In vedas its not the case. </p>
<p>Is it so?Please show such vedic quotes <br />where it says people are inferior?</p>
<p>things. It is just how u look at the things.""</p>
<p>Go nowhere.See thirukural.He sung 3 <br />concepts aram,porul and inbam.He placed aram in front of everything <br />else.And how does he start even the arathupal?He starts off with <br />praying to god.And which is the god whom he worships first?Its his <br />mother.Then he proceeds to worship his father.Then in the next 9 <br />kurals he worships god.Then he narrates aram in the next chapters.</p>
<p>He wanted us to worship god first,seek aram next,seek porul <br />afterwards and seek inbam at the end.This is his hierarchy.If you <br />are being selective in following him its not his mistake.</p>
<p>" I am a hindu by birth and living in TN. I can see how a fellow man <br />is treated by the name of caste. Everybody agrees that casteism is <br />a bad thing. But how many people have given up the caste? Still <br />majority of people r proud to identify themself with their caste <br />name. Still casteism plays a major role in majority of hindus <br />life. I cant be proud to call myself as hindu when I see a fellow <br />man suffers by the name of religion.In my opinion religion just <br />divides people."""</p>
<p>what is the thing that unites people then?Marx <br />tried it by removing all hierarchies in the society and he failed <br />badly and his followers established the most ruthless regime in the <br />process.Hierarchies will not disappear just by you wishing them to <br />disappear.Saying "religion divides people" is fashionable <br />nowadays.Income,age,sex,occupation,language,country..so many things <br />do the same thing.Why not remove all this?</p>
<p>Casteism is not in hinduism.In vedas you wont see <br />the name of any caste.In imposed varnas on the base of the job you <br />do and said "vasudeva kudumbakam" and "sathyam ekam vipra," <br />meaning "god is one,whole universe is his family" which was later <br />sung by thirumular as "onre kulam,oruvane devan" and which later was <br />adapated as the motto of DMK.So DMK in end hailed vedic concept as <br />its motto.How funny can things become.</p>
