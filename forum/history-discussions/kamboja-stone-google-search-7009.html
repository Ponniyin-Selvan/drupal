<p>Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars: Encyclopedia - Ashvakas<br />The Ashvakas are very ancient people of north-east Afghanistan. They <br />find mention in the Puranas, Mahabharata and other ancient Sanskrit <br />and Pali literature. Sanskrit term ashva , Iranian aspa and Prakrit <br />assa means horse. The name Ashvaka or Assaka is said to be derived <br />from Sanskrit Ashva or Prakrit Assa and it litterally denotes <br />someone connected with the horses---hence: a horseman, or a <br />cavalryman. The Ashvakas were especially engaged in the occupation <br />of breeding, raising an ... </p>

<p>Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars: Encyclopedia II - <br />Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars<br />The Kambojas were basically a republican people. They were <br />constituted into military Sanghas and Corporations to manage their <br />affairs, as Kautiliya and Mahabharata amply attest for us. They are <br />also attested to be living as Ayuddha-jivi or Shastr-opajivis, which <br />means that the Kamboja cavalry offered its military services to <br />other nations as well. There are numerous references to Kambojas <br />being requistioned as cavalry troopers in ancient wars by outside <br />nations. A few illustrative references from ancient literature are <br />presented below to prove this point. &lt; ... </p>

<p>Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars: Encyclopedia II - <br />Ashvakas - Afghan and Ashvakan relationship<br />According to modern view, the name Afghan derives from Sanskrit <br />Ashvaka or Ashvakan, the Assakenoi of classical writings. McCrindle <br />observes: "The name Afghan has evidently been derived from Asvakan, <br />the Assakenoi of Arrian " (Megasthenes and Arrian, p 180; <br />Alexander's Invasion of India, p 38; J. W. McCrindle) Numerous <br />scholars like Christian Lassen, Saan Martin, L. Bishop, Dr Crooks, <br />Dr. J. C. Vidyalnar, Dr M. R. Singh, William Smith, N. L.

Their main concentrations were in <br />Kunar and Swat valleys on the north of river Kabol. Ancient Sanskrit <br />literature also refers to another clan called Ashmaka or Assaka <br />which represented an Indo-Aryan Janapada located on river Godavari <br />in south-west India.

<p>Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars: Encyclopedia II - <br />Ashvakas - More opinions from scholars<br />Sir Thomas H. Holdich, in the his classic book, The Gates of India, <br />writes that the Aspasians (Aspasios) represent the modern Kafirs <br />(The Gates of India, p 102-03). But the modern Kafirs, especially <br />the Siah-Posh Kafirs (Kamoz/Camoje, Kamtoz) etc are considered to be <br />modern representatives of the ancient Kambojas [1], this shows that <br />the Aspasios (Aspas), who were the western branch of the Assakenois <br />(Ashvakas) of classical writings, represented a section of the <br />Sanskrit Kambojas.

<p>    Dear Sivapathasekaran,</p>
<p>    There was a report in the Hindu News Paper of 20-11-2008, on the<br />    damages done to the Vyagrapurisvara temple at Tiruppulivanam - a <br />  news<br />    which is already known to many, including PS group members.</p>
<p>    The section which deals with the ancient paintings in same is<br />    extracted and given below. </p>
<p>    "......The Vyagrapurisvara temple at Tiruppulivanam, near<br />    Uttraramerur, 95 km from Chennai, was one of the three temples in<br />    Tamil Nadu where Chola paintings existed. The others where they <br />  still<br />    exist are the Brihadeesvara temple in Thanjavur and the <br />Vijayalaya<br />    Cholisvara temple near Pudukottai.</p>
<p>    What stood out were the Chola frescoes, painted perhaps during <br />the<br />    rule of Rajendra I, on the northern prakara wall. There were <br />  murals of<br />    Raja Raja Chola's teacher Karuvur Thevar and of princes, <br />  princesses,<br />    dancing girls, ponds with lily and lotus flowers and wild <br />animals.<br />    These frescoes do not exist today....."</p>
<p>    Could you very kindly let me know if you are aware if any <br />  enthusiastic<br />    person have already photographed these paintings of the above<br />    mentioned, before Sand Blasting damage has been done - which if<br />    available could be archived in Ponniyin Selvan - Files section <br />for<br />    those interested in the study of Chola Paintings to have a <br />glimpse <br />  at<br />    them.</p>
<p>    It will be a great service if any individual could compile the<br />    photographs of all the existing Chola period paintings in the<br />    Thanjavur Temple, Vijayalaya temple, and if avilable the<br />    Thirupullivanam Temple (and any other places ???)painting into a <br />  book<br />    with their critical study of same with introductory notes, for <br />the<br />    benefit of Chola History lovers, and also archive these Photos <br />  also in<br />    the PS group File section.</p>

Sanskrit term ashva , Iranian aspa and Prakrit <br />  assa means horse. The name Ashvaka or Assaka is said to be derived <br />  from Sanskrit Ashva or Prakrit Assa and it litterally denotes <br />  someone connected with the horses---hence: a horseman, or a <br />  cavalryman.

<p>  Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars: Encyclopedia II - <br />  Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars<br />  The Kambojas were basically a republican people. They were <br />  constituted into military Sanghas and Corporations to manage their <br />  affairs, as Kautiliya and Mahabharata amply attest for us. They are <br />  also attested to be living as Ayuddha-jivi or Shastr-opajivis, <br />which <br />  means that the Kamboja cavalry offered its military services to <br />  other nations as well. There are numerous references to Kambojas <br />  being requistioned as cavalry troopers in ancient wars by outside <br />  nations. A few illustrative references from ancient literature are <br />  presented below to prove this point. &lt; ... </p>

<p>  Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars: Encyclopedia - Ashvakas<br />  The Ashvakas are very ancient people of north-east Afghanistan. <br />They <br />  find mention in the Puranas, Mahabharata and other ancient Sanskrit <br />  and Pali literature. Sanskrit term ashva , Iranian aspa and Prakrit <br />  assa means horse. The name Ashvaka or Assaka is said to be derived <br />  from Sanskrit Ashva or Prakrit Assa and it litterally denotes <br />  someone connected with the horses---hence: a horseman, or a <br />  cavalryman. The Ashvakas were especially engaged in the occupation <br />  of breeding, raising an ... </p>

<p>  Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars: Encyclopedia II - <br />  Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars<br />  The Kambojas were basically a republican people. They were <br />  constituted into military Sanghas and Corporations to manage their <br />  affairs, as Kautiliya and Mahabharata amply attest for us. They are <br />  also attested to be living as Ayuddha-jivi or Shastr-opajivis, <br />which <br />  means that the Kamboja cavalry offered its military services to <br />  other nations as well. There are numerous references to Kambojas <br />  being requistioned as cavalry troopers in ancient wars by outside <br />  nations. A few illustrative references from ancient literature are <br />  presented below to prove this point. &lt; ... </p>

<p>  Ashvakas - Kamboja cavalry in ancient wars: Encyclopedia II - <br />  Ashvakas - Afghan and Ashvakan relationship<br />  According to modern view, the name Afghan derives from Sanskrit <br />  Ashvaka or Ashvakan, the Assakenoi of classical writings. McCrindle <br />  observes: "The name Afghan has evidently been derived from Asvakan, <br />  the Assakenoi of Arrian " (Megasthenes and Arrian, p 180; <br />  Alexander's Invasion of India, p 38; J. W. McCrindle) Numerous <br />  scholars like Christian Lassen, Saan Martin, L. Bishop, Dr Crooks, <br />  Dr. J. C. Vidyalnar, Dr M. R. Singh, William Smith, N. L.

Their main concentrations were in <br />  Kunar and Swat valleys on the north of river Kabol.
