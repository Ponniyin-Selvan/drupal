<blockquote><p>  A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY ON MEDIEVAL CHOLAS <br />  AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE CHERAS {KERALAS} OF THE CONTEMPORARY <br />  PERIOD {A.D.801 - A.D 1120} </p>
<p>  Introduction </p>
<p>  During the periods of the nineth and the tenth centuries, the Chera <br />  country was ruled by three principal royal dynasties known as the <br />  Ayes, Venads and Kulasekaras from three distinctive regions of Kerala <br />  (the Sanskritised version of Chera), and the kings of these three <br />  dynasties and the other Chieftains ruling small regions of rest of <br />  the Kerala, all were generally referred to as the Cheras or Keralas <br />  by the people of Chola &amp; Pandiya countries of this period. </p>
<p>  The Aye dynasty were ruling a region covering from the present <br />  Nagerkoil of Tamil Nadu the southern end of the Aye kingdom, upwards <br />  into Kerala to the present Anjuthengu in the north of the present <br />  Thiruvananthapuram, and was known as Aye Nadu. Their capital was at <br />  Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye Nadu <br />  also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic studies <br />  acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was located deep <br />  south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to Nagerkoil the <br />  southern end of the Aye kingdom. </p>
<p>  The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu covering a <br />  region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as Kollam <br />  Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport city on <br />  the west Kerala. </p>
<p>  The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond Kottayam <br />  further north upto and around the present region of Kolikkodu <br />  (Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital at <br />  Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as Makothai, and <br />  a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu country of <br />  that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil Nadu, <br />  bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under their <br />  rule during this period. </p>
<p>  Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory ruled by <br />  Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" under <br />  different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who accepted <br />  the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their respective <br />  regions as subordinates to them. </p>
<p>  The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya Chola </p>
<p>  Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a powerful <br />  Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in <br />  Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country covering the length of the Kolli -<br />  Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his capital <br />  at Mahodayapuram. </p>
<p>  He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />  nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur (the <br />  Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the Pandiya <br />  country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably during <br />  this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the Kulasekara <br />  dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to rule over <br />  this region. </p>
<p>  Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as an <br />  incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of this period <br />  referred to him as Kulasekara Perumal in reverence. </p>
<p>  He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in Cholanadu, and <br />  Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, and has <br />  composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu named <br />  as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda Mala". He <br />  abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was venerated as <br />  one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the <br />  Kulasekara Alvar. </p>
<p>  The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. With <br />  the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son Rajasekaran<br />  {A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was also known <br />  by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an ardent <br />  devotee of God Siva. </p>
<p>  Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram spent <br />  most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at the <br />  Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) in the <br />  Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great Tamil Saiva <br />  Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a pilgrimage to <br />  the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera king <br />  Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva Saint, <br />  also went to Thiruvarur at this same time. </p>
<p>  Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera king <br />  composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as "Mummanikkovai". From <br />  there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar to the <br />  Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other Siva <br />  Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further hyms in <br />  Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponnvanna Anthathi" <br />  and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and venerated <br />  as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by him have <br />  been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a <br />  collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by various <br />  Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala State). </p>
<p>  Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar the <br />  Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the palace of <br />  this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the Chera <br />  country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam <br />  (Udagai) region of TamilNadu. </p>
<p>  While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar died. <br />  Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the <br />  Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in the <br />  same year. </p>
<p>  It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and partly <br />  during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great Saiva <br />  Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who founded <br />  the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala. </p>
<p>  It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal from <br />  Venad in the Chera country though not classified under the sixty-<br />  three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by him <br />  named `Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola country, <br />  has been included in the nineth Thirumurai. It appears the Venattu <br />  Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the <br />  Sundaramurthi Nayanar. </p>
<p>  The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was followed <br />  by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma Kulasekaran (alias <br />  Ko-Kandan) (A.D.844 - 885) on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram. <br />  Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had a daughter by <br />  the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva from another <br />  Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala. </p>
<p>  It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, the Chola <br />  dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in partial or <br />  total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for nearly six <br />  centuries. </p>
<p>  Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881} </p>
<p>  The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into prominance <br />  was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}, who ruled the Chola <br />  country from Thanjavur. </p>
<p>  It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very friendly <br />  relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his daughter <br />  both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good relations <br />  that existed with the Chola country, had made their endowments to the <br />  Siva temples in the Chola country </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu Ravi <br />  also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravarti Kulasekaradeva, the <br />  villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named Satanur in <br />  the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as Tiruayanisuramudaiya <br />  Nayanar. </p>
<p>  The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the temple of <br />  Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) in the <br />  year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu Ravi also <br />  gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in <br />  Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870. </p>
<p>  Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his son <br />  Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, who was <br />  a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of his rule <br />  the Athitha Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the Chera king <br />  Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king. </p>
<p>  A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was greatly <br />  instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was rewarded <br />  jointly by the Chola &amp; Chera kings with a crown, palace, elephants, <br />  royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan Thamil Verl". </p>
<p>  Towards the middle of Athitha Chola's rule the Chera king Sthani Ravi <br />  died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara{A.D.885-917} on the <br />  Chera throne. </p>
<p>  During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan (A.D.860-<br />  905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to them was <br />  born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920). </p>
<p>  Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907-953} </p>
<p>  Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-953) <br />  on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan Adigal <br />  daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. He also <br />  married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar Kandan <br />  Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the present <br />  Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a further <br />  queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of the Venad <br />  King of the Chera country, who refer themselves as "Villavar'. </p>
<p>  Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named <br />  Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a younger son <br />  by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan. </p>
<p>  A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named Velankumaran <br />  was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the Prince <br />  Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu. </p>
<p>  Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the Pandiyanadu waged <br />  war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera king Rama <br />  Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha. </p>
<p>  Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the <br />  assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with Paranthaha and <br />  his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma at <br />  Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in Sri <br />  Lanka. </p>
<p>  As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri Lankan <br />  king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, returned to the <br />  Chera Country of his mother. </p>
<p>  The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the foremost among <br />  the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara dynasty, <br />  paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween these two <br />  countries to increase many folds. During this period there seems to <br />  have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola <br />  country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king. </p>
<p>  The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the queen of <br />  Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for lighting <br />  lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year A.D.923. </p>
<p>  In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-arisilar Kumaran a native of the <br />  Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala country <br />  gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in <br />  Kudumiyam\nmalai in Cholanadu </p>
<p>  In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of Malainadu <br />  gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in Cholanadu. </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold for <br />  lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in Thanjavur. </p>
<p>  She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named <br />  Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During her time <br />  a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present Pondicherry) <br />  and named after her as Kokkilanadi-pereri in Chola country. </p>
<p>  There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala Kurumban <br />  given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha Chola with the <br />  title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts to the the <br />  temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927. </p>
<p>  In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king <br />  Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier Chera king <br />  Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for lighting <br />  lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in Thondainadu <br />  which was under Chola rule. </p>
<p>  Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu <br />  (Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated a lamp <br />  to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam. </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince <br />  Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone temple to <br />  Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in Thondaimandalam. </p>
<p>  Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at Thirumalpuram in <br />  Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of Kodungolur <br />  (Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948. </p>
<p>  Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the <br />  presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur A.D.952 </p>
<p>  Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama Varma, the <br />  king Kothai Ravi Varma{A.D.917-947} succeeded on the Chera throne at <br />  Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country. </p>
<p>  After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by <br />  Indukotha Varma{A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram. </p>
<p>  Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957} </p>
<p>  After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola (A.D..950-<br />  957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with <br />  Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king his <br />  thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious life, <br />  and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil known <br />  as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the nineth <br />  Thirumurai.) </p>
<p>  Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957} </p>
<p>  He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded to the <br />  Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king the <br />  Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar. </p>
<p>  Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970} </p>
<p>  With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the Sundera Chola <br />  ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the Malaiyaman <br />  king of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar <br />  Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias Thiribhuvanamatheviyar and <br />  also Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and to the <br />  former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1. </p>
<p>  During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was succeeded by <br />  Bhaskara Ravi Varma -1{A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. Baskara Ravi <br />  Varma - 2{A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted Bhakara Ravi Varma ? <br />  1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which stretched from the present <br />  Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region encompassing the Kudamalainadu, <br />  Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-regent probably from Uthahai in the <br />  Kongu region which was under the Chera rule during this period. </p>
<p>  Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985} </p>
<p>  After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 was the <br />  legitimate heir to the Chola throne, but he whole heartedly gave way <br />  to Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola being <br />  his paternal uncle to rule for some period. </p>
<p>  Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named Panchavanmatheviyar who <br />  was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar known as Kandan <br />  Sundera Cholan. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014} </p>
<p>  Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by the heir <br />  apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D.985-1014} on the Chola throne. </p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman king of <br />  Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was also as <br />  Thiribhuvanamadevi. </p>
<p>  One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi the daughter of the king <br />  of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a queen known as <br />  Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of Paluvettaraiyar Kandan <br />  Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west of Thirutchirappalli <br />  bordering Kerala state. It was to this Vanavanmadevi the greatest <br />  emperor in the Chola history namely the Rajendra Chola ? 1 was born. </p>
<p>  With the accession of Rajaraja Chola-1 on the Chola throne and with <br />  his imperialistic ambitions over South India, found that it was <br />  necessary initially to overcome the powerfull Cheras. </p>
<p>  During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the Aye <br />  dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a <br />  military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur Salai <br />  which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced great <br />  trained warriors. </p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines of <br />  these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera(Kerala) <br />  country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an <br />  absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern region of <br />  the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull kings. </p>
<p>  Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in <br />  A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military <br />  acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again <br />  in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military <br />  acadamy and arsenal centre. </p>
<p>  This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the <br />  year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military <br />  acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of <br />  Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of Vilignam. </p>
<p>  The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The Rajaraja <br />  Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village called <br />  Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of <br />  Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu). </p>
<p>  Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants in the <br />  year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi (October/November) <br />  a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya <br />  nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the God at <br />  the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river and a <br />  perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day. </p>
<p>  He now turned his attention on his conquest of the territories in the <br />  Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the present <br />  Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja-1 thereafter sent an ambassador to the <br />  co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of Mahodai ruling from <br />  Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as Udagai), namely Baskara <br />  Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the family of Kulasekaras, <br />  requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty and to pay tributes. </p>
<p>  The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of Uthahai <br />  and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja Chola-1 who <br />  sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year A.D.1014 <br />  which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears Baskara <br />  Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu was controlled by Cholas. </p>
<p>  The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the north and <br />  central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara Ravivarman <br />  Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the <br />  Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram <br />  (Kodungolur). It appears Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 too accepted the <br />  Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in the <br />  Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the territories of <br />  Chera country ruled by the other chieftans which were under Baskara <br />  Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy. </p>
<p>  The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory (Kolladesam) <br />  and captured the the region along with its seaport capital the Kollam<br />  (proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain Govardhana <br />  Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the <br />  Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044} </p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was succeeeded by <br />  his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a co-<br />  regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012. </p>
<p>  During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year A.D.1019, with <br />  the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 of <br />  Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his second <br />  son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who defeated <br />  the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital Mahothai <br />  and secured his crown, diadem and an island called Santhimathivu <br />  belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic sea. In this war <br />  Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death. </p>
<p>  With the his securing of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? 1 <br />  assumed the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 gave the <br />  title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and appointed <br />  him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu of the <br />  Kerala country. </p>
<p>  However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war expedition <br />  with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera country <br />  in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera Keralan<br />  {A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule on accepting the <br />  Chola suzerainty. </p>
<p>  Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and his <br />  father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at Jayamaliswarem <br />  in A.D.1023 and built a Salai for providing food named as Chola-<br />  Keralan Chalai and for revenue for its expenses gifted a village <br />  named Chola-Kerala Nallur. </p>
<p>  Rajendra Chola ? 1 in memory of his mother after her death made a <br />  statue of herself and installed at the temple known as Sembianmathevi <br />  at Nagapattinam and made arrangements for its worship. In Sri Lanka <br />  too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a temple by the name <br />  Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory. </p>
<p>  Rajendra Chila ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi daughter of <br />  the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name Vananvanmadevi <br />  daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur. </p>
<p>  Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as <br />  Gangaikondasolapuram west of present Chidambaram and there he built <br />  his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" commemorating <br />  his victory over Kerala kings. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} </p>
<p>  With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest son the <br />  Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-regent of <br />  Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. When he <br />  ascended the throne among the countries that were still under the <br />  Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country. </p>
<p>  During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty at <br />  Mahodai and of Venadu were agitating to get their freedom. <br />  Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which first <br />  proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera Keralan <br />  in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant Atthivaranam. </p>
<p>  He appointed Rajasimhan{1028-1043} the son of Vira Kerala as the <br />  Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who continued <br />  to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had friendly <br />  relations with them for some time. </p>
<p>  This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami Temple at <br />  Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli pandiya was built by the Chera king <br />  Rajasimha, but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. Rajendra <br />  Chola too has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042 </p>
<p>  Further in the 14th year of the Sunder Chola Pandiya devar at Mannar <br />  Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of the Chera <br />  king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra Chola <br />  Vinnagar Alvar. </p>
<p>  Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started agitating <br />  for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda Muvar of the <br />  region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an expedition to <br />  Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from his kingdom to <br />  the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and Rajadhiraja's forces <br />  further destroyed the military acadamy and arms centre that became <br />  active again at Kanthalur Sala,i and attacked and defeated Vilignam <br />  which revived its efforts under Aye kings to become independent, and <br />  was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam. </p>
<p>  However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule accepting the <br />  suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. Rajasimha was <br />  followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082} on the Chera throne. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajendra Chola ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063} </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle field at <br />  Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2{A.D.1051-<br />  1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from A.D.1051, <br />  crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and continued <br />  with the war with success to Cholas. </p>
<p>  During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola Keralan <br />  in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the same title <br />  as Chola Keralan. </p>
<p>  Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1063-1070} </p>
<p>  With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063-1070} was <br />  crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending the <br />  Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram started <br />  agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. Virarajendra first <br />  sent an expedition to Venad and killed the younger brother of the <br />  Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king himself escaped from his <br />  country. </p>
<p>  Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara Ravi ? 2, <br />  it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war expedition <br />  to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai and <br />  Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. The <br />  Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He defeating <br />  the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants and <br />  maids. </p>
<p>  Period of Adhirajendra Chola {A.D1070-1073} </p>
<p>  With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{A.D1070-1074} <br />  succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-regent <br />  from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period of few <br />  months due to illness. </p>
<p>  During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari <br />  Athirajathirajadever who also bore the title "Virakeralan" ruling <br />  from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at <br />  Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps. </p>
<p>  Period of Kulothtunga Chola {A.D1070-1120} </p>
<p>  After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in the Chola <br />  country with no direct male decendents in the line of the Rajaraja <br />  Chola ? 1 to succeed. </p>
<p>  Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely <br />  Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful heir to the <br />  chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja in the <br />  year A.D.1074. </p>
<p>  Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the Chera <br />  kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain freedom from <br />  from the Chola kings. </p>
<p>  Kulothtunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. He <br />  captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of Kumari <br />  all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a subordinate king <br />  and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he stationd a <br />  nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under the <br />  general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan. </p>
<p>  Kulothtunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in <br />  Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar forces <br />  (suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his death in <br />  this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma {A.D.1082-<br />  1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to Cholas. </p>
<p>  He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at <br />  Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 Rama Varma <br />  Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the Cholas and <br />  regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 <br />  didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost territories of the <br />  Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 years of <br />  intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras. </p>
<p>  The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more Chola-Chera <br />  conflicts after Kulothtunga ? 1 during the period of the remaing <br />  Cholas upto A.D.1250 </p>

        <p>Our dear member Virarajendra @ ratnasabapthy mailed these details<br />as early in 2004 :: </p>
<p>re Adhi Sankara ::</p>
<p>It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and partly<br />during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great Saiva<br />Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who founded<br />the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala.</p>

<blockquote><p>  A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY ON MEDIEVAL CHOLAS <br />  AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE CHERAS {KERALAS} OF THE CONTEMPORARY <br />  PERIOD {A.D.801 - A.D 1120} </p>
<p>  Introduction </p>
<p>  During the periods of the nineth and the tenth centuries, the Chera <br />  country was ruled by three principal royal dynasties known as the <br />  Ayes, Venads and Kulasekaras from three distinctive regions of Kerala <br />  (the Sanskritised version of Chera), and the kings of these three <br />  dynasties and the other Chieftains ruling small regions of rest of <br />  the Kerala, all were generally referred to as the Cheras or Keralas <br />  by the people of Chola &amp; Pandiya countries of this period. </p>
<p>  The Aye dynasty were ruling a region covering from the present <br />  Nagerkoil of Tamil Nadu the southern end of the Aye kingdom, upwards <br />  into Kerala to the present Anjuthengu in the north of the present <br />  Thiruvananthapuram, and was known as Aye Nadu. Their capital was at <br />  Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye Nadu <br />  also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic studies <br />  acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was located deep <br />  south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to Nagerkoil the <br />  southern end of the Aye kingdom. </p>
<p>  The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu covering a <br />  region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as Kollam <br />  Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport city on <br />  the west Kerala. </p>
<p>  The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond Kottayam <br />  further north upto and around the present region of Kolikkodu <br />  (Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital at <br />  Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as Makothai, and <br />  a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu country of <br />  that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil Nadu, <br />  bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under their <br />  rule during this period. </p>
<p>  Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory ruled by <br />  Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" under <br />  different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who accepted <br />  the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their respective <br />  regions as subordinates to them. </p>
<p>  The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya Chola </p>
<p>  Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a powerful <br />  Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in <br />  Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country covering the length of the Kolli -<br />  Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his capital <br />  at Mahodayapuram. </p>
<p>  He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />  nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur (the <br />  Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the Pandiya <br />  country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably during <br />  this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the Kulasekara <br />  dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to rule over <br />  this region. </p>
<p>  Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as an <br />  incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of this period <br />  referred to him as Kulasekara Perumal in reverence. </p>
<p>  He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in Cholanadu, and <br />  Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, and has <br />  composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu named <br />  as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda Mala". He <br />  abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was venerated as <br />  one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the <br />  Kulasekara Alvar. </p>
<p>  The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. With <br />  the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son Rajasekaran<br />  {A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was also known <br />  by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an ardent <br />  devotee of God Siva. </p>
<p>  Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram spent <br />  most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at the <br />  Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) in the <br />  Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great Tamil Saiva <br />  Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a pilgrimage to <br />  the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera king <br />  Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva Saint, <br />  also went to Thiruvarur at this same time. </p>
<p>  Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera king <br />  composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as "Mummanikkovai". From <br />  there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar to the <br />  Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other Siva <br />  Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further hyms in <br />  Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponnvanna Anthathi" <br />  and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and venerated <br />  as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by him have <br />  been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a <br />  collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by various <br />  Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala State). </p>
<p>  Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar the <br />  Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the palace of <br />  this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the Chera <br />  country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam <br />  (Udagai) region of TamilNadu. </p>
<p>  While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar died. <br />  Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the <br />  Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in the <br />  same year. </p>
<p>  It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and partly <br />  during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great Saiva <br />  Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who founded <br />  the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala. </p>
<p>  It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal from <br />  Venad in the Chera country though not classified under the sixty-<br />  three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by him <br />  named `Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola country, <br />  has been included in the nineth Thirumurai. It appears the Venattu <br />  Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the <br />  Sundaramurthi Nayanar. </p>
<p>  The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was followed <br />  by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma Kulasekaran (alias <br />  Ko-Kandan) (A.D.844 - 885) on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram. <br />  Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had a daughter by <br />  the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva from another <br />  Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala. </p>
<p>  It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, the Chola <br />  dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in partial or <br />  total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for nearly six <br />  centuries. </p>
<p>  Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881} </p>
<p>  The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into prominance <br />  was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}, who ruled the Chola <br />  country from Thanjavur. </p>
<p>  It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very friendly <br />  relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his daughter <br />  both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good relations <br />  that existed with the Chola country, had made their endowments to the <br />  Siva temples in the Chola country </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu Ravi <br />  also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravarti Kulasekaradeva, the <br />  villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named Satanur in <br />  the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as Tiruayanisuramudaiya <br />  Nayanar. </p>
<p>  The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the temple of <br />  Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) in the <br />  year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu Ravi also <br />  gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in <br />  Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870. </p>
<p>  Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his son <br />  Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, who was <br />  a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of his rule <br />  the Athitha Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the Chera king <br />  Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king. </p>
<p>  A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was greatly <br />  instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was rewarded <br />  jointly by the Chola &amp; Chera kings with a crown, palace, elephants, <br />  royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan Thamil Verl". </p>
<p>  Towards the middle of Athitha Chola's rule the Chera king Sthani Ravi <br />  died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara{A.D.885-917} on the <br />  Chera throne. </p>
<p>  During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan (A.D.860-<br />  905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to them was <br />  born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920). </p>
<p>  Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907-953} </p>
<p>  Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-953) <br />  on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan Adigal <br />  daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. He also <br />  married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar Kandan <br />  Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the present <br />  Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a further <br />  queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of the Venad <br />  King of the Chera country, who refer themselves as "Villavar'. </p>
<p>  Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named <br />  Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a younger son <br />  by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan. </p>
<p>  A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named Velankumaran <br />  was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the Prince <br />  Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu. </p>
<p>  Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the Pandiyanadu waged <br />  war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera king Rama <br />  Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha. </p>
<p>  Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the <br />  assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with Paranthaha and <br />  his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma at <br />  Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in Sri <br />  Lanka. </p>
<p>  As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri Lankan <br />  king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, returned to the <br />  Chera Country of his mother. </p>
<p>  The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the foremost among <br />  the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara dynasty, <br />  paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween these two <br />  countries to increase many folds. During this period there seems to <br />  have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola <br />  country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king. </p>
<p>  The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the queen of <br />  Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for lighting <br />  lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year A.D.923. </p>
<p>  In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-arisilar Kumaran a native of the <br />  Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala country <br />  gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in <br />  Kudumiyam\nmalai in Cholanadu </p>
<p>  In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of Malainadu <br />  gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in Cholanadu. </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold for <br />  lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in Thanjavur. </p>
<p>  She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named <br />  Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During her time <br />  a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present Pondicherry) <br />  and named after her as Kokkilanadi-pereri in Chola country. </p>
<p>  There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala Kurumban <br />  given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha Chola with the <br />  title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts to the the <br />  temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927. </p>
<p>  In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king <br />  Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier Chera king <br />  Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for lighting <br />  lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in Thondainadu <br />  which was under Chola rule. </p>
<p>  Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu <br />  (Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated a lamp <br />  to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam. </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince <br />  Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone temple to <br />  Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in Thondaimandalam. </p>
<p>  Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at Thirumalpuram in <br />  Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of Kodungolur <br />  (Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948. </p>
<p>  Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the <br />  presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur A.D.952 </p>
<p>  Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama Varma, the <br />  king Kothai Ravi Varma{A.D.917-947} succeeded on the Chera throne at <br />  Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country. </p>
<p>  After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by <br />  Indukotha Varma{A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram. </p>
<p>  Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957} </p>
<p>  After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola (A.D..950-<br />  957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with <br />  Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king his <br />  thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious life, <br />  and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil known <br />  as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the nineth <br />  Thirumurai.) </p>
<p>  Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957} </p>
<p>  He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded to the <br />  Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king the <br />  Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar. </p>
<p>  Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970} </p>
<p>  With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the Sundera Chola <br />  ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the Malaiyaman <br />  king of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar <br />  Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias Thiribhuvanamatheviyar and <br />  also Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and to the <br />  former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1. </p>
<p>  During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was succeeded by <br />  Bhaskara Ravi Varma -1{A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. Baskara Ravi <br />  Varma - 2{A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted Bhakara Ravi Varma ? <br />  1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which stretched from the present <br />  Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region encompassing the Kudamalainadu, <br />  Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-regent probably from Uthahai in the <br />  Kongu region which was under the Chera rule during this period. </p>
<p>  Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985} </p>
<p>  After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 was the <br />  legitimate heir to the Chola throne, but he whole heartedly gave way <br />  to Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola being <br />  his paternal uncle to rule for some period. </p>
<p>  Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named Panchavanmatheviyar who <br />  was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar known as Kandan <br />  Sundera Cholan. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014} </p>
<p>  Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by the heir <br />  apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D.985-1014} on the Chola throne. </p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman king of <br />  Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was also as <br />  Thiribhuvanamadevi. </p>
<p>  One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi the daughter of the king <br />  of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a queen known as <br />  Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of Paluvettaraiyar Kandan <br />  Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west of Thirutchirappalli <br />  bordering Kerala state. It was to this Vanavanmadevi the greatest <br />  emperor in the Chola history namely the Rajendra Chola ? 1 was born. </p>
<p>  With the accession of Rajaraja Chola-1 on the Chola throne and with <br />  his imperialistic ambitions over South India, found that it was <br />  necessary initially to overcome the powerfull Cheras. </p>
<p>  During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the Aye <br />  dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a <br />  military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur Salai <br />  which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced great <br />  trained warriors. </p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines of <br />  these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera(Kerala) <br />  country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an <br />  absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern region of <br />  the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull kings. </p>
<p>  Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in <br />  A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military <br />  acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again <br />  in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military <br />  acadamy and arsenal centre. </p>
<p>  This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the <br />  year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military <br />  acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of <br />  Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of Vilignam. </p>
<p>  The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The Rajaraja <br />  Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village called <br />  Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of <br />  Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu). </p>
<p>  Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants in the <br />  year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi (October/November) <br />  a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya <br />  nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the God at <br />  the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river and a <br />  perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day. </p>
<p>  He now turned his attention on his conquest of the territories in the <br />  Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the present <br />  Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja-1 thereafter sent an ambassador to the <br />  co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of Mahodai ruling from <br />  Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as Udagai), namely Baskara <br />  Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the family of Kulasekaras, <br />  requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty and to pay tributes. </p>
<p>  The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of Uthahai <br />  and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja Chola-1 who <br />  sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year A.D.1014 <br />  which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears Baskara <br />  Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu was controlled by Cholas. </p>
<p>  The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the north and <br />  central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara Ravivarman <br />  Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the <br />  Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram <br />  (Kodungolur). It appears Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 too accepted the <br />  Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in the <br />  Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the territories of <br />  Chera country ruled by the other chieftans which were under Baskara <br />  Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy. </p>
<p>  The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory (Kolladesam) <br />  and captured the the region along with its seaport capital the Kollam<br />  (proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain Govardhana <br />  Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the <br />  Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044} </p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was succeeeded by <br />  his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a co-<br />  regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012. </p>
<p>  During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year A.D.1019, with <br />  the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 of <br />  Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his second <br />  son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who defeated <br />  the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital Mahothai <br />  and secured his crown, diadem and an island called Santhimathivu <br />  belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic sea. In this war <br />  Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death. </p>
<p>  With the his securing of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? 1 <br />  assumed the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 gave the <br />  title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and appointed <br />  him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu of the <br />  Kerala country. </p>
<p>  However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war expedition <br />  with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera country <br />  in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera Keralan<br />  {A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule on accepting the <br />  Chola suzerainty. </p>
<p>  Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and his <br />  father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at Jayamaliswarem <br />  in A.D.1023 and built a Salai for providing food named as Chola-<br />  Keralan Chalai and for revenue for its expenses gifted a village <br />  named Chola-Kerala Nallur. </p>
<p>  Rajendra Chola ? 1 in memory of his mother after her death made a <br />  statue of herself and installed at the temple known as Sembianmathevi <br />  at Nagapattinam and made arrangements for its worship. In Sri Lanka <br />  too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a temple by the name <br />  Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory. </p>
<p>  Rajendra Chila ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi daughter of <br />  the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name Vananvanmadevi <br />  daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur. </p>
<p>  Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as <br />  Gangaikondasolapuram west of present Chidambaram and there he built <br />  his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" commemorating <br />  his victory over Kerala kings. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} </p>
<p>  With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest son the <br />  Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-regent of <br />  Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. When he <br />  ascended the throne among the countries that were still under the <br />  Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country. </p>
<p>  During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty at <br />  Mahodai and of Venadu were agitating to get their freedom. <br />  Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which first <br />  proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera Keralan <br />  in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant Atthivaranam. </p>
<p>  He appointed Rajasimhan{1028-1043} the son of Vira Kerala as the <br />  Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who continued <br />  to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had friendly <br />  relations with them for some time. </p>
<p>  This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami Temple at <br />  Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli pandiya was built by the Chera king <br />  Rajasimha, but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. Rajendra <br />  Chola too has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042 </p>
<p>  Further in the 14th year of the Sunder Chola Pandiya devar at Mannar <br />  Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of the Chera <br />  king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra Chola <br />  Vinnagar Alvar. </p>
<p>  Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started agitating <br />  for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda Muvar of the <br />  region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an expedition to <br />  Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from his kingdom to <br />  the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and Rajadhiraja's forces <br />  further destroyed the military acadamy and arms centre that became <br />  active again at Kanthalur Sala,i and attacked and defeated Vilignam <br />  which revived its efforts under Aye kings to become independent, and <br />  was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam. </p>
<p>  However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule accepting the <br />  suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. Rajasimha was <br />  followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082} on the Chera throne. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajendra Chola ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063} </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle field at <br />  Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2{A.D.1051-<br />  1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from A.D.1051, <br />  crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and continued <br />  with the war with success to Cholas. </p>
<p>  During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola Keralan <br />  in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the same title <br />  as Chola Keralan. </p>
<p>  Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1063-1070} </p>
<p>  With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063-1070} was <br />  crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending the <br />  Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram started <br />  agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. Virarajendra first <br />  sent an expedition to Venad and killed the younger brother of the <br />  Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king himself escaped from his <br />  country. </p>
<p>  Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara Ravi ? 2, <br />  it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war expedition <br />  to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai and <br />  Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. The <br />  Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He defeating <br />  the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants and <br />  maids. </p>
<p>  Period of Adhirajendra Chola {A.D1070-1073} </p>
<p>  With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{A.D1070-1074} <br />  succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-regent <br />  from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period of few <br />  months due to illness. </p>
<p>  During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari <br />  Athirajathirajadever who also bore the title "Virakeralan" ruling <br />  from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at <br />  Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps. </p>
<p>  Period of Kulothtunga Chola {A.D1070-1120} </p>
<p>  After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in the Chola <br />  country with no direct male decendents in the line of the Rajaraja <br />  Chola ? 1 to succeed. </p>
<p>  Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely <br />  Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful heir to the <br />  chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja in the <br />  year A.D.1074. </p>
<p>  Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the Chera <br />  kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain freedom from <br />  from the Chola kings. </p>
<p>  Kulothtunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. He <br />  captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of Kumari <br />  all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a subordinate king <br />  and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he stationd a <br />  nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under the <br />  general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan. </p>
<p>  Kulothtunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in <br />  Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar forces <br />  (suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his death in <br />  this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma {A.D.1082-<br />  1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to Cholas. </p>
<p>  He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at <br />  Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 Rama Varma <br />  Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the Cholas and <br />  regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 <br />  didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost territories of the <br />  Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 years of <br />  intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras. </p>
<p>  The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more Chola-Chera <br />  conflicts after Kulothtunga ? 1 during the period of the remaing <br />  Cholas upto A.D.1250 </p>
