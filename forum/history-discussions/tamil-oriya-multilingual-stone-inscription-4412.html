<p>Tamil-Oriya Multilingual Inscriptions which speaks tamil saivamadam <br />settlement in bhubaneswar. This is a rare stone inscription on debtor <br />and creditor.</p>
<p>The two inscription are engraved on a stone slab measuring about 26 <br />?" in height, 23" in breadth and 5 3/4" in thickness. About the <br />middle of the top part, there is an image of Ganesa measuring 8 ?" in <br />length, 6" in breadth and 1 1/4" in depth, engraved in bas-relief. <br />The space in the right side of the surface is covered by an Oriya <br />inscription in 34lines. The space in the left half of the stone is <br />occupied by an inscription in the Tamil language inscribed in Tamil <br />and grantha characters. The writing is in a fairly good state of <br />preservation.<br />Both the Oriya and Tamil sections of the inscription <br />refer to a transaction between a debtor and a creditor, the former <br />being a pontiff of a Matha of Tamilian Saivas at Bhubaneswar and the <br />letter a local Oriya moneyed man. That is why the document is written <br />in two different versions, Oriya and Tamil.</p>

Kshetra) after having mortgaged <br />land to Durggabhattar - the land consisting of 12 Vattis at <br />Vaghamara, given for feeding the Mahesvaras in this monastery for the <br />propitiation of the eleven Rudras by the Elder Narasimhadeva and <br />taken a loan of 118 Madha - is obtained Sivaloka (i.e. died) without <br />repaying these 148 Madhais.<br />Lines 19-29 This Mada (Matha) having then come under the control <br />of Tapachchakravarttigal and he and Durgga-bhattar being friends <br />owing to their birth under the same rasi, this latter gave back 148 <br />madais in the hands of this (former) with the libation of water (i.e. <br />relieved the former from the debt; and himself paid off 10 madhais <br />and 30 pottis of paddy that had been (additionally) borrowed from his <br />(i.e. Durggabhatttar's father in law or maternal uncle) Uttaresvara <br />Nayaka and gave the land in his (i.e. Tapachchakravarttigal's) hands <br />with libation of water.<br />Lines 30-32 Let the ascetics who have become well disciplined in <br />the convention (of the Mahesvaras) in various Madas and have been <br />born in the three Mandates be trained (here) for the long life, <br />health and prosperity of this Vira Narasjmhadeva. Let the Sun, the <br />Moon, the Wind etc bear witness to this (transaction).</p>
<p>Historical Note<br />Both the inscriptions speak of two Narasimhas, of whom one has got <br />the distinguishing epithet "Bada"in Oriya and "Pousti" in Tamil; both <br />meaning big or elder and the other was Sri Vira Narasimhadeva during <br />whose reign the inscriptions under study were incised. Dr. Sircar <br />identifies the reigning monarch with Narasirnha IV and calculates the <br />date as 24th September, 1396 A D. But this identification is wrong as <br />the details of the date given in the records, 22 Srahi Kfirttfta <br />Krsna RavivSra, fully tally witti 2nd October.1295 A.D. when the 22nd <br />Anka year was current. In that case Bada Narasimhadeva was his grand <br />father, the most powerful Narasimha I (1238-1264 A.D.) who is known <br />from his Lingaraja temple Inscriptions as a great patron of Saiva <br />ascetics. The significance of the expression Ekadasa-Rudra-bhiksba is <br />clear from the Tamil version, which states that the grant was made <br />for the feeding of the Saiva ascetics for gaining the favour of <br />elevan Rudras.<br />The name of Nara Narasimha is found in an inscription of Saka 1203 in <br />the Lakshmi-Narasimha temple at Simhachalam, in an inscription of <br />1205 Saka in the DurgS Devi temple at Bhogapuram in two inscriptions <br />of Saka 1215 m the Kurmesvara temple at Srikurmam, in the <br />Ghandrasekhara temple in the Prataparudrapura Sasana in the Puri <br />district. It was also issued in his 22nd Srahi like the two records <br />under discussion in the village of Vaghamari (identified with the <br />present Bhagamari village under Begunia P.S., Dist. - Puri) in favour <br />of Siddhesvara matha at Sri Kirtivasa ksetra {Bhubaneswar) by <br />Narasimha I.<br />father in-law (or maternal uncle) of Durgabhatta Acharya. It is also <br />clear from its final portion that the land being free from debt was <br />re dedicated for the purpose of the training and maintenance of <br />ascetics who hailed from the three mandates of Choda, Pandya and <br />Kanchi desa having being initiated in the conventional code of <br />conduct in the various Mathas of these three regions in the <br />Siddhesvara Matha at Bhubaneswar for the long life, health and <br />prosperity of Vira Narasimhadeva. The use of the word Sampradaya, no <br />doubt refers to the conventions of a particular Saiva school, that <br />flourished in the Tamil country.<br />There is one discrepancy in the two records. The amount borrowed by <br />Taporaja mahamuni is stated to be 148 madhas in the Tamil Version, <br />whereas it is stated as 150 in its Oriya counterpart. The reason of <br />this discrepancy seems to be that 2 out of 150 madhas were paid to <br />the writer and the engraver of this document.</p>
<p>Oriya version of the multilingual Inscription</p>
<p>Translation<br />Lines 1-4 May there be success ! In the increasingly victori?<br />ous reign of the illustrious Vira Naranarasimhadeva year 22 Karttika <br />Krishna 7 Sunday.<br />Lines 4-18 Formerly an area of 12 Vatis of land at Vagha-mara <br />was granted as Ekadasa Rudrabhiksha in favour of Siddhesvara Matha at <br />the illustrious Krittivas Kshetra (i.e. Bhubaneswar) for the <br />longevity and fulfillment of the desires of the elder Narasimhadeva. <br />This land was mortgaged by Taporaja Mahamuni to Durgabhatta Acharya, <br />The amount borrowed was one hundred and fifty gold Madbas. He also <br />borrowed from Uttaresvara Nayaka in this case ten gold Mad has and <br />thirty Pautis of paddy. Having deposited these two items viz yaddy <br />and gold that had bean borrowed by Taporaja Mahamuni, to Uttaresvara <br />Nayaka, Durgabhatta Acharya calculated the sum payable to him by <br />Taporaja Mahamuni. On the paddy and gold being considered together <br />and the capital and interest being calculated the whole amount was <br />found to be one hundred and eighty gold Mad has.<br />Lines 18-26 When Taporaja Mahamuni obtained Siva (i.e. died) <br />Tapasehakravarti became the sthana-pati (i e. head of the matha). The <br />Tapaschakravarti's rasi (i.e. the constellation under which be was <br />born) was the same as that of Durgabhatta Acharya. Having learnt <br />this, Durgabhatta Acharya became a friendly party to Tapaschakravarti <br />because both of them belonged to the same rasi. Durgabhatta Acharya <br />poured water in the hands of (i.e. made a ceremonial offering in <br />favour of) Tapaschakravarti in respect of written document involving <br />one hundred and eighty gold coins and entitling him to enjoy the said <br />twelve vatis of land at Vaghamara.<br />Lines 26-34 He declared that the said land be made Ekadasa Rudra <br />bhiksha for the longevity and fulfillment of desires of the <br />illustrious Vira Naranarasimbadeva. This Bhiksha is meant for the <br />ascetics who are born in the three countries viz. Choda desa, Pandya <br />desa and Kanchi desa and who have obtained initiation in the various <br />Math as of those countries and become strict followers of the acharas <br />(pres?cribed for the Mahesvaras). This Bhiksha is to for so long a <br />time as the Sun and Moon exist.</p>
<p>How the tamil oriya multilingual inscription discovered</p>
<p>While excavating a site for the foundation of a monastery near Gauri-<br />Kedara area of Bhubaneswar by his holiness Swami Kesavananda <br />Brahmachari in 1916, a stone tablet containing two inscription was <br />discovered. This was made over to Mr. Ganapati Siroar of the <br />Calcultta University who published an article with a good <br />illustration in the journal and proceedings of the Asiatic Society of <br />Bengal. Vol XX, 1924, PP 41ff. Recently the stone was secured for the <br />Ashutosh Museum of Indian Arts attached to the University of Calcutta.</p></acronym></p>

<p>S.BalasubramaniB+<br />Bhubaneswar Orissa</p>
<p>Tamil-Oriya Multilingual Inscriptions which speaks tamil saivamadam <br />settlement in bhubaneswar. This is a rare stone inscription on debtor <br />and creditor.</p>
<p>The two inscription are engraved on a stone slab measuring about 26 <br />?" in height, 23" in breadth and 5 3/4" in thickness. About the <br />middle of the top part, there is an image of Ganesa measuring 8 ?" in <br />length, 6" in breadth and 1 1/4" in depth, engraved in bas-relief. <br />The space in the right side of the surface is covered by an Oriya <br />inscription in 34lines. The space in the left half of the stone is <br />occupied by an inscription in the Tamil language inscribed in Tamil <br />and grantha characters. The writing is in a fairly good state of <br />preservation.<br />Both the Oriya and Tamil sections of the inscription <br />refer to a transaction between a debtor and a creditor, the former <br />being a pontiff of a Matha of Tamilian Saivas at Bhubaneswar and the <br />letter a local Oriya moneyed man. That is why the document is written <br />in two different versions, Oriya and Tamil.</p>

Kshetra) after having mortgaged <br />land to Durggabhattar - the land consisting of 12 Vattis at <br />Vaghamara, given for feeding the Mahesvaras in this monastery for the <br />propitiation of the eleven Rudras by the Elder Narasimhadeva and <br />taken a loan of 118 Madha - is obtained Sivaloka (i.e. died) without <br />repaying these 148 Madhais.<br />Lines 19-29 This Mada (Matha) having then come under the control <br />of Tapachchakravarttig al and he and Durgga-bhattar being friends <br />owing to their birth under the same rasi, this latter gave back 148 <br />madais in the hands of this (former) with the libation of water (i.e. <br />relieved the former from the debt; and himself paid off 10 madhais <br />and 30 pottis of paddy that had been (additionally) borrowed from his <br />(i.e. Durggabhatttar' s father in law or maternal uncle) Uttaresvara <br />Nayaka and gave the land in his (i.e. Tapachchakravarttig al's) hands <br />with libation of water.<br />Lines 30-32 Let the ascetics who have become well disciplined in <br />the convention (of the Mahesvaras) in various Madas and have been <br />born in the three Mandates be trained (here) for the long life, <br />health and prosperity of this Vira Narasjmhadeva. Let the Sun, the <br />Moon, the Wind etc bear witness to this (transaction) .</p>
<p>Historical Note<br />Both the inscriptions speak of two Narasimhas, of whom one has got <br />the distinguishing epithet "Bada"in Oriya and "Pousti" in Tamil; both <br />meaning big or elder and the other was Sri Vira Narasimhadeva during <br />whose reign the inscriptions under study were incised. Dr. Sircar <br />identifies the reigning monarch with Narasirnha IV and calculates the <br />date as 24th September, 1396 A D. But this identification is wrong as <br />the details of the date given in the records, 22 Srahi Kfirttfta <br />Krsna RavivSra, fully tally witti 2nd October.1295 A.D. when the 22nd <br />Anka year was current. In that case Bada Narasimhadeva was his grand <br />father, the most powerful Narasimha I (1238-1264 A.D.) who is known <br />from his Lingaraja temple Inscriptions as a great patron of Saiva <br />ascetics. The significance of the expression Ekadasa-Rudra- bhiksba is <br />clear from the Tamil version, which states that the grant was made <br />for the feeding of the Saiva ascetics for gaining the favour of <br />elevan Rudras.<br />The name of Nara Narasimha is found in an inscription of Saka 1203 in <br />the Lakshmi-Narasimha temple at Simhachalam, in an inscription of <br />1205 Saka in the DurgS Devi temple at Bhogapuram in two inscriptions <br />of Saka 1215 m the Kurmesvara temple at Srikurmam, in the <br />Ghandrasekhara temple in the Prataparudrapura Sasana in the Puri <br />district. It was also issued in his 22nd Srahi like the two records <br />under discussion in the village of Vaghamari (identified with the <br />present Bhagamari village under Begunia P.S., Dist. - Puri) in favour <br />of Siddhesvara matha at Sri Kirtivasa ksetra {Bhubaneswar) by <br />Narasimha I.<br />father in-law (or maternal uncle) of Durgabhatta Acharya. It is also <br />clear from its final portion that the land being free from debt was <br />re dedicated for the purpose of the training and maintenance of <br />ascetics who hailed from the three mandates of Choda, Pandya and <br />Kanchi desa having being initiated in the conventional code of <br />conduct in the various Mathas of these three regions in the <br />Siddhesvara Matha at Bhubaneswar for the long life, health and <br />prosperity of Vira Narasimhadeva. The use of the word Sampradaya, no <br />doubt refers to the conventions of a particular Saiva school, that <br />flourished in the Tamil country.<br />There is one discrepancy in the two records. The amount borrowed by <br />Taporaja mahamuni is stated to be 148 madhas in the Tamil Version, <br />whereas it is stated as 150 in its Oriya counterpart. The reason of <br />this discrepancy seems to be that 2 out of 150 madhas were paid to <br />the writer and the engraver of this document.</p>
<p>Oriya version of the multilingual Inscription</p>
<p>Translation<br />Lines 1-4 May there be success ! In the increasingly victori?<br />ous reign of the illustrious Vira Naranarasimhadeva year 22 Karttika <br />Krishna 7 Sunday.<br />Lines 4-18 Formerly an area of 12 Vatis of land at Vagha-mara <br />was granted as Ekadasa Rudrabhiksha in favour of Siddhesvara Matha at <br />the illustrious Krittivas Kshetra (i.e. Bhubaneswar) for the <br />longevity and fulfillment of the desires of the elder Narasimhadeva. <br />This land was mortgaged by Taporaja Mahamuni to Durgabhatta Acharya, <br />The amount borrowed was one hundred and fifty gold Madbas. He also <br />borrowed from Uttaresvara Nayaka in this case ten gold Mad has and <br />thirty Pautis of paddy. Having deposited these two items viz yaddy <br />and gold that had bean borrowed by Taporaja Mahamuni, to Uttaresvara <br />Nayaka, Durgabhatta Acharya calculated the sum payable to him by <br />Taporaja Mahamuni. On the paddy and gold being considered together <br />and the capital and interest being calculated the whole amount was <br />found to be one hundred and eighty gold Mad has.<br />Lines 18-26 When Taporaja Mahamuni obtained Siva (i.e. died) <br />Tapasehakravarti became the sthana-pati (i e. head of the matha). The <br />Tapaschakravarti' s rasi (i.e. the constellation under which be was <br />born) was the same as that of Durgabhatta Acharya. Having learnt <br />this, Durgabhatta Acharya became a friendly party to Tapaschakravarti <br />because both of them belonged to the same rasi. Durgabhatta Acharya <br />poured water in the hands of (i.e. made a ceremonial offering in <br />favour of) Tapaschakravarti in respect of written document involving <br />one hundred and eighty gold coins and entitling him to enjoy the said <br />twelve vatis of land at Vaghamara.<br />Lines 26-34 He declared that the said land be made Ekadasa Rudra <br />bhiksha for the longevity and fulfillment of desires of the <br />illustrious Vira Naranarasimbadeva. This Bhiksha is meant for the <br />ascetics who are born in the three countries viz. Choda desa, Pandya <br />desa and Kanchi desa and who have obtained initiation in the various <br />Math as of those countries and become strict followers of the acharas <br />(pres?cribed for the Mahesvaras). This Bhiksha is to for so long a <br />time as the Sun and Moon exist.</p>
<p>How the tamil oriya multilingual inscription discovered</p>
<p>While excavating a site for the foundation of a monastery near Gauri-<br />Kedara area of Bhubaneswar by his holiness Swami Kesavananda <br />Brahmachari in 1916, a stone tablet containing two inscription was <br />discovered. This was made over to Mr. Ganapati Siroar of the <br />Calcultta University who published an article with a good <br />illustration in the journal and proceedings of the Asiatic Society of <br />Bengal. Vol XX, 1924, PP 41ff. Recently the stone was secured for the <br />Ashutosh Museum of Indian Arts attached to the University of Calcutta.</p>

<p>  Historical Note<br />  Both the inscriptions speak of two Narasimhas, of whom one has got<br />  the distinguishing epithet "Bada"in Oriya and "Pousti" in Tamil; both<br />  meaning big or elder and the other was Sri Vira Narasimhadeva during<br />  whose reign the inscriptions under study were incised. Dr. Sircar<br />  identifies the reigning monarch with Narasirnha IV and calculates the<br />  date as 24th September, 1396 A D. But this identification is wrong as<br />  the details of the date given in the records, 22 Srahi Kfirttfta<br />  Krsna RavivSra, fully tally witti 2nd October.1295 A.D. when the 22nd<br />  Anka year was current. In that case Bada Narasimhadeva was his grand<br />  father, the most powerful Narasimha I (1238-1264 A.D.) who is known<br />  from his Lingaraja temple Inscriptions as a great patron of Saiva<br />  ascetics. The significance of the expression Ekadasa-Rudra-bhiksba is<br />  clear from the Tamil version, which states that the grant was made<br />  for the feeding of the Saiva ascetics for gaining the favour of<br />  elevan Rudras.<br />  The name of Nara Narasimha is found in an inscription of Saka 1203 in<br />  the Lakshmi-Narasimha temple at Simhachalam, in an inscription of<br />  1205 Saka in the DurgS Devi temple at Bhogapuram in two inscriptions<br />  of Saka 1215 m the Kurmesvara temple at Srikurmam, in the<br />  Ghandrasekhara temple in the Prataparudrapura Sasana in the Puri<br />  district. It was also issued in his 22nd Srahi like the two records<br />  under discussion in the village of Vaghamari (identified with the<br />  present Bhagamari village under Begunia P.S., Dist. - Puri) in favour<br />  of Siddhesvara matha at Sri Kirtivasa ksetra {Bhubaneswar) by<br />  Narasimha I.<br />  father in-law (or maternal uncle) of Durgabhatta Acharya. It is also<br />  clear from its final portion that the land being free from debt was<br />  re dedicated for the purpose of the training and maintenance of<br />  ascetics who hailed from the three mandates of Choda, Pandya and<br />  Kanchi desa having being initiated in the conventional code of<br />  conduct in the various Mathas of these three regions in the<br />  Siddhesvara Matha at Bhubaneswar for the long life, health and<br />  prosperity of Vira Narasimhadeva. The use of the word Sampradaya, no<br />  doubt refers to the conventions of a particular Saiva school, that<br />  flourished in the Tamil country.<br />  There is one discrepancy in the two records. The amount borrowed by<br />  Taporaja mahamuni is stated to be 148 madhas in the Tamil Version,<br />  whereas it is stated as 150 in its Oriya counterpart. The reason of<br />  this discrepancy seems to be that 2 out of 150 madhas were paid to<br />  the writer and the engraver of this document.</p>
<p>  Oriya version of the multilingual Inscription</p>
<p>  Translation<br />  Lines 1-4 May there be success ! In the increasingly victori&shy;   ous reign of the illustrious Vira Naranarasimhadeva year 22 Karttika<br />  Krishna 7 Sunday.<br />  Lines 4-18 Formerly an area of 12 Vatis of land at Vagha-mara<br />  was granted as Ekadasa Rudrabhiksha in favour of Siddhesvara Matha at<br />  the illustrious Krittivas Kshetra (i.e. Bhubaneswar) for the<br />  longevity and fulfillment of the desires of the elder Narasimhadeva.<br />  This land was mortgaged by Taporaja Mahamuni to Durgabhatta Acharya,<br />  The amount borrowed was one hundred and fifty gold Madbas. He also<br />  borrowed from Uttaresvara Nayaka in this case ten gold Mad has and<br />  thirty Pautis of paddy. Having deposited these two items viz yaddy<br />  and gold that had bean borrowed by Taporaja Mahamuni, to Uttaresvara<br />  Nayaka, Durgabhatta Acharya calculated the sum payable to him by<br />  Taporaja Mahamuni. On the paddy and gold being considered together<br />  and the capital and interest being calculated the whole amount was<br />  found to be one hundred and eighty gold Mad has.<br />  Lines 18-26 When Taporaja Mahamuni obtained Siva (i.e. died)<br />  Tapasehakravarti became the sthana-pati (i e. head of the matha). The<br />  Tapaschakravarti's rasi (i.e. the constellation under which be was<br />  born) was the same as that of Durgabhatta Acharya. Having learnt<br />  this, Durgabhatta Acharya became a friendly party to Tapaschakravarti<br />  because both of them belonged to the same rasi. Durgabhatta Acharya<br />  poured water in the hands of (i.e. made a ceremonial offering in<br />  favour of) Tapaschakravarti in respect of written document involving<br />  one hundred and eighty gold coins and entitling him to enjoy the said<br />  twelve vatis of land at Vaghamara.<br />  Lines 26-34 He declared that the said land be made Ekadasa Rudra<br />  bhiksha for the longevity and fulfillment of desires of the<br />  illustrious Vira Naranarasimbadeva. This Bhiksha is meant for the<br />  ascetics who are born in the three countries viz. Choda desa, Pandya<br />  desa and Kanchi desa and who have obtained initiation in the various<br />  Math as of those countries and become strict followers of the acharas<br />  (pres&shy;cribed for the Mahesvaras). This Bhiksha is to for so long a<br />  time as the Sun and Moon exist.</p>
<p>  How the tamil oriya multilingual inscription discovered</p>
<p>  While excavating a site for the foundation of a monastery near Gauri-<br />  Kedara area of Bhubaneswar by his holiness Swami Kesavananda<br />  Brahmachari in 1916, a stone tablet containing two inscription was<br />  discovered. This was made over to Mr. Ganapati Siroar of the<br />  Calcultta University who published an article with a good<br />  illustration in the journal and proceedings of the Asiatic Society of<br />  Bengal. Vol XX, 1924, PP 41ff. Recently the stone was secured for the<br />  Ashutosh Museum of Indian Arts attached to the University of Calcutta.</p>

<p>  Tamil-Oriya Multilingual Inscriptions which speaks<br />  tamil saivamadam <br />  settlement in bhubaneswar. This is a rare stone<br />  inscription on debtor <br />  and creditor.</p>
<p>  The two inscription are engraved on a stone slab<br />  measuring about 26 <br />  ?" in height, 23" in breadth and 5 3/4" in<br />  thickness. About the <br />  middle of the top part, there is an image of Ganesa<br />  measuring 8 ?" in <br />  length, 6" in breadth and 1 1/4" in depth, engraved<br />  in bas-relief. <br />  The space in the right side of the surface is<br />  covered by an Oriya <br />  inscription in 34lines. The space in the left half<br />  of the stone is <br />  occupied by an inscription in the Tamil language<br />  inscribed in Tamil <br />  and grantha characters. The writing is in a fairly<br />  good state of <br />  preservation.<br />  Both the Oriya and Tamil sections of the<br />  inscription <br />  refer to a transaction between a debtor and a<br />  creditor, the former <br />  being a pontiff of a Matha of Tamilian Saivas at<br />  Bhubaneswar and the <br />  letter a local Oriya moneyed man. That is why the<br />  document is written <br />  in two different versions, Oriya and Tamil.</p>

<p>  Historical Note<br />  Both the inscriptions speak of two Narasimhas, of<br />  whom one has got <br />  the distinguishing epithet "Bada"in Oriya and<br />  "Pousti" in Tamil; both <br />  meaning big or elder and the other was Sri Vira<br />  Narasimhadeva during <br />  whose reign the inscriptions under study were<br />  incised. Dr. Sircar <br />  identifies the reigning monarch with Narasirnha IV<br />  and calculates the <br />  date as 24th September, 1396 A D. But this<br />  identification is wrong as <br />  the details of the date given in the records, 22<br />  Srahi Kfirttfta <br />  Krsna RavivSra, fully tally witti 2nd October.1295<br />  A.D. when the 22nd <br />  Anka year was current. In that case Bada<br />  Narasimhadeva was his grand <br />  father, the most powerful Narasimha I (1238-1264<br />  A.D.) who is known <br />  from his Lingaraja temple Inscriptions as a great<br />  patron of Saiva <br />  ascetics. The significance of the expression<br />  Ekadasa-Rudra-bhiksba is <br />  clear from the Tamil version, which states that the<br />  grant was made <br />  for the feeding of the Saiva ascetics for gaining<br />  the favour of <br />  elevan Rudras.<br />  The name of Nara Narasimha is found in an<br />  inscription of Saka 1203 in <br />  the Lakshmi-Narasimha temple at Simhachalam, in an<br />  inscription of <br />  1205 Saka in the DurgS Devi temple at Bhogapuram in<br />  two inscriptions <br />  of Saka 1215 m the Kurmesvara temple at Srikurmam,<br />  in the <br />  Ghandrasekhara temple in the Prataparudrapura Sasana<br />  in the Puri <br />  district. It was also issued in his 22nd Srahi like<br />  the two records <br />  under discussion in the village of Vaghamari<br />  (identified with the <br />  present Bhagamari village under Begunia P.S., Dist.<br />  - Puri) in favour <br />  of Siddhesvara matha at Sri Kirtivasa ksetra<br />  {Bhubaneswar) by <br />  Narasimha I.<br />  Nayaka was the <br />  father in-law (or maternal uncle) of Durgabhatta<br />  Acharya. It is also <br />  clear from its final portion that the land being<br />  free from debt was <br />  re dedicated for the purpose of the training and<br />  maintenance of <br />  ascetics who hailed from the three mandates of<br />  Choda, Pandya and <br />  Kanchi desa having being initiated in the<br />  conventional code of <br />  conduct in the various Mathas of these three regions<br />  in the <br />  Siddhesvara Matha at Bhubaneswar for the long life,<br />  health <br />=== message truncated ===</p></blockquote>

        <p>Wonderful documentation Mr. Bala.</p>
<p>I understand your hard work on this subject. Please put this subject in the newspapers based in Bhubaneswar, so that everybody will see this important note that may lead to so many entries. </p>
<p>Basically all saiva mutts in these area are from Tamilnadu and they spread saiva siththaandha sampradhaayam by establishing mutts from various places all over the country. The period you have mentioned here belong to the golden days of Saiva Siththaandham in Tamilnadu. Meikandaar, Umapathi Sivam (Saiva Achaaryas) had by then already established the siththaantham and those were followed by various Kings.</p>
<p>Your hard work should be known to outside world.</p>

The space in the left half of the stone is <br />occupied by an inscription in the Tamil language inscribed in Tamil <br />and grantha characters. The writing is in a fairly good state of <br />preservation.<br />Both the Oriya and Tamil sections of the inscription <br />refer to a transaction between a debtor and a creditor, the former <br />being a pontiff of a Matha of Tamilian Saivas at Bhubaneswar and the <br />letter a local Oriya moneyed man. That is why the document is written <br />in two different versions, Oriya and Tamil.</p>

Let the Sun, the <br />Moon, the Wind etc bear witness to this (transaction).</p>
<p>Historical Note<br />Both the inscriptions speak of two Narasimhas, of whom one has got <br />the distinguishing epithet "Bada"in Oriya and "Pousti" in Tamil; both <br />meaning big or elder and the other was Sri Vira Narasimhadeva during <br />whose reign the inscriptions under study were incised. Dr. Sircar <br />identifies the reigning monarch with Narasirnha IV and calculates the <br />date as 24th September, 1396 A D. But this identification is wrong as <br />the details of the date given in the records, 22 Srahi Kfirttfta <br />Krsna RavivSra, fully tally witti 2nd October.1295 A.D. when the 22nd <br />Anka year was current. In that case Bada Narasimhadeva was his grand <br />father, the most powerful Narasimha I (1238-1264 A.D.) who is known <br />from his Lingaraja temple Inscriptions as a great patron of Saiva <br />ascetics. The significance of the expression Ekadasa-Rudra-bhiksba is <br />clear from the Tamil version, which states that the grant was made <br />for the feeding of the Saiva ascetics for gaining the favour of <br />elevan Rudras.<br />The name of Nara Narasimha is found in an inscription of Saka 1203 in <br />the Lakshmi-Narasimha temple at Simhachalam, in an inscription of <br />1205 Saka in the DurgS Devi temple at Bhogapuram in two inscriptions <br />of Saka 1215 m the Kurmesvara temple at Srikurmam, in the <br />Ghandrasekhara temple in the Prataparudrapura Sasana in the Puri <br />district. It was also issued in his 22nd Srahi like the two records <br />under discussion in the village of Vaghamari (identified with the <br />present Bhagamari village under Begunia P.S., Dist. - Puri) in favour <br />of Siddhesvara matha at Sri Kirtivasa ksetra {Bhubaneswar) by <br />Narasimha I.<br />father in-law (or maternal uncle) of Durgabhatta Acharya. It is also <br />clear from its final portion that the land being free from debt was <br />re dedicated for the purpose of the training and maintenance of <br />ascetics who hailed from the three mandates of Choda, Pandya and <br />Kanchi desa having being initiated in the conventional code of <br />conduct in the various Mathas of these three regions in the <br />Siddhesvara Matha at Bhubaneswar for the long life, health and <br />prosperity of Vira Narasimhadeva. The use of the word Sampradaya, no <br />doubt refers to the conventions of a particular Saiva school, that <br />flourished in the Tamil country.<br />There is one discrepancy in the two records. The amount borrowed by <br />Taporaja mahamuni is stated to be 148 madhas in the Tamil Version, <br />whereas it is stated as 150 in its Oriya counterpart. The reason of <br />this discrepancy seems to be that 2 out of 150 madhas were paid to <br />the writer and the engraver of this document.</p>
<p>Oriya version of the multilingual Inscription</p>
<p>Translation<br />Lines 1-4 May there be success ! In the increasingly victori&shy; ous reign of the illustrious Vira Naranarasimhadeva year 22 Karttika <br />Krishna 7 Sunday.<br />Lines 4-18 Formerly an area of 12 Vatis of land at Vagha-mara <br />was granted as Ekadasa Rudrabhiksha in favour of Siddhesvara Matha at <br />the illustrious Krittivas Kshetra (i.e. Bhubaneswar) for the <br />longevity and fulfillment of the desires of the elder Narasimhadeva. <br />This land was mortgaged by Taporaja Mahamuni to Durgabhatta Acharya, <br />The amount borrowed was one hundred and fifty gold Madbas. He also <br />borrowed from Uttaresvara Nayaka in this case ten gold Mad has and <br />thirty Pautis of paddy. Having deposited these two items viz yaddy <br />and gold that had bean borrowed by Taporaja Mahamuni, to Uttaresvara <br />Nayaka, Durgabhatta Acharya calculated the sum payable to him by <br />Taporaja Mahamuni. On the paddy and gold being considered together <br />and the capital and interest being calculated the whole amount was <br />found to be one hundred and eighty gold Mad has.<br />Lines 18-26 When Taporaja Mahamuni obtained Siva (i.e. died) <br />Tapasehakravarti became the sthana-pati (i e. head of the matha). The <br />Tapaschakravarti's rasi (i.e. the constellation under which be was <br />born) was the same as that of Durgabhatta Acharya. Having learnt <br />this, Durgabhatta Acharya became a friendly party to Tapaschakravarti <br />because both of them belonged to the same rasi. Durgabhatta Acharya <br />poured water in the hands of (i.e. made a ceremonial offering in <br />favour of) Tapaschakravarti in respect of written document involving <br />one hundred and eighty gold coins and entitling him to enjoy the said <br />twelve vatis of land at Vaghamara.<br />Lines 26-34 He declared that the said land be made Ekadasa Rudra <br />bhiksha for the longevity and fulfillment of desires of the <br />illustrious Vira Naranarasimbadeva. This Bhiksha is meant for the <br />ascetics who are born in the three countries viz. Choda desa, Pandya <br />desa and Kanchi desa and who have obtained initiation in the various <br />Math as of those countries and become strict followers of the acharas <br />(pres&shy;cribed for the Mahesvaras). This Bhiksha is to for so long a <br />time as the Sun and Moon exist.</p>
<p>How the tamil oriya multilingual inscription discovered</p>
<p>While excavating a site for the foundation of a monastery near Gauri-<br />Kedara area of Bhubaneswar by his holiness Swami Kesavananda <br />Brahmachari in 1916, a stone tablet containing two inscription was <br />discovered. This was made over to Mr. Ganapati Siroar of the <br />Calcultta University who published an article with a good <br />illustration in the journal and proceedings of the Asiatic Society of <br />Bengal. Vol XX, 1924, PP 41ff. Recently the stone was secured for the <br />Ashutosh Museum of Indian Arts attached to the University of Calcutta.</p>
