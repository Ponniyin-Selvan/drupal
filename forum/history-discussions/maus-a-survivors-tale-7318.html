        <p>Venkat, Nero was not elected, was he? There has been lots of research gone into why Hitler was condoned - although it would be very unfair to say he is thought of on fair terms, most Germans regard with Holocaust with a very high degree of shame and responsbility and Germany ranks in the front of countries for human rights and charities related.</p>
<p>Hitler exploited the fact that Germany was very very poor country after World War I - and Jews were somewhat like Brahmins in our country, many of them educated, scholars, above middle class. He had lot of feelings of frustration around his parenting, which was very violent - his own father was illegitimate and violence was inherited in the family. He was an extremely powerful orator and the frustrated unemployed masses felt elated by the passionin his speeches. Hitler actually did not beleive a genocide to the extent he carried out was possible, until he found out for himself how indifferentthe real world was and then kept increasing the scale and degree of perpetuation. </p>
<p>The famous CNN reporter Christiana Amanpour recently made a documentary 'Scream Bloody Murder' - for all holocaust like 20th century massacres - Cambodia, Rwanda, Sri Lanka too. Indifference towards Evil remains a huge socialproblem - as also poverty and other inhuman situations which force people to believe in messiah like saviors.</p>

        <p>Venkat, yes very well put. Another very important point is that Hitler was a democratically elected head of state, which is why no ohter country or leader ever suspected he could be capable of such evil. The study of the Holocaust is thus so immensely important since it exposes the pitfalls of democracy - as we have seen and continue to see in North Africa and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>For those who are passionate about discussing this from a religious perspective I highly recommend Beliefnet.com. A very wnell moderated forum for discussing issues. The problem with regulating, th for government/legal issuesis one thing, the second thing I feel and have pointed out before - pleasemembers try to unders,tand that passions are different, I am saying so formyself also not just others. Being a hindu for some of us is a label, one we do wear with pride perhaps sometimes but not someting I want to die for since my spiritual belief is deeper than the label. It may not be so for others so please do not expect everyone to be as aroused and livid as you areat certain religious or casteist issues.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>  we should also look at nadir shah and timur lane invasions of india.<br />  both literally wiped out delhi.<br />  since it was a muslim state already most killed were muslims.</p>

<p>    Polish Jew Holocaust <br />    1. They were killed because they were jews and they had no choice(Because Hitlers intentions were to destroy Jews and not spread his race or religion)<br />    2. The Aryans also hated Polish people but they were allowed to live only the polish Jews were selected and killed.</p>
<p>    This to me was due to hatred of one person and a person who had the power to destroy the whole race of Jews.</p>
<p>    So this makes me feel your comparison doesn't match with Jew holocaust.But I feel the example you have give is very close to current situation inSri Lanka for Tamils. Slow and steady genocide of the Tamil people(and theworld doesn't accept it as holocaust).</p>

<p>        I am not belittling the sufferings of indians.<br />        a bulk of india was ruled by the muslims from 1200- 1800 in varying degrees of omnipotent power. <br />        varying numbers of hindus were killed in wars with them. agreed butthe fact remains hindus were a majority in any province ruled by the muslims.I dont think there was any attempt to wipe out the hindu race.<br />        the jewish holocaust differs because of the intention to wipe off the entire communities or groups hitler did not like.</p>

<p>      Venkatesh,</p>
<p>      I am definitely not generalizing. THere were lot of Muslim rulers whodid good to the country. No different opinion. </p>
<p>      But I am surprised to read such a mail from you.</p>
<p>      But apart from wars, it is a fact that Hindus were killed in crores just because they refused to convert to Islam. Starting from Arab, the islamic invasion extended till Afganistan and into India not only to conquer andloot, but also to wipe out the other religions and establish Islam. You only told me that Iran was converted into a caliphet in 300 years and afganishtan in 100 years etc. But inspite of 1000 years, if India could not be converted it is the fundamentals of Hindusim, which is beyond the scope of discussion.</p>
<p>      When the muslims invaded Afgan,was it not a buddist majority region? So the arguement that even in Muslim india, Hindus were majority doesnt hold any water.</p>
<p>      poona kanna moodina ulagam irundu pogathu.</p>
<p>      Till the date we dont have the guts to accept the facts as facts, India can never be a true secular country and India can never become a developed country.</p>

        <p>Dear <br />?<br />Namaskar - Greetings !!!<br />?<br />People have their Own Opinion and guts to open them is a matter of strength.. I must congratulate them?all.<br />?<br />By Birth, by?Living,?by Behaviour?and by Soul , A Hindu is a secular.Because this word comes from treating all as Humans and this is the basic of all the theories of Hindus and our Mythology. Our all spiritual and religious literature lead to the same. <br />?<br />No sane thinks to introduce the tides to the ocean. We are the Ocean, the people who try to teach and discuss this with Hindu must not be the sane. <br />?<br />We don't live physically or in body only, we are thoughts and a?symbol, an expression and signature of nature. <br />?<br />Masjid Mein Baith Main Om Japoon, Girija Mein Shree Krishan Ke Darshan Karoon<br />Jis Mein Janame Budh, Nanak, Govind, ?"Hriday" Main Hindu Hoon Sab Man?Mein Rahoon.<br />?<br />Main Tan Se Adhik, Budhi Se Adhik, Main Vayu?Sa Hoon Shwasoan Se Adhik<br />Mera Rahna Muskanoan Mein Hai<br />Jeewan Mein Hai, Balidanoan Mein Hai<br />Main Ladta Nahin Apne Tan Ke Liye <br />Le Loon Jeewan Main Watan Ke Liya<br />Main Hindu Hooan Ashru Mein Rahoon, Duje Ki Bundein Main Sah Na Sakoon<br />Main Jeete Bina Sab Mein Jeeta, "Hriday" Main Hindu Hoon Sab Man Mein Rahoon.<br />?<br />?<br />?Reagards</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>we should also look at nadir shah and timur lane invasions of india.<br />both literally wiped out delhi.<br />since it was a muslim state already most killed were muslims.</p>
<p>i personally feel its ''man against man and not 'religion against religion'..</p>

<p>  This to me was due to hatred of one person and a person who had the powerto destroy the whole race of Jews.</p>
<p>  So this makes me feel your comparison doesn't match with Jew holocaust. But I feel the example you have give is very close to current situation in Sri Lanka for Tamils. Slow and steady genocide of the Tamil people(and the world doesn't accept it as holocaust).</p>

<p>    But I am surprised to read such a mail from you.</p>
<p>    But apart from wars, it is a fact that Hindus were killed in crores just because they refused to convert to Islam. Starting from Arab, the islamicinvasion extended till Afganistan and into India not only to conquer and loot, but also to wipe out the other religions and establish Islam. You onlytold me that Iran was converted into a caliphet in 300 years and afganishtan in 100 years etc. But inspite of 1000 years, if India could not be converted it is the fundamentals of Hindusim, which is beyond the scope of discussion.</p>
<p>    When the muslims invaded Afgan,was it not a buddist majority region? Sothe arguement that even in Muslim india, Hindus were majority doesnt hold any water.</p>

<p>    Till the date we dont have the guts to accept the facts as facts, Indiacan never be a true secular country and India can never become a developedcountry.</p>

<p>  Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  I am definitely not generalizing. THere were lot of Muslim rulers who didgood to the country. No different opinion. </p>
<p>  But I am surprised to read such a mail from you.</p>
<p>  But apart from wars, it is a fact that Hindus were killed in crores just because they refused to convert to Islam. Starting from Arab, the islamic invasion extended till Afganistan and into India not only to conquer and loot, but also to wipe out the other religions and establish Islam. You only told me that Iran was converted into a caliphet in 300 years and afganishtanin 100 years etc. But inspite of 1000 years, if India could not be converted it is the fundamentals of Hindusim, which is beyond the scope of discussion.</p>
<p>  When the muslims invaded Afgan,was it not a buddist majority region? So the arguement that even in Muslim india, Hindus were majority doesnt hold any water.</p>
<p>  poona kanna moodina ulagam irundu pogathu.</p>
<p>  Till the date we dont have the guts to accept the facts as facts, India can never be a true secular country and India can never become a developed country.</p>

<p>I agree one cannot generalize. But if you make a list of your quoted<br />good deeds in one column, and the atrocities, killings, forced<br />conversion by all the muslim kings in the second column, which will have<br />more entries? One thing you keep forgetting is the intention behind the<br />action/result . If hindus have survived, it is due to their tenacity and<br />self-preserving instincts. Of course it has been achieved with loss of<br />population and territory- diminishing returns. Even in the last half<br />century, you know what has happened in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kashmir.<br />This burrying the head in the sand will cost us dear. How the data and<br />statistics are hidden and obfuscated?</p>
<p>I hope 'we hindus' refer to 'royal we' or 'editoral we' or 'patronising<br />we' hindu and not all hindus. I do not belong to that 'we hindu' group<br />which compares Mahabharata war with holocost.</p>
<p>It is not wise to club all casualities and all types of killing in one<br />basket. The man behind and the motive are important.</p>

        <p>Dear Sathish, as Venkat clearly said I don't believe there was any organised ethnic cleansing of hindus - btw which is not just Venkat's statement lotof people have said it including historians and political commentators. That is not to say hindus did not suffer any abuse it is just to say it did not happen like it did with Jews during holocaust.</p>
<p>We can argue on other things you said in this thread, just i am not intrested in that because i dont' believe this is the right forum for this debate.I was only responding to Vairam's book recomenddation and it went somewhere from there into hindu muslim stuff.</p>

<p>    Actually I think we agree on the basics. What reminded me of the Mahabharat is the link you sent it referenced to Kandahar in relation to Mahabhart. I believe it is not history but was talking with reference to that that is all.</p>
<p>    The whole hindu muslim argument is a very different subject. Just fyi most of those crimes are war crimes or war related crimes only. It is <br />    a very very hot subject and definitely completely unsuitable for this forum - nobody is backing off in my opinion if we say hindus of the past =hindus of the present and muslims of the past = muslims of the present adhu adi dhadila dhaan poi nikkum. It is best left alone.</p>
<p>    Malathi</p>
<p>  Already I made it clear...world accusing Germans is in no way meaning theworld will attack germans.</p>
<p>  And the article also talks many things about Kandahar apart from Mahabarath. </p>
<p>  Give me one valid reason why Nazis killing Jews is different from MuslimgKilling Hindus? Again I am not talking about war killings, but purely on religious basis where Hindus were killed in lakhs just because they refused to convert. Both are history and brushing aside one is no way fair.</p>

<p>Give me one valid reason why Nazis killing Jews is different from Muslimg Killing Hindus? Again I am not talking about war killings, but purely on religious basis where Hindus were killed in lakhs just because they refused toconvert. Both are history and brushing aside one is no way fair.</p>

<p>    Hi Satish, I don't want to argue with you too, although I dont' like generalising and dismissing people like 'obvious'.</p>
<p>    I was only saying it is an apples to oranges comparison. Meaning wars were a way of life in those days everyone killed everyone else. We can argueof course on who killed more hindus or muslims but that is a different line of argument than the holocaust.</p>
<p>    I know venkat said it is the greatest of crimes and that is a fairly common statement many people make. There are jews and holocaust survivors whoalso prefer to call it as nothing more than a crime that should not happenagain.</p>
<p>    Malathi</p>
<p>  Jewish holocaust is the worst crime on mankind - General statement through out the world... </p>
<p>  Jewish holocaust is - killing of jews just because they are jews and not christians. </p>
<p>  Everyone seems to agree so far....okva...</p>
<p>  Also, including you, everyone says that we should learn from history because we should not repeat the same mistakes again.</p>
<p>  Again, i think everyone agrees till here.</p>
<p>  What I am saying is, Muslims have killed more Hindus than the Nazis killed jews, becuase Muslims also killed hindus for the simple reason that they are not muslims. And these killings are not during wartime but even during peace time. I mentioned this even in my earlier mail Is it not an holocaust?</p>
<p>  You only bought in the arguement of war. Killing during war, till date isin practice. I am not talking about wars. you are comparing holocaust to war and telling me i am comparing apples to oranges? strange</p>
<p>  I really dont understand why people take a back seat when we talk about muslims killing hindus. Is it that big a crime to call a rose a rose? we saywe have to learn from history, but when it is pointed that history shows that hindu holocaust is much bigger than jewish holocaust, why people make ahue and cry? </p>
<p>  It is not comparing who killed the most..it is just reminding the TRUE history so that it does not repeat itself. But are we doing it? If we talk jewish holocaust, we are intellectuals. But if we talk Hindu holocaust, we are communal...enna nyayam ithu?</p>
<p>  Germans are humbled by the whole world by repeatedly pointing out thier historical mistake. It does not imply that the whole world is hating Germansadn going to attack and kill them.</p>
<p>  But we Indians dont want to talk about our horrific history but will go to lenghts praising the holocaust stories told by the jews. really amusing... :) this is called hipocrasy.</p>
<p>  And coming back to arguements....when we discuss about Mahabaratha and Ramayana, you say those are myths.</p>
<p>  But when we talk about history...you say Mahabaratha has more horror thanthis history....what do you think I should deduce from this?</p>

<p>Venkatesh,</p>
<p>I am definitely not generalizing. THere were lot of Muslim rulers who did good to the country. No different opinion. </p>
<p>But I am surprised to read such a mail from you.</p>
<p>But apart from wars, it is a fact that Hindus were killed in crores just because they refused to convert to Islam. Starting from Arab, the islamic invasion extended till Afganistan and into India not only to conquer and loot,but also to wipe out the other religions and establish Islam. You only told me that Iran was converted into a caliphet in 300 years and afganishtan in 100 years etc. But inspite of 1000 years, if India could not be convertedit is the fundamentals of Hindusim, which is beyond the scope of discussion.</p>
<p>When the muslims invaded Afgan,was it not a buddist majority region? So thearguement that even in Muslim india, Hindus were majority doesnt hold any water.</p>
<p>poona kanna moodina ulagam irundu pogathu.</p>
<p>Till the date we dont have the guts to accept the facts as facts, India cannever be a true secular country and India can never become a developed country.</p>

<p>Jewish holocaust is the worst crime on mankind - General statement through out the world... </p>
<p>Jewish holocaust is - killing of jews just because they are jews and not christians. </p>
<p>Everyone seems to agree so far....okva...</p>
<p>Also, including you, everyone says that we should learn from history because we should not repeat the same mistakes again.</p>
<p>Again, i think everyone agrees till here.</p>
<p>What I am saying is, Muslims have killed more Hindus than the Nazis killed jews, becuase Muslims also killed hindus for the simple reason that they are not muslims. And these killings are not during wartime but even during peace time. I mentioned this even in my earlier mail Is it not an holocaust?</p>
<p>You only bought in the arguement of war. Killing during war, till date is in practice. I am not talking about wars. you are comparing holocaust to war and telling me i am comparing apples to oranges? strange</p>
<p>I really dont understand why people take a back seat when we talk about muslims killing hindus. Is it that big a crime to call a rose a rose? we say we have to learn from history, but when it is pointed that history shows that hindu holocaust is much bigger than jewish holocaust, why people make a hue and cry? </p>
<p>It is not comparing who killed the most..it is just reminding the TRUE history so that it does not repeat itself. But are we doing it? If we talk jewish holocaust, we are intellectuals. But if we talk Hindu holocaust, we are communal...enna nyayam ithu?</p>
<p>Germans are humbled by the whole world by repeatedly pointing out thier historical mistake. It does not imply that the whole world is hating Germans adn going to attack and kill them.</p>
<p>But we Indians dont want to talk about our horrific history but will go to lenghts praising the holocaust stories told by the jews. really amusing... :) this is called hipocrasy.</p>
<p>And coming back to arguements....when we discuss about Mahabaratha and Ramayana, you say those are myths.</p>
<p>But when we talk about history...you say Mahabaratha has more horror than this history....what do you think I should deduce from this?</p>

        <p>Let us say the holocaust is among the worst crimes of the 20th century. If we want to go back in history and take into account wars then it is impossible really to say who was the greater murderer than whom, let alone on basis of religion.</p>
<p>What beats the Mahabharat in terms of volume and mass murder assuming that happeneed? Hindus murdering Hindus perhaps tnt hat is better than Muslims murdering Hindus? Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  I am not justifying Kandahar or anything just that wars before 18th century cannot be classified on the same count as modernday genocides.</p>
<p>Perhaps better compare something like Jallianwala Bagh, Partition riots, and so on to the Holocaust if at all a comparison is warrantied. And even if we allow room for all this there is no real pride in saying we (=Hindus) lost 1000 people a day. I heard this from so many wise Jewish friends when talks on the holocaust come up. It is nothign we take pride in or seek pityabout other than a horrific historic incident that should not be repeated and there are many. That is all.</p>

        <p>Hi Venkat, the purpose of learning more on holocaust type of incidents is as you said the fact that history repeats itself and two is the phenomenal amount of human sensitivity and inspiration that came out of this horror. The best books written on the holocaust in fact contain very minimal descriptions of horrific incidents just the emotional courage and challenges it presented. </p>
<p>Elie Weisel's Night and Mark Klempner's The Heart has reasons are two of the best I have read.</p>
