</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>There are Mantra rajam, Yantra rajam and Tantra rajam, for Srividhya <br />upasana marga.</p>
<p>Panchadasi is said to be Mantrarajam (many say Shodashi), and <br />Srichakra as Yantrarajam.</p>
<p>Though Adhi Shankarar was Shanmathasthaapakar, there are many, <br />including myself, who believe he is a Shaktha. There are reasons for <br />this. There is a story that he first chose Srilalitha Sahasranam for <br />Bhashya and Godess herself gave him Vishnu Sahasranam for that <br />purpose, and told him, that, she has chosen someone else for that <br />purpose. He name is Baskarayar. He migrated from north to south and <br />stayed near Kumbakonam. There is a place called Baskararayapuram.</p>
<p>Srichakram, as Venkat said, has predominant nine triangles, and <br />which is vital for Nava Avarana Puja. And it is very auspicious to <br />perform this puja on a Full Moon day. Especially during Chitra <br />Pournami.</p>
<p>These yantras has tendency to full fill wishes. Adhi Shankara, is <br />said to have installed Dhana Aakarshana Yantra, at Thirupathi. But <br />many say it was Suka Brahmar, the son of Veda Vyasa, who has done <br />it. But, the effect is very much visible.</p>
<p>Srichakra, is gaurded on four gates by Ashtamaasiddhi, one on each <br />side of the gate. These siddhis are Anima,Mahima, Lagima, Garima, <br />Eshithva, Vashitva, prapti, and pragamya.</p>
<p>Actually a Shri Chakra has all the gods and goddess in it. There are <br />text, that sayd it is Shiva Chakra, if it is placed upside down. So, <br />Shiva-Shakthi aikyam. She is Shiva-Shakthi Aikya roopini as per <br />Srilalitha Sahasranama.</p>
<p>Srichakra is the abode of Shiva-shakthi, Vishnu-lakshmi, brahma-<br />Vani, and many other innumerable goddess. She is said to be served <br />to 64 Crore yoginis. Infact, there are group of Brahmins, who <br />challenged Baskararayar on this name. And Baskararayar, worshipped <br />goddess and she sat as a Parrot (Brahmasuki) on his shoulders, <br />ivisible to others. She started saying the names and characterestic <br />of 64 crore yoginis and those group worshipped him and accepted the <br />defeat. She is 'Chathushati Koti Yogini Parisevidha'.</p>
<p>I will write soon more on Srichakram. There may be many members, who <br />might know vast and more information. And they can enlighten you <br />more.</p>

<blockquote><p>  venkatesh sir,</p>
<p>  i was amazed when i saw srichakram for the firs time in sivakami <br />  amman koil... but later when i started visiting various temples <br />like <br />  kamakshi temple ,tiruvotriyur , margabandhu temple at <br />virinchipuram <br />  and others, i saw srichakrams installed in all places</p>
<p>  invariably by adisankarar... what is the significance of <br />installing <br />  srichakram in amman temples and why was adisankara so hell bent on <br />  installing the same</p>
<p>  even though there are chakram's for each god like pillaiyar, <br />murugan <br />  and sivan, why is srichakram given so much importance and why are <br />  the other chakrams not so prevalent as srichakram???</p>

<p>    the form of abirami is said to fit into the shape of the sri <br />  chakram</p>
<p>    there is a good version of srichakram near sivakama sundari <br />temple-</p>
<p>    chidambaram .</p>

<p>      Srichakram is the yantra of Devi Lalitha Parameshwari. It is <br />in <br />    line <br />      with Panchadasakshari Mantra, Sriguru, Lalitha and, Sadhaka. <br />      Srividhyoupasakas worships, this Yantra as Devi herself.</p>
<p>      Sloka 11 of Soudarya Lahari and, Sloka 'Srichakram Shruthi <br />      mulakosha..' of Shakthi Mahimana sthotram will eloborate on <br />      Srichakra.</p>
<p>      There needs to be a clean heart and external cleanliness for <br />  this <br />      worship. Mostly done by people who have been given a Dheekdha <br />to <br />      Shrivishya Upaasana marga. It is the source of entire universe <br />  or <br />      belived to be.</p>
<p>      It is the top view of Maha Meru, which can be seen in Devi <br />  temples <br />      eg. Saratha temple near Meenakshi College, and Agathiyar <br />temple <br />    near <br />      pondy bazzar in T.Nagar.</p>
<p>      It acted as a chariot for Devi, on her war against <br />      Bandaura, 'Shrichakra rahta rooda'</p>

When Sadhaka is good, the <br />  results were amazing, she can grant anything. I will narrate an <br />  incident, which was told to me by an upasaka.</p>
<p>  There was a Srividhya Upasaka, at Karnataka. He was very initiated <br />  to `Soubhagya Panchadasi'. It is Panchadasi with Lakshmi Beejam to <br />  its end.. He recited crores and crores of this manta and Mother <br />  appeared before him, and he asked for more and more money. But, <br />  Universal Mother laughed at him and said, he cannot have wealth <br />this <br />  Janma. So he remembered what Adhishankara did and was initiated to <br />  sanyaasa, which means he got another Janma. He then asked the <br />  Universal Mother for wealth. And it seems she poured wealth like <br />  rain. But, alas he remembered, that he is a sanyasin and cannot <br />  touch money. Then he started thinking on what he can do with this <br />  money.</p>
<p>  This happened at times when Muslim rulers were invading south. So <br />he <br />  decided to make use of this money to start an empire. And <br />  Vijayanagara samraajyam, started this was. The upasaka was called <br />  Vidhyaranya, and he had been a pontiff, of Sringeri Sharadha <br />peetam.</p>
<p>  May be someone can try this with atmost devotion, and Tamil Nadu, <br />  can be come house of all fortunes. </p>
<p>  Yes, Srichakram has got lots of triangles, and there is a count <br />and <br />  I don't remember correctly. The significance of this Chakram is <br />it, <br />  covers all devatas. There is a book written by Baskararayar <br />  called `Varivasya rahasyam' that explains this very precisely.<br />  It explains the link between Mantra/Yantra, and Ganesha, Graha, <br />  Nakshatra, Yoginis, Rasi and Peetam. She is also called `Ganesha <br />  Graha Nakshatra Yogini Rasi peeta roopineem'. </p>
<p>  Srividhya is an ocean, there are lots of information, puja, <br />Yantra, <br />  Mantra, Tantra and Rahasyas in it.</p>

<p>    RC,</p>
<p>    my doubt is why are there so many triangles inside the <br />chakram??? <br />    what is the significance of that chakram...</p>
<p>    there was once person called "muthukrishnan" i believe, who used <br />  to <br />    come in TV and talk about srichakram and said that he will help <br />    people with srichakram ( by taking money ofcourse)... but enge <br />    ponaarnne theriyalai</p>

<p>      Yes, there are many similarities between Pyraminds and these <br />      triangles. As pyraminds are said to confine the energy, is it <br />      belived even koil gopurams are inform of those. But, I am very <br />    weak <br />      on scientific part of this.</p>
<p>      The development of Srichakram is Maha Meru. This Maha Meru, is <br />      worshipped by Srividhyopasakas, who are very well versed in <br />    mantras, <br />      usually people , who have been given Dheekshai on Shodashi or <br />      Panchadashi, has adhikaaram to worship Maha Meru and that too <br />    after <br />      thier Guru, gives them a nod.</p>
<p>      Each and every Guru tradition, will be different. And Mantras <br />      initiated and way of Puja and everything may differ. <br />  MahaGanapathi <br />      and Guru Pathukai is first and then comes others.</p>

<p>        Excellent information.... ivvalavu vishayam irukka <br />        srichakrathukulla???</p>
<p>        but what is the significance of the form of the chakram??? i <br />    mean <br />        the shape?? how does it benefit and concentrate all <br />energies???</p>
<p>        any similarity between pyramids and srichakram for i find <br />both <br />      have <br />        lot of triangles...</p>
<p>        there is a place in North karnataka called Hubli which many <br />of <br />    us <br />        are familiar... one striking thing is that many road <br />junctions <br />      would <br />        be in the form of triangle in that place.. i do not know why <br />  and <br />        would there be any impact of that on the functioning and <br />      prosperity <br />        of the town??</p>

<p>          Panchadasi is said to be Mantrarajam (many say Shodashi), <br />  and <br />          Srichakra as Yantrarajam.</p>
<p>          Though Adhi Shankarar was Shanmathasthaapakar, there are <br />  many, <br />          including myself, who believe he is a Shaktha. There are <br />    reasons <br />        for <br />          this. There is a story that he first chose Srilalitha <br />    Sahasranam <br />        for <br />          Bhashya and Godess herself gave him Vishnu Sahasranam for <br />  that <br />          purpose, and told him, that, she has chosen someone else <br />for <br />      that <br />          purpose. He name is Baskarayar. He migrated from north to <br />    south <br />        and <br />          stayed near Kumbakonam. There is a place called <br />    Baskararayapuram.</p>
<p>          Srichakram, as Venkat said, has predominant nine <br />triangles, <br />    and <br />          which is vital for Nava Avarana Puja. And it is very <br />    auspicious <br />      to <br />          perform this puja on a Full Moon day. Especially during <br />  Chitra <br />          Pournami.</p>
<p>          These yantras has tendency to full fill wishes. Adhi <br />  Shankara, <br />      is <br />          said to have installed Dhana Aakarshana Yantra, at <br />  Thirupathi. <br />      But <br />          many say it was Suka Brahmar, the son of Veda Vyasa, who <br />has <br />      done <br />          it. But, the effect is very much visible.</p>
<p>          Srichakra, is gaurded on four gates by Ashtamaasiddhi, one <br />  on <br />      each <br />          side of the gate. These siddhis are Anima,Mahima, Lagima, <br />      Garima, <br />          Eshithva, Vashitva, prapti, and pragamya.</p>
<p>          Actually a Shri Chakra has all the gods and goddess in it. <br />    There <br />        are <br />          text, that sayd it is Shiva Chakra, if it is placed upside <br />    down. <br />        So, <br />          Shiva-Shakthi aikyam. She is Shiva-Shakthi Aikya roopini <br />as <br />    per <br />          Srilalitha Sahasranama.</p>
<p>          Srichakra is the abode of Shiva-shakthi, Vishnu-lakshmi, <br />    brahma-<br />          Vani, and many other innumerable goddess. She is said to <br />be <br />      served <br />          to 64 Crore yoginis. Infact, there are group of Brahmins, <br />  who <br />          challenged Baskararayar on this name. And Baskararayar, <br />      worshipped <br />          goddess and she sat as a Parrot (Brahmasuki) on his <br />  shoulders, <br />          ivisible to others. She started saying the names and <br />        characterestic <br />          of 64 crore yoginis and those group worshipped him and <br />    accepted <br />        the <br />          defeat. She is 'Chathushati Koti Yogini Parisevidha'.</p>
<p>          I will write soon more on Srichakram. There may be many <br />    members, <br />        who <br />          might know vast and more information. And they can <br />enlighten <br />    you <br />          more.</p>

<p>                Srichakram is the yantra of Devi Lalitha <br />Parameshwari. <br />    It <br />      is <br />          in <br />              line <br />                with Panchadasakshari Mantra, Sriguru, Lalitha and, <br />      Sadhaka. <br />                Srividhyoupasakas worships, this Yantra as Devi <br />  herself.</p>

        <p>Irukalam, the upasana is very dangerous too. Gurus say, it is <br />like 'Karanam thappina maranam'. Goddess does not care for who the <br />sadhaka is, when they do atrocities. When Sadhaka is good, the <br />results were amazing, she can grant anything. I will narrate an <br />incident, which was told to me by an upasaka.</p>
<p>There was a Srividhya Upasaka, at Karnataka. He was very initiated <br />to `Soubhagya Panchadasi'. It is Panchadasi with Lakshmi Beejam to <br />its end.. He recited crores and crores of this manta and Mother <br />appeared before him, and he asked for more and more money. But, <br />Universal Mother laughed at him and said, he cannot have wealth this <br />Janma. So he remembered what Adhishankara did and was initiated to <br />sanyaasa, which means he got another Janma. He then asked the <br />Universal Mother for wealth. And it seems she poured wealth like <br />rain. But, alas he remembered, that he is a sanyasin and cannot <br />touch money. Then he started thinking on what he can do with this <br />money.</p>
<p>This happened at times when Muslim rulers were invading south. So he <br />decided to make use of this money to start an empire. And <br />Vijayanagara samraajyam, started this was. The upasaka was called <br />Vidhyaranya, and he had been a pontiff, of Sringeri Sharadha peetam.</p>
<p>May be someone can try this with atmost devotion, and Tamil Nadu, <br />can be come house of all fortunes. </p>
<p>Yes, Srichakram has got lots of triangles, and there is a count and <br />I don't remember correctly. The significance of this Chakram is it, <br />covers all devatas. There is a book written by Baskararayar <br />called `Varivasya rahasyam' that explains this very precisely.<br />It explains the link between Mantra/Yantra, and Ganesha, Graha, <br />Nakshatra, Yoginis, Rasi and Peetam. She is also called `Ganesha <br />Graha Nakshatra Yogini Rasi peeta roopineem'. </p>
<p>Srividhya is an ocean, there are lots of information, puja, Yantra, <br />Mantra, Tantra and Rahasyas in it.</p>

<blockquote><p>  RC,</p>
<p>  my doubt is why are there so many triangles inside the chakram??? <br />  what is the significance of that chakram...</p>
<p>  there was once person called "muthukrishnan" i believe, who used <br />to <br />  come in TV and talk about srichakram and said that he will help <br />  people with srichakram ( by taking money ofcourse)... but enge <br />  ponaarnne theriyalai</p>

<p>    Yes, there are many similarities between Pyraminds and these <br />    triangles. As pyraminds are said to confine the energy, is it <br />    belived even koil gopurams are inform of those. But, I am very <br />  weak <br />    on scientific part of this.</p>
<p>    The development of Srichakram is Maha Meru. This Maha Meru, is <br />    worshipped by Srividhyopasakas, who are very well versed in <br />  mantras, <br />    usually people , who have been given Dheekshai on Shodashi or <br />    Panchadashi, has adhikaaram to worship Maha Meru and that too <br />  after <br />    thier Guru, gives them a nod.</p>
<p>    Each and every Guru tradition, will be different. And Mantras <br />    initiated and way of Puja and everything may differ. <br />MahaGanapathi <br />    and Guru Pathukai is first and then comes others.</p>

<p>      Excellent information.... ivvalavu vishayam irukka <br />      srichakrathukulla???</p>
<p>      but what is the significance of the form of the chakram??? i <br />  mean <br />      the shape?? how does it benefit and concentrate all energies???</p>
<p>      any similarity between pyramids and srichakram for i find both <br />    have <br />      lot of triangles...</p>
<p>      there is a place in North karnataka called Hubli which many of <br />  us <br />      are familiar... one striking thing is that many road junctions <br />    would <br />      be in the form of triangle in that place.. i do not know why <br />and <br />      would there be any impact of that on the functioning and <br />    prosperity <br />      of the town??</p>

<p>        Panchadasi is said to be Mantrarajam (many say Shodashi), <br />and <br />        Srichakra as Yantrarajam.</p>
<p>        Though Adhi Shankarar was Shanmathasthaapakar, there are <br />many, <br />        including myself, who believe he is a Shaktha. There are <br />  reasons <br />      for <br />        this. There is a story that he first chose Srilalitha <br />  Sahasranam <br />      for <br />        Bhashya and Godess herself gave him Vishnu Sahasranam for <br />that <br />        purpose, and told him, that, she has chosen someone else for <br />    that <br />        purpose. He name is Baskarayar. He migrated from north to <br />  south <br />      and <br />        stayed near Kumbakonam. There is a place called <br />  Baskararayapuram.</p>
<p>        Srichakram, as Venkat said, has predominant nine triangles, <br />  and <br />        which is vital for Nava Avarana Puja. And it is very <br />  auspicious <br />    to <br />        perform this puja on a Full Moon day. Especially during <br />Chitra <br />        Pournami.</p>
<p>        These yantras has tendency to full fill wishes. Adhi <br />Shankara, <br />    is <br />        said to have installed Dhana Aakarshana Yantra, at <br />Thirupathi. <br />    But <br />        many say it was Suka Brahmar, the son of Veda Vyasa, who has <br />    done <br />        it. But, the effect is very much visible.</p>
<p>        Srichakra, is gaurded on four gates by Ashtamaasiddhi, one <br />on <br />    each <br />        side of the gate. These siddhis are Anima,Mahima, Lagima, <br />    Garima, <br />        Eshithva, Vashitva, prapti, and pragamya.</p>
<p>        Actually a Shri Chakra has all the gods and goddess in it. <br />  There <br />      are <br />        text, that sayd it is Shiva Chakra, if it is placed upside <br />  down. <br />      So, <br />        Shiva-Shakthi aikyam. She is Shiva-Shakthi Aikya roopini as <br />  per <br />        Srilalitha Sahasranama.</p>
<p>        Srichakra is the abode of Shiva-shakthi, Vishnu-lakshmi, <br />  brahma-<br />        Vani, and many other innumerable goddess. She is said to be <br />    served <br />        to 64 Crore yoginis. Infact, there are group of Brahmins, <br />who <br />        challenged Baskararayar on this name. And Baskararayar, <br />    worshipped <br />        goddess and she sat as a Parrot (Brahmasuki) on his <br />shoulders, <br />        ivisible to others. She started saying the names and <br />      characterestic <br />        of 64 crore yoginis and those group worshipped him and <br />  accepted <br />      the <br />        defeat. She is 'Chathushati Koti Yogini Parisevidha'.</p>
<p>        I will write soon more on Srichakram. There may be many <br />  members, <br />      who <br />        might know vast and more information. And they can enlighten <br />  you <br />        more.</p>

<p>          i was amazed when i saw srichakram for the firs time in <br />    sivakami <br />          amman koil... but later when i started visiting various <br />    temples <br />        like <br />          kamakshi temple ,tiruvotriyur , margabandhu temple at <br />        virinchipuram <br />          and others, i saw srichakrams installed in all places</p>
<p>          invariably by adisankarar... what is the significance of <br />        installing <br />          srichakram in amman temples and why was adisankara so hell <br />    bent <br />      on <br />          installing the same</p>
<p>          even though there are chakram's for each god like <br />pillaiyar, <br />        murugan <br />          and sivan, why is srichakram given so much importance and <br />  why <br />      are <br />          the other chakrams not so prevalent as srichakram???</p>

<p>              Srichakram is the yantra of Devi Lalitha Parameshwari. <br />  It <br />    is <br />        in <br />            line <br />              with Panchadasakshari Mantra, Sriguru, Lalitha and, <br />    Sadhaka. <br />              Srividhyoupasakas worships, this Yantra as Devi <br />herself.</p>
<p>              Sloka 11 of Soudarya Lahari and, Sloka 'Srichakram <br />  Shruthi <br />              mulakosha..' of Shakthi Mahimana sthotram will <br />eloborate <br />    on <br />              Srichakra.</p>

<p>  Yes, there are many similarities between Pyraminds and these <br />  triangles. As pyraminds are said to confine the energy, is it <br />  belived even koil gopurams are inform of those. But, I am very <br />weak <br />  on scientific part of this.</p>
<p>  The development of Srichakram is Maha Meru. This Maha Meru, is <br />  worshipped by Srividhyopasakas, who are very well versed in <br />mantras, <br />  usually people , who have been given Dheekshai on Shodashi or <br />  Panchadashi, has adhikaaram to worship Maha Meru and that too <br />after <br />  thier Guru, gives them a nod.</p>
<p>  Each and every Guru tradition, will be different. And Mantras <br />  initiated and way of Puja and everything may differ. MahaGanapathi <br />  and Guru Pathukai is first and then comes others.</p>

<p>    Dear RC,</p>
<p>    Excellent information.... ivvalavu vishayam irukka <br />    srichakrathukulla???</p>
<p>    but what is the significance of the form of the chakram??? i <br />mean <br />    the shape?? how does it benefit and concentrate all energies???</p>
<p>    any similarity between pyramids and srichakram for i find both <br />  have <br />    lot of triangles...</p>
<p>    there is a place in North karnataka called Hubli which many of <br />us <br />    are familiar... one striking thing is that many road junctions <br />  would <br />    be in the form of triangle in that place.. i do not know why and <br />    would there be any impact of that on the functioning and <br />  prosperity <br />    of the town??</p>

<p>      Panchadasi is said to be Mantrarajam (many say Shodashi), and <br />      Srichakra as Yantrarajam.</p>
<p>      Though Adhi Shankarar was Shanmathasthaapakar, there are many, <br />      including myself, who believe he is a Shaktha. There are <br />reasons <br />    for <br />      this. There is a story that he first chose Srilalitha <br />Sahasranam <br />    for <br />      Bhashya and Godess herself gave him Vishnu Sahasranam for that <br />      purpose, and told him, that, she has chosen someone else for <br />  that <br />      purpose. He name is Baskarayar. He migrated from north to <br />south <br />    and <br />      stayed near Kumbakonam. There is a place called <br />Baskararayapuram.</p>
<p>      Srichakram, as Venkat said, has predominant nine triangles, <br />and <br />      which is vital for Nava Avarana Puja. And it is very <br />auspicious <br />  to <br />      perform this puja on a Full Moon day. Especially during Chitra <br />      Pournami.</p>
<p>      These yantras has tendency to full fill wishes. Adhi Shankara, <br />  is <br />      said to have installed Dhana Aakarshana Yantra, at Thirupathi. <br />  But <br />      many say it was Suka Brahmar, the son of Veda Vyasa, who has <br />  done <br />      it. But, the effect is very much visible.</p>
<p>      Srichakra, is gaurded on four gates by Ashtamaasiddhi, one on <br />  each <br />      side of the gate. These siddhis are Anima,Mahima, Lagima, <br />  Garima, <br />      Eshithva, Vashitva, prapti, and pragamya.</p>
<p>      Actually a Shri Chakra has all the gods and goddess in it. <br />There <br />    are <br />      text, that sayd it is Shiva Chakra, if it is placed upside <br />down. <br />    So, <br />      Shiva-Shakthi aikyam. She is Shiva-Shakthi Aikya roopini as <br />per <br />      Srilalitha Sahasranama.</p>
<p>      Srichakra is the abode of Shiva-shakthi, Vishnu-lakshmi, <br />brahma-<br />      Vani, and many other innumerable goddess. She is said to be <br />  served <br />      to 64 Crore yoginis. Infact, there are group of Brahmins, who <br />      challenged Baskararayar on this name. And Baskararayar, <br />  worshipped <br />      goddess and she sat as a Parrot (Brahmasuki) on his shoulders, <br />      ivisible to others. She started saying the names and <br />    characterestic <br />      of 64 crore yoginis and those group worshipped him and <br />accepted <br />    the <br />      defeat. She is 'Chathushati Koti Yogini Parisevidha'.</p>
<p>      I will write soon more on Srichakram. There may be many <br />members, <br />    who <br />      might know vast and more information. And they can enlighten <br />you <br />      more.</p>

<p>            There needs to be a clean heart and external cleanliness <br />  for <br />        this <br />            worship.

        <p>Yes, She was once very ferocious and beyond control, and same with <br />Kamakshi, she had even got Narabali. None of the devotees could <br />control her. Also Mangadu.</p>
<p>Adhishakara, confined there energies to Srichakram and made her <br />sowmyam. But, I would say, he had begged the divine mother to become <br />sowmyam, and Mother promised him not to become fearsome again.</p>
<p>Even many places even now, happend, when any god or goddess is very <br />Ugram, people to perform abhishekam to pacify her. And this Yantra <br />prathishtai is also a form of pacifying. It is because, Adhi <br />Shankara did it, it is more powerful. </p>

        <p>Dear <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RC</acronym ,</p>
<p>Excellent information.... ivvalavu vishayam irukka <br />srichakrathukulla???</p>
<p>but what is the significance of the form of the chakram??? i mean <br />the shape?? how does it benefit and concentrate all energies???</p>
<p>any similarity between pyramids and srichakram for i find both have <br />lot of triangles...</p>
<p>there is a place in North karnataka called Hubli which many of us <br />are familiar... one striking thing is that many road junctions would <br />be in the form of triangle in that place.. i do not know why and <br />would there be any impact of that on the functioning and prosperity <br />of the town??</p>

<blockquote><p>  There are Mantra rajam, Yantra rajam and Tantra rajam, for <br />Srividhya <br />  upasana marga.</p>
<p>  Panchadasi is said to be Mantrarajam (many say Shodashi), and <br />  Srichakra as Yantrarajam.</p>
<p>  Though Adhi Shankarar was Shanmathasthaapakar, there are many, <br />  including myself, who believe he is a Shaktha. There are reasons <br />for <br />  this. There is a story that he first chose Srilalitha Sahasranam <br />for <br />  Bhashya and Godess herself gave him Vishnu Sahasranam for that <br />  purpose, and told him, that, she has chosen someone else for that <br />  purpose. He name is Baskarayar. He migrated from north to south <br />and <br />  stayed near Kumbakonam. There is a place called Baskararayapuram.</p>
<p>  Srichakram, as Venkat said, has predominant nine triangles, and <br />  which is vital for Nava Avarana Puja. And it is very auspicious to <br />  perform this puja on a Full Moon day. Especially during Chitra <br />  Pournami.</p>
<p>  These yantras has tendency to full fill wishes. Adhi Shankara, is <br />  said to have installed Dhana Aakarshana Yantra, at Thirupathi. But <br />  many say it was Suka Brahmar, the son of Veda Vyasa, who has done <br />  it. But, the effect is very much visible.</p>
<p>  Srichakra, is gaurded on four gates by Ashtamaasiddhi, one on each <br />  side of the gate. These siddhis are Anima,Mahima, Lagima, Garima, <br />  Eshithva, Vashitva, prapti, and pragamya.</p>
<p>  Actually a Shri Chakra has all the gods and goddess in it. There <br />are <br />  text, that sayd it is Shiva Chakra, if it is placed upside down. <br />So, <br />  Shiva-Shakthi aikyam. She is Shiva-Shakthi Aikya roopini as per <br />  Srilalitha Sahasranama.</p>
<p>  Srichakra is the abode of Shiva-shakthi, Vishnu-lakshmi, brahma-<br />  Vani, and many other innumerable goddess. She is said to be served <br />  to 64 Crore yoginis. Infact, there are group of Brahmins, who <br />  challenged Baskararayar on this name. And Baskararayar, worshipped <br />  goddess and she sat as a Parrot (Brahmasuki) on his shoulders, <br />  ivisible to others. She started saying the names and <br />characterestic <br />  of 64 crore yoginis and those group worshipped him and accepted <br />the <br />  defeat. She is 'Chathushati Koti Yogini Parisevidha'.</p>
<p>  I will write soon more on Srichakram. There may be many members, <br />who <br />  might know vast and more information. And they can enlighten you <br />  more.</p>

<p>    i was amazed when i saw srichakram for the firs time in sivakami <br />    amman koil... but later when i started visiting various temples <br />  like <br />    kamakshi temple ,tiruvotriyur , margabandhu temple at <br />  virinchipuram <br />    and others, i saw srichakrams installed in all places</p>
<p>    invariably by adisankarar... what is the significance of <br />  installing <br />    srichakram in amman temples and why was adisankara so hell bent <br />on <br />    installing the same</p>
<p>    even though there are chakram's for each god like pillaiyar, <br />  murugan <br />    and sivan, why is srichakram given so much importance and why <br />are <br />    the other chakrams not so prevalent as srichakram???</p>

<p>        Srichakram is the yantra of Devi Lalitha Parameshwari. It is <br />  in <br />      line <br />        with Panchadasakshari Mantra, Sriguru, Lalitha and, Sadhaka. <br />        Srividhyoupasakas worships, this Yantra as Devi herself.</p>
<p>        Sloka 11 of Soudarya Lahari and, Sloka 'Srichakram Shruthi <br />        mulakosha..' of Shakthi Mahimana sthotram will eloborate on <br />        Srichakra.</p>
<p>        There needs to be a clean heart and external cleanliness for <br />    this <br />        worship. Mostly done by people who have been given a <br />Dheekdha <br />  to <br />        Shrivishya Upaasana marga. It is the source of entire <br />universe <br />    or <br />        belived to be.</p>
<p>        It is the top view of Maha Meru, which can be seen in Devi <br />    temples <br />        eg. Saratha temple near Meenakshi College, and Agathiyar <br />  temple <br />      near <br />        pondy bazzar in T.Nagar.</p>
<p>        It acted as a chariot for Devi, on her war against <br />        Bandaura, 'Shrichakra rahta rooda'</p>
