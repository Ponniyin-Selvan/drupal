</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi <br />I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>(incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

        <p>This again takes us back to the thought of Bala. Bala is very unique, it issaid to be the energy force of all the deities we pray.</p>
<p>Bala is primarily attributed to Maha Vishnu's power(shakti) as the athi devetha.</p>
<p>Bala is beyond any sex as God itself ism hence portrayed in a child like form.</p>
<p>Bala is often taken as a small lady (hence ambal), Bala can also classify as Bala Kumaran (Krishna or Muruga - both are bala kumarans). Bala is also our own Bala'Ji'.</p>
<p>Being Bala, that force is also a part of the budhist belief (has to be being the force of any deity).</p>
<p>I am convinced that the cosmic force there is of Maha Vishnu or Adi bagawanin which ever name you want to call it.</p>

But one of my uncles says that it is neither Balaji nor Murugan but only Ambal! Ambal's face?iscovered up with lot of decorations including the Thirunamam !?

<p>  Muruga is actually the combined unit of Narayana and Sankara-Shakti in reality, it is said as Siva Balan Udithanan not pirandhan.</p>
<p>  Our favourite Perumal has the uncanny way of giving darshan to all his devotees as they want to see him in the deepest of their minds. Every time I see him, I can only visualize Varaha murthy not even my own Lord Muruga...No wonder some one says he is Budha :) </p>

<p>      Here is another hat in the ring :)</p>
<p>      I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency to grant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by theLord.</p>
<p>      More:</p>
<p>      Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>      Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the Lord IS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>      I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman.I hope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>      Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, itis a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirror reflection of each other. </p>

<p>        Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>        I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>        You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much.In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than thatof Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>        Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRaivEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>e was a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?ofthe Deity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>        The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?IlangoAdigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the linkgiven by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>

<p>        but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />        how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>

        <p>Hi Friend:<br />?<br />Do you know that there is a version that "Tirupathi Balaji" is not really avaishnavite temple? but the original deity is only?Murugan.? And that is why Tamil Leaders like the late?Ma Po Sivagnanam and others?were ferocisouly fighting with the Govt of India to retain Tirupati and Tiruttaniwith Tamilnadu when state boundaries were redrawn after Independence. <br />?<br />It is said that centuries back, when the saivite and vaishnavite war was going on, to retain Tirupathi as a vaishnavite shrine, some secret plans were?made to show that the original deity is Balaji and that is why?a big?Thirunamam was put up? to cover up his face!? But one of my uncles says that it is neither Balaji nor Murugan but only Ambal! Ambal's face?iscovered up with lot of decorations including the Thirunamam !? He tells me that many years back, on a very rare occasion, alongwith friends he had the opportunity to take darshan of the deity when?all the abhishekams were performed and at that time they were able to find out the truth!? Now you can't even stand a few seconds near the sanctum sanctorum which is?another story!??<br />?<br /><a href="mailto:veegopalji@yahoo.com">veegopalji@yahoo.com</a></p>

<p>Muruga is actually the combined unit of Narayana and Sankara-Shakti in reality, it is said as Siva Balan Udithanan not pirandhan.</p>
<p>Our favourite Perumal has the uncanny way of giving darshan to all his devotees as they want to see him in the deepest of their minds. Every time I see him, I can only visualize Varaha murthy not even my own Lord Muruga...No wonder some one says he is Budha :) </p>
<p>- R<br />PS: Long hair of the Lord may be considered as a feminine attribute, however I think otherwise.</p>

<p>    I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency togrant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by the Lord.</p>
<p>    More:</p>
<p>    Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>    Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the LordIS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>    I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman. Ihope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>    Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, it is a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirrorreflection of each other. </p>

<p>      (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

<p>    Ravi, very well put and very nice interpretation of Balaji.</p>
<p>    The original idol is only a few feet tall than the 'dressed up version'...Tirupathi is a multi billion dollar business, long ceased to be a spiritual place. Less the said of it the better. The most recent is fingeprintingof devotees for darshan. Regarding the 'actual nature' stories abound, Variyar actually made claims it was Murugan and the namam was put to hide thiruneeru and all that. </p>
<p>    There is no harm at all investigating the history of the temple and thedeity but sometimes we hindus are obsessed/very posessive that it is 'our deity'. Kannano kandano buddhano kankanda deivam, podadha?</p>

<p>      I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency to grant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by theLord.</p>
<p>      More:</p>
<p>      Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>      Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the Lord IS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>      I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman.I hope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>      Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, itis a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirror reflection of each other.  </p>
<p>      PS: There are theories on the fixing of weapons to the Lord, but fromwhat I learnt, the Large Namam that covers the eyes is very much newer. I hope some one would clarify / explain.<br />      Also, the original lord is only a few feet rather than the large dressed up version. </p>

<p>        <Quote <br />        Lakshmi recognized as consort of Vishnu, only since Alvandar's time <br />        This discussion should be sufficient to show that the devise of Lakshmi was in Buddhist traditions and that the image of Lakshmi found on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai does not exclude it from being considered as Buddhist image. At the same time mere presence of Lakshmi on the chest of thisidol does not prove it that the idol is that of Vishnu. <br />        We have already seen in Chapter 10 that even after Her acceptance as a consort of Vishnu, Lakshmi was depicted only with the Sheshashyai form and not with the standing form. <br />        However, we have to consider the time when Lakshmi got accepted as a consort of Vishnu. It was Alvander, who for the first time propagated Lakshmi as consort of Vishnu in South India. [Raghavacharya: I,150] <br />        This raises another question. If Lakshmi was not considered as the consort of Vishnu as late as the time of Alvander, (918- 1038 A.D.) then how do you account for Her presence on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai? Surelythe image was earlier than this period. This is discussed in next chapter. <br />        <Unquote </p>
<p>        This proves to a greater extent what I said in my last sentence?below, about the motive of the author. The author (Jamnadas) apparently is not doing a neutral study. He has preset?objectives of having to establishthat Thirumala is Buddhist. Now he is in search for some lines which he can possibly claim to be to his advantage. There are a lot of blasphemies, but I will list very few and explain the inconsistencies.<br />        ?<br />        Here he says that associating Lakshmi?to Vishnu is only from Alavandar's time. Good. I dont know where he gets this from. Even Nammazhwar sings:<br />        ?<br />        "agalagillEn iRaiyumenRu alarmEl mangai uRai mArbA........ niga-il amarar munik kaNangaL virumbum thiruvEngadatthAnE...."<br />        ?<br />        "alarmEl mangai" is a term used only for Lakshmi and Nammazhwar certainly precedes Alavandar. </p>
<p>        I take this one to just let know that the motive of the author is vested and hence we cannot see any reality or neutrality in his claim.<br />        ?<br />        Another one</p>
<p>        <Quote <br />        If we accept this statement we have to bring back the date of fixing of weapons to the murthi of Lord of Tirumalai to Silappadhikaran's time. We have seen that Tirumalsai Alvar who is said to have been about a centuryearlier than Silappadhikaran, [Raghavacharya: II:1008] does not mention any weapons. So we have to consider the time of fixing the weapons about 7th to 8th century, instead of Ramanuja's time <br />        <Unquote </p>
<p>        Based on the above concept, Buddhism is to have originated only because a Siddhartha, got enlightenment regarding letting go of the desires toget rid of the sorrow in this world. Until then he was a normal Kshatriya. </p>
<p>        Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhist claims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence. So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />        ?<br />        And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>
<p>        Very Important Quote from Jamnadas<br />        <Quote <br />        In any case, the evidence of Alvars is useless in any dispute wherea Buddhist claim is involved, because Alvars were quite hostile to Buddhists, as will be seen in next chapter<br />        <Unquote </p>
<p>        Having quote the above from Jamnadas I invite you all to the first page of his book<br />        <Quote <br />        Dedication</quote></p>

<p>        By his own logic, he proves what I stated in my earlier mail about his own motive and vested interest. Just in the same way as Jamnadas cannotaccept Azhwars' claims as they were hostile to Buddhism, needless to say if the above quoted personality Loved or Hated Hinduism.

<p>        Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>        I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>        You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much.In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than thatof Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>        Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRaivEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>e was a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?ofthe Deity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>        The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?IlangoAdigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the linkgiven by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>
<p>        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh<br />        ?</p>

<p>        Hi <br />        I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area andthen this doubt came up.</p>
<p>        of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />        vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>        we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>

<p>            Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>            I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, dueto the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>            You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that of Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>            Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl orThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>there was a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of the Deity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and somewho say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>            The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link given by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeedhave clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>

<p>            Hi <br />            I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its areaand then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>            of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />            vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>            we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whtherthirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>            but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />            how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>            (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

<p>        I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out ofrespect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency to grant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by the Lord.</p>
<p>        More:</p>
<p>        Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>        Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the Lord IS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>        I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman. I hope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>        Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, it is a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirror reflection of each other.  </p>

<p>ere was a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recenttimes?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of the Deity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>          The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalaiis indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link given by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>

<p>          Hi <br />          I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>          of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />          vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>          we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>          but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />          how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>          (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>rown fashioned out of his long locks of hair - Jata makuta. Vishnu is shownwearing a ornamented crown - Karandmakuta. However, there is an exception to this. In the shore temple, the jala /sthala sayana perumal ( the one with the broken hand - it had been broken during mahendra time, and as per hiscourt poet of some time - Acharya Dandin in one of works comments thus - the pallava sculptors were such expert craftsmen that they repaired the image so perfectly - again leads us to some questions - the two shiva shrines sandwiching the vishnu shrine in mallai are rajasimha structures - but Dandin says thus</p>
<p>MAHAMALLAPURE Devaha Swairam VaridhiSanidhya Ashte MUKUNDHA Sanandham Farindhra Ivam MANDIRE</p>
<p>Anyway back to subject, this sayana perumal is depicted with Jatamakuta. Swaminathan sir commented - maybe the sculptor realistically depicted him - normally you would remove your crown while you rest/ sleep</p>

        <p>Long hair is not in the least 'feminine' by those days - Rama and Krishna had long hair and so did most pauranical charactersn.Valmiki describes in detail how Sri Rama's beautiful long hair was braided into locks during exile, Arjuna's long hair was supposedly one of his most handsome features!! Most warriors and kings had atleast shoulder length hair - if you look at paintings and sculptures. The modern male hair cut is truly a latter day western concept that came in later. Even in the west Jesus supposedly had long hair and so do most men in Michael Angelo's paintings.</p>

<p>      Here is another hat in the ring :)</p>
<p>      I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency to grant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by theLord.</p>
<p>      More:</p>
<p>      Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>      Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the Lord IS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>      I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman.I hope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>      Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, itis a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirror reflection of each other.  </p>
<p>      PS: There are theories on the fixing of weapons to the Lord, but fromwhat I learnt, the Large Namam that covers the eyes is very much newer. I hope some one would clarify / explain.<br />      Also, the original lord is only a few feet rather than the large dressed up version. </p>

<p>        <Quote <br />        Lakshmi recognized as consort of Vishnu, only since Alvandar's time <br />        This discussion should be sufficient to show that the devise of Lakshmi was in Buddhist traditions and that the image of Lakshmi found on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai does not exclude it from being considered as Buddhist image. At the same time mere presence of Lakshmi on the chest of thisidol does not prove it that the idol is that of Vishnu. <br />        We have already seen in Chapter 10 that even after Her acceptance as a consort of Vishnu, Lakshmi was depicted only with the Sheshashyai form and not with the standing form. <br />        However, we have to consider the time when Lakshmi got accepted as a consort of Vishnu. It was Alvander, who for the first time propagated Lakshmi as consort of Vishnu in South India. [Raghavacharya: I,150] <br />        This raises another question. If Lakshmi was not considered as the consort of Vishnu as late as the time of Alvander, (918- 1038 A.D.) then how do you account for Her presence on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai? Surelythe image was earlier than this period. This is discussed in next chapter. <br />        <Unquote </p>
<p>        This proves to a greater extent what I said in my last sentence?below, about the motive of the author. The author (Jamnadas) apparently is not doing a neutral study. He has preset?objectives of having to establishthat Thirumala is Buddhist. Now he is in search for some lines which he can possibly claim to be to his advantage. There are a lot of blasphemies, but I will list very few and explain the inconsistencies.<br />        ?<br />        Here he says that associating Lakshmi?to Vishnu is only from Alavandar's time. Good. I dont know where he gets this from. Even Nammazhwar sings:<br />        ?<br />        "agalagillEn iRaiyumenRu alarmEl mangai uRai mArbA........ niga-il amarar munik kaNangaL virumbum thiruvEngadatthAnE...."<br />        ?<br />        "alarmEl mangai" is a term used only for Lakshmi and Nammazhwar certainly precedes Alavandar. </p>
<p>        I take this one to just let know that the motive of the author is vested and hence we cannot see any reality or neutrality in his claim.<br />        ?<br />        Another one</p>
<p>        <Quote <br />        If we accept this statement we have to bring back the date of fixing of weapons to the murthi of Lord of Tirumalai to Silappadhikaran's time. We have seen that Tirumalsai Alvar who is said to have been about a centuryearlier than Silappadhikaran, [Raghavacharya: II:1008] does not mention any weapons. So we have to consider the time of fixing the weapons about 7th to 8th century, instead of Ramanuja's time <br />        <Unquote </p>
<p>        Based on the above concept, Buddhism is to have originated only because a Siddhartha, got enlightenment regarding letting go of the desires toget rid of the sorrow in this world. Until then he was a normal Kshatriya. </p>
<p>        Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhist claims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence. So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />        ?<br />        And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>
<p>        Very Important Quote from Jamnadas<br />        <Quote <br />        In any case, the evidence of Alvars is useless in any dispute wherea Buddhist claim is involved, because Alvars were quite hostile to Buddhists, as will be seen in next chapter<br />        <Unquote </p>
<p>        Having quote the above from Jamnadas I invite you all to the first page of his book<br />        <Quote <br />        Dedication</quote></p>

<p>        By his own logic, he proves what I stated in my earlier mail about his own motive and vested interest.

<p>        Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>        I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>        You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much.In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than thatof Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>        Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRaivEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>e was a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?ofthe Deity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>        The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?IlangoAdigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the linkgiven by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>

        <p>Ravi, am not disputing at all the spiiritual power of the place - am a great devotee myself. And nothing at all to do with any individuals misusing their wealth either.</p>
<p>I am talking of the out and out commercialisation of the temple, which is not limited to Tirupathi of course but Tirupathi leads the lot in that regard. The laddu prasad is actually not a prasad at all, never offered to the Lord. It is just a condiment made to boost sales and revenue to the temple.The darshan is a bare glimpse, even if you pay for it. Even the early morning seva has been advanced to 3-4 am while aagama vidhis say sunrise or ushadkala should be the right time.</p>
<p>I was trying to book for seva ahead of time from US and heard now they wantfingerprints to make sure person booked is actaully going!!<br />How far does this go?</p>
<p>The magnetic power of the Lord while continue to draw millions of devotees but it is high time someone started paying attention to the commercialisation and how far they are going to take it.</p>

<p>      I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency to grant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy.

<p>      Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>      Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the Lord IS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>      I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman.I hope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>      Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, itis a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirror reflection of each other.  </p>

<p>        <Quote <br />        Lakshmi recognized as consort of Vishnu, only since Alvandar's time <br />        This discussion should be sufficient to show that the devise of Lakshmi was in Buddhist traditions and that the image of Lakshmi found on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai does not exclude it from being considered as Buddhist image. At the same time mere presence of Lakshmi on the chest of thisidol does not prove it that the idol is that of Vishnu. <br />        We have already seen in Chapter 10 that even after Her acceptance as a consort of Vishnu, Lakshmi was depicted only with the Sheshashyai form and not with the standing form. <br />        However, we have to consider the time when Lakshmi got accepted as a consort of Vishnu. It was Alvander, who for the first time propagated Lakshmi as consort of Vishnu in South India. [Raghavacharya: I,150] <br />        This raises another question. If Lakshmi was not considered as the consort of Vishnu as late as the time of Alvander, (918- 1038 A.D.) then how do you account for Her presence on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai? Surelythe image was earlier than this period. This is discussed in next chapter. <br />        <Unquote </p>
<p>        This proves to a greater extent what I said in my last sentence?below, about the motive of the author. The author (Jamnadas) apparently is not doing a neutral study. He has preset?objectives of having to establishthat Thirumala is Buddhist. Now he is in search for some lines which he can possibly claim to be to his advantage. There are a lot of blasphemies, but I will list very few and explain the inconsistencies.<br />        ?<br />        Here he says that associating Lakshmi?to Vishnu is only from Alavandar's time. Good. I dont know where he gets this from. Even Nammazhwar sings:<br />        ?<br />        "agalagillEn iRaiyumenRu alarmEl mangai uRai mArbA........ niga-il amarar munik kaNangaL virumbum thiruvEngadatthAnE...."<br />        ?<br />        "alarmEl mangai" is a term used only for Lakshmi and Nammazhwar certainly precedes Alavandar. </p>
<p>        I take this one to just let know that the motive of the author is vested and hence we cannot see any reality or neutrality in his claim.<br />        ?<br />        Another one</p>
<p>        <Quote <br />        If we accept this statement we have to bring back the date of fixing of weapons to the murthi of Lord of Tirumalai to Silappadhikaran's time. We have seen that Tirumalsai Alvar who is said to have been about a centuryearlier than Silappadhikaran, [Raghavacharya: II:1008] does not mention any weapons. So we have to consider the time of fixing the weapons about 7th to 8th century, instead of Ramanuja's time <br />        <Unquote </p>
<p>        Based on the above concept, Buddhism is to have originated only because a Siddhartha, got enlightenment regarding letting go of the desires toget rid of the sorrow in this world. Until then he was a normal Kshatriya. </p>
<p>        Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhist claims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence. So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />        ?<br />        And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>
<p>        Very Important Quote from Jamnadas<br />        <Quote <br />        In any case, the evidence of Alvars is useless in any dispute wherea Buddhist claim is involved, because Alvars were quite hostile to Buddhists, as will be seen in next chapter<br />        <Unquote </p>
<p>        Having quote the above from Jamnadas I invite you all to the first page of his book<br />        <Quote <br />        Dedication</quote></p>

<p>        By his own logic, he proves what I stated in my earlier mail about his own motive and vested interest. Just in the same way as Jamnadas cannotaccept Azhwars' claims as they were hostile to Buddhism, needless to say if the above quoted personality Loved or Hated Hinduism. What else can we get to read from a person claiming to be shown the path by the most voraciousHindu Hater?<br />        ?<br />        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh</p>

<p>        Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>        I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>        You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much.In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than thatof Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>        Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRaivEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>e was a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?ofthe Deity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>        The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?IlangoAdigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the linkgiven by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>
<p>        Regards,<br />        Venkatesh<br />        ?</p>

<p>        Hi <br />        I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area andthen this doubt came up.</p>
<p>        of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />        vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>        we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>        but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />        how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>        (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

<p>      This proves to a greater extent what I said in my last sentence?below, about the motive of the author. The author (Jamnadas) apparently is notdoing a neutral study. He has preset?objectives of having to establish that Thirumala is Buddhist. Now he is in search for some lines which he can possibly claim to be to his advantage. There are a lot of blasphemies, but I will list very few and explain the inconsistencies.<br />      ?<br />      Here he says that associating Lakshmi?to Vishnu is only from Alavandar's time. Good. I dont know where he gets this from. Even Nammazhwar sings:<br />      ?<br />      "agalagillEn iRaiyumenRu alarmEl mangai uRai mArbA........ niga-il amarar munik kaNangaL virumbum thiruvEngadatthAnE...."<br />      ?<br />      "alarmEl mangai" is a term used only for Lakshmi and Nammazhwar certainly precedes Alavandar. </p>
<p>      I take this one to just let know that the motive of the author is vested and hence we cannot see any reality or neutrality in his claim.<br />      ?<br />      Another one</p>
<p>      <Quote <br />      If we accept this statement we have to bring back the date of fixing of weapons to the murthi of Lord of Tirumalai to Silappadhikaran's time. Wehave seen that Tirumalsai Alvar who is said to have been about a century earlier than Silappadhikaran, [Raghavacharya: II:1008] does not mention any weapons. So we have to consider the time of fixing the weapons about 7th to8th century, instead of Ramanuja's time <br />      <Unquote </p>
<p>      Based on the above concept, Buddhism is to have originated only because a Siddhartha, got enlightenment regarding letting go of the desires to get rid of the sorrow in this world. Until then he was a normal Kshatriya. </p>
<p>      Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhist claims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence. So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />      ?<br />      And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>
<p>      Very Important Quote from Jamnadas<br />      <Quote <br />      In any case, the evidence of Alvars is useless in any dispute where aBuddhist claim is involved, because Alvars were quite hostile to Buddhists, as will be seen in next chapter<br />      <Unquote </p>

<p>      Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>      I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>      You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that of Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>      Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>was a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of the Deity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to restall the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>      The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link given by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>
<p>      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh<br />      ?</p>

<p>      Hi <br />      I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>      of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />      vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>      we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>      but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />      how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>      (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

        <p>Muruga is actually the combined unit of Narayana and Sankara-Shakti in reality, it is said as Siva Balan Udithanan not pirandhan.</p>
<p>Our favourite Perumal has the uncanny way of giving darshan to all his devotees as they want to see him in the deepest of their minds. Every time I see him, I can only visualize Varaha murthy not even my own Lord Muruga...No wonder some one says he is Budha :) </p>

<p>    I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency togrant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by the Lord.</p>
<p>    More:</p>
<p>    Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>    Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the LordIS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>    I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman. Ihope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>    Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, it is a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirrorreflection of each other.  </p>
<p>    PS: There are theories on the fixing of weapons to the Lord, but from what I learnt, the Large Namam that covers the eyes is very much newer. I hope some one would clarify / explain.<br />    Also, the original lord is only a few feet rather than the large dressed up version. </p>

<p>  I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency to grant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by the Lord.</p>
<p>  More:</p>
<p>  Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>  Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the Lord IS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>  I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman. I hope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>  Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, it is a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirror reflection of each other.  </p>

<p>    <Quote <br />    Lakshmi recognized as consort of Vishnu, only since Alvandar's time <br />    This discussion should be sufficient to show that the devise of Lakshmiwas in Buddhist traditions and that the image of Lakshmi found on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai does not exclude it from being considered as Buddhist image. At the same time mere presence of Lakshmi on the chest of this idol does not prove it that the idol is that of Vishnu. <br />    We have already seen in Chapter 10 that even after Her acceptance as a consort of Vishnu, Lakshmi was depicted only with the Sheshashyai form and not with the standing form. <br />    However, we have to consider the time when Lakshmi got accepted as a consort of Vishnu. It was Alvander, who for the first time propagated Lakshmias consort of Vishnu in South India. [Raghavacharya: I,150] <br />    This raises another question. If Lakshmi was not considered as the consort of Vishnu as late as the time of Alvander, (918- 1038 A.D.) then how doyou account for Her presence on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai? Surely theimage was earlier than this period. This is discussed in next chapter. <br />    <Unquote </p>
<p>    This proves to a greater extent what I said in my last sentence?below, about the motive of the author. The author (Jamnadas) apparently is not doing a neutral study. He has preset?objectives of having to establish that Thirumala is Buddhist. Now he is in search for some lines which he can possibly claim to be to his advantage. There are a lot of blasphemies, but I will list very few and explain the inconsistencies.<br />    ?<br />    Here he says that associating Lakshmi?to Vishnu is only from Alavandar's time. Good. I dont know where he gets this from. Even Nammazhwar sings:<br />    ?<br />    "agalagillEn iRaiyumenRu alarmEl mangai uRai mArbA........ niga-il amarar munik kaNangaL virumbum thiruvEngadatthAnE...."<br />    ?<br />    "alarmEl mangai" is a term used only for Lakshmi and Nammazhwar certainly precedes Alavandar. </p>
<p>    I take this one to just let know that the motive of the author is vested and hence we cannot see any reality or neutrality in his claim.<br />    ?<br />    Another one</p>
<p>    <Quote <br />    If we accept this statement we have to bring back the date of fixing ofweapons to the murthi of Lord of Tirumalai to Silappadhikaran's time. We have seen that Tirumalsai Alvar who is said to have been about a century earlier than Silappadhikaran, [Raghavacharya: II:1008] does not mention any weapons. So we have to consider the time of fixing the weapons about 7th to 8th century, instead of Ramanuja's time <br />    <Unquote </p>
<p>    Based on the above concept, Buddhism is to have originated only becausea Siddhartha, got enlightenment regarding letting go of the desires to getrid of the sorrow in this world. Until then he was a normal Kshatriya. </p>
<p>    Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhistclaims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence. So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />    ?<br />    And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>
<p>    Very Important Quote from Jamnadas<br />    <Quote <br />    In any case, the evidence of Alvars is useless in any dispute where a Buddhist claim is involved, because Alvars were quite hostile to Buddhists, as will be seen in next chapter<br />    <Unquote </p>

<p>    Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>    I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>    You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that ofSrirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>    Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>s a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of theDeity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>    The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link given by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>

<p>    Hi <br />    I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>    of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />    vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>    we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>    but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />    how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>    (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

        <p>It is sure complicated how the messages are conveyed, <br />Both Valli and Deva Kunjari are Lakshmi's forms. <br />But it is no secret that they both reside in the heart of the Lord and cannot be separated from him.<br />If they are Lakshmi and they reside in him, that makes the two factions one, which I am not yet ready to stir another nest.<br />More:<br />Each consort holds a Thamarai and an Alli on their hands (Similar traits from Malayappa swamy and others). <br />There are so many such traits, Sudarshana submerged into the Lord during the war with Tarakasura and that can happen to only one. </p>
<p>I believe from a granular level the only path to salvation is to take one God and believe in him to deliver, hence the Nayanmar or Alwars had followedone path, I personally dont think there is any difference between any of the Lord almighty.</p>
<p>Thats what makes Tirupati so special, have we not thought of any Lord and the Master at Tirupati shows that person to us ?</p>
<p>- R<br />PS: The Namam is pachai karpuram and it has magnetic tendencies towards shalagramam. I have some hearsay that the first Namam was a glob of Pachai karpuram that got stuck on the face and it was shaped to be a Namam.No namam should ever cover the eyes of the Lord.</p>

<p>      Hi <br />      I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>      of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />      vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>      we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>      but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />      how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>      (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

If Lakshmi was not considered as the consort of Vishnu as late as the time of Alvander, (918- 1038 A.D.) then how doyou account for Her presence on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai?

<p>    This proves to a greater extent what I said in my last sentence?below, about the motive of the author. The author (Jamnadas) apparently is not doing a neutral study.

There are a lot of blasphemies, but I will list very few and explain the inconsistencies.<br />    ?<br />    Here he says that associating Lakshmi?to Vishnu is only from Alavandar's time. Good. I dont know where he gets this from.

<p>    I take this one to just let know that the motive of the author is vested and hence we cannot see any reality or neutrality in his claim.<br />    ?<br />    Another one</p>
<p>    <Quote <br />    If we accept this statement we have to bring back the date of fixing ofweapons to the murthi of Lord of Tirumalai to Silappadhikaran's time. We have seen that Tirumalsai Alvar who is said to have been about a century earlier than Silappadhikaran, [Raghavacharya: II:1008] does not mention any weapons. So we have to consider the time of fixing the weapons about 7th to 8th century, instead of Ramanuja's time <br />    <Unquote </p>
<p>    Based on the above concept, Buddhism is to have originated only becausea Siddhartha, got enlightenment regarding letting go of the desires to getrid of the sorrow in this world. Until then he was a normal Kshatriya. </p>
<p>    Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhistclaims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence. So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />    ?<br />    And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>
<p>    Very Important Quote from Jamnadas<br />    <Quote <br />    In any case, the evidence of Alvars is useless in any dispute where a Buddhist claim is involved, because Alvars were quite hostile to Buddhists, as will be seen in next chapter<br />    <Unquote </p>

<p>    Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>    I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>    You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that ofSrirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>    Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>s a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of theDeity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>    The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link given by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>

<p>.Tirupathi is a multi billion dollar business, long ceased to be a spiritual place. Less the said of it the better. The most recent is fingeprinting of devotees for darshan.

<p>    I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency togrant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by the Lord.</p>

<p>    Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>    Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the LordIS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>    I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman. Ihope to compile them soon enough. </p>

Just in the same way as Jamnadas cannot accept Azhwars' claims as they were hostile to Buddhism, needless to say if the above quoted personality Loved or Hated Hinduism.

<p>      Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>      I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>      You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that of Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>      Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>was a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of the Deity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to restall the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>      The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link given by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>
<p>      Regards,<br />      Venkatesh<br />      ?</p>

<p>      Hi <br />      I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>      of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />      vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>      we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>      but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />      how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>      (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

        <p>Ravi, very well put and very nice interpretation of Balaji.</p>
<p>The original idol is only a few feet tall than the 'dressed up version'...Tirupathi is a multi billion dollar business, long ceased to be a spiritual place. Less the said of it the better. The most recent is fingeprinting of devotees for darshan. Regarding the 'actual nature' stories abound, Variyaractually made claims it was Murugan and the namam was put to hide thiruneeru and all that. </p>
<p>There is no harm at all investigating the history of the temple and the deity but sometimes we hindus are obsessed/very posessive that it is 'our deity'. Kannano kandano buddhano kankanda deivam, podadha?</p>

<p>  I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency to grant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by the Lord.</p>
<p>  More:</p>
<p>  Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>  Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the Lord IS, that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>  I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman. I hope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>  Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, it is a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirror reflection of each other.  </p>
<p>  PS: There are theories on the fixing of weapons to the Lord, but from what I learnt, the Large Namam that covers the eyes is very much newer. I hopesome one would clarify / explain.<br />  Also, the original lord is only a few feet rather than the large dressed up version. </p>

<p>    I did read the chapters 16 to 20?quickly. Here?is something. Oru paanai sORRukku oru sORu padham.<br />    ?<br />    Take This.?Jamnadas says </p>
<p>    <Quote <br />    Lakshmi recognized as consort of Vishnu, only since Alvandar's time <br />    This discussion should be sufficient to show that the devise of Lakshmiwas in Buddhist traditions and that the image of Lakshmi found on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai does not exclude it from being considered as Buddhist image. At the same time mere presence of Lakshmi on the chest of this idol does not prove it that the idol is that of Vishnu. <br />    We have already seen in Chapter 10 that even after Her acceptance as a consort of Vishnu, Lakshmi was depicted only with the Sheshashyai form and not with the standing form. <br />    However, we have to consider the time when Lakshmi got accepted as a consort of Vishnu. It was Alvander, who for the first time propagated Lakshmias consort of Vishnu in South India. [Raghavacharya: I,150] <br />    This raises another question. If Lakshmi was not considered as the consort of Vishnu as late as the time of Alvander, (918- 1038 A.D.) then how doyou account for Her presence on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai? Surely theimage was earlier than this period. This is discussed in next chapter. <br />    <Unquote </p>
<p>    This proves to a greater extent what I said in my last sentence?below, about the motive of the author. The author (Jamnadas) apparently is not doing a neutral study. He has preset?objectives of having to establish that Thirumala is Buddhist. Now he is in search for some lines which he can possibly claim to be to his advantage. There are a lot of blasphemies, but I will list very few and explain the inconsistencies.<br />    ?<br />    Here he says that associating Lakshmi?to Vishnu is only from Alavandar's time. Good. I dont know where he gets this from. Even Nammazhwar sings:<br />    ?<br />    "agalagillEn iRaiyumenRu alarmEl mangai uRai mArbA........ niga-il amarar munik kaNangaL virumbum thiruvEngadatthAnE...."<br />    ?<br />    "alarmEl mangai" is a term used only for Lakshmi and Nammazhwar certainly precedes Alavandar. </p>
<p>    I take this one to just let know that the motive of the author is vested and hence we cannot see any reality or neutrality in his claim.<br />    ?<br />    Another one</p>
<p>    <Quote <br />    If we accept this statement we have to bring back the date of fixing ofweapons to the murthi of Lord of Tirumalai to Silappadhikaran's time. We have seen that Tirumalsai Alvar who is said to have been about a century earlier than Silappadhikaran, [Raghavacharya: II:1008] does not mention any weapons. So we have to consider the time of fixing the weapons about 7th to 8th century, instead of Ramanuja's time <br />    <Unquote </p>
<p>    Based on the above concept, Buddhism is to have originated only becausea Siddhartha, got enlightenment regarding letting go of the desires to getrid of the sorrow in this world. Until then he was a normal Kshatriya. </p>
<p>    Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhistclaims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence. So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />    ?<br />    And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>
<p>    Very Important Quote from Jamnadas<br />    <Quote <br />    In any case, the evidence of Alvars is useless in any dispute where a Buddhist claim is involved, because Alvars were quite hostile to Buddhists, as will be seen in next chapter<br />    <Unquote </p>

<p>  EVR -?The less said about him the better, as it?would?go to the extent of?inviting some unwanted exchanges in this harmonious group. But I?can say that his?intentions are not as straightforward as one may think. Again?'Oru Paanai?Sotrukku Oru Soru?Padham". In?one of?his articles he criticizes Thondar-adip-podi Azhwar for his pAsuram in which he says?(from a normal outlook) that he would cut off the heads of the Jains and Buddhists who spread?false news about his beloved deity. Fine. But whydid he fail to notice in other 4 pAsurams in which?he (Thondar-adip-podiAzhwar) pulls?down the caste discrimination. He?goes to say that 1) what ever be the caste of the followers of?Vishnu, as?long as they are?His followers they should not be discriminated. 2)?even if a person is a staunch?Brahmin who does all the rituals in the right way, will become a mean fellow, if he?insults or discriminates between the followers of Vishnu. Similar<br />  thoughts are echoed in 2 or 3 more pAsurams. </p>
<p>  Now just think, EVR could have done?the same thing like a Thondar-adip-podi Azhwar. But he chose to criticize the Brahmins for everything saying that they created this problem, by?hereditarily discriminating in the nameof Caste. But see what his elks are doing now. Are we not starting to see the dynasty politics in vogue now. If in the present day a Doctor's son is a?Doctor and so on, why could things not achieved a pattern, naturally, from a practice which is atleast 3000 years old in history? I am not trying to wash off the bad things that the Brahmins did here. But to blame them squarely is?totally wrong. That is why I say, EVR's struggle in the name of?discrimination, though it had benefitted a few?people, has indeed not created any significant impact for the people in the lower?rungs of the society.</p>

<p>  VV, I have not seen this fully - in the original Jamnadas book I read there was no dedication to EVR. It must have been something added later on by those who did the eversion of this book. Jamnadas was a follower of Ambedkar, who was a Buddhist himself. </p>
<p>  I can understand your viewpoint that his work might be buddhist biased defintiely. It is not in the least as virulent and anti hindu as EVR. Don't know of history of enemity between azhwars but sometimes history does not always favor sentiments. I know about food history and I do know vegetarianism as we practice today has quite a lot of buddhist input. Also we have to give room for the fact that both Ambedkar and EVR fought significant evils in hindu caste system that are impossible to deny.</p>
<p>  All that said - what would you think are the origins of Tirumala? Why is the temple different than other temples? Is it really such a bad thing if it was proven the temple had buddhist origins - both Ezhumalayan and GautamaBuddha are symbols of great mercy and peace to their followers after all?</p>

<p>    I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>    You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that ofSrirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>    Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>s a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of theDeity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>    The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link given by VJ.

<p>    Hi <br />    I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>    of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />    vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>    we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>    but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />    how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>    (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

<p>Avalokiteswara the Budhist lord who is claimed to be the statue at the AdhiVarahaswamy Shrine, does not have any similarities in construction with Lord Venkateswara.</p>
<p>There has been story of forest Goat herders who found the 'weird stone' that would make them behave funny was a few thousand years ago, pretty much before time of Budha.(The stone <acronym title="Archaeology" ARCH </acronym believed to be the crown of adishesha inTirupati is dated to be more than 1000 million years old).</p>

<p>  Now just think, EVR could have done?the same thing like a Thondar-adip-podi Azhwar. But he chose to criticize the Brahmins for everything saying that they created this problem, by?hereditarily discriminating in the nameof Caste. But see what his elks are doing now.

That is why I say, EVR's struggle in the name of?discrimination, though it had benefitted a few?people, has indeed not created any significant impact for the people in the lower?rungs of the society.</p>

<p>    Hi <br />    I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>    of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />    vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>    we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>    but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />    how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>    (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

        <p>Tirupati la irukirathu Murugana - Perumala - ithu oru trick question mathiri.</p>
<p>Here is another hat in the ring :)</p>
<p>I have heard from some acharya's that the Athi Deva in Tirupati is Bala, the eternal youth, even hence the name Bala'ji' (Ji apparently out of respect) also that it is the reason behind the long hair of the Lord. The playful youth form is pure cosmic energy at its maximum and has the tendency to grant what one wishes for 'as per actuals', also called as Venkata ramana Sankata Harana for dissipating the negative energy by equalizing it with the cosmic energy. Many features of child like behavior is exhibited by the Lord.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>Interestingly, Padmavati thayar is mentioned in Skanda purana... </p>
<p>Who the Lord in Tirupati is, may not be the real question, but the Lord IS,that is real and He is of pure cosmic energy as that of the Aadi mulam.</p>
<p>I have found many striking similarities between Muruga and his Maman. I hope to compile them soon enough. </p>
<p>Reading through various Thirupugazh and other documents of Skanda, it is a real effort to decode their relations but it looks so far like a mirror reflection of each other.  </p>
<p>PS: There are theories on the fixing of weapons to the Lord, but from what I learnt, the Large Namam that covers the eyes is very much newer. I hope some one would clarify / explain.<br />Also, the original lord is only a few feet rather than the large dressed upversion. </p>

It was Alvander, who for the first time propagated Lakshmi as consort of Vishnu in South India. [Raghavacharya: I,150] <br />  This raises another question. If Lakshmi was not considered as the consort of Vishnu as late as the time of Alvander, (918- 1038 A.D.) then how do you account for Her presence on the chest of Lord of Tirumalai? Surely the image was earlier than this period. This is discussed in next chapter. <br />  <Unquote </p>
<p>  This proves to a greater extent what I said in my last sentence?below, about the motive of the author. The author (Jamnadas) apparently is not doing a neutral study. He has preset?objectives of having to establish that Thirumala is Buddhist. Now he is in search for some lines which he can possibly claim to be to his advantage. There are a lot of blasphemies, but I will list very few and explain the inconsistencies.<br />  ?<br />  Here he says that associating Lakshmi?to Vishnu is only from Alavandar's time. Good. I dont know where he gets this from. Even Nammazhwar sings:<br />  ?<br />  "agalagillEn iRaiyumenRu alarmEl mangai uRai mArbA........ niga-il amararmunik kaNangaL virumbum thiruvEngadatthAnE...."<br />  ?<br />  "alarmEl mangai" is a term used only for Lakshmi and Nammazhwar certainlyprecedes Alavandar. </p>
<p>  I take this one to just let know that the motive of the author is vested and hence we cannot see any reality or neutrality in his claim.<br />  ?<br />  Another one</p>
<p>  <Quote <br />  If we accept this statement we have to bring back the date of fixing of weapons to the murthi of Lord of Tirumalai to Silappadhikaran's time. We have seen that Tirumalsai Alvar who is said to have been about a century earlier than Silappadhikaran, [Raghavacharya: II:1008] does not mention any weapons. So we have to consider the time of fixing the weapons about 7th to 8thcentury, instead of Ramanuja's time <br />  <Unquote </p>
<p>  Based on the above concept, Buddhism is to have originated only because aSiddhartha, got enlightenment regarding letting go of the desires to get rid of the sorrow in this world. Until then he was a normal Kshatriya. </p>
<p>  Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhist claims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence.So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />  ?<br />  And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>
<p>  Very Important Quote from Jamnadas<br />  <Quote <br />  In any case, the evidence of Alvars is useless in any dispute where a Buddhist claim is involved, because Alvars were quite hostile to Buddhists, aswill be seen in next chapter<br />  <Unquote </p>
<p>  Having quote the above from Jamnadas I invite you all to the first page of his book<br />  <Quote <br />  Dedication</quote></p>

<p>  By his own logic, he proves what I stated in my earlier mail about his own motive and vested interest. Just in the same way as Jamnadas cannot accept Azhwars' claims as they were hostile to Buddhism, needless to say if the above quoted personality Loved or Hated Hinduism. What else can we get to read from a person claiming to be shown the path by the most voracious HinduHater?<br />  ?<br />  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</p>

<p>  Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>  I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>  You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that of Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>  Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl,Vishnu.</p>
<p>a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of theDeity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>  The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link givenby VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?canbe at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>

        <p>Malathi,</p>
<p>If the original does?not contain the dedication, fine. As you?said it could be the later work of the website owners. But as you correctly pointed out, it is indeed a biased work?of a Buddhist.?Rather than biased, it is pre-conceived.</p>
<p>Regarding the Borrowing of Vegetarianism?from Buddhist, our Vairam did?show some?evidences to prove that it could have been from Jains. Whateverbe it, I am starting to believe that there is a truth in this. </p>
<p><Quote <br />Also we have to give room for the fact that both Ambedkar and EVR fought significant evils in hindu caste system that are impossible to deny.<br /><Unquote </p>
<p>EVR -?The less said about him the better, as it?would?go to the extent of?inviting some unwanted exchanges in this harmonious group. But I?can say that his?intentions are not as straightforward as one may think. Again?'Oru Paanai?Sotrukku Oru Soru?Padham". In?one of?his articles he criticizes Thondar-adip-podi Azhwar for his pAsuram in which he says?(from a normal outlook) that he would cut off the heads of the Jains andBuddhists who spread?false news about his beloved deity. Fine. But why did he fail to notice in other 4 pAsurams in which?he (Thondar-adip-podi Azhwar) pulls?down the caste discrimination. He?goes to say that 1) whatever be the caste of the followers of?Vishnu, as?long as they are?His followers they should not be discriminated. 2)?even if a person is a staunch?Brahmin who does all the rituals in the right way, will become a mean fellow, if he?insults or discriminates between the followers of Vishnu. Similar<br />thoughts are echoed in 2 or 3 more pAsurams. </p>
<p>Now just think, EVR could have done?the same thing like a Thondar-adip-podi Azhwar. But he chose to criticize the Brahmins for everything saying that they created this problem, by?hereditarily discriminating in the name of Caste. But see what his elks are doing now. Are we not starting to see the dynasty politics in vogue now. If in the present day a Doctor's son is a?Doctor and so on, why could things not achieved a pattern, naturally, from a practice which is atleast 3000 years old in history? I am not trying to wash off the bad things that the Brahmins did here. But to blame them squarely is?totally wrong. That is why I say, EVR's struggle in the name of?discrimination, though it had benefitted a few?people, has indeed not created any significant impact for the people in the lower?rungs of the society.</p>
<p>Instead?of becoming an atheist, he could have criticized the Brahmins like this Thondar-adip-podi Azhwar.?But he chose the easiest escape route. Period.</p>
<p><Quote <br />Is it really such a bad thing if it was proven the temple had buddhist origins - both Ezhumalayan and Gautama Buddha are symbols of great mercy and peace to their followers after all?<br /><Unquote </p>
<p>Honestly, I would accept any thing, provided concrete evidences are given. In this case if one reads through Jamnadas, we can see that none of the exhibits given by him, prove without any doubt about the historicity of the claim. For me, if proven, Aiyanar or Avudaiyappan?are the same if proven properly. </p>

<p><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym , I have not seen this fully - in the original Jamnadas book I read therewas no dedication to EVR. It must have been something added later on by those who did the eversion of this book. Jamnadas was a follower of Ambedkar,who was a Buddhist himself. </p>
<p>I can understand your viewpoint that his work might be buddhist biased defintiely. It is not in the least as virulent and anti hindu as EVR. Don't know of history of enemity between azhwars but sometimes history does not always favor sentiments. I know about food history and I do know vegetarianism as we practice today has quite a lot of buddhist input. Also we have to give room for the fact that both Ambedkar and EVR fought significant evils in hindu caste system that are impossible to deny.</p>
<p>All that said - what would you think are the origins of Tirumala? Why is the temple different than other temples? Is it really such a bad thing if it was proven the temple had buddhist origins - both Ezhumalayan and Gautama Buddha are symbols of great mercy and peace to their followers after all?</p>

<p>  Based on the above concept, Buddhism is to have originated only because aSiddhartha, got enlightenment regarding letting go of the desires to get rid of the sorrow in this world. Until then he was a normal Kshatriya. </p>
<p>  Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhist claims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence.So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />  ?<br />  And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>

<p>  Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>  I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>  You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that of Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>  Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl,Vishnu.</p>
<p>a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of theDeity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>  The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link givenby VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?canbe at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>

<p>  Hi <br />  I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>  of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />  vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>  we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumalawas a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>  but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />  how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>

<p>    Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>    I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>    You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that ofSrirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>    Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicates that?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>s a controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times of Ramanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of theDeity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true nature of the deity. </p>
<p>    The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal, a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeed Vishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link given by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>
<p>    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh<br />    ?</p>

<p>    Hi <br />    I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>    of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />    vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>    we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>    but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />    how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>    (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

        <p><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym , I have not seen this fully - in the original Jamnadas book I read therewas no dedication to EVR. It must have been something added later on by those who did the eversion of this book. Jamnadas was a follower of Ambedkar,who was a Buddhist himself. </p>
<p>I can understand your viewpoint that his work might be buddhist biased defintiely. It is not in the least as virulent and anti hindu as EVR. Don't know of history of enemity between azhwars but sometimes history does not always favor sentiments. I know about food history and I do know vegetarianism as we practice today has quite a lot of buddhist input. Also we have to give room for the fact that both Ambedkar and EVR fought significant evils in hindu caste system that are impossible to deny.</p>
<p>All that said - what would you think are the origins of Tirumala? Why is the temple different than other temples? Is it really such a bad thing if it was proven the temple had buddhist origins - both Ezhumalayan and Gautama Buddha are symbols of great mercy and peace to their followers after all?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Is there a mention of a deity by name Avalokiteshwara, who the Buddhist claims to be theirs, before Buddha? We need to think? Just because Buddha has attained an iconographic status an Avalokiteshwara has come to existence. So the claims of Buddhists about the existence of a god by name Avalokiteshwara itself is in question now. I am not relating this to the Thirumala temple issue directly here. But if we accept what Jamnadas says above, under the same logic, even what I have stated above is true.<br />?<br />And WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE BUDDHA? </p>
<p>Very Important Quote from Jamnadas<br /><Quote <br />In any case, the evidence of Alvars is useless in any dispute where a Buddhist claim is involved, because Alvars were quite hostile to Buddhists, as will be seen in next chapter<br /><Unquote </p>
<p>Having quote the above from Jamnadas I invite you all to the first page of his book<br /><Quote <br />Dedication</quote></p>

<p>By his own logic, he proves what I stated in my earlier mail about his own motive and vested interest. Just in the same way as Jamnadas cannot accept Azhwars' claims as they were hostile to Buddhism, needless to say if the above quoted personality Loved or Hated Hinduism. What else can we get to read from a person claiming to be shown the path by the most voracious Hindu Hater?<br />?<br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>I feel that our Dhivakar Sir is an expert in this, than me, due to the massive research he has carried out for his novel Thirumalai Thirudan. However?let me state whatever little I know.</p>
<p>You are?right. Thirumalai?has been sung by Azhwars pretty much. In?fact the number of pAsurams dedicated to Thirumalai is more than that of Srirangam. Ideally Thirumalai should have been the No. 1 Divyadesam. But it just lost its place to Srirangam only for the reason that 11 out of?12 Azhwars have sung?pAsurams on Srirangam while only 10 have sung about?Thirumalai.</p>
<p>Even before the Azhwars, SilappadhikAram, done by a Jain, clearly indicatesthat?Thirumalai Deity is Vishnu. It?terms "mAyOn mEyak kADuRai vEngkadam". "mAyOn" in ancient Thamizh literature is purely for mAl or ThirumAl, Vishnu.</p>
<p>controversy about the nature of the deity in Thirumala, before the times ofRamanuja.?The Vaishnavite Guruparampara says " in the?recent times?during Ramanuja?a new controversy has arisen about the nature?of the Deity in Thirumala. There were people who say it is Siva and some who say it is Muruga and some who say it is Kali. However?Ramanuja laid to rest all the doubts about the nature of deity and proved?that it is?indeed Vishnu.". It?also gives some account as to how he?established the true natureof the deity. </p>
<p>The claims by the Jains are?laid to complete?rest as a?Ilango Adigal,a Jain himself has clearly stated that the?deity of Thirumalai is indeedVishnu. The buddhist claims, I?have?to?read through the link given by VJ. But looking at the?dates of Ilango Adigal,?who indeed have clearly said that Thirumalai?Deity is indeed Vishnu, any counter claims?can be at best doubted with regards?to the?motive of the person writing about it.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br />?</p>

<p>Hi <br />I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumala was a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>(incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>

        <p>VJ, I have read this book - Jamnadas, a very very long time ago. Thanks fore link,must read some chapters again.</p>
<p>Jamnadas is not an atheist or non beliver, and his arguments are truly interesting. One that I do remember is that of Tirumala being the only 'Eka moorthi' shrine, all over south - meaning even no Ganesha or Navagrahas there.</p>

<p>  there are lot of controversies on the the idol - iconography. the main ones are the hands - the original or main statue has only two arms and holds not weapons. the hands holding the conch and discuss are seperately fitted.there is a legend of the lord lending them to a king for use in battle andlater ( during ramanuja period) getting it back. a must read of this incident is dhivakar sir's thirumalai thirudan, a very expert handling of a verycontroversial subject i must say.</p>

          thirupathi temple        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Venkat, I have heard some strong arguments that Tirumala was a Buddhist shrine, dont know regarding muruga or Jain shrine. The statue supposedly resembles some Bodhisattva paintings in Ajanta.<br />Again don't know how true this is but there are books and researches done on it extensively.</p>
<p>Malathi</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "R.venketesh" <abhivencat@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hi <br />  I was just checking up on the thirumala temple to find its area and then this doubt came up.</p>
<p>  of course we must have discussed it in the past too.<br />  vinjamoor venkatesh must be able to handle this.</p>
<p>  we hear of the legend of ramanuja and the contreversy of whther thirumalawas a muruga temple or a perumal temple.</p>
<p>  but havent the alvars sung about thirupathi. wasnt that 500 to 600 years before ramanuja.<br />  how could a contreversy run for so long? or was it generated later?</p>
<p>  (incidentally also read in a jain site that the statue is of a thithankara like saravanabelgola and was converted into a hindu shrine)</p>
