<p>Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>you are correct ..</p>
<p>But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>
<p>following link supports your view ::</p>
<p><a href="http://www.southindianstates.com/tamilnadu_districts/thanjavur/thanjavur-temples1.html" title="http://www.southindianstates.com/tamilnadu_districts/thanjavur/thanjavur-temples1.html">http://www.southindianstates.com/tamilnadu_districts/thanjavur/thanjavur...</a></p>
<p>THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town. </p>
<p>------------<br />The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar and Kudamurutti. <br />---------</p>
<p>The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to diehere is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi, Thirupazhanam,Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great carnatic music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A celebration of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery is well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician to hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of Thiruvaiyaru on the occasion.</p>
<p>In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi MathaShrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the River Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting thisshrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The distancefrom Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand Anicut to Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate everyyear from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>  Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru thalaippu).</p>
<p>  Arisalaru is to be included in its place.</p>

<p>      Thanks for sharing the blog info.<br />      It was really nice blog and the pictures are just fantastic.</p>
<p>      I remember shouting Iyyaaraaa,,, ezhoooraaa etc., during my childhooddays in the nadha brahmam praharam and it was really nice to see the pictures again.?</p>
<p>      The pictures of various lingams are also good. The picture of the ramanadha swamy (rameshwaran) lingam is missing though!?</p>
<p>      Sad to see the frescoes in such a condition.</p>
<p>      Dhyana mandapam picture was taken from ?a different angle I suppose, The picture which has got a description dhyana mandapam actually houses durga, mahalakshmi and saraswathi, the other side of that mandapam is dhyanamandapam and it has got sculptures of Karikalan and his wife ( or atleast believed to be them). Dhyana mandapam hosts vinayagar, the navagraham and the lingams for five elements (agni, vayu, aakaasam, jalam and prithvi), also Dakshinamoorthy is visible through the opening from the dhyana mandapam. Once we get out of the dhyana mandapam we can come across the three markings on the floor where karikalan found the required funds to build the temple.?</p>
<p>      Also the picture shows the sthala viruksham (Vilva maram).<br />      Opposite to the Sthala viruksham we have got the murugan shirine where murugan has got a bow and arrow instead of a javelin/spear which is unusual I don't remember seeing a statue of murugan with bow and arrow other than a spear! Members can help me find some!</p>
<p>      Maragatha lingam mentioned in the blog was hosted in the shirne parallel to the murugan shrine I mentioned above and yeah I had a quite a few glimpses of maragatha lingam when it was taken out for special puja.<br />      ?<br />      Thanks a lot once again for sharing.</p>

<p>    Thanks for sharing the blog info.<br />    It was really nice blog and the pictures are just fantastic.</p>
<p>    I remember shouting Iyyaaraaa,,, ezhoooraaa etc., during my childhood days in the nadha brahmam praharam and it was really nice to see the pictures again.?</p>
<p>    The pictures of various lingams are also good. The picture of the ramanadha swamy (rameshwaran) lingam is missing though!?</p>
<p>    Sad to see the frescoes in such a condition.</p>
<p>    Dhyana mandapam picture was taken from ?a different angle I suppose, The picture which has got a description dhyana mandapam actually houses durga, mahalakshmi and saraswathi, the other side of that mandapam is dhyana mandapam and it has got sculptures of Karikalan and his wife ( or atleast believed to be them). Dhyana mandapam hosts vinayagar, the navagraham and thelingams for five elements (agni, vayu, aakaasam, jalam and prithvi), also Dakshinamoorthy is visible through the opening from the dhyana mandapam. Once we get out of the dhyana mandapam we can come across the three markings on the floor where karikalan found the required funds to build the temple.?</p>
<p>    Also the picture shows the sthala viruksham (Vilva maram).<br />    Opposite to the Sthala viruksham we have got the murugan shirine where murugan has got a bow and arrow instead of a javelin/spear which is unusualI don't remember seeing a statue of murugan with bow and arrow other than a spear! Members can help me find some!</p>
<p>    Maragatha lingam mentioned in the blog was hosted in the shirne parallel to the murugan shrine I mentioned above and yeah I had a quite a few glimpses of maragatha lingam when it was taken out for special puja.<br />    ?<br />    Thanks a lot once again for sharing.</p>

<p>    Dear SPS,<br />    ?</p>
<p>    Thanks for link sir.<br />    ?<br />    Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I come from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />    Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha) alone and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above feels they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.<br />    ?<br />    Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings them back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.<br />    ?<br />    It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside and outside the temple?and thousands of people gathering in the town - just wonderful.<br />    ?<br />    Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained samadhi which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.. usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the world paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).<br />    ?<br />    Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to Thiruvaiyaru..Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from Thiruvaiyaru.<br />    ?<br />    I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!<br />    ?<br />    Thanks and Regards,<br />    Narendran</p>

<p>    Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>    you are correct ..</p>
<p>    But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />    Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>
<p>    following link supports your view ::</p>

<p>    THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>    Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town. </p>
<p>    ------------<br />    The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar and Kudamurutti. <br />    ---------</p>
<p>    The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that todie here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>    The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi, Thirupazhanam, Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great carnatic music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A celebration of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery is well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician to hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of Thiruvaiyaru on the occasion.</p>
<p>    In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi Matha Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the River Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting this shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The distance from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand Anicut to Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate every year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>  Thanks for sharing the blog info.<br />  It was really nice blog and the pictures are just fantastic.</p>
<p>  I remember shouting Iyyaaraaa,,, ezhoooraaa etc., during my childhood days in the nadha brahmam praharam and it was really nice to see the pictures again.?</p>
<p>  The pictures of various lingams are also good. The picture of the ramanadha swamy (rameshwaran) lingam is missing though!?</p>
<p>  Sad to see the frescoes in such a condition.</p>
<p>  Dhyana mandapam picture was taken from ?a different angle I suppose, The picture which has got a description dhyana mandapam actually houses durga, mahalakshmi and saraswathi, the other side of that mandapam is dhyana mandapam and it has got sculptures of Karikalan and his wife ( or atleast believed to be them). Dhyana mandapam hosts vinayagar, the navagraham and the lingams for five elements (agni, vayu, aakaasam, jalam and prithvi), also Dakshinamoorthy is visible through the opening from the dhyana mandapam. Oncewe get out of the dhyana mandapam we can come across the three markings onthe floor where karikalan found the required funds to build the temple.?</p>
<p>  Also the picture shows the sthala viruksham (Vilva maram).<br />  Opposite to the Sthala viruksham we have got the murugan shirine where murugan has got a bow and arrow instead of a javelin/spear which is unusual Idon't remember seeing a statue of murugan with bow and arrow other than a spear! Members can help me find some!</p>
<p>  Maragatha lingam mentioned in the blog was hosted in the shirne parallel to the murugan shrine I mentioned above and yeah I had a quite a few glimpses of maragatha lingam when it was taken out for special puja.<br />  ?<br />  Thanks a lot once again for sharing.</p>

<p>  Dear SPS,<br />  ?</p>
<p>  Thanks for link sir.<br />  ?<br />  Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I come from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />  Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha) alone and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above feels they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.<br />  ?<br />  Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vettiver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings them back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.<br />  ?<br />  It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside and outside the temple?and thousands of people gathering in the town - justwonderful.<br />  ?<br />  Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained samadhi which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.. usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the world paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru. The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).<br />  ?<br />  Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to Thiruvaiyaru..Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from Thiruvaiyaru.<br />  ?<br />  I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!<br />  ?<br />  Thanks and Regards,<br />  Narendran</p>

<p>  Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>  you are correct ..</p>
<p>  But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />  Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>
<p>  following link supports your view ::</p>

<p>  THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>  Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town. </p>
<p>  ------------<br />  The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar andKudamurutti. <br />  ---------</p>
<p>  The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to die here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>  The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi, Thirupazhanam, Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great carnaticmusic composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A celebration of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery iswell known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician to hymnPancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of Thiruvaiyaru on the occasion.</p>
<p>  In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi Matha Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the RiverCauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting this shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The distance from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand Anicutto Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate every year from May 6th to 15th</p>

        <p>Dear Shobha,</p>
<p>Thanks for your immediate response. I have never seen the deepam without<br />being lit in the years (for about 21 years) i lived there... and i remember<br />there was a person who always stays there to ensure that the lamp has got<br />enough oil in there and also to sell the ghee vilakku to devotees... and he<br />usually ensures that the deepam is always lit.. not sure why it wasn't lit<br />when you were there..<br />Dhyana mandapam in the temple is definitely an ideal place to meditate.<br />Either it has got the vibes or we felt so after knowing that it is dhyana<br />mandapam! I myself have sat there for countless hours in dhyana mandapam<br />watching those lingams!</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Narendran</p>

<p>  Yes, Narendran Dhyana mandapam is from a different angle.<br />  Two people were meditating there hence we didnot want to disturb them.<br />  There is also a kalvettu in the dhyana madapam which says about a grant<br />  given by a family to light a deepam there &amp; there is an address therein<br />  which has to be contacted in case the deepam is not lit.

<p>  Thanks for sharing the blog info. It was really nice blog and the pictures<br />  are just fantastic.</p>
<p>  I remember shouting Iyyaaraaa,,, ezhoooraaa etc., during my childhood days<br />  in the nadha brahmam praharam and it was really nice to see the pictures<br />  again.</p>
<p>  The pictures of various lingams are also good. The picture of the ramanadha<br />  swamy (rameshwaran) lingam is missing though!</p>
<p>  Sad to see the frescoes in such a condition.</p>
<p>  Dhyana mandapam picture was taken from a different angle I suppose, The<br />  picture which has got a description dhyana mandapam actually houses durga,<br />  mahalakshmi and saraswathi, the other side of that mandapam is dhyana<br />  mandapam and it has got sculptures of Karikalan and his wife ( or atleast<br />  believed to be them). Dhyana mandapam hosts vinayagar, the navagraham and<br />  the lingams for five elements (agni, vayu, aakaasam, jalam and prithvi),<br />  also Dakshinamoorthy is visible through the opening from the dhyana<br />  mandapam.. Once we get out of the dhyana mandapam we can come across the<br />  three markings on the floor where karikalan found the required funds to<br />  build the temple.</p>
<p>  Also the picture shows the sthala viruksham (Vilva maram).<br />  Opposite to the Sthala viruksham we have got the murugan shirine where<br />  murugan has got a bow and arrow instead of a javelin/spear which is unusual<br />  I don't remember seeing a statue of murugan with bow and arrow other than a<br />  spear! Members can help me find some!</p>
<p>  Maragatha lingam mentioned in the blog was hosted in the shirne parallel to<br />  the murugan shrine I mentioned above and yeah I had a quite a few glimpses<br />  of maragatha lingam when it was taken out for special puja.</p>
<p>  Thanks a lot once again for sharing.</p>

<p>     Dear SPS,</p>
<p>     Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>     Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I<br />     come from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />     Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />     alone and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />     feels they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>     Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and<br />     Vetti ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings<br />     them back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>     It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside<br />     and outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />     wonderful.</p>
<p>     Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />     samadhi which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every<br />     day... usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />     world paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in<br />     thiruvaiyaru.. The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only<br />     on the day he attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>     Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />     Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from<br />     Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>     I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />     members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>
<p>     Thanks and Regards,<br />     Narendran</p>

<p>      Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>      you are correct ..</p>
<p>      But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />      Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>
<p>      following link supports your view ::</p>
<p>      <a href="http://www.southindianstates.com/tamilnadu_districts/thanjavur/thanjavur-temples1.html" title="http://www.southindianstates.com/tamilnadu_districts/thanjavur/thanjavur-temples1.html">http://www.southindianstates.com/tamilnadu_districts/thanjavur/thanjavur...</a></p>
<p>      THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>      Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />      virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>      ------------<br />      The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar<br />      and Kudamurutti.<br />      ---------</p>
<p>      The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />      die here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />      Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />      shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>      The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />      Thirupazhanam, Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The<br />      great carnatic music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here.<br />      A celebration of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river<br />      Cauvery is well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all<br />      over the country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every<br />      musician to hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />      Thiruvaiyaru on the occasion.</p>
<p>      In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />      Matha Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />      River Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are<br />      visiting this shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre.<br />      The distance from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from<br />      Grand Anicut to Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine<br />      celebrate every year from May 6th to 15th</p>
<p>      anbudan. sps</p>
<p>        -<br />        So fast... very good and thanks.</p>
<p>        Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru<br />      thalaippu).</p>
<p>        Arisalaru is to be included in its place.</p>

<p>Dear SPS,<br />?</p>
<p>Thanks for link sir.<br />?<br />Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I comefrom thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha) aloneand hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above feels they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.<br />?<br />Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings them back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.<br />?<br />It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside and outside the temple?and thousands of people gathering in the town - just wonderful.<br />?<br />Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained samadhi which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.. usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the world paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru. Thepancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).<br />?<br />Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to Thiruvaiyaru..Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from Thiruvaiyaru.<br />?<br />I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!<br />?<br />Thanks and Regards,<br />Narendran</p>

<p>THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town. </p>
<p>------------<br />The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar and Kudamurutti. <br />---------</p>
<p>The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to diehere is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi, Thirupazhanam,Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great carnatic music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A celebration of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery is well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician to hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of Thiruvaiyaru on the occasion.</p>
<p>In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi MathaShrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the River Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting thisshrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The distancefrom Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand Anicut to Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate everyyear from May 6th to 15th</p>

          5 Rivers - in Thiruvaiyaru        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Thanks for sharing the blog info.It was really nice blog and the pictures<br />are just fantastic.</p>
<p>I remember shouting Iyyaaraaa,,, ezhoooraaa etc., during my childhood days<br />in the nadha brahmam praharam and it was really nice to see the pictures<br />again.</p>
<p>The pictures of various lingams are also good. The picture of the ramanadha<br />swamy (rameshwaran) lingam is missing though!</p>
<p>Sad to see the frescoes in such a condition.</p>
<p>Dhyana mandapam picture was taken from a different angle I suppose, The<br />picture which has got a description dhyana mandapam actually houses durga,<br />mahalakshmi and saraswathi, the other side of that mandapam is dhyana<br />mandapam and it has got sculptures of Karikalan and his wife ( or atleast<br />believed to be them). Dhyana mandapam hosts vinayagar, the navagraham and<br />the lingams for five elements (agni, vayu, aakaasam, jalam and prithvi),<br />also Dakshinamoorthy is visible through the opening from the dhyana<br />mandapam. Once we get out of the dhyana mandapam we can come across the<br />three markings on the floor where karikalan found the required funds to<br />build the temple.</p>
<p>Also the picture shows the sthala viruksham (Vilva maram).<br />Opposite to the Sthala viruksham we have got the murugan shirine where<br />murugan has got a bow and arrow instead of a javelin/spear which is unusual<br />I don't remember seeing a statue of murugan with bow and arrow other than a<br />spear! Members can help me find some!</p>
<p>Maragatha lingam mentioned in the blog was hosted in the shirne parallel to<br />the murugan shrine I mentioned above and yeah I had a quite a few glimpses<br />of maragatha lingam when it was taken out for special puja.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot once again for sharing.</p>

<p>    Dear SPS,</p>
<p>    Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>    Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I<br />    come from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />    Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />    alone and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />    feels they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>    Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />    ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings them<br />    back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>    It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside<br />    and outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />    wonderful.</p>
<p>    Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />    samadhi which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every<br />    day.. usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />    world paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in<br />    thiruvaiyaru. The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on<br />    the day he attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>    Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />    Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from<br />    Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>    I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />    members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>   Dear SPS,</p>
<p>   Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>   Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I<br />   come from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />   Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />   alone and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />   feels they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>   Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />   ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings them<br />   back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>   It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside and<br />   outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />   wonderful.</p>
<p>   Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained samadhi<br />   which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day..<br />   usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the world<br />   paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />   The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />   attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>   Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />   Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from<br />   Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>   I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />   members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>
<p>   Thanks and Regards,<br />   Narendran</p>

<p>    Dear Narendran,</p>

<p>    THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>    Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />    virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>    ------------<br />    The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar and<br />    Kudamurutti.<br />    ---------</p>
<p>    The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />    die here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />    Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />    shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>    The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />    Thirupazhanam, Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The<br />    great carnatic music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here.<br />    A celebration of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river<br />    Cauvery is well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all<br />    over the country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every<br />    musician to hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />    Thiruvaiyaru on the occasion.</p>
<p>    In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />    Matha Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />    River Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are<br />    visiting this shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre.<br />    The distance from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from<br />    Grand Anicut to Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine<br />    celebrate every year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>      Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru<br />    thalaippu).</p>

<p>1. Kaveri - Spliting into Kaveri &amp; Kollidam at Mukambu<br />2. Kaveri - Spliting into Kaveri &amp; Vennaaru at Kallanai<br />3. Kaveri - Spliting into Kaveri &amp; Kudamurutti river somewhere west to<br />Thiruvaiyaaru<br />Kaveri - Spliting into Kaveri &amp; Arisilaaru somewhere East to<br />Thiruvaiyaaru<br />Vennaru - Spliting into Puthu aaru, Vettaaru, Vadavaaru. (and a small<br />stream called jambu kaveri)</p>
<p>Some more branches of small streams are there, at present I don't have the<br />data with me. Will send the details later.</p>

<p>  Yes Sir.<br />  That was what I said before but I got confused from SPS sir's email that<br />  there is no temple for Brahma!<br />  Thanks for the clarification. I will be visiting Thiruvaiyaru this October<br />  so I shall be able to spend a lot of time around these temples!</p>

<p>   Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>   As you said there are three temples in Thiru Kandiyur. Brahma sira<br />   kandeeswarar on the Eastern Side, Hara Saaba Vimochana Perumal templea and<br />   Brahma temple on the Western Side. When I visited thiruvaiyaaru 3 months<br />   before I saw that Brahma temple is being renovated.</p>

<p>    Dear SPS,</p>
<p>    Thanks for clarifying sir.<br />    For all the years we were told that it is lord brahma statue in the<br />    shivan temple.</p>
<p>    There even was a story among the localites that there was a separate<br />    temple for Lord Brahma but since that is not proper (for whatever reasons!)<br />    they demolished the temple and brought this statue and placed it in the<br />    shivan temple!</p>
<p>    The moolavar in Thirukandiyur is called Brahma Sira kandeeshwarar!</p>
<p>    Could you please let me know who Vageesar is?<br />    I think Thirunavukarasar' s original name was Vageesar!</p>
<p>    Thanks and Regards,<br />    Narendran</p>

<p>     DEAR FRIENDS,</p>
<p>     LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai<br />     Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of<br />     Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the<br />     inscriptions :<br />     Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran<br />     maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL<br />     NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3. KIZHAR KOOTRATHU KUWAVAN KANCJAN &amp;      4.ACHARYAR ANIRUDHAR..</p>
<p>     The Pillars belonged to the Pidari temple constructed earlier by<br />     Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />     (Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />     ============ =====<br />     We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in<br />     nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple.</p>
<p>     Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples)<br />     surrounding Thiruvaiyaru!</p>

<p>     Yeah.. Thiruvedhikudi.</p>
<p>     thanks for correcting.</p>
<p>     regards / sps</p>
<p>     ------------ ------</p>
<p>       Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very<br />     unusual!<br />       so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu<br />     statues<br />       are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>       Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we<br />     have<br />       various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />       I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />       specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter<br />     how the<br />       day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />       Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my<br />     experience!)</p>

<p>         - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>         Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>         NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>         Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also<br />     known<br />         as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>         Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of<br />     Kollidam<br />         flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>         Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />         Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name<br />     Vadavaru.</p>
<p>         You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>         In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>         " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam<br />     during<br />         Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>         Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru<br />     ! in<br />         Chapter 21.</p>
<p>         He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after<br />     crossing<br />         Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>         This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>         You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>     Vennaru -<br />         Vadavaru !</p>
<p>         VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>         RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>         Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam. . I have attended two / three<br />     times....<br />         Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>         You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />         AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>         Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>         Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>         Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />         Krishnaleelatharang ani ...</p>
<p>         And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi<br />     another one<br />         ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>         Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN<br />     KAILASAM by<br />         Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />         Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>         Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here -<br />     prior to<br />         matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>         Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />         thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>         More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his<br />     father as<br />     Danthisakthi<br />         vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>         Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>         " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species<br />     in the<br />         world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>
<p>         wonderful temple !!</p>

<p>           Dear SPS,</p>
<p>           Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>           Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home<br />     town (I<br />         come<br />           from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />           Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar ) goes on the Car (ther<br />     thiruvizha)<br />         alone<br />           and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned<br />     above<br />         feels<br />           they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>           Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi<br />     and Vetti<br />           ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and<br />     brings<br />         them<br />           back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>           It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up<br />     inside<br />         and<br />           outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town-<br />     just<br />           wonderful.</p>
<p>           Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />         samadhi<br />           which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every<br />     day.<br />           usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over<br />     the<br />         world<br />           paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in<br />     thiruvaiyaru.<br />           The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the<br />     day he<br />           attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>           Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />           Thiruvaiyaru. Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms<br />     away<br />         from<br />           Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>           I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known<br />     to our<br />           members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>             Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>             you are correct ..</p>
<p>             But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />             Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>
<p>             following link supports your view ::</p>

<p>             THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>             Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its<br />     name by<br />             virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>             ------------<br />             The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar,<br />     Vettar<br />         and<br />             Kudamurutti.<br />             ---------</p>
<p>             The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief<br />     that to<br />         die<br />             here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />             Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the<br />     seven<br />             shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>             The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />         Thirupazhanam,<br />             Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />         carnatic<br />             music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />         celebration<br />             of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river<br />     Cauvery<br />         is<br />             well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all<br />     over the<br />             country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every<br />     musician<br />         to<br />             hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />         Thiruvaiyaru<br />             on the occasion.</p>
<p>             In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a<br />     Poondi<br />         Matha<br />             Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between<br />     the<br />         River<br />             Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are<br />     visiting<br />         this<br />             shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre.<br />     The<br />         distance<br />             from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from<br />     Grand<br />         Anicut to<br />             Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine<br />     celebrate<br />         every<br />             year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>  Yes Sir. </p>
<p>  That was what I said before but I got confused from SPS sir's email that there is no temple for Brahma!<br />  Thanks for the clarification. I will be visiting Thiruvaiyaru this October so I shall be able to spend a lot of time around these temples!</p>

<p>   Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>   As you said there are three temples in Thiru Kandiyur. Brahma sira kandeeswarar on the Eastern Side, Hara Saaba Vimochana Perumal templea and Brahma temple on the Western Side. When I visited thiruvaiyaaru 3 months before I saw that Brahma temple is being renovated. </p>

<p>    Dear SPS,</p>
<p>    Thanks for clarifying sir. <br />    For all the years we were told that it is lord brahma statue in the shivan temple.</p>
<p>    There even was a story among the localites that there was a separate temple for Lord Brahma but since that is not proper (for whatever reasons!)<br />    they demolished the temple and brought this statue and placed it in theshivan temple!</p>
<p>    The moolavar in Thirukandiyur is called Brahma Sira kandeeshwarar!</p>
<p>    Could you please let me know who Vageesar is? <br />    I think Thirunavukarasar' s original name was Vageesar! </p>
<p>    Thanks and Regards,<br />    Narendran</p>

<p>     DEAR FRIENDS, </p>
<p>     LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai <br />     Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of <br />     Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the <br />     inscriptions :<br />     Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran <br />     maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL <br />     NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3. KIZHAR KOOTRATHU KUWAVAN KANCJAN &amp;4.ACHARYAR ANIRUDHAR..</p>
<p>     The Pillars belonged to the Pidari<br />      temple constructed earlier by <br />     Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />     (Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />     ============ ===== <br />     We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple. </p>
<p>     Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples) <br />     surrounding Thiruvaiyaru! </p>
<p>     -Fondly -sps<br />     ============ ========= =</p>
<p>     Yeah.. Thiruvedhikudi.</p>
<p>     thanks for correcting.</p>
<p>     regards / sps</p>
<p>     ------------ ------ </p>
<p>       Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very unusual!<br />       so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu statues<br />       are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>       Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we have<br />       various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />       I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />       specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter how the<br />       day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />       Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my experience!)</p>
<p>ce where<br />       I lived for about 22 years (90 % of my life time so far).</p>

<p>         - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>         Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>         NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>         Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also known<br />         as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>         Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of Kollidam<br />         flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>         Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />         Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name Vadavaru.</p>
<p>         You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>         In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>         " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam during</p>
<p>      Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>         Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru ! in<br />         Chapter 21.</p>
<p>         He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - aftercrossing<br />         Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>         This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>         You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>ennaru -<br />         Vadavaru !</p>
<p>         VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>         RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>         Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam. . I have attended two / three times....<br />         Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>         You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is</p>
<p>      AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>         Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>         Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>         Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />         Krishnaleelatharang ani ...</p>
<p>         And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another one<br />         ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>         Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAM by<br />         Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />         Highly informative historically.</p>

<p>           Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>           Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I<br />         come<br />           from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />           Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar ) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />         alone<br />           and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />         feels<br />           they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>           Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />           ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings<br />         them<br />           back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>           It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up<br />      inside<br />         and<br />           outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town- just<br />           wonderful.</p>
<p>           Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />         samadhi<br />           which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />           usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all overthe<br />         world<br />           paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />           The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />           attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>           Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />           Thiruvaiyaru. Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away<br />         from<br />           Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>           I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />           members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>             Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>             you are correct ..</p>
<p>             But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />             Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>
<p>             following link supports your view ::</p>

<p>             THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>             Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />             virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>             ------------<br />             The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar,Vettar<br />         and<br />             Kudamurutti.<br />             ---------</p>
<p>             The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />         die<br />             here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />             Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />             shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>             The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />         Thirupazhanam,<br />             Thiruvedhikudi,<br />      Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />         carnatic<br />             music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />         celebration<br />             of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of riverCauvery<br />         is<br />             well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the<br />             country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician<br />         to<br />             hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />         Thiruvaiyaru<br />             on the occasion.</p>
<p>             In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is aPoondi<br />         Matha<br />             Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in betweenthe<br />         River<br />             Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of<br />      pilgrims are visiting<br />         this<br />             shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The<br />         distance<br />             from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand<br />         Anicut to<br />             Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate<br />         every<br />             year from May 6th to 15th</p>
<p>             anbudan. sps</p>
<p>               -<br />               So fast.... very good and thanks.</p>

          5 Rivers - in Thiruvaiyaru        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>The Brahma Temple in THIRUPPATTUR - near Padalur / Trichy Dt (of Masathan -Cheraman Perumal - Thirukkayilaya Gnanaula episode) is becoming popular oflate ....</p>
<p>The Temple is famous as " FATE CHANGING BRAHMA " !</p>
<p>Some of my friends have First hand experience .. in their personal life ...</p>
<p>Some could Career matters sorted out to their liking .. and overcome hurdles..</p>
<p>Some fractured-marriages set right ..</p>
<p>some even reported better (eye) vision ... etc., etc.. contrary to medical advice that no further scope for improvement !!</p>
<p>Uthamarkoil Brahma (Vishnu - Siva) temple and Kumbakonam (near Theradi) Brahma Temples are also famous ...</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there should have been a Brahma idol in Thirukandiyur too - since it is Veerattanam related to Brahma's head being removed for not knowingmeaning of Pranava !</p>
<p>And in the nearby Vinnagaram, Perumal has given Sabavimochanam to Siva since the skull of Brahma got stuck !!</p>
<p>The supposedly Brahma idol in Thirukandiyur is that of Vageesa (of Siva form) !</p>
<p>This is derived based on iconographical details by Dr. Nagaswamy and also by Dr. Kudavayil Balasubramanian also.</p>
<p>Essence is Iconographically EVEN SIVA sits on LOTUS and HAVE AKSHAMALA and that does not mean the ICON in BRAHMA !!</p>
<p>Regards / sps</p>

<p>  Yes Sir. </p>
<p>  That was what I said before but I got confused from SPS sir's email that there is no temple for Brahma!<br />  Thanks for the clarification. I will be visiting Thiruvaiyaru this October so I shall be able to spend a lot of time around these temples!</p>

<p>  Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>  As you said there are three temples in Thiru Kandiyur. Brahma sira kandeeswarar on the Eastern Side, Hara Saaba Vimochana Perumal templea and Brahmatemple on the Western Side. When I visited thiruvaiyaaru 3 months before Isaw that Brahma temple is being renovated. </p>

<p>  Dear SPS,</p>
<p>  Thanks for clarifying sir.?<br />  For all the years we were told that it is lord brahma statue in the shivan temple.</p>
<p>  There even was a story among the localites that there was a separate temple for Lord Brahma but since that is not proper (for whatever reasons!)<br />  they demolished the temple and brought this statue and placed it in the shivan temple!</p>
<p>  The moolavar in Thirukandiyur is called Brahma Sira kandeeshwarar!</p>
<p>  Could you please let me know who Vageesar is??<br />  I think Thirunavukarasar' s original name was Vageesar!?</p>

<p>  DEAR FRIENDS, </p>
<p>  LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai <br />  Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of <br />  Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the <br />  inscriptions :<br />  Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran <br />  maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL <br />  NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3.

<p>  The Pillars belonged to the Pidari temple constructed earlier by <br />  Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />  (Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />  ============ ===== <br />  We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple. </p>
<p>  Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples) <br />  surrounding Thiruvaiyaru! </p>

<p>    Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very unusual!<br />    so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu statues<br />    are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>    Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we have<br />    various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />    I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />    specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter howthe<br />    day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />    Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my experience!)</p>
<p>where<br />    I lived for about 22 years (90 % of my life time so far).</p>

<p>      - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>      Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>      NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>      Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also known<br />      as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>      Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of Kollidam<br />      flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>      Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />      Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name Vadavaru.</p>
<p>      You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>      In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>      " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam during<br />      Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>      Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru !in<br />      Chapter 21.</p>
<p>      He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after crossing<br />      Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>      This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>      You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>aru -<br />      Vadavaru !</p>
<p>      VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>      RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>      Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam. . I have attended two / three times....<br />      Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>      You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />      AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>      Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>      Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>      Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />      Krishnaleelatharang ani ...</p>
<p>      And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another one<br />      ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>      Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAM by<br />      Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />      Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>      Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here - prior to<br />      matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>      Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />      thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>      More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father as<br />i<br />      vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>      Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>      " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species in the<br />      world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>

<p>        Dear SPS,</p>
<p>        Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>        Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town(I<br />      come<br />        from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />        Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar ) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />      alone<br />        and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />      feels<br />        they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>        Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi andVetti<br />        ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings<br />      them<br />        back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>        It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside<br />      and<br />        outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />        wonderful.</p>
<p>        Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />      samadhi<br />        which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />        usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />      world<br />        paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />        The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />        attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>        Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />        Thiruvaiyaru. Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away<br />      from<br />        Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>        I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />        members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>          But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />          Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>

<p>          THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>          Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />          virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>          ------------<br />          The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar<br />      and<br />          Kudamurutti.<br />          ---------</p>
<p>          The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />      die<br />          here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />          Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />          shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>          The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />      Thirupazhanam,<br />          Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />      carnatic<br />          music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />      celebration<br />          of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery<br />      is<br />          well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the<br />          country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician<br />      to<br />          hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />      Thiruvaiyaru<br />          on the occasion.</p>
<p>          In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />      Matha<br />          Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />      River<br />          Cauvery and Coleroon.

<p>Yes Sir. </p>
<p>That was what I said before but I got confused from SPS sir's email that there is no temple for Brahma!<br />Thanks for the clarification. I will be visiting Thiruvaiyaru this October so I shall be able to spend a lot of time around these temples!</p>

<p>Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>As you said there are three temples in Thiru Kandiyur. Brahma sira kandeeswarar on the Eastern Side, Hara Saaba Vimochana Perumal templea and Brahma temple on the Western Side. When I visited thiruvaiyaaru 3 months before I saw that Brahma temple is being renovated. </p>

<p>2009/6/24 Narendran S <snarendran@gmail. com  </p>
<p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying sir.?<br />For all the years we were told that it is lord brahma statue in the shivan temple.</p>
<p>There even was a story among the localites that there was a separate templefor Lord Brahma but since that is not proper (for whatever reasons!)<br />they demolished the temple and brought this statue and placed it in the shivan temple!</p>
<p>The moolavar in Thirukandiyur is called Brahma Sira kandeeshwarar!</p>
<p>Could you please let me know who Vageesar is??<br />I think Thirunavukarasar' s original name was Vageesar!?</p>

<p>DEAR FRIENDS, </p>
<p>LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai <br />Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of <br />Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the <br />inscriptions :<br />Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran <br />maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL <br />NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3.

<p>The Pillars belonged to the Pidari temple constructed earlier by <br />Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />(Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />============ ===== <br />We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple. </p>
<p>Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples) <br />surrounding Thiruvaiyaru! </p>

<blockquote><p>  Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very unusual!<br />  so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu statues<br />  are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>  Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we have<br />  various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />  I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />  specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter how the<br />  day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />  Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my experience!)</p>

<p>    - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>    Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>    NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>    Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also known<br />    as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>    Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of Kollidam<br />    flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>    Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />    Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name Vadavaru.</p>
<p>    You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>    In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>    " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam during<br />    Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>    Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru ! in<br />    Chapter 21.</p>
<p>    He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after crossing<br />    Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>    This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>    You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>u -<br />    Vadavaru !</p>
<p>    VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>    RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>    Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam. . I have attended two / three times....<br />    Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>    You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />    AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>    Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>    Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>    Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />    Krishnaleelatharang ani ...</p>
<p>    And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another one<br />    ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>    Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAMby<br />    Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />    Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>    Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here - prior to<br />    matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>    Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />    thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>    More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father as<br />    vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>    Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>    " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species in the<br />    world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>

<blockquote><p>      Dear SPS,</p>
<p>      Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>      Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I<br />    come<br />      from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />      Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar ) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />    alone<br />      and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />    feels<br />      they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>      Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />      ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings<br />    them<br />      back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>      It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside<br />    and<br />      outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />      wonderful.</p>
<p>      Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />    samadhi<br />      which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />      usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />    world<br />      paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />      The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />      attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>      Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />      Thiruvaiyaru. Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away<br />    from<br />      Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>      I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />      members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>        you are correct ..</p>

<p>        THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>        Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />        virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>        ------------<br />        The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar<br />    and<br />        Kudamurutti.<br />        ---------</p>
<p>        The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />    die<br />        here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />        Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />        shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>        The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />    Thirupazhanam,<br />        Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />    carnatic<br />        music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />    celebration<br />        of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery<br />    is<br />        well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the<br />        country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician<br />    to<br />        hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />    Thiruvaiyaru<br />        on the occasion.</p>
<p>        In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />    Matha<br />        Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />    River<br />        Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting<br />    this<br />        shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The<br />    distance<br />        from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand<br />    Anicut to<br />        Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate<br />    every<br />        year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>          Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru<br />        thalaippu).</p>

<p>Yes Sir.</p>
<p>That was what I said before but I got confused from SPS sir's email that there is no temple for Brahma!<br />Thanks for the clarification. I will be visiting Thiruvaiyaru this October so I shall be able to spend a lot of time around these temples!</p>

<p>Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>As you said there are three temples in Thiru Kandiyur. Brahma sira kandeeswarar on the Eastern Side, Hara Saaba Vimochana Perumal templea and Brahma temple on the Western Side. When I visited thiruvaiyaaru 3 months before I saw that Brahma temple is being renovated. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satheesh kumar R</p>
<p>2009/6/24 Narendran S <snarendran@gmail. com </p>
<p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying sir.?<br />For all the years we were told that it is lord brahma statue in the shivan temple.</p>
<p>There even was a story among the localites that there was a separate templefor Lord Brahma but since that is not proper (for whatever reasons!)<br />they demolished the temple and brought this statue and placed it in the shivan temple!</p>
<p>The moolavar in Thirukandiyur is called Brahma Sira kandeeshwarar!</p>
<p>Could you please let me know who Vageesar is??<br />I think Thirunavukarasar's original name was Vageesar!?</p>

<p>DEAR FRIENDS, </p>
<p>LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai <br />Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of <br />Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the <br />inscriptions :<br />Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran <br />maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL <br />NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3. KIZHAR KOOTRATHU KUWAVAN KANCJAN &amp; 4.ACHARYAR ANIRUDHAR..</p>
<p>The Pillars belonged to the Pidari temple constructed earlier by <br />Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />(Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />============ ===== <br />We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple. </p>
<p>Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples) <br />surrounding Thiruvaiyaru! </p>

<p>Yeah.. Thiruvedhikudi.</p>
<p>thanks for correcting.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very unusual!<br />  so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu statues<br />  are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>  Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we have<br />  various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />  I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />  specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter how the<br />  day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />  Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my experience!)</p>
<p>ere<br />  I lived for about 22 years (90 % of my life time so far).</p>

<p>    - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>    Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>    NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>    Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also known<br />    as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>    Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of Kollidam<br />    flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>    Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />    Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name Vadavaru.</p>
<p>    You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>    In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>    " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam during<br />    Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>    Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru ! in<br />    Chapter 21.</p>
<p>    He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after crossing<br />    Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>    This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>    You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>u -<br />    Vadavaru !</p>
<p>    VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>    RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>    Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam. . I have attended two / three times....<br />    Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>    You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />    AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>    Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>    Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>    Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />    Krishnaleelatharang ani ...</p>
<p>    And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another one<br />    ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>    Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAMby<br />    Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />    Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>    Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here - prior to<br />    matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>    Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />    thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>    More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father as<br />    vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>    Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>    " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species in the<br />    world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>
<p>    wonderful temple !!</p>

<blockquote><p>      Dear SPS,</p>
<p>      Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>      Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I<br />    come<br />      from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />      Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar ) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />    alone<br />      and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />    feels<br />      they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>      Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />      ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings<br />    them<br />      back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>      It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside<br />    and<br />      outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />      wonderful.</p>
<p>      Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />    samadhi<br />      which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />      usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />    world<br />      paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />      The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />      attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>      Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />      Thiruvaiyaru. Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away<br />    from<br />      Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>      I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />      members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>        you are correct ..</p>

<p>        THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>        Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />        virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>        ------------<br />        The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar<br />    and<br />        Kudamurutti.<br />        ---------</p>
<p>        The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />    die<br />        here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />        Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />        shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>        The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />    Thirupazhanam,<br />        Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />    carnatic<br />        music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />    celebration<br />        of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery<br />    is<br />        well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the<br />        country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician<br />    to<br />        hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />    Thiruvaiyaru<br />        on the occasion.</p>
<p>        In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />    Matha<br />        Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />    River<br />        Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting<br />    this<br />        shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The<br />    distance<br />        from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand<br />    Anicut to<br />        Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate<br />    every<br />        year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>          -<br />          So fast... very good and thanks.</p>
<p>          Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru<br />        thalaippu).</p>
<p>          Arisalaru is to be included in its place.</p>

        <p>Dear Satheesh &amp; Narendran,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume5/articles/article6.xml" title="http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume5/articles/article6.xml">http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume5/articles/article6.xml</a></p>
<p>Above article Dr. Nagaswamy in tamilartsacademy would clarify that it is NOT BRAHMA but another form of Siva - which is kept in worship as Brahma in thirukandiyur - though the Sthalam is related to Brahman-beheaded tale !</p>
<p>Near Kandiyur there was a Nandhipuram and here existed Sundara Cholan &amp; Vaanavan Madevi's Pallippadai and hence he was known as "Pon Maaligai ThunjiyaDevar".</p>
<p>Presently this place is known as Rettakkoil, Veerasingampettai,<br />Sengamedu &amp; Aavikkarai in Thirukkandiyur. </p>
<p>People are finding Sivalingams - of that Ayirathali even today while digging. Some of them have been used in reinforcing KALLANI .. Like some of the portion of Gangaikonda cholapuram temple walls were used !</p>
<p>Some of the Lingams are now housed on the Northern portion of the Big Temple !</p>
<p>Present Thirukandiyur temple is rebuilt using some of the other delapidatedtemple structures too - including Rettaikoil !</p>
<p>Summerising : NANDHIPURAM is not the one near PAZHAYARAI wherein there wasPalace and the Ponmaligai (Thunjiya) wherein Sundara chola passed away wasNOT IN KANCHI but near Thirukandiyur !!</p>

<p>Re: NANDHIPURAM @ THIRUKKANDIYUR :: THANJAVUR </p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Those who have read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  are familiar with Nandhipuram. This is<br />near Pazhayarai (Kumbakonam). There was another Nandhipuram near<br />Thanjavur ? Thiruvayaru - Thirukkandiyur. Kudavoil<br />Balasubramanian has established that it was Thanjavur Nandhipuram which wasthe Capital of Cholas and Not Pazhayarai Nandhipuram. As a matter of fact,except an ancient Copper image, nothing else here resembles Chola period. Following is the gist from his book NANDHIPURAM ::</acronym></p>
<p>Author: Kudavoil Balasubramanian : Published by INTACH in 1992. South Indian Adviser : Dr.Nagaswamy, (The Indian<br />National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage).</p>
<p>R.Gopalan says In History of Pallavas of South India:<br />Nandhipuram is identical with Nandhipura Vinnagaram of Thirumangai<br />alwar near Kknm;</p>
<p>KA Sastri :: History of South India<br />Earlier Rajasimha formed an alliance with Vikramaditya II and<br />after inflicting a number of defeats on Nandhivarman, Pallavamalla<br />besieged him in a place called Nandigrama i.e., Nandhipuram near Kumbakonam?</p>
<p>M.RASAMANICKANAR :: Pallavar Varalaru</p>
<p>Nandhipuram @ Nadhankoil was near Kumbakonam, with a Perumal<br />temple.</p>
<p>Sundarachozhan is known as Nandhipura Sundaracholar which place is 3 KM south west of Kumbakonam. RAJARAJAN in his last days was bed-<br />ridden in the Aayirathali Palace in Pazhayarai. (Don't know how<br />this information was derived)</p>
<p>Source for these statements is from Thirukkodikka<br />inscription : "Idhuvum oru Pazhangalpadi Kovirajakesari panmarkku<br />yaandu 15vadhu PAZHAYATRU NANDHIPURATHU vyapari Kumaran Kanavathi<br />Thirukkodikka Mahadevakku.. grant"</p>
<p>person is from Pazhayarai Nandhipuram. There is another Umbala<br />naattu Nandhipuram (near Vedharanyam).</p>
<p>Subject Nandhipuram is NITHA VINODHA VALANATTU KIZHAR KOOTRATHIL<br />AAYIRATHALI NANDHIPURAM. Pazhayarai Nandhipuram is Uyyakondar<br />valanaattu Thirunaraiyur Nattu (Thirunaraiyur = Nachiarkoil)<br />Pazhayarai Nandhipuram.</p>
<p>Other sources: (1) Grant to Thiruppalanam by Kizhaar Kootrathu<br />Devadhana Nandhipuram Aayirathali thiruvadi.." (2)Thiruchotruthurai<br />grant by "Nandhipuramana aayirathali vyabari mazhapadi.. " ?<br />belonging to Parantaka I.</p>
<p>There were only TWO Aayirathalis in Tamil History: </p>
<p>(1) Pandiya kulanasini valanattu aarkkattu kkootrathu Niyamathu Aayirathali; (2) Nithavinodha valanattu Kizhar kootrathu Nandhipuramana aayirathali.</p>
<p>Nemam is near Thirukkattuppalli. There is another interesting<br />theory. Here was the original Kallanai. I have already put this<br />in one of my earlier mails. </p>
<p>In Pazhayarai there was no Aayirathali.</p>
<p>Niyamathu Sahasralingeswaram says Senthalai inscription.</p>
<p>Thalicheri inscriptions in Big Temple denote the shares for:</p>
<p>Door no: 49 Aayirathali Nakkan aiyaru; 18: Aayirathali Nakkan<br />Anavaradha Sundari; 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 26, 35, 36, 37 ? were<br />also belonged to various Nakkans of Aayirathali.</p>
<p>Thirukkandiyur inscriptions talk of Vaageesar (Laguleesam ::<br />earlier mail) Vanavan Madecharam etc.</p>
<p>Periya Pazhuvettarayar was MARAVAN KANDANAR . (Ref: Earlier mails<br />on this subject : including Udayarkudi inscriptions) Melappazhuvur<br />inscriptions in his 10th and 11th Regnl. <br />Yrs speak of : " Pazhuvettarayar Maravan Kandanar Avani Kandarpurathu mandrupadu epperpattathu pandai Nandhipura mattradhiye kollka enru aruli? "</p>
<p>For new systems of Avani Kandarvapuram, follow the system that exists in Nandhipuram "</p>
<p>After destroying Cholas, Sundara Pandiyan performed his<br />Veerabishekam in this Nandhipuram palace only ? according to Thiruparankundram inscription. <br />This is reconfirmed in Srivilliputhur inscription.</p>
<p>Since this was Pallava's place, this was not under Chola's control<br />till Parantaka I. After Sundara cholan, Kulothunga I used this<br />Palace which was known as Ahavamalla Kulakavathu Palace ? Kalingarayan Seat. </p>
<p>The grant conferred for Buddist Vihar in Nagai is known as<br />Small Leiden Copper plates. </p>
<p>This place was also known as MEENAVANAI MEN KANDA CHOLAPURAM. </p>
<p>Hence Sundara Pandya performed his Veerabishekam here. <br />By Valavan, there is an interpretation for Killivalavan also. </p>
<p>Rajendra brought Indira aaram (maalai) and<br />Sundara Mudi (Crown of Pandyas) from Ealam. </p>
<p>Kulothunga III destroyed Madurai Palace and seeded Varahu and ploughed withDonkeys. </p>
<p>That is why Sundara Pandyan has taken his revenge in similar way against the Imperial Cholas. </p>
<p>Here existed Sundara Cholan &amp; Vaanavan Madevi's<br />Pallippadai and hence he was known as "Pon Maaligai Thunjiya Devar".</p>
<p>Presently this place is known as Rettakkoil, Veerasingampettai,<br />Sengamedu &amp; Aavikkarai in Thirukkandiyur. Wherever they dig, the<br />people are finding Sivalingams.<br />===========================================</p>
<p>Dear Friends,<br />The thought of Nandhipuram has been haunting me for quite some time.<br />Last Sunday, I visited Nandhipuram @ Veerasingampettai<br />(Thirukkandiyur) with Dr.Kudavoil Balu. In 3 / 4 nearby temples we<br />have seen more than 500 lingas -residuals of Ayirathalai!</p>

<p>    Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>    As you said there are three temples in Thiru Kandiyur. Brahma sira<br />    kandeeswarar on the Eastern Side, Hara Saaba Vimochana Perumal templea and<br />    Brahma temple on the Western Side.

<p>     Dear SPS,</p>
<p>     Thanks for clarifying sir.<br />     For all the years we were told that it is lord brahma statue in the shivan<br />     temple.</p>
<p>     There even was a story among the localites that there was a separate<br />     temple for Lord Brahma but since that is not proper (for whatever reasons!)<br />     they demolished the temple and brought this statue and placed it in the<br />     shivan temple!</p>
<p>     The moolavar in Thirukandiyur is called Brahma Sira kandeeshwarar!</p>
<p>     Could you please let me know who Vageesar is?<br />     I think Thirunavukarasar's original name was Vageesar!</p>

<p>      DEAR FRIENDS,</p>
<p>      LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai<br />      Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of<br />      Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the<br />      inscriptions :<br />      Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran<br />      maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL<br />      NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3. KIZHAR KOOTRATHU KUWAVAN KANCJAN &amp;       4.ACHARYAR ANIRUDHAR..</p>
<p>      The Pillars belonged to the Pidari temple constructed earlier by<br />      Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />      (Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />      =================<br />      We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in<br />      nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple.</p>
<p>      Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples)<br />      surrounding Thiruvaiyaru!</p>

<p>      Yeah.. Thiruvedhikudi.</p>
<p>      thanks for correcting.</p>

<p>      ------------------</p>
<p>        Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very<br />      unusual!<br />        so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu<br />      statues<br />        are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>        Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we<br />      have<br />        various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />        I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />        specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matterhow<br />      the<br />        day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />        Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my<br />      experience!)</p>

<p>          - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>          Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>          NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>          Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also<br />      known<br />          as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>          Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of<br />      Kollidam<br />          flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>          Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />          Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name<br />      Vadavaru.</p>
<p>          You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>          In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>          " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam<br />      during<br />          Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>          Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru !<br />      in<br />          Chapter 21.</p>
<p>          He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after<br />      crossing<br />          Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>          This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>          You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>      Vennaru -<br />          Vadavaru !</p>
<p>          VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>          RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>          Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam.. I have attended two / three<br />      times...<br />          Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>          You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />          AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>          Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>          Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>

<p>            Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>            Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town<br />      (I<br />          come<br />            from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />            Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther<br />      thiruvizha)<br />          alone<br />            and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned<br />      above<br />          feels<br />            they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>            Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadiand<br />      Vetti<br />            ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and<br />      brings<br />          them<br />            back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>            It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up<br />      inside<br />          and<br />            outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town -<br />      just<br />            wonderful.</p>
<p>            Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />          samadhi<br />            which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every<br />      day.<br />            usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over<br />      the<br />          world<br />            paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in<br />      thiruvaiyaru.<br />            The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the<br />      day he<br />            attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>            Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />            Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms<br />      away<br />          from<br />            Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>            I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known<br />      to our<br />            members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>              you are correct ..</p>
<p>              But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />              Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>

<p>              THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>              Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its<br />      name by<br />              virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>

<p>  Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>  As you said there are three temples in Thiru Kandiyur. Brahma sira<br />  kandeeswarar on the Eastern Side, Hara Saaba Vimochana Perumal templea and<br />  Brahma temple on the Western Side. When I visited thiruvaiyaaru 3 months<br />  before I saw that Brahma temple is being renovated.</p>

<p>  2009/6/24 Narendran S <snarendran@gmail.com </p>
<p>   Dear SPS,</p>
<p>   Thanks for clarifying sir.<br />   For all the years we were told that it is lord brahma statue in the shivan<br />   temple.</p>
<p>   There even was a story among the localites that there was a separate<br />   temple for Lord Brahma but since that is not proper (for whatever reasons!)<br />   they demolished the temple and brought this statue and placed it in the<br />   shivan temple!</p>
<p>   The moolavar in Thirukandiyur is called Brahma Sira kandeeshwarar!</p>
<p>   Could you please let me know who Vageesar is?<br />   I think Thirunavukarasar's original name was Vageesar!</p>

<p>    DEAR FRIENDS,</p>
<p>    LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai<br />    Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of<br />    Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the<br />    inscriptions :<br />    Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran<br />    maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL<br />    NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3. KIZHAR KOOTRATHU KUWAVAN KANCJAN &amp;     4.ACHARYAR ANIRUDHAR..</p>
<p>    The Pillars belonged to the Pidari temple constructed earlier by<br />    Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />    (Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />    =================<br />    We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in<br />    nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple.</p>
<p>    Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples)<br />    surrounding Thiruvaiyaru!</p>
<p>    -Fondly -sps<br />    ======================</p>
<p>    Yeah.. Thiruvedhikudi.</p>
<p>    thanks for correcting.</p>
<p>    regards / sps</p>
<p>    ------------------</p>
<p>      Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very<br />    unusual!<br />      so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu<br />    statues<br />      are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>      Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we<br />    have<br />      various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />      I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />      specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter how<br />    the<br />      day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />      Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my<br />    experience!)</p>
<p>e<br />    where<br />      I lived for about 22 years (90 % of my life time so far).</p>

<p>        - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>        Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>        NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>        Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also<br />    known<br />        as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>        Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of<br />    Kollidam<br />        flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>        Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />        Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name<br />    Vadavaru.</p>
<p>        You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>        In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>        " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam<br />    during<br />        Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>        Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru!<br />    in<br />        Chapter 21.</p>
<p>        He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after<br />    crossing<br />        Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>        This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>        You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>    Vennaru -<br />        Vadavaru !</p>
<p>        VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>        RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>        Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam.. I have attended two / three<br />    times...<br />        Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>        You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />        AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>        Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>

<p>        Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN<br />    KAILASAM by<br />        Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />        Highly informative historically.</p>

<p>          Dear SPS,</p>
<p>          Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>          Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town<br />    (I<br />        come<br />          from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />          Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther<br />    thiruvizha)<br />        alone<br />          and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned<br />    above<br />        feels<br />          they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>          Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and<br />    Vetti<br />          ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and<br />    brings<br />        them<br />          back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>          It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up<br />    inside<br />        and<br />          outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town -<br />    just<br />          wonderful.</p>
<p>          Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />        samadhi<br />          which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every<br />    day.<br />          usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over<br />    the<br />        world<br />          paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in<br />    thiruvaiyaru.<br />          The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the<br />    day he<br />          attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>          Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />          Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms<br />    away<br />        from<br />          Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>          I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known<br />    to our<br />          members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>            Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its<br />    name by<br />            virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>            ------------<br />            The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar,<br />    Vettar<br />        and<br />            Kudamurutti.<br />            ---------</p>
<p>            The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief<br />    that to<br />        die<br />            here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation.

        <p>Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>As you said there are three temples in Thiru Kandiyur. Brahma sira<br />kandeeswarar on the Eastern Side, Hara Saaba Vimochana Perumal templea and<br />Brahma temple on the Western Side. When I visited thiruvaiyaaru 3 months<br />before I saw that Brahma temple is being renovated.</p>

<p>  Dear SPS,</p>
<p>  Thanks for clarifying sir.<br />  For all the years we were told that it is lord brahma statue in the shivan<br />  temple.</p>
<p>  There even was a story among the localites that there was a separate temple<br />  for Lord Brahma but since that is not proper (for whatever reasons!)<br />  they demolished the temple and brought this statue and placed it in the<br />  shivan temple!</p>
<p>  The moolavar in Thirukandiyur is called Brahma Sira kandeeshwarar!</p>
<p>  Could you please let me know who Vageesar is?<br />  I think Thirunavukarasar's original name was Vageesar!</p>

<p>   DEAR FRIENDS,</p>
<p>   LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai<br />   Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of<br />   Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the<br />   inscriptions :<br />   Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran<br />   maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL<br />   NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3. KIZHAR KOOTRATHU KUWAVAN KANCJAN &amp;    4.ACHARYAR ANIRUDHAR..</p>
<p>   The Pillars belonged to the Pidari temple constructed earlier by<br />   Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />   (Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />   =================<br />   We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in<br />   nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple.</p>
<p>   Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples)<br />   surrounding Thiruvaiyaru!</p>
<p>   -Fondly -sps<br />   ======================</p>
<p>   Yeah.. Thiruvedhikudi.</p>
<p>   thanks for correcting.</p>
<p>   regards / sps</p>
<p>   ------------------</p>
<p>     Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very<br />   unusual!<br />     so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu<br />   statues<br />     are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>     Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we<br />   have<br />     various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />     I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />     specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter how<br />   the<br />     day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />     Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my<br />   experience!)</p>
<p>   where<br />     I lived for about 22 years (90 % of my life time so far).</p>

<p>       - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>       Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>       NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>       Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also<br />   known<br />       as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>       Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of<br />   Kollidam<br />       flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>       Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />       Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name<br />   Vadavaru.</p>
<p>       You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>       In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>       " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam<br />   during<br />       Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>       Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru !<br />   in<br />       Chapter 21.</p>
<p>       He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after<br />   crossing<br />       Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>       This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>       You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>   Vennaru -<br />       Vadavaru !</p>
<p>       VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>       RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>       Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam.. I have attended two / three<br />   times...<br />       Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>       You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />       AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>       Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>       Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>       Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />       Krishnaleelatharangani ...</p>
<p>       And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another<br />   one<br />       ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>       Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN<br />   KAILASAM by<br />       Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />       Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>       Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here -<br />   prior to<br />       matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>       Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />       thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>       More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father<br />   as<br />       vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>       Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>       " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species in<br />   the<br />       world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>

<p>         Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>         Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town<br />   (I<br />       come<br />         from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />         Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther<br />   thiruvizha)<br />       alone<br />         and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned<br />   above<br />       feels<br />         they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>         Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and<br />   Vetti<br />         ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and<br />   brings<br />       them<br />         back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>         It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up<br />   inside<br />       and<br />         outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town -<br />   just<br />         wonderful.</p>
<p>         Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />       samadhi<br />         which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every<br />   day.<br />         usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />       world<br />         paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in<br />   thiruvaiyaru.<br />         The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the<br />   day he<br />         attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>         Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />         Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms<br />   away<br />       from<br />         Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>         I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to<br />   our<br />         members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>      You are right about Ezhoor ( Seven Sapthasthanams) - it is called Ezhoor<br />      Sutruthal. Where we walk past the seven sapthasthanams.</p>

<p>    DEAR FRIENDS,</p>
<p>    LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai<br />    Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of<br />    Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the<br />    inscriptions :<br />    Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran<br />    maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL<br />    NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3. KIZHAR KOOTRATHU KUWAVAN KANCJAN &amp;     4.ACHARYAR ANIRUDHAR..</p>
<p>    The Pillars belonged to the Pidari temple constructed earlier by<br />    Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />    (Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />    =================<br />    We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in<br />    nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple.</p>
<p>    Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples)<br />    surrounding Thiruvaiyaru!</p>
<p>    -Fondly -sps<br />    ======================</p>
<p>    Yeah.. Thiruvedhikudi.</p>
<p>    thanks for correcting.</p>
<p>    regards / sps</p>
<p>    ------------------</p>
<p>      Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very<br />    unusual!<br />      so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu<br />    statues<br />      are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>      Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we<br />    have<br />      various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />      I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />      specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter how<br />    the<br />      day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />      Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my<br />    experience!)</p>
<p>e<br />    where<br />      I lived for about 22 years (90 % of my life time so far).</p>
<p>      Thanks a lot Sir.</p>

<p>        - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>        Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>        NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>        Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also<br />    known<br />        as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>        Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of<br />    Kollidam<br />        flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>        Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />        Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name<br />    Vadavaru.</p>
<p>        You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>        In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>        " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam<br />    during<br />        Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>        Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru!<br />    in<br />        Chapter 21.</p>
<p>        He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after<br />    crossing<br />        Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>        This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>        You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>    Vennaru -<br />        Vadavaru !</p>
<p>        VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>        RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>        Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam.. I have attended two / three<br />    times...<br />        Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>        You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />        AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>        Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>        Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>        Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />        Krishnaleelatharangani ...</p>
<p>        And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another<br />    one<br />        ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>        Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAM<br />    by<br />        Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />        Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>        Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here -<br />    prior to<br />        matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>        Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />        thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>        More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father<br />    as<br />thi<br />        vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>        Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>        " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every speciesin<br />    the<br />        world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>
<p>        wonderful temple !!</p>
<p>        thanks making us recall.</p>

<p>          Dear SPS,</p>
<p>          Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>          Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town<br />    (I<br />        come<br />          from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />          Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />        alone<br />          and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />        feels<br />          they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>          Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and<br />    Vetti<br />          ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and<br />    brings<br />        them<br />          back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>          It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up<br />    inside<br />        and<br />          outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town -<br />    just<br />          wonderful.</p>
<p>          Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />        samadhi<br />          which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every<br />    day.<br />          usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />        world<br />          paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in<br />    thiruvaiyaru.<br />          The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the<br />    day he<br />          attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>          Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />          Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms<br />    away<br />        from<br />          Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>          I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well knownto<br />    our<br />          members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>
<p>          Thanks and Regards,<br />          Narendran</p>

<p>            Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>            you are correct ..</p>
<p>            But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />            Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>
<p>            following link supports your view ::</p>

<p>            THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>            Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name<br />    by<br />            virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>            ------------<br />            The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar,<br />    Vettar<br />        and<br />            Kudamurutti.<br />            ---------</p>
<p>            The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief<br />    that to<br />        die<br />            here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />            Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the<br />    seven<br />            shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>            The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />        Thirupazhanam,<br />            Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />        carnatic<br />            music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />        celebration<br />            of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river<br />    Cauvery<br />        is<br />            well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over<br />    the<br />            country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every<br />    musician<br />        to<br />            hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />        Thiruvaiyaru<br />            on the occasion.</p>
<p>            In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a<br />    Poondi<br />        Matha<br />            Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />        River<br />            Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are<br />    visiting<br />        this<br />            shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The<br />        distance<br />            from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand<br />        Anicut to<br />            Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate<br />        every<br />            year from May 6th to 15th</p>
<p>            anbudan. sps</p>
<p>              -<br />              So fast... very good and thanks.</p>
<p>              Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru<br />            thalaippu).</p>
<p>              Arisalaru is to be included in its place.</p>

<p>  DEAR FRIENDS,</p>
<p>  LAST SUNDAY I HAD THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT Senthalai<br />  Temple -12 KMs West of (Tanjore) Thirukkandiyur - 6 Km East of<br />  Nemam - with Dr. Kudavoil Balu and saw the 4 pillars containing the<br />  inscriptions :<br />  Srimaran @ Chatrukesari @ Sri Kalwarkalvan @ Adhisahasan @ Suvaran<br />  maran @ PERUMBIDUGU MUTHARAYAN is praised by the Poets 1.PACHILVELL<br />  NAMBAN 2.KOTTATRU ILAMBERUMANAAR 3. KIZHAR KOOTRATHU KUWAVAN KANCJAN &amp;   4.ACHARYAR ANIRUDHAR..</p>
<p>  The Pillars belonged to the Pidari temple constructed earlier by<br />  Suvaran maran..before 775 AD<br />  (Also Ref: Epigraphia Indica Vol xiii pp 142)<br />  =================<br />  We have seen Vageesar in Thirukandiyur ( Not Brahma )and Manonmani in<br />  nearby Thiruvedhikudi temple.</p>
<p>  Thiruvedhikudi is one of the Sapthasthanams (7 temples)<br />  surrounding Thiruvaiyaru!</p>
<p>  -Fondly -sps<br />  ======================</p>
<p>  Yeah.. Thiruvedhikudi.</p>
<p>  thanks for correcting.</p>
<p>  regards / sps</p>
<p>  ------------------</p>
<p>    Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very<br />  unusual!<br />    so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu<br />  statues<br />    are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>    Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we<br />  have<br />    various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />    I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />    specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter how<br />  the<br />    day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />    Kaatchi time (I might sound a bit stupid here - but that was my<br />  experience!)</p>
<p>  where<br />    I lived for about 22 years (90 % of my life time so far).</p>
<p>    Thanks a lot Sir.</p>

<p>      - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>      Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>      NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>      Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also<br />  known<br />      as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>      Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of<br />  Kollidam<br />      flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>      Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />      Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name<br />  Vadavaru.</p>
<p>      You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>      In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>      " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam<br />  during<br />      Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>      Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru !<br />  in<br />      Chapter 21.</p>
<p>      He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after<br />  crossing<br />      Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>      This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>      You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>  Vennaru -<br />      Vadavaru !</p>
<p>      VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>      RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>      Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam.. I have attended two / three<br />  times...<br />      Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>      You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />      AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>      Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>      Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>      Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />      Krishnaleelatharangani ...</p>
<p>      And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another<br />  one<br />      ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>      Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAM<br />  by<br />      Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />      Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>      Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here -<br />  prior to<br />      matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>      Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />      thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>      More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father<br />  as<br />i<br />      vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>      Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>      " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species in<br />  the<br />      world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>
<p>      wonderful temple !!</p>

<p>        Dear SPS,</p>
<p>        Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>        Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town<br />  (I<br />      come<br />        from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />        Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />      alone<br />        and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />      feels<br />        they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>        Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and<br />  Vetti<br />        ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and<br />  brings<br />      them<br />        back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>        It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up<br />  inside<br />      and<br />        outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town -<br />  just<br />        wonderful.</p>
<p>        Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />      samadhi<br />        which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every<br />  day.<br />        usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />      world<br />        paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in<br />  thiruvaiyaru.<br />        The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the<br />  day he<br />        attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>        Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />        Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms<br />  away<br />      from<br />        Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>        I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to<br />  our<br />        members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>          THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>          Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name<br />  by<br />          virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>          ------------<br />          The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar,<br />  Vettar<br />      and<br />          Kudamurutti.<br />          ---------</p>
<p>          The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief<br />  that to<br />      die<br />          here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />          Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the<br />  seven<br />          shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>          The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />      Thirupazhanam,<br />          Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />      carnatic<br />          music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />      celebration<br />          of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river<br />  Cauvery<br />      is<br />          well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over<br />  the<br />          country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every<br />  musician<br />      to<br />          hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />      Thiruvaiyaru<br />          on the occasion.</p>
<p>          In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a<br />  Poondi<br />      Matha<br />          Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />      River<br />          Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are<br />  visiting<br />      this<br />          shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The<br />      distance<br />          from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand<br />      Anicut to<br />          Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate<br />      every<br />          year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>    Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>    Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>    Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />    Krishnaleelatharangani ...</p>
<p>    And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another one<br />    ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>    Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAMby<br />    Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />    Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>    Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here - prior to<br />    matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>    Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />    thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>    More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father as<br />    vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>    Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>    " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species in the<br />    world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>
<p>    wonderful temple !!</p>

<p>      Dear SPS,</p>
<p>      Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>      Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I<br />    come<br />      from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />      Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />    alone<br />      and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />    feels<br />      they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>      Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />      ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings<br />    them<br />      back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>      It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside<br />    and<br />      outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />      wonderful.</p>
<p>      Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />    samadhi<br />      which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />      usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />    world<br />      paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />      The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />      attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>      Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />      Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away<br />    from<br />      Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>      I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />      members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>
<p>      Thanks and Regards,<br />      Narendran</p>

<p>        Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>        you are correct ..</p>
<p>        But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />        Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>

<p>        THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>        Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />        virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>        ------------<br />        The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar<br />    and<br />        Kudamurutti.<br />        ---------</p>
<p>        The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />    die<br />        here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />        Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />        shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>        The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />    Thirupazhanam,<br />        Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />    carnatic<br />        music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />    celebration<br />        of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery<br />    is<br />        well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the<br />        country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician<br />    to<br />        hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />    Thiruvaiyaru<br />        on the occasion.</p>
<p>        In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />    Matha<br />        Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />    River<br />        Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting<br />    this<br />        shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The<br />    distance<br />        from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand<br />    Anicut to<br />        Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate<br />    every<br />        year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>          -<br />          So fast... very good and thanks.</p>
<p>          Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru<br />        thalaippu).</p>
<p>          Arisalaru is to be included in its place.</p>

<p>Dear Satheesh,</p>
<p>Several details are written in the temple ..</p>
<p>like Karikalan of 1st Century etc.. </p>
<p>Actually Karikalan is around mid 6th Century around 550 AD or so..</p>
<p>Agappey Siddhar is very important detail. </p>
<p>See whether you can elaborate on this in your blog.</p>
<p>Photos are very good.  </p>
<p>Have you included the photos of GREEN STONE PILLARS of NULAMBA ORIGIN (!?) in Then Kailsam ?</p>
<p>Supposed to be War-trophy by Rajendra I !</p>
<p>While discussed Sundara - Cheramanperumal subject - referring Travancore Archaelogical series - we brought out that Cauvery at Thirukandiyur- paved way for both of them to walk towards Thiruvaiyaru ! And that CP constructeda temple near his Capital in the same name of Thirukandiyur !</p>
<p>This is clearly shown in minature in the Periyapuranam series in Darasuram Airavatheswarar Temple !</p>

          5 Rivers - in Thiruvaiyaru        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear SPS,<br />Yes sir,<br />Sapthasthanam is one of the festivals which we localites expect with Zeak<br />and Enthusiasm,</p>
<p>You are right about Ezhoor ( Seven Sapthasthanams) - it is called Ezhoor<br />Sutruthal. Where we walk past the seven sapthasthanams.</p>
<p>the only correction is Thiruvethikudi.</p>
<p>Also in Kandiyur, there is a statue for Lord Brahma which is very unusual!<br />so it is one of the places where we have shivan, brahma and vishnu statues<br />are (a seperate vishnu temple is also there in thirukandiyur)</p>
<p>Apparku Kailai Kaatchi is still performed there and on top of that we have<br />various artists perform in the temple on that day.<br />I have attended that numerous times and spoke to a lot of people who<br />specifically comes to attend that from thirunelveli etc., no matter how the<br />day was we still get like few drops of rain during that Apparku Kailai<br />Kaatchi time (I might sound a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  stupid here - but that was my experience!)</p>
<p>I lived for about 22 years (90 % of my life time so far).</p>
<p>Thanks a lot Sir.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>  Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>  NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>  Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also known<br />  as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>  Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of Kollidam<br />  flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>  Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />  Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name Vadavaru.</p>
<p>  You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>  In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>  " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam during<br />  Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>  Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru ! in<br />  Chapter 21.</p>
<p>  He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after crossing<br />  Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>  This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>  You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>  Vadavaru !</p>
<p>  VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>  RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>  Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam.. I have attended two / three times...<br />  Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>  You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />  AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>  Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>  Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>  Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />  Krishnaleelatharangani ...</p>
<p>  And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another one<br />  ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>  Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAM by<br />  Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />  Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>  Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here - prior to<br />  matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>  Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />  thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>  More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father as<br />  vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>  Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>  " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species in the<br />  world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>
<p>  wonderful temple !!</p>
<p>  thanks making us recall.</p>

<p>    Dear SPS,</p>
<p>    Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>    Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I<br />  come<br />    from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />    Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)<br />  alone<br />    and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above<br />  feels<br />    they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>    Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />    ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings<br />  them<br />    back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>    It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside<br />  and<br />    outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />    wonderful.</p>
<p>    Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained<br />  samadhi<br />    which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />    usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the<br />  world<br />    paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />    The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />    attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>    Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />    Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away<br />  from<br />    Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>    I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />    members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>      Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>      you are correct ..</p>
<p>      But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />      Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>
<p>      following link supports your view ::</p>

<p>      THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>      Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />      virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>      ------------<br />      The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar<br />  and<br />      Kudamurutti.<br />      ---------</p>
<p>      The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />  die<br />      here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />      Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />      shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>      The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />  Thirupazhanam,<br />      Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />  carnatic<br />      music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />  celebration<br />      of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery<br />  is<br />      well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the<br />      country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician<br />  to<br />      hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />  Thiruvaiyaru<br />      on the occasion.</p>
<p>      In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />  Matha<br />      Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />  River<br />      Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting<br />  this<br />      shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The<br />  distance<br />      from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand<br />  Anicut to<br />      Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine celebrate<br />  every<br />      year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>        -<br />        So fast... very good and thanks.</p>
<p>        Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru<br />      thalaippu).</p>
<p>        Arisalaru is to be included in its place.</p>

<p>    Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name Vadavaru.</p>

<p>    He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after crossing Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !  </p>
<p>    This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>

<p>    RE THIRUVAIYARU : </p>
<p>    Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam.. I have attended two / three times... Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>    You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>    Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>    Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>    Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's Krishnaleelatharangani ... </p>

<p>      Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>      Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I come<br />      from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />      Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha)alone<br />      and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned abovefeels<br />      they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>      Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />      ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings them<br />      back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>      It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside and<br />      outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />      wonderful.</p>
<p>      Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained samadhi<br />      which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />      usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the world<br />      paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />      The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />      attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>      Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />      Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from<br />      Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>      I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />      members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

A celebration<br />        of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery is<br />        well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the<br />        country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician to<br />        hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of Thiruvaiyaru<br />        on the occasion.</p>
<p>        In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi Matha<br />        Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the River<br />        Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting this<br />        shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The distance<br />        from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand Anicut to<br />        Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM.

<p>    Dear SPS,</p>
<p>    Thanks for link sir.</p>
<p>    Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I come<br />    from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />    Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha) alone<br />    and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above feels<br />    they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>    Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />    ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings them<br />    back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>    It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside and<br />    outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />    wonderful.</p>
<p>    Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained samadhi<br />    which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />    usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the world<br />    paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />    The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />    attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>    Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />    Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from<br />    Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>    I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />    members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>     Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>     you are correct ..</p>
<p>     But Vadavar Thalaippu is from Anaikkarai only !!<br />     Even Kalki writes so.. !</p>
<p>     following link supports your view ::</p>

<p>     THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>     Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />     virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>     ------------<br />     The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar and<br />     Kudamurutti.<br />     ---------</p>
<p>     The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />     die here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />     Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />     shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>     The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />     Thirupazhanam, Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The<br />     great carnatic music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and diedhere.<br />     A celebration of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank ofriver<br />     Cauvery is well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all<br />     over the country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every<br />     musician to hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />     Thiruvaiyaru on the occasion.</p>
<p>     In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />     Matha Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />     River Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are<br />     visiting this shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre.<br />     The distance from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from<br />     Grand Anicut to Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine<br />     celebrate every year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>       Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru<br />     thalaippu).</p>
<p>       Arisalaru is to be included in its place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  - Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>  Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>  NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>  Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also known<br />  as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).</p>
<p>  Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of Kollidam<br />  flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>  Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at<br />  Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name Vadavaru.</p>
<p>  You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>  In fact I re-read PS again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>  " Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam during<br />  Aadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>  Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru ! in<br />  Chapter 21.</p>
<p>  He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after crossing<br />  Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>  This is the scenerio wherein our PS Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>  You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>  Vadavaru !</p>
<p>  VD received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>  RE THIRUVAIYARU :</p>
<p>  Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam.. I have attended two / three times...<br />  Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>  You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is<br />  AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>  Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>  Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>  Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's<br />  Krishnaleelatharangani ...</p>
<p>  And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another one<br />  ? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam !</p>
<p>  Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAM by<br />  Danthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />  Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>  Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o RRC - sought asylum here - prior to<br />  matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>  Other d/o RRC - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in<br />  thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>  More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father as<br />  vidangi survived RRC !</p>
<p>  Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>  " Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species in the<br />  world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " !</p>

<p>      The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />  die<br />      here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />      Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />      shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>      The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />  Thirupazhanam,<br />      Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The great<br />  carnatic<br />      music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here. A<br />  celebration<br />      of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river Cauvery<br />  is<br />      well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all over the<br />      country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every musician<br />  to<br />      hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />  Thiruvaiyaru<br />      on the occasion.</p>
<p>      In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />  Matha<br />      Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />  River<br />      Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are visiting<br />  this<br />      shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre. The<br />  distance<br />      from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from Grand<br />  Anicut to<br />      Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM.

          5 Rivers - in Thiruvaiyaru        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>- Dear Narendran,</p>
<p>Checked on the Vadavaru matter.</p>
<p>NORTHERN RIVER for THANJAI is also known as Vadavaru !</p>
<p>Northern RIVER CAUVERY &amp; KOLLIDAM - commencing at ANAIKKARAI is also known as VADAVARU (with a Thalaippu - beginning point ).  </p>
<p>Like Excess water of Cauvery flows into Kollidam, excess water of Kollidam flows into Vadavaru.</p>
<p>Since No kollidam is there near Thiruvaiyaru (we cross Kollidam at Thirumanur) on the way to Pazhuvur - I got confused with the name Vadavaru.</p>
<p>You are right about Arisalaru.. of course.!</p>
<p>In fact I re-read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  again today - a few Chapters !</p>
<p>" Vadavaru pongi varudhu " song by locals - on the bank of Veeranam duringAadiperukku ! Chapter 1.</p>
<p>Vandhiyathevan sees &amp; talks with Kundavai on the banks of Arisalaru ! in Chapter 21.</p>
<p>He crosses Pazhuvur Ilayarani Nandhini - closer to Thanjai - after crossing Cauvery and other 4 rivers from Thiruvaiyaru !  </p>
<p>This is the scenerio wherein our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Trailor team needed the names.</p>
<p>You have provided them very rightly ..</p>
<p>Vadavaru !</p>
<p><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  received the PANAI TREE ring from Nandhini here only !!</p>
<p>RE THIRUVAIYARU : </p>
<p>Wonderful to recall Sapthasthanam.. I have attended two / three times... Colourful pallakku !</p>
<p>You may also know that like Thiruvaiyaru Sapthasthanam - there is AYYAMPETTAI SAPTHASTHANAM also !!</p>
<p>Thillaisthanam reminds me of Thi.Sa.Raaju - very reknowned writer.</p>
<p>Thiruchotruthurai - Annapoorni temple !</p>
<p>Thriuppoonduruthi - Uzhavarappani by Appar... Narayana theerthar's Krishnaleelatharangani ... </p>
<p>And of course Thirukkandiyur - thiruppazhanam ! Thiruvelvigudi another one? There is a rare MANONMANI sculpture in the Vimanam ! </p>
<p>Thiruvaiyaru - Inside Ayyarappan temple complex there are THEN KAILASAM byDanthisakthividangi and VADA KAILASAM by Rajendra !<br />Highly informative historically.</p>
<p>Chalukya Vimaladithan H/o kundhavai d/o <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  - sought asylum here - prior to matrimonial relationship !</p>
<p>Other d/o <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  - Madhevadigal figures only in 2 inscriptions - one in thiruvalanchuzhi and other in Thiruvaiyaru !</p>
<p>More interestingly in the 4th year of Rajendra - he denotes his father as Pngi survived <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  !</p>
<p>Kailsakkatchi for Appar, Sundarar !!</p>
<p>" Kadhal madappidi yanai ... " very famous Thevaram ! Every species in the world looked in PAIR - " kandariyadhana kanden " ! </p>
<p>wonderful temple !!</p>
<p>thanks making us recall.</p>

<p>  Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I come<br />  from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />  Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha) alone<br />  and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above feels<br />  they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
<p>  Iyyarappan now feels bad and hence builds two pallakku (Kannadi and Vetti<br />  ver) and goes to the six sapthasthanams to pacify the lords and brings them<br />  back to the temple and that marks the end of the festival.</p>
<p>  It is a colorful festival with Ther, pallakku, new shops set up inside and<br />  outside the temple and thousands of people gathering in the town - just<br />  wonderful.</p>
<p>  Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained samadhi<br />  which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />  usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the world<br />  paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />  The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />  attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>  Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />  Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from<br />  Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>  I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />  members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>

<p>  Thiyagaraja aradhana is celebrated on the day Thiyagaraja attained samadhi<br />  which usually falls on the third or the last week of January every day.<br />  usually it will be a 5 or 6 days festival with musicans all over the world<br />  paying homage to Thiaygaraja by singing his kritis alone in thiruvaiyaru.<br />  The pancha rathna kritis by lord thiyagaraja will sung only on the day he<br />  attained samadhi (Pushya bahula panchami).</p>
<p>  Last to mention One of the nava graha temples is very close to<br />  Thiruvaiyaru.Chandran temple which is in Thingaloor is just 3 kms away from<br />  Thiruvaiyaru.</p>
<p>  I am pretty sure most of the information above are all well known to our<br />  members - I just got carried away speaking about my home town!</p>
<p>  Thanks and Regards,<br />  Narendran</p>

<p>   THIRUVAIYARU TALUK</p>
<p>   Thiruvaiyaru means five holy rivers and this town derives its name by<br />   virtue of the five rivers flow within 5 km of this town.</p>
<p>   ------------<br />   The name of the rivers apart from Cauvery are Vadavar, Vennar, Vettar and<br />   Kudamurutti.<br />   ---------</p>
<p>   The town is considered as holy as Varanasi and ther is a belief that to<br />   die here is an eternal blessing leading to salvation. The temple of<br />   Panchanathiswara in this town is considered as the first of the seven<br />   shrines called Sapthasthanams</p>
<p>   The other six Sapthasthanam are Kandiyur, Thiruppanthuruthi,<br />   Thirupazhanam, Thiruvedhikudi, Thillaisthanam and Thiruchotruthurai. The<br />   great carnatic music composer and Saint Sri Thiyagaraja lived and died here.<br />   A celebration of annual musical festival at his samadhi on the bank of river<br />   Cauvery is well known and is attended by thousands of musicians from all<br />   over the country by considering it as a honour and priviledge of every<br />   musician to hymn Pancharathnakrithis of Saint Thiagaraja in the streets of<br />   Thiruvaiyaru on the occasion.</p>
<p>   In between Thiruvaiyaru and Grand Anaicut Main Road there is a Poondi<br />   Matha Shrine at Alamelupuram Poondi village it is located in between the<br />   River Cauvery and Coleroon. Just like Velankanni, No.of pilgrims are<br />   visiting this shrine and it became a world famous miracular pilgrim centre.<br />   The distance from Thiruvaiyaru to Alamelupuram Poondi is 20 KM. and from<br />   Grand Anicut to Alamelupuram Poondi is 15 KM. The Festival of this shrine<br />   celebrate every year from May 6th to 15th</p>

<p>     Vadavaru is from anaikkarai towards Veeranam (known as Vadavaru<br />   thalaippu).</p>

<p>Sapthasthanam - It is a famous Chitthirai festival in our home town (I come<br />from thiruvaiyaru and my parents live there).<br />Lord Iyyarapan (Panchanatheesvarar) goes on the Car (ther thiruvizha) alone<br />and hence the other lords from the six sapthasthanams mentioned above feels<br />they were not given enough respect and goes back to their home.</p>
