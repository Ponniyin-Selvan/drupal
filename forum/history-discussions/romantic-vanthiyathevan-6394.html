<p>vanthiyathevan- manimekalai<br />vanthiyathevan- kunthavai<br />vanthiyathevan- nandini<br />vanthiyathevan- pungkuzhali<br />vanthiyathevan had the best chance of a romance with manimekalai. she <br />loved him truly. but he is sort of releived when maran tells him she <br />is to be married off to somebody else.<br />kunthavai and nandini vanthiyathevan meets one after another. he is <br />dazzled.<br />the puzzling thing however is that he proposes to pungkuzhali after <br />this.<br />your comments please.....</p>

<p>    a sample exchange between me and dhiwaker.<br />    there are many between him and muruganandam( biographer of feroze <br />    gandhi) between him and nadarajan srinivasan etc</p>
<p>  Talking of Muruganandam, where is he, not to be seen in the group?<br />  Murugs are you so busy?</p>
<p>  And this Diwakar and Murugs used to fool the entire group. They will<br />  call each other and decide on a topic, one will shoot a mail on <br />that,<br />  and the other will argue against that. Naturally two groups will <br />form<br />  and they will sit back and enjoy.. :) we came to know about this <br />only<br />  quite later... :) memorable days.</p>

        <p>Also to remember, people who grow up in the wilderness dont' have the <br />same social skills as people who grow up in cities and other socially <br />close knit environment. On the other hand they develop great skills <br />that are otherwise impossible for those who are socially adept. It <br />takes a Poonguzhali to take a ferry across stormy sea and kill a <br />leapard bare handed. I think it is really unfair to think she <br />lacked 'kudumba paangu' while she had so many outstanding skills. </p>

<p>    apologies :) but you cant have the cake and <br />    eat <br />      it also, you can't ask for a strong woman and then complain <br />      about 'kudumba paangu'. But she was a strong woman and if we <br />  extend <br />      into Kalki's imagination I bet she made a pretty strong queen <br />  later<br />    :)</p>
<p>      Vanadhi, yes definitely nadagam case dhan, sila samayam konjum <br />      pavamagavum irukkum. Kalki introduces her as a moody woman <br />often <br />      times depressed also, so the fainting may not be always <br />nadagam. <br />    Also <br />      many woman have to resort to nadagam among others who do not <br />take <br />      them seriously. So definitely somewhat irritating since we <br />dont' <br />    know <br />      what she is upto and definitely not queen material.</p>
<p>      VD I agree with every word although we have to see the <br />innocence <br />  at <br />      times behind the sapattu raman and skirt lover :))</p>

<p>        VD - saappattu raman. Quotes the scene when he eats at SA's <br />  house.<br />        paniyaram. He is landless prince, only with his past fame. So <br />    wants <br />      to<br />        settle in a royal place so that he need not bother about next <br />  time<br />        food. Kundavai was the right choice, because for her <br />character <br />  she<br />        will not leave the royal palace of chola's even after <br />marriage. <br />    So <br />      he<br />        can happily settle with her. </p>
<p>        I forgot for what he used this phrase 'why blood, same blood' <br />  but <br />    it<br />        was really hilarious. came out during the return trip from <br />  Tanjai.</p>
<p>        Dont remember the rest.</p>
<p>        These three, I remember well for its depth. Poonguzhali - <br />    Natarajan<br />        Srinivasan and Diwakar used to fight a lot. VD - cant miss <br />for <br />      saapatu<br />        raman comment. And nadagal mayil for vanathi was a phenomenal <br />    phrase<br />        which we seldom use these days.</p>

        <p>Satish, I know hard core adventurers who are not televised, they do <br />talk, all the time, to trees, mountains, everything. Even people who <br />live in remote areas (there are lots of people like that in US) do <br />that type of talking. People with psychic abilities even get messages <br />from nature like that. </p>
<p>Talking to the audience is not the same as that, most of the time it <br />is not even verbal just under the breath murmuring.</p>

<p>Talking of Muruganandam, where is he, not to be seen in the group?<br />Murugs are you so busy?</p>
<p>And this Diwakar and Murugs used to fool the entire group. They will<br />call each other and decide on a topic, one will shoot a mail on that,<br />and the other will argue against that. Naturally two groups will form<br />and they will sit back and enjoy.. :) we came to know about this only<br />quite later... :) memorable days.</p>

<p>Whatever we see in TV are not real. Everything is directed and edited.<br />And we should remember that even in the remotest place such<br />adventurers go, atleast the cameraman is with them if not for the<br />crew. So they are never alone.To digress- while watching such<br />programs, I admire the cameraman more than the actual person, because,<br />the main person has only one task to do, maybe go through some<br />impossible trial, but the cameraman has to go through the impossible<br />trial along with the camera (hifi camera's are surely heavy) and they<br />dont talk to trees or themselves as a strategy but its their dialogue<br />to the audience.</p>

        <p>Also Venkat I agree 100% that Kalki did not know what to do with her, <br />same as with Nandhini. As you have told several times since he did <br />not write the novel as a stretch and publish it he did not have a <br />chance to rewrite anything and lots of loose ends.</p>
<p>That is all the more reason why I regard <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  as his best work, or even <br /><acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym . Would be great to talk more on Parthiban Kanavu, not much <br />discussion on that?</acronym></acronym></p>

<p>    no way malathi.<br />    she definitely had some psychological problems.<br />    the night walking, talking to the methane flares in the swamp <br />    etc.imagining them as her lovers too.<br />    she does show some maturity later when she stands up to the prime <br />    minister himself.<br />    and also I am answering for another mail. by 'hot potato' i meant <br />  for <br />    the author. juggling the charecter because shes too hot to hold.</p>

<p>    apologies :) but you cant have the cake and <br />    eat <br />      it also, you can't ask for a strong woman and then complain <br />      about 'kudumba paangu'. But she was a strong woman and if we <br />  extend <br />      into Kalki's imagination I bet she made a pretty strong queen <br />  later<br />    :)</p>
<p>      Vanadhi, yes definitely nadagam case dhan, sila samayam konjum <br />      pavamagavum irukkum. Kalki introduces her as a moody woman <br />often <br />      times depressed also, so the fainting may not be always <br />nadagam. <br />    Also <br />      many woman have to resort to nadagam among others who do not <br />take <br />      them seriously. So definitely somewhat irritating since we <br />dont' <br />    know <br />      what she is upto and definitely not queen material.</p>

<p>        VD - saappattu raman. Quotes the scene when he eats at SA's <br />  house.<br />        paniyaram. He is landless prince, only with his past fame. So <br />    wants <br />      to<br />        settle in a royal place so that he need not bother about next <br />  time<br />        food. Kundavai was the right choice, because for her <br />character <br />  she<br />        will not leave the royal palace of chola's even after <br />marriage. <br />    So <br />      he<br />        can happily settle with her. </p>
<p>        I forgot for what he used this phrase 'why blood, same blood' <br />  but <br />    it<br />        was really hilarious. came out during the return trip from <br />  Tanjai.</p>
<p>        Dont remember the rest.</p>
<p>        These three, I remember well for its depth. Poonguzhali - <br />    Natarajan<br />        Srinivasan and Diwakar used to fight a lot. VD - cant miss <br />for <br />      saapatu<br />        raman comment. And nadagal mayil for vanathi was a phenomenal <br />    phrase<br />        which we seldom use these days.</p>

        <p>Venkat, truly fascinating. Some thoughts - <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  could have married <br />Manimekalai after marrying Kundavai. I am not sure Kundavai would <br />have had any objections as long as she was the chief queen.The <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  in <br />reality did have more than one wife, am I correct?</acronym></acronym></p>
<p><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  was a survivor, that includes sappadu as you point out other <br />things necessary for survival. Love was great but secondary to <br />survival. That might be a little dry and make him look less <br />attractive but in a time when all kings married to maintain dominion <br />integrity and peace it is not an abnormal/unusual thing. </acronym></p>
<p>Lastly, it is very rare to this day that a confident self assured man <br />finds a totally worshipping woman attractive. Same thing with <br />Narasimha and Vanamahadevi, while he respects her attraction, the <br />fire and passion he shared with Sivakami was clearly missing. <br />Manimekalai's problem was that she was a Vanamahadevi like <br />worshipper, willing to go to any lengths to marry him and blind to <br />anything he did. It is hard to refuse, that too from a princess so he <br />relents a while. I would forgive him if he did not find that to be <br />very attractive over time.</p>

        <p>Got you Venkat, on the hot potato. Regarding talking to flares, that <br />is actually a common strategy among great adventurists to this day to <br />ward off fear in unknown/scary terrains.

<p>  apologies :) but you cant have the cake and <br />  eat <br />    it also, you can't ask for a strong woman and then complain <br />    about 'kudumba paangu'. But she was a strong woman and if we <br />extend <br />    into Kalki's imagination I bet she made a pretty strong queen <br />later<br />  :)</p>
<p>    Vanadhi, yes definitely nadagam case dhan, sila samayam konjum <br />    pavamagavum irukkum. Kalki introduces her as a moody woman often <br />    times depressed also, so the fainting may not be always nadagam. <br />  Also <br />    many woman have to resort to nadagam among others who do not take <br />    them seriously. So definitely somewhat irritating since we dont' <br />  know <br />    what she is upto and definitely not queen material.</p>

        <p>Yes Manimekalai's love was onesided but true. She had been hearing about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  from an young age through KM , infact KM was the match maker in this love till he turned against it due to political reasons. Having believed <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  to be her man from an young age she just couldn't accept any other proposal &amp; went to the extent of owning up AK's murder to protect her man. Kalki really gave her an honorable place in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .<br />Shobha</acronym></p>

<p>    not vith vd kunthavai's wedding or coronation of amv.</p>
<p>    in my opinion she is an odd woman too, somewhat <br />      irritating (to me). She has a huge crush on VD and ultimately <br />  dies <br />      for him. (Love that is not reciprocated is a crush). She is <br />    talented, <br />      intelligent, beautiful, i mean if not VD so what she would have <br />  had <br />      lots of others...atleast RRC I can understand the guy was a <br />  prince <br />      and lots of women fall for princes..but VD I really dont'<br />know, <br />  he <br />    is <br />      not exactly made out to be a lady killer and why this female <br />      sacrified herself for him.</p>

<p>            Venkat, am not sure if Poonguzhali was a 'hot potato'.<br />        Poonguzhali is<br />            the essential high achieveing strong woman who makes men<br />  feel<br />            guilty/less brave/less achieving and that is often<br />  manifested<br />      in<br />            their desire to marry her (and therefore gain control).<br />  VD's<br />        proposal<br />            to her was not out of love but more out of guilt while a<br />        fisherwoman<br />            can be so brave and strong what does that make of him? And<br />  AM<br />      of<br />            course wants his bride to be like his great sister even if<br />    she<br />        does<br />            not think likewise.

<p>            To me Poonguzhali's character is more realistic than all<br />  the<br />        other<br />            women and she gets full marks as a person. VD is the<br />  typical<br />        youthful<br />            romantically confused young man who is attracted to several<br />      women<br />          but<br />            ultimately settles for what is most convenient, good for<br />  his<br />            career/friendship and esteem.

<p>  not vith vd kunthavai's wedding or coronation of amv.</p>
<p>  in my opinion she is an odd woman too, somewhat<br />    irritating (to me). She has a huge crush on VD and ultimately dies<br />    for him. (Love that is not reciprocated is a crush). She is<br />  talented,<br />    intelligent, beautiful, i mean if not VD so what she would have had<br />    lots of others...atleast RRC I can understand the guy was a prince<br />    and lots of women fall for princes..but VD I really dont' know, he<br />  is<br />    not exactly made out to be a lady killer and why this female<br />    sacrified herself for him.</p>

<p>        Venkat, am not sure if Poonguzhali was a 'hot potato'.<br />    Poonguzhali is<br />        the essential high achieveing strong woman who makes men feel<br />        guilty/less brave/less achieving and that is often manifested<br />  in<br />        their desire to marry her (and therefore gain control). VD's<br />    proposal<br />        to her was not out of love but more out of guilt while a<br />    fisherwoman<br />        can be so brave and strong what does that make of him? And AM<br />  of<br />        course wants his bride to be like his great sister even if she<br />    does<br />        not think likewise. SA to me is the female in the relationship,<br />    which<br />        happens a lot in real life too.</p>
<p>        To me Poonguzhali's character is more realistic than all the<br />    other<br />        women and she gets full marks as a person. VD is the typical<br />    youthful<br />        romantically confused young man who is attracted to several<br />  women<br />      but<br />        ultimately settles for what is most convenient, good for his<br />        career/friendship and esteem.

<p>  vd talks so much about the lost glory of his kingdom that his love<br />  for kunthavai comes under suspicion. kunthavai also talks about not<br />  leaving the chola kingdom after marriage.</p>
<p>  pungkuzhali and her insistence on marrying an emperor only also to<br />  be viewed.</p>
<p>  vanathi and her uncles demanding that she be married to amv also<br />  raises the doubt.<br />  perhaps the only true love of PS manimekalai was one sided and did<br />  not succeed.</p>

<p>      not vith vd kunthavai's wedding or coronation of amv.</p>
<p>      in my opinion she is an odd woman too, somewhat<br />        irritating (to me). She has a huge crush on VD and ultimately<br />    dies<br />        for him. (Love that is not reciprocated is a crush). She is<br />      talented,<br />        intelligent, beautiful, i mean if not VD so what she would have<br />    had<br />        lots of others...atleast RRC I can understand the guy was a<br />    prince<br />        and lots of women fall for princes..but VD I really dont' know,<br />    he<br />      is<br />        not exactly made out to be a lady killer and why this female<br />        sacrified herself for him.</p>

<p>            Venkat, am not sure if Poonguzhali was a 'hot potato'.<br />        Poonguzhali is<br />            the essential high achieveing strong woman who makes men<br />  feel<br />            guilty/less brave/less achieving and that is often<br />  manifested<br />      in<br />            their desire to marry her (and therefore gain control).<br />  VD's<br />        proposal<br />            to her was not out of love but more out of guilt while a<br />        fisherwoman<br />            can be so brave and strong what does that make of him? And<br />  AM<br />      of<br />            course wants his bride to be like his great sister even if<br />    she<br />        does<br />            not think likewise. SA to me is the female in the<br />    relationship,<br />        which<br />            happens a lot in real life too.</p>
<p>            To me Poonguzhali's character is more realistic than all<br />  the<br />        other<br />            women and she gets full marks as a person. VD is the<br />  typical<br />        youthful<br />            romantically confused young man who is attracted to several<br />      women<br />          but<br />            ultimately settles for what is most convenient, good for<br />  his<br />            career/friendship and esteem. Just two cents.</p>

<p>pungkuzhali and senthan amudhan<br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  and kunthavai<br />amv and vanathi</acronym></p>
<p>all have a subtle political or personal angle to it</p>
<p><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  talks so much about the lost glory of his kingdom that his love <br />for kunthavai comes under suspicion. kunthavai also talks about not <br />leaving the chola kingdom after marriage.</acronym></p>
<p>pungkuzhali and her insistence on marrying an emperor only also to <br />be viewed.</p>
<p>vanathi and her uncles demanding that she be married to amv also <br />raises the doubt.<br />perhaps the only true love of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  manimekalai was one sided and did <br />not succeed.</acronym></p>

<p>          Venkat, am not sure if Poonguzhali was a 'hot potato'. <br />      Poonguzhali is <br />          the essential high achieveing strong woman who makes men <br />feel <br />          guilty/less brave/less achieving and that is often <br />manifested <br />    in <br />          their desire to marry her (and therefore gain control). <br />VD's <br />      proposal <br />          to her was not out of love but more out of guilt while a <br />      fisherwoman <br />          can be so brave and strong what does that make of him? And <br />AM <br />    of <br />          course wants his bride to be like his great sister even if <br />  she <br />      does <br />          not think likewise. SA to me is the female in the <br />  relationship, <br />      which <br />          happens a lot in real life too.</p>
<p>          To me Poonguzhali's character is more realistic than all <br />the <br />      other <br />          women and she gets full marks as a person. VD is the <br />typical <br />      youthful <br />          romantically confused young man who is attracted to several <br />    women <br />        but <br />          ultimately settles for what is most convenient, good for <br />his <br />          career/friendship and esteem. Just two cents.</p>

VD is the typical <br />    youthful <br />        romantically confused young man who is attracted to several <br />  women <br />      but <br />        ultimately settles for what is most convenient, good for his <br />        career/friendship and esteem.

<p>aditya karikalan and maduranthakan both direct heirs to the chola <br />throne.<br />she still thinks about vanthiyathevan wastes away and dies. kalki <br />must have thought highest of her to finish his novel with her death.</p>
<p>not vith vd kunthavai's wedding or coronation of amv.</p>
<p>in my opinion she is an odd woman too, somewhat </p>
<blockquote><p>  irritating (to me). She has a huge crush on VD and ultimately dies <br />  for him. (Love that is not reciprocated is a crush). She is <br />talented, <br />  intelligent, beautiful, i mean if not VD so what she would have had <br />  lots of others...atleast RRC I can understand the guy was a prince <br />  and lots of women fall for princes..but VD I really dont' know, he <br />is <br />  not exactly made out to be a lady killer and why this female <br />  sacrified herself for him.</p>

<p>    Thanks Satish. I definitely disagree on Pooguzhali, seems like a <br />    classic male comment, apologies :) but you cant have the cake and <br />  eat <br />    it also, you can't ask for a strong woman and then complain <br />    about 'kudumba paangu'. But she was a strong woman and if we <br />extend <br />    into Kalki's imagination I bet she made a pretty strong queen <br />  later :)</p>
<p>    Vanadhi, yes definitely nadagam case dhan, sila samayam konjum <br />    pavamagavum irukkum. Kalki introduces her as a moody woman often <br />    times depressed also, so the fainting may not be always nadagam. <br />  Also <br />    many woman have to resort to nadagam among others who do not take <br />    them seriously. So definitely somewhat irritating since we dont' <br />  know <br />    what she is upto and definitely not queen material.</p>

<p>      Vanathi - nadaga mayil. acted very well in front of AM and avana<br />      kauthitta..</p>
<p>      VD - saappattu raman. Quotes the scene when he eats at SA's <br />house.<br />      paniyaram. He is landless prince, only with his past fame. So <br />  wants <br />    to<br />      settle in a royal place so that he need not bother about next <br />time<br />      food. Kundavai was the right choice, because for her character <br />she<br />      will not leave the royal palace of chola's even after marriage. <br />  So <br />    he<br />      can happily settle with her. </p>
<p>      I forgot for what he used this phrase 'why blood, same blood' <br />but <br />  it<br />      was really hilarious. came out during the return trip from <br />Tanjai.</p>
<p>      Dont remember the rest.</p>
<p>      These three, I remember well for its depth. Poonguzhali - <br />  Natarajan<br />      Srinivasan and Diwakar used to fight a lot. VD - cant miss for <br />    saapatu<br />      raman comment. And nadagal mayil for vanathi was a phenomenal <br />  phrase<br />      which we seldom use these days.</p>

        <p>Venkat, does your Kaviri Maindhan have Poonguzhali and how does her <br />character develop? Am curious.. :))</p>

<blockquote><p>  Thanks Satish. I definitely disagree on Pooguzhali, seems like a <br />  classic male comment, apologies :) but you cant have the cake and <br />eat <br />  it also, you can't ask for a strong woman and then complain <br />  about 'kudumba paangu'. But she was a strong woman and if we extend <br />  into Kalki's imagination I bet she made a pretty strong queen <br />later :)</p>
<p>  Vanadhi, yes definitely nadagam case dhan, sila samayam konjum <br />  pavamagavum irukkum. Kalki introduces her as a moody woman often <br />  times depressed also, so the fainting may not be always nadagam. <br />Also <br />  many woman have to resort to nadagam among others who do not take <br />  them seriously. So definitely somewhat irritating since we dont' <br />know <br />  what she is upto and definitely not queen material.</p>
<p>  VD I agree with every word although we have to see the innocence at <br />  times behind the sapattu raman and skirt lover :))</p>

<p>    Vanathi - nadaga mayil. acted very well in front of AM and avana<br />    kauthitta..</p>
<p>    VD - saappattu raman. Quotes the scene when he eats at SA's house.<br />    paniyaram. He is landless prince, only with his past fame. So <br />wants <br />  to<br />    settle in a royal place so that he need not bother about next time<br />    food. Kundavai was the right choice, because for her character she<br />    will not leave the royal palace of chola's even after marriage. <br />So <br />  he<br />    can happily settle with her. </p>
<p>    I forgot for what he used this phrase 'why blood, same blood' but <br />it<br />    was really hilarious. came out during the return trip from Tanjai.</p>
<p>    Dont remember the rest.</p>
<p>    These three, I remember well for its depth. Poonguzhali - <br />Natarajan<br />    Srinivasan and Diwakar used to fight a lot. VD - cant miss for <br />  saapatu<br />    raman comment. And nadagal mayil for vanathi was a phenomenal <br />phrase<br />    which we seldom use these days.</p>

<p>            Venkat, am not sure if Poonguzhali was a 'hot potato'. <br />        Poonguzhali is <br />            the essential high achieveing strong woman who makes men <br />  feel <br />            guilty/less brave/less achieving and that is often <br />manifested <br />    in <br />            their desire to marry her (and therefore gain control). <br />VD's <br />        proposal <br />            to her was not out of love but more out of guilt while a <br />        fisherwoman <br />            can be so brave and strong what does that make of him? <br />And <br />  AM <br />      of <br />            course wants his bride to be like his great sister even <br />if <br />    she <br />        does <br />            not think likewise. SA to me is the female in the <br />    relationship, <br />        which <br />            happens a lot in real life too.</p>
<p>            To me Poonguzhali's character is more realistic than all <br />the <br />        other <br />            women and she gets full marks as a person. VD is the <br />typical <br />        youthful <br />            romantically confused young man who is attracted to <br />several <br />      women <br />          but <br />            ultimately settles for what is most convenient, good for <br />his <br />            career/friendship and esteem. Just two cents.</p>

<p>          Venkat, am not sure if Poonguzhali was a 'hot potato'. <br />      Poonguzhali is <br />          the essential high achieveing strong woman who makes men <br />feel <br />          guilty/less brave/less achieving and that is often manifested <br />  in <br />          their desire to marry her (and therefore gain control). VD's <br />      proposal <br />          to her was not out of love but more out of guilt while a <br />      fisherwoman <br />          can be so brave and strong what does that make of him? And <br />AM <br />    of <br />          course wants his bride to be like his great sister even if <br />  she <br />      does <br />          not think likewise.

<p>          To me Poonguzhali's character is more realistic than all the <br />      other <br />          women and she gets full marks as a person. VD is the typical <br />      youthful <br />          romantically confused young man who is attracted to several <br />    women <br />        but <br />          ultimately settles for what is most convenient, good for his <br />          career/friendship and esteem.

<p>      Venkat, am not sure if Poonguzhali was a 'hot potato'. <br />  Poonguzhali is <br />      the essential high achieveing strong woman who makes men feel <br />      guilty/less brave/less achieving and that is often manifested in <br />      their desire to marry her (and therefore gain control). VD's <br />  proposal <br />      to her was not out of love but more out of guilt while a <br />  fisherwoman <br />      can be so brave and strong what does that make of him? And AM <br />of <br />      course wants his bride to be like his great sister even if she <br />  does <br />      not think likewise. SA to me is the female in the relationship, <br />  which <br />      happens a lot in real life too.</p>
<p>      To me Poonguzhali's character is more realistic than all the <br />  other <br />      women and she gets full marks as a person. VD is the typical <br />  youthful <br />      romantically confused young man who is attracted to several <br />women <br />    but <br />      ultimately settles for what is most convenient, good for his <br />      career/friendship and esteem.

        <p>Thanks Satish. I definitely disagree on Pooguzhali, seems like a <br />classic male comment, apologies :) but you cant have the cake and eat <br />it also, you can't ask for a strong woman and then complain <br />about 'kudumba paangu'. But she was a strong woman and if we extend <br />into Kalki's imagination I bet she made a pretty strong queen later :)</p>
<p>Vanadhi, yes definitely nadagam case dhan, sila samayam konjum <br />pavamagavum irukkum. Kalki introduces her as a moody woman often <br />times depressed also, so the fainting may not be always nadagam. Also <br />many woman have to resort to nadagam among others who do not take <br />them seriously. So definitely somewhat irritating since we dont' know <br />what she is upto and definitely not queen material.</p>

<p>    Hi Malathi</p>
<p>    you sound just like diwaker basker of yester years in our group.<br />    he always used to say vanthiyathevan settled with kundavai <br />because <br />  it <br />    solved his "food problem"</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Venkat, am not sure if Poonguzhali was a 'hot potato'. Poonguzhali is <br />the essential high achieveing strong woman who makes men feel <br />guilty/less brave/less achieving and that is often manifested in <br />their desire to marry her (and therefore gain control). <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym 's proposal <br />to her was not out of love but more out of guilt while a fisherwoman <br />can be so brave and strong what does that make of him? And AM of <br />course wants his bride to be like his great sister even if she does <br />not think likewise. SA to me is the female in the relationship, which <br />happens a lot in real life too.</acronym></p>
<p>To me Poonguzhali's character is more realistic than all the other <br />women and she gets full marks as a person. <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  is the typical youthful <br />romantically confused young man who is attracted to several women but <br />ultimately settles for what is most convenient, good for his <br />career/friendship and esteem. Just two cents.</acronym></p>

        <p>very true. Poonguzhali's character was a very intresting one from the<br />begining. But once she agrees to marry Sendan... buss nu pochu...<br />I too felt that kalki could have handled her character better towards the<br />end. As for Vandhiyathevan.. he is a true romantic dooesnt leave a chance to<br />flirt with any women ;) But his true love was only for Kundhavai which has<br />been portrayed really well by kalki. Whenever he is into any precarious<br />situation like the cyclone or death of AK, his main thot would revolve<br />around Kundavai only.</p>
