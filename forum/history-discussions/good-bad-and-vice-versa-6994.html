I certainly don't and have seen others like <br />that <br />  also. Please try to acknowledge that even if you dont agree.</p>

<p>        Ravi, I just took one meaning of tiger, which is warrior <br />  spirit, <br />        Durga riding tiger is intended as warrior spirit in some <br />        interpretations. I do agree with your interpretation also.</p>
<p>        If you belive Ayyappa really rode a tiger that is fine, there <br />  are <br />        many of us who believe but we cannot talk like our beliefs <br />are <br />      facts. <br />        It does not necesarily mean the opposite - that they are <br />lies, <br />    but <br />        not physical historical facts unless we know for sure. When <br />we <br />    are <br />        talking of religious topics it makes sense to bring this in <br />and <br />    not <br />        specify the same but while discussing history or literature <br />it <br />    gets <br />        confusing that is all since history is not totally beleif and <br />        literature is related to story.</p>

<p>          Malathi: There is more to Tiger and related lines in <br />  spiritual <br />        realms <br />          though I am not sure about warrior spirit. Tiger is a <br />      significance <br />        of <br />          lust and Shiva seated on it is said to have won over lust. <br />    Tiger <br />        skin <br />          is very static has potential of attracting cosmic energy.</p>
<p>          However, WRT to this thread, I believe in reality, Ayyapa <br />was <br />    an <br />          incarnate who rode a tiger, that is again not something <br />which <br />    is <br />        not <br />          possible. Sheer muscle power is not needed to over power <br />    animals, <br />        be <br />          it a dog or an elephant, they can be controlled by the mind <br />  and <br />      not <br />          by muscle. I am to believe that when He 'talks' to them, <br />they <br />        listen.</p>

Most <br />  people <br />          talking <br />            about myths versus history versus legends is a dead end <br />          conversation <br />            since it upsets their religious sentiments to even <br />discuss <br />  it.</p>
<p>            I will just explain what I understand. I don't believe <br />  myths <br />      are <br />          lies <br />            as commonly said. A myth is an allegorical truth, not a <br />        historical <br />            one. Historical truths are factual. Myths may or may not <br />  have <br />          origins <br />            in history - the meaning of myth is metaphysical and it <br />is <br />      never <br />            intended to be a factual truth.</p>
<p>            Ayyappa riding a tiger may or may not be factual. Tiger <br />        represents <br />            warrior spirit/consciousness. The Divine God riding it <br />      represents <br />          the <br />            surrender of that consciousness to Divine Will. To me <br />that <br />      makes <br />          much <br />            better sense than making a macho guy of 14 year old <br />Ayyappa <br />            conquering tiger.</p>
<p>            Very humble Two cents,</p>

        <p>Ravi, just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym , the Bible has stories of humans overpowering *hungry* <br />lions and tigers by power of spirit. Maybe possible, nobody denied. I <br />am just request you to consider a perspective where people may not <br />want to mix Ayyappa and Kumaragurupana with kings and queens alike <br />for various reasons. I certainly don't and have seen others like that <br />also. Please try to acknowledge that even if you dont agree.</acronym></p>

        <p>VJ: Interesting read, if I understand it right, the author suggests <br />that Ayyapa could be a Buddhist deity.</p>
<p>I think its the way the author looked at it, there are genuine holes <br />in analysis, for example, the similarities in the chants Swamiye <br />sarnam etc, I am positive that the saranam lingo is common to the <br />nation and not suggestive of Buddhism overtones.</p>
<p>The historical read / suggestion seem very interesting though.</p>

        <p>Ravi, I just took one meaning of tiger, which is warrior spirit, <br />Durga riding tiger is intended as warrior spirit in some <br />interpretations. I do agree with your interpretation also.</p>
<p>If you belive Ayyappa really rode a tiger that is fine, there are <br />many of us who believe but we cannot talk like our beliefs are facts. <br />It does not necesarily mean the opposite - that they are lies, but <br />not physical historical facts unless we know for sure. When we are <br />talking of religious topics it makes sense to bring this in and not <br />specify the same but while discussing history or literature it gets <br />confusing that is all since history is not totally beleif and <br />literature is related to story.</p>

<p>  However, WRT to this thread, I believe in reality, Ayyapa was an <br />  incarnate who rode a tiger, that is again not something which is <br />not <br />  possible. Sheer muscle power is not needed to over power animals, <br />be <br />  it a dog or an elephant, they can be controlled by the mind and not <br />  by muscle. I am to believe that when He 'talks' to them, they <br />listen.</p>

<p>    I will just explain what I understand. I don't believe myths are <br />  lies <br />    as commonly said. A myth is an allegorical truth, not a <br />historical <br />    one. Historical truths are factual. Myths may or may not have <br />  origins <br />    in history - the meaning of myth is metaphysical and it is never <br />    intended to be a factual truth.</p>
<p>    Ayyappa riding a tiger may or may not be factual. Tiger <br />represents <br />    warrior spirit/consciousness. The Divine God riding it represents <br />  the <br />    surrender of that consciousness to Divine Will. To me that makes <br />  much <br />    better sense than making a macho guy of 14 year old Ayyappa <br />    conquering tiger.</p>

        <p>Malathi, </p>
<p>I dont believe Skanda or Ayyapa to be a myth. I think time plays this <br />trick to converting a legend to myth.</p>
<p>Skanda is said to be prior to the time of Lord Narasimha during the <br />Krita Yuga. While our time in history makes reality turn to legends <br />then as fables and lands up as myth, obviously, data could be lost in <br />transit.</p>
<p>Ayyapa on the other hand, is later gen, vavar, the sea man on the <br />arabian coast, is a friend of Manikandan, who is islamic (very lesser <br />known religion then), which takes us to less than 2000 years ago, I <br />would time it close to the heels of the Pallava dynasty.<br />Killing of Mahishi, is relatively easier, Rama took on Tataka when he <br />was 14. <br />Riding a tiger again is nothing out of the blue, as late as 1658 AD, <br />Kumaragurupara did ride a lion into court yard of the sulatanate of <br />Delhi.</p>
<p>In 2005 census, India had 21K odd elephants, but when you look at <br />elephants, in another 500 years, we will talk as if pulikesi's army <br />was a joke as elephants themselves would not possibly gone for war.</p>
<p>Schliemann believed that Homer's myth of Achilles was a legend when <br />the rest of the world thought otherwise, the archelogist found Troy <br />and Priam's treasures, exactly where Homer had said they were burried.</p>
<p>Time - makes things change, no wonder, the great Azhwar composed:<br />pallANdu pallANdu pallAyiraththANdu<br />pala kOdi nURAyiram<br />mallANda thiN thOL maNivaNNA! un<br />sEvadi sevvi thirukkAppu	</p>
<p>Vyakyana Saram<br />Seeing that Lord with great auspicious qualities, in this world which <br />is subject to time, Azhvar is worried what might happen to Him. <br />Therefore he performs mangalashasanam to Him that His beauty be <br />protected for as long as time is there. </p>

<p>        The children who entered battle were perhaps inspirational to <br />  the <br />        army/generals and other soldiers. The motivated army won the <br />    battle, <br />        not the child, is my thinking. Exaggereted accounts of age <br />are <br />    very <br />        possible. It is humanly impossible for children to do battle <br />  and <br />        weild weapons like adults too and against an army of adults.</p>
<p>      As Ilavarasi pointed out, we have recent (?) history of <br />  Prithviraj <br />      Chauhan and Akbar. Akbar ascended the throne at 16 and is one <br />    of 'The <br />      Great' in India.</p>
<p>      My collegue here, and american told me yesterday, that his <br />  friends <br />      son, who is just 15 is interested in weight lifting and built a <br />      muscular body, a perfect v shape, is 200 pounds (100kg) and <br />  doesnt <br />      look like a 15 year kid....he said 'he is a kind of person whom <br />  you <br />      dont wish to meet in a dark alley'...</p>
<p>      so if its possible today, why not in the historical period...</p>

<p>    -- We have the example of a snake that was bigger than a bus :-)<br />    I have read somewhere that those ages, people were much taller <br />and <br />    stronger than we are now.</p>
<p>    Who knows, when Skanda as a balagan ( 7 year old) old can battle <br />    Sooran or Ayyapan at 12 years can ride on a tiger and kill <br />mahishi, <br />    the age sampling is not accurate for current times to then, but <br />  only <br />    validate the younger age of these children against our generation.</p>

<p>Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>I was also toying with similar line of thinking...</p>
<p>just recalled the KAVASAM (Steel Chain Armour) of Veerapandya <br />Kattabomman - displayed in Pudukottai museum .. </p>
<p>His lengthy Sword and other weaponaries..</p>
<p>Present day normal Soldiers cannot EVEN Lift them.. Leave alone <br />wearing and fighting in a war !!</p>
<p>And it is said that Peria Marudhu is such an expert in "Valai Eri " a <br />Native "Boomerang" which when thrown from a Temple entrance (Madurai / <br />near Madurai) crossed Theppakulam and hit a target .. (mentioning of <br />atleast 400 - 500 feet length crossing and hitting a target in <br />precision).. meaning all the Olympic / Guinness records shattered !!</p>
<p>That is about 200 year old details ..</p>
<p>This gives us some insight of their physique, strength, will, <br />methodologies, techniques etc...</p>
<p>We are talking of 1000 year back Adithakarikalan and atleast 6000 yr <br />back Rama connections.. !</p>

        <p>Dear Deepa, knowledge, meagre or otherwise is nothing to be ashamed <br />about. A healthy mind encourages debate so let us not feel guilty <br />about anything :))</p>
<p>Yes Sita is at times said to be 'older' than Rama because she was not <br />born by ordinary human birth she was eternal and her birth date was <br />just the day she was found at the plough by Janaka. Valmiki mentions <br />she is of 'marriageble age' with some description of her bodily <br />features which suggest a young woman not a child and he also <br />describes in no uncertain times their union and married life for 12 <br />years before they are exiled. Their marraige was therefore definitely <br />not a child marriage.</p>
<p>There are some researches done based on astrology with Rama's <br />horoscope, am unable to find them right away. Let us remember tho <br />cthat the Ramayana is not a history text it is a work of poetry <br />wiisth some historical origins. Valmiki says Dasaratha ruled 10000 <br />years and Rama 11000 which is logically impossible, if we are <br />talkting different years he also says 14 years of exile which is <br />vwhld ery long so one has to attribute poetic exaggerations in some <br />cases.</p>
<p>Generally put I find it odd and must confess somewhat disgusting to <br />even imagine child marriages, child warriors and so on. Not sure <br />about others. 12 yer old <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym courting 8 year old Nandhini is just not <br />appealing in the least. And a kid slashing sword at grown men is just<br />even more gross/unappealing. Am not sure why we must argue to <br />maintain these images.</acronym></p>

<p>  1. Valmiki mentions Rama as 14 when Vishwamitra asks for him. <br />  Dasharatha says that Rama is a mere boy of 14 who falls asleep in <br />the <br />  evening.. how can he fight with Asuras who are always awake only in <br />  the night. (if I remember, while refusing, Dasharatha says Rama is <br />  a "rajiva lochana" (lotus-flowered).

<p>  2. I believe, in Kamba ramayanam, Janaka bemoans how Sita is <br />already <br />  8 and is still unmarried :) (cant vouch for this)</p>
<p>  3. Rama was 16 when his first coronation was being planned (and <br />when <br />  he left for the forest) - from a book I read.<br />  This is a complicated book called Astronimical history of the Vedic <br />  period (based on research funded by Dr.N.Mahalingam) which <br />validates <br />  this based on the detailed astronomical facts mentioned by Valmiki. <br />I <br />  will try to get some excerpts scanned soon. </p>

<p>  Of course, none of these confirm Sita's age.</p>
<p>  However, having read a few historical works, I won't be surprised <br />if <br />  Rama/Sita/historical charactes were not even in their teens when <br />they <br />  showed valor/love. </p>
<p>  On a side note, I marvel at our collective consciousness that we <br />dig <br />  deeper into our epics, try to prove/disprove with such meagre <br />  evidence (and in my case, with meagre/second-hand knowledge!) and <br />  never get tired of it :)<br />  Deepa</p>
<p>      No the Ramayana does not say Sita was 8 when she was married. <br />She <br />    was <br />      2 years younger to Rama. He was 16 when he left with <br />Vishwamitra <br />    that <br />      makes her 14. I will post some references on this later.</p>
<p>      Malathi</p>
<p>    I think Rama left for 'vanavasam' at 16 and not with Vishwamitra <br />at <br />    16. I think he was 12 when Vishwamitra took him. And if he was <br />16, <br />    Dasaratha had no reasons to say 'No' to vishwamitra claiming that <br />  he <br />    is a mere child and cannot protect him and he can come with <br />    vishwamitra to protect his penance.</p>

        <p>Ravi, Skanda and Ayyappan are myths let us not confuse that with <br />history (Atleast Ramyana and Mahabharat have some evidence of history <br />attached) Am not saying rare instances are possible but not the <br />number and kind in history besides having proxy young kings such as <br />Akbar with wise ministers ruling while they reached adulthood is a <br />proven fact.</p>
<p>Children have to have time and age to mature into adults we cannot <br />take that away from any time and age. There are few things as <br />irritating as a over grown child and that is true everywhere.</p>

<p>      The children who entered battle were perhaps inspirational to <br />the <br />      army/generals and other soldiers. The motivated army won the <br />  battle, <br />      not the child, is my thinking. Exaggereted accounts of age are <br />  very <br />      possible. It is humanly impossible for children to do battle <br />and <br />      weild weapons like adults too and against an army of adults.</p>
<p>    As Ilavarasi pointed out, we have recent (?) history of <br />Prithviraj <br />    Chauhan and Akbar. Akbar ascended the throne at 16 and is one <br />  of 'The <br />    Great' in India.</p>
<p>    My collegue here, and american told me yesterday, that his <br />friends <br />    son, who is just 15 is interested in weight lifting and built a <br />    muscular body, a perfect v shape, is 200 pounds (100kg) and <br />doesnt <br />    look like a 15 year kid....he said 'he is a kind of person whom <br />you <br />    dont wish to meet in a dark alley'...</p>
<p>    so if its possible today, why not in the historical period...</p>

<p>Dear Malathy,</p>
<p>Its been a while since I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , but I seem to remember that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  was 25. Kundavai was 22 or 21, and AV was 19-20. I remember making out lists (:P) andtrying to match ages or something. I could be wrong, I guess. </p>

<p>I think Rama left for 'vanavasam' at 16 and not with Vishwamitra at <br />16. I think he was 12 when Vishwamitra took him. And if he was 16, <br />Dasaratha had no reasons to say 'No' to vishwamitra claiming that he <br />is a mere child and cannot protect him and he can come with <br />vishwamitra to protect his penance.</p>

        <p>Deepa, child marraige was very common in those days Tagore and <br />english authors did write a lot about it. If I reemmber right TAgore <br />rarely missed out on the fact that the victims are children.</p>
<p>No the Ramayana does not say Sita was 8 when she was married. She was <br />2 years younger to Rama. He was 16 when he left with Vishwamitra that <br />makes her 14. I will post some references on this later.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Malathy<br />  You may be right in today's case. But when you read Sarat <br />  chandra/Tagore's novels or even pre-Elizabethan England, girls <br />seemed <br />  ready by 12-13. I am guessing it may have been true in the Muslim <br />  courts as well. I also read a couple of Phillippa Gregory's books <br />  about Henry the VIII's reign/wives, and the girls in his court were <br />  trained to attract rich men by the time they were 12-13. Since <br />  reputation/virginity was considered of supreme importance, parents <br />  wanted to marry them off as early as possible to prevent any <br />scandal. </p>
<p>  Sita was supposed to be only 8 when she saw Rama.. I think Rama was <br />  12. And they are supposed to have been "attracted" to each other.. <br />  with all the "nokkinal, nokkinar" business :) (well, this may be <br />true <br />  or may be a legend just like Dasharatha's ruling for 10,000 years :)</p>
<p>  I think while a big part of the "falling in love" process depends <br />on <br />  hormones, a small part may also be due to the expectations placed <br />on <br />  you. For e.g., if right from age 3/4, if one is brainwashed into <br />  thinking of love/husband, maybe one would succumb earlier.. </p>
<p>  I am sure some psychoanalyst somewhere has researched this.. <br />  Deepa</p>

<p>      at 14(?) aditya hacks off the head of vira pandyan.<br />      must have been in love with nandini for quite some time.<br />      she must have been 12 at that time.</p>

        <p>The children who entered battle were perhaps inspirational to the <br />army/generals and other soldiers. The motivated army won the battle, <br />not the child, is my thinking.

        <p>As for me, you aren't wrong. While going to the battle at Ilangai AV was 19. It is also given that Kundhavai is two years elder to him. So 21? Adithya24. But Vandhiyathevan? He should be younger to Adithya? I guess.</p>

<p>Dear Malathy,</p>
<p>Its been a while since I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , but I seem to remember that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  was 25. Kundavai was 22 or 21, and AV was 19-20. I remember making out lists (:P) andtrying to match ages or something. I could be wrong, I guess. </p>

<p>chevvur battle was 959 AD. Adiya assasination is 969AD. The happenings<br />in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  could best span a period o a few months. So you are looking at<br />say 969 AD - <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym would have been 24-26.</p>

<p>    Venkat, some things are generic, depending on physical growth and <br />    development in any time and age. 12 year olds cannot fall in <br />love, <br />    the hormones and chemicals for that do not evolve until much <br />    later.When our grandmothers times people used to wed early (my <br />    grandmother wed at 8) the children stay with their parents until <br />  the <br />    right age (usually 16). </p>
<p>    Teenagers are people between adulthood and childhood. They are <br />    usually driven by urges and less by thinking. Am not sure if <br />these <br />    things are not true in PS times - they are true of all mankind.</p>
<p>    Killing..well if the child is trained perhaps, he could kill. <br />Given <br />    those times it was considred self defence and defence of the <br />  country <br />    so perhaps acceptable, although no 14 year old can weild a heavy <br />    sword like a grown man. His muscles would not have developed <br />enough.</p>
<p>    Am sure some liberties were taken with regards to description of <br />  age <br />    in historical records. The Ramayana for examples states that <br />    Dasaratha ruled 10,000 years. Perhaps a praiseworthy description <br />  not <br />    reality.</p>

<p>          its not every day or every guy who gets to meet up with <br />girls <br />      like <br />          kunthavai and nandini on subsequent days.</p>
<p>          but by those days standards nandini was married already <br />and <br />        married <br />          to a guy who has the worst temper in chola land.<br />          Vd was indeed more than carried away by nature.</p>

        <p>No it is not mentioned anywhere.<br />Also, 1 point that i noted was... it is asumed that Nandhini was younger to<br />Aditya.<br />and Nandhini and Madhuranthakan were twins.<br />Hence, Madhuranthakan was younger to Aditya.<br />But in the intro scene of Aditya in mamallapuram, aditya refers to<br />madhuranthakan as an 'old man' mockingly when dicussing abt his recent<br />marriage.</p>
<p>Isnt there a slip somewhere?</p>

<blockquote><p>  Venkat, some things are generic, depending on physical growth and <br />  development in any time and age. 12 year olds cannot fall in love, <br />  the hormones and chemicals for that do not evolve until much <br />  later.When our grandmothers times people used to wed early (my <br />  grandmother wed at 8) the children stay with their parents until <br />the <br />  right age (usually 16). </p>
<p>  Teenagers are people between adulthood and childhood. They are <br />  usually driven by urges and less by thinking. Am not sure if these <br />  things are not true in PS times - they are true of all mankind.</p>
<p>  Killing..well if the child is trained perhaps, he could kill. Given <br />  those times it was considred self defence and defence of the <br />country <br />  so perhaps acceptable, although no 14 year old can weild a heavy <br />  sword like a grown man. His muscles would not have developed enough.</p>
<p>  Am sure some liberties were taken with regards to description of <br />age <br />  in historical records. The Ramayana for examples states that <br />  Dasaratha ruled 10,000 years. Perhaps a praiseworthy description <br />not <br />  reality.</p>
<p>  Would very much like to know more,</p>

        <p>Dear Malathy,<br />Its been a while since I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , but I seem to remember that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  was 25.<br />Kundavai was 22 or 21, and AV was 19-20. I remember making out lists (:P)<br />and trying to match ages or something. I could be wrong, I guess.</acronym></p>

        <p>Malathy<br />You may be right in today's case. But when you read Sarat <br />chandra/Tagore's novels or even pre-Elizabethan England, girls seemed <br />ready by 12-13. I am guessing it may have been true in the Muslim <br />courts as well. I also read a couple of Phillippa Gregory's books <br />about Henry the VIII's reign/wives, and the girls in his court were <br />trained to attract rich men by the time they were 12-13. Since <br />reputation/virginity was considered of supreme importance, parents <br />wanted to marry them off as early as possible to prevent any scandal. </p>
<p>Sita was supposed to be only 8 when she saw Rama.. I think Rama was <br />12. And they are supposed to have been "attracted" to each other.. <br />with all the "nokkinal, nokkinar" business :) (well, this may be true <br />or may be a legend just like Dasharatha's ruling for 10,000 years :)</p>
<p>I think while a big part of the "falling in love" process depends on <br />hormones, a small part may also be due to the expectations placed on <br />you. For e.g., if right from age 3/4, if one is brainwashed into <br />thinking of love/husband, maybe one would succumb earlier.. </p>
<p>I am sure some psychoanalyst somewhere has researched this.. <br />Deepa</p>

<blockquote><p>  Venkat, some things are generic, depending on physical growth and <br />  development in any time and age. 12 year olds cannot fall in love, <br />  the hormones and chemicals for that do not evolve until much <br />  later.When our grandmothers times people used to wed early (my <br />  grandmother wed at 8) the children stay with their parents until <br />the <br />  right age (usually 16). </p>
<p>  Teenagers are people between adulthood and childhood. They are <br />  usually driven by urges and less by thinking. Am not sure if these <br />  things are not true in PS times - they are true of all mankind.</p>
<p>  Killing..well if the child is trained perhaps, he could kill. Given <br />  those times it was considred self defence and defence of the <br />country <br />  so perhaps acceptable, although no 14 year old can weild a heavy <br />  sword like a grown man. His muscles would not have developed enough.</p>
<p>  Am sure some liberties were taken with regards to description of <br />age <br />  in historical records. The Ramayana for examples states that <br />  Dasaratha ruled 10,000 years. Perhaps a praiseworthy description <br />not <br />  reality.</p>
