<p>- Bhishma<br />- Drona<br />- Karna<br />- Shalya<br />- Kripacharya<br />- Ashwatthama<br />- Duryodhan</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>*Pandavas :*</p>
<p>Exiled for 13 years. Have no kingdom. Their main strength both in terms of<br />political and financial power depends on their friends and relatives : The<br />Pancalas, The Yadavas, The Magadhas and The Chedis.</p>
<p>*Kauravas : *</p>
<p>In power for 13 years. Duryodhan has been a benevolent king. Theres no<br />guarantee that the Subjects really miss the Pandavas. Not only have they the<br />wealth and power of Hastinapur, but also that of Indraprastha, the kingdom<br />that the Pandvas had taken such labors to build and which had surpassed the<br />Hastina of old in all degrees. Karna had gone on a nation-wide conquering on<br />behalf of Duryodhana. They are the national sovereigns</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<p>*Kauravas :*</p>
<p>*"Without war, will concede not a needle-prick of earth." - Duryodhna*</p>
<p>Duryodhana was completely focused on the War.It was his moment of truth. He<br />had usurped a kingdom, and he meant to keep it. He had resorted to any<br />means, foul or fair to get the kingdom, which he believed to be rightfully<br />his, and he was in no mood to give it up.</p>
<p>*Pandavas : *</p>
<p>*"We fight over a Kingdom, as dogs over a piece of meat."-Yudhisthira*</p>
<p>The Pandavas had been humiliated, their wife insulted, their kingdom taken.<br />But?still they wanted to avoid the War. The three elder Pandavas were<br />against the War. They even went as far as making an offer that they will<br />stop the War in exchange of 5 villages.</p>
<p>Result</p>
<p>*War Lasted : *18 Days. 10 Days (Bhisma), 3 Days(Drona), 1? Days (Karna) ?<br />Day (No General),1 Day (Shalya), 1 Night(Ashwatthama)</p>
<p>*18th Night of the War :*</p>
<p>Ashwatthama slaughtered the Pandava camp in sleep.</p>
<p>*Before That :*</p>
<p>*Kauravas :*</p>
<p>Bhishma, Drona, Karna and his sons, Shalya, Bhagadutta, Bhurisrava,<br />Susharma, Jayadrath, Duhsasana and all of Duryodhana's brothers, Shakuni and<br />Ulooka.</p>
<p>*Pandavas :*</p>
<p>Drupad, Virat and his sons, Abhimanyu, Ghatotkach and Iravan.</p>
<p>SO</p>
<p>HOW</p>
<p>DID</p>
<p>THE</p>
<p>PANDAVAS</p>
<p>WIN</p>
<p>?????</p>
<p>Preparation</p>
<p>*Kauravas* :</p>
<p>- *Karna* went on a country-wide military mission, subdued the different<br />kingdoms and acquired wealth. But it meant a loss in terms of both men and<br />money and creation of new enemies.</p>
<p>*Pandavas* : Though in exile they turned their attention to improving over<br />their weakness</p>
<p>- *Arjuna* set out on a mission to acquires Divyastras.<br />- *Bhima* met his brother Hanuman and got a blessing of enhanced<br />strength.<br />- *Yudhisthira* acquired teachings from the various wise rishis, and also<br />learnt the Game of Dice from Gandharava Chtrasena, lest he was challenged to<br />yet another dice game. Its said that he had become undefeatable in Dice.</p>
<p>*Turn your weakness into your Strength.*</p>
<p>Allies</p>
<p>*Kauravas* : Centralized power system. The greatest empire of the time. But<br />not many powerful allies, except from old relations from far off places like<br />Gandhara(Shakuni), Sindhu(Jayadrath) and Kambodia(Camboja - Bhagadutt)</p>
<p>*Pandavas* : No wealth. No power of their own. But powerful allies all over<br />India.</p>
<p>- Panchala through Marriage with Darupadi.<br />- Dwarka through marriage with Arjuna and Subhadra.<br />- Magadh through marriage of Shadeva and Vijaya.<br />- Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi.<br />- Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara.<br />- Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika.<br />- Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara.<br />- The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba.<br />- The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi.</p>
<p>*Make Powerful Allies.*</p>
<p>Leadership</p>
<p>*Kauravas* : Centralized leadership. One Head of Army at a time, who has<br />supreme authority of 11 akshouhini of army. Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Shalya<br />and Ashwatthama.</p>
<p>*Pandavas* : Distributed leadership. Seven commanders for the seven<br />divisions.(1 man command 1 akshouhini each).</p>
<p>- Virat (King of Matsya).<br />- Drupad (King of Pancala).<br />- Sahadeva(King of Magadha).<br />- Dhrshtaketu (King of Chedi).<br />- Satyaki (Only warrior from Dwarka).<br />- Shikhandi (Prince of Pancala).</p>
<p>Dhrshtadymna ? Commander in Chief.</p>
<p>Arjuna ?Supreme Commander.</p>
<p>Krishna ? Arjuna's charioteer and counselor.</p>
<p>*Share your responsibilities.*</p>
<p>Team Spirit</p>
<p>*Kauravas* : No team spirit. They all fought their individual wars.</p>
<p>- Bhishma : For his Vow to protect the throne Hastinapur.<br />- Drona and Kripa : They owed allegiance to the throne.<br />- Shalya : Simply cheated by Duryodhana to be there. Was originally a<br />Pandava ally.<br />- Karna : To prove his mantle against Arjuna. Friendship for Duryodhana.</p>
<p>They didn't gel well with each other. Bhishma and Karna. Bhisma and Shakuni.<br />Karna nd Shakuni. Karna and Shalya. Shalya and Bhishma. It was like a bees,<br />hornets and mosquitoes put together in a jar.</p>
<p>*Pandavas* : One team. One Goal. As men, they all had huge respect for<br />Krishna and Yudhisthira. While as warriors they were in complete awe of<br />Bhima and Arjuna. Most of them were close relatives ? cousins,<br />brother-in-laws, father-in-laws. More than that they all were part of the<br />decision-making process. It was their "common" war.</p>
<p>*Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails.*</p>
<p>Individual Motives</p>
<p>*Kauravas* : Except for Duryodhana nobody wanted the War. All the 4 main<br />generals had strong ties with the Pandavas.</p>
<p>- Bhishma(grandchildern) ? Wont kill the panadavas. Will kill a thousand<br />soldiers each day.<br />- Drona (students) ? Wont kill the Pandavas. Will capture them only.<br />- Shalya (Nakula-Shadeva's maternal uncle) : Loved the Pandavas and<br />covertly helped them by humiliating Karna<br />- Karna (brother to the Pandavas) : Promised not to kill any of the other<br />Pandavas save Arjuna.</p>
<p>A Team of Traitors.</p>
<p>*Pandavas* : Common goal. But the individuals had their individual targets.<br />Their own agenda, which just became one with the teams' agenda.</p>
<p>- Dhratsadyumna : Drona.<br />- Shikhandi : Bhisma.<br />- Satayaki ? Bhurisravas.<br />- Arjuna ? Karna.<br />- Bhima ? Duryodhana and his brothers.<br />- Sahadeva ? Shakuni and his sons.<br />- Nakula ?Karna's sons.</p>
<p>*The Right team is made by selecting the Right Individuals. Get the right<br />man for the right job.*</p>
<p>Commitment</p>
<p>*Kauravas* : Already said the Big 4 had big emotional attachment with the 5<br />Pandavas. Looking further on their commitment.</p>
<p>- Bhisma himself gave away the secret of killing him to the Pandavas.He<br />prolonged the War by killing only inconsequential soldiers. He did not fight<br />a warrior like Shikhandi because of his personal bias.<br />- Drona too indirectly gave away his secret, by saying he was<br />invulnerable as long as he held a weapon. Moreover he abandoned weapons as<br />soon as he knew his son had died.<br />- Karna did not kill Yudhisthira and BHima when he got the chance. He<br />gave away his Kavac and Kundala prior to his War. Karna fled innumerous<br />times from the War when he was hurt. He didn't save Duhsasana when Bhimawas<br />killing him.<br />- Shalya kept on insulting Karna while in Battle.</p>
<p>*Pandavas* :</p>
<p>- Abhimanyu , a 16 year old kid. Ventured beyond enemy lines alone. This<br />was suicide mission but he still went in and took a great part of the army<br />down with him. It took the combined effort of 7 Maharathis to take him down.<br />- Ghatotkach even in death, took with him almost half the army.<br />- Yudhisthira, he knew he couldn't face Karna in War, but still went in<br />to set an example. Yudhitshira didn't hesitate to tell a lie or a twisted<br />truth when faced with the decision of whether to stick to his personal<br />integrity or welfare of the team.<br />- Krishna took up arms twice and almost entered the War, inspite of his<br />promise, only to be stopped by Arjuna.</p>
<p>*The interests of the Individual should never exceed the Team interest.*</p>
<p>*The best man for a Job is not the one with the best capabilities but one<br />with the greatest commitment.*</p>
<p>Right Managers</p>
<p>*Krishna** :* The Greatest Crisis Manager the world has seen.</p>
<p>*Yudhisthira *: Low-key strategist.</p>
<p>- On the first day of the War, he played a Master game. Went over to the<br />Enemy side to seek blessings from Elders. In reality he made a covert deal<br />with them, wherein all of them agreed to help him and unfolded the secrets<br />of defeating them.<br />- While coming back, he took a calculated risk. He made an offer to all<br />the assembled people to change sides if they wanted to. He knew well of the<br />lack of cohesiveness among the Kauravas. Yuyutsu, son of Dhrtarashtra<br />crossed over to the Pandavas. This exposed the weakness of the Kauravas<br />for all to see.</p>
<p>Know your enemies weaknesses and exploit them.</p>
<p>Take Calculated risks.</p>
<p>Inspire, invigorate, counsel your own team in moments of need.</p>
<p>The Roots</p>
<p>*Kauravas :* Princes brought up in the comfort of the Royal Palace, matured<br />on romanticized ideals of Power, Fame, Courage and Valor. No experience of<br />ground reality.</p>
<p>*Pandavas *:</p>
<p>- Spent the greater part of their lives in Poverty. Childhood in the<br />Himalayan foothills among Rishis. One year exile among the poor people of<br />Kuru-Panchala. 12 years of Vanvas and 1 year of Agyatvas.<br />- Experinced with the ground reality. Contact with people from various<br />strata of the society. Sannyasis (celibate monks), Acharyas(Householders,<br />teachers), poor Brahmanas, lower-class Potter.<br />- Different races of people. Rakshasas, Gandharavas, Apsaras, Nagas.<br />People from different regions Uttarkuru, Bengal etc.<br />- A Sense of Sharing. A sense of Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Know ground realities.</p>
<p>Know different ideologies.</p>
<p>Share.</p>
<p>Women Empowerment</p>
<p>*Kauravas :* Patriarchal structure. Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Dhratarashtra,<br />Vidur, Shakuni, Duryodhana, Karna, Duhsasana. No women in the decision<br />making process.</p>
<p>Gandhari retreated to the Inner Chambers. Nobody listened to her.</p>
<p>*Pandavas *: Matriarchal Structure.</p>
<p>- Kunti was the authority supreme for the Pandavas.</p>
<p>"Whatever my mother says is Dharma to me" : Yudhisthira.</p>
<p>- Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big<br />role in all the decision making. Without her the Pandavas would have most<br />probably reclined to the forests.<br />- Even the younger Pandavas : Ghatotkach, Abhimnanyu and Iravan were<br />brought up by their mothers. So the female influence was huge.</p>
<p>Women = Better Half. Any team which doesn't have women is unbalanced, for<br />the Masculine traits of Aggression and Dominance should be balanced by the<br />Feminine traits of Harmony and Sustenance.</p>
<p>Recap</p>
<p>- Turn your weaknesses into strengths.<br />- Turn enemies into allies.<br />- Share your responsibilities.<br />- Teamwork scores over Individual Effort.<br />- Right Team = Right set of Individuals. The right man for the right job.<br />- Commitment scores over Competence.<br />- Team interests over Individual interests..<br />- Know your enemy/challenges. Exploit its weaknesses. Take calculated<br />risks.<br />- The Right Managers : To inspire, invigorate, counsel in crisis .<br />- Know Ground realities. Accept different ideologies. Cooperate.<br />- Empower Women. The Gender Balance is required for stability and<br />administration.</p>

        <p>I am not sure whether this is relevant, but thought will post as it is <br />related to Mahabratham and we are discussing a few aspects of that too.</p>
<p>Came across this link, an article from Times of India...</p>

<p>Says..Krishna lived for 125 years and gives proof for that. </p>
<p>We have discussed a lot about Mahabaratha, and a lot of questions were <br />unanswered to many of us. </p>
<p>Came across these links from <a href="http://www.tamilhindu.com" title="www.tamilhindu.com">www.tamilhindu.com</a>..</p>
<p>Mr.Harikrishnan has taken the original source 'Vyasa Bharatham' to <br />explain many of the questions we came across in our threads years ago. <br />MAY BE USEFUL TO MEMBERS. IF NOT PLEASE IGNORE THIS POST.</p>

<p>Reminds me ::</p>
<p>In Darasuram Airavatheswarar temple there is a rare sculpture .. mix <br />of some animal / bird.. and the very elderly Guide ( think Balu .. <br />now passed away) explained me ten years back that it figured in <br />HOMERs ODYSSI. !</p>
<p>Dear Vijay, I will try to locate some photo for you.</p>

<p>      Thanks Swaroopini. Very good indeed.<br />      By the way, if Mahabratha is the second longest Epic, which is <br />the<br />      first one?<br />      If I am correct, the starting trivia is...<br />      'If there is anything in the world, it is there in <br />Mahabaratha.

        <p>Interesting macro. Enjoyed the compilation.</p>
<p>The prime difference, from my view, was Krishna and his governance. <br />Kauravas were far more superior in power and balance, in human terms.<br />Ofcourse, Krishna alone, made the difference.</p>

<p>  - Bhishma<br />  - Drona<br />  - Karna<br />  - Shalya<br />  - Kripacharya<br />  - Ashwatthama<br />  - Duryodhan</p>
<p>  Background</p>
<p>  *Pandavas :*</p>
<p>  Exiled for 13 years. Have no kingdom. Their main strength both in <br />terms of<br />  political and financial power depends on their friends and <br />relatives : The<br />  Pancalas, The Yadavas, The Magadhas and The Chedis.</p>
<p>  *Kauravas : *</p>
<p>  In power for 13 years. Duryodhan has been a benevolent king. Theres <br />no<br />  guarantee that the Subjects really miss the Pandavas. Not only have <br />they the<br />  wealth and power of Hastinapur, but also that of Indraprastha, the <br />kingdom<br />  that the Pandvas had taken such labors to build and which had <br />surpassed the<br />  Hastina of old in all degrees. Karna had gone on a nation-wide <br />conquering on<br />  behalf of Duryodhana. They are the national sovereigns</p>
<p>  Motivation</p>
<p>  *Kauravas :*</p>
<p>  *"Without war, will concede not a needle-prick of earth." - <br />Duryodhna*</p>
<p>  Duryodhana was completely focused on the War.It was his moment of <br />truth. He<br />  had usurped a kingdom, and he meant to keep it. He had resorted to <br />any<br />  means, foul or fair to get the kingdom, which he believed to be <br />rightfully<br />  his, and he was in no mood to give it up.</p>
<p>  *Pandavas : *</p>
<p>  *"We fight over a Kingdom, as dogs over a piece of meat."-<br />Yudhisthira*</p>
<p>  The Pandavas had been humiliated, their wife insulted, their <br />kingdom taken.<br />  But?still they wanted to avoid the War. The three elder Pandavas <br />were<br />  against the War. They even went as far as making an offer that they <br />will<br />  stop the War in exchange of 5 villages.</p>
<p>  Result</p>
<p>  *War Lasted : *18 Days. 10 Days (Bhisma), 3 Days(Drona), 1? Days <br />(Karna) ?<br />  Day (No General),1 Day (Shalya), 1 Night(Ashwatthama)</p>
<p>  *18th Night of the War :*</p>
<p>  Ashwatthama slaughtered the Pandava camp in sleep.</p>
<p>  *Before That :*</p>
<p>  *Kauravas :*</p>
<p>  Bhishma, Drona, Karna and his sons, Shalya, Bhagadutta, Bhurisrava,<br />  Susharma, Jayadrath, Duhsasana and all of Duryodhana's brothers, <br />Shakuni and<br />  Ulooka.</p>
<p>  *Pandavas :*</p>
<p>  Drupad, Virat and his sons, Abhimanyu, Ghatotkach and Iravan.</p>
<p>  SO</p>
<p>  HOW</p>
<p>  DID</p>
<p>  THE</p>
<p>  PANDAVAS</p>
<p>  WIN</p>
<p>  ?????</p>
<p>  Preparation</p>
<p>  *Kauravas* :</p>
<p>  - *Karna* went on a country-wide military mission, subdued the <br />different<br />  kingdoms and acquired wealth. But it meant a loss in terms of <br />both men and<br />  money and creation of new enemies.</p>
<p>  *Pandavas* : Though in exile they turned their attention to <br />improving over<br />  their weakness</p>
<p>  - *Arjuna* set out on a mission to acquires Divyastras.<br />  - *Bhima* met his brother Hanuman and got a blessing of enhanced<br />  strength.<br />  - *Yudhisthira* acquired teachings from the various wise rishis, <br />and also<br />  learnt the Game of Dice from Gandharava Chtrasena, lest he was <br />challenged to<br />  yet another dice game. Its said that he had become undefeatable <br />in Dice.</p>
<p>  *Turn your weakness into your Strength.*</p>
<p>  Allies</p>
<p>  *Kauravas* : Centralized power system. The greatest empire of the <br />time. But<br />  not many powerful allies, except from old relations from far off <br />places like<br />  Gandhara(Shakuni), Sindhu(Jayadrath) and Kambodia(Camboja - <br />Bhagadutt)</p>
<p>  *Pandavas* : No wealth. No power of their own. But powerful allies <br />all over<br />  India.</p>
<p>  - Panchala through Marriage with Darupadi.<br />  - Dwarka through marriage with Arjuna and Subhadra.<br />  - Magadh through marriage of Shadeva and Vijaya.<br />  - Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi.<br />  - Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara.<br />  - Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika.<br />  - Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara.<br />  - The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba.<br />  - The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi.</p>
<p>  *Make Powerful Allies.*</p>
<p>  Leadership</p>
<p>  *Kauravas* : Centralized leadership. One Head of Army at a time, <br />who has<br />  supreme authority of 11 akshouhini of army. Bhishma, Drona, Karna, <br />Shalya<br />  and Ashwatthama.</p>
<p>  *Pandavas* : Distributed leadership. Seven commanders for the seven<br />  divisions.(1 man command 1 akshouhini each).</p>
<p>  - Virat (King of Matsya).<br />  - Drupad (King of Pancala).<br />  - Sahadeva(King of Magadha).<br />  - Dhrshtaketu (King of Chedi).<br />  - Satyaki (Only warrior from Dwarka).<br />  - Shikhandi (Prince of Pancala).</p>
<p>  Dhrshtadymna ? Commander in Chief.</p>
<p>  Arjuna ?Supreme Commander.</p>
<p>  Krishna ? Arjuna's charioteer and counselor.</p>
<p>  *Share your responsibilities.*</p>
<p>  Team Spirit</p>
<p>  *Kauravas* : No team spirit. They all fought their individual wars.</p>
<p>  - Bhishma : For his Vow to protect the throne Hastinapur.<br />  - Drona and Kripa : They owed allegiance to the throne.<br />  - Shalya : Simply cheated by Duryodhana to be there. Was <br />originally a<br />  Pandava ally.<br />  - Karna : To prove his mantle against Arjuna. Friendship for <br />Duryodhana.</p>
<p>  They didn't gel well with each other. Bhishma and Karna. Bhisma and <br />Shakuni.<br />  Karna nd Shakuni. Karna and Shalya. Shalya and Bhishma. It was like <br />a bees,<br />  hornets and mosquitoes put together in a jar.</p>
<p>  *Pandavas* : One team. One Goal. As men, they all had huge respect <br />for<br />  Krishna and Yudhisthira. While as warriors they were in complete <br />awe of<br />  Bhima and Arjuna. Most of them were close relatives ? cousins,<br />  brother-in-laws, father-in-laws. More than that they all were part <br />of the<br />  decision-making process. It was their "common" war.</p>
<p>  *Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails.*</p>
<p>  Individual Motives</p>
<p>  *Kauravas* : Except for Duryodhana nobody wanted the War. All the 4 <br />main<br />  generals had strong ties with the Pandavas.</p>
<p>  - Bhishma(grandchildern) ? Wont kill the panadavas. Will kill a <br />thousand<br />  soldiers each day.<br />  - Drona (students) ? Wont kill the Pandavas. Will capture them <br />only.<br />  - Shalya (Nakula-Shadeva's maternal uncle) : Loved the Pandavas <br />and<br />  covertly helped them by humiliating Karna<br />  - Karna (brother to the Pandavas) : Promised not to kill any of <br />the other<br />  Pandavas save Arjuna.</p>
<p>  A Team of Traitors.</p>
<p>  *Pandavas* : Common goal. But the individuals had their individual <br />targets.<br />  Their own agenda, which just became one with the teams' agenda.</p>
<p>  - Dhratsadyumna : Drona.<br />  - Shikhandi : Bhisma.<br />  - Satayaki ? Bhurisravas.<br />  - Arjuna ? Karna.<br />  - Bhima ? Duryodhana and his brothers.<br />  - Sahadeva ? Shakuni and his sons.<br />  - Nakula ?Karna's sons.</p>
<p>  *The Right team is made by selecting the Right Individuals. Get the <br />right<br />  man for the right job.*</p>
<p>  Commitment</p>
<p>  *Kauravas* : Already said the Big 4 had big emotional attachment <br />with the 5<br />  Pandavas. Looking further on their commitment.</p>
<p>  - Bhisma himself gave away the secret of killing him to the <br />Pandavas.He<br />  prolonged the War by killing only inconsequential soldiers. He <br />did not fight<br />  a warrior like Shikhandi because of his personal bias.<br />  - Drona too indirectly gave away his secret, by saying he was<br />  invulnerable as long as he held a weapon. Moreover he abandoned <br />weapons as<br />  soon as he knew his son had died.<br />  - Karna did not kill Yudhisthira and BHima when he got the <br />chance. He<br />  gave away his Kavac and Kundala prior to his War. Karna fled <br />innumerous<br />  times from the War when he was hurt. He didn't save Duhsasana <br />when Bhima was<br />  killing him.<br />  - Shalya kept on insulting Karna while in Battle.</p>
<p>  *Pandavas* :</p>
<p>  - Abhimanyu , a 16 year old kid. Ventured beyond enemy lines <br />alone. This<br />  was suicide mission but he still went in and took a great part <br />of the army<br />  down with him. It took the combined effort of 7 Maharathis to <br />take him down.<br />  - Ghatotkach even in death, took with him almost half the army.<br />  - Yudhisthira, he knew he couldn't face Karna in War, but still <br />went in<br />  to set an example. Yudhitshira didn't hesitate to tell a lie or <br />a twisted<br />  truth when faced with the decision of whether to stick to his <br />personal<br />  integrity or welfare of the team.<br />  - Krishna took up arms twice and almost entered the War, inspite <br />of his<br />  promise, only to be stopped by Arjuna.</p>
<p>  *The interests of the Individual should never exceed the Team <br />interest.*</p>
<p>  *The best man for a Job is not the one with the best capabilities <br />but one<br />  with the greatest commitment.*</p>
<p>  Right Managers</p>
<p>  *Krishna** :* The Greatest Crisis Manager the world has seen.</p>
<p>  *Yudhisthira *: Low-key strategist.</p>
<p>  - On the first day of the War, he played a Master game. Went <br />over to the<br />  Enemy side to seek blessings from Elders. In reality he made a <br />covert deal<br />  with them, wherein all of them agreed to help him and unfolded <br />the secrets<br />  of defeating them.<br />  - While coming back, he took a calculated risk. He made an offer <br />to all<br />  the assembled people to change sides if they wanted to. He knew <br />well of the<br />  lack of cohesiveness among the Kauravas. Yuyutsu, son of <br />Dhrtarashtra<br />  crossed over to the Pandavas. This exposed the weakness of the <br />Kauravas<br />  for all to see.</p>
<p>  Know your enemies weaknesses and exploit them.</p>
<p>  Take Calculated risks.</p>
<p>  Inspire, invigorate, counsel your own team in moments of need.</p>
<p>  The Roots</p>
<p>  *Kauravas :* Princes brought up in the comfort of the Royal Palace, <br />matured<br />  on romanticized ideals of Power, Fame, Courage and Valor. No <br />experience of<br />  ground reality.</p>
<p>  *Pandavas *:</p>
<p>  - Spent the greater part of their lives in Poverty. Childhood in <br />the<br />  Himalayan foothills among Rishis. One year exile among the poor <br />people of<br />  Kuru-Panchala. 12 years of Vanvas and 1 year of Agyatvas.<br />  - Experinced with the ground reality. Contact with people from <br />various<br />  strata of the society. Sannyasis (celibate monks), Acharyas<br />(Householders,<br />  teachers), poor Brahmanas, lower-class Potter.<br />  - Different races of people. Rakshasas, Gandharavas, Apsaras, <br />Nagas.<br />  People from different regions Uttarkuru, Bengal etc.<br />  - A Sense of Sharing. A sense of Brotherhood.</p>
<p>  Know ground realities.</p>
<p>  Know different ideologies.</p>
<p>  Share.</p>
<p>  Women Empowerment</p>
<p>  *Kauravas :* Patriarchal structure. Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, <br />Dhratarashtra,<br />  Vidur, Shakuni, Duryodhana, Karna, Duhsasana. No women in the <br />decision<br />  making process.</p>
<p>  Gandhari retreated to the Inner Chambers. Nobody listened to <br />her.</p>
<p>  *Pandavas *: Matriarchal Structure.</p>
<p>  - Kunti was the authority supreme for the Pandavas.</p>
<p>  "Whatever my mother says is Dharma to me" : Yudhisthira.</p>
<p>  - Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had <br />a big<br />  role in all the decision making. Without her the Pandavas would <br />have most<br />  probably reclined to the forests.<br />  - Even the younger Pandavas : Ghatotkach, Abhimnanyu and Iravan <br />were<br />  brought up by their mothers. So the female influence was huge.</p>
<p>  Women = Better Half. Any team which doesn't have women is <br />unbalanced, for<br />  the Masculine traits of Aggression and Dominance should be balanced <br />by the<br />  Feminine traits of Harmony and Sustenance.</p>
<p>  Recap</p>
<p>  - Turn your weaknesses into strengths.<br />  - Turn enemies into allies.<br />  - Share your responsibilities.<br />  - Teamwork scores over Individual Effort.<br />  - Right Team = Right set of Individuals. The right man for the <br />right job.<br />  - Commitment scores over Competence.<br />  - Team interests over Individual interests..<br />  - Know your enemy/challenges. Exploit its weaknesses. Take <br />calculated<br />  risks.<br />  - The Right Managers : To inspire, invigorate, counsel in <br />crisis .<br />  - Know Ground realities. Accept different ideologies. Cooperate.<br />  - Empower Women. The Gender Balance is required for stability and<br />  administration.</p>
