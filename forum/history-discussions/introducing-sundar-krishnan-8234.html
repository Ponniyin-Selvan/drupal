<p>venketesh</p>
<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Thanks for your mail. PFA the list of my historical novel collections in pdf form. So for I have spent Rs. 45000 to collect / purchase these novels.60% of the novels purchased directly from publications / author. These project started in the year of 2006. So for 387 novels collected. Still pending is 40 novels which is having a problem that most of the novels are very old and not able to find the author address.</p>
<p>I have to thank Easwary Lending library and 40% of the novels purchased from them due to out of stock in the publications. Also Nivethitha Mr. Swaminathan (SRS). He helped me a lot. In the mean time, I have to say my special thanks to Mr. Vikraman who is guided me in various time. When I start reading Kalki's novel in my college days I was admired by his flow. Also Inoted that the historical novel shows how our ancient people live and their total living activities though it is some time over sided by some authors. At my early days I am unable to spend money to purchase and read the books. Not even novels but also my college books. I spend most of my timingsin the college library and Sarasvathi Mahal library.</p>
<p>Once I joined in the IT, I have decided to make it as a habit and met Mr. Vikraman, Mr. Kovi Manisekaran, Mr. Gowthama Neelambaran, Mr. Thivakar, Mr. Mukilan, Mr. Aikann and Mr. Viswaknesan. When I discussed with them, I understand that how much time they are taking to write a novel and also how much painful it is. To complete / write one historical novel, they have donea lot of research regarding the story main theme.   </p>
<p>I have asked them most of the novels are not re-published or after the author period, no one interested to re-publish the same. In that case why it is not computerized. Mr. Thivakar replied that some of the new writers theyare preserving the DTP work in CD format. But old novels?? No answer for this. </p>
<p>If you take Mr. Lakshmi narayanan.Y. and Mr. Somu most of the novels are not available.</p>
<p>This is the story of my interest in the historical novel collection. Last but not least Novles are the good friend rather than a man hood. It is notexpecting any thing from me. Only thing I have to preserve them and spendfew rupees. When ever I required, it will talk to me.</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards</p>
<p>Sundar Krishnan </p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>  this will vbe a very great Service to future generation.</p>
<p>  Like Kalki created genuine interest among some of the readers (atleast) in<br />  the History of cholas and moovendars in turn, Krishnadevaraya will also<br />  generate such interest .. likewise Nayaks and Sarfoji's History as well ...</p>
<p>  when speaking to Dr. nagaswamy recently he casually told me that near<br />  Mutharasanallur (Mootha Raja Nallur ?? ) Trichy, ALLUR DEVATHANAM - the Siva<br />  Temple was Constructed by the PENDIR OF KODUMBALUR IRUKKUVELIR !!</p>
<p>  Means w/o Sundara Chola - Vanavanmadevi related Queens constructed a Siva<br />  temple on the banks of Cauvery between Trichy and Kulithalai at a place<br />  called Allur. (Kumbabhishegam planned again on 27th Nov this year - with<br />  the support of locals).</p>
<p>  Allur is adjoining Mahadanapuram - which was ONE AMONG CHODASA (16) grants<br />  (Dhanams) by KRISHNA DEVARAYA !!</p>
<p>  Very rightly arun venkataraman pointed out... without Krishnadevaraya -<br />  cant imagine revival of our culture - language and heritage in Southern<br />  parts of India - particularly TN after invasions.</p>
<p>  VERY APT TO RECALL HIS 500 YEAR GLORY..</p>
<p>  And this is a SMALL SPARK created by dear friend Sunder Krishnan.</p>
<p>  We will do our best to support him.</p>
<p>  most welcome dear Sundar Krishnan. pls feel at home..</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>this will vbe a very great Service to future generation.</p>
<p>Like Kalki created genuine interest among some of the readers (atleast) in the History of cholas and moovendars in turn, Krishnadevaraya will also generate such interest .. likewise Nayaks and Sarfoji's History as well ...</p>
<p>when speaking to Dr. nagaswamy recently he casually told me that near Mutharasanallur (Mootha Raja Nallur ?? ) Trichy, ALLUR DEVATHANAM - the Siva Temple was Constructed by the PENDIR OF KODUMBALUR IRUKKUVELIR !!</p>
<p>Means w/o Sundara Chola - Vanavanmadevi related Queens constructed a Siva temple on the banks of Cauvery between Trichy and Kulithalai at a place called Allur. (Kumbabhishegam planned again on 27th Nov this year - with the support of locals). </p>
<p>Allur is adjoining Mahadanapuram - which was ONE AMONG CHODASA (16) grants (Dhanams) by KRISHNA DEVARAYA !!</p>
<p>Very rightly arun venkataraman pointed out... without Krishnadevaraya - cant imagine revival of our culture - language and heritage in Southern parts of India - particularly TN after invasions.</p>
<p>VERY APT TO RECALL HIS 500 YEAR GLORY..</p>
<p>And this is a SMALL SPARK created by dear friend Sunder Krishnan.</p>
<p>We will do our best to support him.</p>
<p>most welcome dear Sundar Krishnan. pls feel at home..</p>
<p>best regards to Venkat and Sundar Krishnan,</p>

It was the first edition of <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  that my mother hand loaned her mother.</p>

          introducing sundar krishnan        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear</p>
<p>We have to give good respect to sundar krishnan, who collected historical novels. </p>
<p>Normally<br />books can be classified into two categories. one being basic<br />information on any subject and information could be obtained easily at<br />any point of time </p>
<p>The second type being the consolidation of the various information and it could be referred immediatly </p>
<p>The<br />first type we need not store or keep personnaly in our racks  the<br />reason being the information could be obtained easily at any point of<br />time. </p>
<p>The example for the second type is dictionery. It is not<br />possible to go to a library each time for seeing the dictionery. Is it<br />not? It should be in our personnel library.</p>
<p>The historical<br />novels are of dictionery type. They are not only telling about various<br />kings achievment and relations but also give indirect advise to the<br />readers in an abnormal circumstances.</p>
<p>Therefore such novels<br />necessarily to be in our personnel library. As an example ponniyin<br />selvan is like Ramayana as mentioned by sujatha. It not only speaks<br />about the hisotory of cholas but also  suggest the various ways to<br />behave in an abnormal circumstances. </p>
<p>Just imagine that you are<br />in a ship alone no body is available in a rough sea and the ship is<br />also caught fire. How to behave in such abnormal circumstances? What<br />vandya deven did? How he escaped? </p>

<p>In the sandilyan novels example kadal pura  we can find several indirect advices to the readers. </p>
<p>Naa.<br />parathasary' s kurinji malar, the hero behaves like Gandhi in an<br />abnormal cirucumstances and married the daughter of the villon.It is<br />also an indirect advise to the readers to adopt in their actual life,<br />when the cirucumstances warrents</p>
<p>Such books are necessarily to be available in our<br />personnel library and it could be referred immediatley at any time when<br />it required by us.  </p>
<p> Our sudnar krishnan is a great person and<br />have all historical books in his library. It is not possible for all us<br />to have all books, due to space, time, money etc. </p>
<p>I have already suggested three books which are necessarily to be availble in our personnel library.</p>
<p> I request the members to suggest the books which are necessarily to be in our library with the reasons for keeping the same.</p>
<p>Members may give their opinions.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear</p>
<p>We have to give good respect to sundar krishnan, who collected historical novels. </p>
<p>Normally books can be classified into two categories. one being basic information on any subject and information could be obtained easily at any pointof time </p>
<p>The second type being the consolidation of the various information and it could be referred immediatly </p>
<p>The first type we need not store or keep personnaly in our racks  the reason being the information could be obtained easily at any point of time. </p>
<p>The example for the second type is dictionery. It is not possible to go to a library each time for seeing the dictionery. Is it not? It should be in our personnel library.</p>
<p>The historical novels are of dictionery type. They are not only telling about various kings achievment and relations but also give indirect advise to the readers in an abnormal circumstances.</p>
<p>Therefore such novels necessarily to be in our personnel library. As an example ponniyin selvan is like Ramayana as mentioned by sujatha. It not only speaks about the hisotory of cholas but also  suggest the various waysto behave in an abnormal circumstances. </p>
<p>Just imagine that you are in a ship alone no body is available in a rough sea and the ship is also caught fire. How to behave in such abnormal circumstances? What vandya deven did? How he escaped? </p>

<p>    venketesh</p>
<p>    Dear Sir</p>
<p>    Thanks for your mail. PFA the list of my historical novel collections in<br />  pdf form. So for I have spent Rs. 45000 to collect / purchase these novels.<br />  60% of the novels purchased directly from publications / author. These<br />  project started in the year of 2006. So for 387 novels collected. Still<br />  pending is 40 novels which is having a problem that most of the novels are<br />  very old and not able to find the author address.</p>
<p>    I have to thank Easwary Lending library and 40% of the novels purchased<br />  from them due to out of stock in the publications. Also Nivethitha Mr.<br />  Swaminathan (SRS). He helped me a lot. In the mean time, I have to say my<br />  special thanks to Mr. Vikraman who is guided me in various time. When I<br />  start reading Kalki's novel in my college days I was admired by his flow.<br />  Also I noted that the historical novel shows how our ancient people live and<br />  their total living activities though it is some time over sided by some<br />  authors. At my early days I am unable to spend money to purchase and read<br />  the books. Not even novels but also my college books. I spend most of my<br />  timings in the college library and Sarasvathi Mahal library.</p>
<p>    Once I joined in the IT, I have decided to make it as a habit and met Mr.<br />  Vikraman, Mr. Kovi Manisekaran, Mr. Gowthama Neelambaran, Mr. Thivakar, Mr.<br />  Mukilan, Mr. Aikann and Mr. Viswaknesan. When I discussed with them, I<br />  understand that how much time they are taking to write a novel and also how<br />  much painful it is. To complete / write one historical novel, they have done<br />  a lot of research regarding the story main theme.</p>
<p>    I have asked them most of the novels are not re-published or after the<br />  author period, no one interested to re-publish the same. In that case whyit<br />  is not computerized. Mr. Thivakar replied that some of the new writers they<br />  are preserving the DTP work in CD format. But old novels?? No answer for<br />  this.</p>
<p>    If you take Mr. Lakshmi narayanan.Y. and Mr. Somu most of the novels are<br />  not available.</p>
<p>    This is the story of my interest in the historical novel collection. Last<br />  but not least Novles are the good friend rather than a man hood. It is not<br />  expecting any thing from me. Only thing I have to preserve them and spend<br />  few rupees. When ever I required, it will talk to me.</p>
<p>    Thanks and Regards</p>

        <p>Hi<br />this is the time to ask yourself<br />how many historical novels - tamil do you own</p>
<p>i personally have 4 of other authors.<br />mainly vengaiyin mainthan, seraman kathali, kalki - 3 novels, nandipurathu nayagi,</p>
<p>venketesh</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi all<br />  we have a silent achiever in this group.<br />  a man who has quietly gone about collecting tamil historical novels.<br />  i post here his mail to me</p>
<p>  venketesh</p>
<p>  Dear Sir</p>
<p>  Thanks for your mail. PFA the list of my historical novel collections inpdf form. So for I have spent Rs. 45000 to collect / purchase these novels. 60% of the novels purchased directly from publications / author. Theseproject started in the year of 2006. So for 387 novels collected. Still pending is 40 novels which is having a problem that most of the novels arevery old and not able to find the author address.</p>
<p>  I have to thank Easwary Lending library and 40% of the novels purchased from them due to out of stock in the publications. Also Nivethitha Mr. Swaminathan (SRS). He helped me a lot. In the mean time, I have to say my special thanks to Mr. Vikraman who is guided me in various time. When I start reading Kalki's novel in my college days I was admired by his flow. AlsoI noted that the historical novel shows how our ancient people live and their total living activities though it is some time over sided by some authors. At my early days I am unable to spend money to purchase and read the books. Not even novels but also my college books. I spend most of my timings in the college library and Sarasvathi Mahal library.</p>
<p>  Once I joined in the IT, I have decided to make it as a habit and met Mr.Vikraman, Mr. Kovi Manisekaran, Mr. Gowthama Neelambaran, Mr. Thivakar, Mr. Mukilan, Mr. Aikann and Mr. Viswaknesan. When I discussed with them, I understand that how much time they are taking to write a novel and also how much painful it is. To complete / write one historical novel, they have done a lot of research regarding the story main theme.   </p>
<p>  I have asked them most of the novels are not re-published or after the author period, no one interested to re-publish the same. In that case why itis not computerized. Mr. Thivakar replied that some of the new writers they are preserving the DTP work in CD format. But old novels?? No answerfor this. </p>
<p>  If you take Mr. Lakshmi narayanan.Y. and Mr. Somu most of the novels are not available.</p>
<p>  This is the story of my interest in the historical novel collection. Last but not least Novles are the good friend rather than a man hood. It is not expecting any thing from me. Only thing I have to preserve them and spend few rupees. When ever I required, it will talk to me.</p>
<p>  Thanks and Regards</p>
<p>  Sundar Krishnan</p>
