        <p>Hi Vijay</p>
<p>I never said queen or queen mother.<br />But I guess she was the first wife of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ( and a non politiccal <br />marriage at that)<br />vanavan madevi was certainly the mother of rajendra though he later <br />built a palli padai for his stepmother.</acronym></p>

<p>    ===================<br />    how vanathi was in reality I dont know. remember she was <br />connected <br />      with two of our greates kings, a wife of one and mother of <br />another.<br />    =====================</p>
<p>    Idhu dhan Venkat podum thoondil (bait).</p>
<p>  hi venkat, </p>
<p>  1) she was connected as a wife to a king !!! nope...a king in <br />waiting <br />  perhaps - remember kalki's last lines in ps post script....</p>
<p>  point 8 - kudanthai jothidarin kootrugal vanathiyin visayathil <br />  palikinrana.. ( sothiar sastiram parthu sonnara? oogithuch sonnara? <br />  naam ariyom) vanathikk pirakkum kuzanthaiyaana rajendran 'gangiyum <br />  kadaramum konda chozan" any pirkala sarithirathil pugaz perugiraan.</p>

<p>  2) as mother to a king - nope ! again -- as per above if she was <br />not <br />  alive to take the throne with RRC, she couldnt have been the mother <br />of <br />  even a prince/let alone a king...<br />  tks to sps sir, earlier you had clarified my doubt about how sure <br />we <br />  were of vanathi being the mother of RJC...by pointing out the <br />  inscriptions as .....bhivanamadevi thiruvayirudhitha Rajendra. <br />danti <br />  sakthi vitangi was RRC patamahishi ( but what does danti sakthi <br />  vidangi mean....) </p>

        <p>Thought I will poke my nose Nandhini / Poonguzhali's mamiyar ...But with<br />Shoba writing more about this ... I also join the party. Will be happy even<br />if my point is snubbed. My observation -- In the long run, in real life is<br />that docile (Thats not the correct word) can I use calm women achieve more<br />in life than people like Kundhavi / Poonguzhali.</p>
<p>Will write more if this topic continues ...</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>thirunavukarasu avarkal also has a daughter called vanathi.<br />suprabalan, leading book editor who has helped bring out more books <br />on kalki than anybody else has named his daughter pungkuzhali.<br />our sps calls his daughter nandini.</p>

<p>hi venkat, </p>
<p>1) she was connected as a wife to a king !!! nope...a king in waiting <br />perhaps - remember kalki's last lines in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  post script....</p>

<p>2) as mother to a king - nope ! again -- as per above if she was not <br />alive to take the throne with <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , she couldnt have been the mother of <br />even a prince/let alone a king...<br />tks to sps sir, earlier you had clarified my doubt about how sure we <br />were of vanathi being the mother of <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym ...by pointing out the <br />inscriptions as .....bhivanamadevi thiruvayirudhitha Rajendra. danti <br />sakthi vitangi was <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  patamahishi ( but what does danti sakthi <br />vidangi mean....) </acronym></acronym></acronym></p>

        <p>Venkat Sir,</p>
<p>Very good informations.</p>
<p>thank you very much.</p>

<p>  Kalki's greatest hobby when he shifted to chennai was to sit in <br />the <br />  marina beach and listen to the waves.</p>
<p>  and speaking of rasigamani TKC, along with rajaji and thiruvika <br />were <br />  the greatest influences on kalki. </p>
<p>  I wouldnt include sadasivam for I think kalki saw his relation <br />ship <br />  with sadasivam as a strategic partnership.<br />  even this year ponniyin selvan must have sold 10 thousand copies <br />in <br />  the bookfair.but do you know how many books kalki sold of his <br />first <br />  book( sarathaiyin thanthiram i think).<br />  in his own words 4 and a half. one book was sold at half rate. <br />kalki <br />  just could not take his genius to the masses because he was not a <br />  commercial man.<br />  sadasivam was to kalki what he had lost in vasan.<br />  vasan and sadasivam brought kalki into the limelight which still <br />  illuminates him.</p>
<p>  venketesh</p>
<p>    Our dear members Kamal - Lavanya - Pavithra - Ram - (Krupa ?) - <br />Dr. <br />    Kalaikkovan - Dr. Nalini and myself - sitting around scatterdly <br />  near <br />    the Maamallapuram Seashore temple - on a Pournami night - (about <br />3 <br />  - <br />    4 years back) could distantly hear that "Alai osi ", discussed <br />    Sivakamiyin Sabatham &amp; Pallava details, PS and RRC details and <br />were <br />    transcended to that ERA and deep in my heart I was murmering the <br />    above lines of Kalki - through Poonguzhali ..</p>
<p>    Kalki used to visit the Maamallai shore temple along with <br />  Rasigamani <br />    TKC ( who is expert in enjoying and experessing finer parts of <br />    literature, arts, conversation etc.)</p>
<p>    Dear Venkat, that is excellent information. thank you.</p>

<p>      Hi<br />      forgot one important info</p>
<p>      in the last hours of kalki's life he had the wish to hear a <br />few <br />    good <br />      songs. first MS came and sang a few devotional songs. next <br />anandhi<br />    ( <br />      kalki's daughter came and sang a song from sivakamiyin <br />sabatham. <br />      finally kalki's wish was she sing the song of pungkuzhali( <br />that <br />      poignant song evoking all our deepest emotions.<br />      THAT was the last thing kalki heard, before he went into a <br />sleep <br />    from <br />      which he would never awaken.</p>

<blockquote><p>  " Alaikadalum Oyndhirukka<br />  Ahakkadal dhan ponguvadhen ? "</p></blockquote>
<p>Kalki's greatest hobby when he shifted to chennai was to sit in the <br />marina beach and listen to the waves.</p>
<p>and speaking of rasigamani TKC, along with rajaji and thiruvika were <br />the greatest influences on kalki. </p>
<p>I wouldnt include sadasivam for I think kalki saw his relation ship <br />with sadasivam as a strategic partnership.<br />even this year ponniyin selvan must have sold 10 thousand copies in <br />the bookfair.but do you know how many books kalki sold of his first <br />book( sarathaiyin thanthiram i think).<br />in his own words 4 and a half. one book was sold at half rate. kalki <br />just could not take his genius to the masses because he was not a <br />commercial man.<br />sadasivam was to kalki what he had lost in vasan.<br />vasan and sadasivam brought kalki into the limelight which still <br />illuminates him.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Our dear members Kamal - Lavanya - Pavithra - Ram - (Krupa ?) - Dr. <br />  Kalaikkovan - Dr. Nalini and myself - sitting around scatterdly <br />near <br />  the Maamallapuram Seashore temple - on a Pournami night - (about 3 <br />- <br />  4 years back) could distantly hear that "Alai osi ", discussed <br />  Sivakamiyin Sabatham &amp; Pallava details, PS and RRC details and were <br />  transcended to that ERA and deep in my heart I was murmering the <br />  above lines of Kalki - through Poonguzhali ..</p>
<p>  Kalki used to visit the Maamallai shore temple along with <br />Rasigamani <br />  TKC ( who is expert in enjoying and experessing finer parts of <br />  literature, arts, conversation etc.)</p>
<p>  Dear Venkat, that is excellent information. thank you.</p>

<p>    in the last hours of kalki's life he had the wish to hear a few <br />  good <br />    songs. first MS came and sang a few devotional songs. next anandhi<br />  ( <br />    kalki's daughter came and sang a song from sivakamiyin sabatham. <br />    finally kalki's wish was she sing the song of pungkuzhali( that <br />    poignant song evoking all our deepest emotions.<br />    THAT was the last thing kalki heard, before he went into a sleep <br />  from <br />    which he would never awaken.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>vanathi was the docile, ideal daughter, ideal daughter in law types.<br />that could be the naming reason.<br />kunthavai mathiyo pungkuzhali maathiyo marumagal maattuchunaa, <br />maamiyaar gathi ennavaagum?( sorry if I sound like a MCP- just a joke)</p>
<p>how vanathi was in reality I dont know. remember she was connected <br />with two of our greates kings, a wife of one and mother of another.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Why did KALKI picturise VAANATHI that way, in the First Place ?</p>
<p>  And why Personalities like THIRUNAVUKKARASU - Leading Publisher of <br />  Tamilnadu - who is the Pioneer in bringing out Tamil culture - <br />  Literature - traditional value based books - tended to name his <br />  Publishing house - after VAANATHI ?  </p></blockquote>
<p>thirunavukarasu avarkal also has a daughter called vanathi.<br />suprabalan, leading book editor who has helped bring out more books <br />on kalki than anybody else has named his daughter pungkuzhali.<br />our sps calls his daughter nandini.</p>

<p>==========================</p>
<p>Why did KALKI picturise VAANATHI that way, in the First Place ?</p>
<p>And why Personalities like THIRUNAVUKKARASU - Leading Publisher of <br />Tamilnadu - who is the Pioneer in bringing out Tamil culture - <br />Literature - traditional value based books - tended to name his <br />Publishing house - after VAANATHI ?  </p>
<p>For instance Carnatic music Legend S. Ramanthan's one of the <br />daughters is Vaanathi .. </p>
<p>Several such personalities have developed pride in inducting <br />Vaanathi in their Life..</p>
<p>Yet obviously Vaanathi is not picturised as a Heroine !</p>
<p>Pls enlighten.</p>

        <p>hi nithya</p>
<p>search our archives - we did a series comparing nandhini to <br />cleopatra and even a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of three musketeers etc etc </p>
<p>however, i differ on poonguzali - it was one of the strongest lady <br />characters ( apart from kundavai ofcourse) of kalki. remember the <br />beating away of the leapard with just a shark bone episode. i really <br />liked the way she put the fear of god in our <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  while showing him <br />her lovers ( kolli vai pisasu).. strong willed and when she knew <br />arulmozhi was out of bounds, instead of sulking and dying like <br />manimekalai, she lived her life. it take guts to stand up to life's <br />beatings and still coming up trumps....</acronym></p>
<p>lets bring in sivagami from <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  and kundavi from <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym  as well.. how <br />would they fare in comparison...one an eg for love failure and the <br />other success</acronym></p>

<p>the metal chess was between Nandhini and Kundavai..<br />i don?t how far Nadhini could have been kalki's imaginative fragment...<br />he should have surely had some real life time instances to be script such acharacter..dark, enigmatic....</p>

<p>-Hi<br />shobha you missed diwaker baskaran by a couple of years. check the <br />archives for his comments on vanathi, pungkuzhali etc.<br />vanathi he used to call as " nadaka mayil"<br />for pungkuzhali he had the choicest of scoldings. loosu he used to say</p>

<p>    but did you notice, we all hated Ak to some extent, punkuzhali <br />was <br />    irritable to the core in some places.<br />    kalki was not writing about these charecters, he was actually <br />  living <br />    with them.</p>

<p>while researching for kalki's biography i found 2 years in his life <br />the most interesting.<br />1941, and 1954.</p>
<p>41 he started with his resignation from vikadan on jan 1.<br />went to jail on jan 21<br />and had his own magazine by august.</p>
<p>54 also he has achieved a lot.<br />i wanted to spend more time going into detail about his writings in <br />his last year for i was convinced that with his bad health and being <br />in and out of hospital he knew his end was nearing.</p>
<p>but then it went out the purview of the biography i was planing. some <br />day I shall do it.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  HI sps</p>
<p>  i dont think kalki wanted to continue ps.<br />  though he left openings.<br />  ===========<br />Dear Venkat,</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess We do think almost on similar lines ..</p>
<p>1. the period chosesn : Fiction : 969 AD. Less of history evidenced - <br />giving freedom to writer (as you yourself observed in the foreward of <br />Thillaiyil oru Kolliakkaran - btw that is marvellous work !)</p>
<p>2. the period chosen : to write the Novel : Parthiban Kanavu : Thirst <br />for Freedom of an oppressed Prince. Contemporary freedom movement was <br />expressed through Thiagaboomi. Ponniyinselvan is a luxurious dream .. <br />say post independence (as Kalki commenced in 1950).</p>
<p>3. Re Vasan : I agree with you. Imagine Chandraleka .. Almost after 60 <br />years, AVM's Sivaji is being compared having been filmed to such MEGA <br />scale.. IF ONLY someone Ventured to have taken <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  as movie those <br />years, OTHER THAN <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  VASAN, the granduer should have exceeded <br />Chandraleka.. Yet think of the costumes for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  - Kundavai - <br />Vandhiyathevan - Vanathi - Madurantakan :: Less than Royal ! Nandhini <br />would have become costlier among the lot.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>4. NOW IMAGINE THE REAL ROYAL LOT OF <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  - KUNDAVAI - VANDHIYATHEVAN - <br />VANATHI (post MADURANTAKAN Era). PROBABLY KALKI WOULD HAVE PREFERRED <br />TO UNLEASH THIS MEGA SCALE DRAMA .. LATER.. for he could not have <br />foreseen his end so quickly !</acronym></p>
<p>5. And we do concurr on the abrupt ending of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  .. since Kalki himself <br />need to clarify several things after completing the series.</acronym></p>

<p>HI sps</p>
<p>i dont think kalki wanted to continue ps.<br />though he left openings.</p>
<p>he perhaps knew he had limited time and wanted to finish amarathara.<br />there was no other reason for him to end ps so abruptly and start a <br />new project.</p>
<p>amarathara was initially written as a screenplay for a movie.<br />kalki the super man always seemed to suffer from a complex when he <br />compared himself with s.s vasan. wanted to beat vasan in all fields. <br />it was a sort of race kalki set for himself.<br />and after the beating thyagaboomi took at the press( not the box <br />office) kalki laid down quiet. <br />perhaps amarathara was his life's project to equal vasan.<br />what a pity PS had to suffer because of this.</p>

<p>remember what kalki says at the end of his book</p>
<p>amarabhujangan is killed in batle by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .<br />the small boy who calls nandini as amma is later killed by <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym .</p>
<p>kandamaran serves the chola empire and takes his sambuvarayar kulam <br />to great heights.</p>
<p>just imagine the reality scenario.</p>
<p>pandyas battling it out from the jungle for centuries, and wining at <br />the end. I remember DR.Jaybees article "indomitable pandyas"<br />a hundred women like nandini must have participated in this war. <br />kalki was just paying a subtle tribute to them.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The never ending discussion of Nandini again :).</p>
<p>Nandini is one of characters Kalki has given a glimpse from the birth,<br />childhood, adulthood. The changes in Nandini would be very clearly<br />shown through the course of the novel. Even Kundavi would mention that<br />to Pazhivettaiyar in book 5 that Nandini was forced to become evil by<br />everyone around her in her childhood. The reason why Kalki did not<br />kill Nandini in the end would have been explained by himself. He would<br />have linked her death with the delay in the convicting Ravidasan gang<br />for AK's murder.</p>
