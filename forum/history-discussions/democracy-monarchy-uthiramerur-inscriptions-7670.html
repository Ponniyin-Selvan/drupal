<p>  Hi Maloo</p>
<p>  a slight detour.</p>
<p>  I was doing a small piece on creativity enhancement.</p>
<p>  i came across the concept of bicycle.</p>
<p>  actually i was probing which great inventors were bicycle mechanics otherthan the wright brothers.</p>
<p>  i had bit more than what i had bagained for.</p>
<p>  the history of the bicycle has so much of female emancipation in europe giving them the freedom of movement.</p>
<p>  one social scientist went onto say the bicycle had done more for women liberation than any other contraption invented.</p>

<p>    Actually Venkat it really does not matter who does. I know women have had place sof power i just wanted to know exactly what you said on England, if voting rights were there and if they could be voted to power that is all.</p>
<p>    Thanks!!</p>

<p>      yours was a technical question but i sensed a small streak of concernon women rights withing.</p>
<p>      but do you think women rulers are going to improve the conditions of wome.</p>
<p>      we have had women rulers( queens and PMs) in lands where the emancipation of women was the slowest.</p>
<p>      a piece of trivia- we had queens in england before women were allowedto vote.</p>

        <p>Our system is bad, yes, but that doesn't obscure the fact that we have talent. A cursory glance at history will show you that the older the civilisation, the greater the contribution. Have you counted the number of Jewish geniuses? And Judaism is like 4500 years old. We just had the misfortune of having feckless rulers who couldn't distinguish between "veera vilayattu" andthe ruthless conquerors who meant business.</p>
<p>"Basically KARMA (performance without expecting benefit) has gone into our BLOOD .. from time immemorial.. ."</p>
<p>Yeah, basically we had this habit of attributing everything we do to divineblessings. When will our philosophers realize that God is only a way of dealing with uncertainties, insecurities and thousand other things that come in the way of pure thought? </p>
<p>In a way it isn't bad. Knowledge belongs to all. Only, i wouldn't be too pleased when somebody steals my paper and announces it as his. The only thingthat keeps a scientist going is recognition. A.R.Rahman can do without Oscars, but what if someone steals his music? Will he put it all on Karma and keep playing? Once again a case of not protecting our own.</p>
<p>I don't give a damn about recognition in the field of arts. It's the fans recognition that matters, the one and only indicator of a true mastero. It'sa matter of taste and A.R.Rahman will remain immortal because of the transcendence of his music, oscar or no oscar. Everybody knows "Slumdog Mill.." was not even close to his best. </p>
<p>What i'm saying hereafter is totally out of the blue. Just a stray thought.</p>
<p>I'm saying that achievements in the field of knowledge belong to humankind.Science is one area where we need to breakdown all barriers. But never ever deny due recognition for a scientist. He might have contributed to mankind, but it was HE who did it. We must learn to stand up for them and not brush it off as karma. Marconi stole the radio from J.C.Bose and told blatantly that he did it. If somebody did that to me and my country didn't speak for me, i'd go to where my talents are recognized.</p>
<p>The ideal way is: Subsidise education globally under a common agency. The UN can do this, because it's no good at politics. I'm sure most countries would be glad to wash educational responsibility off their hands. People who deal with knowledge shouldn't have to think about sourcing money. Recognition by his peers is the ultimate reward. </p>
<p>The pursuit of knowledge has the ability to bring the world together. It isthe only common cause the world can agree upon. The practitioners of the pure sciences belong to one brotherhood and it is in interests of mankind that no barriers exist between them.</p>
<p>This is a kind of rant, so please bear with me..</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>On Sunday 12 Jul 2009 11:11:48 am Walsingham wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  I was just wondering why this system never became popular? We do have a<br />  record of lost legacies. We are the original inventors of the arabic<br />  numeral system, we discovered calculus before newton, we were the<br />  inspiration for the greek philosophy and now we are one of the forerunners<br />  of democracy. Why are we never given credit for such things? Why was Gandhi<br />  never given Nobel Peace Prize? Why wasn't Dr. George Sudarshan recognised?</p>
<p>  Are we too modest, too diffident? Or were we just too maganimous when<br />  others infringed our copyright, so to speak? Oh, this is cool, are we the<br />  forerunners of free and open source knowledge philosophy?</p></blockquote>
<p>To answer at least one question, Gandhi was never given the Peace Prize <br />because he was scheduled to get it in 1948, but he was shot before it couldbe <br />awarded. There's a condition in Alfred Nobel's will that says that only living <br />persons should be awarded the prize. The 1948 prize was _not_ awarded because <br />"there was no suitable living candidate". They definitely had decided to give <br />him the prize (which they'd failed to do until then), but they tried to make <br />up for it.<br />(<a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html" title="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html</a> for a <br />citation)...</p>
<p>With regards to science and technology, this is definitely a field in whichwe <br />lag today. Most (not all, obviously) of our scientific "achievements" over the <br />last few decades seem to be aping the results of others, not original work. <br />This is mostly due to lack of funding for research. We lack good courses in <br />either pure or applied sciences at the university level (as opposed to <br />engineering and technology courses). Arts and science colleges are considered <br />a step (or three) below "good" engineering colleges, with diluted syllabus and <br />lackluster staff. I don't expect any great leaps and bounds from this system <br />as it stands...</p>

Why are we never given credit for such things? Why was Gandhi never given Nobel Peace Prize? Why wasn't Dr. George Sudarshan recognised? </p>
<p>    Are we too modest, too diffident? Or were we just too maganimous when others infringed our copyright, so to speak? Oh, this is cool, are we the forerunners of free and open source knowledge philosophy?<br />  -------</p>
<p>  Dear WS,</p>
<p>  Why WE - Indians are not duly recognised .. </p>
<p>  Basically KARMA (performance without expecting benefit) has gone into ourBLOOD .. from time immemorial...</p>
<p>  Let us look at other things too ::</p>
<p>  Hemamalini actress was turned down in tamil filmdom ... She has become aLegend in Bollywood... Similarly popularity of Sridevi, Asin now.... But with Actors it is reverse.. Rajni - Kamal could not become so popular.. May be there are various parameters for recognition and popularity too.</p>
<p>  our AR Rahman ... look into Our Archieves . so much we discussed.<br />  OSCAR label has made so tall ... tho' Ilayaraja's symphony did bring him fame -not this popularity ...</p>
<p>  We know when Actor Kamal spoke of Oscar award last year - he opined that was not ultimate recognition ...</p>
<p>  Gandhi did not get Nobel prize .. but there is NO OTHER MAHATHMA in thisWorld.</p></deranggen@></p></blockquote>
<p>Our dear member TR Shashwat has given the link that Gandhiji did not get Noble prize - as he was shot dear prior to that..</p>

<p>Thank you .. </p>
<p>Our History books are VOID of pronouncing our very RICH HERITAGE ...<br />and these informations confine only to very few seekers.</p>
<p>" Dassi " word never existed (or atleast used) 10 Centuries back... </p>
<p>THALI CHERI PENDIR INSCRIPTIONs are very famous in the big temple...<br />Though some (Writers) used to equate the word NAKKAN (in Tamil) with dassi - it was absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>Nakkan - was used for male and female.<br />Nakkan was used for Official and a Queen too.</p>
<p>This word Nakkan frequently figures in the Thalicheri inscriptions in the Bigtemple.. (Nothern Compund Outer - easily about 300 feet long .. Dr. Kalaikkovan has published a book on this... It describes of the Two Wings allocated to the Women-folk attending various tasks in the including dance - music and other art related.</p>
<p>in THALI (Temple) CHERI (RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS ) Each wing had about 48 houses ..<br />Each house was allocated to the best of the THALICHERI PENDIR from various Other Temples like Thiruvarur etc.,</p>
<p>Payment - Leave vacancy - Leave salary - formation of Team - filling absentees / resignations etc., were left to the related THALICHERI PENDIR themselves....Administrative Establishment never inerfered...</p>
<p>THALICHERY PENDIR were accorded Royal Treatment !</p>
<p>Let us say a musician has to leave in hurry .. he / she has to identify the replacement / their Chief Pendir will identify based on the requirement and merit !!</p>

<p>Dear WS,</p>
<p>Why WE - Indians are not duly recognised .. </p>
<p>Basically KARMA (performance without expecting benefit) has gone into our BLOOD .. from time immemorial...</p>
<p>Let us look at other things too ::</p>
<p>Hemamalini actress was turned down in tamil filmdom ... She has become a Legend in Bollywood... Similarly popularity of Sridevi, Asin now.... But with Actors it is reverse.. Rajni - Kamal could not become so popular.. May bethere are various parameters for recognition and popularity too.</p>
<p>our AR Rahman ... look into Our Archieves . so much we discussed.<br />OSCAR label has made so tall ... tho' Ilayaraja's symphony did bring him fame -not this popularity ...</p>
<p>We know when Actor Kamal spoke of Oscar award last year - he opined that was not ultimate recognition ...</p>
<p>Gandhi did not get Nobel prize .. but there is NO OTHER MAHATHMA in this World.</p>

<p>    Dear SPS, I very much enjoyed reading this link and will check out Dr Nagasamy's website today, thank you!!</p>
<p>    Just curious to know - is there any reference of women being voted to power through this system, are there any caste/hierarchies among people likeso and so can vote and so and so cannot, what age was considered adulthood- would be very interesting to know all that and how it compares to the present day world.</p>
<p>  ============ =======</p>
<p>  Dear Malathi,</p>
<p>  Women being voted to Power ?</p>
<p>  Good question... Will definitely look for for more details and revert onthis.</p>
<p>  However - there were women-officials - AHIKARICHINIs !</p>
<p>  And RRC wife Panchavanmadevi' s SERVANT MAID had granted Golden Flower (Porppoo) - to Thirunavukkarasar (@ Appar) in Thiruppugalur Temple and this grant is recorded in the inscriptions !!</p>
<p>  Servant maid had the affordability &amp; will to grant and the King had the heart to inscribe - which we recall even after 1000 yrs !</p>
<p>  Likewise from THIRUVAIYARU inscriptions we reaslie ::</p>
<p>  (Kind Attention :: Shoba - Narendran - Satheesh .. )</p>
<p>  Cultivable land was scarce in Chola empire during RRC / RjC. (Means optimum utility carriedout. Rice export should have been peak) Reclamation of land from Cuvery bed was regular practice (ref: Pazhuvur - near Gunaseelam /trichy inscriptions too).. such reclaimed land was PUT ON AUCTION.. by theEstablishment .. </p>
<p>  NOT JUST ACQUIRED FOR PUBLIC PURPOSE !</p>
<p>  And the highest bidders were ::</p>
<p>  Kundavai Vandiyathevan - sister of the Emperor.</p>
<p>  Olagamadevi Rajarajan - Crown Empress of the Emperor.</p>
<p>  They PAID the Auction Bid, and handed-over the LANDS AS GRANTS TO THE TEMPLE !!</p>
<p>  Even though THEY WERE IN POWER they DID NOT ACQUIRE THE LANDS !!</p>
<p>  We have been also reading of the contributions of Sembian madevi already..</p>

<p>To answer at least one question, Gandhi was never given the Peace Prize <br />because he was scheduled to get it in 1948, but he was shot before it could be <br />awarded. There's a condition in Alfred Nobel's will that says that only living <br />persons should be awarded the prize. The 1948 prize was _not_ awarded because <br />"there was no suitable living candidate". They definitely had decided to give <br />him the prize (which they'd failed to do until then), but they tried to make <br />up for it.<br />(<a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html" title="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html</a> for a <br />citation)...</p>
<p>With regards to science and technology, this is definitely a field in which we <br />lag today. Most (not all, obviously) of our scientific "achievements" over the <br />last few decades seem to be aping the results of others, not original work. <br />This is mostly due to lack of funding for research. We lack good courses in <br />either pure or applied sciences at the university level (as opposed to <br />engineering and technology courses). Arts and science colleges are considered <br />a step (or three) below "good" engineering colleges, with diluted syllabus and <br />lackluster staff. I don't expect any great leaps and bounds from this system <br />as it stands...</p>

        <p>Dear SPS, what a treasury of info thank you!!</p>
<p>May I ask how is a 'Ahikarichini' referred to - what were her duties/responsiblities? </p>
<p>Also is there a word like this for servant maid - maybe she was a professional 'maid' like they have in the west :)) who serviced royal families, or a'daasi' of some kind?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>    Just curious to know - is there any reference of women being voted to power through this system, are there any caste/hierarchies among people likeso and so can vote and so and so cannot, what age was considered adulthood- would be very interesting to know all that and how it compares to the present day world.<br />  ===================<br />  Dear Malathi,</p>
<p>  Women being voted to Power ?</p>
<p>  Good question... Will definitely look for for more details and revert onthis.</p>
<p>  However - there were women-officials - AHIKARICHINIs !</p>
<p>  And RRC wife Panchavanmadevi's SERVANT MAID had granted Golden Flower (Porppoo) - to Thirunavukkarasar (@ Appar) in Thiruppugalur Temple and this grant is recorded in the inscriptions !!</p>
<p>  Servant maid had the affordability &amp; will to grant and the King had the heart to inscribe - which we recall even after 1000 yrs !</p>
<p>  Likewise from THIRUVAIYARU inscriptions we reaslie ::</p>
<p>  (Kind Attention :: Shoba - Narendran - Satheesh .. )</p>
<p>  Cultivable land was scarce in Chola empire during RRC / RjC. (Means optimum utility carriedout. Rice export should have been peak) Reclamation of land from Cuvery bed was regular practice (ref: Pazhuvur - near Gunaseelam /trichy inscriptions too).. such reclaimed land was PUT ON AUCTION.. by theEstablishment .. <br />  NOT JUST ACQUIRED FOR PUBLIC PURPOSE !</p>
<p>  And the highest bidders were ::</p>
<p>  Kundavai Vandiyathevan - sister of the Emperor.<br />  Olagamadevi Rajarajan - Crown Empress of the Emperor.</p>
<p>  They PAID the Auction Bid, and handed-over the LANDS AS GRANTS TO THE TEMPLE !!</p>
<p>  Even though THEY WERE IN POWER they DID NOT ACQUIRE THE LANDS !!</p>

        <p>I was just wondering why this system never became popular? We do have a record of lost legacies. We are the original inventors of the arabic numeral system, we discovered calculus before newton, we were the inspiration for the greek philosophy and now we are one of the forerunners of democracy. Why are we never given credit for such things? Why was Gandhi never given NobelPeace Prize? Why wasn't Dr. George Sudarshan recognised? </p>
<p>Are we too modest, too diffident? Or were we just too maganimous when others infringed our copyright, so to speak? Oh, this is cool, are we the forerunners of free and open source knowledge philosophy?</p>

<p>Dear Malathi,</p>
<p>Women being voted to Power ?</p>
<p>Good question... Will definitely look for for more details and revert on this.</p>
<p>However - there were women-officials - AHIKARICHINIs !</p>
<p>And <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  wife Panchavanmadevi's SERVANT MAID had granted Golden Flower (Porppoo) - to Thirunavukkarasar (@ Appar) in Thiruppugalur Temple and this grant is recorded in the inscriptions !!</p>
<p>Servant maid had the affordability &amp; will to grant and the King had the heart to inscribe - which we recall even after 1000 yrs !</p>
<p>Likewise from THIRUVAIYARU inscriptions we reaslie ::</p>
<p>(Kind Attention :: Shoba - Narendran - Satheesh .. )</p>
<p>Cultivable land was scarce in Chola empire during <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  / <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym . (Means optimumutility carriedout. Rice export should have been peak) Reclamation of land from Cuvery bed was regular practice (ref: Pazhuvur - near Gunaseelam / trichy inscriptions too).. such reclaimed land was PUT ON AUCTION.. by the Establishment .. <br />NOT JUST ACQUIRED FOR PUBLIC PURPOSE !</acronym></p>
<p>And the highest bidders were ::</p>
<p>Kundavai Vandiyathevan - sister of the Emperor.<br />Olagamadevi Rajarajan - Crown Empress of the Emperor.</p>
<p>They PAID the Auction Bid, and handed-over the LANDS AS GRANTS TO THE TEMPLE !!</p>
<p>Even though THEY WERE IN POWER they DID NOT ACQUIRE THE LANDS !!</p>
<p>We have been also reading of the contributions of Sembian madevi already.</p>
<p>regards/ sps</p>
