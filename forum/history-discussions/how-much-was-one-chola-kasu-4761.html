</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Interested to know the cost of living in chozhar kalam: from below <br />inscription:</p>
<p>These endowments were made in the following manner. Kundavaiyar <br />deposited certain sums of money (kasu), which were subsequently <br />borrowed on interest by the inhabitants of certain villages from the <br />shrine of Chandesvara (paragrah 1), the saint in whose name the <br />money affairs of temples are generally transacted.[3] The interest <br />had to be paid yearly into the treasury of the Rajarajesvara temple <br />at Tanjavur either in paddy[4] or in money. In the former case, the <br />interest was three kuruni of paddy for each kasu, and in the latter <br />12Â½ per cent. If it assumed that the rate of interest was the same <br />in both cases, one kasu would correspond to the value of 24 kuruni <br />or 2 kalam of paddy . </p>
<p>one kuruni - is approx 8 kgs of rice. so one kasu got you 192 kilos <br />of rice....wow</p>
<p>In two instances (paragraphs 18 and 21), money was deposited for <br />purchasing a number of sheep, from the milk of which two private <br />individuals had to supply daily a certain amount of ghee for lamps.<br />[5] The value of one sheep was reckoned as 1/3 kasu. Or one Kasu <br />got you 3 sheep.</p>
<p>3 sheep = 192 kilosof rice.</p>
<p>How does it compare with current day kasu, cost of kilo of rice and <br />one sheep...</p>
<p>Tamil Inscriptions</p>
<p>part - i</p>
<p>INSCRIPTIONS OF THE TANJAVUR TEMPLE</p>
<p>INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE</p>
<p>No. 6 On the South Wall second tier</p>
<p>This and the next inscription, though of different date, are <br />engraved continuously in two sections. No. 6 fills the whole of the <br />first section and part of the first line of the second section.</p>
<p>The inscription describes a number of gifts, which were made until <br />the 29th year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, alias <br />Rajarajadeva, by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar, who was the elder <br />sister of Rajarajadeva and the queen of Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar. <br />As, according to the large Leyden grant,[1] Rajaraja was the son of <br />Parantaka II. It is evident that the name of his sister, Parantakan <br />Kundavaiyar, is an abbreviation for Parantakan magal Kundavaiyar, <br />i.e., Kundavaiyar, the daughter of Parantaka (II.).</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 records a gift of gold to the same two goddesses, who <br />are mentioned in the inscription No.2.[2] According to paragraph 1, <br />these two images had been set up in the temple of Rajarajesvara by <br />Kundaaiyar herhself. The same princess had set up an image of her <br />mother, to which she presented certain ornaments (paragraphs 3 to <br />5). Other ornaments were given to the image of the god Dakshina-Meru-<br />Vitankar (paragraphs 6 and 7), which had been set up by king <br />Rajarajadeva (paragraph 1), and to his consort (paragraphs 8 and 9), <br />who was one of the two goddesses referred to in paragraph 2. The <br />remainder of the inscription treats of endowments to these two <br />goddesses (paragraph 10), to the image of Ponmaligaittunjina-devar <br />(paragraph 14), and to the image of the mother of Kundavaiyar <br />(paragraph 19).  </p>

<p>  The emblem of a "tiger facing two fish" was adopted by Uttam Chola <br />  (973-985) of Thanjavur in ThamilNadu. The seated tiger represented <br />  the Chola homeland, and the fish for the Pandya conquest. The fish <br />  on the Pandyan coins are horizontal (swimming) and in this case <br />  vertical (dead). The title Yuddhamalla was adopted by RajaRaja <br />  Chola's son Rajendra Chola (1014-1044). Rajaraja Chola invaded <br />Lanka <br />  in 990 AD and conquered the northern half. Ruining Anuradhapura he <br />  made Polonnaruwa his capital on the island;. Rajendra Chola <br />  succeeded in extended Chola occupation over the whole island of <br />  Lanka in 1018. The "seated king" design of Lankan massa became the <br />  model for subsequent Chola coins. Lanka became regained <br />independence <br />  from Chola occupation in 1070 under Vijaya-bahu (1055-1110). </p>
<p>  The design is that of the traditional Lanka type massa.<br />  Obverse : Standing king with torch on left and group of spheres on <br />  right, surmounted by crescent.

<p>    check this site - its got an excellant collection of chola <br />coins -<br />    with good description of what has been embossed....</p>
<p>    In the later part of the tenth century, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and <br />  Sri <br />    Lanka kingdoms adopted coinage once again after a brief break of <br />    four centuries. But this time, it triggered off with the gold <br />    coinage to initiate major transactions. Soon silver and copper <br />    coinage were minted in plenty to meet the day to day needs of <br />    commodities. </p>
<p>    Raja raja Chola struck coins both in Sri Lanka and India. They <br />    differed much in fabric, style and in the gold purity. The <br />  monetary <br />    economy was well defined with the Imperial Cholan conquest. In <br />    Tamilnadu, Cholas introduced coinage much prior to Raja raja's <br />    campaign in Sri Lanka. They adopted 'Tiger facing two fishes' <br />as <br />    their emblem on the coinage. Having developed a strong navy, <br />they <br />    traded with Sri Lanka and soon conquered them too. They also <br />set <br />    voyages as far as the islands of Indonesia and Maldives through <br />    ocean. Subsequently they felt the need to mint coins to trade! </p>
<p>    Chola's coinage issues were in all the three metals Gold, Silver <br />  and <br />    Copper. Though the coinage was mainly destined for general <br />    currency, very few commemoratives could be observed. Uttama <br />Chola <br />    struck silver with the royal emblem of "Tiger facing two fishes" <br />  on <br />    the obverse and the Nagari legend "Uttama Chola". Raja Raja <br />  struck <br />    gld fanams bearing the legend Yuddha Malla" on the obverse and <br />the <br />    usual insignia on the reverse. He also struck silver and gold <br />    kahavanus with the standing king on the obverse and the seated <br />  king <br />    on the reverse. Nagari legend "Raja Raja" surrounded him on the <br />    obverse of some types, and the reverse image of some types. </p>
<p>    Rajendra Chola struck coins with the legend "Sri Rajendrah" <br />  beneath <br />    the usual insignia on both reverse and obverse. The copper Kasu <br />  of <br />    Chola started off with the reign of Raja Raja, which passed onto <br />    next generations (even Kulottunga) with the same <br />  standard "Standing <br />    King on the obverse" and "Seated King on the reverse". Sometime <br />    legend "Raja Raja" and sometime the legend "Ku appears on the <br />    coinage surroundig the image. These coins can be seen <br />abundantly <br />  as <br />    the same type of coins with little deformed images were <br />circulated <br />    till the Cholas ceased to exist. </p>

<p>      ANACONDA</p>
<p>      There are two possible origins for the word 'anaconda,' both <br />of <br />    which <br />      are traced to the languages of Sri Lanka: It is perhaps an <br />      alteration of the Sinhalese word 'henakanday', <br />meaning 'thunder <br />      snake', or alternatively, the Tamil word 'anaikondran', which <br />    means <br />      'elephant killer'. <br />      there are no anacondas in sri lanka<br />      It is unclear how the name originated so far from the snake's <br />    native <br />      habitat; it is likely due to its vague similarity to the large <br />    Asian <br />      pythons and portugese conquests in these two corners of the <br />earth</p>
<p>      Local names for the anaconda in South America include the <br />  Spanish <br />      term matatoro, meaning 'bull killer',<br />      venketesh</p>

<p>          one theory for the english word CASH</p>
<p>          The word was formerly used also to refer to certain low-<br />  value <br />        coins <br />          used in South and East Asia. This sense derives from the <br />  Tamil <br />        k&#257;su, <br />          a South Indian monetary unit. The early European <br />    representations <br />        of <br />          this Tamil word, including Portuguese caxa and English <br />cass, <br />        merged <br />          the existing words caixa and cash, which had similar <br />    connections <br />        with <br />          money. In the pre-1818 South Indian monetary system, the <br />  cash <br />    was <br />        the <br />          basic coin, with 80 cash equalling a fanam and 42 fanams <br />      equalling <br />        a <br />          star pagoda worth roughly 7s. 8d.[3]</p>
<p>          This assimilated Tamil word was then applied to various <br />  other <br />        coins <br />          with which European traders came into contact, including <br />the <br />        famous <br />          holed cash coins of China, the Chinese cash. Also called w<br />é®¬ <br />      these <br />          coins were commonly strung on cords for use in larger <br />        transactions; <br />          1000 equalled a tael</p>

<p>            Hi,</p>
<p>            Interested to know the cost of living in chozhar kalam: <br />  from <br />        below <br />            inscription:</p>
<p>            These endowments were made in the following manner. <br />    Kundavaiyar <br />            deposited certain sums of money (kasu), which were <br />    subsequently <br />            borrowed on interest by the inhabitants of certain <br />  villages <br />      from <br />          the <br />            shrine of Chandesvara (paragrah 1), the saint in whose <br />  name <br />    the <br />            money affairs of temples are generally transacted.[3] <br />The <br />        interest <br />            had to be paid yearly into the treasury of the <br />  Rajarajesvara <br />        temple <br />            at Tanjavur either in paddy[4] or in money. In the <br />former <br />    case, <br />        the <br />            interest was three kuruni of paddy for each kasu, and in <br />  the <br />        latter <br />            12Â½ per cent. If it assumed that the rate of interest <br />was <br />    the <br />        same <br />            in both cases, one kasu would correspond to the value of <br />  24 <br />        kuruni <br />            or 2 kalam of paddy . </p>
<p>            one kuruni - is approx 8 kgs of rice. so one kasu got <br />you <br />    192 <br />        kilos <br />            of rice....wow</p>
<p>            In two instances (paragraphs 18 and 21), money was <br />  deposited <br />      for <br />            purchasing a number of sheep, from the milk of which two <br />      private <br />            individuals had to supply daily a certain amount of ghee <br />  for <br />        lamps.<br />            [5] The value of one sheep was reckoned as 1/3 kasu. Or <br />  one <br />        Kasu <br />            got you 3 sheep.</p>
<p>            3 sheep = 192 kilosof rice.</p>
<p>            How does it compare with current day kasu, cost of kilo <br />of <br />    rice <br />        and <br />            one sheep...</p>
<p>            Tamil Inscriptions</p>
<p>            part - i</p>
<p>            INSCRIPTIONS OF THE TANJAVUR TEMPLE</p>
<p>            INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE</p>
<p>            No. 6 On the South Wall second tier</p>
<p>            This and the next inscription, though of different date, <br />  are <br />            engraved continuously in two sections. No. 6 fills the <br />  whole <br />    of <br />        the <br />            first section and part of the first line of the second <br />    section.</p>
<p>            The inscription describes a number of gifts, which were <br />  made <br />        until <br />            the 29th year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, alias <br />            Rajarajadeva, by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar, who was <br />the <br />      elder <br />            sister of Rajarajadeva and the queen of Vallavaraiyar <br />        Vandyadevar. <br />            As, according to the large Leyden grant,[1] Rajaraja was <br />  the <br />      son <br />        of <br />            Parantaka II. It is evident that the name of his sister, <br />        Parantakan <br />            Kundavaiyar, is an abbreviation for Parantakan magal <br />        Kundavaiyar, <br />            i.e., Kundavaiyar, the daughter of Parantaka (II.).</p>
<p>            Paragraph 2 records a gift of gold to the same two <br />    goddesses, <br />        who <br />            are mentioned in the inscription No.2.[2] According to <br />      paragraph <br />        1, <br />            these two images had been set up in the temple of <br />    Rajarajesvara <br />        by <br />            Kundaaiyar herhself. The same princess had set up an <br />image <br />    of <br />        her <br />            mother, to which she presented certain ornaments <br />  (paragraphs <br />    3 <br />        to <br />            5). Other ornaments were given to the image of the god <br />    Dakshina-<br />          Meru-<br />            Vitankar (paragraphs 6 and 7), which had been set up by <br />  king <br />            Rajarajadeva (paragraph 1), and to his consort <br />(paragraphs <br />  8 <br />      and <br />          9), <br />            who was one of the two goddesses referred to in <br />paragraph <br />  2. <br />      The <br />            remainder of the inscription treats of endowments to <br />these <br />    two <br />            goddesses (paragraph 10), to the image of <br />  Ponmaligaittunjina-<br />        devar <br />            (paragraph 14), and to the image of the mother of <br />    Kundavaiyar <br />            (paragraph 19).</p></vj_episteme@></p></abhivencat@></p></vj_episteme@></p></abhivencat@></p></vj_episteme@></p></blockquote>

<p>  Chola's coinage issues were in all the three metals Gold, Silver <br />and <br />  Copper. Though the coinage was mainly destined for general <br />  currency, very few commemoratives could be observed. Uttama Chola <br />  struck silver with the royal emblem of "Tiger facing two fishes" <br />on <br />  the obverse and the Nagari legend "Uttama Chola".

<p>  Rajendra Chola struck coins with the legend "Sri Rajendrah" <br />beneath <br />  the usual insignia on both reverse and obverse. The copper Kasu <br />of <br />  Chola started off with the reign of Raja Raja, which passed onto <br />  next generations (even Kulottunga) with the same <br />standard "Standing <br />  King on the obverse" and "Seated King on the reverse".

<p>    There are two possible origins for the word 'anaconda,' both of <br />  which <br />    are traced to the languages of Sri Lanka: It is perhaps an <br />    alteration of the Sinhalese word 'henakanday', meaning 'thunder <br />    snake', or alternatively, the Tamil word 'anaikondran', which <br />  means <br />    'elephant killer'. <br />    there are no anacondas in sri lanka<br />    It is unclear how the name originated so far from the snake's <br />  native <br />    habitat; it is likely due to its vague similarity to the large <br />  Asian <br />    pythons and portugese conquests in these two corners of the earth</p>

<p>          Hi,</p>
<p>          Interested to know the cost of living in chozhar kalam: <br />from <br />      below <br />          inscription:</p>
<p>          These endowments were made in the following manner. <br />  Kundavaiyar <br />          deposited certain sums of money (kasu), which were <br />  subsequently <br />          borrowed on interest by the inhabitants of certain <br />villages <br />    from <br />        the <br />          shrine of Chandesvara (paragrah 1), the saint in whose <br />name <br />  the <br />          money affairs of temples are generally transacted.[3] The <br />      interest <br />          had to be paid yearly into the treasury of the <br />Rajarajesvara <br />      temple <br />          at Tanjavur either in paddy[4] or in money. In the former <br />  case, <br />      the <br />          interest was three kuruni of paddy for each kasu, and in <br />the <br />      latter <br />          12Â½ per cent. If it assumed that the rate of interest was <br />  the <br />      same <br />          in both cases, one kasu would correspond to the value of <br />24 <br />      kuruni <br />          or 2 kalam of paddy . </p>
<p>          one kuruni - is approx 8 kgs of rice. so one kasu got you <br />  192 <br />      kilos <br />          of rice....wow</p>
<p>          In two instances (paragraphs 18 and 21), money was <br />deposited <br />    for <br />          purchasing a number of sheep, from the milk of which two <br />    private <br />          individuals had to supply daily a certain amount of ghee <br />for <br />      lamps.<br />          [5] The value of one sheep was reckoned as 1/3 kasu. Or <br />one <br />      Kasu <br />          got you 3 sheep.</p>
<p>          3 sheep = 192 kilosof rice.</p>
<p>          How does it compare with current day kasu, cost of kilo of <br />  rice <br />      and <br />          one sheep...</p>
<p>          Tamil Inscriptions</p>
<p>          part - i</p>
<p>          INSCRIPTIONS OF THE TANJAVUR TEMPLE</p>
<p>          INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE</p>
<p>          No. 6 On the South Wall second tier</p>
<p>          This and the next inscription, though of different date, <br />are <br />          engraved continuously in two sections. No. 6 fills the <br />whole <br />  of <br />      the <br />          first section and part of the first line of the second <br />  section.</p>
<p>          The inscription describes a number of gifts, which were <br />made <br />      until <br />          the 29th year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, alias <br />          Rajarajadeva, by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar, who was the <br />    elder <br />          sister of Rajarajadeva and the queen of Vallavaraiyar <br />      Vandyadevar. <br />          As, according to the large Leyden grant,[1] Rajaraja was <br />the <br />    son <br />      of <br />          Parantaka II. It is evident that the name of his sister, <br />      Parantakan <br />          Kundavaiyar, is an abbreviation for Parantakan magal <br />      Kundavaiyar, <br />          i.e., Kundavaiyar, the daughter of Parantaka (II.).</p>
<p>          Paragraph 2 records a gift of gold to the same two <br />  goddesses, <br />      who <br />          are mentioned in the inscription No.2.[2] According to <br />    paragraph <br />      1, <br />          these two images had been set up in the temple of <br />  Rajarajesvara <br />      by <br />          Kundaaiyar herhself. The same princess had set up an image <br />  of <br />      her <br />          mother, to which she presented certain ornaments <br />(paragraphs <br />  3 <br />      to <br />          5). Other ornaments were given to the image of the god <br />  Dakshina-<br />        Meru-<br />          Vitankar (paragraphs 6 and 7), which had been set up by <br />king <br />          Rajarajadeva (paragraph 1), and to his consort (paragraphs <br />8 <br />    and <br />        9), <br />          who was one of the two goddesses referred to in paragraph <br />2. <br />    The <br />          remainder of the inscription treats of endowments to these <br />  two <br />          goddesses (paragraph 10), to the image of <br />Ponmaligaittunjina-<br />      devar <br />          (paragraph 14), and to the image of the mother of <br />  Kundavaiyar <br />          (paragraph 19).</p>

<p>The emblem of a "tiger facing two fish" was adopted by Uttam Chola <br />(973-985) of Thanjavur in ThamilNadu. The seated tiger represented <br />the Chola homeland, and the fish for the Pandya conquest. The fish <br />on the Pandyan coins are horizontal (swimming) and in this case <br />vertical (dead). The title Yuddhamalla was adopted by RajaRaja <br />Chola's son Rajendra Chola (1014-1044). Rajaraja Chola invaded Lanka <br />in 990 AD and conquered the northern half. Ruining Anuradhapura he <br />made Polonnaruwa his capital on the island;. Rajendra Chola <br />succeeded in extended Chola occupation over the whole island of <br />Lanka in 1018. The "seated king" design of Lankan massa became the <br />model for subsequent Chola coins. Lanka became regained independence <br />from Chola occupation in 1070 under Vijaya-bahu (1055-1110). </p>
<p>The design is that of the traditional Lanka type massa.<br />Obverse : Standing king with torch on left and group of spheres on <br />right, surmounted by crescent. Reverse : Seated king on left facing <br />right with legend beneath his raised arm. Sri Raja raja in <br />Devanagari script</p>

<p>          Interested to know the cost of living in chozhar kalam: <br />from <br />      below <br />          inscription:</p>
<p>          These endowments were made in the following manner. <br />  Kundavaiyar <br />          deposited certain sums of money (kasu), which were <br />  subsequently <br />          borrowed on interest by the inhabitants of certain <br />villages <br />    from <br />        the <br />          shrine of Chandesvara (paragrah 1), the saint in whose <br />name <br />  the <br />          money affairs of temples are generally transacted.[3] The <br />      interest <br />          had to be paid yearly into the treasury of the <br />Rajarajesvara <br />      temple <br />          at Tanjavur either in paddy[4] or in money. In the former <br />  case, <br />      the <br />          interest was three kuruni of paddy for each kasu, and in <br />the <br />      latter <br />          12Â½ per cent. If it assumed that the rate of interest was <br />  the <br />      same <br />          in both cases, one kasu would correspond to the value of <br />24 <br />      kuruni <br />          or 2 kalam of paddy . </p>
<p>          one kuruni - is approx 8 kgs of rice. so one kasu got you <br />  192 <br />      kilos <br />          of rice....wow</p>
<p>          In two instances (paragraphs 18 and 21), money was <br />deposited <br />    for <br />          purchasing a number of sheep, from the milk of which two <br />    private <br />          individuals had to supply daily a certain amount of ghee <br />for <br />      lamps.<br />          [5] The value of one sheep was reckoned as 1/3 kasu. Or <br />one <br />      Kasu <br />          got you 3 sheep.</p>
<p>          3 sheep = 192 kilosof rice.</p>
<p>          How does it compare with current day kasu, cost of kilo of <br />  rice <br />      and <br />          one sheep...</p>
<p>          Tamil Inscriptions</p>
<p>          part - i</p>
<p>          INSCRIPTIONS OF THE TANJAVUR TEMPLE</p>
<p>          INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE</p>
<p>          No. 6 On the South Wall second tier</p>
<p>          This and the next inscription, though of different date, <br />are <br />          engraved continuously in two sections. No. 6 fills the <br />whole <br />  of <br />      the <br />          first section and part of the first line of the second <br />  section.</p>
<p>          The inscription describes a number of gifts, which were <br />made <br />      until <br />          the 29th year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, alias <br />          Rajarajadeva, by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar, who was the <br />    elder <br />          sister of Rajarajadeva and the queen of Vallavaraiyar <br />      Vandyadevar. <br />          As, according to the large Leyden grant,[1] Rajaraja was <br />the <br />    son <br />      of <br />          Parantaka II. It is evident that the name of his sister, <br />      Parantakan <br />          Kundavaiyar, is an abbreviation for Parantakan magal <br />      Kundavaiyar, <br />          i.e., Kundavaiyar, the daughter of Parantaka (II.).</p>
<p>          Paragraph 2 records a gift of gold to the same two <br />  goddesses, <br />      who <br />          are mentioned in the inscription No.2.[2] According to <br />    paragraph <br />      1, <br />          these two images had been set up in the temple of <br />  Rajarajesvara <br />      by <br />          Kundaaiyar herhself. The same princess had set up an image <br />  of <br />      her <br />          mother, to which she presented certain ornaments <br />(paragraphs <br />  3 <br />      to <br />          5). Other ornaments were given to the image of the god <br />  Dakshina-<br />        Meru-<br />          Vitankar (paragraphs 6 and 7), which had been set up by <br />king <br />          Rajarajadeva (paragraph 1), and to his consort (paragraphs <br />8 <br />    and <br />        9), <br />          who was one of the two goddesses referred to in paragraph <br />2. <br />    The <br />          remainder of the inscription treats of endowments to these <br />  two <br />          goddesses (paragraph 10), to the image of <br />Ponmaligaittunjina-<br />      devar <br />          (paragraph 14), and to the image of the mother of <br />  Kundavaiyar <br />          (paragraph 19).</p>

          How much was one chola kasu        </div>

<p>check this site - its got an excellant collection of chola coins -<br />with good description of what has been embossed....</p>
<p>In the later part of the tenth century, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and Sri <br />Lanka kingdoms adopted coinage once again after a brief break of <br />four centuries. But this time, it triggered off with the gold <br />coinage to initiate major transactions. Soon silver and copper <br />coinage were minted in plenty to meet the day to day needs of <br />commodities. </p>
<p>Raja raja Chola struck coins both in Sri Lanka and India. They <br />differed much in fabric, style and in the gold purity. The monetary <br />economy was well defined with the Imperial Cholan conquest. In <br />Tamilnadu, Cholas introduced coinage much prior to Raja raja's <br />campaign in Sri Lanka. They adopted 'Tiger facing two fishes' as <br />their emblem on the coinage. Having developed a strong navy, they <br />traded with Sri Lanka and soon conquered them too. They also set <br />voyages as far as the islands of Indonesia and Maldives through <br />ocean. Subsequently they felt the need to mint coins to trade! </p>
<p>Chola's coinage issues were in all the three metals Gold, Silver and <br />Copper. Though the coinage was mainly destined for general <br />currency, very few commemoratives could be observed. Uttama Chola <br />struck silver with the royal emblem of "Tiger facing two fishes" on <br />the obverse and the Nagari legend "Uttama Chola". Raja Raja struck <br />gld fanams bearing the legend Yuddha Malla" on the obverse and the <br />usual insignia on the reverse. He also struck silver and gold <br />kahavanus with the standing king on the obverse and the seated king <br />on the reverse. Nagari legend "Raja Raja" surrounded him on the <br />obverse of some types, and the reverse image of some types. </p>
<p>Rajendra Chola struck coins with the legend "Sri Rajendrah" beneath <br />the usual insignia on both reverse and obverse. The copper Kasu of <br />Chola started off with the reign of Raja Raja, which passed onto <br />next generations (even Kulottunga) with the same standard "Standing <br />King on the obverse" and "Seated King on the reverse". Sometime <br />legend "Raja Raja" and sometime the legend "Ku appears on the <br />coinage surroundig the image. These coins can be seen abundantly as <br />the same type of coins with little deformed images were circulated <br />till the Cholas ceased to exist. </p>

<p>      one theory for the english word CASH</p>
<p>      The word was formerly used also to refer to certain low-value <br />    coins <br />      used in South and East Asia. This sense derives from the Tamil <br />    k&#257;su, <br />      a South Indian monetary unit. The early European <br />representations <br />    of <br />      this Tamil word, including Portuguese caxa and English cass, <br />    merged <br />      the existing words caixa and cash, which had similar <br />connections <br />    with <br />      money. In the pre-1818 South Indian monetary system, the cash <br />was <br />    the <br />      basic coin, with 80 cash equalling a fanam and 42 fanams <br />  equalling <br />    a <br />      star pagoda worth roughly 7s. 8d.[3]</p>
<p>      This assimilated Tamil word was then applied to various other <br />    coins <br />      with which European traders came into contact, including the <br />    famous <br />      holed cash coins of China, the Chinese cash. Also called wé®¬ <br />  these <br />      coins were commonly strung on cords for use in larger <br />    transactions; <br />      1000 equalled a tael</p>

<p>      Hi,</p>
<p>      Interested to know the cost of living in chozhar kalam: from <br />  below <br />      inscription:</p>
<p>      These endowments were made in the following manner. Kundavaiyar <br />      deposited certain sums of money (kasu), which were subsequently <br />      borrowed on interest by the inhabitants of certain villages <br />from <br />    the <br />      shrine of Chandesvara (paragrah 1), the saint in whose name the <br />      money affairs of temples are generally transacted.[3] The <br />  interest <br />      had to be paid yearly into the treasury of the Rajarajesvara <br />  temple <br />      at Tanjavur either in paddy[4] or in money. In the former case, <br />  the <br />      interest was three kuruni of paddy for each kasu, and in the <br />  latter <br />      12Â½ per cent. If it assumed that the rate of interest was the <br />  same <br />      in both cases, one kasu would correspond to the value of 24 <br />  kuruni <br />      or 2 kalam of paddy . </p>
<p>      one kuruni - is approx 8 kgs of rice. so one kasu got you 192 <br />  kilos <br />      of rice....wow</p>
<p>      In two instances (paragraphs 18 and 21), money was deposited <br />for <br />      purchasing a number of sheep, from the milk of which two <br />private <br />      individuals had to supply daily a certain amount of ghee for <br />  lamps.<br />      [5] The value of one sheep was reckoned as 1/3 kasu. Or one <br />  Kasu <br />      got you 3 sheep.</p>
<p>      3 sheep = 192 kilosof rice.</p>
<p>      How does it compare with current day kasu, cost of kilo of rice <br />  and <br />      one sheep...</p>

<p>      The inscription describes a number of gifts, which were made <br />  until <br />      the 29th year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, alias <br />      Rajarajadeva, by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar, who was the <br />elder <br />      sister of Rajarajadeva and the queen of Vallavaraiyar <br />  Vandyadevar. <br />      As, according to the large Leyden grant,[1] Rajaraja was the <br />son <br />  of <br />      Parantaka II. It is evident that the name of his sister, <br />  Parantakan <br />      Kundavaiyar, is an abbreviation for Parantakan magal <br />  Kundavaiyar, <br />      i.e., Kundavaiyar, the daughter of Parantaka (II.).</p>
<p>      Paragraph 2 records a gift of gold to the same two goddesses, <br />  who <br />      are mentioned in the inscription No.2.[2] According to <br />paragraph <br />  1, <br />      these two images had been set up in the temple of Rajarajesvara <br />  by <br />      Kundaaiyar herhself. The same princess had set up an image of <br />  her <br />      mother, to which she presented certain ornaments (paragraphs 3 <br />  to <br />      5). Other ornaments were given to the image of the god Dakshina-<br />    Meru-<br />      Vitankar (paragraphs 6 and 7), which had been set up by king <br />      Rajarajadeva (paragraph 1), and to his consort (paragraphs 8 <br />and <br />    9), <br />      who was one of the two goddesses referred to in paragraph 2. <br />The <br />      remainder of the inscription treats of endowments to these two <br />      goddesses (paragraph 10), to the image of Ponmaligaittunjina-<br />  devar <br />      (paragraph 14), and to the image of the mother of Kundavaiyar <br />      (paragraph 19).</p>
