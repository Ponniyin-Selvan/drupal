Media coverage today has an <br />inordinate impact on the views of the populace in <br />general and the administration in particular. 10000 people <br />perishing in a famine in Sub-Saharan <br />Africa might go unnoticed, but the killing of 10 Israelis <br />is given wide coverage enough to impart a <br />180-degree turn to the foreign policy of the world's sole <br />superpower. <br />It is in this recognition of the new global arena that has <br />spurred certain vested interest groups to <br />pump in billions of dollars to PR firms, advertisement <br />agencies and lobbyists in an attempt to <br />garner public support for their actions. In this regard, <br />Indians in general and Hindus in <br />particular have lagged behind considerably. This paper <br />aims and hopes to provide 'motivation, <br />guidance and perhaps the inspiration' to young Indians to <br />take up the cause of the country through <br />the pen and become intellectual warriors or Bauddhika <br />Kshatriya-s. <br />Dr David Frawley had first enunciated the concept <br />of 'Bauddhika Kshatriya' in a classic article in <br />the context of Hindu religion [1]. The present paper <br />extends the idea to the convergent realm of <br />Indian nationalism, Indian religion and Indian culture. <br />Introduction: <br />The modern era is, not without reason, called the <br />Information Age [2]. The layman is inundated by <br />reams of information. Perception rules over reality and <br />packaging of the information often scores <br />over contents. The ability of the educational system and <br />media to mould public opinion is well <br />recognized by the various pressure groups in the world. <br />Both M K Gandhi [3] and M A Jinnah [4] <br />utilized the power of the media to their maximum <br />advantage. The media's power is further reinforced <br />in 'trust and value driven' Oriental societies where the <br />media word is often accepted as the <br />Biblical truth. <br />In neighboring Pakistan, the history books were tampered <br />with (beginning in the Zia regime) to <br />inculcate a feeling of hatred and animosity towards the <br />Hindus [5]. The ideology of Pakistan was <br />projected as an Islamic one and all history preceding the <br />advent of Islam was erased [6]. In India, <br />the Marxist historians planted false theories like the <br />Aryan Invasion Myth [7] to divide the people <br />on a regional and caste basis. The Mughal era atrocities <br />were whitewashed [8] and every indigenous <br />effort was denigrated. Our history books of the last 50 <br />years were modified to inculcate a sense of <br />self-deprecation amongst the Indian youth. <br />In the present context, the Hindu nationalists are <br />attempting to rewrite history with two foremost <br />objectives: [9] <br />a. Indians are made aware of their glorious past and <br />made to feel proud of their splendid <br />heritage. The confident Indian youth are then <br />enthused and exhorted to take India to the <br />pinnacle of glory that once belonged to it. <br />b. The mistakes committed by the Indians in the past <br />are highlighted. An objective post-mortem <br />examination of the same preempts committing the same <br />mistake again in the future. <br />As David Frawley [1] points out, other cultures and <br />traditions have realized the power of the media <br />to influence public opinion. Islamic lobbies invest <br />billions in United States to obscure the <br />realities of their faith as exposed by their more radical <br />co-religionists [10]. Another aspect of <br />the combat in this new arena is its degeneration into a <br />vicious disinformation program against <br />adversaries or groups with conflicting ideologies. 'In <br />this contest whoever puts out information <br />first usually gains credibility by defining the field. <br />Whoever puts out information in the most <br />sophisticated and high tech <br />manner has the best audience in the long run and generally <br />the best success in promoting their <br />agenda.' [1] <br />Even Pakistan and China have implemented several steps in <br />this direction to project their influence <br />and indulge in a blatant disinformation campaign against <br />the Indians. Pakistanis control every <br />South Asian think-tank in the United States [11]. The <br />very idea of a South Asian entity is <br />abhorrent to the author [12]. All the positive points <br />about India get transferred to this South <br />Asian bloc and in return we are saddled with the negative <br />connotations arising from the nefarious <br />activities of the Pakistanis and the Bangladeshis. While <br />China projects the notion of Greater China <br />[13] vigorously, the notion of Greater India [14] is <br />vituperatively dismissed. The Indian elephant <br />becomes the Asiatic elephant [15]. The Pakistani pseudo-<br />scholars already address the Indian Ocean <br />as the South Asian Ocean [16]. Articles on yoga [17] and <br />meditation [18] in the US mainstream media <br />no more mention India. The success of the Pakistani <br />endeavor is seen in the fact that the US <br />administration still treats India and Pakistan on an equal <br />footing. [19] <br />Within India, the Resident Non-Indians [20] have done <br />everything in their power to hamper national <br />integration and destruct the unity and integrity of our <br />country. Every group with the initials <br />mentioning the words peace, justice and secularism [21] is <br />controlled by the Marxists who have left <br />no stone unturned to denigrate India and its people. The <br />Marxists have displayed expert <br />coordination in their activities complementing each other <br />in every sense of the word. Lubricated <br />and propelled ahead by mammon and fame, they collude in <br />their diabolical schemes to push India to <br />permanent ignominy and penury [22]. <br />The Marxists' subversion of our history books [23] and the <br />resulting damage to India's psyche is <br />well documented. They control the English language press <br />[24] and use it repeatedly to attack the <br />Indian interests. The Goebbelsian Marxists through <br />specious reasons projected the incontrovertible <br />evidence of the Ayodhya temple as nebulous [25]. The <br />Marxist intellectuals through another display <br />of wizardly casuistry depicted the Narendra Modi <br />government as anti-Muslim ignoring the fact his <br />administration arrested (including preventive) more than <br />27900 Hindus as compared to less than 7700 <br />Muslims [26]. <br />It is the success of the untiring efforts of the Resident <br />Non-Indians that the West views us through <br />the stereotypes of 'caste, dowry deaths, widow burning, <br />strange cults, poverty and superstition'. <br />[27] <br />Indian gods are insulted as phallic cults, Indian beliefs <br />are dismissed as animist, Indian culture <br />is denigrated as primitive, Indian values are condemned as <br />anachronistic, Indian heritage is ignored <br />as worthless, Indian people are looked down upon as <br />penurious. If ever there was a need for an <br />intellectual warrior to guard India's consciousness, pride <br />and national interests, it is now, it is <br />now and it is now. <br />Who is a Bauddhika Kshatriya? <br />The venerable patriot-saint Sri Aurobindo defines a <br />Bauddhika Kshatriya as follows: ""[Such a <br />person] should be absolutely unsparing in our attack on <br />whatever obstructs the growth of the nation, <br />and never be afraid to call a spade a spade. Excessive <br />good nature will never do ... in serious <br />politics. <br />Respect of persons must always give way to truth and <br />conscience... What India needs especially at <br />this moment is aggressive virtues, the spirit of soaring <br />idealism, bold creation, fearless <br />resistance, courageous attack; of the passive tamasic <br />inertia we already have too much." [28] <br />Every culture, every religion and every nation has its <br />intellectual warriors, who articulate its <br />cherished values, present a favorable view of it, <br />challenge negative outlooks, define its present <br />and lay out a grand framework for its glorious future. A <br />Bauddhika Kshatriya would dispassionately <br />yet aggressively defend the Indian civilizational ethos <br />without the fear of being named a <br />communalist or a fundamentalist. A Bauddhika Kshatriya <br />would rise like a sun dispelling the false <br />notions circulating about India and defend her <br />incomparable pluralistic traditions from the <br />onslaught of exclusivist creeds in the economic, political <br />and religious realm. [29] <br />India's unique heritage <br />To define the code of conduct of such a Bauddhika <br />Kshatriya, it is essential to understand the <br />unique nature of India's heritage. A French Catholic has <br />three aspects to his identity: his <br />nationality comes from France, his religion comes from <br />Italy and his culture comes from Greece. For <br />an Indian religionist in India, the nationality comes from <br />India, the religion also comes from India <br />and the culture also comes from India. It is this <br />understanding of the convergent nature of Indian <br />Nationalism, Indian Religion and Indian Culture that a <br />Bauddhika Kshatriya would seek to promote. <br />Today this unique tradition bequeathed to us by our <br />illustrious forefathers is under threat on all <br />the three fronts. Indian nationalism is denunciated and <br />labeled jingoism. Even today Ambedkarites <br />point to the fact that Ambedkar opposed the freedom <br />struggle and proudly acclaim their great leader <br />of being a 'true internationalist' instead of being a <br />narrow minded nationalist like Sardar <br />Vallabhai Patel [30]. NGOs assisting poor tribals in India <br />are attacked and accused of funding hate <br />campaigns [31]. Attempts are made to ruin the cracker <br />industry by accusing it of child labor even <br />if it had been removed from the scene [32]. Certain <br />Marxist intellectuals even exhorted <br />industrialists to restrain themselves from investing in <br />Gujarat [33]. Recently a 'secular Indian' <br />English daily gleefully reported that Indians would not <br />support their country blindly [34]. Another <br />'secular Indian' daily labeled Vajpayee's pledge to <br />recover PoK as populist and criticized 'wanton <br />exoneration of the army' [35]. Editors of 2 'secular <br />Indian' English newspapers held a press <br />conference in Islamabad and demonized the Delhi government <br />as bellicose. [36] A 'secular Indian' <br />author recently opposed the Indian claim to obtain a <br />permanent seat at the United Nations [37]. <br />Another 'secular Indian' author accused Vajpayee of <br />displaying 'typical Brahminical deviousness' <br />[38]. <br />Indian religion is also under severe attack. Demographic <br />studies have underlined the rapid decline <br />in the number of Indian Religionists. [39] The percentage <br />of the Indian Religionists in the <br />subcontinent has decreased from about 89% in the 1870s to <br />less than 69% currently. [40] India now <br />has the world's largest number of Christian missionaries <br />[41] who haven't hesitated to employ any <br />overt or covert means in their efforts to convert this <br />land into a Christian colony [42]. To add to <br />the misery of the Indians, the government legally takes <br />away the temple revenues and redistributes <br />the money amongst the churches and the madrassas [43]. <br />This has led to the complete collapse of <br />several temples and the resultant spiritual vacuum is <br />being exploited by vested interests [44]. <br />600,000 Hindus were thrown out from Kashmir, which is the <br />land of Kashyapa, and still no one <br />complains of genocide or a pogrom [45]. In contrast the <br />death of 700 Muslims in a state having 5 <br />million Muslims was highlighted for days in the 'secular <br />Indian' media [46]. The government has <br />failed to realize the importance of the unique socio-<br />religio-political glue that Hinduism employs to <br />hold India together as a single nation. <br />Indian culture is lampooned by the 'secular Indian' media. <br />Our national song is declared 'communal' <br />and rejected [47]. Our invocation for education like the <br />Saraswati Vandana is mocked at [48]. Our <br />goddesses, whom we revere, are depicted in the nude to <br />insult our sensibilities [49]. Indologists <br />publish books with offensive language on our gods [50]. <br />Our indigenous customs are satirized and the <br />people are reprimanded for continuing them. The United <br />Nations recently pointed out that the <br />tradition of Vedic chanting is on its way to extinction in <br />this country within the coming 30 years <br />[51]. Our youngsters are taught the Bible before they even <br />hear of the Gita and the Upanishads [52]. <br />Indigenous art, sculpture, music, literature and dance are <br />all on their way to extermination within <br />the next 25 years [53]. <br />Code of Conduct of a Bauddhika Kshatriya <br />A Bauddhika Kshatriya would base his/her conduct on the <br />great Intellectual Warriors of the past like <br />Adi Sankara [54], Guru Gobind Singh [55], Swami <br />Vivekananda [56] and Sri Aurobindo [57]. A Bauddhika <br />Kshatriya would assemble a team of dedicated workers to <br />uphold the convergent triumvirate of Indian <br />nationalism, Indian religion and Indian culture against <br />this information and media onslaught. 'Such <br />individuals must be above commercial manipulation and self-<br />promotion, working tirelessly to counter <br />this disinformation flood.' [1] <br />A Bauddhika Kshatriya shall be adept in the ancient Indian <br />technique of tarka or intellectual debate <br />[58]. The individual must be a perfect combination of <br />Brahma (spiritual power) and Kshatra <br />(political power). The Bauddhika Kshatriya would project <br />an articulate and compelling intellectual <br />view that would bring back the alienated western educated <br />Indian elite to its eternal roots. As <br />Frawley suggests, "A true Kshatriya is devoted to Dharma <br />and cannot be won over by name, fame, <br />influence or money. He is not seeking office, to create a <br />vote bank, or to gain followers, but to <br />uphold Dharma without compromise or inflexibility." [1] <br />Swami Vivekananda had recognized the idealism in the youth <br />and channelised that towards the <br />advancement of our nation. [59] Swami Vivekananda in the <br />east, Savarkar [60] and Tilak [61] in the <br />west and Sri Aurobindo [62] all combined religion with <br />patriotism in gallant attempts to turn <br />Sanatana Dharma into a world cultural force through which <br />a notion of Greater India could be <br />projected. The modern Bauddhika Kshatriya would embed the <br />solutions of modern contemporary issues <br />in a traditional mould and propel the inhabitants of this <br />great nation toward materialistic progress <br />coupled with spiritual fulfillment. The Bauddhika <br />Kshatriya would think, act and influence others. <br />The Bauddhika Kshatriya shall not escape the realities of <br />modern mundane life. He/she would <br />transcend it with clear visionary thinking. The Bauddhika <br />Kshatriya would be dispassionate, calm and <br />still argue with the precision of a missile. The Bauddhika <br />Kshatriya would not fear or complain <br />about adverse circumstances; he/she would take the fight <br />to the enemy camp, set the agenda and be <br />proactive in all circumstances. The Bauddhika Kshatriya <br />shall be revolutionary in outlook and would <br />correct historical wrongs committed by the people. <br />As Frawley states, "The new intellectual Kshatriya must <br />throw up an ethical challenge, which is the <br />challenge of Dharma, exposing the danger of exclusivist <br />religious cults, materialistic political <br />philosophies, and unchecked commercialism. The West throws <br />its ethical challenge to the world, <br />criticizing other countries, including India, for lack of <br />human rights. This requires a Hindu <br />response, which is to expose the West's promotion of arms <br />sales, environmental depredation, and <br />projection of sensate materialism all over the world." [1] <br />The Bauddhika Kshatriya would establish <br />an alternate to the current western models of science, <br />religion and politics. <br />The Bauddhika Kshatriya would objectively analyze and <br />explain unanswered questions like why <br />Hindu-majority areas like Lahore, Sylhet and Chittagong <br />were given away to Pakistan by Nehru [63]. <br />The Bauddhika Kshatriya would be the messiah of Indians <br />everywhere on Earth [64]. The Bauddhika <br />Kshatriya would assist the Indians in Fiji [65], aid the <br />Indians in Malaysia [66], enthuse the <br />Indians in Africa [67] and inspire the Indians in the <br />Americas [68]. The Bauddhika Kshatriya would <br />emancipate the hungry millions of the land, yet making the <br />ideal tradeoff in the guns versus butter <br />choice. The Bauddhika Kshatriya would establish Ram Rajya <br />in this country and demolish the ant-Hindu <br />communist conspirators mouthing socialist shibboleths in <br />the universities [69]. <br />Challenges before the Bauddhika Kshatriya <br />A Bauddhika Kshatriya would combat the following sections <br />of the Indian nation.[70] <br />1. Mullah: This refers to the Sunni Muslim [71] <br />elite, which insists on a separate identity <br />than their Indian one. The present government spends <br />more than 190 crores on the Haj travel in <br />an action devoid of any economic benefit [72]. The <br />imam of a certain mosque refused to pray <br />for the soldiers at Kargil as they were combating a <br />Muslim Pakistan [73]. The Moplah rebellion <br />[74] and activities of SIMI [75] also fall in to <br />this category. <br />2. Missionary: This refers to the Christian <br />missionaries who openly attack Hinduism [76]. In <br />spite of Gandhiji openly criticizing conversion <br />[77], the activities of the missionaries have <br />continued unabated [78]. Using deception [79], <br />violence [80], disguise under cloak of school <br />[81] and hospital [82] the missionaries have <br />contributed directly to the present chaos in the <br />Northeast [83] and the tribal hinterlands of MP and <br />Orissa [84]. <br />3. Minorityist: This refers to the so called <br />secularists dominating our landscape today <br />[85]. The National Human Rights Commission displayed <br />this by raking up the Best Bakery Case <br />while turning a Nelson's eye to the Jogeshwari case <br />where the accused Muslims were acquitted <br />for want of evidence [86]. The Election Commission <br />of India displayed this by postponing <br />elections in Gujarat, while holding it in the much <br />more disturbed Jammu and Kashmir [87]. <br />4. Marxist: This refers to the extreme Chinese <br />nationalists [88] born as Indians merely by <br />'accident of birth' [89]. They successfully <br />transformed Calcutta from a gem to a dowager of a <br />city within 25 years of misrule [90]. They further <br />have left no stone unturned in any <br />anti-national activity in the country [91]. <br />5. Mandalist: This category brought the Indian <br />public sector to its ultimate downfall by <br />implementing time bound promotions for certain <br />Superior Castes/ Scientific Tribes also known <br />as SC/STs [92]. They destroyed meritocracy and <br />established anti-Brahminism as the fundamental <br />philosophy of political life [93]. <br />6. Mayoist: This refers to the progeny of <br />Catherine Mayo [94], whom Gandhi described as 'a <br />drain inspector' [95]. This category believes that <br />everything good in India came from outside <br />and everything bad is purely indigenous. They <br />constitute most of our Page 3 socialites. <br />7. Maoist: This refers to the Naxalites [96] and <br />their fellow journeymen who believe in a <br />nation-less world. Their imprudent action has only <br />served to accentuate poverty in regions <br />they afflict [97]. <br />8. Macaulayite: This refers to the Convent-<br />educated elite marinated for years in Nehruvian <br />socialism. They have inculcated several <br />characteristics from the above listed categories. <br />Their legendary activities make them more Christian <br />than the Christians themselves [98]. <br />9. Me, Mine, Myself: This category has never <br />bothered itself with any development till they <br />are directly impacted by it. But often it is too <br />late for them to react when it actually comes <br />to them [99]. <br />10. Media: This M-factor is controlled by the above <br />9 Ms. This so called secular device has <br />done untold damage to the Indian nationalistic <br />feelings, religious traditions and cultural <br />values [100]. <br />Conclusion <br />The modern era is characterized by several radical <br />developments like the deluge of information for <br />which there appears to be no precedent in history. This <br />provides both an opportunity [101] and a <br />risk factor to the emergence of India as a great global <br />power [102]. The enemies of the nation have <br />mounted an unprecedented attack on it. Any attempt to <br />benefit India in the remotest way is <br />criticized openly [103] or 'stifled with silence' [104]. <br />As the soul of India wrenches in misery at <br />the myriad knots the so called secularists weave, the <br />weave nation as a whole awaits the emergence <br />of a new Swami Vivekananda to lead it through these <br />turbulent times. The hour of reckoning of the <br />youth of the country has come. Are the youth of India <br />ready for this challenge? The Mother is <br />waiting? <br />The US Supreme Court in a landmark judgement pronounced <br />that while the American state is secular, <br />the American country is Christian [105]. <br />Is there one person in this vast nation of one billion <br />where more than half of the population is <br />below the age of 25 who could make a similar statement <br />that while the Indian state is secular, the <br />Indian nation is Hindu? <br />Is there one person in this vast nation of one billion <br />where more than half of the population is <br />below the age of 25 who can stand up and repeat the <br />following verse by Guru Gobind Singh with <br />pride? <br />"Vedahun vidit dharma pracharyun, Gohat kalamka vishva <br />nivaryun. <br />Sakal jagat mein Khalsa Panth gaajey, Jagey dharm Hindu <br />sakal bhand Bhajey" <br />(May I preach the Vedas to the whole mankind / May I <br />remove the blot of cow-slaughter from the whole <br />world / May the Khalsa Panth reign supreme / Long live <br />Hinduism and falsehood perish) [106] <br />Is there one person in this vast nation of one billion <br />where more than half of the population is <br />below the age of 25 who could put the interests of the <br />nation above all provincial, parochial and <br />regional interests? <br />Is there one person in this vast nation of one billion <br />where more than half of the population is <br />below the age of 25 who could challenge the distortions <br />about India in the media, in the schools, in <br />the books and over the Internet? <br />Is there one person in this vast nation of one billion <br />where more than half of the population is <br />below the age of 25 who could successfully lead India to a <br />world superpower status by 2050? <br />Are the youth of India ready for the challenge? The Mother <br />is waiting? <br />Notes: <br />1.

Mohammed Ali Jinnah founded the Dawn <br />newspaper (<a href="http://www.dawn.com" title="www.dawn.com">www.dawn.com</a>) and used it effectively <br />to convince the Muslim elite throughout the country <br />to vote for a separate Muslim entity. <br />Later more than half of those who voted for Pakistan <br />were asked to stay back in India. <br />5. This fact is well documented in the report <br />titled 'The Subtle Subversion: A report on <br />Curricula and Textbooks in Pakistan' prepared by A H <br />Nayyar and Ahmed Salim.

The centers of South Asian studies in every <br />major university in US are filled with <br />India-baiters who are either Pakistani or Marxist. <br />These groups regularly hold meetings on <br />Kashmir where they gleefully and unanimously berate <br />India on various counts of human rights <br />violations. <br />12. Rajiv Malhotra addresses this issue in this <br />Rediff article at <br /><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/dec/08rajiv.htm" title="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/dec/08rajiv.htm">http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/dec/08rajiv.htm</a> <br />titled 'Does South Asian Studies Undermine <br />India?' <br />13.

In contrast, no attempt is made by the media <br />to show the great cultural impact of India <br />on neighboring nations like Myanmar, Cambodia and <br />Indonesia. E.g. Indonesia still retains <br />Sanskrit names, Cambodia has the world's largest <br />Hindu temple. <br />15. In this article, the author mentions Indian <br />only in the first name and then goes on <br />using a defunct term like 'Asiatic Elephant'. <br /><a href="http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/" title="http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/">http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/</a> <br />walkers_mammals_of_the_world/proboscidea/ <br />proboscidea.elephantidae.elephas.html <br />16. Rajeev Srinivasan mentions this fact in his <br />Rediff article at <br /><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/mar/19rajeev.htm" title="http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/mar/19rajeev.htm">http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/mar/19rajeev.htm</a> <br />titled 'Why I am not a South Asian?' <br />17. According to one survey 98% of the yoga <br />instructors are Americans. The Indians somehow <br />have not got associated with this activity at all. <br />18. Certain individuals have projected their own <br />variety of Meditation techniques as <br />distinct from Sanatana Dharma or the Hindu way of <br />living. <br />19. The fact that Musharraf holds many more press <br />meetings has been described earlier also. <br />Kaushik Kapisthalam in an article titled 'Analysing <br />South Asian Analysts' describes how US <br />analysts often end up equating India and Pakistan. <br /><a href="http://www.orfonline.org/analysis/A044.htm" title="http://www.orfonline.org/analysis/A044.htm">http://www.orfonline.org/analysis/A044.htm</a> <br />20. The term Resident Non-Indian (RNI) appears to <br />have been coined by Rajeev Srinivasan in <br />his Rediff article titled 'Patriot Games and <br />Resident Non-Indians' at <br /><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/may/22rajeev.htm" title="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/may/22rajeev.htm">http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/may/22rajeev.htm</a> <br />21. A simple google search for the phrase 'Centers <br />for Peace, Justice and Secularism' would <br />validate this fact. This is an alarming trend that <br />must be tackled by the nationalists. The <br />anti-Indian forces cannot be allowed to permanently <br />hijack those words. <br />22. It is an ironical fact the very fellows <br />claiming to be fighting poverty manage to <br />increase it. A certain pseudo-secular party in India <br />continues to get votes in the name of <br />'Garibi hatao' while doing its best in retaining it <br />in the country. <br />23. The Marxist historians (thoroughly exposed in <br />Arun Shourie's Eminent Historians) <br />perpetuated several myths that have now been <br />exposed. At <a href="http://www.geocities.com/" title="http://www.geocities.com/">http://www.geocities.com/</a> <br />ifihhome/articles/bbl002.html BB Lal writes on 'Why <br />Perpetuate Myths?'

The absolute control of the English media by a <br />small section of anti-nationals would <br />probably be the subject of a research study in the <br />future. The disease, thankfully, has not <br />spread to the vernacular media that still retains <br />its objectivity in contents and reporting. <br />25. It is a wonder that in spite of monumental <br />evidence supporting the Hindus, the <br />pseudo-secularists managed to keep the issue <br />burning. Posterity would definitely record the <br />Ayodhya dispute as the greatest example of the <br />success of the Mephistophelean Goebbels <br />technique. For an introduction to the issue, look at <br /><a href="http://ayodhya2000.tripod.com./" title="http://ayodhya2000.tripod.com./">http://ayodhya2000.tripod.com./</a> <br />26. Prof Ramesh Rao provided an interesting <br />analysis of the Gujarat situation in a report <br />titled 'Genocide in Gujarat or Massacring of truth' <br />in an email circulated in the RRCC Experts <br />Forum e-group. <br />27. This penurious image of India also enabled <br />fraudulent organizations like the <br />Missionaries of Charity to gather money for <br />conversion activities. Several independent <br />scholars like Christopher Hitchens, Aroup <br />Chatterjee, and MS Srinivasan have now exposed the <br />mask of Mother Teresa. <br />28.

This is a double-crossed game the Marxists <br />play. On one hand, they exhort the <br />industrialists to restraint themselves from <br />investing in Gujarat and on the other hand, they <br />write articles in the media attributing the lack of <br />investment in Gujarat to the Hindutva <br />government there. Unfortunately for the Marxists and <br />fortunately for India, the investments <br />simply boomed under the administration of Narendra <br />Modi. <br />34. Times of India archives, December 2003 <br />35. In India, the RSS is perceived to pro-army as <br />it has consistently drawn attention to the <br />harsh conditions under they operate as opposed to <br />the communists who seek persecution of our <br />jawans for killing Pakistani terrorists. <br />36. 'Mr. Ram, who endorsed the views of Mr. Aziz, <br />said that the post-1998 tensions in the <br />sub-continent could be directly linked to the <br />ascendance of the Hindutva right-wingers in <br />India and nuclearisation of both the countries'? <br />This line is from the pages of 'The Hindu' <br />itself that has of late established a name for <br />itself as the most anti-Hindu newspaper on the <br />planet.

It is <br />titled 'Permanent Membership not for India'. The <br />article demonstrates the extents to which these <br />fellows can go to hinder India's interests. <br />38. In a shocking display of decline in <br />journalistic standards, Deccan Chronicle columnist <br />Seema Mustafa writes thus at <br /><a href="http://www.deccan.com/columnists/" title="http://www.deccan.com/columnists/">http://www.deccan.com/columnists/</a> <br />seema.shtml - PM vs Sonia'He consults all for a <br />feedback, makes up his own mind, and then acts <br />with the Brahminical deviousness for which he is <br />renowned.' This fact came to my notice <br />through an email by Dr Arindam Banerji at the RRCC <br />Experts Forum e-group. <br />39.

S Gurumurthy explores this issue further in <br />his article in the Organiser dated Oct 24, <br />1998 titled 'Vande Mataram then, Saraswati Vandana <br />now' <br />49. MF Hussain's depiction of Goddess Saraswati <br />and Sita in the nude provoked hurt Shiv Sena <br />members to attack the painting in Mumbai a few years <br />back. This prompted a backlash from the <br />pseudo-secular class which took great pains to <br />explain why drawing Hindu goddesses in the nude <br />was liberal, but doing the same for Christians or <br />Muslims was communal. <br />50.
