</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear all...</p>
<p>Day 2 (Saturday, February 8th):</p>
<p>Day 2 started in a more leisurely way than Day 1- we started at 7.30,<br />finished breakfast, and set off on our way to the Periya Koil, the first on<br />our agenda.</p>
<p>The Periya Koil, as many people have talked about in many different ways, is<br />a masterpiece. Built by the hero of our story, its size, structure, its<br />dazzling dimensions have earned it a place in World Heritage. What more can<br />one say?</p>
<p>In side the temple complex, we split up. Half of us went wandering around<br />the enormous corridors that surround the temple, some of us ambled over to<br />the Nandi. Mr.Vishwaksenan disappeared to hunt out the Kalki agent for that <br />area, and they appeared in a few minutes, right in the middle of a <br />discussion about the temple.</p>
<p>Mr. Balakumaran had said in his tape that the so-called 'single stone' at<br />the head of the vimanam wasn't a single stone at all, but was made of many<br />stones set very close together ("...aaranju chulai maathiri...")- and with<br />luck, the temple authorities agreed to open up the first level of the<br />temple- a part which is generally closed to the public, and which requires<br />special admission if one has to see it. All of us trooped up the stone steps <br />up to the first level. They led upto a terrace, with the gopuram rising to <br />our left. The Kalki agent led us to the doorway and unlocked it.</p>
<p>We stepped inside a dark corridor, which ran to our left and right, and <br />vanished into darkness. Another set of steps led to a doorway which looked <br />onto a chamber over the garba griham. It was barred at one end (because we <br />mustn&#146;t stand right on top of the garba griham)- and then the spotlights <br />were switched on. We raised our heads and looked straight up to the top of <br />the gopuram. The hollow structure spiralled into the darkness right up to <br />the very top. It was a magnificent architectural feat. How they ever managed <br />to do this so many thousands of years ago is simply amazing...</p>
<p>Outside, the dark corridor was lit up, and we could see sculptures detailing <br />the various dance poses of Lord Nataraja. The panel above the sculptures was <br />filled with vague colours and outlines. These, we learnt, were paintings <br />showing King Raja raja and his consorts, and other scenes. Almost nothing <br />remained of them. The dance poses, on the other hand, were minute- each one <br />of them was exquisitely detailed. (Dancer Padma Subramanian once visited <br />this place, it seems, and did some serious research for a whole fortnight).</p>
<p>Some of the dance poses weren't completed- blocks of stone, chiselled and <br />ready for sculpting, had been left empty- they seemed to waiting for the <br />hands of a great sculptor to touch them, who would shake them out of their <br />sleep and convert them into gleaming figurines...</p>
<p>This chamber containing the dance panels, with its dark corridor running <br />'inside' the gopuram is quite an architectural feat in itself. Its walls, <br />rising upwards, broaden gradually to meet the outer gopuram at the top. <br />Magnificent.</p>
<p>After another bout of photographs, we descended to the ground (literally and <br />imaginatively:-), and began a walking tour of the corridors that surround <br />the temple. The paintings on the walls had been disfigured (by 'English' <br />kalvettus, as someone quipped)- but for all that, their beauty was not <br />impaired. One could only marvel at the vision of Raja raja- not just his <br />ambition to produce one of the greatest temples in South India, but his <br />magnanimity in acknowledging the fact that other people (his wives, and <br />those who had contributed wealth and effort in building the temple) had put <br />in valuable effort in completing the temple.</p>
<p>"...Shri Raajaraajeeswara mudaiyaarkku naan kuduthanavum akkan kudduthanavum <br />nam pendugal kuduthanavum matrum kuduthaar kuduthanavum..."</p>
<p>After all, he could just have said that he built the temple, and left it at <br />that. Who would have dared to oppose him?</p>
<p>(Seems he was taking a bath in the Chozha Maligai in Thanjai, when he <br />ordered etching inscriptions into stone:-)</p>
<p>After visiting the other sannithis and lounging about the lawns for a while, <br />we left the temple reluctantly. It was 11 AM when we started towards <br />Saraswathi Mahal (Periya Koil had made us stay an hour more than we <br />intended:-). Since we wanted to make good time to Kodikarai, we stayed in <br />Saraswathi Mahal just long enough to take a sweeping look at it- not more <br />than half an hour. (what we looked through included the Maratha dresses, <br />weapons, kitchen utensils and other odds and ends. I especially liked the <br />'thengai thuruvi':-)</p>
<p>One of the guardian angels of Thanjavur, the 'Nisumba Sudhani' (described by <br />Balakumaran in his tape as quite a hideous entity) was on our agenda- the <br />temple still exists, but is known as the 'Vada Badhra kaali (info- Mr. <br />Sunder Bharadwaj) temple. Since it was nearing twelve, we decided to skip <br />it. Lunch was finished quickly in Thanjai, and we set off at 1.30 PM - to <br />Point Calimere.</p>
<p>We reached Kodaikarai by 5 PM ( around 100 Kms). The roads were not too bad, <br />we made good time, really (Passing the 'Raamar Paadham' on the way, and <br />uppalams, signaling the approach of the sea). Our first stop, naturally, was <br />the Kuzhagar Koil. A big, graceful structure with graying walls loomed up in <br />front of us with a high mathil suvar. Kodikarai proper was 4 kms from the <br />Koil. (Apparently, Poonghuzhali jumped down from the mathil and sprinted all <br />the 4kms to the beach. Quite in keeping with her character!)</p>
<p>We took a tour of the temple, which stood majestically, with a few huts at <br />the side. Thankfully, this was not quite so dilapidated as some <br />others(probably due to the thiruppani that seems to have been done- in <br />1940s). There were some obvious additions- the brick-paved floor, for <br />example. The sculptures surrounding the sannithi were in good condition too. <br />And this is where we took the photo of the combination lock (which <br />Krupashankar has posted in his website <br />(<a href="http://www.geocities.com/shankarkrupa/psmy/poottu.jpg" title="http://www.geocities.com/shankarkrupa/psmy/poottu.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/shankarkrupa/psmy/poottu.jpg</a>)- the one where the <br />archagar is holding it like an <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym 47:-). (There is a reference to this lock <br />in this week's Kalki issue too- dated 16.02.2003 under the section 'Remote'. <br />Apparently, it was mentioned in the 'Kalach chuvadu' section in Jaya TV.)</acronym></p>
<p>Kamal decided to show off his driving abilities by rushing the van at us:-)- <br />and we took some photos here too. The approach road to the temple is <br />well-paved and the whole area is neat and tidy (in spite of scrubby bushes <br />abounding all over the place)-obviously, it has been re-furbished since <br />Kalki's times. Kuzhagar is no longer all that alone.</p>
<p>At 5.30 PM, we started towards the beach- and it proved to be the best <br />evening in the trip:-)</p>
<p>We stopped at the forest department's place first- we needed special <br />permission to get to the beach. After suitably arranging matters, we took <br />off. (The beach brought on talk about the trip to Sri Lanka). The road ran <br />through the village and entered scrubland. After a while we came to a gate, <br />after passing which, we entered the real Kodikarai- described by Kalki. <br />Thorny shrubs grew in clumps all over the vast, flatland, stretching away <br />into the horizon. Deer, grazing patiently, threw startled glances at our <br />approach, and gambolled into the shrubbery (just as Poonghuzhali saw them). <br />Some of them suddenly jumped high in the air- we wondered if there were any <br />'puthai kuzhis' there. The gound seemed firm in most places, and slightly <br />muddled in others.</p>
<p>The mud road meandered through more shrubs, some growing so thickly that <br />there were a few possible sites for the 'maraindha mandapam' :-), twisting <br />and turning. A few cows strayed about lazily. Finally, a few minutes later, <br />the sea appeared- little waves flowing gently to the shore, and the blue <br />waters fading into the horizon- exactly as in 'Ponniyin Selvan'.</p>
<p>One could easily picture Vandhiyathevan trying to wash himself in the sea, <br />desperate to get himself clean:-). There was a lonely brick structure right <br />on the beach- the remains of some long gone lighthouse of some bygone era, <br />perhaps. There was a curious hole in it- probably a window embrasure, and we <br />all took turns, sticking our heads through it.:-)</p>
<p>The setting sun threw its slanting rays through the 'window', and the sea <br />shore was converted into an idyllic spot, stretching away on all sides. It <br />was completely empty-except for us. Our first instinct was to get into the <br />sea, which we did. Krupashankar and Kamal emulated a Veera Saivan and <br />Vaishnavan-both had their hands on the other's neck- and the former promptly <br />sat down in the water (which was splendidly cool after the hot drive).</p>
<p>We spent an hour there. splashing through the water to our heart's content. <br />Almost everyone, I think, pictured Poonghuzhali and her Kolli-vai pisaasus <br />there:-)- and indulged in a frantic photo-session. God knew what <br />Krupashankar was trying to do in the sea- we suddenly heard agonized yells <br />and looked back to see him scrabbling wildly after his slippers, which had <br />floated away on the waves:-).</p>
<p>It was a delightful hour. The waves glinted in the last rays of the sun, and <br />the marshland glowed in an unearthly light. Shadows fell everywhere, <br />suddenly transforming the sea-shore into another world- one full of strange <br />and beautiful entities. I for one fully expected Ravidasan to emerge out of <br />the sand dunes,:-)</p>
<p>And then, it was time to go. By 6.30 PM, a tired but exultant <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  crew <br />marched to the van, full of sea-water, shells and loads of Kodikarai sand- <br />only to be told sternly by our driver that he was not going to have his <br />clean van soiled by us in all our sand and filth. "enga venaa ukkarunga, <br />Mela venumnaa ukkarunga, anaa ulle gille vanthu asingam panneenga..."</acronym></p>
<p>It was at that moment, I think, that we all went crazy.:-)</p>
<p>[Later, we were all pretty sure that Poonghuzhali's 'aavi', floating around <br />the beaches of Kodikarai in spirit form, must have entered us all as <br />suitable to carry out her wishes- nothing else would explain what we <br />did.:-)]</p>
<p>One and all were hit by the same idea all at once. Kamal and Krupa darted <br />towards the rear, followed by Sathya, me, Anuradha, Lavanya, Radhika and <br />Viji- and before anyone knew what was happening, all of us had scrambled up <br />the slim ladder to the top of the carrier! It was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of a squeeze on top, <br />of course, with so many people- but that added to the general delight. All <br />the elders kept telling us that we were bound to fall off, that we'd have a <br />tough time making it to the vilage in one piece- and all their words fell on <br />deaf ears. We were determined on a 'crazy African Safari' (as Mr. Sharma put <br />it), and nothing would stop us.</acronym></p>
<p>The van driver gave up his eforts to get us down, and started his vehicle, <br />which gave a lurch and nearly upset some of us.:-)</p>
<p>And then started a weird and wonderful ride through the marshes of <br />Kodikarai- twilight had set in, the view from the top rolled away before our <br />eyes in all directions for miles, the sky was streaked with the blues and <br />pinks of sunset- in a word, it was superb.</p>
<p>The van went slowly, but there were the unavoidable humps and bumps in the <br />road, sending us all into yells whenever they happened. Krupashankar <br />proposed a contest to see who could stand up on the carrier, Lavanya was <br />seized by a desire to sing 'Alai kadalum oynthirukka..." (which she did:-), <br />and all of us were caught by the wonderful scenery. No deer were present, <br />but we suddenly came upon a lone and solitary...wild black horse, gambolling <br />in the flatlands! Of course, it must have been the horse ridden by the Oomai <br />Rani:-).</p>
<p>The original 'safari' was to have been until the gates of Kodikarai- but we <br />voted to ride on until the village was reached.</p>
<p>Sea-birds flew overheard, darkness was closing in, the lighthouse started <br />flashing (the only 'kolli-vai pisaasu' we could see) and the sea-wind <br />rippled across us. All around us, bushes and shrubs weaved along the road. <br />Some one from inside the van yelled to ask if we were all there on the roof, <br />and how many of us had been bumped off. The van obligingly gave another <br />lurch and set everyone screeching. All the animals and spirits must have <br />heard us for miles around:-)</p>
<p>Telephone wires began appearing, the mark of civlization- and then came the <br />agonizing question- we had climbed up easily enough, would climbing down be <br />that easy (especially Anuradha, -"...naan nadakkum pothE thoppu thoppunnu <br />vizhuven...":-)???</p>
<p>But we managed it. (see Krupa's photos:-). All the elders promptly got off <br />the van and stood around us, grinning and marking our 'progress' and <br />commenting wildly on how we must get down, where we must place our feet and <br />everything else. The locals gaped at this spectacular show.</p>
<p>Finally, all our dust left on the carrier, we settled down in our wet <br />clothes inside the van, playing 'Anthakshari' and generally fooling about. <br />Night had fallen and Kodikarai was left behind. Kudanthai was the night <br />halt, and when we reached it after three hours, and checked in Hotel <br />Chela's, all of us were ready for our rest.</p>
<p>(To be continued...)</p>

        <p>Hi Sreeram,<br />I have read <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  n number of times and clearly remember those writings about Ajantha paintings. Anyway thanks for your mail, since everytime anything about <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  or <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  is referred to I feel very happy. <br />Anyways, my point was that we need to preserve all those treasures. We need to do something soon. <br />Probably when time permits we can as a group visit those temples one by one and do some proper thirupani. <br />Poonguzhali<br />Sreeram Krishnamoorthy <sreekrish21@yahoo.com  wrote:Poonguzhali,</p>
<p>I remember in S.S kalki has written about those<br />azhiyatha chithirangal in the last volume. Naga Nandhi<br />says about those chithirangal to Paranjothi. He says<br />all the paintings are normally done by mixing leaves<br />and roots. But in ajantha they take naturally coloured<br />stones and mix so that those colour doesn't fade. I<br />don't know how far this is true but as i know this is<br />what mentioned in S.S.</p>
