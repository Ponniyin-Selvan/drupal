</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Sivapathasekaran,</p>
<p>I find many members of this group are very dedicated to their study on<br />the History of Cholas, and even arranging organised tours to places of<br />much historical interest in groups to discover many new informations<br />in their study on same.</p>
<p>I can remember one of your members (R.Venkatesh ???)writing in this<br />forum stating the informations given by me (in year 2004)- on<br />Palayilieswarem of Muththaraiyar king, and on Vijayalaya Chola who<br />captured Thanjavur from the Muttharaiyar king and made it his own<br />capital - kindled the interest of a group of people who made a special<br />visit to Narthamalai to read the inscription on the temples therein<br />and to acertain informations pertaining to the above and on Vijayalaya<br />Choliswarem.</p>
<p>With this in mind I thought of few other Projects, which will be of<br />much interest to all of us - if investigated at site, to further our<br />knowledge on Cholas.</p>
<p>(1) Unlike the Thanjavur Rajarajaeswarem the Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem<br />has only a few insriptions which could be read from the temple walls.<br />The outer walls of the former Thiruchchuttru of this temple is no<br />more, and I remember reading somewhere (Madras Gazetteer ???)that a<br />British Engineer during the colonial days have removed many stones<br />from the outer (Thiruchuttru) walls of Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem temple<br />and used it in his construction of a new Kallanai(???) over Kaveri Aru<br />at Thirutchi, and in another book (the title of which I cannot<br />remember),which states some inscriptions are still visible in this<br />structure on the stones used to construct same. It will be a very<br />usefull effort, if we could read these inscriptions that are said to<br />be visible to gather more informations of the period of Rajendra<br />Cholan - 1.</p>
<p>(2) An inscription in Chithambaram temple states that the Chola king<br />Kulothunga Cholan - 1 has installed in the "ethir ambalam" to the<br />Karuvarai (???} a stone shown as "Kaatchi" by the Kamboja king to him.<br />We could investigate whether this stone could be located in situ even<br />today and if so whether it bears any special royal insignia or<br />inscription on same, and to preserve same for historical purposes.</p>
<p>(3) After the victory of Kadarem by Rajendra Cholan - 1 it is said he<br />built a temple named Kadaremkonda Cholaeswarem at Kalavai in Vellore<br />region of Tamil Nadu. This temple bears the modern name as Bhumiswara<br />Temple. One of the inscription in this temple indicates it was earlier<br />known as Kadaremkonda Cholaeswarem. A visit to this temple and the<br />reading of all inscriptions in this temple will provide more light as<br />to who really built it, and also provide a study on the structure and<br />size of this temple - built after Rajendra's conquest of Kadarem of<br />Malaysia.</p>
<p>(4) Likewise after the victory of Sri Vijaya of Sumatra, Indonesia by<br />Rajendra Cholan - 1 it is said he built a temple by the name<br />Vijayamkonda Choliswarem some where close to the present<br />Kadambavanesvara temple at Erumbur (in Chidambaram taluk). An<br />inscription in this temple mentions the Vijayamkondasolisvaram Udaiyar<br />koyil. May be this temple or a temple adjacent to same might have been<br />the former Vijayamkonda Cholisvarem Udaiyar koyil. An at site<br />investigation and study on same will throw more light on this historic<br />temple and on the structure and the size of this temple.  </p>
<p>If any enthusiastic historical group ventures in the "at the Site<br />studies" of the above mentioned, it will immensely benefit all members<br />of this group in respect of their studies of the Cholas.</p>

<p>original central temple at chidambaram was razed to the ground by <br />malik kafur in 1312-1313 and again in 1320 by ulugh khan</p>
<p>the stone must have been lost forever in the debris</p>
<p>kudavayil -----kamboja was perhaps interpretted as kampuchea and as <br />vijay says a far eastern type of sculpture in darasuram made him make <br />that guess.<br />most propably was kannauj.</p>

<p>Dear Sivapathasekaran,</p>
<p>Could you very kindly enlighten me as to how Kudavayil<br />Balasubramaniyan come to the conclusion that the Kamboja Rajan -<br />Kaatchikkallu came to be under a dwaja sthambam in <br />Darasuram in Kumbakonam, from its original situ in Chithambaram<br />Temple. I am very much interested in knowing same. Please assist.</p>
<p>Thanking You</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

<p>Dear Sivapathasekaran,</p>
<p>Yes you are correct. Now I recollect that it was "you" who told me<br />about the interest that made a group to go to Narthamalai, nor R.<br />Venkatesh. Sorry.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>  FOLLOWING IS THE EXTRACT OF OUR COMUNICATION DEAR SRIHARI @ <br />  VIRARAJENDRA !! REGARDS / SPS</p>
<p>  SPS wrote in MSG 4354 dt: 13.7.2004 ::  </p>
<p>  Dear Srihari &amp; Gokul,</p>
<p>  Thanks for kindling interest in Mutharayas. We - Kamal - Ram - <br />  Lavanya - Krupa &amp; myself, under the guidance of Dr. Kalaikkovan and <br />  Dr. Nalini - visited Narathamalai (near Pudukkottai) (they have  <br />  visited Kurangunathar Temple of Srinivasanallur on previous <br />  Saturday) on Sunday.  </p>
<p>  We have spent the entire fore-noon session over there and <br />  studied the two cave temples of Nandhivarman - one rock temple by <br />  Pazhiyili. Ram / Lavanya / Kamal will put more details in their <br />  travellogue. This was a mercantile town in those days.</p>
<p>  In the down hill, Kadambar malai is located. The entire stretch of <br />  about 50 feet x 50 feet surface of the rock is filled with Sundara <br />  Pandiayan's inscriptions! Rajaraja / Rajendra inscriptions are <br />  found on the cut / dressed face of a rock panel - similar to the <br />  one of Ashoka's near Bhuvaneswar - Orissa! The entire scenerio is <br />  spell bounding and mystic! </p>
<p>  While returning, Dr.Kalaikkovan showed us a megalithic burial place <br />  (much bigger than Adhichanallur / T.Veli) sprawled in about 20 <br />  acres (10 acres on either side of the village road!) - yet to be <br />  excavated - even though ASI and Revenue Officials are aware of such <br />  existence for the past several decades!</p>
<p>  Fondly, sps</p>

<p>  You (Srihari) have said that Vijayalaya defeated sattan <br />      pazhiyili, the Muttaraiya. This is a news to me. No early books <br />    could <br />      quote the name of the muttaraiya defeated by vijayalaya.</p>
<p>      Muththaraiyars were the kings of Thanjavur prior to the <br />  emergence <br />    of <br />      the Cholas.</p>
<p>      possession of Thanjapuri" from the Muththaraiyars </p>
<p>  3rd <br />        year captured Thanjai. (853 AD)</p>
<p>      Sattan Paliyili was the son of Videlvidugu Muththaraiyan, was a <br />      Muththaraiyar king even though the inscription has not <br />  specifically <br />      mentioned of same. This inscription was issued in the 7th year <br />  of <br />    he <br />      Pallava king Nirupathunga, that is in (862+7)A.D.869. </p>
<p>      VERY MUCH INFORMATIVE.</p>
<p>      Dr. Nagaswamy, in his Mutharayar - defines them as Ganga Kings <br />  of <br />      Kongani belonging to Tamil Mudhu Velir kudi. Vridharaja @ <br />    Mutharayas!<br />      In 3rd &amp; 4th AD - ancient Tamil &amp; Kannada were similar.</p>
<p>      Dr. Kudavoil says Niyamam was an important town under <br />  Mutharayas. <br />      Quotes Sendalai Sundareswarar temple inscriptions : "Perumbidugu <br />      Mutharayan @ Kuvaran Maaran; his son Elango Vadhiyaraiyan @ <br />  Maaran <br />      Paremeswaran; his son Perumbidugu Mutharayan @ Suvaran Maaran.  <br />      Suvaran Maaran was also known as Vallakkoman.  </p>
<p>      Thiruvalangadu CP say: VIJAYALAYAN conquored THANJAI city <br />  comprised <br />      of white-lime plastered Beautiful palaces</p>
<p>      Neelakanta Sastry says Niyamam was Mutharayar's Capital. <br />  Historian <br />    SR <br />      Balasubramaninan concurrs; Pandarathar says the Capital was <br />    Sendalai.</p>
<p>      Because of the above, there was no concrete information to the <br />    effect <br />      that it was SATTAN PAZHIYILI who was conquored by Vijayalayan.  <br />  We <br />      will discuss it with present day historians..</p>
<p>      Navukkarasar hymns of Thanjai (Thalikkulathar) in VI Thirumurai;       Boothathazhwar &amp; Thirumangai hymn of Thanjai Maamanikkoil ..<br />      Sihma Vishnu F/O Mahendra was "Jitha Simha Vishnu .. Haraabhi <br />    Cholava <br />      Nichalaaye.." In his 6th yr, he donated Amannserkkai @ <br />      Thiruparuthikundram to a Jain St. Vajradanthi. In Trichy Rock <br />  Fort <br />      Temple Cave - engraving "Thanjaiharaha" denotes Simhavishnu.</p>
<p>      Today, if one travels from Pudukkottai to Thiruvaiyaru, he will <br />    cross <br />      NARTHAMALAI (about 15 Kms North of Pudkkottai) - Vallam (about <br />  45 <br />    KM <br />      North East of Pdkt)- Thanjai - about 12 Kms North of Vallam - <br />      Thirukkanidyir (about 10 Km North of Thanjai) - Niyamam (about 6 <br />  Km <br />      west of Thirukkandiyur). Pazhayarai 35 Kms East of Thanjai.</p>
<p>      Pudkukkottai - Thanjai - Nemam was under Mutharayars till 853 <br />  AD. <br />      Thirukkandiyur @ NANDHIPURAM was Pallavas Capital with Golden <br />    Palace. <br />      Vijayalayan (Pazhayarai) fought Pandyas under Pallavas.<br />      For having won the War at Thirupurambiyam (ref P.S.) Vijayalaya <br />  was <br />      given back Cholanadu. In the process of establishing his own <br />  Land, <br />      he should have fought with Mutharayas also and expanded to <br />  Vallam <br />    to <br />      Niyamam and retained Thanjai as his Capital.</p>
<p>      Beginning of a 400 yr long Glorified Golden Era!</p>
<p>      Tail piece: The Series of Lingas located on the Northern prakara <br />  of <br />      Big Temple are the left overs of Niyamam Aayirathali (Sahasra <br />    Lingas!)<br />      - positioned during Nayaks period..!- after Malikafur invasions.</p>
<p>      ===========================================================</p>
<p>    With this in mind I thought of few other Projects, which will be of<br />    much interest to all of us - if investigated at site, to further <br />  our<br />    knowledge on Cholas.</p>
<p>    (1) Unlike the Thanjavur Rajarajaeswarem the Gangaikonda <br />  Cholaeswarem<br />    has only a few insriptions which could be read from the temple <br />  walls.<br />    The outer walls of the former Thiruchchuttru of this temple is no<br />    more, and I remember reading somewhere (Madras Gazetteer ???)that a<br />    British Engineer during the colonial days have removed many stones<br />    from the outer (Thiruchuttru) walls of Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem <br />  temple<br />    and used it in his construction of a new Kallanai(???) over Kaveri <br />  Aru<br />    at Thirutchi, and in another book (the title of which I cannot<br />    remember),which states some inscriptions are still visible in this<br />    structure on the stones used to construct same. It will be a very<br />    usefull effort, if we could read these inscriptions that are said <br />  to<br />    be visible to gather more informations of the period of Rajendra<br />    Cholan - 1.</p>
<p>    (2) An inscription in Chithambaram temple states that the Chola <br />  king<br />    Kulothunga Cholan - 1 has installed in the "ethir ambalam" to the<br />    Karuvarai (???} a stone shown as "Kaatchi" by the Kamboja king to <br />  him.<br />    We could investigate whether this stone could be located in situ <br />  even<br />    today and if so whether it bears any special royal insignia or<br />    inscription on same, and to preserve same for historical purposes.</p>
<p>    (3) After the victory of Kadarem by Rajendra Cholan - 1 it is said <br />  he<br />    built a temple named Kadaremkonda Cholaeswarem at Kalavai in <br />  Vellore<br />    region of Tamil Nadu. This temple bears the modern name as <br />  Bhumiswara<br />    Temple. One of the inscription in this temple indicates it was <br />  earlier<br />    known as Kadaremkonda Cholaeswarem. A visit to this temple and the<br />    reading of all inscriptions in this temple will provide more light <br />  as<br />    to who really built it, and also provide a study on the structure <br />  and<br />    size of this temple - built after Rajendra's conquest of Kadarem of<br />    Malaysia.</p>
<p>    (4) Likewise after the victory of Sri Vijaya of Sumatra, Indonesia <br />  by<br />    Rajendra Cholan - 1 it is said he built a temple by the name<br />    Vijayamkonda Choliswarem some where close to the present<br />    Kadambavanesvara temple at Erumbur (in Chidambaram taluk). An<br />    inscription in this temple mentions the Vijayamkondasolisvaram <br />  Udaiyar<br />    koyil. May be this temple or a temple adjacent to same might have <br />  been<br />    the former Vijayamkonda Cholisvarem Udaiyar koyil. An at site<br />    investigation and study on same will throw more light on this <br />  historic<br />    temple and on the structure and the size of this temple.  </p>
<p>    If any enthusiastic historical group ventures in the "at the Site<br />    studies" of the above mentioned, it will immensely benefit all <br />  members<br />    of this group in respect of their studies of the Cholas.</p>

<p>hi venkatesh</p>
<p>Yes, that was tension filled. But K'balu sir's find was more a<br />sculpture - of that of an ankorian sytled lion. dont think our kings<br />would call a sculpture as kallu ( stone). it was defn some kind of<br />special stone that was shown to the chola king - kaatchiyaaga kattina<br />kallu. </p>

        <p>Dear virarajendra</p>
<p>Kaatchi Kallu presented by Kamboja king.</p>
<p>perhaps it was the kanauj (Kanyakubja), king who sent it for safety <br />when his kingdom was being attacked by ghazni or ghori(In 1019, the <br />town was sacked by Mahmud of Ghazni and the next few decades were <br />utter chaos)<br />so it was logical that a treasure was sent to the south for <br />safekeeping.</p>
<p>my personal experience with the kampuja stone is as wierd as fiction <br />itself.</p>
<p>i visualised the novel thillaiyil oru kollaikaran based on this stone.<br />i had taken huge liberties using my novelists licence but just before <br />the book was published there came a news that kudavoil <br />balasubramaniam had discovered the stone under a dwaja sthambam in <br />kumbakonam.<br />nothing came out of the discovery but was I scared? vijaykumar was of <br />immense support during those days.....</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<blockquote><p>  Your scanned copy of the Kalvettu from SII (No??)is useful to me as <br />I<br />  have only part of the inscription taken from another book but <br />without<br />  the year of the inscription. The year of the book is also given in <br />the<br />  Rangachariya's Inscriptions of the Madas Presidency, but confirmed <br />by<br />  your eye copy - thanks.  </p>
<p>  As mentioned by me ".... We could investigate whether this stone <br />could<br />  be located in situ even today and if so whether it bears any special<br />  royal insignia or inscription on same, and to preserve same for<br />  historical purposes....."</p>
<p>  While thanking you very much for providing the part eye copy of <br />same,<br />  if possible - I will be much pleased - if I could have the full eye<br />  copy of same for my further study. I donot have the full collection <br />of<br />  SII with me and I could not get at the full text of the Inscription<br />  with informations given by you in the latter part of your posting.</p>
<p>  In the meantime please advice me as to how to post scanned documents<br />  in tnis Forum. I have a research article of mine written in Tamil - <br />on<br />  a referance in a Tamil text of the medieval period which speaks <br />about<br />  Rajendra Chola - 1 and Kulothunga Chola - 1 South-East Asian<br />  expedition written many years ago, which presently I have no time to<br />  translate in to English and post in this forum. I prefer to scan and<br />  post same in this Forum in the Tamil format. </p>
<p>  Awaiting your assistance.</p>
<p>  Further the references in Rangachariya's book on Inscriptions of the<br />  Madras Presidency (Vol - 1,page 105-6, Nos - 615,617 &amp; 618 gives<br />  details of the Kadaremkonda Choliswaramudaiya Nayanar temple <br />(present<br />  Bhumiswara temple at Kudimallur (Gudimallur - reffered as Malliyur <br />in<br />  the inscriptions)at Vellore district near present Kalavai.</p>
<p>  Also the details of the references in Rangachariya's book on<br />  Inscriptions of the Madras Presidency (Vol - 1,page 152, No - 188<br />  gives details of the Vijayamkondaeswarem (present Kadambavanesvara<br />  temple)at Kudimallur (Gudimallur - refered as Malliyur in the<br />  inscriptions)at Vellore district near present Kalavai.</p>
<p>  It is worth while investigating on other inscriptions in this temple<br />  and indentifying the actual Vijayamkonda Choliswarem temple, and <br />also<br />  on the Inscriptions on the Kallanai as mentioned by me.</p>
<p>  Thanks</p>
<p>  Regards</p>
<p>  Anbudan - Virarajendra.</p>

<p>FOLLOWING IS THE EXTRACT OF OUR COMUNICATION DEAR SRIHARI @ <br />VIRARAJENDRA !! REGARDS / SPS</p>
<p>SPS wrote in MSG 4354 dt: 13.7.2004 ::  </p>
<p>Dear Srihari &amp; Gokul,</p>
<p>Thanks for kindling interest in Mutharayas. We - Kamal - Ram - <br />Lavanya - Krupa &amp; myself, under the guidance of Dr. Kalaikkovan and <br />Dr. Nalini - visited Narathamalai (near Pudukkottai) (they have  <br />visited Kurangunathar Temple of Srinivasanallur on previous <br />Saturday) on Sunday.  </p>
<p>We have spent the entire fore-noon session over there and <br />studied the two cave temples of Nandhivarman - one rock temple by <br />Pazhiyili. Ram / Lavanya / Kamal will put more details in their <br />travellogue. This was a mercantile town in those days.</p>
<p>In the down hill, Kadambar malai is located. The entire stretch of <br />about 50 feet x 50 feet surface of the rock is filled with Sundara <br />Pandiayan's inscriptions! Rajaraja / Rajendra inscriptions are <br />found on the cut / dressed face of a rock panel - similar to the <br />one of Ashoka's near Bhuvaneswar - Orissa! The entire scenerio is <br />spell bounding and mystic! </p>
<p>While returning, Dr.Kalaikkovan showed us a megalithic burial place <br />(much bigger than Adhichanallur / T.Veli) sprawled in about 20 <br />acres (10 acres on either side of the village road!) - yet to be <br />excavated - even though <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  and Revenue Officials are aware of such <br />existence for the past several decades!</acronym></p>
<p>Fondly, sps</p>

<p>You (Srihari) have said that Vijayalaya defeated sattan </p>
<blockquote><p>    pazhiyili, the Muttaraiya. This is a news to me. No early books <br />  could <br />    quote the name of the muttaraiya defeated by vijayalaya.</p>
<p>    Muththaraiyars were the kings of Thanjavur prior to the <br />emergence <br />  of <br />    the Cholas.</p>
<p>    possession of Thanjapuri" from the Muththaraiyars </p>
<p>3rd <br />      year captured Thanjai. (853 AD)</p>
<p>    Sattan Paliyili was the son of Videlvidugu Muththaraiyan, was a <br />    Muththaraiyar king even though the inscription has not <br />specifically <br />    mentioned of same. This inscription was issued in the 7th year <br />of <br />  he <br />    Pallava king Nirupathunga, that is in (862+7)A.D.869. </p>
<p>    VERY MUCH INFORMATIVE.</p>
<p>    Dr. Nagaswamy, in his Mutharayar - defines them as Ganga Kings <br />of <br />    Kongani belonging to Tamil Mudhu Velir kudi. Vridharaja @ <br />  Mutharayas!<br />    In 3rd &amp; 4th AD - ancient Tamil &amp; Kannada were similar.</p>
<p>    Dr. Kudavoil says Niyamam was an important town under <br />Mutharayas. <br />    Quotes Sendalai Sundareswarar temple inscriptions : "Perumbidugu <br />    Mutharayan @ Kuvaran Maaran; his son Elango Vadhiyaraiyan @ <br />Maaran <br />    Paremeswaran; his son Perumbidugu Mutharayan @ Suvaran Maaran.  <br />    Suvaran Maaran was also known as Vallakkoman.  </p>
<p>    Thiruvalangadu CP say: VIJAYALAYAN conquored THANJAI city <br />comprised <br />    of white-lime plastered Beautiful palaces</p>
<p>    Neelakanta Sastry says Niyamam was Mutharayar's Capital. <br />Historian <br />  SR <br />    Balasubramaninan concurrs; Pandarathar says the Capital was <br />  Sendalai.</p>
<p>    Because of the above, there was no concrete information to the <br />  effect <br />    that it was SATTAN PAZHIYILI who was conquored by Vijayalayan.  <br />We <br />    will discuss it with present day historians..</p>
<p>    Navukkarasar hymns of Thanjai (Thalikkulathar) in VI Thirumurai;     Boothathazhwar &amp; Thirumangai hymn of Thanjai Maamanikkoil ..<br />    Sihma Vishnu F/O Mahendra was "Jitha Simha Vishnu .. Haraabhi <br />  Cholava <br />    Nichalaaye.." In his 6th yr, he donated Amannserkkai @ <br />    Thiruparuthikundram to a Jain St. Vajradanthi. In Trichy Rock <br />Fort <br />    Temple Cave - engraving "Thanjaiharaha" denotes Simhavishnu.</p>
<p>    Today, if one travels from Pudukkottai to Thiruvaiyaru, he will <br />  cross <br />    NARTHAMALAI (about 15 Kms North of Pudkkottai) - Vallam (about <br />45 <br />  KM <br />    North East of Pdkt)- Thanjai - about 12 Kms North of Vallam - <br />    Thirukkanidyir (about 10 Km North of Thanjai) - Niyamam (about 6 <br />Km <br />    west of Thirukkandiyur). Pazhayarai 35 Kms East of Thanjai.</p>
<p>    Pudkukkottai - Thanjai - Nemam was under Mutharayars till 853 <br />AD. <br />    Thirukkandiyur @ NANDHIPURAM was Pallavas Capital with Golden <br />  Palace. <br />    Vijayalayan (Pazhayarai) fought Pandyas under Pallavas.<br />    For having won the War at Thirupurambiyam (ref P.S.) Vijayalaya <br />was <br />    given back Cholanadu. In the process of establishing his own <br />Land, <br />    he should have fought with Mutharayas also and expanded to <br />Vallam <br />  to <br />    Niyamam and retained Thanjai as his Capital.</p>
<p>    Beginning of a 400 yr long Glorified Golden Era!</p>
<p>    Tail piece: The Series of Lingas located on the Northern prakara <br />of <br />    Big Temple are the left overs of Niyamam Aayirathali (Sahasra <br />  Lingas!)<br />    - positioned during Nayaks period..!- after Malikafur invasions.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>    ===========================================================</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  With this in mind I thought of few other Projects, which will be of<br />  much interest to all of us - if investigated at site, to further <br />our<br />  knowledge on Cholas.</p>
<p>  (1) Unlike the Thanjavur Rajarajaeswarem the Gangaikonda <br />Cholaeswarem<br />  has only a few insriptions which could be read from the temple <br />walls.<br />  The outer walls of the former Thiruchchuttru of this temple is no<br />  more, and I remember reading somewhere (Madras Gazetteer ???)that a<br />  British Engineer during the colonial days have removed many stones<br />  from the outer (Thiruchuttru) walls of Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem <br />temple<br />  and used it in his construction of a new Kallanai(???) over Kaveri <br />Aru<br />  at Thirutchi, and in another book (the title of which I cannot<br />  remember),which states some inscriptions are still visible in this<br />  structure on the stones used to construct same. It will be a very<br />  usefull effort, if we could read these inscriptions that are said <br />to<br />  be visible to gather more informations of the period of Rajendra<br />  Cholan - 1.</p>
<p>  (2) An inscription in Chithambaram temple states that the Chola <br />king<br />  Kulothunga Cholan - 1 has installed in the "ethir ambalam" to the<br />  Karuvarai (???} a stone shown as "Kaatchi" by the Kamboja king to <br />him.<br />  We could investigate whether this stone could be located in situ <br />even<br />  today and if so whether it bears any special royal insignia or<br />  inscription on same, and to preserve same for historical purposes.</p>
<p>  (3) After the victory of Kadarem by Rajendra Cholan - 1 it is said <br />he<br />  built a temple named Kadaremkonda Cholaeswarem at Kalavai in <br />Vellore<br />  region of Tamil Nadu. This temple bears the modern name as <br />Bhumiswara<br />  Temple. One of the inscription in this temple indicates it was <br />earlier<br />  known as Kadaremkonda Cholaeswarem. A visit to this temple and the<br />  reading of all inscriptions in this temple will provide more light <br />as<br />  to who really built it, and also provide a study on the structure <br />and<br />  size of this temple - built after Rajendra's conquest of Kadarem of<br />  Malaysia.</p>
<p>  (4) Likewise after the victory of Sri Vijaya of Sumatra, Indonesia <br />by<br />  Rajendra Cholan - 1 it is said he built a temple by the name<br />  Vijayamkonda Choliswarem some where close to the present<br />  Kadambavanesvara temple at Erumbur (in Chidambaram taluk). An<br />  inscription in this temple mentions the Vijayamkondasolisvaram <br />Udaiyar<br />  koyil. May be this temple or a temple adjacent to same might have <br />been<br />  the former Vijayamkonda Cholisvarem Udaiyar koyil. An at site<br />  investigation and study on same will throw more light on this <br />historic<br />  temple and on the structure and the size of this temple.  </p>
<p>  If any enthusiastic historical group ventures in the "at the Site<br />  studies" of the above mentioned, it will immensely benefit all <br />members<br />  of this group in respect of their studies of the Cholas.</p>

<p>Dear Vijay Kumar,</p>
<p>I am thankful to you for taking so much of pain to give me<br />informations on the Kaatchi Kallu presented by Kamboja king.<br />Your scanned copy of the Kalvettu from SII (No??)is useful to me as I<br />have only part of the inscription taken from another book but without<br />the year of the inscription. The year of the book is also given in the<br />Rangachariya's Inscriptions of the Madas Presidency, but confirmed by<br />your eye copy - thanks.  </p>
<p>As mentioned by me ".... We could investigate whether this stone could<br />be located in situ even today and if so whether it bears any special<br />royal insignia or inscription on same, and to preserve same for<br />historical purposes....."</p>
<p>While thanking you very much for providing the part eye copy of same,<br />if possible - I will be much pleased - if I could have the full eye<br />copy of same for my further study. I donot have the full collection of<br />SII with me and I could not get at the full text of the Inscription<br />with informations given by you in the latter part of your posting.</p>
<p>In the meantime please advice me as to how to post scanned documents<br />in tnis Forum. I have a research article of mine written in Tamil - on<br />a referance in a Tamil text of the medieval period which speaks about<br />Rajendra Chola - 1 and Kulothunga Chola - 1 South-East Asian<br />expedition written many years ago, which presently I have no time to<br />translate in to English and post in this forum. I prefer to scan and<br />post same in this Forum in the Tamil format. </p>
<p>Awaiting your assistance.</p>
<p>Further the references in Rangachariya's book on Inscriptions of the<br />Madras Presidency (Vol - 1,page 105-6, Nos - 615,617 &amp; 618 gives<br />details of the Kadaremkonda Choliswaramudaiya Nayanar temple (present<br />Bhumiswara temple at Kudimallur (Gudimallur - reffered as Malliyur in<br />the inscriptions)at Vellore district near present Kalavai.</p>
<p>Also the details of the references in Rangachariya's book on<br />Inscriptions of the Madras Presidency (Vol - 1,page 152, No - 188<br />gives details of the Vijayamkondaeswarem (present Kadambavanesvara<br />temple)at Kudimallur (Gudimallur - refered as Malliyur in the<br />inscriptions)at Vellore district near present Kalavai.</p>
<p>It is worth while investigating on other inscriptions in this temple<br />and indentifying the actual Vijayamkonda Choliswarem temple, and also<br />on the Inscriptions on the Kallanai as mentioned by me.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<blockquote><p>  (2) An inscription in Chithambaram temple states that the Chola king<br />  Kulothunga Cholan - 1 has installed in the "ethir ambalam" to the<br />  Karuvarai (???} a stone shown as "Kaatchi" by the Kamboja king to him.<br />  We could investigate whether this stone could be located in situ even<br />  today and if so whether it bears any special royal insignia or<br />  inscription on same, and to preserve same for historical purposes.</p>

<p>1) South Indian Shrines By P. V. Jagadisa Ayyar</p>
<p>A precious stone given to chola king rajendra by king of kambojia<br />was inserted into the hall of god.</p>
<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books" title="http://books.google.com/books">http://books.google.com/books</a>?</p>
<p>2) also checked the reference in - Hultsch E., (Ed) Epigraphia<br />Indica, Vol V, 1889-99, pp 105-106; Ancient Kamboja, People and the<br />Country, 1981, p 10, 333]</p>
<p>(L. 10.) A stone was exhibited by the Kamboja king before the<br />glorious Rajendra- Choladeva* This (stone) was, by order of the lord<br />Rajendra choladeva, placed in front of the shrine of the god who is<br />the lord of Tirucitrambalam, This stone was placed in the<br />upper front row of stones of the hall opposite the shrine.</p>
<p>trying to get the actual tamil words as below:</p>
<p>Rajendra sola devarku kambosarajan katchiyaaga kattina kallu, idu<br />udaiyar rajendra sola devar tiruvaai molindaruli udaiyar<br />tiruchrirramblam udaiyar koyilil mun vaittadu indakkallu tiruvedir<br />ambalattu tiru kkai sarattil tiru mum pattikku melai ppattiyille<br />vaittadu<br />===========================================</p>
<p>The first portion of the inscription records donations made to the<br />temple at Chidambaram<br />Tillai, 11, 7 and 9, or Tiruchchirrambalam, 1. 12) by Kundavai<br />Alvar, (the daughter of)<br />rajaraja and yonnger sister of Kulottunga-Chola. She presented the<br />god with a golden<br />easel (1. 3) and a mirror (1. 10) and covered (the roof of) the<br />shrine with gold (L 8),<br />the second portion (11. 10-14) states that a stone which the king of<br />Kamboja had given to<br />rajendra Chola was, by order of the latter, inserted into the wall<br />of a hall in front of the shrine,<br />Of the names mentioned in the preceding paragraph, Kulottunga-Chola,<br />(1, 1 f.) and rajendra chola (11. 10 and 11) refer to the reigning<br />king Kulottunga-Chola I., who is known to hv<br />have originally borne the name Rajendra-Chola (II,) and to have<br />subsequently assumed the<br />name Kulottunga. 4 Rajaraja, the father of Kulothunga's younger<br />sister Kundavai (11, 2 and<br />is identical with the Eastern Chaiukya king Rajaraja I.
