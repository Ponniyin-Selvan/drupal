<p>          Hi Maloo and ravi</p>
<p>          one last post before I too join in the "paayasam like posts"</p>
<p>          I would feel kalki realy sugarcoated ( or in hasher terms)brainwashed us with gentle storylines in PS.<br />          i feel SS and even the starting of parthiban kanavu( no chola warrior returned alive from the batlefield...) were truer to history<br />          even in PS its not kalki's fault but ours when we forget the gorybeheading of vira pandiyan.</p>
<p>          its so romantic when the greatest warrior in our history rides anelphant in flooding rivers to save a sparrow's nest and it goes straigh toour heart. but then could have RRC found a line in our history books without treading in blood soaked battlefields?<br />          venketesh</p>
<p>            Ravi, yes definitely i agree with you that Mahendravarman was afascinating character.</p>
<p>            I am not some naive person to think all jains are 'docile' people as much as I dont' think all hindus are 'tolerant' people. It is not really a choice between flagellation and glorification - history is just a collection of facts many of which may be hard to digest. When we go down this part of self serving one liners - Hindus killed less people than other faiths so that is ok, hatred by hindu saints was only in writing so it does notmatter (whoever said pen is mightier than the sword ?!) and so on, we haveto see what other 'one liners' can come as retorts from the other side as well. </p>
<p>            Yes i see what you say on the contradictions in the text. Don'twe have our share of contradictions in our texts as well - so does the bible and so does everything else. The whole point is can we put the gory bloody past behind us and work towards the future without blame or engage in this exercise that 'we' are better than 'them' and continue to fuel mutual hatred?</p>

<p>              The holier than thou does not stand good in any religion, there have been brutal - barbaric wars in the name of religion, the art of disintegration of any society is inevitable and if you look at history close enough you can conclude that it is... a part of evolution. </p>
<p>              As far as Jainisum is concerned, there is more that is under the surface than that is portrayed. The history of Jains and their conceptshave to be really grilled prior to reaching a conclusion on 'oh they are avery docile group'. </p>

<p>              Kharavela ruled Kalinga sometime in 2nd CE, a follower of Jain religion, virtually anihillated his enemies including the Jain king at Magada. I find it hard to believe where in Jain articles do we find atrocities towards humans is acceptable but against animals is not. </p>

<p>                  The Siva/Vishnu sects have fought a lot of wars with various invasions (Kalabaras / Jain - Budha / Sultanate assaults / Modern thoughts (for want of another term to avoid side tracks). </p>

<p>        Hi Maloo and ravi</p>
<p>        one last post before I too join in the "paayasam like posts"</p>
<p>        I would feel kalki realy sugarcoated ( or in hasher terms)brainwashed us with gentle storylines in PS.<br />        i feel SS and even the starting of parthiban kanavu( no chola warrior returned alive from the batlefield...) were truer to history<br />        even in PS its not kalki's fault but ours when we forget the gory beheading of vira pandiyan.</p>
<p>        its so romantic when the greatest warrior in our history rides an elphant in flooding rivers to save a sparrow's nest and it goes straigh to our heart. but then could have RRC found a line in our history books withouttreading in blood soaked battlefields?<br />        venketesh</p>
<p>          Ravi, yes definitely i agree with you that Mahendravarman was a fascinating character.</p>
<p>          I am not some naive person to think all jains are 'docile' peopleas much as I dont' think all hindus are 'tolerant' people. It is not really a choice between flagellation and glorification - history is just a collection of facts many of which may be hard to digest. When we go down this part of self serving one liners - Hindus killed less people than other faithsso that is ok, hatred by hindu saints was only in writing so it does not matter (whoever said pen is mightier than the sword ?!) and so on, we have to see what other 'one liners' can come as retorts from the other side as well. </p>
<p>          Yes i see what you say on the contradictions in the text. Don't we have our share of contradictions in our texts as well - so does the bibleand so does everything else. The whole point is can we put the gory bloodypast behind us and work towards the future without blame or engage in thisexercise that 'we' are better than 'them' and continue to fuel mutual hatred?</p>

<p>        Ravi, yes definitely i agree with you that Mahendravarman was a fascinating character.</p>
<p>        I am not some naive person to think all jains are 'docile' people as much as I dont' think all hindus are 'tolerant' people. It is not really a choice between flagellation and glorification - history is just a collection of facts many of which may be hard to digest. When we go down this partof self serving one liners - Hindus killed less people than other faiths so that is ok, hatred by hindu saints was only in writing so it does not matter (whoever said pen is mightier than the sword ?!) and so on, we have to see what other 'one liners' can come as retorts from the other side as well. </p>
<p>        Yes i see what you say on the contradictions in the text. Don't we have our share of contradictions in our texts as well - so does the bible and so does everything else. The whole point is can we put the gory bloody past behind us and work towards the future without blame or engage in this exercise that 'we' are better than 'them' and continue to fuel mutual hatred?</p>

<p>          Kharavela ruled Kalinga sometime in 2nd CE, a follower of Jain religion, virtually anihillated his enemies including the Jain king at Magada. I find it hard to believe where in Jain articles do we find atrocities towards humans is acceptable but against animals is not. </p>

<p>            Instead of sweating efforts in trying to determine hindus were less killers than any other religion which may be a statistical fact perhaps how about focusing on unity of faiths in the present? There are several hindu temples in present day which are liberally contributed by Jains.

<p>            I think the whole line of argument making us hindus to be holier than thou than others is meaningless.

<p>                  in the 7th and 8th centuries of tamilnadu there was a huge war of  <br />                  religion .</p>
<p>                  jains on one side and hindus on another ( whether shaivism and  <br />                  vaishnavism were part of the same religion or not is another  <br />                  debatable point)<br />                  the two great empires of tamilnadu pallavas and pandyas were ruled  <br />                  by jains.<br />                  highly biased opinions can be expected from both side. there was a  <br />                  lot of killing, maimim, and torture going on.<br />                  a jain monk converts to hinduism at the age of 50 . the pallava  <br />                  king tortureshim. finally after having beaten fire and raging  <br />                  elephants he was thrown into the sea with a huge rock tied to him.<br />                  the sinker becomes the float and the convert escapes.<br />                  during his exile he meets a young , shall i say, prodigy who takes  <br />                  it on himself to convert the land back to hinduism. he journeys  <br />                  into pandya land where his foes the jains hold control over the  <br />                  king himself. the king nedumaran fortunately has a wife and a prime  <br />                  minister who are hindus who invite the prodigy to cure the king of  <br />                  his raging fever.<br />                  the boy just does that with his holy ash, converst the king and  <br />                  then hold you breath a few thousand jains are impaled on stakes.</p>
<p>                  the pallavas too converted and the jains were a relious sect on the  <br />                  run</p>

<p>  one last post before I too join in the "paayasam like posts"</p>
<p>  I would feel kalki realy sugarcoated ( or in hasher terms)brainwashed us with gentle storylines in PS.<br />  i feel SS and even the starting of parthiban kanavu( no chola warrior returned alive from the batlefield...) were truer to history<br />  even in PS its not kalki's fault but ours when we forget the gory beheading of vira pandiyan.</p>
<p>  its so romantic when the greatest warrior in our history rides an elphantin flooding rivers to save a sparrow's nest and it goes straigh to our heart. but then could have RRC found a line in our history books without treading in blood soaked battlefields?<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    Ravi, yes definitely i agree with you that Mahendravarman was a fascinating character.</p>
<p>    I am not some naive person to think all jains are 'docile' people as much as I dont' think all hindus are 'tolerant' people. It is not really a choice between flagellation and glorification - history is just a collection of facts many of which may be hard to digest. When we go down this part of self serving one liners - Hindus killed less people than other faiths so that is ok, hatred by hindu saints was only in writing so it does not matter (whoever said pen is mightier than the sword ?!) and so on, we have to see what other 'one liners' can come as retorts from the other side as well. </p>
<p>    Yes i see what you say on the contradictions in the text. Don't we haveour share of contradictions in our texts as well - so does the bible and so does everything else. The whole point is can we put the gory bloody past behind us and work towards the future without blame or engage in this exercise that 'we' are better than 'them' and continue to fuel mutual hatred?</p>

<p>      Malathi: I understand the difference in reality vs history in case ofmahendravarman. His is somewhat interesting - more like the bollywood style - Son of the famous father Simhavishnu - staunch shaivaite, converts to Jain - torments saints of Nayanmar / Alwars - reconverts to Shaiva - gets into a mess with Pulikesi - Builds the great stone temple monuments and...gives us a son who is a hercules of sorts...<br />      Hence his life is something that is wanting a deep analysis.</p>
<p>      The holier than thou does not stand good in any religion, there have been brutal - barbaric wars in the name of religion, the art of disintegration of any society is inevitable and if you look at history close enough you can conclude that it is... a part of evolution. </p>
<p>      As far as Jainisum is concerned, there is more that is under the surface than that is portrayed. The history of Jains and their concepts have tobe really grilled prior to reaching a conclusion on 'oh they are a very docile group'. </p>

<p>      Kharavela ruled Kalinga sometime in 2nd CE, a follower of Jain religion, virtually anihillated his enemies including the Jain king at Magada. I find it hard to believe where in Jain articles do we find atrocities towards humans is acceptable but against animals is not. </p>

<p>        Ravi, the Mahendravaram who tormented Appar really existed. Kalki'sMahendravarman was fictional with some basis in reality. What do we want to belive, honestly that tells more about us than Mahendravarman or Kalki orAppar.</p>
<p>        Instead of sweating efforts in trying to determine hindus were lesskillers than any other religion which may be a statistical fact perhaps how about focusing on unity of faiths in the present? There are several hindutemples in present day which are liberally contributed by Jains. Even the hindu temple near where I live has a Jain deity inside and would not have come to existence without the jain community. </p>
<p>        I think the whole line of argument making us hindus to be holier than thou than others is meaningless. In fact if I were a Jain my religion thinks killing all lives including animal and birds is a crime. Undoubtedly hindus eat lot more non veg then and are more killers ?:))<br />        Just a different line of thinking...</p>

<p>          The Siva/Vishnu sects have fought a lot of wars with various invasions (Kalabaras / Jain - Budha / Sultanate assaults / Modern thoughts (forwant of another term to avoid side tracks). </p>
<p>          These sects have typically been the real kings on the southern side.</p>
<p>          I think the jains to have been killed in thousands was more of a poetic note.<br />          That brings another question, do we believe the Mahendravarman ofKalki or Mahendravarman who tormented Appar ?</p>

        <p>Hi Maloo and ravi</p>
<p>one last post before I too join in the "paayasam like posts"</p>
<p>I would feel kalki realy sugarcoated ( or in hasher terms)brainwashed us with gentle storylines in PS.<br />i feel SS and even the starting of parthiban kanavu( no chola warrior returned alive from the batlefield...) were truer to history<br />even in PS its not kalki's fault but ours when we forget the gory beheadingof vira pandiyan.</p>
<p>its so romantic when the greatest warrior in our history rides an elphant in flooding rivers to save a sparrow's nest and it goes straigh to our heart. but then could have RRC found a line in our history books without treading in blood soaked battlefields?<br />venketesh</p>
<blockquote><p>  Ravi, yes definitely i agree with you that Mahendravarman was a fascinating character.</p>
<p>  I am not some naive person to think all jains are 'docile' people as muchas I dont' think all hindus are 'tolerant' people. It is not really a choice between flagellation and glorification - history is just a collection offacts many of which may be hard to digest. When we go down this part of self serving one liners - Hindus killed less people than other faiths so thatis ok, hatred by hindu saints was only in writing so it does not matter (whoever said pen is mightier than the sword ?!) and so on, we have to see what other 'one liners' can come as retorts from the other side as well. </p>
<p>  Yes i see what you say on the contradictions in the text. Don't we have our share of contradictions in our texts as well - so does the bible and so does everything else. The whole point is can we put the gory bloody past behind us and work towards the future without blame or engage in this exercise that 'we' are better than 'them' and continue to fuel mutual hatred?</p>
<p>  I am stopping here and getting back to payasam like posts,</p>

<p>      I think the whole line of argument making us hindus to be holier thanthou than others is meaningless.

        <p>Malathi: I understand the difference in reality vs history in case of mahendravarman. His is somewhat interesting - more like the bollywood style - Son of the famous father Simhavishnu - staunch shaivaite, converts to Jain - torments saints of Nayanmar / Alwars - reconverts to Shaiva - gets into a mess with Pulikesi - Builds the great stone temple monuments and...gives us a son who is a hercules of sorts...<br />Hence his life is something that is wanting a deep analysis.</p>
<p>The holier than thou does not stand good in any religion, there have been brutal - barbaric wars in the name of religion, the art of disintegration ofany society is inevitable and if you look at history close enough you can conclude that it is... a part of evolution. </p>
<p>As far as Jainisum is concerned, there is more that is under the surface than that is portrayed. The history of Jains and their concepts have to be really grilled prior to reaching a conclusion on 'oh they are a very docile group'. </p>

<p>Kharavela ruled Kalinga sometime in 2nd CE, a follower of Jain religion, virtually anihillated his enemies including the Jain king at Magada. I find it hard to believe where in Jain articles do we find atrocities towards humans is acceptable but against animals is not. </p>
<p>Lets face it, no religion has got clean linen in its backyard.</p>

<p>Not directly to ennayiram..the article is regarding the movie Dasavatharm,but in between Jayamohan (naan kadavul dialogue writer) talks about the religious wars we talk about. He makes more logical sense.</p>

        <p>Hi there has been a lot of threads on this topic.</p>
<p>The Siva/Vishnu sects have fought a lot of wars with various invasions (Kalabaras / Jain - Budha / Sultanate assaults / Modern thoughts (for want of another term to avoid side tracks). </p>
<p>These sects have typically been the real kings on the southern side.</p>
<p>I think the jains to have been killed in thousands was more of a poetic note.<br />That brings another question, do we believe the Mahendravarman of Kalki or Mahendravarman who tormented Appar ?</p>

<p>        The emphasis on skin tone..is more up north than in south, most north indian heroes are fair skinned with sack-of-potatoes like body but stillregarded as handsome.

<blockquote><p>  Jain saints yes, very un-self conscious people. It takes a high degree ofspiritual evolvement to be like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>in dalavanur we had the cave temples adjoining the fields. climbing the rock on which the cave had been excavated on small rock cut steps we came to aset of jain beds on a rock surface a hundred feet high.</p>
<p>itr semed like a perfect hide out. rocks leaning on each other prevented sun from any angle, and the hollow inbetween was tunneling wind. the place was very cool. there must have been shallow rock depressions which held onto the rain water.</p>
<p>why a hide out- from there one could see a great distance without being sen.<br />i imagined jain monks on the run from the converted pallava hiding there from his vengance.<br />the cut out beds were shallow and smoothened, when fsting jains on their last round of life had their bones jutting out this smoothness helped them from pain i was told.</p>
