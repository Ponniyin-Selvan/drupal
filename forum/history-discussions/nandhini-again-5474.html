<p>kalki starts off very much portraying her as a villee - but then <br />credit to him, he does no damage to her image/integrity and in the end <br />we even feel sad for her plight...</p>

<p>      No. I dont agree with you. I am also not so<br />    impressed<br />      by Vanathi's charecter. But degrading her<br />    gaurdian's<br />      motive is unacceptable. Her gaurdian wanted<br />    Vanathi to<br />      be with safe and loving hands of Kundavai.</p>
<p>    hi sir</p>
<p>    those werent purely my opinion - i suggest you read<br />    chapter 15 of the <br />    first book - vanathiyin jaalam - the whole episode<br />    kalki devotes to <br />    what the other women friends of kundavai think of<br />    vanathi and her <br />    motives/action..... </p>
<p>    its a lovely episode /dialogue between varini,<br />    niravathi and <br />    sentiru. ...the text goes somewhat like this - all<br />    this is vanathi's <br />    acting prowess - how come she drops the aarathi<br />    while holding it with <br />    both her hands, and is amv a lion or tiger to see<br />    and faint - its all <br />    part of her guise to grab his attn. it goes on to<br />    say how smart was <br />    her fainting action etc etc. - but our prince and<br />    princess have fallen <br />    for her guise..</p>
<p>    poiyum , punaisorutum jaalamum, maaimalamum<br />    seigiravarukku than ithu <br />    kaalam.....</p>

<p>    further read the musings of malayiamaan,<br />    samboovaryar and periya <br />    velalar - they were all kings of their own domain -<br />    there was no need <br />    to send vanathi to recouperate with kundavai. its<br />    plain and open - <br />    shaadi.com / bharatmatrimoney.com</p>

<p>  those werent purely my opinion - i suggest you read<br />  chapter 15 of the <br />  first book - vanathiyin jaalam - the whole episode<br />  kalki devotes to <br />  what the other women friends of kundavai think of<br />  vanathi and her <br />  motives/action..... </p>

<p>    Hi Priya,</p>
<p>    That was fantastic analysis of Vanthi. After<br />  seeing so many bashes on<br />    her, your post was quiet a change to read.</p>
<p>    regards,<br />    siva.</p>
<p>  Hello.....this is too much.</p>
<p>  Vanathi was sent to live with kundavai by her<br />  relatives knowing very <br />  well that there would be lot of eligible bacherlors<br />  there - it was a <br />  political pitch. would you send your daughter to<br />  live like a maid to <br />  not even the chola queen but to the chola<br />  princess.....she was a <br />  glorified panippen. summa akka akka nu kundavaikku<br />  sombu tooki .....</p>
<p>  she was the bait for the political aspirations of<br />  her clan and she <br />  played her part - so lets not pretend that she is<br />  some innocent <br />  damsel. </p>
<p>  you can see this is the conversations of velalars,<br />  sambuvarayars and <br />  even malaiamaan ( famous intro scene of ak with<br />  thatta and partibendra <br />  pallavan)</p>
<p>  for all you know she might have acted to swoon to<br />  get the attn of <br />  arulmozhi among all those good looking maidens...and<br />  it worked !! all <br />  the chieftains vied with each other to get their<br />  daughters into the <br />  chola royalty. vanathy onnum ethuvum teriyatha pappa<br />  illai. the <br />  strategy worked for velalars while it failed for the<br />  samboovarayars....</p>

I request those to go thru the book<br again. Actually she is potrayed as being very<br practical unlike Poonguzhali who always dreams of so<br many things and accomplishes only one or two in the<br end and that too not in the way she dreamt of.<br <br In case of vanathy she has only two goals/ambitions or<br whatever you call, in her life. One is to beget a son<br who could avenge her father's defeat before she met<br arulmozhi. And after meeting arulmozhi, marrying him<br was the anotherone. Kalki has mentioned very clearly<br that at first she had only this thought of begetting a<br son who is very brave. She often dreams about<br />her<br />son<br coming to her after emerging as victorious in all the<br battles hefought and thus making her proud. At this<br stage, she is not really bothered about her husband to<br be. He can be any X or Y.<br <br Once she met arulmozhi she thinks that she could not<br accept anyone but arulmozhi as her husband. So her<br thought of begetting a brave son becomes complex cause<br now it has to be thru arulmozhi only. And now this<br second thought must be fullfilled , then only she can<br think about her first ambition. And there were many<br pblms in marrying arulmozhi. It was not just easy<br though she was a princess. Now her objective was to<br get arulmozhi first and then beget a son thru him. She<br is not sure of getting arulmozhi. So only after<br meeting arulmozhi she gets this fainting habit.<br Remember kundavai telling arulmozhi that vanathy was<br very much carefree and talkative when she first came<br to pazhaiyaarai from kodumbaalur.<br /><br <br Actually she is<br />mentally very strong and sternly<br follows her mind till the end. Also the sabatham which<br she does is not just for poonkuzhali or anyone. It is<br actually for arulmozhi. Because though arulmozhi knows<br that vanathy loves him, he has an iota of thought that<br may be she loves him in hope of becoming a queen. This<br thought came to arulmozhi's mind because of kundavai,<br Periya velar etc. She makes the sabatham so that<br arulmozhi can understand her true love for him. When<br kundavai asks her why has she madesuch a terrible<br vow, she replies "Rombo naatkalaaga en manathil<br theermanitha vishayathai dhaan ippodhu palar<br ariyumbadi koorinen akka". So one can see that she is<br not influenced by anyone and she can never be. Her<br sabatham is for clearing away the stumbling blocks in<br her pathway to accomplish what she wants. It is after<br this episode that arulmozhi just makes explicit his<br hidden love for her.<br <br She is very<br />stubborn also.She pays a<br />deaf ear to<br kundavai when she wants to go to nagai for arulmozhi.<br She asks for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym 's help but when he is not willing she<br decides to go all alone. These incidents are examples<br of how undeterred her mind is. Actually she proves<br her true love for arulmozhi over poonguzhali or<br anyone. Manimekalai fails to do this to <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym .<br <br Even when arulmozhi teases her so many times she just<br remains quiet. She never gets angry , she never<br argues, which means that she is sure of herself. She<br is undisturbed. She accomplishes her goals in a very<br quiet and calm manner. <br <br One more point to be noted is that after knowing her<br mind fully, arulmozhi immediately agrees to marry her.<br Kundavai doesn't come in the picture at all. Vanathy<br tells him that he should marry her before he goes to<br nagaifor political reasons for which he says okay.<br And finally he does that also. That's why they didn't<br wait for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  and others to come for<br />their<br />wedding.<br <br So arulmozhi and vanathy marry, influenced by their<br ownminds. Kundavai had nothing to do here.<br Arulmozhi's teasing of vanathy is because of his love<br for her. He never does this to any other person.<br <br We all know that when a person has no problems in his<br personal front, he can concentrate on his carrer fully<br and reach greater heights. This is one reason why<br arulmozhi chose vanathy to be his bride. He tells her<br that he has so many ambitions and he feels afraid that<br she may become hinderous in achieving his goals. <br Vanathy clears that saying that she will never be a<br stumbling block for him. And arulmozhi understands<br that vanathy knows what she wants and what arulmozhi<br wants. And so he decides to marry her. <br <br In case of poonkuzhali, her mind wavers. She is not<br sure of what she wants actually. She keeps changing<br her thoughts every now and then. Nandhini also does<br this but is totally<br />unpredictable.<br />Poonguzhali accepts<br amudhan only when she comes to know fully that she<br cannot get arulmozhi. I like poonguzhali' s character<br also. <br <br There is a saying " nam kai 5 viralkalum onna<br irukaadhu". All characters by kalki are like this.<br Each one has a different mind set, behaviour etc. But<br all are potrayed as mere humans. This is the<br highlight.<br <br Priya. <br <br <br <br <br <br ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________<br Looking for last minuteshopping deals? <br Find them fast with Yahoo!

<p>  Hi All,</p>
<p>  I think the haters of vanathy have totally<br />  misunderstood her. I request those to go thru the book<br />  again. Actually she is potrayed as being very<br />  practical unlike Poonguzhali who always dreams of so<br />  many things and accomplishes only one or two in the<br />  end and that too not in the way she dreamt of.</p>
<p>  In case of vanathy she has only two goals/ambitions or<br />  whatever you call, in her life. One is to beget a son<br />  who could avenge her father's defeat before she met<br />  arulmozhi. And after meeting arulmozhi, marrying him<br />  was the another one. Kalki has mentioned very clearly<br />  that at first she had only this thought of begetting a<br />  son who is very brave. She often dreams about her son<br />  coming to her after emerging as victorious in all the<br />  battles he fought and thus making her proud. At this<br />  stage, she is not really bothered about her husband to<br />  be. He can be any X or Y.</p>
<p>  Once she met arulmozhi she thinks that she could not<br />  accept anyone but arulmozhi as her husband. So her<br />  thought of begetting a brave son becomes complex cause<br />  now it has to be thru arulmozhi only. And now this<br />  second thought must be fullfilled , then only she can<br />  think about her first ambition. And there were many<br />  pblms in marrying arulmozhi. It was not just easy<br />  though she was a princess. Now her objective was to<br />  get arulmozhi first and then beget a son thru him. She<br />  is not sure of getting arulmozhi. So only after<br />  meeting arulmozhi she gets this fainting habit.<br />  Remember kundavai telling arulmozhi that vanathy was<br />  very much carefree and talkative when she first came<br />  to pazhaiyaarai from kodumbaalur.</p>
<p>  Actually she is mentally very strong and sternly<br />  follows her mind till the end. Also the sabatham which<br />  she does is not just for poonkuzhali or anyone. It is<br />  actually for arulmozhi. Because though arulmozhi knows<br />  that vanathy loves him, he has an iota of thought that<br />  may be she loves him in hope of becoming a queen. This<br />  thought came to arulmozhi's mind because of kundavai,<br />  Periya velar etc. She makes the sabatham so that<br />  arulmozhi can understand her true love for him. When<br />  kundavai asks her why has she made such a terrible<br />  vow, she replies "Rombo naatkalaaga en manathil<br />  theermanitha vishayathai dhaan ippodhu palar<br />  ariyumbadi koorinen akka". So one can see that she is<br />  not influenced by anyone and she can never be. Her<br />  sabatham is for clearing away the stumbling blocks in<br />  her pathway to accomplish what she wants. It is after<br />  this episode that arulmozhi just mak es explicit his<br />  hidden love for her.</p>
<p>  She is very stubborn also.She pays a deaf ear to<br />  kundavai when she wants to go to nagai for arulmozhi.<br />  She asks for vd's help but when he is not willing she<br />  decides to go all alone. These incidents are examples<br />  of how undeterred her mind is. Actually she proves<br />  her true love for arulmozhi over poonguzhali or<br />  anyone. Manimekalai fails to do this to VD.</p>
<p>  Even when arulmozhi teases her so many times she just<br />  remains quiet. She never gets angry , she never<br />  argues, which means that she is sure of herself. She<br />  is undisturbed. She accomplishes her goals in a very<br />  quiet and calm manner.</p>
<p>  One more point to be noted is that after knowing her<br />  mind fully, arulmozhi immediately agrees to marry her.<br />  Kundavai doesn't come in the picture at all. Vanathy<br />  tells him that he should marry her before he goes to<br />  nagai for political reasons for which he says okay.<br />  And finally he does that also. That's why they didn't<br />  wait for VD and others to come for their wedding.</p>
<p>  So arulmozhi and vanathy marry, influenced by their<br />  own minds. Kundavai had nothing to do here.<br />  Arulmozhi's teasing of vanathy is because of his love<br />  for her. He never does this to any other person.</p>
<p>  We all know that when a person has no problems in his<br />  personal front, he can concentrate on his carrer fully<br />  and reach greater heights. This is one reason why<br />  arulmozhi chose vanathy to be his bride. He tells her<br />  that he has so many ambitions and he feels afraid that<br />  she may become hinderous in achieving his goals.<br />  Vanathy clears that saying that she will never be a<br />  stumbling block for him. And arulmozhi understands<br />  that vanathy knows what she wants and what arulmozhi<br />  wants. And so he decides to marry her.</p>
<p>  In case of poonkuzhali, her mind wavers. She is not<br />  sure of what she wants actually. She keeps changing<br />  her thoughts every now and then. Nandhini also does<br />  this but is totally unpredictable. Poonguzhali accepts<br />  amudhan only when she comes to know fully that she<br />  cannot get arulmozhi. I like poonguzhali's character<br />  also.</p>
<p>  There is a saying " nam kai 5 viralkalum onna<br />  irukaadhu". All characters by kalki are like this.<br />  Each one has a different mind set, behaviour etc. But<br />  all are potrayed as mere humans. This is the<br />  highlight.</p>

<p>    Hi All,</p>
<p>    I think the haters of vanathy have totally<br />    misunderstood her. I request those to go thru the book<br />    again. Actually she is potrayed as being very<br />    practical unlike Poonguzhali who always dreams of so<br />    many things and accomplishes only one or two in the<br />    end and that too not in the way she dreamt of.</p>
<p>    In case of vanathy she has only two goals/ambitions or<br />    whatever you call, in her life. One is to beget a son<br />    who could avenge her father's defeat before she met<br />    arulmozhi. And after meeting arulmozhi, marrying him<br />    was the another one.

Vanathy<br />  tells him that he should marry her before he goes to<br />  nagai for political reasons for which he says okay.<br />  And finally he does that also. That's why they didn't<br />  wait for VD and others to come for their wedding.</p>
<p>  So arulmozhi and vanathy marry, influenced by their<br />  own minds. Kundavai had nothing to do here.<br />  Arulmozhi's teasing of vanathy is because of his love<br />  for her. He never does this to any other person.</p>
<p>  We all know that when a person has no problems in his<br />  personal front, he can concentrate on his carrer fully<br />  and reach greater heights. This is one reason why<br />  arulmozhi chose vanathy to be his bride. He tells her<br />  that he has so many ambitions and he feels afraid that<br />  she may become hinderous in achieving his goals. <br />  Vanathy clears that saying that she will never be a<br />  stumbling block for him. And arulmozhi understands<br />  that vanathy knows what she wants and what arulmozhi<br />  wants. And so he decides to marry her. </p>
<p>  In case of poonkuzhali, her mind wavers. She is not<br />  sure of what she wants actually. She keeps changing<br />  her thoughts every now and then. Nandhini also does<br />  this but is totally unpredictable. Poonguzhali accepts<br />  amudhan only when she comes to know fully that she<br />  cannot get arulmozhi. I like poonguzhali's character<br />  also. </p>
<p>  There is a saying " nam kai 5 viralkalum onna<br />  irukaadhu". All characters by kalki are like this.<br />  Each one has a different mind set, behaviour etc. But<br />  all are potrayed as mere humans. This is the<br />  highlight.</p>
<p>  Priya. </p>

<privj@yahoo.com  wrote:<br />Hi All,</privj@yahoo.com></p>
<p>I think the haters of vanathy have totally<br />misunderstood her. I request those to go thru the book<br />again. Actually she is potrayed as being very<br />practical unlike Poonguzhali who always dreams of so<br />many things and accomplishes only one or two in the<br />end and that too not in the way she dreamt of.</p>
<p>In case of vanathy she has only two goals/ambitions or<br />whatever you call, in her life. One is to beget a son<br />who could avenge her father's defeat before she met<br />arulmozhi. And after meeting arulmozhi, marrying him<br />was the another one. Kalki has mentioned very clearly<br />that at first she had only this thought of begetting a<br />son who is very brave. She often dreams about her son<br />coming to her after emerging as victorious in all the<br />battles he fought and thus making her proud. At this<br />stage, she is not really bothered about her husband to<br />be. He can be any X or Y.</p>
<p>Once she met arulmozhi she thinks that she could not<br />accept anyone but arulmozhi as her husband. So her<br />thought of begetting a brave son becomes complex cause<br />now it has to be thru arulmozhi only. And now this<br />second thought must be fullfilled , then only she can<br />think about her first ambition. And there were many<br />pblms in marrying arulmozhi. It was not just easy<br />though she was a princess. Now her objective was to<br />get arulmozhi first and then beget a son thru him. She<br />is not sure of getting arulmozhi. So only after<br />meeting arulmozhi she gets this fainting habit.<br />Remember kundavai telling arulmozhi that vanathy was<br />very much carefree and talkative when she first came<br />to pazhaiyaarai from kodumbaalur. </p>
<p>Actually she is mentally very strong and sternly<br />follows her mind till the end. Also the sabatham which<br />she does is not just for poonkuzhali or anyone. It is<br />actually for arulmozhi. Because though arulmozhi knows<br />that vanathy loves him, he has an iota of thought that<br />may be she loves him in hope of becoming a queen. This<br />thought came to arulmozhi's mind because of kundavai,<br />Periya velar etc. She makes the sabatham so that<br />arulmozhi can understand her true love for him. When<br />kundavai asks her why has she made such a terrible<br />vow, she replies "Rombo naatkalaaga en manathil<br />theermanitha vishayathai dhaan ippodhu palar<br />ariyumbadi koorinen akka". So one can see that she is<br />not influenced by anyone and she can never be. Her<br />sabatham is for clearing away the stumbling blocks in<br />her pathway to accomplish what she wants. It is after<br />this episode that arulmozhi just makes explicit his<br />hidden love for her.</p>
<p>She is very stubborn also.She pays a deaf ear to<br />kundavai when she wants to go to nagai for arulmozhi.<br />She asks for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym 's help but when he is not willing she<br />decides to go all alone. These incidents are examples<br />of how undeterred her mind is. Actually she proves<br />her true love for arulmozhi over poonguzhali or<br />anyone. Manimekalai fails to do this to <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym .</p>
<p>Even when arulmozhi teases her so many times she just<br />remains quiet. She never gets angry , she never<br />argues, which means that she is sure of herself. She<br />is undisturbed. She accomplishes her goals in a very<br />quiet and calm manner. </p>
<p>One more point to be noted is that after knowing her<br />mind fully, arulmozhi immediately agrees to marry her.<br />Kundavai doesn't come in the picture at all. Vanathy<br />tells him that he should marry her before he goes to<br />nagai for political reasons for which he says okay.<br />And finally he does that also. That's why they didn't<br />wait for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  and others to come for their wedding.</p>
<p>So arulmozhi and vanathy marry, influenced by their<br />own minds. Kundavai had nothing to do here.<br />Arulmozhi's teasing of vanathy is because of his love<br />for her. He never does this to any other person.</p>
<p>We all know that when a person has no problems in his<br />personal front, he can concentrate on his carrer fully<br />and reach greater heights.

He tells her<br />that he has so many ambitions and he feels afraid that<br />she may become hinderous in achieving his goals. <br />Vanathy clears that saying that she will never be a<br />stumbling block for him.

And now this<br />second thought must be fullfilled , then only she can<br />think about her first ambition. And there were many<br />pblms in marrying arulmozhi. It was not just easy<br />though she was a princess. Now her objective was to<br />get arulmozhi first and then beget a son thru him. She<br />is not sure of getting arulmozhi. So only after<br />meeting arulmozhi she gets this fainting habit.<br />Remember kundavai telling arulmozhi that vanathy was<br />very much carefree and talkative when she first came<br />to pazhaiyaarai from kodumbaalur. </p>
<p>Actually she is mentally very strong and sternly<br />follows her mind till the end. Also the sabatham which<br />she does is not just for poonkuzhali or anyone. It is<br />actually for arulmozhi. Because though arulmozhi knows<br />that vanathy loves him, he has an iota of thought that<br />may be she loves him in hope of becoming a queen. This<br />thought came to arulmozhi's mind because of kundavai,<br />Periya velar etc. She makes the sabatham so that<br />arulmozhi can understand her true love for him. When<br />kundavai asks her why has she made such a terrible<br />vow, she replies "Rombo naatkalaaga en manathil<br />theermanitha vishayathai dhaan ippodhu palar<br />ariyumbadi koorinen akka". So one can see that she is<br />not influenced by anyone and she can never be. Her<br />sabatham is for clearing away the stumbling blocks in<br />her pathway to accomplish what she wants. It is after<br />this episode that arulmozhi just makes explicit his<br />hidden love for her.</p>
<p>She is very stubborn also.She pays a deaf ear to<br />kundavai when she wants to go to nagai for arulmozhi.<br />She asks for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym 's help but when he is not willing she<br />decides to go all alone. These incidents are examples<br />of how undeterred her mind is. Actually she proves<br />her true love for arulmozhi over poonguzhali or<br />anyone. Manimekalai fails to do this to <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym .</p>
<p>Even when arulmozhi teases her so many times she just<br />remains quiet. She never gets angry , she never<br />argues, which means that she is sure of herself. She<br />is undisturbed. She accomplishes her goals in a very<br />quiet and calm manner. </p>
<p>One more point to be noted is that after knowing her<br />mind fully, arulmozhi immediately agrees to marry her.<br />Kundavai doesn't come in the picture at all. Vanathy<br />tells him that he should marry her before he goes to<br />nagai for political reasons for which he says okay.<br />And finally he does that also. That's why they didn't<br />wait for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  and others to come for their wedding.</p>
<p>So arulmozhi and vanathy marry, influenced by their<br />own minds. Kundavai had nothing to do here.<br />Arulmozhi's teasing of vanathy is because of his love<br />for her. He never does this to any other person.</p>
<p>We all know that when a person has no problems in his<br />personal front, he can concentrate on his carrer fully<br />and reach greater heights. This is one reason why<br />arulmozhi chose vanathy to be his bride. He tells her<br />that he has so many ambitions and he feels afraid that<br />she may become hinderous in achieving his goals. <br />Vanathy clears that saying that she will never be a<br />stumbling block for him. And arulmozhi understands<br />that vanathy knows what she wants and what arulmozhi<br />wants. And so he decides to marry her. </p>
<p>In case of poonkuzhali, her mind wavers. She is not<br />sure of what she wants actually. She keeps changing<br />her thoughts every now and then. Nandhini also does<br />this but is totally unpredictable. Poonguzhali accepts<br />amudhan only when she comes to know fully that she<br />cannot get arulmozhi. I like poonguzhali's character<br />also. </p>
<p>There is a saying " nam kai 5 viralkalum onna<br />irukaadhu". All characters by kalki are like this.<br />Each one has a different mind set, behaviour etc. But<br />all are potrayed as mere humans. This is the<br />highlight.</p>
<p>Priya. </p>

<p>Ravindran <mprakas@...  wrote:  Hmm..somebody has to take up the <br />defense of Vanathy  again..  I think she probably is the most mis-<br />understood  heroine based on the comments passed so far.   Vanathy <br />can be characterized as a muse to Arulmozhi,  he says so at the very <br />end. To say that Arunmozhi  married Vanathy for the sake of Kundavai <br />is  disingenous. Arunmozhi confesses this to VT that if  there is <br />someone who can disturb him, it is her. He  can talk in equal terms <br />with Poonkuzhali, match  Nanthini's wits, but cannot bear to see her <br />suffer.  Remember the dropping the arathi incident and what  <br />Arunmozhi tells Kundavai.   Love is such a complex feeling, only a <br />person who  experiences it can actually comprehend it. I sent a  mail <br />long back comparing Vanathy to Ophelia in  Hamlet.  Both are just <br />consummed by their love and there is  nothing else that matters to <br />them. Ophelia actually  gets drown in the brook and dies because of <br />the  altercation with Hamlet. Nothing matters because  their  love is <br />the only thing that leaves them breathing.   Call it insipid,sombu-<br />thooki or what not. Except  Manimegalai or may be Oomai rani, every <br />other love  in  PS is based either on the conveniance of it or  <br />because  its practical. Kundavai loves VT because it makes  sure  she <br />does not leave chola nadu. Nandhini, we all know  what she was after. <br />Poonkuzhali loves the chola  throne  and marries the guy who inherits <br />it. Nothing comes  nearer to the love which Vanathy bears for <br />Arunmozhi  and I do not think any one else would have made  Arunmozhi <br />happier in the entire novel.     Lastly, the most favorite chapter in <br />the entire PS  for  me is the 'Yaanai Paaga! Yaanai Paaga!'. This is <br />a  chapter that is full of playful dialogues and the  kind  of <br />flirting that is a treat to read. I suggest you  read this chapter a <br />little more closely.

<p>//PS - I named my daughter 'Vanathy' but she is<br />growing<br />up more like a Poonkuzhali! !!//</p>
<p>Good father, a better daughter!</p>
<p>--- Muthu Prakash Ravindran <mprakas@yahoo.com  wrote:</p></mprakas@yahoo.com></p>
<blockquote><p>  Hmm..somebody has to take up the defense of Vanathy<br />  again..<br />  I think she probably is the most mis-understood<br />  heroine based on the comments passed so far. <br />  Vanathy can be characterized as a muse to Arulmozhi,<br />  he says so at the very end. To say that Arunmozhi<br />  married Vanathy for the sake of Kundavai is<br />  disingenous. Arunmozhi confesses this to VT that if<br />  there is someone who can disturb him, it is her. He<br />  can talk in equal terms with Poonkuzhali, match<br />  Nanthini's wits, but cannot bear to see her suffer.<br />  Remember the dropping the arathi incident and what<br />  Arunmozhi tells Kundavai. <br />  Love is such a complex feeling, only a person who<br />  experiences it can actually comprehend it. I sent a<br />  mail long back comparing Vanathy to Ophelia in<br />  Hamlet.<br />  Both are just consummed by their love and there is<br />  nothing else that matters to them. Ophelia actually<br />  gets drown in the brook and dies because of the<br />  altercation with Hamlet. Nothing matters because<br />  their<br />  love is the only thing that leaves them breathing. <br />  Call it insipid,sombu-thooki or what not. Except<br />  Manimegalai or may be Oomai rani, every other love<br />  in<br />  PS is based either on the conveniance of it or<br />  because<br />  its practical. Kundavai loves VT because it makes<br />  sure<br />  she does not leave chola nadu. Nandhini, we all know<br />  what she was after. Poonkuzhali loves the chola<br />  throne<br />  and marries the guy who inherits it. Nothing comes<br />  nearer to the love which Vanathy bears for Arunmozhi<br />  and I do not think any one else would have made<br />  Arunmozhi happier in the entire novel. </p>
<p>  Lastly, the most favorite chapter in the entire PS<br />  for<br />  me is the 'Yaanai Paaga! Yaanai Paaga!'. This is a<br />  chapter that is full of playful dialogues and the<br />  kind<br />  of flirting that is a treat to read. I suggest you<br />  read this chapter a little more closely.</p>

        <p>SPS,</p>
<p>I think you are mixing up two different events. July 24th weekend <br />trip was one of the very few trips I made and Pavithra was not part <br />of that. i think she joined us only at Sangeetha. And I dont <br />remember we all visiting the shore temple at night, because it was <br />almost 10 when we reached Mamallai and visited the Shore temple only <br />in the morning. YOu might be referring to another trip of yours with <br />them.</p>
<p>And that was when Kamal coined the name for you 'weekend vishnu'. :)<br />meaning during weekend, you can be found everywhere.<br />Saturday evening you came all the way from chennai and joined us at <br />Uthiramerur and again left back to chennai. and agian the next <br />morning you came to Mamallai again vanished and we found you again <br />at hotel Sangeetha in the afternoon. That was the third or fourth <br />time I met you and was shocked to see your stamina and switness in <br />travelling.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, in the next few months, September 3rd, we also experienced <br />your driving.. cant forget Venkat chanting 'kakka kakka kanagavel <br />kakka' from the rear seat of your Qualis :) around 12.30AM from <br />Madurantakam to Chennai...</p>

        <p>One of Poonguzhali's suitors left out- Pinakapani !</p>
<p>Giving up the Throne is one thing, but for every living being life is the most precious,(the lion is ready to be saved by a mouse). This girl is risking even her life, for what cause? not even as a sacrifice but just 'cos of her dislike for Poonguzhali.</p>
<p>She sticks to her sabatham yes, but again it is giving up her rightful place as Patta Magishi<br />just to defy a boatgirl whose comments should not even matter to her if she had any maturity that a future queen to be should have. She should have been proud of the fact that she is sure to win Arulmozhi &amp; seen through Poonguzhali's jealousy.</p>
<p>Anyway I think we've had too much of Vanathi, shd. take up other threads.<br />Shobha</p>

        <p>Docile is such a subjective term. I dont think she is docile. Take <br />the case of Kundavai trying to changing her mind abt inheriting the <br />throne. Vanathy refuses to entertain and stick to her sabatham. Also <br />in the end when she actually saves <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  from the flood. Or the 14th <br />chapter (another fav of mine) when our hero <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  throws his veera vel <br />into a dummy croc. Vananthy approaches the croc without fear and <br />says she is afraid only of roaches. But then we all have our fears. </acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Insipid. We all have our prejudices and calling her stupid because <br />of not allowing Poonkuzhali might be one. In fact,, will you call <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  a stupid for refusing to ascend the throne because that would <br />have given another 15 years of his golden rule to the Cholas? <br />By the same yard stick, everyone in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  makes their choices and <br />refuse something or other. That doesn't make them insipid either.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>This comparison reminds me of another great romance 'Ivan Hoe' and <br />the actual rivalry between Rowena and Rebecca. Rebecca is the one <br />with all the handicaps (a jew, poor etc) and is almost like <br />Poonkuzhali. Whereas Rowena is a saxon princess and hopelessly <br />romantic like Vanathy. Guess who marries Ivan Hoe.</p>
<p>But that aside, Vanathy remains one of the most romantic female <br />character created by Kalki. On the same terms, Poonkuzhali might be <br />the strongest, Nandhini the complex one.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Good to hear your daughter is growing up like Poonguzhali, that is <br />more with the times.</p>

<p>princess from a family of warriors. I can understand a commoner <br />being docile, fearful etc. but a princess (nevertheless from a <br />chitrarasu) &amp; one so closely associated with Kundavai, how can she <br />be so insipid? Even her refusing to be rescued by Poonguzhali was a <br />foolish act. Poonguzhali was far from her equal for Vanathi to have <br />a rivalry, which is normally among equals.</p>
<blockquote><p>  As for the arathi incident, Arulmozhi would have reacted the <br />same way had it been anyone other than Vanathi there.<br />  May be Kundavai madiri oru nathanar kitta adangi poradhukkagave <br />appidi irudhalo?<br />  Muthu Prakash Ravindran <mprakas@...  wrote:<br />  Hmm..somebody has to take up the defense of Vanathy<br />  again..<br />  I think she probably is the most mis-understood<br />  heroine based on the comments passed so far. <br />  Vanathy can be characterized as a muse to Arulmozhi,<br />  he says so at the very end. To say that Arunmozhi<br />  married Vanathy for the sake of Kundavai is<br />  disingenous. Arunmozhi confesses this to VT that if<br />  there is someone who can disturb him, it is her. He<br />  can talk in equal terms with Poonkuzhali, match<br />  Nanthini's wits, but cannot bear to see her suffer.<br />  Remember the dropping the arathi incident and what<br />  Arunmozhi tells Kundavai. <br />  Love is such a complex feeling, only a person who<br />  experiences it can actually comprehend it. I sent a<br />  mail long back comparing Vanathy to Ophelia in Hamlet.<br />  Both are just consummed by their love and there is<br />  nothing else that matters to them. Ophelia actually<br />  gets drown in the brook and dies because of the<br />  altercation with Hamlet. Nothing matters because their<br />  love is the only thing that leaves them breathing. <br />  Call it insipid,sombu-thooki or what not. Except<br />  Manimegalai or may be Oomai rani, every other love in<br />  PS is based either on the conveniance of it or because<br />  its practical. Kundavai loves VT because it makes sure<br />  she does not leave chola nadu. Nandhini, we all know<br />  what she was after. Poonkuzhali loves the chola throne<br />  and marries the guy who inherits it. Nothing comes<br />  nearer to the love which Vanathy bears for Arunmozhi<br />  and I do not think any one else would have made<br />  Arunmozhi happier in the entire novel. </mprakas@...></p>
<p>  Lastly, the most favorite chapter in the entire PS for<br />  me is the 'Yaanai Paaga! Yaanai Paaga!'. This is a<br />  chapter that is full of playful dialogues and the kind<br />  of flirting that is a treat to read. I suggest you<br />  read this chapter a little more closely.</p>

<p>  PS - I named my daughter 'Vanathy' but she is growing<br />  up more like a Poonkuzhali!!!</p>

        <p>Good to hear your daughter is growing up like Poonguzhali, that is more with the times.</p>
<p>I have not commented or criticised Vanathi's love for Arulmozhi. Even I like the Yaanaipaga chapter, but after all she ia also a princess from a family of warriors. I can understand a commoner being docile, fearful etc. but a princess (nevertheless from a chitrarasu) &amp; one so closely associated with Kundavai, how can she be so insipid? Even her refusing to be rescued by Poonguzhali was a foolish act. Poonguzhali was far from her equal for Vanathi to have a rivalry, which is normally among equals.<br />As for the arathi incident, Arulmozhi would have reacted the same way had it been anyone other than Vanathi there.<br />May be Kundavai madiri oru nathanar kitta adangi poradhukkagave appidi irudhalo?<br />Muthu Prakash Ravindran <mprakas@yahoo.com  wrote:<br />Hmm..somebody has to take up the defense of Vanathy<br />again..<br />I think she probably is the most mis-understood<br />heroine based on the comments passed so far. <br />Vanathy can be characterized as a muse to Arulmozhi,<br />he says so at the very end. To say that Arunmozhi<br />married Vanathy for the sake of Kundavai is<br />disingenous. Arunmozhi confesses this to <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  that if<br />there is someone who can disturb him, it is her. He<br />can talk in equal terms with Poonkuzhali, match<br />Nanthini's wits, but cannot bear to see her suffer.<br />Remember the dropping the arathi incident and what<br />Arunmozhi tells Kundavai. <br />Love is such a complex feeling, only a person who<br />experiences it can actually comprehend it. I sent a<br />mail long back comparing Vanathy to Ophelia in Hamlet.<br />Both are just consummed by their love and there is<br />nothing else that matters to them. Ophelia actually<br />gets drown in the brook and dies because of the<br />altercation with Hamlet. Nothing matters because their<br />love is the only thing that leaves them breathing. <br />Call it insipid,sombu-thooki or what not. Except<br />Manimegalai or may be Oomai rani, every other love in<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is based either on the conveniance of it or because<br />its practical. Kundavai loves <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  because it makes sure<br />she does not leave chola nadu. Nandhini, we all know<br />what she was after. Poonkuzhali loves the chola throne<br />and marries the guy who inherits it. Nothing comes<br />nearer to the love which Vanathy bears for Arunmozhi<br />and I do not think any one else would have made<br />Arunmozhi happier in the entire novel. </acronym></acronym></acronym></mprakas@yahoo.com></p>
<p>Lastly, the most favorite chapter in the entire <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  for<br />me is the 'Yaanai Paaga! Yaanai Paaga!'. This is a<br />chapter that is full of playful dialogues and the kind<br />of flirting that is a treat to read. I suggest you<br />read this chapter a little more closely.</acronym></p>

<p>True . very true. at that point arul mozhi was as faraway from <br />inheriting the throne as you and me.<br />an uncle and an elder brother waiting before him.</p>
<p>vanathy like manimekalai loved a person. not what the person owned or <br />was.<br />but then nandini loved aaditya before she got into the pandya freedom <br />movement too.<br />perhaps it was that wrecked love that made her so vicious.</p>

<p>Hmm..somebody has to take up the defense of Vanathy<br />again..<br />I think she probably is the most mis-understood<br />heroine based on the comments passed so far. <br />Vanathy can be characterized as a muse to Arulmozhi,<br />he says so at the very end. To say that Arunmozhi<br />married Vanathy for the sake of Kundavai is<br />disingenous. Arunmozhi confesses this to <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  that if<br />there is someone who can disturb him, it is her. He<br />can talk in equal terms with Poonkuzhali, match<br />Nanthini's wits, but cannot bear to see her suffer.<br />Remember the dropping the arathi incident and what<br />Arunmozhi tells Kundavai. <br />Love is such a complex feeling, only a person who<br />experiences it can actually comprehend it. I sent a<br />mail long back comparing Vanathy to Ophelia in Hamlet.<br />Both are just consummed by their love and there is<br />nothing else that matters to them. Ophelia actually<br />gets drown in the brook and dies because of the<br />altercation with Hamlet. Nothing matters because their<br />love is the only thing that leaves them breathing. <br />Call it insipid,sombu-thooki or what not. Except<br />Manimegalai or may be Oomai rani, every other love in<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is based either on the conveniance of it or because<br />its practical. Kundavai loves <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  because it makes sure<br />she does not leave chola nadu. Nandhini, we all know<br />what she was after. Poonkuzhali loves the chola throne<br />and marries the guy who inherits it. Nothing comes<br />nearer to the love which Vanathy bears for Arunmozhi<br />and I do not think any one else would have made<br />Arunmozhi happier in the entire novel. </acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Lastly, the most favorite chapter in the entire <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  for<br />me is the 'Yaanai Paaga! Yaanai Paaga!'. This is a<br />chapter that is full of playful dialogues and the kind<br />of flirting that is a treat to read. I suggest you<br />read this chapter a little more closely.</acronym></p>

<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  - I named my daughter 'Vanathy' but she is growing<br />up more like a Poonkuzhali!!!</acronym></p>

        <p>Hi <br />you may be right.<br />aggressive women dont reach the winning post always.<br />but then i think kalki went out of the way to make all his heroines <br />different</p>
<p>primary quality of his heroines</p>
<p>nandini- secretiveness<br />kundavai- ambition in a man's world<br />vanathi docility<br />pungkuzhali- quixotic<br />manimekalai- innocence.</p>
<p>but then all of them are stubborn women if you notice.<br />manimekalai stands up to her father. vanathi refuses to be saved from <br />drowning by her rival, kunthavai nandini ketkavE vendaam. pungkuzhali <br />is the limit.</p>
<p>intha ratela pona I think only sembian madevi will come out as the <br />winner.</p>

My observation -- In the long run, in real <br />life is<br />  that docile (Thats not the correct word) can I use calm women <br />achieve more<br />  in life than people like Kundhavi / Poonguzhali.</p>
