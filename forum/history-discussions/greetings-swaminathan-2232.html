<p>Subramanian Swaminathan <sswami99@gmail.com  wrote:</p>
<p>Dear friends</p>
<p>I went on an off-beat tour with my grandson this summer. I thought of inflicting you with my impression of the tour. When you have nothing else to do, please go through. If the contents merit a reply please do. It would give me great pleasure. If you choose not to go through, I can assure you, you will be losing nothing. </p>
<p>Dear</p>
<p>Swaminathan</p>
<p>Siddhrath, my grandson was visiting us this summer. He, like most of his generation, is very allergic to be taken to an endless line of temples. In fact this is the impression many people have, that we have none other than temples to show to the tourists. But I feel that Tamilnadu offers hell of a lot; but we don't bother to know. During my concentrated attention of Pudukkottai &#150; attempting to document its heritage &#150; I once went to Mailappatti, a mere 10 km from Pudukkottai town. Here is a dilapidated Jain temple. But the place offers some thing very interesting. The whole area is striking, a number of low hills, a few ponds here and there, barren land (which is attractive on its own) broken by verdant agricultural fields, clean air, very sof music of gentle breeze, no litter except by the cattle. You may see some people here and there. But more or less free from civilisational activity. One may find this place fit for contemplation; or for a 'fantastic' picnic depending on your<br />temperament. </p>
<p>My own idea of compiling a cultural atlas of Tamilnadu comes out of my conviction that the Tamilnadu terrain offers a wide variety of sites to suit individuals tastes. So for Siddhu I was searching for a few sites appropriate to his age and background. Here is the shortlist. </p>
<p>1. Ariyalur Fossil park:</p>
<p>Close to Ariyalur is a land of fossils. Most of us don't know. </p>
<p>About 100 million years ago Bay of Bengal inundated over 350 square miles of land on the Padalur-Ariyalur region of Perambalur district, am area where the giant dinosaurs sauntered majestically. This is one of the three sites on earth where the rare phenomenon of sea-ingression and regression had taken place. The sea then known as the Gondwana sea (this is from the popular literature. I have heard of Gondwana land; was there a gondwana sea too) had inundated the area covering the present five towns of Samayapuram, Kumulur, Pullambadi, Dalmiapuram, Keezhaipalur, V. Kaikatti, Sendurai, Kunnam, Kaarai and Kolakkalnatham about 100 millions years ago, disappeared within a short time due to the movement of the earth's crust or after being hit by a comet or meteor. </p>
<p>Billions of sea creatures like clams, oysters, molluscs, corals, which perished during the withdrawal of the sea resulted in the compression and formation of some of the finest deposits of limestone in the country. In the past eggs of dinosaurs have been found. A few can be seen in the museum here. </p>
<p>The 18-meter-long fossil tree, over 100 million years old at Sathanur, is about 20 km from Ariyalur. </p>
<p>Now that six giant cement factories are now using as much as 50,000 tonnes of limestone daily from the region, and they may actually be crushing these fossils is another matter. </p>
<p>2. Architecture of Chettinad</p>
<p>Shekhavati Havelis of Rajasthan are great tourist attractions. But our own mansions of Nattukottai Chettiars, though no less, are hardly known to tourists. They were built in a glorious 100-year period, between the 1840s and the 1940s. A few are still well maintained, many are ghostly shells, others are derelict and still others are in ruins. Have you heard of 1000-window house? Go to Chettinad. For me it is also nostalgic. Pudukkottai is the entry point to Chettinad. </p>
<p>Karaikkudi is jotted with shops which sell antique shops, selling the items from the pulled down houses. The 'palace' of the Raja of Chettinad in Kanadukathan is maintained as a museum. </p>
<p>3. Longwood Shola on the Western Ghats</p>
<p>A visit to this shola (actually corruption of Solai in Tamil, a Tamil contribution to the English language) is to have a first hand impression of an awareness campaign, Save the Western Ghats Youth Network, protected by the local communities who are aware that if not for this forest they would be faced with water scarcity. </p>
<p>The evergreen trees of the tropical forest never shed their leaves, and unlike other forest trees form a thick canopy not permitting the sun's rays to penetrate the foliage. The 116-hectare forest area provides drinking water to more than 25 villages including Kerbetta, Aravenu and Jackanari even in the summer months when water is scarce. </p>
<p>The soil is rich, the ground orchids are in bloom, the jungle fowls, Nilgiri laughing thrush, munia, babbler and golden backed wood peckers orchestrate the background music punctuated by the calls of the barking deer. The forest also boasts of indigenous plants with medicinal properties. </p>
<p>4. Our ancestors' canvas in the Western Ghats &#150; The Prehistoric paintings</p>
<p>There are a few sites of archaeological importance in and around Kotagiri. In the forests close to Porivarai, a village about 40 kilometres from Kotagiri. </p>
<p>On a huge rock, roughly 300 feet high and 500 feet long, with paintings found on its eastern face, one of the longest pre-historical rock art sites &#150; 53 metres in length and about 15 metres high. There are more than 500 images, but the elements have eroded a few. The subjects range from animal to human figures &#151; a series on bulls and bull-fighting, the domestication of wild animals, deer, elephants, domestic fowl, a man riding an animal, a man carrying animals, monkeys, a mongoose and a snake fight and warriors with weapons. </p>
<p>Here is another Bimbetka! Are we aware of this?</p>
<p>5. Stone Age sculpture at Poondi</p>
<p>About this park near Chennai, Anjali Sircar in The Hindu, writes that the past is always part of the present and that it lives on through art. </p>
<p>It is not very far from Chennai. A 90-kilometre drive from Chennai to Gudiyam village past Poondi brings you to an inaccessible forest of evergreen and deciduous trees, and just five kilometres in this dense region lies the largest Palaeolithic or Stone Age cave of Tamil Nadu, first discovered by Robert Bruce Foote in 1863, Robert Bruce Foote, a British geologist. The discovery, small but momentous, opened up an entire new area of research about the Palaeolithic Age in the Tamil Nadu region, and pushed back the antiquity of the Tamil man by 1,00,000 years. </p>
<p>Foote was joined by his colleague William King in this daunting task of exploring the environs surrounding Madras. They located numerous Palaeolithic sites such as Poondi, Gudiyam and Attrambakkam, among others, in the Chingleput and North Arcot districts of northern Tamil Nadu. The Department of Archaeology, Tamil Nadu, had set up a museum at Poondi displaying some of the prehistoric finds from different parts of Tamil Nadu, and a sculpture park within the campus of the Poondi Museum. There is a replica of the Palaeolithic cave and the early hominid and Palaeolithic stone implements.</p>
<p>Wouldn't this interest us! It would definitely the 12-year old boy, I am certain. </p>
<p>6. Shakuntala Jagannathan Museum of Folk Art at Kanchi</p>
<p>My ancestral home in Pudukkottai was pulled down to house a modern building after it provided a home for more than 150 years. (No building has yet come come up is hardly a consolation.) How many would remember every nook-and-corner of this nothing-special-about-it house! But it was special to a hundred people, like me. </p>
<p>CP Ramaswamy Iyer, unlike my father, was a very famous man. His family is illustrious. They have taken pains to maintain their house in Kanchipuram as a museum. What better lesson I can give my grandson in conservation than taking him to this museum, in a land every thing old allowed to decay (this includes even human being these days). </p>
<p>Called the Shakuntala Jagannathan Museum of Folk Art, after the lady because few people in India were more committed to showcasing India's cultural heritage to travellers from all over the world than Shakuntala Jagannathan, the eldest grand-daughter of Sir CP. This 400-year-old home, Brahma Mandiram, offers a glimpse of a bygone age. </p>
<p>Together, the rooms of Brahma Mandiram give the visitor a glimpse of what life was like in ancient Kanchi, which, in the 4th Century, was described as "the greatest of all cities on this earth". One of the seven sacred cities of India, the capital of ancient Tondaimandalam and the Pallavas, and described as "the most ancient city of South India", Kanchi was known in the 2nd Century B.C. as one of the greatest centres of learning in the ancient world. Heritage homes like this museum are a reflection of that learning. But there are also times what that learning is not reflected. </p>
<p>Though we looked at all these we settled down to two separate trips offering some variety. </p>
<p>Our Trip</p>
<p>Kurusadai, near Rameswaram, is an island and a bioreserve with coral reefs nearby, and the ghost town of Dhanushkodi, swallowed by sea 40 years ago became our first leg. The attachment &#150; a low-key one to Siddhu - would be the mighty Rameswaram temple. </p>
<p>The train to Rameswaram would be a dream came true for Siddhu. For it was a metre gauge train, taking 18 hrs to cover about 550 km. Siddhu must be feeling completely at home in an ancient land. Whether he enjoyed or not is another matter. My friend KTR has made arrangements for our stay in a government guest house. </p>
<p>The trip to the seashore and the one to the sea-swallowed Dhanushkodi was an experience: the bone-shaking truck travel the few buildings still standing mute, a few fishermen still surviving (on what?), a glance at the direction in which Srilanka is only a few km away, etc. </p>
<p>But as usual information about every thing was lacking. First there is no way to know what happened in 1964, except that from the truck driver with more of his masala rarely tinged with facts. There are no sign boards to identify the buildings of yore. We saw a church, the railway station and a few roof-lost buildings. The terrain is harsh. Just imagine the past, a flourishing town. This is the place from which boats for Srilanka left; and the train from Madras (it passed through Pudukkottai) was called Boat Mail. To travel by Boat Mail was a great excitement in my childhood.</p>
<p>I need to talk about the truck that took us into Dhanushkodi. It was a rundown 4-wheel drive. The driver said he charges Rs 30 per person and he would normally take 30 people. There was another family from Delhi. We hired the truck and paid a lump sum. Even for the 7 people it was an extremely uncomfortable ride. But I wonder how 30 people could be packed in it. Unless they are cattle taken from Tamilnadu to Kerala for slaughter! But it was an interesting experience. </p>
<p>The next day we went to Mandapam and went by boat to Kurusadai island, 8 km away. The island is under the Forest Department and is being guarded along with a few others as a bio-reserve forest. Though there was nothing spectacular about the flora in the island (we found at the time of our visit no fauna) the sea-shore was marvellous. Totally bereft of humans, it had grandeur of its own. We saw quite a few sea weeds. We collected some shells. There was one sea-animal (or a sea-weed) worth mentioning. We found a number of them very close to the shore. They all looked like giant mushroom, dull olive colour. My wife just touched one of them out of curiosity. Lo and behold! It just folded and in a few seconds there was no trace of it. My guide explained it was a sea animal, whose bottom could be two to three feet below, and difficult to pull out. I would like to find out more about it. </p>
<p>On the other side is the area, again a reserved area, for coral reefs. Commercial boats with glass bottom ply. We could see a lot of corals, some of very bright colours and some very large. </p>
<p>There was one item which interested Siddhu. On the coral reef side was an activity of PEPSI. They were growing a sea-weed on a commercial basis, a weed, which forms an ingredient in their famous soft drink. We could see the rafters floating all over the place, and the 'farmers', a man-wife team, hauling up one such harvest, and spread on the rocks the drying of the weed. </p>
<p>The visit to the temple was good, for Siddhu could see the massive size of the temple. He asked me a number of questions &#150; interesting to him, embarrassing to us. We didn't want to take him through the long ambulation around the prakaram. But when he a look at the colonnade, he himself suggested going round! </p>
<p>For our next leg we chose three sites: Thiruvikkarai, a fossil park and Kilvalai where there are rock paintings of the pre-historic times. These both are close to Pondicherry, because of which Pondicherry was include, which by itself offers something different.<br />In order to provide some youthful company to Siddhu we took Udhaya, grand-daughter of my brother, working for PhD at <acronym title="Indian Instittue of Technology" IIT</acronym  Madras. It was very difficult to get information on the fossil park and also correct direction to reach the place. You will have to wait for the publication of my cultural atlas of Tamilnadu! Only my collection could throw some light on them. Thiruvakkarai is about 25 kilometers south east of Tindivanam. We took at least one wrong turn. I am certain that there will be a direction sign put up by the government. I was telling the driver to look for an old dilapidated, undecipherable large board of rather odd size. Yes there was one which was put up at the place where we were to take the side road. The same routine as we find elsewhere. There were a number of road branches without any clue which to take. As usual no one around to guide us. After a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of meandering we reached the gate of the Park. As usual it was locked. We didn't know what we should do. As usual, a<br />little girl (10-year old) appeared from nowhere carrying a small fossil for sale. She has all the information that we needed: the keeper resides yonder in that house; he will be coming at 9-30. As usual she wanted us to buy the fossil from her. What was unusual was that she wanted money to buy a pen! Prompt at 9-30 came the keeper, a very friendly person. He must be bored. For very rarely people visit. How people can visit when the existence of such an important place is kept secret from the public? He showed us around. It is not a vast area. One may not take any more than 45 minutes. There is board which gives some information, but as usual user-unfriendly! Some jargon, some irrelevant material, badly composed, clumsily written. Curiously, these boards are shown in the Pondicherry tourism website, but the contents cannot read! Why then did they take the trouble?<br />We walked along the meandering and narrow path through this petrified forest, trunks of various shapes lie strewn and half-buried in the soil. They are brown, look very much like wood but are as hard as rock. Some of the fossils have annular rings that reveal their age at the time of their death. </acronym></p>
<p>Here is what I gathered. This non-descript, quiet, seemingly boring village hides within it a great treasure. The earliest account (1781) of these Fossil woods is by Mr. Sonneret, A European Naturalist who toured the East. As usual let us start with mythology. (Isn't India a great myth?) People believe that the pieces what you call fossils are really the severed limbs of a hideous demon killed by Varadaraja Perumal, whose temple exists in the village. And what perfect limbs they were too. Circular, with muscles rippling, perfect cuts, and hard as rock. </p>
<p>Now for non-believers. They are petrified (fossilized) tree trunks that date back at-least 20 million years. The wood fossils are spread over 247 acres in nine separate enclaves around Thiruvakkarai. The portion fenced off and formally open to the public is relatively small. </p>
<p>These petrified trees are Gymnosperms. (I find so on the board too. But how many people can understand what this would mean?) They had been felled in some remote past, ferried across to the current location and left to be turned into rocks. What for, heaaven knows! That a little village - village of no more than 10 houses, a temple and two roads - could contain such a great archaeological wonder is in itself great. </p>
<p>Some of these fossilised tree trunks are more than 30 m long and 1.5.m in diameter as the Fossil woods are devoid of Bark, Roots or Branches. The tree trunks have been completely altered and the organic matter has been replaced by Silica. No evidences of having been transported since fossilisation are seen and as such they are of the same age as the rocks in which they are preserved. The formations are known geologically as 'Cuddalore Series'. </p>
<p>The main flora indicated are ANGIOSPERMS and TAMARINDUS, the later should mean tree of the Tamarind family. </p>
<p>We may speculate the reason for the trees being brought here. Were they carried away by some ferocious storm, or felled by dinosaurs on rampage, till time deposits layers upon layers of sand and dirt and rock, slowly undergoing a transformation, strange chemicals seeping into their skins, turning them slowly, but surely into the very rock they lie on, to be discovered 10 millions years or so later, by an unsuspecting villager? </p>
<p>We thoroughly enjoyed the trip; it was worth the trouble, richer with experience and with a memento of a small piece of fossil bought from the girl for a paltry Rs 20. </p>
<p>Pondicherry offers a French ambience, tourist literature says. Except for the hat of the policemen and for the old name board proclaiming a 'rue', rather than a 'road', we may not find much of French-ness in the city. But the city is clean and compact with road intersecting at right angles. Ambling through the botanical garden was pleasant. As usual they have the names of the trees given in Tamil, English and botonical. Will names be sufficient to appreciate the grandeur of these trees? I wanted it differently in Sudharsanam, the&#150;project-would-have-been, really user-friendly! </p>
<p>The beach at the time of our visit &#150; 5 pm - was stuffy. But sea is a great sight any time! Then there was the customary visit to the Ashram. All such visits are very painful to me. Aurobindo is a cult for his followers. And the Mother. The stern board, instructing us in graceless language, don't speak high of the person who helped us to appreciate art in India. The samadhi is gloomy. The lady supervising the 'peace' of the Samadhi reminds me of the monitor on my school days. The book shop is crowded. I am happy so many people buy books. But I don't know what they make out of them. But the d?cor is rather funny with a lot of incongruous items, most of them forgettable, and I had forgotten. When are we going to learn breathing the spirit of Aurobindo on these matters? Siddhu showed no great interest in the Ashram. He could not be made to sit for a minute at the Samadhi. </p>
<p>The evening was again a customary visit to Auroville, an international community for world peace inspired by Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. I had visited the place two times before. The community there is doing excellent experiments on many aspects of sustainable living. Its work on sustainable agriculture is impressive. But the group that was in may not be interested in these idiosyncrasies of mine. But the great tower &#150; I forget what it is called by auroville-ites - is a great tourist attraction. </p>
<p>It is rather a circuitous route to reach the place. As usual quite a few forbidding posters at the entrance; as usual forbidding uniformed sentries, always suspecting all of us for pilferers and vagabonds. You need to go to some first floor for getting a free pass. Every one should go, including old and infirm. To the question, is there anything else there other than the pass-counter, no clear answer. But you can see &#150; and smell &#150; cafeteria and another building. The 'other' building houses an exhibition of the Auroville tower. (What is its name, I forget.) You need to go through this to reach the first floor where you need to go to get passes. Typical of these fancy, very expensive low-cost house, you need to do a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of search to find the staircase. A sombre lady first enquires how may we are. I made a mistake, for I had included Srinivas our driver. But my number did not tally with the people before her. In the meantime Siddhu had runaway to a corner towards whatever<br />interested him. Again calling him for the parade before the lady and a ten-minute video programme got us the passes. When we came down we were asked to wait at a place for a battery car to take us. We are told that the battery operated car is environment-friendly, and the Auroville residents are friends of environment. But Siddhu was quick to react characteristic to his generation: but batteries will have to be charged, unless they were done using solar energy? They are simply shifting the location of pollution from this highly wooded place to some place which is already highly polluted. I have no answer. The charging would not have been through sun, for the twin blocks &#150; the cafeteria-exhibition &#150; were connected to normal supply. In most of these attempting, we should accept, that we are fooling ourselves! </acronym></p>
<p>The ride took us to the unfinished 'tower' (or globe, I forget.). Has it been under-construction for long? When I came here eight years ago, it was under construction. If this takes so much time how much time will it take to 'build' the sustainable society? As it was under construction we were stopped well ahead, only to savour and receive the radiation of the universal spirit from a distance. </p>
<p>I have a great fascination for plants. This place is well wooded. But let me say something. There was a lot of artificiality. A few scores of pots of some exotic grass hanging in an orderly fashion are acceptable only in the nouveau-rich farm houses in Delhi. The lawns, of exotic grass, being watered all the 24 hours is another eye-sore. The amphitheatre is a stone jungle. The 'stupa' at the centre is a monstrosity. How many programmes would be conducted in a year to justify this kind of vandalism of nature? The 'tower' consists of a few hundred dishes of monstrous proportion. They looked gold-plated. (Are they gold, thatha, Siddhu asked; I said I don't know. May they are! Are they not attempting to usher in a golden age!) But what are they for? How do they, including the great tower, fit into the framework of living with nature? I leave all such 'sour' (puLichchu-p-pOna) ideas behind to return. </p>
<p>We left Pondicherry early morning for Kilvalai, the location of pre-historic rock paintings. While I was looking for off-beat places for Siddhu, I had short-listed this place. There were a few clippings on Kilvalai in my collection. One is by S. Muthaiah lamenting on the condition of such important places. I have a book on rock paintings of Tamilnadu by Poundurai. The book gives you enough information to get an overview of rock paintings of Tamilnadu in general, and also of Kilvalai in particular. But exact location, how to reach the place and how to locate the paintings were still unknown. In our place every thing is an exploration, an adventure with unexpected outcomes! </p>
<p>I had known that Tamilnadu contains some pre-historic paintings. But some of them like at Porivarai can compete with Bimbetka, a world heritage site - in MP was news to me. What was not news to me was that no one knows about it, and also, no one cares! </p>
<p>Here are some interesting facts. It is only around the end of the 19 th century rock paintings in MP and UP were found. But, according to Poundurai, the earliest finding in Tamilnadu was only in 1980. I cannot believe it!</p>
<p>The famous Bimbetka is 5000 years old; but the Tamilnadu ones are only 2500 years old. All the Indian paintings belong to the third period. </p>
<p>Pre-historic rock paintings in Tamilnadu are mainly concentrated in Villupputran, Thiruvannamalai, Dharmapuri, Nilgiri districts. A few other places along the foothills of Western ghats, like Theni, also contain such paintings. All these, we are told, belong to a period from 500 BC to 500 AD.</p>
<p>Our choice was Kilvalai, as we could visit on our return from Pondicherry. If we have more time we could have visited a few more sites, like Settavarai, Alambadi, etc, which are close by. </p>
<p>Then we saw a large rock whose lower part of it was fenced. This must be the paintings we thought. Perhaps, there were, but no more, we found on exploring the boulder. A prelude to the remaining? We wandered around looking for the locations. There was another rock with similar fencing. A slightly dangerous climbing did not yield anything. It looked that we had come to the place that contained (note the past tense) paintings. But having come this far we wanted to make sure that we don't regret leter. Our search took us to the nearby quarry. Only two souls were working &#150; breaking stones under 40 degrees plus. The woman was helpful. She was not certain where the paintings were. Actually we couldn't explain what we were looking for. Pre-historic paintings would hardly make meaning to her, a god-forsaken soul whose horizon is no more than the next kavalam.) But she was prepared to show the route visitors took. She led us to a foot-path. After some distance the path was blocked with<br />thorns; some one has done this purposely. We ventured further. We could identify a few more rocks which were seen fenced. But these boulders were of considerable height. We had no clue how to go up. But a few empty Bisleri bottles and cigarette stubs gave us hopes. (See what items can give you hopes!) Siddhu ventured on one side; Udhaya on the other; myself simply on reconnaissance; and madam held fast to a stone under scorching sun with Kandha-shashti kavacham on her lips.</p>
<p>First fifteen minutes was blank. But then Udhaya (24 years) could make it. Then Siddhu (12 years) could make. They could make a thorough survey and, presto, they finally found. Paintings and paintings! Both became ecstatic. They went inside the fencing. (I don't understand. If they could go inside, what for are these fences?) More came to light. </p>
<p>They beckoned me. I did not want to miss the great sight. Against the wishes of the madam &#150; who went into more vigorous chanting &#150; I made it in spite of my back pain. Oh, a great sight. We could do a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of photo-ing. We could identify many of them. The famous hunters, men with animal heads, the sun were all clearly visible. Considering the outside temperature, the underneath of the boulders were comfortably cool. Thus we completed our holiday. </p>
<p>Now let me brood. Such visits set me thinking. I have visited quite a few sites abroad. They are all well documented, all facilities provided and sleek tours conducted. Here we don't even seem to know that these exist. Even if you come to know you would find difficult to locate the place. You will not find authentic information. </p>
<p>On the other hand if they are made tourist attractions as they do in the West, I shudder to think what would happen. Mountains of plastic rubbish, filth and grime, everything in the vicinity made into public convenience (to the utter inconvenience of the rest), and to add to this, all the fossils would be defaced with I-LOVE-YOUs! Or pilfered with nothing left for the future generation except the gate! </p>
<p>Then these quarries! Are they boons or bane? I am quite confused. I am certain that Kilvalai would be obliterated in a few decades; the paintings because of human interest in them and all the boulders broken and lost in road making, or gracing the floors of the rich. But don't quarries give employment to people, in these god-forsaken places, where one can not depend on agriculture? </p>
<p>Which is better? After all we get what we deserve. Do we have a holistic solution?</p>
<p>All these tourism, I am aware, are elitist, straight and simple. Should we create awareness about our heritage? I am not very clear. Without being very rational &#150; after all I am part of the middle-class, and we use rationality selectively, and we have intellectual arguments to justify anything &#150; I thing we should. But at what cost? I have no answer. </p>
<p>But if we choose to help in the preservation, my idea of compiling a cultural atlas of Tamilnadu is worth a trial.</p>
