        <p>Vijay,</p>
<p>I do think we all have the right to comment on/question any religion <br />or any other idea that fancies us. Whether thats appropriate for this <br />group is an entirely different issue altogether which might need to <br />be addressed. Also, I do not think any of us(whether its me, or Sri <br />or Sampath or Priya or whoever) is trying to address any personal <br />vendetta. None of us know each other and I do not think we have some <br />vague personal vendetta against any religion.</p>
<p>That said, your point that this has prob gone too much is taken! No <br />more!</p>

<p>If you cannot understand the difference between dying for some <br />politician and actually living and serving the poor of the world(and <br />maybe die in the process), well, I am done. I cannot but laugh at <br />myself for trying to maintain a conversation with someone who equates <br />one with the other. Lesson learnt!</p>
<p>First becoming a great soul was easy, Then it wasn't, now it is <br />again. First no one wanted to become one, now 'many' are not willing <br />to become one.</p>

<p>  Q:Sycophancy(dying for Vaiko or JJ or whoever) and service(actually <br />  helping the poor) are entirely two different things. I wish you <br />  wouldn't get confused between the two. If you call the first <br />  a "great soul", well, thats upto you! :)</p>
<p>  A:Hows that sycopancy?Idimazai udayan's love was pure.Maybe he <br />loved <br />  a wrong icon,but his love on vaiko is comparable to the love of the <br />  greatest of devotees on god.Very few people will die for their <br />loved <br />  ones by burning themselves.For vaiko and MDMK he is a great soul.He <br />  died for maybe 5 lakh MDMK people.People who die for african poor <br />  die for maybe 50 million people.But the underlying logic is <br />  same.Somebody dies to help somebody.</p>
<p>  Q:And please read your own posts abt what you said before you claim <br />  you did not say them - 'Becoming a great soul is easy' , 'no one <br />  wants to become one, they will only talk abt great souls' etc etc. </p>
<p>    Veena</p>
<p>  A:Becoming a great soul is easy-yes.But not many will be willing to <br />  become great souls.Very few will become great souls.While every <br />  Indian will proudly talk about soldiers who die in kashmir,not many <br />  will themselves go and fight in kashmir.Thats the irony which I <br />  pointed out.</p></blockquote>

        <p>That is true in a nearby christian school near my residence. They do pluck<br />the flowers of girls.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>The christian schools where mentioned here, which<br />allow Hindus to wear their symbol are mostly catholic<br />or <acronym title="Computer Society of India" CSI</acronym  groups.</p>
<p>But pentacost and other denomination christians do not<br />allow any Hindu to practice any type of their<br />religious things.</p>
<p>Can we point out one HINDU institution which<br />discriminate like this.</p>
<p>As Ms priya clearly told Deeemed university run by<br />Dhinakaran near coimbatore is having preaching hall<br />within campus and use all out the institutions for<br />conversions</p>
<p>Christian schools get financial aids from govt as well<br />as from abroad and mostly appoint techers as<br />recommended by the father of the church which runs.</p>
<p>These minorities use Brahmin and non brahmin<br />differences for their selfish aim of conversion.</p>
<p>It is true that schools run by brahmins prefer brahmin<br />students first. So is the case with the schools run by<br />say "mudaliyar" or "Nadars". There is nothing wrong<br />with it. But if every community helps their own<br />members also, ultimnately every one benefits.</p>
<p>I am not a brahmin. Brahmins might have done, say some<br />thing wrong in the past, But it is foolish to blame<br />every wrong thing happened/happeneing is due to them<br />and to allow such loop holes to be used by outsiders<br />for their conversion activities.</p>
<p>Educational institution/hospitals run by HINDU<br />missioneries are real selfless services whereas the<br />same run by christian missionries have the hidden<br />agenda of conversion.</p>
<p>Whether Mother theresa or CMC, vellore, there is no<br />exception. can they adopt a child named, Murugan and<br />bring him up as Murugan only till his adulthood.<br />Impossible.</p>
<p>See, how these missioneries put their nets for<br />conversion in the Tsunamai affected areas</p>
<p>Bye<br />MA Eswaran</p>

<p>I think you misunderstood what i was trying to say..<br />I thought from your earlier mail you were referring to the<br />RSS as "fascists"..</p>
<p>My reply was not to put the entire blame on RSS/VHP. I was<br />talking about the "secular" Muslim league which is a part of<br />the central government..</p>
<p>Do read the link that I mentioned in some spare time.. It's better<br />to argue with facts and knowledge.. Like all the religious text<br />there are some good parts and really bad ones.. (esp. about<br />slaves/prisoners of war/women/kafirs/apostates)..</p>
<p>I have nothing to do with any of the religions.. and am not<br />promoting one over the other..</p>
<p>My only concern is that we should NOT miss the bigger picture..<br />Valid questions raised by the VHP/RSS should not be brushed aside.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Somebody said about Christians converting by education.....</p>
<p>  So its easy to criticise....There are so many educated in this<br />community thanks to christain missionary schools and colleges???</p>
<p>  What were we HINDUs doing Running Gurukkuls exclusive for the<br />elite!!!The rest oh its mun jenma karma vinai!!</p>
<p>  Whats the percentage of schools in tamilnadu and what percentage of<br />private schools are by Christain Missions???</p>
<p>  How many of you are from Thanjavur??The KHS admission criteria was<br />you have to a brahmin or FC<br />  What are the other options St Antonys St Peters,Blakes &amp; Rajahs Govt<br />School<br />  For Girls Sacred Heart,St Josephs St Peters Blakes Rajahs Govt School<br />  (I am talking about the eighties)</p>
<p>  If converstion tactics worked 2/3 of thanjavur must be christians.......</p>

<p>  I was like you a couple of years back, trying to blame the RSS/VHP/BJP<br />  for all the communal riots / killings etc.. But of late I am getting a<br />  bit hesitant..</p>
<p>  It's sheer hypocrisy to call the "RSS" as communal and the "Muslim<br />  league" as secular. By trying to blame everything on RSS, we're<br />  missing a bigger picture. India is and will be secular because the<br />  majority are Hindus and I'm very happy for that and would like that to<br />  remain the same...</p>
<p>  We should at the same time be concerned about the activities of<br />  entities like the Saudi funded "tableegi jammat" etc.. that tries to<br />  destroy the local culture and "arabise" every muslim. You can see that<br />  from the names and the dresses they wear etc..</p>
<p>  So after all the terrorist incidents, I thought of learning somethings<br />  about islam and its supposed intolerance and find out if the<br />  allegations are really true.. I don't have many friends from the<br />  religion, but I have a few and they can hardly be classified as<br />liberals..</p>
<p>  If you have time, read this website from a department of an university<br />  in US that contains the authentic translations of Quran into english</p>

<p>  Particularly the treatment of kafirs / slaves / women etc.. You can<br />  see that, Bin laden follows the teachings perfectly..</p>
<p>  It's disgusting..</p>
<p>  I get the same "disgusting" feeling when reading the so called<br />  "theivathin kural" from the kanchi mutt's website.. which condones<br />  "untouchability" and preaches "caste system" based on birth..</p>
<p>  I just want you to be aware of all these things..</p>

<p>Q:Sycophancy(dying for Vaiko or JJ or whoever) and service(actually <br />helping the poor) are entirely two different things. I wish you <br />wouldn't get confused between the two. If you call the first <br />a "great soul", well, thats upto you! :)</p>
<p>A:Hows that sycopancy?Idimazai udayan's love was pure.Maybe he loved <br />a wrong icon,but his love on vaiko is comparable to the love of the <br />greatest of devotees on god.Very few people will die for their loved <br />ones by burning themselves.For vaiko and MDMK he is a great soul.He <br />died for maybe 5 lakh MDMK people.People who die for african poor <br />die for maybe 50 million people.But the underlying logic is <br />same.Somebody dies to help somebody.</p>
<p>Q:And please read your own posts abt what you said before you claim <br />you did not say them - 'Becoming a great soul is easy' , 'no one <br />wants to become one, they will only talk abt great souls' etc etc. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Veena</p></blockquote>
<p>A:Becoming a great soul is easy-yes.But not many will be willing to <br />become great souls.Very few will become great souls.While every <br />Indian will proudly talk about soldiers who die in kashmir,not many <br />will themselves go and fight in kashmir.Thats the irony which I <br />pointed out.</p>

<p>  Q:I am not going to enter into this politics/religion debate again <br />  but I could not let this one go by as this is not about religion or <br />  politics or any such nonsense. </p>
<p>  A:Religion and politics is nonsense?Ok,fine</p>
<p>  Q:Becoming a 'great soul' is NOT easy. (Great soul(as defined by <br />  you) as someone who gives up studies/family and serves the poor in <br />  some African country). Try doing it for a week and you will realise <br />  what courage it involves. I have 7 friends who do that all over <br />the <br />  world (no religious affiliations whatsoever) and do you know why <br />  they do it? Because they enjoy service; not because it will serve <br />  them in this life or in a later life. </p>
<p>  A:I did not say becoming a great soul is easy.I do not deny that it <br />  involves courage.I said I dont want to become a great soul.Great <br />  souls usually end up being nailed to cross or shot dead in prayer <br />  meetings.If they are happy with it,let them go ahead.</p>
<p>  I also am happy about your friends.I usually dont give much <br />  weightage to religious people doing social service,since that term <br />  is humbug.If service is done as part of religion,then that service <br />  is done to take the believer to heaven and not done with social <br />  welfare in mind.If your friends dont believe in God and do it for <br />  love of society then I put them above believers who do social <br />  service.</p>
<p>  Q:If you cannot understand it, thats fine, but please do not demean <br />  the services of thousands of people all over the world who use <br />  their time to give something to the world expecting nothing in <br />  return. </p>
<p>  A:I understand it perfectly.When Vaiko was dismissed from DMK, a <br />  martyr or great soul named idimazai udayan poured kerosene over <br />  himself and died a cruel death for the sake of Vaiko.</p>
<p>  When MK,MGR,JJ were arrested many great souls died for their <br />  leaders.Vaiko will never forget idimazai udayan.Idimazai udayan's <br />  wife,children and parents also will not forget him.</p>
<p>  Do I want to be Vaiko or idimazai udayan?I choose to be vaiko.If <br />  somebody chooses to be idimazai udayan I will welcome it.I will <br />  praise him,garland him and call him "great <br />soul","maaveeran","pachai <br />  tamilan", "thiyagi","rathathin ratham" etc.</p>
<p>  Idimazai udayan excepted nothing in return from Vaiko.That's why <br />  he's a great soul.Whoever is willing to be great souls,I welcome <br />  them.</p>
<p>  Q:And please do not say no one wants to do it. There will be no <br />  Doctors without Borders, no Red Cross(how many more voluntary <br />  service orgs do you want me to quote?) without these people. How <br />  many people do you want me to put you in touch with who do it <br />  everyday of their lives?</p>
<p>  A:I am not demeaning them.I called them as martyrs, great souls and <br />  bali aadu's.Is that demeaning?</p>
<p>  The great souls themselves will not refuse it. Jesus called <br />  himself as a bali aadu.</p>
<p>  Jesus as a lamb is a sacrifice for mankind's sins. In the heavenly <br />  court Jesus appears as "a Lamb standing as if it had been <br />  slaughtered" (Rev. 5:6; cf. 13:8). The heavenly choir <br />  proclaimed: "You were slaughtered and by your blood you ransomed <br />for <br />  God saints from every tribe and language and people and nation" <br />  (Rev. 5:9). Cleansing is made possible "by the blood of the Lamb" <br />  (Rev. 7:14; cf. 1:5).</p>
<p>  How is that demeaning?</p></blockquote>

<p>  (I will tell you a secret.Great soul=thiyagi=bali adu=punnagai <br />  mannan)All will praise such great souls but nobody will want to <br />  become a great soul.</p>

<p>  She wasted her life,thats it.What use was her great soul title ?<br />  zilch.</p>
<p>  Q:It might not work all the time but its better than revenge. <br />After <br />  all, whats the difference between the killer and the avenger if <br />  they both do the same thing? </p>
<p>  A:Killer lives happily,the great soul dies happily.Thats the <br />  difference.</p>

        <p>Thanks Satish. Yes, you are right - "The truth will never come out". <br />How nice for the real perpetarators. And how nice for people who can <br />spin any conspiracy theories. No evidence needed. Just some <br />convoluted partisan logic. </p>
<p>And ofcourse, if the truth comes out, the "communist-controlled <br />media" will never publish it.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Ms.veena,</p>
<p>  You are again tempting me to break my 6 years of practice, replying <br />  mails after I read all of them. Anyway, never mind. Change is <br />  inevitable.</p>
<p>  The first day when i heard the news, I too, like others thoght it <br />to <br />  be true. Though I studied in the University run by the Kanchi Mutt, <br />  we friends used to go and do namaskaram to Jeyendrar only for his <br />  kalkandu. Meaning, I never had any great affiliation or detachment <br />  towards the mutt or periyava. </p>
<p>  But if you are closely watching the things happening, any person <br />with <br />  some logic can deduce that its a well enacted screenplay. I am not <br />  going into details. If you want just look at the incidents happened <br />  and you will find that everything happens at a fixed pace. <br />  sollivechapala nadakuthunu solluva ella. andha madhiri..When they <br />  cant fix him one case, several cases are being charged against him. <br />  This incident has only gained a lot of support to the mutt and <br />  periyava than distroying thier image. Amma va pathi naan en sollale <br />  na, she is just a weapon. Her case is in Bangalore court, and <br />  Karnataka is ruled by Congress. Sonia's background work is greatly <br />  hailed even by the media(only a few ofcourse) in the Goa, <br />Jharkand, <br />  Bihar politics today. So when she is capable of doing such things <br />  openly, she is capable of doing things unknowingly also. Probably <br />as <br />  you say, we dont have proof to all these, and as Jeyendrar himself <br />  told to George Fernandes,"The truth will never come out".<br />  Ammakku kasu kudutha enna venumnalum pannuvanga. <br />  She lost the last years election. So for the next she is thinking <br />  about congress support. so logically.....</p>

<p>    Questions on quoted "facts":</p>
<p>    "We should remember that our countries media is in the hands of <br />the <br />    communist and they are anti-hindu, pro=muslim or pro-christian. <br />  They <br />    will publish anything for money. Kanchi case is again a standing <br />    example how our religion is targeted by the christians(its said <br />  that <br />    foreing missionaries with the help of sonia is beind this because <br />    Jeyendrar is the only person in thier path who is trying to stop <br />    conversion.)" </p>
<p>    - Any evidence for any of this? Our entire country's media(this <br />    includes everything from 'The Pioneer' to 'Tughlaq' to 'The <br />    Telegraph') is apparently in 'communist'(whatever that means) <br />    control! Wow. Foreign missionaries along with Sonia are behind <br />the <br />    Kanchi mutt case - please note how our favorite 'Amma' is <br />mentioned <br />    nowhere in the picture! She is a victim after all :)</p>

        <p>Just facts please:</p>
<p>1. "RSS cleared 3000 bodies" - Might be true but the evidence for <br />this is? Some RSS website, I presume? </p>
<p>And you raise more questions. "Other NGOs did not dare to enter" - <br />Every other NGO? And the evidence for that is?</p>
<p>2. Lakhs of years ago? Do you know the age of earth? Or the age of <br />human beings? I mean facts, not beliefs. Slight difference between <br />the two, I am afraid. I told you already, your belief is yours. I am <br />not arguing against that at all. If what you have posted throughout <br />is what you believe without supporting facts, just say that and we <br />will end this conversation right here. I am more interested in facts. </p>
<p>3. A religion without a revolution? You are kidding right? Whatever <br />happened to Buddhism and Jainism? Whatever happened to every saint <br />who went against accepted dogma in Hinduism? What about whats <br />happening in present-day Hinduism - in terms of lower castes <br />exercising their rights? Just because Communism failed in the last <br />century, is it right to say that the 1917 October revolution never <br />happened?</p>
<p>3. Harvesting souls is def a Christian idea. But you said this <br />strategy was put in place 300 years ago. And you also expect to <br />believe that every missionary org in the entire world works with this <br />goal in mind. Cool!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Veena,</p>
<p>  As I used to say, I have the habit of reading all the mails before <br />I <br />  reply. This one is an exception. </p>
<p>  I am not good at stats as you are. I was mentioning that RSS <br />cleared <br />  more than 3500 bodies, most of them in decomposed state which all <br />  other ngo's did not even dare to go near. TNs toll is I think 12500 <br />  in Tsunami out of which more than 3000 bodies were cleared by the <br />  RSS. I am sorry its not 20%,but even 3000 bodies out of 12500 makes <br />  it 24%, and I think it was more than 3000 (3500 not sure, but <br />surely <br />  above 3000). Thanks for giving me a chance to let me know that <br />RSS's <br />  service was much more than what I was thinking. I have <br />underestimated <br />  RSS's service and thanks for clarifying the same.</p>
<p>  Christianity is just 2000 years old and so many revolutions against <br />  the religion, its slavery etc. etc...Hinduism is ageless, belivers <br />  like me think its lakhs of years old. Comparing revolutions in <br />other <br />  relgions which are hardly 2000 and 1500 years old against a <br />religion <br />  without any revolution so far, which is lakhs of years old is like <br />  comparing Mt.everest to chinna malai in Sidapet...even a child wont <br />  do that.</p>
<p>  Pope john paul, when he visited India two three years back said <br />this <br />  (not sure about the wordings, but this is the crux) "First thousand <br />y <br />  ears we converted Europe into Jesus land, next 1000 years we <br />  converted Africa and other other continents(I think America, <br />  Australia etc) into Jesus land, the next 1000 years we should <br />convert <br />  the whole of Asia into Jesus land". 0-1000 AD Eorupe, 1001-2000 <br />rest <br />  of the world, 2000-3000 Asia, particularly India. I think this is <br />the <br />  message told by Pope. I never said it Veena, the pope himself told <br />  this. -:)</p>
<p>  If I hit you, probably you may show me the other kannam like jesus <br />or <br />  buddha. If you hit me, I will surely hit you twice as hard as you <br />  did. Thats human nature. That doesnt mean violence is answer to <br />  violence. Its sponteneous reaction. I said, hindu org. react but <br />they <br />  never acted so far...</p>
<p>  I think I have answered/cleared all your queries. You are most <br />  welcome to shoot more, we are ready to answer. -:)</p>

<p>    Facts check on this post:</p>
<p>    "During Tsunami, ofcourse all the ngo's worked. But the first to <br />    reach out was RSS who singly contributed to 20% of the total <br />    effort." - As someone who lives in excel spreadsheets and runs <br />stat <br />    models everyday, I am a little too picky about numbers. 20%? <br />Which <br />    means that you have somehow managed to measure the amount of <br />relief <br />    that poured in after the tsunami. Something which the UN still <br />  hasn't <br />    managed to do! Interesting! Can you give us hard numbers - number <br />  of <br />    people, organizations, places, all verifiable? Please note: I am <br />  not <br />    questioning that RSS or any other org did relief work. I am sure <br />  they <br />    did and I'd the first to give them credit for that. The same <br />credit <br />    I'd give DYFI workers who did the same work. I only have issues <br />  with <br />    throwing hard numbers around without any evidence whatsoever!</p>
<p>    "Why didnt Hinduism burst if it had suppressions?" - Same logic <br />    as 'Slavery never existed as Christainity is still around. There <br />  have <br />    been stray instances of slavery ofcourse but the Bible never <br />    supported it . Its all misrepresentation'. Revolutions are not <br />all <br />    swift and bloody.</p>
<p>    "I appreciate the western countries and the missionaries a lot. <br />  They <br />    are great strategists. They are not aiming and immediate <br />  conversion. <br />    They have a 100 or 1000 year plan, which started 300 years <br />back." - <br />    No evidence, no supporting facts. Note again: I know very well <br />how <br />    missionaries operate and I am not questioning whether they use <br />    underhand tactics(we all know they do). I only have issues with <br />  this <br />    100/1000 year plans and such conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>    "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. RSS/Hindu org. <br />    reacted but I dont think they acted at any point of time. Veena, <br />  why <br />    you are not talking about the godhra carnage but only talk about <br />  the <br />    hindus burning muslims on the streets? This is the Marxist or <br />  rather <br />    anti-BJP talks." - Not entirely sure what is Marxist talk! When <br />    someone says the answer to violence is not more violence, it does <br />  not <br />    mean that person is condoning violence on one side. </p>

<p>One member asked in the open letter like this,<br />******* "Since in my present religion I do not have<br />any caste, once <br />you convert me back to Hinduism, will you provide a<br />casteless place"</p>
<p>Suppose I come to chrisitianity, can you pl give<br />"groupless" christianity. <br />Not like catholic, protestant, pentakost, 7th<br />day,syrian catholic,matheuma etc<br />Did Jesus give such divsions? It may not be by the<br />name caste but by some group.</p>
<p>Again if I come to say, catholic christian, then I<br />have to be either nadar christian or pillaimar<br />christian or SC christian or <acronym title="Computer Society of India" CSI</acronym  Nadar christian etc.</p>

<p>  Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>  yesterday, on Wednesday 10 November, the Faculty of Philosophy of the<br />  University of Cologne decided that the Cologne Institute of Indology and<br />  Tamil Studies will be closed down after my retirement in March 2006.</p>
<p>  This decision was reached at faculty level, but if it is carried out, it<br />  would mean not only the loss of yet another South Asian Studies chair,<br />  but also the destruction of the entire discipline "Tamil Studies" in<br />  Germany.</p>
<p>  I would like to ask you herewith to express your solidarity. Please send<br />  your note of protest against the demise of Indology at the University of<br />  Cologne to the following address:</p>
<p>  University of Cologne<br />  The Rector<br />  Albertus-Magnus-Platz<br />  D-50923 Cologne<br />  Germany</p>

<p>  vyasa bharatha clearly elevates ekalavya and says<br />  what drona did was wrong.There are many instances of bhramins<br />  accepting non-bhramins as disciples. vasishta accepted viswamithra a<br />  ksathriya as bhrammarishi and we have saying "vasistar vayal<br />  bhrammarishi".smartha Ramdoss accepted shivaji (a dalit) as his<br />  disciple.Valmiki and vyasa themselves were dalits.Vyasa fathered<br />  trutharasthra and pandu through ksathriya queens ambika and<br />  ambalika.So even arjuna was a dalit by birth.Did drona hesitate to<br />  accept them as his disciples?</p>
<p>  Vyasa clearly says that it was due to the jealousy<br />  of arjuna that these things happened.Arjuna was jealous of ekalavya<br />  and begged drona not to teach him.Similiarly karna had a fight with<br />  arjuna and arjuna prevented him learning from drona using his<br />  influence.Drona listened to arjuna because arjuna had promised him<br />  that he will enslave durupatha whom drona despised so badly.</p>

<p>This is a most unexpected and upsetting news, especially in <br />the year that the Indian Government decided to declare Tamil <br />as a Classical Language. <br />All efforts must be taken to seek a way to reverse the <br />decision.<br />I am sure we will all support whatever measures are to be <br />taken in this direction.</p>

<p>  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>  Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>  yesterday, on Wednesday 10 November, the Faculty of Philosophy of the<br />  University of Cologne decided that the Cologne Institute of Indology and<br />  Tamil Studies will be closed down after my retirement in March 2006.</p>
<p>  This decision was reached at faculty level, but if it is carried out, it<br />  would mean not only the loss of yet another South Asian Studies chair,<br />  but also the destruction of the entire discipline "Tamil Studies" in<br />  Germany.</p>
<p>  I would like to ask you herewith to express your solidarity. Please send<br />  your note of protest against the demise of Indology at the University of<br />  Cologne to the following address:</p>
<p>  University of Cologne<br />  The Rector<br />  Albertus-Magnus-Platz<br />  D-50923 Cologne<br />  Germany</p>
<p>  Thanking you in advance,<br />  Yours,<br />  Prof. Dr. D. B. Kapp<br />  Institute of Indology and Tamil Studies<br />  Director<br />  <a href="mailto:db.kapp@uni-koeln.de">db.kapp@uni-koeln.de</a></p></blockquote>

        <p>Dear Ms.veena,</p>
<p>You are again tempting me to break my 6 years of practice, replying <br />mails after I read all of them. Anyway, never mind. Change is <br />inevitable.</p>
<p>The first day when i heard the news, I too, like others thoght it to <br />be true. Though I studied in the University run by the Kanchi Mutt, <br />we friends used to go and do namaskaram to Jeyendrar only for his <br />kalkandu. Meaning, I never had any great affiliation or detachment <br />towards the mutt or periyava. </p>
<p>But if you are closely watching the things happening, any person with <br />some logic can deduce that its a well enacted screenplay. I am not <br />going into details. If you want just look at the incidents happened <br />and you will find that everything happens at a fixed pace. <br />sollivechapala nadakuthunu solluva ella. andha madhiri..When they <br />cant fix him one case, several cases are being charged against him. <br />This incident has only gained a lot of support to the mutt and <br />periyava than distroying thier image. Amma va pathi naan en sollale <br />na, she is just a weapon. Her case is in Bangalore court, and <br />Karnataka is ruled by Congress. Sonia's background work is greatly <br />hailed even by the media(only a few ofcourse) in the Goa, Jharkand, <br />Bihar politics today. So when she is capable of doing such things <br />openly, she is capable of doing things unknowingly also. Probably as <br />you say, we dont have proof to all these, and as Jeyendrar himself <br />told to George Fernandes,"The truth will never come out".<br />Ammakku kasu kudutha enna venumnalum pannuvanga. <br />She lost the last years election. So for the next she is thinking <br />about congress support. so logically.....</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Veena,</p>
<p>As I used to say, I have the habit of reading all the mails before I <br />reply. This one is an exception. </p>
<p>I am not good at stats as you are. I was mentioning that RSS cleared <br />more than 3500 bodies, most of them in decomposed state which all <br />other ngo's did not even dare to go near. TNs toll is I think 12500 <br />in Tsunami out of which more than 3000 bodies were cleared by the <br />RSS. I am sorry its not 20%,but even 3000 bodies out of 12500 makes <br />it 24%, and I think it was more than 3000 (3500 not sure, but surely <br />above 3000). Thanks for giving me a chance to let me know that RSS's <br />service was much more than what I was thinking. I have underestimated <br />RSS's service and thanks for clarifying the same.</p>
<p>Christianity is just 2000 years old and so many revolutions against <br />the religion, its slavery etc. etc...Hinduism is ageless, belivers <br />like me think its lakhs of years old. Comparing revolutions in other <br />relgions which are hardly 2000 and 1500 years old against a religion <br />without any revolution so far, which is lakhs of years old is like <br />comparing Mt.everest to chinna malai in Sidapet...even a child wont <br />do that.</p>
<p>Pope john paul, when he visited India two three years back said this <br />(not sure about the wordings, but this is the crux) "First thousand y <br />ears we converted Europe into Jesus land, next 1000 years we <br />converted Africa and other other continents(I think America, <br />Australia etc) into Jesus land, the next 1000 years we should convert <br />the whole of Asia into Jesus land". 0-1000 AD Eorupe, 1001-2000 rest <br />of the world, 2000-3000 Asia, particularly India. I think this is the <br />message told by Pope. I never said it Veena, the pope himself told <br />this. -:)</p>
<p>If I hit you, probably you may show me the other kannam like jesus or <br />buddha. If you hit me, I will surely hit you twice as hard as you <br />did. Thats human nature. That doesnt mean violence is answer to <br />violence. Its sponteneous reaction. I said, hindu org. react but they <br />never acted so far...</p>
<p>I think I have answered/cleared all your queries. You are most <br />welcome to shoot more, we are ready to answer. -:)</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

<blockquote><p>  Facts check on this post:</p>
<p>  "During Tsunami, ofcourse all the ngo's worked. But the first to <br />  reach out was RSS who singly contributed to 20% of the total <br />  effort." - As someone who lives in excel spreadsheets and runs stat <br />  models everyday, I am a little too picky about numbers. 20%? Which <br />  means that you have somehow managed to measure the amount of relief <br />  that poured in after the tsunami. Something which the UN still <br />hasn't <br />  managed to do! Interesting! Can you give us hard numbers - number <br />of <br />  people, organizations, places, all verifiable? Please note: I am <br />not <br />  questioning that RSS or any other org did relief work. I am sure <br />they <br />  did and I'd the first to give them credit for that. The same credit <br />  I'd give DYFI workers who did the same work. I only have issues <br />with <br />  throwing hard numbers around without any evidence whatsoever!</p>
<p>  "Why didnt Hinduism burst if it had suppressions?" - Same logic <br />  as 'Slavery never existed as Christainity is still around. There <br />have <br />  been stray instances of slavery ofcourse but the Bible never <br />  supported it . Its all misrepresentation'. Revolutions are not all <br />  swift and bloody.</p>
<p>  "I appreciate the western countries and the missionaries a lot. <br />They <br />  are great strategists. They are not aiming and immediate <br />conversion. <br />  They have a 100 or 1000 year plan, which started 300 years back." - <br />  No evidence, no supporting facts. Note again: I know very well how <br />  missionaries operate and I am not questioning whether they use <br />  underhand tactics(we all know they do). I only have issues with <br />this <br />  100/1000 year plans and such conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>  "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. RSS/Hindu org. <br />  reacted but I dont think they acted at any point of time. Veena, <br />why <br />  you are not talking about the godhra carnage but only talk about <br />the <br />  hindus burning muslims on the streets? This is the Marxist or <br />rather <br />  anti-BJP talks." - Not entirely sure what is Marxist talk! When <br />  someone says the answer to violence is not more violence, it does <br />not <br />  mean that person is condoning violence on one side. </p>

I am <br />also not suggesting that one should show the other cheek. In a <br />democracy, there are always democratic and non-violent avenues open<br />(as we Indians should very well know). It might not work all the time <br />but its better than revenge. After all, whats the difference between <br />the killer and the avenger if they both do the same thing?

<p>Anyone remember this kid called Ekalavya?</p>
<p>vyasa bharatha clearly elevates ekalavya and says<br />what drona did was wrong.There are many instances of bhramins<br />accepting non-bhramins as disciples. vasishta accepted viswamithra a<br />ksathriya as bhrammarishi and we have saying "vasistar vayal<br />bhrammarishi".smartha Ramdoss accepted shivaji (a dalit) as his<br />disciple.Valmiki and vyasa themselves were dalits.Vyasa fathered<br />trutharasthra and pandu through ksathriya queens ambika and<br />ambalika.So even arjuna was a dalit by birth.Did drona hesitate to<br />accept them as his disciples?</p>
<p>Vyasa clearly says that it was due to the jealousy<br />of arjuna that these things happened.Arjuna was jealous of ekalavya<br />and begged drona not to teach him.Similiarly karna had a fight with<br />arjuna and arjuna prevented him learning from drona using his<br />influence.Drona listened to arjuna because arjuna had promised him<br />that he will enslave durupatha whom drona despised so badly.</p>

<p>    Again I am wondering, how the westerners and our own people with <br />    vested interest have spoiled our minds. Translations for vedas <br />were <br />    first written by the westerners. Sanskirt like other language, <br />has <br />    words which gives many meanings for the same words. Every sloka <br />can <br />    be interpreted in several ways. Westerners took only the wrong <br />    meaning and spread it to the uneducated mass only to convert them <br />  and <br />    still we people are following those bashyams as the original <br />  bashyam <br />    for vedas. </p>
<p>    Sampath has thrown much light on this. Cho is writing an article <br />in <br />    Tuqlaq titled "Hindu Maha Samudram" which is a must read for all, <br />  in <br />    which he ponders all these topics. Before three hundered years, <br />    people were happy and peaceful without much discrimination. RR's <br />    Talicheri kalvettu is a standing proof for this. The Tanjai <br />  pictures <br />    clearly show that even queens did not wear upper garments in <br />those <br />    days. We have historic proof for all the equalities we had in the <br />  past<br />    (again talicheri kalvettu is the standing example where a King <br />    respects even the kadai nilai oozhiyan). But only after the <br />  europeans <br />    entered India all the confusion started. And we got corrupted in <br />  our <br />    minds and blindly follow what they told to confuse us. This <br />  weakness <br />    is what they are using for conversion, and thats what I am <br />  repeatedly <br />    trying to stress.But ....</p>
<p>    The open letter was funny enough to read. Sampath has torn it <br />  apart. <br />    Any christian or muslim can very well have written that letter in <br />    disguise to tarnish Hindus image? can you prove me wrong??...</p>
<p>    Sri talks about all the wrong things Manusmrithi talks <br />about..Again <br />  I <br />    say i have not read manusmrithi. But if at all the scriptures <br />  define <br />    treatment to different varnas(I dont accept the caste based <br />system, <br />    it was only varna dharma), the same scriptures also say that what <br />    deed of each varna will lead them to moksha..</p>
<p>    A brahmin has to get up early, do his daily routines like <br />    sandhyavandhanam, do pooja, do yagnja, chant vedas the whole day <br />  and <br />    should always be doing all these for the welfare of the society. <br />  Its <br />    scientifically proven what impact the environment has when vedas <br />  are <br />    chanted and yagams are done. They should not posses any wealth, <br />  apart <br />    from their next time meal. These rituals will take the whole day <br />  and <br />    brahmins has to do all this throughout their life to attain <br />moksha. <br />    It goes in the descending order and for sudhras its more than <br />  enough <br />    if they utter the lords name once, just once a day , to attain <br />    moksha. Why my dear friend Sri is not looking at this point? </p>
<p>    Re. Misinterpreation of vedas et all..I read on article written <br />by <br />    some vested interest in Islam. It goes like this. We Hindus pray <br />  lord <br />    shiva in the form of 'Lingam'. We all dont realise the basics <br />  behind <br />    our religion and thats our weakness. Lingam is called Aroopa <br />  Roopam , <br />    the formless form. People like Benny hin will call Hindus as <br />    prostitutes because we do Idol worship and the so called seculars <br />    will clap happily for this. Hinduism says the higest form of god, <br />  the <br />    Brahmam does not have any form and Lingam symbolises it. Then why <br />    such a semi circular (to some extent) form is given to LIngam? <br />    Anywhere in this universe, if we stand in any place and look <br />above <br />    us, the area which our eyes can see is only a hemisphere above us <br />  and <br />    if you can visualise, thats nothing but the form of Lingam and <br />  thats <br />    why shiva is given that formless form.</p>
<p>    COming to the article (misinterpreation) I read. It seems Lingam <br />  has <br />    another meaning in Sanskrit. It denotes the male sexual organ. <br />The <br />    article claims that Hindus are perverted and enjoy sexuality and <br />    thats why we have given the form of the male sexual organ to our <br />  god <br />    Shiva. And we happily name our children as Ramalingam(Rama's ----<br />) <br />    Sundaralingam (Beautiful ---).. etc. Any sane person who knows <br />  about <br />    Hinduism will laugh at this. Does this make any sense? Probably <br />for <br />    the poeople who go by the western/communist/Dravidian ideologies <br />  will <br />    accept this and say Hinduism is all bullshit..</p>
<p>    Dr.Sri, whatever you quote about manusmrithi or the <br />discrimination <br />    among the people refered in the scriptures etc. only reminded me <br />of <br />    the above said artilce. I dont want to write this, but I needed <br />an <br />    example to clear some of the misinterpreation you have. Any <br />person <br />    who is against hinduism could have written the bashyam for the <br />    scripts which you could have read. That doesnt make the end of <br />it. <br />    Thats what I repeatedly say, we have brains to think and we <br />should <br />    think logically. Stray incidents do not make what Hinduism <br />actually <br />    is. Please Please Please try to understand this.</p>
<p>    I could not read the link you sent, because my office interet <br />  policy <br />    prohibits some pages based on the meta-tags. I dont know what the <br />    news holds, but I am assured that whatever ill feeling(probably <br />    adhamgam towards our religion) you have towards Hinduism is by <br />    reading news articles in papers etc. Again let me quote you how <br />far <br />    media news are true. SPS very recently pointed out the mistake in <br />    Dina thanthi that the article reg. Aadichanlur kalvettu, <br />misquoted <br />    Ashoka and Maurya dynasty as Akbar and Mughal dynasty. The mass <br />who <br />    read such news will only belive the paper and even if you or I go <br />  and <br />    tell them the truth they will not belive. I personally have <br />  witnessed <br />    it. When I was doing my MCA, Kumudham came to our university for <br />an <br />    article. They took interview of us and went back.Later whenthe <br />    article was published, whatever I said was published as told by <br />my <br />    classmate, a girl, and whatever i never said were published as if <br />I <br />    told them. oru panai sotrukku oru soru padam. THis is how media <br />  plays <br />    with news. Only 30%of what you read is true and if you think them <br />  to <br />    be ultimate, I dont have an answer to you. Even in Kanchi case, <br />the <br />    entire media published all the wrong news for publicity, but <br />  whenthe <br />    Justice in Hyderabad high court blasted the media in on PIL and <br />  when <br />    the SC blasted the media, TN govt and the laywers for coming up <br />  with <br />    a case where there is not even a single evidence against the <br />  acharya <br />    in the murder case, no media published it. What will be the <br />mindset <br />    of people who read the papers alone will have?They will surely <br />  think <br />    wrong about the acharya and will never know the truth. We should <br />    remember that our countries media is in the hands of the <br />communist <br />    and they are anti-hindu, pro=muslim or pro-christian. They will <br />    publish anything for money. Kanchi case is again a standing <br />example <br />    how our religion is targeted by the christians(its said that <br />  foreing <br />    missionaries with the help of sonia is beind this because <br />Jeyendrar <br />    is the only person in thier path who is trying to stop <br />conversion.)</p>
<p>    As Krishna says in Gita, if you think, Hinduism is good it surely <br />  is <br />    good, if you think its bad its surely bad. If you look through <br />    coloured glass everything will look coloured. Remove the glass <br />and <br />    look at the facts </p>

<p>  *Gurukuls were never for the elite.people like <br />  kusela learnt along with the yadava lord krishna.People <br />  like 'therotti magan' karna learnt along with arjuna.Even asuras <br />had <br />  their guru sukracharya.many sudras were gurus themselves like sage <br />  vyasa who was the son of a dalit fisherwoman.Christian schools <br />  mushroom only since government gives priority for them in starting <br />  schools.As a result remakrishna mission has to claim that it wasnt <br />  hindu,and got minority status and started colleges and schools.</p>
<p>    Whats the percentage of schools in tamilnadu and what percentage <br />  of private schools are by Christain Missions???</p>
<p>  *schools are money minting machines.Government gives <br />  permission only to minorities to start it.No wonder.</p>
<p>    How many of you are from Thanjavur??The KHS admission criteria <br />was <br />  you have to a brahmin or FC</p>
<p>  *In a famous minority university in kovai first <br />  prefernce to jobs go to pentecostal christians,next to other <br />  christians,last to RC and muslims and hindus come last.</p>
<p>    If converstion tactics worked 2/3 of thanjavur must be <br />  christians.......</p>
<p>    You can go on and On,....</p>
<p>  *Hindu children are prevented from wearing <br />pottu,namam <br />  and thiruneeru in schools run by other religions.At times they are <br />  even punished for this.Inspite of this many children are still <br />  hindus shows the strength of our religion.</p></sridhar_rathinam@y...></p></blockquote>

<p>  The open letter was funny enough to read. Sampath has torn it <br />apart. <br />  Any christian or muslim can very well have written that letter in <br />  disguise to tarnish Hindus image? can you prove me wrong??...</p>
<p>  Sri talks about all the wrong things Manusmrithi talks about..Again <br />I <br />  say i have not read manusmrithi. But if at all the scriptures <br />define <br />  treatment to different varnas(I dont accept the caste based system, <br />  it was only varna dharma), the same scriptures also say that what <br />  deed of each varna will lead them to moksha..</p>
<p>  A brahmin has to get up early, do his daily routines like <br />  sandhyavandhanam, do pooja, do yagnja, chant vedas the whole day <br />and <br />  should always be doing all these for the welfare of the society. <br />Its <br />  scientifically proven what impact the environment has when vedas <br />are <br />  chanted and yagams are done. They should not posses any wealth, <br />apart <br />  from their next time meal. These rituals will take the whole day <br />and <br />  brahmins has to do all this throughout their life to attain moksha. <br />  It goes in the descending order and for sudhras its more than <br />enough <br />  if they utter the lords name once, just once a day , to attain <br />  moksha. Why my dear friend Sri is not looking at this point? </p>
<p>  Re. Misinterpreation of vedas et all..I read on article written by <br />  some vested interest in Islam. It goes like this. We Hindus pray <br />lord <br />  shiva in the form of 'Lingam'. We all dont realise the basics <br />behind <br />  our religion and thats our weakness. Lingam is called Aroopa <br />Roopam , <br />  the formless form. People like Benny hin will call Hindus as <br />  prostitutes because we do Idol worship and the so called seculars <br />  will clap happily for this. Hinduism says the higest form of god, <br />the <br />  Brahmam does not have any form and Lingam symbolises it. Then why <br />  such a semi circular (to some extent) form is given to LIngam? <br />  Anywhere in this universe, if we stand in any place and look above <br />  us, the area which our eyes can see is only a hemisphere above us <br />and <br />  if you can visualise, thats nothing but the form of Lingam and <br />thats <br />  why shiva is given that formless form.</p>
<p>  COming to the article (misinterpreation) I read. It seems Lingam <br />has <br />  another meaning in Sanskrit. It denotes the male sexual organ. The <br />  article claims that Hindus are perverted and enjoy sexuality and <br />  thats why we have given the form of the male sexual organ to our <br />god <br />  Shiva. And we happily name our children as Ramalingam(Rama's ----) <br />  Sundaralingam (Beautiful ---).. etc. Any sane person who knows <br />about <br />  Hinduism will laugh at this. Does this make any sense? Probably for <br />  the poeople who go by the western/communist/Dravidian ideologies <br />will <br />  accept this and say Hinduism is all bullshit..</p>
<p>  Dr.Sri, whatever you quote about manusmrithi or the discrimination <br />  among the people refered in the scriptures etc. only reminded me of <br />  the above said artilce. I dont want to write this, but I needed an <br />  example to clear some of the misinterpreation you have. Any person <br />  who is against hinduism could have written the bashyam for the <br />  scripts which you could have read. That doesnt make the end of it. <br />  Thats what I repeatedly say, we have brains to think and we should <br />  think logically. Stray incidents do not make what Hinduism actually <br />  is. Please Please Please try to understand this.</p>
<p>  I could not read the link you sent, because my office interet <br />policy <br />  prohibits some pages based on the meta-tags. I dont know what the <br />  news holds, but I am assured that whatever ill feeling(probably <br />  adhamgam towards our religion) you have towards Hinduism is by <br />  reading news articles in papers etc. Again let me quote you how far <br />  media news are true. SPS very recently pointed out the mistake in <br />  Dina thanthi that the article reg. Aadichanlur kalvettu, misquoted <br />  Ashoka and Maurya dynasty as Akbar and Mughal dynasty. The mass who <br />  read such news will only belive the paper and even if you or I go <br />and <br />  tell them the truth they will not belive. I personally have <br />witnessed <br />  it. When I was doing my MCA, Kumudham came to our university for an <br />  article. They took interview of us and went back.Later whenthe <br />  article was published, whatever I said was published as told by my <br />  classmate, a girl, and whatever i never said were published as if I <br />  told them. oru panai sotrukku oru soru padam. THis is how media <br />plays <br />  with news. Only 30%of what you read is true and if you think them <br />to <br />  be ultimate, I dont have an answer to you. Even in Kanchi case, the <br />  entire media published all the wrong news for publicity, but <br />whenthe <br />  Justice in Hyderabad high court blasted the media in on PIL and <br />when <br />  the SC blasted the media, TN govt and the laywers for coming up <br />with <br />  a case where there is not even a single evidence against the <br />acharya <br />  in the murder case, no media published it. What will be the mindset <br />  of people who read the papers alone will have?They will surely <br />think <br />  wrong about the acharya and will never know the truth. We should <br />  remember that our countries media is in the hands of the communist <br />  and they are anti-hindu, pro=muslim or pro-christian. They will <br />  publish anything for money. Kanchi case is again a standing example <br />  how our religion is targeted by the christians(its said that <br />foreing <br />  missionaries with the help of sonia is beind this because Jeyendrar <br />  is the only person in thier path who is trying to stop conversion.)</p>
<p>  As Krishna says in Gita, if you think, Hinduism is good it surely <br />is <br />  good, if you think its bad its surely bad. If you look through <br />  coloured glass everything will look coloured. Remove the glass and <br />  look at the facts </p>
<p>  The entire mail is not intended for a single person called Sri, but <br />  to the entire group and if possible to the entire world. -:)</p>

<p>  I could not read the link you sent, because my office interet <br />policy <br />  prohibits some pages based on the meta-tags. I dont know what the <br />  news holds, but I am assured that whatever ill feeling(probably <br />  adhamgam towards our religion) you have towards Hinduism is by <br />  reading news articles in papers etc. Again let me quote you how far <br />  media news are true. SPS very recently pointed out the mistake in <br />  Dina thanthi that the article reg. Aadichanlur kalvettu, misquoted <br />  Ashoka and Maurya dynasty as Akbar and Mughal dynasty. The mass who <br />  read such news will only belive the paper and even if you or I go <br />and <br />  tell them the truth they will not belive. I personally have <br />witnessed <br />  it. When I was doing my MCA, Kumudham came to our university for an <br />  article. They took interview of us and went back.Later whenthe <br />  article was published, whatever I said was published as told by my <br />  classmate, a girl, and whatever i never said were published as if I <br />  told them. oru panai sotrukku oru soru padam. THis is how media <br />plays <br />  with news. Only 30%of what you read is true and if you think them <br />to <br />  be ultimate, I dont have an answer to you. Even in Kanchi case, the <br />  entire media published all the wrong news for publicity, but <br />whenthe <br />  Justice in Hyderabad high court blasted the media in on PIL and <br />when <br />  the SC blasted the media, TN govt and the laywers for coming up <br />with <br />  a case where there is not even a single evidence against the <br />acharya <br />  in the murder case, no media published it. What will be the mindset <br />  of people who read the papers alone will have?They will surely <br />think <br />  wrong about the acharya and will never know the truth. We should <br />  remember that our countries media is in the hands of the communist <br />  and they are anti-hindu, pro=muslim or pro-christian. They will <br />  publish anything for money. Kanchi case is again a standing example <br />  how our religion is targeted by the christians(its said that <br />foreing <br />  missionaries with the help of sonia is beind this because Jeyendrar <br />  is the only person in thier path who is trying to stop conversion.)</p>
<p>  As Krishna says in Gita, if you think, Hinduism is good it surely <br />is <br />  good, if you think its bad its surely bad. If you look through <br />  coloured glass everything will look coloured. Remove the glass and <br />  look at the facts </p>
<p>  The entire mail is not intended for a single person called Sri, but <br />  to the entire group and if possible to the entire world. -:)</p>

          Watch this out....        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Facts check on this post:</p>
<p>"During Tsunami, ofcourse all the ngo's worked. But the first to <br />reach out was RSS who singly contributed to 20% of the total <br />effort." - As someone who lives in excel spreadsheets and runs stat <br />models everyday, I am a little too picky about numbers. 20%? Which <br />means that you have somehow managed to measure the amount of relief <br />that poured in after the tsunami. Something which the UN still hasn't <br />managed to do! Interesting! Can you give us hard numbers - number of <br />people, organizations, places, all verifiable? Please note: I am not <br />questioning that RSS or any other org did relief work. I am sure they <br />did and I'd the first to give them credit for that. The same credit <br />I'd give DYFI workers who did the same work. I only have issues with <br />throwing hard numbers around without any evidence whatsoever!</p>
<p>"Why didnt Hinduism burst if it had suppressions?" - Same logic <br />as 'Slavery never existed as Christainity is still around. There have <br />been stray instances of slavery ofcourse but the Bible never <br />supported it . Its all misrepresentation'. Revolutions are not all <br />swift and bloody.</p>
<p>"I appreciate the western countries and the missionaries a lot. They <br />are great strategists. They are not aiming and immediate conversion. <br />They have a 100 or 1000 year plan, which started 300 years back." - <br />No evidence, no supporting facts. Note again: I know very well how <br />missionaries operate and I am not questioning whether they use <br />underhand tactics(we all know they do). I only have issues with this <br />100/1000 year plans and such conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. RSS/Hindu org. <br />reacted but I dont think they acted at any point of time. Veena, why <br />you are not talking about the godhra carnage but only talk about the <br />hindus burning muslims on the streets? This is the Marxist or rather <br />anti-BJP talks." - Not entirely sure what is Marxist talk! When <br />someone says the answer to violence is not more violence, it does not <br />mean that person is condoning violence on one side. </p>
<p>Veena</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /><satisharun@g...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Over nightla evvalavu mailaaa.......good debate. Welcome back <br />priya, <br />  again with your punch.</p>
<p>  All, I think no one read my mail and understood what I meant, esp. <br />  Veena. If my words gave a different meaning I plead apology. But I <br />  request you to go through it again. I never supported or said <br />RSS/VHP <br />  thier voilence are correct. I only said, dont just take one <br />incident <br />  of babri masjid, see alse the service they render to the society. I <br />  think this point is lost in the ether.</p>
<p>  Veena, during Tsunami, ofcourse all the ngo's worked. But the first <br />  to reach out was RSS who singly contributed to 20% of the total <br />  effort. thats what I stressed. When you criticise them, you should <br />  also appreciate them for their good, if at all you are really <br />  neutral.But all the media highlighted all NGOs but not RSS. Is this <br />  democracy? Is this secularism? Thats what I tried to pointed out, <br />but <br />  you see only in your view, stamping them to be extremists.</p>
<p>  I think Samptha, Priya, and others have given valuable points,which <br />I <br />  need not ponder again. I wrote this earlier, but since veena <br />pointed <br />  out the burining of people on the streets of gujarat, I say this.<br />  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. RSS/Hindu org. <br />  reacted but I dont think they acted at any point of time. Veena, <br />why <br />  you are not talking about the godhra carnage but only talk about <br />the <br />  hindus burning muslims on the streets? This is the Marxist or <br />rather <br />  anti-BJP talks. Its Gujrat communal clash, not a genocide. Communal <br />  clash means both communities suffer. If muslims weer burnt on the <br />  street, hindus should also would have burned on the streets. Its <br />only <br />  that the mediat didnt publish it and published anti-hindu news <br />alone. <br />  You are learned, try to think logically. If 2000 people die in a <br />  communal class, 50% on each side means 1000 hindus also died. <br />simple <br />  arithmatic, right? Btw, I am not supporting what the Hindus did, <br />nor <br />  support violence. I am just questioning, why you people talk only <br />  anti-hindu and are not neutral, why you dont condemn godhra <br />  carnage,but only condemn hindu acts alone...you need not answer me <br />  nor I expect an answer. Please try to answer yourSELF.</p>
<p>  Veena, actually I wrote the words like, you have all the <br />  qualifications to become a politician, and then thought it might <br />hurt <br />  you and erased it. But I fell laughing when you said I have all the <br />  qualification to be a RSS person. Thanks for the compliment and in <br />  your words, I feel proud to get such a complement.If you have read <br />my <br />  last words of the mail, I clearly stated that the Hindu org never <br />  asked others to quit, but only pleading for the peaceful <br />  cooexistence. When its denied, as sampath stated, they emotionally <br />  turn to violence.</p>
<p>  Dear Sri, your points are valid. I have never read the manusmrithi <br />  and so cant comment on it. But my feeling is if such bad things are <br />  there in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism would have swept away <br />  Hinduism. You yourself said, inspite of all invasion,culture or <br />  imperial, Hinduism survived. If many bad things were there, how <br />come <br />  it survived. I feel its the misinterpretation of facts. Probably I <br />am <br />  wrong, but I live it to you to think. If Hinduism is so bad, how <br />come <br />  its surviving from time immemorial. Suppression will alwasy lead to <br />  revolution. Frech Revolution, Boston Tea party, breaking of the <br />USSR <br />  etc. etc. We dont have any such instances in our country. If people <br />  were suppressed in the name of caste(I do accept there might be <br />stray <br />  instances but we should not brand with stray instances)surely they <br />  should have revolted long back.Just give a thought.I am trying to <br />  thing logically. If you compress a baloon it will surely burst. Why <br />  didnt Hinduism burst if it had suppressions? </p>
<p>  Supreme court has given judgement sometime back that only <br />minorities <br />  can open institutions.Whats wrong in admitting only FC in an <br />  institution, if all other religion and other castes have their own <br />  institution. I am hearing this for the first time. Where will the <br />  FC's go if they cant get admission in the name of reservation? Why <br />  dont you point out that minority institutions admit only <br />minorities. <br />  Dont say they also admit Hindus, it will happen only if you have <br />high <br />  recomendation. I studied in Loyola college chennai and I know their <br />  admission procedure. If you had said that all institutions should <br />  admit based on merit or the govt. prescribed reservation policy I <br />  would have been happy. But pointing out one institution which <br />admits <br />  FCs, when the country is flooded with 1000s of minority <br />institutions <br />  and jathi based instititutions admitting their clan, your point <br />  looses its base.</p>
<p>  Re. Christian institutions converting. I appreciate the western <br />  countries and the missionaries a lot. They are great strategists. <br />  They are not aiming and immediate conversion. They have a 100 or <br />1000 <br />  year plan, which started 300 years back. They started by slowing <br />  getting involved in social activities, setting up schools, colleges <br />  etc.by which they can infiltrate the society. Today celebrating <br />  birthdays by cutting cakes (I think we Hindus only go by <br />natchatiram <br />  and not by date..), celebrating christmas, new year, valentines <br />  day,mothers day, fathers day, etc etc. the influence of christian <br />  life style. Though we had all these in our culture itself, we <br />adopted <br />  western culture. Without our knowledge we lost our culture. Once <br />  culture is lost, its easy to break the religion. Well planned, well <br />  executed converson strategy, which is still going on. But on the <br />  outset we cant find it out. I am sure you will criticize me for <br />this <br />  saying I am going nuts thinking crazy, but I seriously think in <br />this <br />  angle, which is agreat threat to our society. So we cant blindly <br />  say, christians run schools just for the societies cause.It has its <br />  own internal agenda. Why should a school have a church inside? <br />every <br />  christian school will have a church and you should be knowing it. <br />If <br />  only education is their motto why church inside the premisis?</p>
<p>  I am wondering, if in such a small group itself, talking in favour <br />of <br />  Hindus is fanatism what about at the country level...my god..</p>
<p>  Such debates can never end, and no one cn change others opinions. <br />But <br />  being humans we should be able to correct oursleves, by <br />retrospecting <br />  and knowing what is right and what is wrong. Let it be you or <br />me...we <br />  should not just go by the band wagon effect.If my views are wrong I <br />  am alwasy ready to change.......</p>

        <p>Dear Sundar<br />Thank you for drawing our attention to this article It did highlight a few things I believe</p>
<p>In Person </p>
<p>Monday, March 14, 2005<br />--  <br />&#145;Everyone has the right to be ignorant&#146; </p>
<p>Sri Sri Ravi Shankar offers a counterpoint to Javed Akhtar&#146;s finite views on spirituality</p>
<p>It is funny that in a country like India spirituality is talked about as a hoax. How can something which is so obvious, which is part of millions of people, be taken as a hoax? Spirituality is not a halo of the few, it is the breath of every human being. Have people forgotten that freedom was achieved through spirituality as the prime means by Mahatma Gandhi? <br />But there are people who question the integrity of MKG<br />Spirituality is intoxicating. Only those who step into it will know. Before criticising we need to do our homework. Has one visited ashrams, like the Ramakrishna Ashram, Ananda Mayi Ma Mutt, Brahma Kumaris&#146;, Gayatri Parivar, Pandurang Shastri, Sri Aurobindo Ashram or Art of Living? Has one spent time with saints? Only then does one&#146;s views carry weight, else they remain simple accusations only, a distorted perception, not reality. <br />Thats very true<br />Blaming the entire modern-day spiritual guru and sadhu community is as foolish as branding the entire Muslim community as terrorists. <br />Thats my point<br />It is the medieval brahmanical mindset to always put down business and politics and the colonial mindset to denounce gurus. As a result we never expanded our political influence nor globalised our business until very recently. <br />Spirituality is not a matter of the head, it is a matter of the heart. I had two choices: to argue and turn the conclave into a conflict or to keep silence. I chose the latter.</p>

<blockquote><p>  ******(There is a belief that Christ visited india during his lost <br />years learned sanathana dharma and preached it and thats what is <br />  Christianity...Theres also claims he sired some children and there <br />  are peope who claim they are decsendents of christ  )*******</p></blockquote>
<p>No sampath that was not refuting you it was just a statement which i heard somewhere...Infact Rushdie references it in his midnights Children though I must confess that I did not finish the book</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Sridhar,</p>
<p>For your information,</p>
<p>"www.dalitstan.org"</p>
<p>used to be registered under the name of "Steve" or some name<br />(non-indian), when i tried to get that info. now, it looks like they<br />now changed it into "dalitstan", no other credible information.. </p>
<p>It's easy to create any website and write all kinda stuff.. Our duty<br />is to see through the motives. I'm NOT saying there was and is not any<br />discrimination.. But it looks like you are beating an already "dead"<br />horse further.. No one I talk to (atleast publicly) defend<br />"manusmriti" (except the kanchi mutt's website) as it is.. We have to<br />fight what we see being practised now, (like the "2 tumbler" system<br />and other evils etc..) not what's been written in "manusmriti" /<br />"uttara kaanda" etc.. And those books don't carry the relevance like a<br />quran or a bible..</p>
<p>Also, we have to get ourselves disabused of the notion that other<br />religions are egalitarian etc.. I was of the same opinion before..<br />You'd be amazed to see the degree of bigotry preached in quran towards<br />non-believers/ women / prisoners of war etc.... I believe we can find<br />similar stuff in bible too..</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />Naren.</p>

<p>----------------- I dont understand one logic.Now in pakistan <br />and iraq shia muslims are murdered in cold blood by sunni <br />muslims.Does any single person in the world say that islam is <br />responsible for these murders?Catholics and protestants murder each <br />other in north ireland.Are jesus and bible responsible for this?</p>
<p>Have we heard a single shia muslim in iraq <br />starting websites as shiasthan.org and blaming islam for murder of <br />shias?Does a single christian blame jesus for murder of protestants <br />in ireland?</p>
<p>Martin luther king the champion of blacks <br />in USA,did he blame jesus for enslavement of blacks?Did nelson <br />mandela blame jesus for apartheid in south africa?</p>
<p>WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE BLAME HINDUISM FOR <br />RAPES DONE BY ANIMALS AND THUGS?People who rape are called <br />as "pancha ma pathagars" by hinduism.They are promised burning hell <br />in "yamalog".Nobody can condemn rape more harsh than this.</p>
<p>So why blame hinduism for rapes in bihar?<br />Blame laloo,rabri and manmohan.But why hindusim??????why?</p></sridhar_rathinam@y...></p>

        <p>that was a wonderful <br />argument mr.sampath.<br />Dr.Rathnam sir, these arguments never ends because all<br />are human despite of any religion and too err is<br />human.<br />so instead of sleddging each other i would like to say<br />that we should try to love each other or atleast<br />co-exhists with each other and do something for the<br />upliftment of the needy with out playing a blame game.<br />my simplest policy is if you belive in god then it<br />shall be with yourself do not force it to others.<br />because only scientific factors can be able to prove<br />by producing evidences. but regarding religion it is<br />wholely a sentiment issue [ sorry nan<br />yethupesiyiruntha].<br />rgds<br />s.anandanatarajan </p>

<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>Dear Dr.Rathnam,</p>
<p>First of all I am happy that you raised these issues<br />in this <br />forum.Because some of your concerns are genuine-like<br />the caste and <br />varnas.Some views of yours can be viewed with a<br />different mindset.</p>
<p>** Mother theresa looking after the the poor in<br />calcattu was to <br />convert people probably right but she did look after<br />people as well</p>
<p>CMC's charity and adoptation schemes have christian<br />names ofcourse <br />sir why do you orphan good hindu off springs because<br />you listen to <br />idiotic banter like lets give birth to three<br />children....and leave <br />them in the street you dont look at the way they are<br />sorted with <br />education and shelter...</p>
<p>Hindus giving birth to many children<br />is a result of <br />ignorance,unawareness and poverty.If they want to help<br />us that <br />should not come at the cost of our heritage and<br />culture.In <br />orphanages these children are converted and thrown out<br />at age of <br />15.If such things happen in USA,there will be a hue<br />and cry.We only <br />point out this anamoly,which any citizen can do.They<br />do a good job <br />in helping these children,but calling it as "selfless<br />service" and <br />giving nobel prizes isnt correct is what I feel.Call<br />it a religious <br />service.Does religious service deserve nobel prize?</p>
<p>****Read Manusmrithi.....Its the literature apparently<br />written by <br />manu for his offsprings...Manu is the first human in<br />hindu <br />mythology.....It tells about all the different kinds<br />panishments to <br />be meated on sudras for even listenng to vedas....When<br />was it <br />written I dont know...Who wrote it I dont know but<br />even african <br />american organisations and cults claim that was the<br />mother of Racism <br />and apartheid and slavery...</p>
<p>Verses from Bible</p>
<p>(Colossians 3: 22-24): "Slaves, obey your earthly<br />masters in <br />everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on<br />you and to win <br />their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence<br />for the Lord. <br />Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as<br />working for the <br />Lord, not for men, since you know that you will<br />receive an <br />inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord<br />Christ you are <br />serving."</p>
<p>"When you buy a Hebrew slave, six years shall he<br />serve; and in the <br />seventh shall he go out free, for nothing. If he came<br />in by himself, <br />he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then<br />his wife shall <br />go out with him. If his master has given him a wife,<br />and she has <br />borne him sons or daughters, the wife and the children<br />shall be her <br />master's, and he shall go out by himself. And if the<br />slave shall <br />plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my<br />children; I will not <br />go out free: then his master shall bring him unto God,<br />and he shall <br />bring him to the door or unto the door-post, and his<br />master shall <br />bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his<br />slave forever."</p>
<p>&#151;Exodus 21:2-6.</p>
<p>"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and<br />trembling, with a <br />sincere heart, as you would Christ, not by the way of<br />eye-service, <br />as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the<br />will of God <br />from the heart."</p>
<p>&#151;Ephesians 6:5-6.</p>
<p>If I give verses in quaran on slavery,"treatment" of<br />captured women <br />it will be endless.Every religion has mud in its face<br />regarding <br />racism.Why single out and blame hinduism alone?</p>
<p>If dalits want to go to a religion which did not<br />promote racism and <br />slavery the only religion they can go is<br />buddhism.Other religions <br />accusing hindus of casteism as if they are perfect and<br />holy is <br />laughable.</p>
<p>****** </p>
<blockquote><p>  But is it what is practiced....Of all the people who<br />are not </p></blockquote>
<p>muslims and christians and buddists and jains we<br />collectively <br />callthem Hindus....How many are not allowed to enter<br />Temples...? Do <br />we call ayyanar and karuppu sami as hindu deities or<br />not....Why they <br />were created by people who couldnt go to temples and<br />enter them</p>
<p>These issues are there in every religion.Women are not<br />allowed to <br />enter mosques in India.Mary is accepted as god by<br />catholics,but <br />whereas protestants vehemently oppose it.Dan brown<br />wrote that <br />earlier christians worshipped mary magdhalene but<br />pastors did not <br />like it,since she was a female and made her as a<br />prostitute.History <br />is abound with examples of blacks not being allowed<br />entry into <br />american churches.</p>
<p>Timothy 2:12"Let a woman learn in silence in all<br />subjection; but I <br />do not permit the woman to teach, neither to rule over<br />the man, but <br />to be in silence." </p>
<p>St. Thomas Aquinas, "As regards the individual nature,<br />woman is <br />defective and misbegotten, for the active force in the<br />male seed <br />tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the<br />masculine sex; <br />while the production of woman comes from a defect in<br />the active <br />force or from some material indisposition, or even<br />from some <br />external influence." <br />(source:http://www.creatormagazine.com/articles/default.asp?<br />arttopicid=196&amp;selid=1&amp;topicid=27&amp;level=3)</p>
<p>now what?This is a universal problem which persists in<br />every <br />religion.</p>
<p>Why blame hinduism alone is my question?</p>
<p>as jesus said "Let those religions who dint sin throw<br />stones at <br />hinduism"</p>
<p>regards<br />sampath</p>

          Watch this out....        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>I never said the westerners wrote the sanskrit text, I only said <br />that they wrote most of the bhashyams, ie. the urai (like the konar <br />tamil urai,what we call urai in english...krupa dont say saraya urai <br />is saraya packet... -:) ).</p>
<p>Re. the example of burning house. You are mistaken. I am not at all <br />saying that I will sit and watch my house burning. I too am like you <br />trying to stop it. But I say its my home sweet home, I want to save <br />it. I dont want a beautiful bunglow than this, my small hut is more <br />than enough for me.Because I very well know I will loose my peace of <br />mind if i get a bunglow which is just maya. Banks come to give me <br />loan and convince me to get a better bunglow for a loan,but I say I <br />dont want to get into debt and I am happy with my small hut. Its none <br />of the banks business to preach me to build a bunglow if I stay in a <br />hut. If I want I will approach them. If my small hut is burning, I am <br />trying to stop it and thats why I am writing all these. If there are <br />misinterpreations, ie. the fire, please get it clear. But you say <br />that the house has all article which are flamable and hence the house <br />itself is wrong and we should quit the house itself and should not <br />have anything inside the house. On the contrary you also say that I <br />am watching my neighbours house burning vigourously. Again <br />miscommunication. I am not sure, whether I am not writing up to the <br />point, or you are not getting it right...I will surely learn to make <br />it more clear.</p>
<p>What ever you say, peoples life was much peaceful before the <br />scientific inventions. If given a CHOICE, I prefer the olden days of <br />life style. Scientific inventions, ie. maya, the comforts are the <br />rootcause of all the evils in current days world. If you are not <br />accepting it, you are cheating yourself. Only for money, only for <br />comfort, todays man is becoming an animal. Without all these gizmos, <br />the output of science, what will man do with money? So when there is <br />no need for money, peace is sure to stay. </p>
<p>As Rajini says in Muthu,"kaiyil konjam kaasu erundhal neethan adharku <br />ejamanan. Kazhuthu varaikum kaasu erundhal adhuthan unakku ejamanan." <br />today we are slaves to money, thanks to the scienfic inventions.<br />I think I am deviating to philosophy from religion.</p>
<p>Again let me request you, just because we have flammable material in <br />the house, dont say that the House itself is wrong. The house will <br />surely contain flammable and non flammable items. Its our <br />responsibility to keep the fire away from the flammable items and <br />thats why I am requesting you. Dont go behind the misinterpreations <br />of fire. And I said only 30% of the news items are correct and if you <br />want to belive in all the nonsense they tell, its your choice. You <br />yourself accepted earlier that Aryan invasion theory is a myth, which <br />was discussed inthis group earlier. The communist and the Dravidian <br />ideologist still hold it dear to them. Mudhal konal mutrum konal. <br />When their base itself is wrong, whatever they interpret about our <br />religion is also wrong.Please dont fall into their traps. Thats whay <br />I am trying to say. Lets try to keep the fire away from us, instead <br />of throwing away the flammable things we have, which are of great <br />importance to us.</p>

<p>My view point is similar sampath Let us sort ourselves first before <br />throwing stones at others..</p>
<p>There is a belief that Christ visited india during his lost years <br />learned sanathana dharma and preached it and thats what is <br />Christianity...Theres also claims he sired some children and there <br />are peope who claim they are decsendents of christ  </p>
<p>I am being the devils advocate because The minute you see things with <br />a thich mindset you loose all reasoning capacity like hitler's ideals</p>

        <p>Dear Satish<br />Thanks for the open letter to Sri!!! <br />There are two view points Satish....If I know my house is burning trying to stop it burning....Or Just sit tight and watch it saying but my neighbours house is burning even more vigourously....I take the first view point you choose the later...<br />If you believe all that is read and taught and written was all western invention and we were impeccable before that these westerners must really be great writters of sanskrit!!!<br />Because they have added Uthara Kandam....They have written manusmrithi....and so and and so forth.....<br />If you choose to believe it thats your choice...<br />May be we should go back to the days of olai suvadi and gurukulam and throw our computers and books out through the window....they are western inventions infact even a child knows that the spead of liberalised form of christianity..French and russian revelution were all possible only because of invention of printing press and paper...<br />we have had some very nice discussions on Sivalingam in our archives Visit them....One of the theories was it was the symbol of unity with the male phalus and the female organ symbolising creation...the ultimate truth is creation of a new life and thats what it simbolises...<br />Intersting concept of the horizon but inwhich case the lingam must be semilunar not cylindrical???is my physics correct? but thats a very nice concept after all we are talking about the 'adiyum mudiyum kaana mudiyatha paramporul.....'The concept equating it to wasteness is great...</p>
<p>The link was nothing but a coleection of articles on different papers and media....But it shouldnt matter to you because all it is what was written by anti hindu media!!!!</p>
<p>As Krishna says in Gita, if you think, Hinduism is good it surely is good, if you think its bad its surely bad. If you look through <br />coloured glass everything will look coloured. Remove the glass and <br />look at the facts <br />Thats exactly what I am saying Satish and sampath accept our religion as it is rather than saying people have misinterpreted it its great...<br />Nobody denies that Hinduism is a great way of life   Read it carefully A way of life.....But to claim its not been polluted and adultrated by lesser mortals is ....Not using the brain we have been given....</p>
<p>I know the value of my religion and I also know of the changes and corruptions it has undergone by various forces...<br />Which are here to stay My voice is to change that but if you feel no we love it as it is....Thats fine...</p>
<p>Thats freedom by choice!!!</p>
<p>The entire mail is not intended for a single person called Sri, but <br />to the entire group and if possible to the entire world. -:)</p>
<p>Never mind satish even if it was intended for me thats fine<br />Regards,</p>
<p>SR</p>

          Watch this out....        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Again I am wondering, how the westerners and our own people with <br />vested interest have spoiled our minds. Translations for vedas were <br />first written by the westerners. Sanskirt like other language, has <br />words which gives many meanings for the same words. Every sloka can <br />be interpreted in several ways. Westerners took only the wrong <br />meaning and spread it to the uneducated mass only to convert them and <br />still we people are following those bashyams as the original bashyam <br />for vedas. </p>
<p>Sampath has thrown much light on this. Cho is writing an article in <br />Tuqlaq titled "Hindu Maha Samudram" which is a must read for all, in <br />which he ponders all these topics. Before three hundered years, <br />people were happy and peaceful without much discrimination. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's <br />Talicheri kalvettu is a standing proof for this. The Tanjai pictures <br />clearly show that even queens did not wear upper garments in those <br />days. We have historic proof for all the equalities we had in the past<br />(again talicheri kalvettu is the standing example where a King <br />respects even the kadai nilai oozhiyan). But only after the europeans <br />entered India all the confusion started. And we got corrupted in our <br />minds and blindly follow what they told to confuse us. This weakness <br />is what they are using for conversion, and thats what I am repeatedly <br />trying to stress.But ....</acronym></p>
<p>The open letter was funny enough to read. Sampath has torn it apart. <br />Any christian or muslim can very well have written that letter in <br />disguise to tarnish Hindus image? can you prove me wrong??...</p>
<p>Sri talks about all the wrong things Manusmrithi talks about..Again I <br />say i have not read manusmrithi. But if at all the scriptures define <br />treatment to different varnas(I dont accept the caste based system, <br />it was only varna dharma), the same scriptures also say that what <br />deed of each varna will lead them to moksha..</p>
<p>A brahmin has to get up early, do his daily routines like <br />sandhyavandhanam, do pooja, do yagnja, chant vedas the whole day and <br />should always be doing all these for the welfare of the society. Its <br />scientifically proven what impact the environment has when vedas are <br />chanted and yagams are done. They should not posses any wealth, apart <br />from their next time meal. These rituals will take the whole day and <br />brahmins has to do all this throughout their life to attain moksha. <br />It goes in the descending order and for sudhras its more than enough <br />if they utter the lords name once, just once a day , to attain <br />moksha. Why my dear friend Sri is not looking at this point? </p>
<p>Re. Misinterpreation of vedas et all..I read on article written by <br />some vested interest in Islam. It goes like this. We Hindus pray lord <br />shiva in the form of 'Lingam'. We all dont realise the basics behind <br />our religion and thats our weakness. Lingam is called Aroopa Roopam , <br />the formless form. People like Benny hin will call Hindus as <br />prostitutes because we do Idol worship and the so called seculars <br />will clap happily for this. Hinduism says the higest form of god, the <br />Brahmam does not have any form and Lingam symbolises it. Then why <br />such a semi circular (to some extent) form is given to LIngam? <br />Anywhere in this universe, if we stand in any place and look above <br />us, the area which our eyes can see is only a hemisphere above us and <br />if you can visualise, thats nothing but the form of Lingam and thats <br />why shiva is given that formless form.</p>
<p>COming to the article (misinterpreation) I read. It seems Lingam has <br />another meaning in Sanskrit. It denotes the male sexual organ. The <br />article claims that Hindus are perverted and enjoy sexuality and <br />thats why we have given the form of the male sexual organ to our god <br />Shiva. And we happily name our children as Ramalingam(Rama's ----) <br />Sundaralingam (Beautiful ---).. etc. Any sane person who knows about <br />Hinduism will laugh at this. Does this make any sense? Probably for <br />the poeople who go by the western/communist/Dravidian ideologies will <br />accept this and say Hinduism is all bullshit..</p>
<p>Dr.Sri, whatever you quote about manusmrithi or the discrimination <br />among the people refered in the scriptures etc. only reminded me of <br />the above said artilce. I dont want to write this, but I needed an <br />example to clear some of the misinterpreation you have. Any person <br />who is against hinduism could have written the bashyam for the <br />scripts which you could have read. That doesnt make the end of it. <br />Thats what I repeatedly say, we have brains to think and we should <br />think logically. Stray incidents do not make what Hinduism actually <br />is. Please Please Please try to understand this.</p>
<p>I could not read the link you sent, because my office interet policy <br />prohibits some pages based on the meta-tags. I dont know what the <br />news holds, but I am assured that whatever ill feeling(probably <br />adhamgam towards our religion) you have towards Hinduism is by <br />reading news articles in papers etc. Again let me quote you how far <br />media news are true. SPS very recently pointed out the mistake in <br />Dina thanthi that the article reg. Aadichanlur kalvettu, misquoted <br />Ashoka and Maurya dynasty as Akbar and Mughal dynasty. The mass who <br />read such news will only belive the paper and even if you or I go and <br />tell them the truth they will not belive. I personally have witnessed <br />it. When I was doing my MCA, Kumudham came to our university for an <br />article. They took interview of us and went back.Later whenthe <br />article was published, whatever I said was published as told by my <br />classmate, a girl, and whatever i never said were published as if I <br />told them. oru panai sotrukku oru soru padam. THis is how media plays <br />with news. Only 30%of what you read is true and if you think them to <br />be ultimate, I dont have an answer to you. Even in Kanchi case, the <br />entire media published all the wrong news for publicity, but whenthe <br />Justice in Hyderabad high court blasted the media in on PIL and when <br />the SC blasted the media, TN govt and the laywers for coming up with <br />a case where there is not even a single evidence against the acharya <br />in the murder case, no media published it. What will be the mindset <br />of people who read the papers alone will have?They will surely think <br />wrong about the acharya and will never know the truth. We should <br />remember that our countries media is in the hands of the communist <br />and they are anti-hindu, pro=muslim or pro-christian. They will <br />publish anything for money. Kanchi case is again a standing example <br />how our religion is targeted by the christians(its said that foreing <br />missionaries with the help of sonia is beind this because Jeyendrar <br />is the only person in thier path who is trying to stop conversion.)</p>
<p>As Krishna says in Gita, if you think, Hinduism is good it surely is <br />good, if you think its bad its surely bad. If you look through <br />coloured glass everything will look coloured. Remove the glass and <br />look at the facts </p>

        <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Here impression is being created as if group(caste)<br />discrimination existed/exists only in India (hinduism)</p>
<p>Even now in England, some of the protestant schools do<br />not admit catholics. There were big fights between<br />these groups. One group could not enter other group's<br />area for some time.</p>
<p>In Pak &amp; Iraq, shia &amp; sunny muslims do not interact.<br />Ahmadia group muslims are untouchable by majority Shia<br />&amp; sunny muslims in Pak.</p>
<p>Even in our own land, so called christianity have not <br />brought mingling of christian nadars with SC<br />christians. christian nadars consider SC christians as<br />untouchable. There was a procession some years ago in<br />Trichy by SC christians for the maltreatment by church<br />&amp; other christians.</p>
<p>If caste abolition is prime objective of christianity,<br />then why they are christian nadars, christian<br />vanniyars,christian pillaimars,SC christians. How<br />church allows this. So castiesm is just a scape goat<br />for conversion. Once he is converted to christianity,<br />church is least bothered about so called " equality"</p>
<p>In south Africa, colour discrimination is still there<br />among same religious groups</p>
<p>Why a Pope could not come from asia or african<br />countries so far?</p>
<p>Bye<br />MA Eswaran</p>

        <p>Answer to the open letter</p>
<p>" The higher caste rulers of our area, when they visited our <br />dwellings, pointed out that the women had to go to their abodes for <br />their enjoyment. It so happened that in one place, after pointing <br />out the women they needed for that day's enjoyment, they found out <br />on returning home that the women of their choice were not sent to <br />their abode for their enjoyment. The people of that locality had <br />decided to disobey the dictate of the higher caste. This angered the <br />rulers, and they invoked the Manu Sasthra and its associate <br />scriptures and meted out severe punishments in the following ways <br />using the following principles:"</p>
<p>-------------- Very funny.Accusing the mistakes of <br />hindu kings and jamindars on hinduism is not fair.Akbar mainatined a <br />harem of 5000 women,whereas islam asked him to limit his wives to <br />4.Is islam to be blamed for akbar's harem?In earlier days kings and <br />zamindars of all countries raped poor women.Why blame hinduism and <br />vedas for acts of kings?Is anywhere in vedas it is mentioned that <br />low caste women should visit the harems of higher caste people?<br />Please show.</p>
<p>****** For Brahmins (Aryans): A Brahmin is the shape of dharma. The <br />Brahmin who explains dharma reaches the glory of knowledge. . . . <br />The Brahmin has been created as the first of all the creation to <br />safeguard and execute the socio-religio ethical laws imposed on <br />man. . . . The Brahmin is the first-born and of higher birth. <br />Because of this privilege, a Brahmin is eligible to claim all wealth <br />created by Brahma as his. (Manu, introduction) If a Brahmin gets a <br />buried treasure, all of it will belong to him. Because a Brahmin is <br />of higher stature, it should be taken into consideration that such <br />treasures had been gathered of yore by self; and if a king gets a <br />treasure, he should keep half of it and distribute the rest to the <br />Brahmins. (Manu 8:100) Even if a Brahmin is doing menial work, he <br />should be worshiped. (Prasara Smirthi 8:33)</p>
<p>-------- Again misleading.Bhramana means <br />saint,rishi,a stature which can be achieved by any caste.Such a <br />saint has to live only by "unjavrudhi" that is begging.Bhramins <br />cannot have lands and cannot cultivate.They can live only by <br />begging.what will a bhramin do with wealth?saint vidyaranya got huge <br />wealth.He gave it to harihara,bukka to create vijayanagar <br />empire.Vasihsta had kamadenu which could give him everything.He only <br />used it to do "adithi pooja".Wealth to bhramins is meaningless.Its <br />like giving chicken 65 to a goat.Good,but useless.</p>
<p>******* For Shudrans (Dravidians): Lead should be boiled and poured <br />into the two ears of the Shudran who listens to the scriptures. A <br />Shudran is equal to a burning ghat, and thus, scripture recital <br />should not be done near him. (Brahmasuthra 1-3-38)</p>
<p>----- shudrans=dravidians is nice imagination.Rahuldravid is <br />bhramin.Is he a sudhra?Manudharma and bhramsuthra are not vedic <br />scriptures.Vedas and bharatha and ramayana only are authentic.Rest <br />all are later day inclusions.Show from any vedas that they call for <br />pouring hot iron into sudhras ears?</p>
<p>*******Our women were forbidden by law to wear upper garments, or <br />blouses, before the reputed upper castes.</p>
<p>Show the quotes in vedas for this.Even today <br />in madurai old thevar women,ksathriyas dont wear blouses.It was <br />custom in those days.</p>
<p>*******Boys reaching the age of maturity had to pay a beard and <br />moustache tax.</p>
<p>moustache and beard tax was levied by peter the <br />great of russia.It is news to me that it happened in India.Can you <br />shopw vedic scriptures asking sudras to pay moustache tax?</p>
<p>*****Girls reaching the age of maturity had to pay a breast tax. The <br />tax collectors will come and measure the upcoming breast and tax <br />accordingly. It is recorded in history that a girl cut off one of <br />her breasts and gave it to the tax collector as a gift as she could <br />not put up with the molestation of the tax collector.</p>
<p>------- Looks like shakeela movie story to me.can you give <br />evidence to this?Which kings rule did this happen?During british <br />period many zamindars ruled country and had funny laws.But again <br />what had that to do with hinduism?Show the scriptural evidence for <br />this in vedas please.which vedas ask women to pay breast tax?</p>
<p>********Our women were abused as much as possible, which can be <br />inferred from the following saying: It is sin to look at the modesty <br />of the cow whereas it is the birthright of the upper caste to gaze <br />at the naked modesty of the lower caste women and enjoy.</p>
<p>----------------- even upper caste women wore no blouse during <br />those days.Even today in south and west TN old women dont wear <br />blouse,in all castes.</p>
<p>******* We were people who were untouchable only as far as the caste <br />system was concerned. The upper castes could not eat or drink from <br />the same plate or tumbler that we use. We were treated with <br />inhumanity. But when it came to raping or touching or enjoying our <br />women, by some miracle, the bug of untouchability did not defile the <br />upper castes, which otherwise would be defiled even if an <br />Untouchable stood very close to them. The coming of Christian <br />missionaries and their revulsion to seeing bare-breasted women <br />wandering around them almost naked began the process of our <br />transformation.</p>
<p>Rape is universal across all cultures and <br />civilizations.As far as rich raping poor is concerned,it happened <br />all over the world.christioan missionaries came to India in 17th <br />century when ships carrying cargo of african slaves were plying to <br />USA and Europe.Its very funny to claim that they liberated dalits <br />while they enslaved africans.</p>
<p>*******It took 37 years of struggle for us from May 1822 to July 26, <br />1859, to break out of this exploitation in a revolution called the <br />Upper Cloth Revolts, supported by Christian missionaries and finally <br />government legislation to free them of this indecent life.</p>
<p>-----  And it took 7 more years after this "liberation war"--<br />that is in 1865 there had to be a civil war to liberate blacks in <br />USA.Here atleast you fought for wearing clothes.There they fought to <br />be treated as humans and not animals.So India was ahead by 7 <br />years.whose side were the southern baptist missionaries in the civil <br />war?They were on the slave traders side.</p>
<p>*******Christianity gave us relief from virtual slavery to the Aryan <br />upper caste Nairs who were exploiting us.</p>
<p>------ Very funny.Mohammed ali claimed that Islam gave him <br />freedom from slavery from christians and converted to a muslim in <br />1967.</p>
<p>******** Christianity gave us respectability, and we became the <br />Nadar people.</p>
<p>--------- after becoming christian you still retain the nadar <br />identity.IN TN we have nadar christians,dalit christians,udayar <br />christians....and they have untouchability in churchers,they marry <br />with jathakam and seeing castes etc.</p>
<p>******* My questions to Mr. Sudershan and his brigade of Hindu <br />nationalists are:</p>
<p>Where were our cultural champions of today's India then?</p>
<p>------------ they werent born.</p>
<p>***** Will Hindu cultural nationalism mean that we have to go back <br />to our old enslaved cultural ways?</p>
<p>------- no</p>
<p>******* Since in my present religion I do not have any caste, once <br />you convert me back to Hinduism, will you provide a casteless place?</p>
<p>----- you claim to be a nadar christian and say your religion is <br />casteless.Funny,arent you?</p>
<p>******** What is Hindutva in reality?</p>
<p>------------ are you willing to listen?I can talk for hours on <br />hindutva.</p>
<p>****** Why is it important that only Aryan Brahmins should remain at <br />the top of the caste ladder?</p>
<p>---------- who said so?</p>
<p>******* Why cannot the energy you and your brigade unleash on other <br />religious communities be channelled toward the abolition of the <br />caste system and the peaceful coexistence of all human beings?</p>
<p>---------------- we fight to create a discriminationless <br />society.Help us to achieve that goal.Come and become a hindu.Come <br />back to your home,</p>
<p>******** I have many more questions to ask. If you can give me and <br />my community clear and satisfactory answers, I, along with my <br />bandwagon, are ready to convert into a Hindu to make your goals a <br />success without bloodshed.</p>
<p>----------- ask 1000 questions,awaiting your return to hinduism</p>

          Watch this out....        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>*******In one of the coverages one of the SPs stayed out of the mutt <br />and Periyaval calls him inside and he says that 'Naan Harijan Sami' <br />and Periyaal says 'Oh ippo ellarum varalame'</p>
<p>---- Whats wrong in this?This shows that jayendra <br />accepts that earlier there was discrimination in mutt,but now it has <br />ended.He was honest,was that a mistake?</p>
<p>****** And as Satish is it pointed out The Casteless Peedam also <br />talks of Various castes and creeds thats whats seperating Hinduism <br />and others are exploiting it....</p>
<p>---- It only talks about castes to reform the <br />system.Recently "tada periyasami" dalit met jayendra in <br />mutt,thirumavalavan was called to chidambaram temple by dikshithas <br />and was garlanded.</p>
<p>******Stray incidences of violences to lesser castes said one of the <br />members there were quotes of anniliation of hindus by muslims and <br />british and others but what do you say about this all you need is <br />google.<br /><a href="http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html" title="http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html">http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html</a></p>
<p>----- I have pity for that author of the website.He was <br />a RSS pracharak,from Bihar.His family was murdered by ranveer <br />sena,in Bihar(ranveer sena is bhramins private army.every caste has <br />such armies in bihar.)So he turned against bhramins.While I share <br />his grief,I can refute his website point by point.Also if that <br />unfortunate incident did not happen he would now be defending <br />hinduism.He writes those things because he is angry,not because they <br />are true.</p>
<p>********* Ms Priya repaetedly claims Varna was based on occupation <br />and people were elevated based on purity sincerity and leading a god <br />life claiming valmiki and vyasa were sudras who became brahmans...</p>
<blockquote><p>  But Ekalyva wanted to be a Kshathriya but was refused <br />training....Karna wanted to compete with arjuna and he was refused </p></blockquote>
<p>because of his birth and was crowned angaraja and then <br />participated ....If it was due to valour they were termed <br />Ksakthriyas why did this happen?</p>
<p>--- Vyasa clearly says that it was due to the jealousy <br />of arjuna that these things happened.Arjuna was jealous of ekalavya <br />and begged drona not to teach him.Similiarly karna had a fight with <br />arjuna and arjuna prevented him learning from drona using his <br />influence.Drona listened to arjuna because arjuna had promised him <br />that he will enslave durupatha whom drona despised so badly.</p>
<p>vyasa bharatha clearly elevates ekalavya and says <br />what drona did was wrong.There are many instances of bhramins <br />accepting non-bhramins as disciples. vasishta accepted viswamithra a <br />ksathriya as bhrammarishi and we have saying "vasistar vayal <br />bhrammarishi".smartha Ramdoss accepted shivaji (a dalit) as his <br />disciple.Valmiki and vyasa themselves were dalits.Vyasa fathered <br />trutharasthra and pandu through ksathriya queens ambika and <br />ambalika.So even arjuna was a dalit by birth.Did drona hesitate to <br />accept them as his disciples?</p>
<p>*******We have a better example in the Valmiki Ramayana where there <br />is no such doubt and the motivation is clear. This figures in the <br />Uttarakanda, which is certainly a later interpolation. However, <br />Kalidasa's Raghuvamsha also describes this incident. This was <br />Shambuka, a shudra, who was practicing austerities so as to go to <br />heaven in his physical body. Rama took out his sword and chopped off <br />Shambuka's head. Flowers rained down from heaven. The gods granted <br />boons to Rama and the brahmana's dead son came back to life. By the <br />way, we always remember that Dasharatha was cursed because he <br />inadvertently shot down an ascetic's son. We don't usually remember <br />that this ascetic was not a brahmana. Shambuka phobia is a better <br />expression. </p>
<p>------ With due respects to kalidasa,he himself was a dalit,he was <br />a wood cutter who gained knolwedge due to saraswathi's kruba and <br />married the kings daughter.</p>
<p>Valmiki Ramayan doesnt say anything about utharakanda.It <br />ends with rama being made emperor and ends happily.It isnt there <br />even in kamba ramayana which was blessed by lord narashima <br />himself.There are thousands of ramayana stories where rama and <br />seetha are even depicted as brother and sister,hanuman has a <br />son,mayil ravana, hanuman meets baratha during lankan war etc. </p>
<p>reputed vaishnava peethas and kanchi mutt have only <br />accepted valmiki ramayan as original and vyasa bharatha as <br />original.Utharakanda is not original.</p>

          Watch this out....        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Dr.Rathnam,</p>
<p>First of all I am happy that you raised these issues in this <br />forum.Because some of your concerns are genuine-like the caste and <br />varnas.Some views of yours can be viewed with a different mindset.</p>
<p>** Mother theresa looking after the the poor in calcattu was to <br />convert people probably right but she did look after people as well</p>
<p>CMC's charity and adoptation schemes have christian names ofcourse <br />sir why do you orphan good hindu off springs because you listen to <br />idiotic banter like lets give birth to three children....and leave <br />them in the street you dont look at the way they are sorted with <br />education and shelter...</p>
<p>Hindus giving birth to many children is a result of <br />ignorance,unawareness and poverty.If they want to help us that <br />should not come at the cost of our heritage and culture.In <br />orphanages these children are converted and thrown out at age of <br />15.If such things happen in USA,there will be a hue and cry.We only <br />point out this anamoly,which any citizen can do.They do a good job <br />in helping these children,but calling it as "selfless service" and <br />giving nobel prizes isnt correct is what I feel.Call it a religious <br />service.Does religious service deserve nobel prize?</p>
<p>****Read Manusmrithi.....Its the literature apparently written by <br />manu for his offsprings...Manu is the first human in hindu <br />mythology.....It tells about all the different kinds panishments to <br />be meated on sudras for even listenng to vedas....When was it <br />written I dont know...Who wrote it I dont know but even african <br />american organisations and cults claim that was the mother of Racism <br />and apartheid and slavery...</p>
<p>Verses from Bible</p>
<p>(Colossians 3: 22-24): "Slaves, obey your earthly masters in <br />everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win <br />their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. <br />Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the <br />Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an <br />inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are <br />serving."</p>
<p>"When you buy a Hebrew slave, six years shall he serve; and in the <br />seventh shall he go out free, for nothing. If he came in by himself, <br />he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall <br />go out with him. If his master has given him a wife, and she has <br />borne him sons or daughters, the wife and the children shall be her <br />master's, and he shall go out by himself. And if the slave shall <br />plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not <br />go out free: then his master shall bring him unto God, and he shall <br />bring him to the door or unto the door-post, and his master shall <br />bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever."</p>
<p>?Exodus 21:2-6.</p>
<p>"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a <br />sincere heart, as you would Christ, not by the way of eye-service, <br />as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God <br />from the heart."</p>
<p>?Ephesians 6:5-6.</p>
<p>If I give verses in quaran on slavery,"treatment" of captured women <br />it will be endless.Every religion has mud in its face regarding <br />racism.Why single out and blame hinduism alone?</p>
<p>If dalits want to go to a religion which did not promote racism and <br />slavery the only religion they can go is buddhism.Other religions <br />accusing hindus of casteism as if they are perfect and holy is <br />laughable.</p>
<p>****** </p>
<blockquote><p>  But is it what is practiced....Of all the people who are not <br />muslims and christians and buddists and jains we collectively </p></blockquote>
<p>callthem Hindus....How many are not allowed to enter Temples...? Do <br />we call ayyanar and karuppu sami as hindu deities or not....Why they <br />were created by people who couldnt go to temples and enter them</p>
<p>These issues are there in every religion.Women are not allowed to <br />enter mosques in India.Mary is accepted as god by catholics,but <br />whereas protestants vehemently oppose it.Dan brown wrote that <br />earlier christians worshipped mary magdhalene but pastors did not <br />like it,since she was a female and made her as a prostitute.History <br />is abound with examples of blacks not being allowed entry into <br />american churches.</p>
<p>Timothy 2:12"Let a woman learn in silence in all subjection; but I <br />do not permit the woman to teach, neither to rule over the man, but <br />to be in silence." </p>
<p>St. Thomas Aquinas, "As regards the individual nature, woman is <br />defective and misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed <br />tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; <br />while the production of woman comes from a defect in the active <br />force or from some material indisposition, or even from some <br />external influence." <br />(source:http://www.creatormagazine.com/articles/default.asp?<br />arttopicid=196&amp;selid=1&amp;topicid=27&amp;level=3)</p>
<p>now what?This is a universal problem which persists in every <br />religion.</p>
<p>Why blame hinduism alone is my question?</p>
<p>as jesus said "Let those religions who dint sin throw stones at <br />hinduism"</p>

<p>INDIA: Open Letter: Why Should Dalits Embrace Hindutva?</p>
<p>J. B. Rajeshwar</p>
<p>(Ed. note: This open letter was written to K. S. Sudershan, chief sankalchak (state or regional leader) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), or National Volunteer Corps, and Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the Congress Party, and other members of the People Integration Council. The letter was written in response to Sudershan's call to people of other faiths in India to "return home" to Hinduism. The title was added by the editor.)</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Sudershan,</p>
<p>Of late, you and your bandwagon of associates have been asking all other religious citizens of India to convert to Hinduism so that all of us can have a unified identity called Hindutva instead of being called an Indian citizen by virtue of birth within the boundary of this country. You have also been asserting that there is nothing about this Hindutva identity of which one should be ashamed. I would be grateful if you can clarify my doubts after reading the following history of my people, who had the audacity to liberate themselves from the clutches of the Aryan-imposed caste system on the people of this land.</p>
<p>"Why is it that we, the majority Dravidian mass of this land, should be subservient to your minority Aryan population?" a Dalit asks K. S. Sudershan, a leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), in India, the world's largest democracy. (Photo: Tiane Doan de Champassak, UNESCO)</p>
<p>The higher caste rulers of our area, when they visited our dwellings, pointed out that the women had to go to their abodes for their enjoyment. It so happened that in one place, after pointing out the women they needed for that day's enjoyment, they found out on returning home that the women of their choice were not sent to their abode for their enjoyment. The people of that locality had decided to disobey the dictate of the higher caste. This angered the rulers, and they invoked the Manu Sasthra and its associate scriptures and meted out severe punishments in the following ways using the following principles:</p>
<p>For Brahmins (Aryans): A Brahmin is the shape of dharma. The Brahmin who explains dharma reaches the glory of knowledge. . . . The Brahmin has been created as the first of all the creation to safeguard and execute the socio-religio ethical laws imposed on man. . . . The Brahmin is the first-born and of higher birth. Because of this privilege, a Brahmin is eligible to claim all wealth created by Brahma as his. (Manu, introduction) If a Brahmin gets a buried treasure, all of it will belong to him. Because a Brahmin is of higher stature, it should be taken into consideration that such treasures had been gathered of yore by self; and if a king gets a treasure, he should keep half of it and distribute the rest to the Brahmins. (Manu 8:100) Even if a Brahmin is doing menial work, he should be worshiped. (Prasara Smirthi 8:33)</p>
<p>For Shudrans (Dravidians): Lead should be boiled and poured into the two ears of the Shudran who listens to the scriptures. A Shudran is equal to a burning ghat, and thus, scripture recital should not be done near him. (Brahmasuthra 1-3-38) The tongue of a Shudran who utters the scriptures should be cut and the scriptures taken away from him and the chest that confirmed these scriptures should be split. (Thirumananda Kosambi, Lord Buddha) Without asking him, with force and without hesitation, the house of a Shudran can be looted if he is not content with carrying dirt and has acquired wealth in his house. (Manu, introduction) In whichever nation a Shudran is doing the work of dharma inquiry (justice), the work that should be done by the king of that nation, then the whole nation, as it watches, suffers like a cow caught in a quagmire. (Manu 8:21) A Shudran should not be worshiped even if he is the embodiment of good character. (Prasara Smirthi 8:33)</p>
<p>On the strength of the above, we received our punishment as follows:</p>
<p>Our forefathers were treated worse than slaves.</p>
<p>Our forefathers, both men and women, were forced to wear a long piece of cloth covering only the portion of their bodies from the hips to the knees, exposing all the other body parts for the benefit of the higher castes; called the Nada caste, they were placed at the bottom rung of the caste hierarchy.</p>
<p>Our women were forbidden by law to wear upper garments, or blouses, before the reputed upper castes.</p>
<p>Boys reaching the age of maturity had to pay a beard and moustache tax.</p>
<p>Girls reaching the age of maturity had to pay a breast tax. The tax collectors will come and measure the upcoming breast and tax accordingly. It is recorded in history that a girl cut off one of her breasts and gave it to the tax collector as a gift as she could not put up with the molestation of the tax collector.</p>
<p>We could not own any cattle or chickens; and if upper castes learned of it, they would be confiscated through the rule of law.</p>
<p>We were not allowed to educate ourselves.</p>
<p>Our women were abused as much as possible, which can be inferred from the following saying: It is sin to look at the modesty of the cow whereas it is the birthright of the upper caste to gaze at the naked modesty of the lower caste women and enjoy.</p>
<p>Any lower caste looking at the chastity of the cow should be thrashed with neem sticks, and any lower caste women found wearing an upper cloth should be thrashed with coconut frond sticks.</p>
<p>It was considered an insult to the upper caste women if the lower caste women were to wear an upper cloth, which is the traditional dress of the upper caste women.</p>
<p>We were people who were untouchable only as far as the caste system was concerned. The upper castes could not eat or drink from the same plate or tumbler that we use. We were treated with inhumanity. But when it came to raping or touching or enjoying our women, by some miracle, the bug of untouchability did not defile the upper castes, which otherwise would be defiled even if an Untouchable stood very close to them. The coming of Christian missionaries and their revulsion to seeing bare-breasted women wandering around them almost naked began the process of our transformation.</p>
<p>It took 37 years of struggle for us from May 1822 to July 26, 1859, to break out of this exploitation in a revolution called the Upper Cloth Revolts, supported by Christian missionaries and finally government legislation to free them of this indecent life.</p>
<p>It is a recorded fact that foreigners did not donate one single penny towards the cost of our freedom struggle but only gave us advice and moral support.</p>
<p>Christianity gave us relief from virtual slavery to the Aryan upper caste Nairs who were exploiting us.</p>
<p>Christianity gave us education.</p>
<p>Christianity gave us respectability, and we became the Nadar people.</p>
<p>The liberation attained by the Nada people who became Christians was extended to those sections of society that did not convert to Christianity through another law. This is why we have Hindu and Christian Nadar communities today who are well off and well respected and considered as higher caste people.</p>
<p>Of course, the sad part of our history is that in central Tamil Nadu, even until now, a part of our community is treated with disrespect because of their job as palmyra tree climbers. They are not allowed entry into the main temples. The chest of a palmyra climber will be full of bruises due to the climbing of the trees bare-chested. Consequently, everyone of this area is required to enter the temples bare-chested in order to identify the people who should not be entering the temple.</p>
<p>My questions to Mr. Sudershan and his brigade of Hindu nationalists are:</p>
<p>Where were our cultural champions of today's India then?</p>
<p>Will Hindu cultural nationalism mean that we have to go back to our old enslaved cultural ways?</p>
<p>Since in my present religion I do not have any caste, once you convert me back to Hinduism, will you provide a casteless place?</p>
<p>What is Hindutva in reality?</p>
<p>Why is it important that only Aryan Brahmins should remain at the top of the caste ladder?</p>
<p>Why is it that we, the majority Dravidian mass of this land, should be subservient to your minority Aryan population?</p>
<p>Why cannot the energy you and your brigade unleash on other religious communities be channelled toward the abolition of the caste system and the peaceful coexistence of all human beings?</p>
<p>I have many more questions to ask. If you can give me and my community clear and satisfactory answers, I, along with my bandwagon, are ready to convert into a Hindu to make your goals a success without bloodshed.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Gandhi and others of the People Integration Council,</p>
<p>My questions to you are:</p>
<p>What is the intention of starting this forum?</p>
<p>Will this integration succeed in ending the caste system because, without ending the caste system, integration is not possible?</p>
<p>Is this "People's Integration Council" being created only for political purposes for gathering votes?</p>
<p>You have said that we should be proud of our past cultural history. After reading the above, do you think that I can be proud of my background?</p>
<p>I would be grateful to receive honest answers on behalf of the people for whom you have started this forum.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sriram and others<br />When I mentioned about various things people might think I am defending other peoples actions...We claim we all are hindus I believe I am but do all those out there believe that if so will they have been quiet when a religious leader was arrested in a religious place ......Cannot happen in UK though they know they harbour and promote terrorism mosques have not been violated...<br />The only onstance in Indian histrory has been Operation Bluestar...and Golden temple...<br />But Why did all of the HINDUS not revolt????Do we not care Or Are We oblivious Or Do we think that doesnt matter to us its somebodies business....<br />In one of the coverages one of the SPs stayed out of the mutt and Periyaval calls him inside and he says that 'Naan Harijan Sami' and Periyaal says 'Oh ippo ellarum varalame'<br />And as Satish is it pointed out The Casteless Peedam also talks of Various castes and creeds thats whats seperating Hinduism and others are exploiting it....</p>
<p>Stray incidences of violences to lesser castes said one of the members there were quotes of anniliation of hindus by muslims and british and others but what do you say about this all you need is google.<br /><a href="http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html" title="http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html">http://www.dalitstan.org/holocaust/bharat/idxbhar.html</a></p>
<p>Its a horrifying read....</p>
<p>Ms Priya repaetedly claims Varna was based on occupation and people were elevated based on purity sincerity and leading a god life claiming valmiki and vyasa were sudras who became brahmans...<br />But Ekalyva wanted to be a Kshathriya but was refused training....Karna wanted to compete with arjuna and he was refused because of his birth and was crowned angaraja and then participated ....If it was due to valour they were termed Ksakthriyas why did this happen?</p>
<p>We have a better example in the Valmiki Ramayana where there is no such doubt and the motivation is clear. This figures in the Uttarakanda, which is certainly a later interpolation. However, Kalidasa&#146;s Raghuvamsha also describes this incident. With approval, as in the Ramayana. An old brahmana&#146;s son died and the brahmana thought this untimely death must have been due to a sin Rama had committed. He wanted Rama to bring his dead son back to life. The assembled sages decided that a shudra must have indulged in meditation. This would be permitted in kali yuga, but certainly not in dvapara yuga. Sure enough, to the south of the kingdom, near a large pond, Rama discovered a mendicant hanging upside down from a tree. <br />This was Shambuka, a shudra, who was practicing austerities so as to go to heaven in his physical body. Rama took out his sword and chopped off Shambuka&#146;s head. Flowers rained down from heaven. The gods granted boons to Rama and the brahmana&#146;s dead son came back to life. By the way, we always remember that Dasharatha was cursed because he inadvertently shot down an ascetic&#146;s son. We don&#146;t usually remember that this ascetic was not a brahmana. Shambuka phobia is a better expression. </p>
<p>Just like the current day bigots are doing, there must have been any number of narrow-minded bigots who made it generation-based....<br />And who is it that says that Shudra is an untouchable...?!<br />The word "SHUDRA" is nothing but an anagram of SHUDDA+RUDRA+BHAKTHA....this is the explanation given in one of the commentries on the VEDAS by Vyasa or somebody..I do not recall correctly...<br />But my whole point in my previous point is....why any unneccassary such squabbles amongst us? </p>
<p>So my point is Sriram we have to clear our house first before criticising others we have to have swayamsevaks protecting our women and kids against out fellow hindu atrocities first and then the rest....</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>If you think I am defending what other religious organisations are doing Then You are wrong all I am saying is dont look at everything thru coloured glasses....</p>
<p>Mother theresa looking after the the poor in calcattu was to convert people probably right but she did look after people as well</p>
<p>CMC's charity and adoptation schemes have christian names ofcourse sir why do you orphan good hindu off springs because you listen to idiotic banter like lets give birth to three children....and leave them in the street you dont look at the way they are sorted with education and shelter...</p>
<p>Read Manusmrithi.....Its the literature apparently written by manu for his offsprings...Manu is the first human in hindu mythology.....It tells about all the different kinds panishments to be meated on sudras for even listenng to vedas....When was it written I dont know...Who wrote it I dont know but even african american organisations and cults claim that was the mother of Racism and apartheid and slavery...</p>
<p>Infact Priya herself in an earlier mail had accepted manusasthra was fautlty...</p>
<p>I do agree varna was based on so called profession and the lord sees all as one...</p>
<p>I have referenced a link which Krishna says in Gita how he sees all as one...</p>
<p>But is it what is practiced....Of all the people who are not muslims and christians and buddists and jains we collectively callthem Hindus....How many are not allowed to enter Temples...? Do we call ayyanar and karuppu sami as hindu deities or not....Why they were created by people who couldnt go to temples and enter them</p>
<p>We talk about stray incidents....But all the stray incidents are what made our people dejected...</p>
<p>your points are valid. I have never read the manusmrithi and so cant comment on it. But my feeling is if such bad things are there in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism would have swept away Hinduism. You yourself said, inspite of all invasion,culture or imperial, Hinduism survived. If many bad things were there, how come it survived. </p>
<p>Buddism and jainism did spread like nobodies business Tamilanadu at one time was controlled by jains till there was tamil and hindu revival the samayakuravar and all</p>
<p>I feel its the misinterpretation of facts. Probably I am wrong, but I live it to you to think. If Hinduism is so bad, how come its surviving from time immemorial. </p>
<p>Hinduism was the way of life of the people...Do you get Hinduised to become a hindu?Do you have a holy bath....No we just beleieve in Hinduism...</p>
<p>Suppression will alwasy lead to revolution. Frech Revolution, Boston Tea party, breaking of the USSR etc. etc. We dont have any such instances in our country. If people were suppressed in the name of caste(I do accept there might be stray <br />instances but we should not brand with stray instances)surely they should have revolted long back.Just give a thought.I am trying to thing logically. If you compress a baloon it will surely burst. Why didnt Hinduism burst if it had suppressions? <br />What we see is the result of all that Satish...</p>
<p>Buddist and jain conversions in the past...</p>
<p>christian and islamic convertions in kerala were all mostly in the working class because of the higher caste domination..</p>
<p>Well someone just said whats wrong in each jathi looking after its own in a recent mail</p>
<p>The cake cutting and althat came when our rajahs and british educated people aped a western culture</p>
<p>What will a cobler or fram hand know about nall nathcathram any way?</p>
<p>The Valentines day fathers day and mothers day are aping western cultures</p>
<p>When I left India valentines day cards were found only in Alsa maal and Gemini complex We knew about it in MMC</p>
<p>I recently went to INdian in 2003 My grandmother is wishing happy valentines day</p>
<p>Ads evertwhere buy a watch and get one free for your valentine buy a jeans get a skirt free Cable networks screaming valentine sirappu thiraipadam....Was this conversion no its a young generation aping western currupt culture...</p>
<p>Do you know half the popu;lation in the west atleast Uk dont know Xmas is for Christs Birthday They only know it as a day Santa brings gifts!!!!70% population dont go to churches that they are getting converted to pubs and auditoriums...</p>
<p>To finalise my veiw is as Hindus we have to have a periless hindu society and then think about the other religions offending us</p>
