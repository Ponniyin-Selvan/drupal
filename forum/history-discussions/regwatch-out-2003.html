        <p>Whatever. Criticisms are the only reason any change takes place in <br />any system and thats important to the improvement of that system. If <br />we all sit and say that the ideology has succeeded, lets all keep <br />quiet, nothing will ever come out of it. You yourself cited the right <br />example - Periyar.</p>
<p>Yeah. Outlook's feedback writers all are NRIs, so all NRIs are anti-<br />BJP. Great logic. Thanks for your input. </p>
<p>More factual issues:"Also BJP doesnt get vote in backward states.It <br />gets votes in GOA,karnataka,delhi,mumbai,gujarat,maharashtra,punjab-<br />hardly backward states" - I don't see how one can call these states <br />forward and all else backward. Also, you would also want to check how <br />many of them are actually ruled by the BJP.</p>
<p>Thanks for your thoughts Priya. But I am going to have end this <br />conversation here as I believe we know exactly where each other <br />stand. And the more I read caste-loaded statements, the more I think <br />there's no common point for us to maintain a conversation. Thanks <br />again and have a nice day!</p>

<p>    Priya,<br />  Ofcourse, I do not agree(I cannot see how anyone could) that just <br />  because an idea is successful(for certain definitions of the word <br />  success), the criticisms against it can be called meaningless but <br />  then again, thats your view. Cool. </p>
<p>  Reply:My definition for success is acceptance by <br />the <br />  concerned group.Criticisms going meaningless means that the purpose <br />  of criticism is defeated.The ciritics of an ideology criticize it <br />so <br />  that it doesnt get popular.If it becomes popular inspite of it then <br />  criticisms still remain,but it becomes meaningless.</p>
<p>  If people criticize an established ideology <br />  then again we have to see whats the purpose of their criticism.For <br />  example an atheist criticizing religion comes under this <br />category.We <br />  have to see why he still criticizes after knowing that he cannot <br />  destroy something which exists for thousands of years.If he attains <br />  his objective,whatever it might be,then that criticism becomes <br />  meaningful.For example periyar(I detest him,but still)criticized <br />  religion.He achieved some objectives and failed in others.So his <br />  criticisms werent meaningless. </p>
<p>  question:The only remaining factual issue I have with your response <br />  is the statement that "Nazism benefited germans" - you seem to <br />  forget that Germany happened to have as its citizens thousands of <br />  Jews, gypsies and other peoples who happened to be killed in the <br />  Holocaust. But then, I forget you look only at the "collective <br />  benefit" regardless of the costs!</p>
<p>  answer:I should have said "Nazism benefited aryan germans".I <br />believe <br />  that the collective benefit proudced by nazism was negative.If <br />  nazism benefited around 100 million aryan germans it killed around <br />  50 million people in Russia alone.If we calculate 4 mouners per <br />dead <br />  person the costs far outweigh the benefits,so the ideology <br />collapsed.</p>
<p>  For everything there is a cost.If benefits outweigh costs <br />  then anything is useful.If costs outweigh benefits then anything <br />is <br />  useless.What Do I mean by benfits and costs?How to calculate it?<br />  Thats an interesting topic.</p>
<p>  question: As to the second question, you seem to have missed the <br />  point. Most analysts agree with your view that BJP is definitely <br />  successful with the rich and the upper classes/castes - in fact, <br />  that is what a lot of people even have against the BJP. You seem <br />to <br />  forget that no one called any BJP supporters backward. Then again, <br />  lets please not make statements like 'BJP will win 90% of the NRI <br />  vote' when we have no reasonable evidence to prove it. As you very <br />  well know(being a stat student), talking to friends, relatives and <br />  acquaintances across the country is not a reasonable sample space <br />  to assume anything. Note: I am not trying to say that they won't <br />  win, but just that you and I do not have enough info to chumma <br />make <br />  tall statements like that. </p>
<p>    Veena</p>
<p>  reply:I am not just chumma making that statement.I read that in <br />many <br />  magazines.Congress even made complaints to election comission that <br />  BJP gets large funds from NRI's during election times.I also read <br />  feedback pages of outlook which is antibjp.There every feedback <br />  outlook gets from abroad is pro bjp.</p>
<p>  Also the NRI's constitute of upper classes and bhramins.In <br />  every election the upper castes always support <br />  BJP.Jats,kurmis,thakurs all vote BJP.Bhramin vote will never move <br />  away from BJP.</p>
<p>  recently arundathi roy in her article accepted that she <br />  will be condemned by NRI's and she said she wont bother about it.</p>

<p>      (q=question by veena,A=my answer)</p>
<p>      Q:"when people accept an ideology everything else become <br />      meaningless" - <br />      What exactly is "everything else"? Gross generalization with <br />no <br />      substance. The Nazi party was actually "democratically" <br />elected <br />    and <br />      most of the German population went on peacefully with their <br />  lives <br />      during the Holocaust. Doesn't make "anything else"(whatever <br />  that <br />      means) meaningless.</p>
<p>      A:I meant that sentence to give the following meaning.Once <br />  people <br />      accept an ideology the criticisms against it become <br />  meaningless.The <br />      success or failure of an ideology lies solely with the <br />people.If <br />  it <br />      benefits X number of people and harms Y number of people,the <br />  odds <br />      for the success of the ideology is in the ratio of X:Y.</p>
<p>      Nazism benefited germans(X).It harmed the rest of the world<br />      (y).Here X:Y ratio was too low.So the ideology collapsed.For <br />  every <br />      ideology there is an X:Y ratio.Higher the ratio higher is the <br />      probablity for success.If somebody from the non-hindutva camp <br />      estimates the X:Y ratio for hindutva it will be in the ratio of <br />      86:14.Somebody in the hindutva camp will estimate it to be <br />      100:0.Whichever ratio you use,the ratio is high.</p>
<p>      So the criticisms against hindutva are meaningless.</p>
<p>      Q:</p>
<p>      "To call a party that represents half the indian population and <br />      10% of worlds population as fundamentalists and backward <br />  is...it <br />      boils down to your word against 50% of the population." - </p>
<p>      - Forgets the % of the population who did not vote for the <br />  party. <br />      - Forgets the whole group of people who did not vote at all. <br />      - Assumes that whatever % who voted for the party voted <br />because <br />  of <br />      reasons quoted by author. <br />      - Does not take into consideration any regional alliances which <br />  are <br />        such huge players in India nowadays. <br />      - Assumes that someone called 50% of India backward. </p>
<p>      A:It includes everything.If nonvoters vote too,it will be in <br />the <br />      ratio of voters only.For example if an election is conducted <br />  with <br />      following results.</p>
<p>      population=100,votes polled =70,BJP=36,congress=34.</p>
<p>      If the remaining votes are also polled then they too will be in <br />  the <br />      ratio of 36:34 only according to statistics(normal distirbution <br />    laws <br />      and sampling laws state that.If you want I will give you the <br />      statsitical theorums to prove this)There is no reason to <br />believe <br />      that the remaining 30% will be different from the 70% who voted.</p>
<p>      (p.s_I am stat student)</p>
<p>      Voters voted why doesnt matter.BJP has clearly stated its <br />agenda <br />    and <br />      said it will implement it if it wins.If a person who doesnt <br />like <br />      BJP's agenda but hates congress more than BJP votes to bjp <br />  because <br />      of the TINA factor(there is no alternative)he cannot then <br />  complain <br />      if BJP implements its agenda.</p>
<p>      Also BJP doesnt get vote in backward states.It gets votes in <br />      GOA,karnataka,delhi,mumbai,gujarat,maharashtra,punjab-hardly <br />      backward states.To the contrary rich and upper class support <br />    BJP.I'm <br />      in tennessee but have travelled to most parts of USA. I bet <br />that <br />  if <br />      an election is conducted among the NRI's in USA , BJP will win <br />  with <br />      90% of votes.There is overwhelming support to BJP among NRI's <br />in <br />      USA. They are not backward.</p>
<p>      Q: If as the author implies, most or all of the Islamic world <br />      supports fundamentalism, by her own arugument, "as people have <br />      accepted the ideology, everything else is meaningless". Its <br />her <br />      word against the entire Islamic/Christian world!</p>
<p>      Which Islam do you talk about?Spiritual islam has a <br />  very <br />      high X:Y ratio.If Islam is followed like how Abdul Kalam <br />follows <br />      it,like how mullah nasruddin followed it,it has a 100:0 rate of <br />      benefit:harm.</p>
<p>      If you talk about jihadi Islam,the likes followed by <br />      ushama and co the X:Y ratio of that ideology is gonna be 1:100 <br />      million,it will be doomed by the harm it does.Ushama and <br />company <br />    now <br />      fight Europe,America,china,india,Russia,-more than 80% of world <br />      population.Will he ever win this war?No way.</p></priya_vaishnava@y...></p></blockquote>

        <p>I wrote the below mail thinking that it will be my last mail on the <br />subject but even after writing it one hour back, I could not send it <br />as I was held up in a meeting. Before that Sri has said the <br />same.Anyway, I think I have answered much of sri's point in the below <br />mail. the mail might be disorganised and I apologies for that. Time <br />constraint, what to do.</p>
<p>Re. the Balaji temple in Birmingham....it was not done at the cost of <br />the local christians and thats what we too call secularism. </p>
<p>Forgot to write about the lIngam concept yesterday. Just to calrify, <br />Sri, your concept about the lingam structure is also logical, but as <br />far as I know, even the cylindrical part is called lingam and the <br />aavudayar which symbolises female, is a part of the lingam is <br />optional. Kasi viswanathar is a small semicircular structure without <br />the aavudayar. So comparing it with male organ doenst make sense to me<br />(atleast)</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Our group is the best example to show the strature of our country. <br />When a hot topic which </p>
<p>deals with the survival of the Indians or rather the Hindu community <br />(why I said </p>
<p>indians,is because without communal peace no one can be happy) only 5-<br />6 members of the </p>
<p>total 500+ group members participate. Priay/Veena bashaila sollanumna <br />1% of the total </p>
<p>sample space (correct madam's. naan konjam padiparivillathavan. <br />ungala mathiri stats, </p>
<p>science ellam enakku theriyathu.thappa erundha mannikanum). This is <br />how our country </p>
<p>citizens are also not concerned when it comes to national issues of <br />such intensity.</p>
<p>Fine leaving our country's fate behind. The whole issue started with <br />Veena trying blame </p>
<p>the Hindu org. where as I defended saying only because of such org. <br />major conversions are </p>
<p>averted. otherwise whole country will be dominated by the so called <br />minorities.(why 'so </p>
<p>called' - because, generally anywhere in the world, the majority <br />population dominates the </p>
<p>minorities. But only in India, the minority population dominates the <br />majority. Priya I </p>
<p>think your ration is wrong its not 86:14 but 82:18.correct me if I am <br />wrong. For releasing </p>
<p>this statistics the Head of the census comittee was transfered, I <br />suppose)</p>
<p>Sampath, Priya,myself and others qoted many valid points, which Sri <br />and veena are not </p>
<p>ready to accept and they deviate from our points and repeatedly quote <br />stray </p>
<p>incidents.(edhu than reading between the lines nu solluvangala. Eppa <br />than atha practicala </p>
<p>pakkaren...).Probably they are in stray incident finding mission.</p>
<p>I gave the list of destructions caused by Hindu org. and the muslim <br />terrorist, but no </p>
<p>reply.</p>
<p>Sampath explained about the discriminations, again no reply for that. <br />Repeatedly points </p>
<p>are getting deviated with stray incidents.</p>
<p>If I say, all the news published in the media is not true and support <br />it with evidence, I </p>
<p>am blamed of not accepting the facts. If we say, vedas are not wrong, <br />and only people are </p>
<p>wrong, time and again scriptures are criticised. If we say, there was <br />no caste based </p>
<p>society in Hinduism, time and again its being repeated that upper <br />caste discriminate the </p>
<p>lower caste. All stray incidents hold high importance to others. <br />Today I read a news that </p>
<p>a 19 year old Indian girl was stripped and tortured by her boss in <br />Malaysia and alleged </p>
<p>that she stole money. I think I should interpret this news as all <br />Malaysians are torturing </p>
<p>Indians in Malaysia and Malaysian men alwasy strip Indian girls and <br />torture them.</p>
<p>Sampath, Priya and all other Hindutva supporters, I think we are <br />going wrong somewhere. </p>
<p>Let me try to put an anology for this.</p>
<p>Theres a family (like our age old joint family) an ideal family <br />living peacefull, </p>
<p>happily,traditionally, culturally etc.etc. There are father, mother, <br />children, mama, </p>
<p>mami,chittappa, periyappa, anna, thambi, akka, thangai etc...Such a <br />big joint family </p>
<p>surely<br />will have internal misunderstandings and small issues. But still they <br />are living happily. </p>
<p>Here comes a neighbour who feels jealous about this family and wants <br />to loot them of thier </p>
<p>riches. He closely observes them. Husband and wife has some <br />misunderstanding, appa-magan </p>
<p>is having some rupture. annan-thambi is having a small fight. <br />likewise there are several </p>
<p>small issues which any family has. veetukku veedu vasappadi. But <br />still the try to settle </p>
<p>down and live happily. They know its part and parcel of life.</p>
<p>This neighbour, enters this family and poses to be their well wisher. <br />Slowly he corrupts </p>
<p>the minds of each individual, seperately by saying something bad <br />about the others(like our </p>
<p>TV serials). To the father he says, you are retired your sons are not <br />respecting you </p>
<p>anymore. To the wife he says your husband is dominating you and <br />treating you as a slave. </p>
<p>etc.Slowly everone gets corrupted by mind(afterall arpa manida <br />pathargal illiya) and </p>
<p>starts quarrelling amidst them.</p>
<p>During this quarrel, the neighbours(not just one, many) wants to loot <br />them and take away </p>
<p>the wealth(including the people, their girls etc). One person kidnaps <br />the inmates. Other </p>
<p>try to keep on telling wrong about the family members to others and <br />is creating a split in </p>
<p>the family. Other person wants to capture the property itself and <br />demolishes the rooms of </p>
<p>the inmates because its not of his taste and throws them away. <br />Someone tells the wives </p>
<p>that they are treated as slaves and forces them to get divorce. <br />Theifs start entering </p>
<p>their private areas and are looting them like anything. Even the <br />family members are killed </p>
<p>in large numbers by a set of neighbours.</p>
<p>In this state, Priya, Sampath et all, what we say is, we should fight <br />(physically or </p>
<p>legally is not the question here. If we take the legal path, by the <br />time the case finishes </p>
<p>the family would have also been finished). We say at least we need a <br />security gaurd like </p>
<p>the RSS, VHP etc.who can, to some extent protect us.</p>
<p>But we are wrong. Sri, Veena et al, says that we should first sort <br />out our problems within </p>
<p>the family. Each family member should be treated equally and should <br />be assured that they </p>
<p>will be treated equally(which at first place is not at all valid <br />because, there was no<br />discrimination in the first place). We should not talk about the <br />murders done by the </p>
<p>neighbours, but we should solve the internal issues first. We should <br />not bother about the </p>
<p>kidnapping of our children, but should solve the family feuds first. <br />We should not even </p>
<p>have security gaurds to protect our family and we should solve our <br />internal problem first. </p>
<p>People with <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym 47 will come to kill the family members, but the <br />security gaurds should not </acronym></p>
<p>even stop them by holding their hand or slapping them on the face. If <br />RSS,VHP slap them </p>
<p>then they are terrorists. So they should not stop them. They will <br />destruct our house at </p>
<p>thier will but we should not questiong them or react to their <br />actions. Because first we </p>
<p>need to sort our family issues. Thats more important right.After all <br />we need not have any </p>
<p>security gaurds to protect our lives and property, when we have lots <br />of family issues.</p>
<p>When we have so much problems in the family, we dont have the right <br />to condemn others who </p>
<p>come to create more problem in the family. If we do we are <br />terrorists, extremists. We </p>
<p>should not protect ourselves, because the family members are more in <br />number than the </p>
<p>looting neighbours. They are minority and we should support them. We <br />should join hands </p>
<p>with them and kill our own family members. We should join with them <br />and destruct our own </p>
<p>house,because if we oppose, we are (Hindutva) extremists. We should <br />first iron out the </p>
<p>misunderstanding, quarrels amongst us before we try to blame them. <br />Once we sort out our </p>
<p>internal issue,which will never happen bacuase of human nature, then <br />we can start solving </p>
<p>the problems with the external members(if any family member is left <br />out.but thats not of </p>
<p>concern now. Becuase sorting our internal issue is much important)</p>
<p>So again priya, Sampath and other friends, we are on the wrong side . <br />We should change our </p>
<p>attitudes. We should not support Hindutva. We should not blame the <br />muslims are christians. </p>
<p>Hinduism has lots of holes init and if possible lets get converted to <br />Christianity or </p>
<p>Islam. After all we have lot of issues within us, right. So lets <br />blame ourselves for state </p>
<p>we are in. What will they do in the mean time. Muslims will kill all <br />the emaining Hindus </p>
<p>and Christians will convert all the left out Hindus. We are not going <br />to loose </p>
<p>anything,becuase we have internal problems which is of great concern. <br />We will join hands </p>
<p>together to sort this first before questioning the Govt. or the <br />muslims or the christians. </p>
<p>We should not support RSS, VHP and like org. because they are fit to <br />only blame others and </p>
<p>will only slap them if they come to kill us. Slapping is wrong <br />because Jesus said, if </p>
<p>someone slaps you, show your other cheek. Let us try to find more <br />faults in Hinduism and </p>
<p>try to fix those issues first. </p>
<p>Thanks to Sri , Veena and the like minded who enlightened me and <br />cleared my </p>
<p>misconceptions. A great learning indeed. I feel much enlightened and <br />knowledgable now. My </p>
<p>learnings about Hinduism has been proved wrong and I regret wasting <br />my time to learn them. </p>
<p>We have internal issues in Hinduism which are of primary importance. </p>
<p>During Partition, Ambedkar, who is an ICON for the SC/ST's even <br />today, said, all the </p>
<p>muslims should quit India since they have thier own land Pakistan <br />now.Later he himself </p>
<p>converted to Buddism, thats another part of the story. But when he <br />was questioned why he </p>
<p>is supporting that India should be a Hindu country, when he is <br />treated an outcast, he </p>
<p>said, thats Hinduisms internal problem and we will sort it out <br />ourselves. But the main </p>
<p>concern for the country is Muslims should quit so that both Hindus <br />and Muslims can live </p>
<p>peacefully. I think he is a fool to have said that. First he should <br />have tried to sort out </p>
<p>the issues in Hinduism and then should have asked Muslims to quit <br />Inida.</p>
<p>Benny Hinn will call Hindus as Prostitues and all congress leaders <br />will clap for that. We </p>
<p>should not oppose because we have internal problems. We should accept <br />that we are </p>
<p>prostitutes and support the christians because they are minorities.He <br />will spend 40 laksh </p>
<p>and arranges for a meeting to 300000 people and police will find out <br />that prior to the </p>
<p>meeting, lots of college and School students are trained to act on <br />stage as if getting </p>
<p>cured by Benny hinn and will convert, but we should not question it <br />because we have </p>
<p>internal problems. Pope John Paul, who is a religious leader </p>
<p>Muslims will target even the IT companies in Bangalore, but we should <br />not condemn them </p>
<p>because we have internal problems. If possible we should help them by <br />providing bombs to </p>
<p>them. Graham stains wife, who is no one to India, will be nominated <br />for Padma Bhushan </p>
<p>award, but we should not oppose it becuase minorities should feel <br />happy in India. </p>
<p>Thanks once again.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

        <p>Dear All<br />This probably will be the last mail I am writing on this subject I have better things to do that reason with people who are proud that the age old castisms coming back with a vengence and are really proud of it</p>
<p>Also the NRI's constitute of upper classes and bhramins.In <br />every election the upper castes always support <br />BJP.Jats,kurmis,thakurs all vote BJP.Bhramin vote will never move <br />away from BJP.</p>
<p>Dear Priya in that one statement you have really shown that you do accept the varna dharma as it is practiced today and not as krishnaparamathma wanted it to be.....</p>
<p>Aryan Germans? I thought you thought there were no aryans?</p>
<p>People should learn lessons from the past...The holocuast happened because everybody was not bothered when the jews and gypsies were pesecuted....they were minorities so fellow germans didnt care europe didnt care...Churchill didnt till hitler started to bomb london America didnt care because it did not reach its shores...till pearl harbour....till winter hit europe and hitler made the same mistake as napolean...marching thru the alpine conditions towards moscow...</p>
<p>Had hitler been content with what he had the world would have been speaking german.....not that I admire the guy...If you read Leon Uris you ll bleed from your heart if you had one....read MILA18 or EXODUS</p>
<p>I had been to the Dachau concentration camp and thats not as bad as treblinka or aushwitz but it still made you sick when you saw the gas chambers....the pictures and the camps how could one human being do it to another human being?????the same applies to kashmir pundits and muslims the same applies to the gujarat victims the bombay victims and phoolan devi and the thakkurs....</p>
<p>Interestingly there was a Indian tricolour among the dedicated...because four british agents were gased there and one of them was Noor Inayat Khan....a proud indian who fought the germans and laid her life...</p>
<p>The Nazism became unpopular beacuse of hitlers ethnic cleansing.....like the minority cleansing you guys talk about...</p>
<p>I dont see much difference between the pakistani fanatics who wanted Tajmahal broken and taken to Pakistan and the present day fanatics who want to break structures...</p>
<p>I have been to Kashi and Mathura and it does hurt to see a kaabha in the middle of a shrine but rasing them down is not the answer....</p>
<p>No body has answered to my question.. about taking down the maratha and telugu additions to rajarajeswaram....If I was a true tamilian or may be even the tamil kaapu kazhgam wanted to do it whats stopping them....</p>
<p>As a true hindu I dont want the picture of a non believer above my sivan so lets bring the gopuram down.....</p>
<p>Is this the way forward???? Birmingham is the most godless society in birmingham.....but do you know what are the largest sites of religious activity...</p>
<p>The Big Mosque and the Balaji Temple....The balaji temple in birmingham i am told was the first one to be built on Govt funded land the locals objected to it the govt stood fast and said it had to look after its asian brits and hindu brits....</p>
<p>Thats secular as it were</p>
<p>We ll live in a land which will just be a graveyard....<br />Definitely there will be someone turning in his graveyard...</p>
<p>Bharathi....sighing and for these i sang</p>

<p>Q: Well, now that I read your mail again, more inconsistencies seem <br />to crop up. </p>
<p>1. Something about how an ideology will be embraced by the people <br />if it benefits them. How do you define benefit and how does a <br />society measure collective benefit/harm? I am sure you are talking <br />about 'perceived benefit' here. For example, the Bush tax cuts </p>
<blockquote><p>  affected the poor in this country - it cut their welfare schemes <br />by a large % this cutting long-term economic benefits. But still a </p></blockquote>
<p>large % of the people who will be affected by this still voted for <br />him. Its a well known fact(you can look up any kind of election <br />literature) that a good % of people in any election vote against <br />their economic interests. If you are right about people always <br />voting for things that benefit them, an idea called 'propaganda' <br />will not exist in this world today. Perception is not reality!</p>
<p>A:There is nothing in the world which is 100% good and 100% bad.So <br />when somebody makes a choice he will choose something which <br />maximizes his self interest.Self interest and economic benefits are <br />totally different things.Every person has his own standards to <br />measure his self interest.If X can make Y to believe that Y can <br />maximize his self interest by doing what X says then X is the king.</p>
<p>As an example kerry said that american well being lies in a better <br />economy.Bush convinced people that rather than going for money <br />following jesus will maximize theior self interest.He offered <br />himself as the alternative to attain that self interest <br />maximization.People chose him as a result.Kerry lost since he <br />thought people will prefer economics over god.</p>
<p>People who voted for Bush thought that religion will maximize their <br />self interest than money.Money is a way to maximize self <br />interest,not an end by itself.Propogands plays a crucial role here.</p>
<p>Q: You talk something abt a success ratio for Hindutva. The idea, </p>
<blockquote><p>  might very well succeed but history has taught us time and time <br />again that no ideology(however good or bad it may be) stays at the </p></blockquote>
<p>top or bottom forever. Its a cycle that all must go through.</p>
<p>A:No need to be number 1.An ideologies success is measured by the <br />number of lives it benefits. </p>
<p>q: You talk abt a 'high' ratio for the success of Hindutva. Again, <br />the idea might very well succeed for a time but who gave you these <br />86, 14 type ratios? Where is the basis? Any factual proof or just <br />from thin air? The more I read this, the more I get the feeling <br />that this logic is similar to certain ratios that the 'people's <br />communist republics' talked abt in the last century.</p>
<p>a: Hindutva will benefit hindus.There are 86% hindus in the <br />country.The remaining 14% are minorities who feel that hindutva will <br />harm them.So the benefit cost ratio of hindutva is 86:14.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Priya,<br />Ofcourse, I do not agree(I cannot see how anyone could) that just </p></blockquote>
<p>because an idea is successful(for certain definitions of the word <br />success), the criticisms against it can be called meaningless but <br />then again, thats your view. Cool. </p>
<p>Reply:My definition for success is acceptance by the <br />concerned group.Criticisms going meaningless means that the purpose <br />of criticism is defeated.The ciritics of an ideology criticize it so <br />that it doesnt get popular.If it becomes popular inspite of it then <br />criticisms still remain,but it becomes meaningless.</p>
<p>If people criticize an established ideology <br />then again we have to see whats the purpose of their criticism.For <br />example an atheist criticizing religion comes under this category.We <br />have to see why he still criticizes after knowing that he cannot <br />destroy something which exists for thousands of years.If he attains <br />his objective,whatever it might be,then that criticism becomes <br />meaningful.For example periyar(I detest him,but still)criticized <br />religion.He achieved some objectives and failed in others.So his <br />criticisms werent meaningless. </p>
<p>question:The only remaining factual issue I have with your response <br />is the statement that "Nazism benefited germans" - you seem to <br />forget that Germany happened to have as its citizens thousands of <br />Jews, gypsies and other peoples who happened to be killed in the <br />Holocaust. But then, I forget you look only at the "collective <br />benefit" regardless of the costs!</p>
<p>answer:I should have said "Nazism benefited aryan germans".I believe <br />that the collective benefit proudced by nazism was negative.If <br />nazism benefited around 100 million aryan germans it killed around <br />50 million people in Russia alone.If we calculate 4 mouners per dead <br />person the costs far outweigh the benefits,so the ideology collapsed.</p>
<p>For everything there is a cost.If benefits outweigh costs <br />then anything is useful.If costs outweigh benefits then anything is <br />useless.What Do I mean by benfits and costs?How to calculate it?<br />Thats an interesting topic.</p>
<p>question: As to the second question, you seem to have missed the <br />point. Most analysts agree with your view that BJP is definitely <br />successful with the rich and the upper classes/castes - in fact, <br />that is what a lot of people even have against the BJP. You seem to <br />forget that no one called any BJP supporters backward. Then again, <br />lets please not make statements like 'BJP will win 90% of the NRI <br />vote' when we have no reasonable evidence to prove it. As you very <br />well know(being a stat student), talking to friends, relatives and <br />acquaintances across the country is not a reasonable sample space <br />to assume anything. Note: I am not trying to say that they won't <br />win, but just that you and I do not have enough info to chumma make <br />tall statements like that. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Veena</p></blockquote>
<p>reply:I am not just chumma making that statement.I read that in many <br />magazines.Congress even made complaints to election comission that <br />BJP gets large funds from NRI's during election times.I also read <br />feedback pages of outlook which is antibjp.There every feedback <br />outlook gets from abroad is pro bjp.</p>
<p>Also the NRI's constitute of upper classes and bhramins.In <br />every election the upper castes always support <br />BJP.Jats,kurmis,thakurs all vote BJP.Bhramin vote will never move <br />away from BJP.</p>
<p>recently arundathi roy in her article accepted that she <br />will be condemned by NRI's and she said she wont bother about it.</p>

<p>    (q=question by veena,A=my answer)</p>
<p>    Q:"when people accept an ideology everything else become <br />    meaningless" - <br />    What exactly is "everything else"? Gross generalization with no <br />    substance. The Nazi party was actually "democratically" elected <br />  and <br />    most of the German population went on peacefully with their <br />lives <br />    during the Holocaust. Doesn't make "anything else"(whatever <br />that <br />    means) meaningless.</p>
<p>    A:I meant that sentence to give the following meaning.Once <br />people <br />    accept an ideology the criticisms against it become <br />meaningless.The <br />    success or failure of an ideology lies solely with the people.If <br />it <br />    benefits X number of people and harms Y number of people,the <br />odds <br />    for the success of the ideology is in the ratio of X:Y.</p>
<p>    Nazism benefited germans(X).It harmed the rest of the world<br />    (y).Here X:Y ratio was too low.So the ideology collapsed.For <br />every <br />    ideology there is an X:Y ratio.Higher the ratio higher is the <br />    probablity for success.If somebody from the non-hindutva camp <br />    estimates the X:Y ratio for hindutva it will be in the ratio of <br />    86:14.Somebody in the hindutva camp will estimate it to be <br />    100:0.Whichever ratio you use,the ratio is high.</p>
<p>    So the criticisms against hindutva are meaningless.</p>
<p>    Q:</p>
<p>    "To call a party that represents half the indian population and <br />    10% of worlds population as fundamentalists and backward <br />is...it <br />    boils down to your word against 50% of the population." - </p>
<p>    - Forgets the % of the population who did not vote for the <br />party. <br />    - Forgets the whole group of people who did not vote at all. <br />    - Assumes that whatever % who voted for the party voted because <br />of <br />    reasons quoted by author. <br />    - Does not take into consideration any regional alliances which <br />are <br />      such huge players in India nowadays. <br />    - Assumes that someone called 50% of India backward. </p>
<p>    A:It includes everything.If nonvoters vote too,it will be in the <br />    ratio of voters only.For example if an election is conducted <br />with <br />    following results.</p>
<p>    population=100,votes polled =70,BJP=36,congress=34.</p>
<p>    If the remaining votes are also polled then they too will be in <br />the <br />    ratio of 36:34 only according to statistics(normal distirbution <br />  laws <br />    and sampling laws state that.If you want I will give you the <br />    statsitical theorums to prove this)There is no reason to believe <br />    that the remaining 30% will be different from the 70% who voted.</p>
<p>    (p.s_I am stat student)</p>
<p>    Voters voted why doesnt matter.BJP has clearly stated its agenda <br />  and <br />    said it will implement it if it wins.If a person who doesnt like <br />    BJP's agenda but hates congress more than BJP votes to bjp <br />because <br />    of the TINA factor(there is no alternative)he cannot then <br />complain <br />    if BJP implements its agenda.</p>
<p>    Also BJP doesnt get vote in backward states.It gets votes in <br />    GOA,karnataka,delhi,mumbai,gujarat,maharashtra,punjab-hardly <br />    backward states.To the contrary rich and upper class support <br />  BJP.I'm <br />    in tennessee but have travelled to most parts of USA. I bet that <br />if <br />    an election is conducted among the NRI's in USA , BJP will win <br />with <br />    90% of votes.There is overwhelming support to BJP among NRI's in <br />    USA. They are not backward.</p>

<p>    Which Islam do you talk about?Spiritual islam has a <br />very <br />    high X:Y ratio.If Islam is followed like how Abdul Kalam follows <br />    it,like how mullah nasruddin followed it,it has a 100:0 rate of <br />    benefit:harm.</p>
<p>    If you talk about jihadi Islam,the likes followed by <br />    ushama and co the X:Y ratio of that ideology is gonna be 1:100 <br />    million,it will be doomed by the harm it does.Ushama and company <br />  now <br />    fight Europe,America,china,india,Russia,-more than 80% of world <br />    population.Will he ever win this war?No way.</p></priya_vaishnava@y...></p></blockquote>

        <p>Well, now that I read your mail again, more inconsistencies seem to <br />crop up. </p>
<p>1. Something about how an ideology will be embraced by the people if <br />it benefits them. How do you define benefit and how does a society <br />measure collective benefit/harm? I am sure you are talking <br />about 'perceived benefit' here. For example, the Bush tax cuts <br />affected the poor in this country - it cut their welfare schemes by a <br />large % this cutting long-term economic benefits. But still a large % <br />of the people who will be affected by this still voted for him. Its a <br />well known fact(you can look up any kind of election literature) that <br />a good % of people in any election vote against their economic <br />interests. If you are right about people always voting for things <br />that benefit them, an idea called 'propaganda' will not exist in this <br />world today. Perception is not reality!</p>
<p>2. You talk something abt a success ratio for Hindutva. The idea, <br />might very well succeed but history has taught us time and time again <br />that no ideology(however good or bad it may be) stays at the top or <br />bottom forever. Its a cycle that all must go through. </p>
<p>3. You talk abt a 'high' ratio for the success of Hindutva. Again, <br />the idea might very well succeed for a time but who gave you these <br />86, 14 type ratios? Where is the basis? Any factual proof or just <br />from thin air? The more I read this, the more I get the feeling that <br />this logic is similar to certain ratios that the 'people's communist <br />republics' talked abt in the last century.</p>

<p>  (q=question by veena,A=my answer)</p>
<p>  Q:"when people accept an ideology everything else become <br />  meaningless" - <br />  What exactly is "everything else"? Gross generalization with no <br />  substance. The Nazi party was actually "democratically" elected <br />and <br />  most of the German population went on peacefully with their lives <br />  during the Holocaust. Doesn't make "anything else"(whatever that <br />  means) meaningless.</p>
<p>  A:I meant that sentence to give the following meaning.Once people <br />  accept an ideology the criticisms against it become meaningless.The <br />  success or failure of an ideology lies solely with the people.If it <br />  benefits X number of people and harms Y number of people,the odds <br />  for the success of the ideology is in the ratio of X:Y.</p>
<p>  Nazism benefited germans(X).It harmed the rest of the world<br />  (y).Here X:Y ratio was too low.So the ideology collapsed.For every <br />  ideology there is an X:Y ratio.Higher the ratio higher is the <br />  probablity for success.If somebody from the non-hindutva camp <br />  estimates the X:Y ratio for hindutva it will be in the ratio of <br />  86:14.Somebody in the hindutva camp will estimate it to be <br />  100:0.Whichever ratio you use,the ratio is high.</p>
<p>  So the criticisms against hindutva are meaningless.</p>
<p>  Q:</p>
<p>  "To call a party that represents half the indian population and <br />  10% of worlds population as fundamentalists and backward is...it <br />  boils down to your word against 50% of the population." - </p>
<p>  - Forgets the % of the population who did not vote for the party. <br />  - Forgets the whole group of people who did not vote at all. <br />  - Assumes that whatever % who voted for the party voted because of <br />  reasons quoted by author. <br />  - Does not take into consideration any regional alliances which are <br />    such huge players in India nowadays. <br />  - Assumes that someone called 50% of India backward. </p>
<p>  A:It includes everything.If nonvoters vote too,it will be in the <br />  ratio of voters only.For example if an election is conducted with <br />  following results.</p>
<p>  population=100,votes polled =70,BJP=36,congress=34.</p>
<p>  If the remaining votes are also polled then they too will be in the <br />  ratio of 36:34 only according to statistics(normal distirbution <br />laws <br />  and sampling laws state that.If you want I will give you the <br />  statsitical theorums to prove this)There is no reason to believe <br />  that the remaining 30% will be different from the 70% who voted.</p>
<p>  (p.s_I am stat student)</p>
<p>  Voters voted why doesnt matter.BJP has clearly stated its agenda <br />and <br />  said it will implement it if it wins.If a person who doesnt like <br />  BJP's agenda but hates congress more than BJP votes to bjp because <br />  of the TINA factor(there is no alternative)he cannot then complain <br />  if BJP implements its agenda.</p>
<p>  Also BJP doesnt get vote in backward states.It gets votes in <br />  GOA,karnataka,delhi,mumbai,gujarat,maharashtra,punjab-hardly <br />  backward states.To the contrary rich and upper class support <br />BJP.I'm <br />  in tennessee but have travelled to most parts of USA. I bet that if <br />  an election is conducted among the NRI's in USA , BJP will win with <br />  90% of votes.There is overwhelming support to BJP among NRI's in <br />  USA. They are not backward.</p>
<p>  Q: If as the author implies, most or all of the Islamic world <br />  supports fundamentalism, by her own arugument, "as people have <br />  accepted the ideology, everything else is meaningless". Its her <br />  word against the entire Islamic/Christian world!</p>

        <p>Priya,</p>
<p>As to the first question, I apologize. Slight misunderstanding on my <br />part. I thought you were talking about right and wrong and their <br />relationship to success and failure. I realise now you were just <br />talking abt success and failure regardless of how many people are <br />killed or affected. I have no issues with your argument then.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, I do not agree(I cannot see how anyone could) that just <br />because an idea is successful(for certain definitions of the word <br />success), the criticisms against it can be called meaningless but <br />then again, thats your view. Cool. </p>
<p>The only remaining factual issue I have with your response is the <br />statement that "Nazism benefited germans" - you seem to forget that <br />Germany happened to have as its citizens thousands of Jews, gypsies <br />and other peoples who happened to be killed in the Holocaust. But <br />then, I forget you look only at the "collective benefit" regardless <br />of the costs!</p>
<p>As to the second question, you seem to have missed the point. Most <br />analysts agree with your view that BJP is definitely successful with <br />the rich and the upper classes/castes - in fact, that is what a lot <br />of people even have against the BJP. You seem to forget that no one <br />called any BJP supporters backward. Then again, lets please not make <br />statements like 'BJP will win 90% of the NRI vote' when we have no <br />reasonable evidence to prove it. As you very well know(being a stat <br />student), talking to friends, relatives and acquaintances across the <br />country is not a reasonable sample space to assume anything. Note: I <br />am not trying to say that they won't win, but just that you and I do <br />not have enough info to chumma make tall statements like that. </p>

<p>Nazism benefited germans(X).It harmed the rest of the world<br />(y).Here X:Y ratio was too low.So the ideology collapsed.For every <br />ideology there is an X:Y ratio.Higher the ratio higher is the <br />probablity for success.If somebody from the non-hindutva camp <br />estimates the X:Y ratio for hindutva it will be in the ratio of <br />86:14.Somebody in the hindutva camp will estimate it to be <br />100:0.Whichever ratio you use,the ratio is high.</p>
<p>So the criticisms against hindutva are meaningless.</p>
<p>Q:</p>
<p>"To call a party that represents half the indian population and <br />10% of worlds population as fundamentalists and backward is...it <br />boils down to your word against 50% of the population." - </p>
<p>- Forgets the % of the population who did not vote for the party. <br />- Forgets the whole group of people who did not vote at all. <br />- Assumes that whatever % who voted for the party voted because of <br />reasons quoted by author. <br />- Does not take into consideration any regional alliances which are </p>
<blockquote><p>  such huge players in India nowadays. <br />- Assumes that someone called 50% of India backward. </p></blockquote>
<p>A:It includes everything.If nonvoters vote too,it will be in the <br />ratio of voters only.For example if an election is conducted with <br />following results.</p>
<p>population=100,votes polled =70,BJP=36,congress=34.</p>
<p>If the remaining votes are also polled then they too will be in the <br />ratio of 36:34 only according to statistics(normal distirbution laws <br />and sampling laws state that.If you want I will give you the <br />statsitical theorums to prove this)There is no reason to believe <br />that the remaining 30% will be different from the 70% who voted.</p>
<p>(p.s_I am stat student)</p>
<p>Voters voted why doesnt matter.BJP has clearly stated its agenda and <br />said it will implement it if it wins.If a person who doesnt like <br />BJP's agenda but hates congress more than BJP votes to bjp because <br />of the TINA factor(there is no alternative)he cannot then complain <br />if BJP implements its agenda.</p>
<p>Also BJP doesnt get vote in backward states.It gets votes in <br />GOA,karnataka,delhi,mumbai,gujarat,maharashtra,punjab-hardly <br />backward states.To the contrary rich and upper class support BJP.I'm <br />in tennessee but have travelled to most parts of USA. I bet that if <br />an election is conducted among the NRI's in USA , BJP will win with <br />90% of votes.There is overwhelming support to BJP among NRI's in <br />USA. They are not backward.</p>
<p>Q: If as the author implies, most or all of the Islamic world <br />supports fundamentalism, by her own arugument, "as people have <br />accepted the ideology, everything else is meaningless". Its her <br />word against the entire Islamic/Christian world!</p>
<p>Which Islam do you talk about?Spiritual islam has a very <br />high X:Y ratio.If Islam is followed like how Abdul Kalam follows <br />it,like how mullah nasruddin followed it,it has a 100:0 rate of <br />benefit:harm.</p>
<p>If you talk about jihadi Islam,the likes followed by <br />ushama and co the X:Y ratio of that ideology is gonna be 1:100 <br />million,it will be doomed by the harm it does.Ushama and company now <br />fight Europe,America,china,india,Russia,-more than 80% of world <br />population.Will he ever win this war?No way.</p>

<p>Really? Have you ever watched Jon Stewart's 'The Daily Show'? Do you <br />remember watching Jay Leno during the Boston church allegations? Have <br />you read Christopher Hitchens on 'The Slate' anytime? What about NY <br />Times editorials? Unless you live South of the Mason-Dixon line and <br />watch only Fox news and listen to Rush Limbaugh, I do not see how you <br />could have missed all the media criticism hurled at priests at the <br />height of the scandal.</p>
<p>I am with you when you imply that the mainstream US media is more or <br />less a sellout but lets please give them credit when its due. </p>

        <p>For reasons already stated, I am def not going into deep arguments <br />about religions and violence on this bboard. Instead, I just plan to <br />question some 'facts' and 'analogies' that are being quoted <br />throughout the list. What one deduces from facts is up to one's <br />logical faculties and I don't propose to go into that at all.</p>
<p>"when people accept an ideology everything else become meaningless" - <br />What exactly is "everything else"? Gross generalization with no <br />substance. The Nazi party was actually "democratically" elected and <br />most of the German population went on peacefully with their lives <br />during the Holocaust. Doesn't make "anything else"(whatever that <br />means) meaningless.</p>
<p>"To call a party that represents half the indian population and <br />10% of worlds population as fundamentalists and backward is...it <br />boils down to your word against 50% of the population." - <br />- Forgets the % of the population who did not vote for the party. <br />- Forgets the whole group of people who did not vote at all. <br />- Assumes that whatever % who voted for the party voted because of <br />reasons quoted by author. <br />- Does not take into consideration any regional alliances which are <br />such huge players in India nowadays. <br />- Assumes that someone called 50% of India backward. <br />- If as the author implies, most or all of the Islamic world supports <br />fundamentalism, by her own arugument, "as people have accepted the <br />ideology, everything else is meaningless". Its her word against the <br />entire Islamic/Christian world!</p>

<p>    Regardless, if getting votes makes things right, the Indian <br />masses <br />    must really like pseudo-secularism! Otherwise why would Congress <br />  rule <br />    now?

<p>Sundar,in our country the victims will never get <br />justice.I want to point out two incidents.One is the Godhra incident <br />and another one is the best bakery case.In godhra the victims were <br />hindus and in best bakery case the victims were muslims.</p>
<p>Banerjee comission has said that the godhra burning <br />was an accident(???!!!).It seems that the passengers did not jump <br />out of the s6 coach when it caught fire (from inside the coach),due <br />to some strange reasons.They locked it inside for some reason,fire <br />occured and all died.</p>
<p>Similiarly best bakery case will end up with the <br />accused being released since zakira sheikh,whose family was <br />burnt,now detracts and says she doesnt know how the bakery was on <br />fire.</p>
<p>The killing of 3000 sikhs in 1984 still remains a <br />puzzle.After 20 years the comission has given its report indicating-<br />none.</p>
<p>"Survival of the fittest"-works in jungle and in <br />India.</p>

        <p>By whatever name you call it,BJP is a national force with literally <br />around 50% of population on its side and the remaining 50% with the <br />other side.Our country now is divided on 2 ideologies Left and right.</p>
<p>This is not unique to India.Even in USA the country is divided on <br />two poles-right and left.Right wing rules USA now.In next election <br />left wing republicans will come to power.</p>
<p>Democrats accused republicans of being nazis,backward,anti-<br />science,dogmatic,fascist,anti-muslim,anti-human,murderers,war <br />mongers..everything BJP is being accused of.</p>
<p>Still republicans won the election.</p>
<p>when people accept an ideology everything else become <br />meaningless.50% support BJP,50% oppose it.This 50% support came in <br />the past 10 years.Its only growing.It can be stopped if their <br />genuine demands are fulfilled.If not the support base will only <br />grow.To call a party that represents half the indian population and <br />10% of worlds population as fundamentalists and backward is...it <br />boils down to your word against 50% of the population.</p>
<p>The majority hindu is feeling unsecure in his own country.This <br />resulted in the growth of BJP.If this isnt addressed BJP will <br />continue to grow.</p>

        <p>Facts, Priya, facts. When one quotes statistics, one needs to be as <br />accurate as possible. BJP wasn't the main opposition party in the <br />remaining states - off the top of my head, it def was not the main <br />opposition party in Kerala where it has not won a single MP seat till <br />date.</p>
<p>Regardless, if getting votes makes things right, the Indian masses <br />must really like pseudo-secularism! Otherwise why would Congress rule <br />now? (Disclaimer: I am not commenting on whether one party is better <br />than the other, just questioning the logic applied)</p>

<p>  BJP secured 100 million votes in last parlimentary elections.It had <br />  parlimentary members from Kanyakumari to jammu and from mumbai to <br />  tiripura.It ruled India and 15 Indian states and was main <br />opposition <br />  party in the remaining states.It gained support only because the <br />  people endorsed its ideologies.</p>
