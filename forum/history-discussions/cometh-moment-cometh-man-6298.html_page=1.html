        <p>Malathi,<br />We are talking about talent not about the philanthropic activities of people<br />in the Cine field. I do have the highest regards for people who do all this<br />... That too with out a hint of publicity that they are doing that. But<br />thats not in the main stream discussion of this thread.</p>
<p>Also earning money thats also not counted as there are other music directors<br />who have made loads of money which IR can never ever think of.</p>
<p>So lets lets discuss music alone</p>
<p>1. Talent / Exposure to music / Chances of learning music when they were<br />young / Surroundings ...<br />2. Knowledge of music (Carnatic / Hindustani / Western Classic)<br />3. Application of what they learned<br />4. Innovation / Experiments in their field</p>
<p>Having said that I am a great fan of Mr.MSV / Mr.KVM. I have not analyzed<br />Mr.KVM very critically to some extent Mr.MSV. Again I will tell you the<br />difference in cricketing terms (In which I am at home) In olden days Leg<br />Glance or Flick is played when the ball is pitching on leg stump and leaving<br />the leg stump. Playing that shot is not everybody's forte. Few played it<br />well.</p>
<p>But it was GR Vishwanath who re-defined the flick / leg glance. Even if the<br />ball pitches on off stump and moves towards middle stump he would flick the<br />ball and it will run to boundary. He would do this effortlessly .<br />Improvisation at its best. Defying the grammar of music I have given<br />examples in my earlier posy\t.</p>
<p>Similarly late cut between Wicket Keeper and 1st slip / 1st slip and 2nd<br />slip / Slip and Gully. All these need little variation in his hand grip,<br />open the face of the bat and timing. Similarly moving from one Raga to<br />another Rage and then coming back to the rage where he started -- IR is a<br />master in that.</p>
<p>Vishy use to play shots in a area where there is no fielder. The bowling<br />captain would move a fielder to the position where Vishy scored runs.<br />Immediately Vishy would play a shot into the place from where the fielder<br />was moved. IR would compose on Ragas which others would not even think of.</p>
<p>Laters!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Udanx, I have no problems with anyone calling IR a legend or for that<br />  matter appreciating how much effort it took for him to reach where he was.</p>
<p>  Also to remember - olden days musicians did not make a fraction of money<br />  that IR did.Many of them did not even have their name mentioned in the<br />  credits occasionally. KVM helped many younger musicians without his name<br />  mentioned - including MSV and Ghantasala. Ghantasala in turn helped several<br />  people like TV Raju and even SP Balasubramaiam with no credit at all and he<br />  sang many of his own songs since he could not afford playback singers, he<br />  was a very good singer but in spite of that. In fact it was SPB who erected<br />  a statue for his guru/master as he called him very recently. Ghantasala<br />  died of throat cancer and insisting on singing even until the very last day.<br />  Mohammed Rafi up north was very similar. Rafi used to send anonymous money<br />  contributions in fact to struggling young playback artistes.<br />  There is no one person or one anyone who is above and beyond others. Kalai<br />  ulagam is a contribution of multiple people.</p>

<p>  Arun,</p>
<p>  I have high regards / respects to all the music doyens. But in my<br />  opinion one cannot put the work of IR in simple words, as mentioned in your<br />  mail. He took the "BEST" from every form of music - Carnatic / Hindustani /<br />  Western Classical. He used this knowledge and fused them together when he<br />  composed songs.</p>
<p>  For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal training in<br />  music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in his pocket,<br />  analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying them to film<br />  music ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than done. If I<br />  start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this forum. For me<br />  other musicians great people /doyens and this man is a LEGEND.</p>

<p>   A veritable fount of information! :) Thanks for all that.<br />   I always wondered why KVM didn't do more movies in Tamizh..<br />   Shankarabharanam was KVM right?<br />   Great songs!</p>
<p>   The thing about IR was that he made songs based on classical ragas but<br />   made them in such a way that it was easily hummable by the masses.. amazing.</p>

<p>    Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was Madurai<br />    Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was Ghantasala<br />    at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let the<br />    movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing.<br />    Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in<br />    Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great<br />    but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or<br />    cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he has used<br />    many ragas and many singers.</p>
<p>    Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies<br />    bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another<br />    one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie<br />    mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African<br />    samba music is another treat.</p>
<p>    KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's<br />    guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai<br />    AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute<br />    work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to<br />    telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone (until<br />    IR came on the seen again).</p>

<p>      Thanks Malathy for that history lesson :) I have Sampoorna<br />    Ramayanam..<br />      didn't know it was by Ramanathan.. I love the "Jagam pugazhum<br />    puNNiya<br />      kathai" song from LavaKusa.. is that by Ghantasala?<br />      I think Ghantasala has a more profound impact on Telugu film music<br />    than on<br />      Tamizh.</p>

<p>        Arun, I learnt classical music from movies too!! I had a strong<br />        aversion of the way classical music was taught - rigid ways with<br />        little creative force and hero worship of musicians,strong caste<br />        factors - so I learnt from movies and after grade 9 attended<br />    classes<br />        and learnt formally. Some generic fyi on old tamil classical<br />    songs in<br />        case you are interested.. .</p>
<p>        G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman( SV Sekar's dad who gave music for<br />    MSS's<br />        Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin<br />        Mummoorthigal in those days.</p>
<p>        Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - Devadas is an<br />        evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's<br />    unbearable<br />        Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the most<br />        famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU<br />    Chinnappa's<br />        clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />        (Shankarabharanam) . I can't recall more on CR right away. G<br />        Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's guru.<br />        Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna<br />        Ramayanam... Wow what a list and most of them classical treats. Who<br />        can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama<br />    puthiran<br />        or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used Mukari<br />    that<br />        way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the MLV<br />    song to<br />        Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai Veeran.</p>
<p>        There are amazing directors in other languages as far as classical<br />        music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala in<br />        Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil<br />        too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.</p>
<p>        IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to<br />    give<br />        him credit for that, and his creativity/innovati on is perhaps</p>
<p>        unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which<br />    unfortunately<br />        is very forgotten.</p>

<p>              Aah Raja the Great... it is truly wonderful to listen to his<br />            creations and<br />              one can appreciate it at so many different levels.. carnatic<br />            classical or<br />              western.. here is something I had written on a Guitar forum<br />    on<br />        Madai<br />              Thiranthu.. this might not be everyone's cup of tea but<br />    just to<br />            give you a<br />              flavor for how we can all appreciate Raja in our own way:</p>
<p>              Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and<br />    discusses<br />        the<br />            tamil<br />              song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/ progression<br />        etc. I<br />            doubt it<br />              will be of too much interest to people other than those who<br />        follow<br />            tamil<br />              songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>              I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to<br />    the<br />            song "Madai<br />              Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>              I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is<br />    the<br />            original one<br />              since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but<br />    it<br />            still works.<br />              If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />        around.</p>
<p>              Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>              A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>              The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>              A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>              (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have<br />    found<br />        that<br />            it<br />              usually helps to understand the scale first before going on<br />    to<br />        the<br />            chords).</p>
<p>              The other thing to note is that you could call this the<br />    A#maj<br />        Scale<br />            or the<br />              Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj<br />    scale.<br />        (On<br />            the<br />              fretboard, you can identify this by going down three<br />    semitones<br />            (half notes)<br />              to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and<br />        chords<br />            remain<br />              the same except that you would start from G instead of A#.<br />    On<br />        second<br />              thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />        this<br />            the Gmin<br />              Scale.</p>
<p>              Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief<br />    discussion:</p>
<p>              Dm Gm A# Dm<br />              Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>              Dm Gm A# Dm<br />              Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>
<p>              Dm Cm Gm<br />              Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram</p>
<p>              Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />              Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu</p>
<p>              Intro - 1<br />              ---------</p>
<p>              Stanza - 1<br />              ==========</p>
<p>              Dm A# Gm A#<br />              Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu</p>
<p>              Dm A# Gm A#<br />              Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>              Cm Cm Cm A#<br />              Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>              A# A# A# Cm<br />              Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>              Cm Dm<br />              YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>              The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>              A few things to note:</p>
<p>              In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>              Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>              I IV V</p>
<p>              where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and<br />    dominant of<br />        the<br />            scale.</p>
<p>              1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves<br />    to the<br />            tonic (Gm)<br />              at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this<br />    interesting<br />            because<br />              usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />        follow<br />            some<br />              chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards<br />    the<br />        end.</p>
<p>              2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />        (nice..<br />            different<br />              from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>              3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />        (Ninaiththathu<br />              paLiththathu) .. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />    III-<br />        V-IV-<br />            VII<br />              resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>              4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression<br />    before<br />            getting to<br />              IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that.<br />        Creates<br />            a<br />              certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to<br />    the I,<br />            which is<br />              done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I<br />    have<br />            found that<br />              I usually love songs that do this uniformally. . (also songs<br />        where<br />            there are<br />              scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>              5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the<br />    mix.<br />            Now this is<br />              obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />        Maestro<br />            that :)<br />              It creates a very nice effect.</p>
<p>              Regards,</p>

        <p>Udanx, I have no problems with anyone calling IR a legend or for that matter appreciating how much effort it took for him to reach where he was.<br />?<br />Also to remember - olden days musicians did not make a fraction of money that IR did.Many of them did not even have their name mentioned in the credits occasionally. KVM helped many younger musicians without his name mentioned - including MSV and Ghantasala. Ghantasala in turn helped several people like TV Raju and even SP Balasubramaiam with no credit at all and he sang?many of his own songs since he could not afford playback singers, he wasa very good singer but in spite of that.?In fact it was SPB who erected a statue for his guru/master as he called him very recently.? Ghantasala died of throat cancer and insisting on singing even until the very last day. Mohammed Rafi up north was very similar. Rafi used to send anonymous money contributions in fact to struggling young playback artistes.</p>
<p>There is no one person or one anyone who is above and beyond others. Kalai ulagam is a contribution of multiple people. <br />?<br />Malathi<br />--- On Thu, 9/11/08, Udanx <udanks@gmail.com  wrote:</p>

<p>Arun,<br />?<br />I have high regards / respects to all the music doyens. ?But in my opinion?one cannot put the work of IR?in simple words, as mentioned in your mail. He took the?"BEST" from every form of music - Carnatic / Hindustani / Western Classical.?He used this knowledge and fused them together?when he composed songs.<br />?<br />For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal training in music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in his pocket, analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying them to filmmusic ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than done. IfI start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this forum. For me other musicians great people /doyens and this man is a LEGEND.<br />?<br />~ Udanx</p>

<p>A veritable fount of information! :) Thanks for all that.<br />I always wondered why KVM didn't do more movies in Tamizh.. Shankarabharanam was KVM right?<br />Great songs!</p>

<p>Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was Madurai <br />Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was Ghantasala <br />at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let the <br />movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing. <br />Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in <br />Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great <br />but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or <br />cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he has used <br />many ragas and many singers.</p>
<p>Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies <br />bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another <br />one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie <br />mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African <br />samba music is another treat. </p>
<p>KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's <br />guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai <br />AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute <br />work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to <br />telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone (until <br />IR came on the seen again).</p>

<p>    Arun, I learnt classical music from movies too!! I had a strong<br />    aversion of the way classical music was taught - rigid ways with<br />    little creative force and hero worship of musicians,strong caste<br />    factors - so I learnt from movies and after grade 9 attended <br />classes<br />    and learnt formally. Some generic fyi on old tamil classical <br />songs in<br />    case you are interested.. .</p>
<p>    G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman( SV Sekar's dad who gave music for <br />MSS's<br />    Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin<br />    Mummoorthigal in those days.</p>
<p>    Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - Devadas is an<br />    evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's <br />unbearable<br />    Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the most<br />    famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU <br />Chinnappa's<br />    clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />    (Shankarabharanam) . I can't recall more on CR right away. G<br />    Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's guru.<br />    Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna<br />    Ramayanam... Wow what a list and most of them classical treats. Who<br />    can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama <br />puthiran<br />    or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used Mukari <br />that<br />    way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the MLV <br />song to<br />    Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai Veeran.</p>
<p>    There are amazing directors in other languages as far as classical<br />    music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala in<br />    Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil<br />    too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.</p>
<p>    IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to <br />give<br />    him credit for that, and his creativity/innovati on is perhaps<br />    unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which <br />unfortunately<br />    is very forgotten.</p>

<p>          Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and <br />discusses<br />    the<br />        tamil<br />          song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/ progression<br />    etc. I<br />        doubt it<br />          will be of too much interest to people other than those who<br />    follow<br />        tamil<br />          songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>          I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to <br />the<br />        song "Madai<br />          Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>          I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is <br />the<br />        original one<br />          since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but <br />it<br />        still works.<br />          If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />    around.</p>
<p>          Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>          A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>          The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>          A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>          (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have <br />found<br />    that<br />        it<br />          usually helps to understand the scale first before going on <br />to<br />    the<br />        chords).</p>
<p>          The other thing to note is that you could call this the <br />A#maj<br />    Scale<br />        or the<br />          Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj <br />scale.<br />    (On<br />        the<br />          fretboard, you can identify this by going down three <br />semitones<br />        (half notes)<br />          to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and<br />    chords<br />        remain<br />          the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. <br />On<br />    second<br />          thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />    this<br />        the Gmin<br />          Scale.</p>
<p>          Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief <br />discussion:</p>
<p>          Dm Gm A# Dm<br />          Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>          Dm Gm A# Dm<br />          Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>
<p>          Dm Cm Gm<br />          Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram</p>
<p>          Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />          Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu</p>
<p>          Intro - 1<br />          ---------</p>
<p>          Stanza - 1<br />          ==========</p>
<p>          Dm A# Gm A#<br />          Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu</p>
<p>          Dm A# Gm A#<br />          Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>          Cm Cm Cm A#<br />          Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>          A# A# A# Cm<br />          Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>          Cm Dm<br />          YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>          The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>          A few things to note:</p>
<p>          In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>          Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>          I IV V</p>
<p>          where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and <br />dominant of<br />    the<br />        scale.</p>
<p>          1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves <br />to the<br />        tonic (Gm)<br />          at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this <br />interesting<br />        because<br />          usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />    follow<br />        some<br />          chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards <br />the<br />    end.</p>
<p>          2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />    (nice..<br />        different<br />          from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>          3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />    (Ninaiththathu<br />          paLiththathu) .. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />III-<br />    V-IV-<br />        VII<br />          resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>          4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression <br />before<br />        getting to<br />          IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that.<br />    Creates<br />        a<br />          certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to <br />the I,<br />        which is<br />          done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I <br />have<br />        found that<br />          I usually love songs that do this uniformally. . (also songs<br />    where<br />        there are<br />          scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>          5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the <br />mix.<br />        Now this is<br />          obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />    Maestro<br />        that :)<br />          It creates a very nice effect.</p>

<p>   Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was Madurai<br />   Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was Ghantasala<br />   at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let the<br />   movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing.<br />   Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in<br />   Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great<br />   but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or<br />   cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he has used<br />   many ragas and many singers.</p>
<p>   Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies<br />   bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another<br />   one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie<br />   mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African<br />   samba music is another treat.</p>
<p>   KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's<br />   guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai<br />   AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute<br />   work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to<br />   telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone (until<br />   IR came on the seen again).</p>

<p>       Arun, I learnt classical music from movies too!! I had a strong<br />       aversion of the way classical music was taught - rigid ways with<br />       little creative force and hero worship of musicians,strong caste<br />       factors - so I learnt from movies and after grade 9 attended<br />   classes<br />       and learnt formally. Some generic fyi on old tamil classical<br />   songs in<br />       case you are interested...</p>
<p>       G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman(SV Sekar's dad who gave music for<br />   MSS's<br />       Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin<br />       Mummoorthigal in those days.</p>
<p>       Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - Devadas is an<br />       evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's<br />   unbearable<br />       Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the most<br />       famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU<br />   Chinnappa's<br />       clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />       (Shankarabharanam). I can't recall more on CR right away. G<br />       Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's guru.<br />       Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna<br />       Ramayanam...Wow what a list and most of them classical treats. Who<br />       can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama<br />   puthiran<br />       or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used Mukari<br />   that<br />       way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the MLV<br />   song to<br />       Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai Veeran.</p>
<p>       There are amazing directors in other languages as far as classical<br />       music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala in<br />       Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil<br />       too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.</p>
<p>       IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to<br />   give<br />       him credit for that, and his creativity/innovation is perhaps<br />       unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which<br />   unfortunately<br />       is very forgotten.</p>

<p>             Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and<br />   discusses<br />       the<br />           tamil<br />             song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/progression<br />       etc. I<br />           doubt it<br />             will be of too much interest to people other than those who<br />       follow<br />           tamil<br />             songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>             I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to<br />   the<br />           song "Madai<br />             Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>             I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is<br />   the<br />           original one<br />             since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but<br />   it<br />           still works.<br />             If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />       around.</p>
<p>             Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>             A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>             The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>             A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>             (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have<br />   found<br />       that<br />           it<br />             usually helps to understand the scale first before going on<br />   to<br />       the<br />           chords).</p>
<p>             The other thing to note is that you could call this the<br />   A#maj<br />       Scale<br />           or the<br />             Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj<br />   scale.<br />       (On<br />           the<br />             fretboard, you can identify this by going down three<br />   semitones<br />           (half notes)<br />             to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and<br />       chords<br />           remain<br />             the same except that you would start from G instead of A#.<br />   On<br />       second<br />             thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />       this<br />           the Gmin<br />             Scale.</p>
<p>             Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief<br />   discussion:</p>

<p>             Dm A# Gm A#<br />             Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>             Cm Cm Cm A#<br />             Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>             A# A# A# Cm<br />             Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>             Cm Dm<br />             YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>             The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>             A few things to note:</p>
<p>             In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>             Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>             I IV V</p>
<p>             where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and<br />   dominant of<br />       the<br />           scale.</p>
<p>             1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves<br />   to the<br />           tonic (Gm)<br />             at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this<br />   interesting<br />           because<br />             usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />       follow<br />           some<br />             chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards<br />   the<br />       end.</p>
<p>             2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />       (nice..<br />           different<br />             from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>             3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />       (Ninaiththathu<br />             paLiththathu).. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />   III-<br />       V-IV-<br />           VII<br />             resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>             4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression<br />   before<br />           getting to<br />             IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that.<br />       Creates<br />           a<br />             certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to<br />   the I,<br />           which is<br />             done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I<br />   have<br />           found that<br />             I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. (also songs<br />       where<br />           there are<br />             scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>             5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the<br />   mix.<br />           Now this is<br />             obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />       Maestro<br />           that :)<br />             It creates a very nice effect.</p>

        <p>Arun,</p>
<p>I have high regards / respects to all the music doyens. But in my<br />opinion one cannot put the work of IR in simple words, as mentioned in your<br />mail. He took the "BEST" from every form of music - Carnatic / Hindustani /<br />Western Classical. He used this knowledge and fused them together when he<br />composed songs.</p>
<p>For a man from Pannaipuram village who never had any formal training in<br />music, learning different forms of music when he had no money in his pocket,<br />analyzing them and picking the best of every music and applying them to film<br />music ... This is some thing very great. This is easier said than done. If I<br />start explaining them it will become a over dose of IR to this forum. For me<br />other musicians great people /doyens and this man is a LEGEND.</p>

<p>   Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was Madurai<br />   Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was Ghantasala<br />   at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let the<br />   movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing.<br />   Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in<br />   Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great<br />   but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or<br />   cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he has used<br />   many ragas and many singers.</p>
<p>   Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies<br />   bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another<br />   one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie<br />   mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African<br />   samba music is another treat.</p>
<p>   KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's<br />   guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai<br />   AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute<br />   work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to<br />   telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone (until<br />   IR came on the seen again).</p>

<p>       Arun, I learnt classical music from movies too!! I had a strong<br />       aversion of the way classical music was taught - rigid ways with<br />       little creative force and hero worship of musicians,strong caste<br />       factors - so I learnt from movies and after grade 9 attended<br />   classes<br />       and learnt formally. Some generic fyi on old tamil classical<br />   songs in<br />       case you are interested...</p>
<p>       G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman(SV Sekar's dad who gave music for<br />   MSS's<br />       Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin<br />       Mummoorthigal in those days.</p>
<p>       Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - Devadas is an<br />       evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's<br />   unbearable<br />       Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the most<br />       famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU<br />   Chinnappa's<br />       clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />       (Shankarabharanam). I can't recall more on CR right away. G<br />       Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's guru.<br />       Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna<br />       Ramayanam...Wow what a list and most of them classical treats. Who<br />       can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama<br />   puthiran<br />       or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used Mukari<br />   that<br />       way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the MLV<br />   song to<br />       Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai Veeran.</p>
<p>       There are amazing directors in other languages as far as classical<br />       music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala in<br />       Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil<br />       too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.</p>
<p>       IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to<br />   give<br />       him credit for that, and his creativity/innovation is perhaps<br />       unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which<br />   unfortunately<br />       is very forgotten.</p>

<p>             Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and<br />   discusses<br />       the<br />           tamil<br />             song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/progression<br />       etc. I<br />           doubt it<br />             will be of too much interest to people other than those who<br />       follow<br />           tamil<br />             songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>             I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to<br />   the<br />           song "Madai<br />             Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>             I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is<br />   the<br />           original one<br />             since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but<br />   it<br />           still works.<br />             If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />       around.</p>
<p>             Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>             A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>             The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>             A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>             (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have<br />   found<br />       that<br />           it<br />             usually helps to understand the scale first before going on<br />   to<br />       the<br />           chords).</p>
<p>             The other thing to note is that you could call this the<br />   A#maj<br />       Scale<br />           or the<br />             Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj<br />   scale.<br />       (On<br />           the<br />             fretboard, you can identify this by going down three<br />   semitones<br />           (half notes)<br />             to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and<br />       chords<br />           remain<br />             the same except that you would start from G instead of A#.<br />   On<br />       second<br />             thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />       this<br />           the Gmin<br />             Scale.</p>
<p>             Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief<br />   discussion:</p>
<p>             Dm Gm A# Dm<br />             Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>

<p>             Cm Dm<br />             YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>             The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>             A few things to note:</p>
<p>             In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>             Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>             I IV V</p>
<p>             where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and<br />   dominant of<br />       the<br />           scale.</p>
<p>             1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves<br />   to the<br />           tonic (Gm)<br />             at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this<br />   interesting<br />           because<br />             usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />       follow<br />           some<br />             chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards<br />   the<br />       end.</p>
<p>             2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />       (nice..<br />           different<br />             from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>             3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />       (Ninaiththathu<br />             paLiththathu).. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />   III-<br />       V-IV-<br />           VII<br />             resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>             4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression<br />   before<br />           getting to<br />             IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that.<br />       Creates<br />           a<br />             certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to<br />   the I,<br />           which is<br />             done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I<br />   have<br />           found that<br />             I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. (also songs<br />       where<br />           there are<br />             scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>             5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the<br />   mix.<br />           Now this is<br />             obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />       Maestro<br />           that :)<br />             It creates a very nice effect.</p>

        <p>A veritable fount of information!:) Thanks for all that.<br />I always wondered why KVM didn't do more movies in Tamizh.. Shankarabharanam<br />was KVM right?<br />Great songs!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was Madurai<br />  Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was Ghantasala<br />  at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let the<br />  movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing.<br />  Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in<br />  Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great<br />  but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or<br />  cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he has used<br />  many ragas and many singers.</p>
<p>  Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies<br />  bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another<br />  one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie<br />  mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African<br />  samba music is another treat.</p>
<p>  KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's<br />  guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai<br />  AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute<br />  work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to<br />  telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone (until<br />  IR came on the seen again).</p>

<p>      Arun, I learnt classical music from movies too!! I had a strong<br />      aversion of the way classical music was taught - rigid ways with<br />      little creative force and hero worship of musicians,strong caste<br />      factors - so I learnt from movies and after grade 9 attended<br />  classes<br />      and learnt formally. Some generic fyi on old tamil classical<br />  songs in<br />      case you are interested...</p>
<p>      G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman(SV Sekar's dad who gave music for<br />  MSS's<br />      Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin<br />      Mummoorthigal in those days.</p>
<p>      Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - Devadas is an<br />      evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's<br />  unbearable<br />      Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the most<br />      famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU<br />  Chinnappa's<br />      clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />      (Shankarabharanam). I can't recall more on CR right away. G<br />      Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's guru.<br />      Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna<br />      Ramayanam...Wow what a list and most of them classical treats. Who<br />      can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama<br />  puthiran<br />      or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used Mukari<br />  that<br />      way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the MLV<br />  song to<br />      Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai Veeran.</p>
<p>      There are amazing directors in other languages as far as classical<br />      music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala in<br />      Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil<br />      too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.</p>
<p>      IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to<br />  give<br />      him credit for that, and his creativity/innovation is perhaps<br />      unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which<br />  unfortunately<br />      is very forgotten.</p>

<p>            Aah Raja the Great... it is truly wonderful to listen to his<br />          creations and<br />            one can appreciate it at so many different levels.. carnatic<br />          classical or<br />            western.. here is something I had written on a Guitar forum<br />  on<br />      Madai<br />            Thiranthu.. this might not be everyone's cup of tea but<br />  just to<br />          give you a<br />            flavor for how we can all appreciate Raja in our own way:</p>
<p>            Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and<br />  discusses<br />      the<br />          tamil<br />            song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/progression<br />      etc. I<br />          doubt it<br />            will be of too much interest to people other than those who<br />      follow<br />          tamil<br />            songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>            I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to<br />  the<br />          song "Madai<br />            Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>            I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is<br />  the<br />          original one<br />            since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but<br />  it<br />          still works.<br />            If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />      around.</p>
<p>            Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>            A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>            The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>            A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>            (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have<br />  found<br />      that<br />          it<br />            usually helps to understand the scale first before going on<br />  to<br />      the<br />          chords).</p>
<p>            The other thing to note is that you could call this the<br />  A#maj<br />      Scale<br />          or the<br />            Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj<br />  scale.<br />      (On<br />          the<br />            fretboard, you can identify this by going down three<br />  semitones<br />          (half notes)<br />            to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and<br />      chords<br />          remain<br />            the same except that you would start from G instead of A#.<br />  On<br />      second<br />            thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />      this<br />          the Gmin<br />            Scale.</p>
<p>            Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief<br />  discussion:</p>
<p>            Dm Gm A# Dm<br />            Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>            Dm Gm A# Dm<br />            Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>
<p>            Dm Cm Gm<br />            Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram</p>
<p>            Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />            Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu</p>
<p>            Intro - 1<br />            ---------</p>
<p>            Stanza - 1<br />            ==========</p>
<p>            Dm A# Gm A#<br />            Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu</p>
<p>            Dm A# Gm A#<br />            Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>            Cm Cm Cm A#<br />            Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>            A# A# A# Cm<br />            Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>            Cm Dm<br />            YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>            The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>            A few things to note:</p>
<p>            In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>            Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>            I IV V</p>
<p>            where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and<br />  dominant of<br />      the<br />          scale.</p>
<p>            1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves<br />  to the<br />          tonic (Gm)<br />            at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this<br />  interesting<br />          because<br />            usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />      follow<br />          some<br />            chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards<br />  the<br />      end.</p>
<p>            2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />      (nice..<br />          different<br />            from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>            3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />      (Ninaiththathu<br />            paLiththathu).. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />  III-<br />      V-IV-<br />          VII<br />            resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>            4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression<br />  before<br />          getting to<br />            IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that.<br />      Creates<br />          a<br />            certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to<br />  the I,<br />          which is<br />            done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I<br />  have<br />          found that<br />            I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. (also songs<br />      where<br />          there are<br />            scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>            5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the<br />  mix.<br />          Now this is<br />            obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />      Maestro<br />          that :)<br />            It creates a very nice effect.</p>

        <p>Arun, I apologize I think Sampoorna Ramayanam was KVM. GR was Madurai <br />Veeran, Ambikapathy, Uthamaputhiran etc. Yes Lavakusa was Ghantasala <br />at his best inspired by his guru KVM. I mean you can just let the <br />movie run,close your eyes and enjoy the music it is so amazing. <br />Sandegamum Yenamma in Hindolam, and Eedu inai nammku yedhu in <br />Dhanyaasi, you could listen to them all day. Jagam Pugazhum is great <br />but ranks below these numbers. If you get a HMV Lavakusa CD or <br />cassette (tamil) I would highly recommend just to see how he has used <br />many ragas and many singers.</p>
<p>Yes he was basically telugu but in those days they made all movies <br />bilingual so much of his music is in tamil also. Mayabazar, another <br />one, the mohanam based Aaha inba nilavinile is one of the best movie <br />mohanam compositions. And Kalyana samayal saadam based on African  <br />samba music is another treat. </p>
<p>KVM..how can we forget him, with all these guys? KVM was Ghantasala's <br />guru also and partially did music for Lavakusa. Maharajan Ulagai <br />AAluvan (Karahapriya from Karnan, cut in the movie), was an absolute <br />work of genius. In his latter years actually he moved totally to <br />telugu since taste for classical music in tamil was near gone (until <br />IR came on the seen again).</p>

<p>    Arun, I learnt classical music from movies too!! I had a strong<br />    aversion of the way classical music was taught - rigid ways with<br />    little creative force and hero worship of musicians,strong caste<br />    factors - so I learnt from movies and after grade 9 attended <br />classes<br />    and learnt formally. Some generic fyi on old tamil classical <br />songs in<br />    case you are interested...</p>
<p>    G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman(SV Sekar's dad who gave music for <br />MSS's<br />    Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin<br />    Mummoorthigal in those days.</p>
<p>    Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - Devadas is an<br />    evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's <br />unbearable<br />    Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the most<br />    famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU <br />Chinnappa's<br />    clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />    (Shankarabharanam). I can't recall more on CR right away. G<br />    Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's guru.<br />    Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna<br />    Ramayanam...Wow what a list and most of them classical treats. Who<br />    can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama <br />puthiran<br />    or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used Mukari <br />that<br />    way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the MLV <br />song to<br />    Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai Veeran.</p>
<p>    There are amazing directors in other languages as far as classical<br />    music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala in<br />    Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil<br />    too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.</p>
<p>    IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to <br />give<br />    him credit for that, and his creativity/innovation is perhaps<br />    unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which <br />unfortunately<br />    is very forgotten.</p>

<p>          Aah Raja the Great... it is truly wonderful to listen to his<br />        creations and<br />          one can appreciate it at so many different levels.. carnatic<br />        classical or<br />          western.. here is something I had written on a Guitar forum <br />on<br />    Madai<br />          Thiranthu.. this might not be everyone's cup of tea but <br />just to<br />        give you a<br />          flavor for how we can all appreciate Raja in our own way:</p>
<p>          Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and <br />discusses<br />    the<br />        tamil<br />          song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/progression<br />    etc. I<br />        doubt it<br />          will be of too much interest to people other than those who<br />    follow<br />        tamil<br />          songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>          I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to <br />the<br />        song "Madai<br />          Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>          I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is <br />the<br />        original one<br />          since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but <br />it<br />        still works.<br />          If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />    around.</p>
<p>          Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>          A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>          The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>          A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>          (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have <br />found<br />    that<br />        it<br />          usually helps to understand the scale first before going on <br />to<br />    the<br />        chords).</p>
<p>          The other thing to note is that you could call this the <br />A#maj<br />    Scale<br />        or the<br />          Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj <br />scale.<br />    (On<br />        the<br />          fretboard, you can identify this by going down three <br />semitones<br />        (half notes)<br />          to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and<br />    chords<br />        remain<br />          the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. <br />On<br />    second<br />          thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />    this<br />        the Gmin<br />          Scale.</p>
<p>          Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief <br />discussion:</p>
<p>          Dm Gm A# Dm<br />          Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>          Dm Gm A# Dm<br />          Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>
<p>          Dm Cm Gm<br />          Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram</p>
<p>          Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />          Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu</p>
<p>          Intro - 1<br />          ---------</p>
<p>          Stanza - 1<br />          ==========</p>
<p>          Dm A# Gm A#<br />          Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu</p>
<p>          Dm A# Gm A#<br />          Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>          Cm Cm Cm A#<br />          Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>          A# A# A# Cm<br />          Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>          Cm Dm<br />          YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>          The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>          A few things to note:</p>
<p>          In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>          Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>          I IV V</p>
<p>          where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and <br />dominant of<br />    the<br />        scale.</p>
<p>          1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves <br />to the<br />        tonic (Gm)<br />          at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this <br />interesting<br />        because<br />          usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />    follow<br />        some<br />          chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards <br />the<br />    end.</p>
<p>          2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />    (nice..<br />        different<br />          from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>          3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />    (Ninaiththathu<br />          paLiththathu).. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-<br />III-<br />    V-IV-<br />        VII<br />          resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>          4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression <br />before<br />        getting to<br />          IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that.<br />    Creates<br />        a<br />          certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to <br />the I,<br />        which is<br />          done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I <br />have<br />        found that<br />          I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. (also songs<br />    where<br />        there are<br />          scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>          5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the <br />mix.<br />        Now this is<br />          obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />    Maestro<br />        that :)<br />          It creates a very nice effect.</p>

        <p>Thanks Malathy for that history lesson :) I have Sampoorna Ramayanam..<br />didn't know it was by Ramanathan.. I love the "Jagam pugazhum puNNiya<br />kathai" song from LavaKusa.. is that by Ghantasala?<br />I think Ghantasala has a more profound impact on Telugu film music than on<br />Tamizh.</p>

Some generic fyi on old tamil classical songs in<br />  case you are interested...</p>
<p>  G.Ramanathan, S.V.Venkatraman(SV Sekar's dad who gave music for MSS's<br />  Meera) and CR Subbaraman are called the Tamil Thirai Isayin<br />  Mummoorthigal in those days.</p>
<p>  Subbaraman composed music both in Telugu and Tamil - Devadas is an<br />  evergreen hit, although you have to tolerate Ghantasala's unbearable<br />  Tamil pronounciation to enjoy the songs. Perhaps one of the most<br />  famous numbers of Subbaramaan was Kadhal Kanirasame in PU Chinnappa's<br />  clear voice - A tamil take on Nada Thanu manisam<br />  (Shankarabharanam). I can't recall more on CR right away. G<br />  Ramanathan was just amazing, also acknowledged to be MSV's guru.<br />  Ambikapathy, Madurai Veeran,Uthama puthiran, Sampoorna<br />  Ramayanam...Wow what a list and most of them classical treats. Who<br />  can forget the Kaanada based Mullai malar mele from Uthama puthiran<br />  or even the Mukari based duet in Ambikapathy (anyone used Mukari that<br />  way??). The Ragamalika song in Sampoorna Ramayanam,or the MLV song to<br />  Aadal Kaaneero (a gorgeous Padmini's dance) in Madurai Veeran.</p>
<p>  There are amazing directors in other languages as far as classical<br />  music goes - telugu in particular. Ghantasala and Pendyala in<br />  Telugu (Ghantasala's Mayabazar and Lavakusa are treats in Tamil<br />  too).I can go on and on on this for a very very long time.</p>
<p>  IR brought back the common man to classical music - we have to give<br />  him credit for that, and his creativity/innovation is perhaps<br />  unmatched.But we have had a glorious past much of which unfortunately<br />  is very forgotten.</p>

<p>        Aah Raja the Great... it is truly wonderful to listen to his<br />      creations and<br />        one can appreciate it at so many different levels.. carnatic<br />      classical or<br />        western.. here is something I had written on a Guitar forum on<br />  Madai<br />        Thiranthu.. this might not be everyone's cup of tea but just to<br />      give you a<br />        flavor for how we can all appreciate Raja in our own way:</p>
<p>        Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and discusses<br />  the<br />      tamil<br />        song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/progression<br />  etc. I<br />      doubt it<br />        will be of too much interest to people other than those who<br />  follow<br />      tamil<br />        songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>        I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to the<br />      song "Madai<br />        Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>        I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is the<br />      original one<br />        since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but it<br />      still works.<br />        If this is not the original scale, you can always move it<br />  around.</p>
<p>        Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>        A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>        The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>        A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>        (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have found<br />  that<br />      it<br />        usually helps to understand the scale first before going on to<br />  the<br />      chords).</p>
<p>        The other thing to note is that you could call this the A#maj<br />  Scale<br />      or the<br />        Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj scale.<br />  (On<br />      the<br />        fretboard, you can identify this by going down three semitones<br />      (half notes)<br />        to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and<br />  chords<br />      remain<br />        the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. On<br />  second<br />        thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call<br />  this<br />      the Gmin<br />        Scale.</p>
<p>        Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief discussion:</p>
<p>        Dm Gm A# Dm<br />        Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>        Dm Gm A# Dm<br />        Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>
<p>        Dm Cm Gm<br />        Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram</p>
<p>        Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />        Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu</p>
<p>        Intro - 1<br />        ---------</p>
<p>        Stanza - 1<br />        ==========</p>
<p>        Dm A# Gm A#<br />        Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu</p>
<p>        Dm A# Gm A#<br />        Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>        Cm Cm Cm A#<br />        Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>        A# A# A# Cm<br />        Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>        Cm Dm<br />        YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>        The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>        A few things to note:</p>
<p>        In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>        Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>        I IV V</p>
<p>        where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and dominant of<br />  the<br />      scale.</p>
<p>        1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves to the<br />      tonic (Gm)<br />        at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this interesting<br />      because<br />        usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually<br />  follow<br />      some<br />        chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards the<br />  end.</p>
<p>        2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V<br />  (nice..<br />      different<br />        from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>        3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the<br />  (Ninaiththathu<br />        paLiththathu).. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-III-<br />  V-IV-<br />      VII<br />        resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>        4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression before<br />      getting to<br />        IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that.<br />  Creates<br />      a<br />        certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to the I,<br />      which is<br />        done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I have<br />      found that<br />        I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. (also songs<br />  where<br />      there are<br />        scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>        5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the mix.<br />      Now this is<br />        obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the<br />  Maestro<br />      that :)<br />        It creates a very nice effect.</p>
<p>        Regards,</p>

<p>    Wow Arun, I wish I could follow. I am a classical music singer <br />myself<br />    but no idea on instruments. I very much like the IR melodies<br />    mentioned ..Also true that tamil film world has had its share of<br />    classical music greats before IR also - Some of KV Mahadevan and<br />    Subbaraman's pieces are very memorable.</p>

<p>      Aah Raja the Great... it is truly wonderful to listen to his<br />    creations and<br />      one can appreciate it at so many different levels.. carnatic<br />    classical or<br />      western.. here is something I had written on a Guitar forum on <br />Madai<br />      Thiranthu.. this might not be everyone's cup of tea but just to<br />    give you a<br />      flavor for how we can all appreciate Raja in our own way:</p>
<p>      Anyway, this is a post I made to the guitar forum and discusses <br />the<br />    tamil<br />      song Madai Thiranthu and its chord construction/progression <br />etc. I<br />    doubt it<br />      will be of too much interest to people other than those who <br />follow<br />    tamil<br />      songs AND play some instrument..</p>
<p>      I thought that I would start off by posting the chords to the<br />    song "Madai<br />      Thiranthu" from Nizhalgal..</p>
<p>      I play the song in the A#maj Scale. I don't know if this is the<br />    original one<br />      since I worked out the chords for this a few years ago, but it<br />    still works.<br />      If this is not the original scale, you can always move it <br />around.</p>
<p>      Ok.. the A#maj scale consists of the following notes:</p>
<p>      A# C D D# F G A</p>
<p>      The corresponding chords are:</p>
<p>      A#, Cm, Dm, D#, F, Gm and Am-dim</p>
<p>      (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have found <br />that<br />    it<br />      usually helps to understand the scale first before going on to <br />the<br />    chords).</p>
<p>      The other thing to note is that you could call this the A#maj <br />Scale<br />    or the<br />      Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj scale. <br />(On<br />    the<br />      fretboard, you can identify this by going down three semitones<br />    (half notes)<br />      to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and <br />chords<br />    remain<br />      the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. On <br />second<br />      thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call <br />this<br />    the Gmin<br />      Scale.</p>
<p>      Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief discussion:</p>
<p>      Dm Gm A# Dm<br />      Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>      Dm Gm A# Dm<br />      Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>
<p>      Dm Cm Gm<br />      Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram</p>
<p>      Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />      Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu</p>
<p>      Intro - 1<br />      ---------</p>
<p>      Stanza - 1<br />      ==========</p>
<p>      Dm A# Gm A#<br />      Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu</p>
<p>      Dm A# Gm A#<br />      Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>      Cm Cm Cm A#<br />      Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>      A# A# A# Cm<br />      Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>      Cm Dm<br />      YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>      The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>      A few things to note:</p>
<p>      In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>      Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>      I IV V</p>
<p>      where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and dominant of <br />the<br />    scale.</p>
<p>      1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves to the<br />    tonic (Gm)<br />      at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this interesting<br />    because<br />      usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually <br />follow<br />    some<br />      chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards the <br />end.</p>
<p>      2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V <br />(nice..<br />    different<br />      from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>      3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the <br />(Ninaiththathu<br />      paLiththathu).. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-III-<br />V-IV-<br />    VII<br />      resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>      4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression before<br />    getting to<br />      IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that. <br />Creates<br />    a<br />      certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to the I,<br />    which is<br />      done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I have<br />    found that<br />      I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. (also songs <br />where<br />    there are<br />      scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>      5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the mix.<br />    Now this is<br />      obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the <br />Maestro<br />    that :)<br />      It creates a very nice effect.</p>

<p>Udanx,</p>
<p>Thanks for refreshing. I remember Sindhu Bhairavi and Sagara Sangamam<br />but Rudraveena, dont remember. Sorry for that slip. I always feel that<br />for the work he has done in Tamil films, he should have got more and<br />more, but just one (in Tamil).... surely a sad state. Thats what I had<br />in my mind always and in that thought missed Sindhu Bhairavi. :)</p>
<p>I never said I cant appreicate carnatic music. I do enjoy it, but<br />without the knowledge of ragam and other grammer. I enjoy it as pure<br />music. thats all. You know what, I tried learning flute twice so<br />far...first time I didnt get a good teacher..so dropped in a couple of<br />months. Again last year I started with a good teacher(a student of<br />Ramani), continued for sometime but by then, I had to come to the US<br />and my teacher went to Singapore :(..nalla raasi than enakku...</p>

<p>    (I apologize for being a little pedantic here but I have found that<br />  it<br />    usually helps to understand the scale first before going on to the<br />  chords).</p>
<p>    The other thing to note is that you could call this the A#maj Scale<br />  or the<br />    Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj scale. (On<br />  the<br />    fretboard, you can identify this by going down three semitones<br />  (half notes)<br />    to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and chords<br />  remain<br />    the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. On second<br />    thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call this<br />  the Gmin<br />    Scale.</p>
<p>    Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief discussion:</p>
<p>    Dm Gm A# Dm<br />    Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>    Dm Gm A# Dm<br />    Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>
<p>    Dm Cm Gm<br />    Isai Kalaingan, yen aasaigaL aayiram</p>
<p>    Gm A# Dm Cm F<br />    Ninaiththathu PaLiththathu</p>
<p>    Intro - 1<br />    ---------</p>
<p>    Stanza - 1<br />    ==========</p>
<p>    Dm A# Gm A#<br />    Kaalam KaNinthathu, kathavugaL thiRanthathu</p>
<p>    Dm A# Gm A#<br />    Nyaanam ViLainthathu, nal Isai piRanthathu</p>
<p>    Cm Cm Cm A#<br />    Puthu raagam padaippathaale, Naanum iRaivanE,</p>
<p>    A# A# A# Cm<br />    Isaikkena IsaigindRa rasigargaL raajjiyam,</p>
<p>    Cm Dm<br />    YenakkE thaan.</p>
<p>    The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>    A few things to note:</p>
<p>    In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>    Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>    I IV V</p>
<p>    where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and dominant of the<br />  scale.</p>
<p>    1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves to the<br />  tonic (Gm)<br />    at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this interesting<br />  because<br />    usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually follow<br />  some<br />    chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards the end.</p>
<p>    2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V (nice..<br />  different<br />    from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>    3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the (Ninaiththathu<br />    paLiththathu).. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-III-V-IV-<br />  VII<br />    resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>    4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression before<br />  getting to<br />    IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that. Creates<br />  a<br />    certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to the I,<br />  which is<br />    done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I have<br />  found that<br />    I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. (also songs where<br />  there are<br />    scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>
<p>    5. In the second interlude, Raja subtly adds am F# into the mix.<br />  Now this is<br />    obviously outside the scale but nobody bothered to tell the Maestro<br />  that :)<br />    It creates a very nice effect.</p>

<p>The other thing to note is that you could call this the A#maj Scale or the<br />Gmin Scale. The Gmin is the relative minor of the A#maj scale. (On the<br />fretboard, you can identify this by going down three semitones (half notes)<br />to find the relative minor of a major scale). The notes and chords remain<br />the same except that you would start from G instead of A#. On second<br />thoughts, seeing how the song shapes up, I would rather call this the Gmin<br />Scale.</p>
<p>Anyway, let me give the chords first before a brief discussion:</p>
<p>Dm Gm A# Dm<br />Madai thiRanthu, Thaavum nathi alai naan,</p>
<p>Dm Gm A# Dm<br />Manam thiRanthu, koovum thiru kuyil naan,</p>

<p>The second stanza is similar.</p>
<p>A few things to note:</p>
<p>In the Gmin Scale, the chords are so:</p>
<p>Gm Amaj-dim A# Cm Dm D# F</p>
<p>I IV V</p>
<p>where I, IV and V denote the tonic, subdominant and dominant of the scale.</p>
<p>1. The piece starts off with the V (Dm) and then resolves to the tonic (Gm)<br />at the very beginning (Madai Thiranthu). I find this interesting because<br />usually, people start off a song with the tonic and usually follow some<br />chord progression, resoving it to the tonic again towards the end.</p>
<p>2. The chord progression in the first lines is I - III - V (nice.. different<br />from the usual I-IV-V.</p>
<p>3. I like the resolution to tonic at the end of the (Ninaiththathu<br />paLiththathu).. as Gm - A# - Dm - Cm - F which follows a I-III-V-IV-VII<br />resolving to I at the next stanza.</p>
<p>4. The stanzas have the same basic I-III-V progression before getting to<br />IV-V at the end (Cm - Dm) .. and letting it hang like that. Creates a<br />certain tension that can ONLY be released by resolving to the I, which is<br />done at the next "Madai Thiranthu" when the Gm is played. I have found that<br />I usually love songs that do this uniformally.. (also songs where there are<br />scale changes... but thats for another day).</p>

<p>  Is there an Ilayaraja fan in you. Join the club mate. I am not sure <br />about IR<br />  composing all the songs in a movie in 20 minutes.But I do have a <br />couple of<br />  trivia about IR</p>
<p>  1. He composed songs for Kadhal Oviyum (Bharathiraja / IR/ <br />Vairamuthu in<br />  which Radh and a blind man play the lead role) in two days and <br />that too due<br />  to non availability of SPB. All the songs in the movie are super <br />duper hit.<br />  2. Who can forget "Ilamai yenum Poongadru" song (This song is <br />for Sridevi<br />  and the actor who plays Radhika's fathers role in the latest <br />serial) from<br />  the film "Pagalil oru Iravu" After the song lyrics was handed <br />over to IR he<br />  composed the tunes and the recorded the song in 17 minutes!<br />  3. In the film "Sindhu Bhairavi" when ever Suhasini is in scene <br />the<br />  background score is based on Sindhu Bhairavi Raham. He will <br />display all the<br />  facets of that Raga in that film. All IR fans would have noticed <br />that.<br />  4. Mari Mari Ninne song in Sindhu Bhairavi. The original raham <br />by Saint<br />  Tyagaraja for this song was Kambodhi. But this man had the <br />audacity to<br />  compose the song based on Saramathi. If I have to explain in <br />cricketing<br />  terms - Play a cover drive on a over pitched ball. Hook a ball <br />when it is<br />  short pitched and raising. This is the cricketing grammar. But <br />this man<br />  composing Mari Mari Ninne in Saramathi is like hooking a over <br />pitched<br />  delivery to the square leg boundary for a clean six!<br />  5. Experimenting with Ragas like composing a song on a raga <br />which is<br />  supposed to depict Sad mood. "Kandu Pudichen Kandhu Pudichen" <br />from Guru<br />  Sishyan. This is based on Bhavapriya Raga and this raga is full <br />of sorrow<br />  mood.<br />  6. Composing songs on rare ragas which others dare to touch like<br />  "Simhendra Madhyamam", "Kanakangi" (This is the 1st raga in the <br />Melakartha),<br />  "Natakapriya" , "Ramapriya", "Reethigowlai" , "Rasikapriya" (72nd <br />Melakarta<br />  Raga)</p>

        <p>I must confess my ignorance as far as IR melodies go. I do know quite a biton Kaviarasar related anecdotes. The marudhamalai maamani song used to be a personal favorite of MAdurai Somu and he ended every concert unfailingly with it. The 'devarin kulam kaakum..' line was accidental, not intentional.KD was out of money to perform his last daughter's wedding which was one week away. The usual practice was for the producer to pay the song writer after all songs were penned and set to tune. There was some time left for Deivam songs - he accidentally wrote the line Devarin kulam kakkum velayya, which pleased chinnappa devar so much that he offered 1 lakh on the spot and the wedding went off with great pomp and show. <br />?<br />Most of KD's songs have hidden meanings - Sivakaami maganidamum is refereceto Kamaraj, Nalamdaana is for Arignar Anna, Poyille pirandu is for his girlfriend and actress Devika, Neeyum?Naanuma kanna is for his nephew Panju Arunachalam, and so on.Will write more tonight.<br />?<br />On the late Kunnakkudi, as Venkat said he?was never accepted and acknowledged by the classical music community - although he was very creative he was also an extremely good classical musician, occasionally even the hardenedcritic Subbudu acknowledged that.Salutations and may his soul rest in peace.?</p>

<p>Sathish,</p>
<p>Well said. Thats the right word LEGENDS!</p>
<p>Is there an Ilayaraja fan in you. Join the club mate. I am not sure about IR composing all the songs in a movie in 20 minutes.But I do have a couple of trivia about IR</p>
<p>He composed songs for Kadhal Oviyum (Bharathiraja / IR/ Vairamuthu in whichRadh and a blind man play the lead role) in two days and that too due to non?availability?of SPB. All the songs in the movie are super duper hit.<br />Who can forget "Ilamai yenum Poongadru" song (This song is for Sridevi and the actor who plays Radhika's fathers role in the latest serial) from the film "Pagalil oru Iravu" After the song lyrics was handed over to IR he composed the tunes and the recorded the song in 17 minutes!<br />In the film "Sindhu Bhairavi" when ever Suhasini is in scene the backgroundscore is based on Sindhu Bhairavi Raham. He will display all the facets ofthat Raga in that film. All IR fans would have noticed that.<br />Mari Mari Ninne song in Sindhu Bhairavi. The original raham by Saint Tyagaraja for this song was Kambodhi. But this man had the?audacity to compose the song based on Saramathi. If I have to explain in cricketing terms - Play a cover drive on a over pitched ball. Hook a ball when it is short pitched and raising. This is the cricketing?grammar. But this man composing Mari Mari Ninne in Saramathi is like hooking a over pitched delivery to the square leg boundary for a clean six!<br />Experimenting with Ragas like composing a song on a raga which is supposed to depict Sad mood. "Kandu Pudichen Kandhu Pudichen" from Guru Sishyan. This is based on Bhavapriya Raga and this raga is full of sorrow mood.<br />Composing songs on rare ragas which others dare to touch like "Simhendra Madhyamam", "Kanakangi" (This is the 1st raga in the Melakartha), "Natakapriya", "Ramapriya", "Reethigowlai", "Rasikapriya"(72nd Melakarta Raga)<br />Laters!</p>
