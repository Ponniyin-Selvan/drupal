<p>When K. R. A. Narasiah recently spoke at the Stage Archaeology <br />Department's monthly lecture forum on `Early Navigation and Ships of <br />Tamil Nadu', this former Chief Engineer, Ports, and an international <br />maritime consultant, whose hobby is now writing about the <br />historical, showed only two pictures of ships prior to the colonial <br />era. One was a sketch from Colonising Java by K.N. Pannikkar and the <br />other was the picture which appeared in these columns on August 1. <br />The former was based on the bas relief in Borobudur. The latter, <br />Narasiah regretted, when we chatted about his talk, had been rather <br />`abbreviated' in the reproduction. I make good that lapse by <br />reproducing the full picture here, anchor, fish, keel and all. The <br />ship, however, he did not think was an Indian sailing vessel. </p>
<p>Narasiah, who had spent a couple of years with the World Bank in <br />Cambodia, had seen several bas reliefs of ships and sailors in <br />Angkor Wat. These, he had been told, were representations of 12th <br />Century naval battles between the Khmers and the Chams. The former <br />were heirs to a kingdom which drew its inspiration from India, the <br />latter from the Chinese. The Chola maritime tradition, which was the <br />greatest of the Tamil maritime traditions, according to Narasiah, <br />coincided with this period when it was part of Southeast Asian <br />maritime history, with Chola expansionism at the time stretching <br />from Malacca to present-day Vietnam by way of Sumatra and Java. </p>
<p>Predating Chola maritime adventures were the Pallava ships which <br />sailed from Mamallapuam and Mylapore to these lands of the east and <br />which could well have influenced the predecessors of the Khmers. In <br />this context, whether the ships at Angkor Wat were Khmer or Cham, <br />their designing and navigational skills could very well have derived <br />from the Pallavas and the Cholas. Be that as it may, if the Angkor <br />Wat ship in my picture was Khmer or Cham, we are then once again <br />down to one representation anywhere of a pre-colonial Tamil ship, <br />the one at Borobudur. I doubt whether the dhonis found on some <br />Pandya coins could have carried armies as far as the East Indies. </p>
<p>Offering some details about early Tamil maritime history, Narasiah <br />pointed out that outward sailings were in January-February and some <br />of the major ports were between Kodikkarai (Point Calimere) and <br />Tondi. The Archaeological Department has itself been excavating at <br />Korkai and Alangulam, near Ramanathapuram, where they have found <br />several Roman relics. But this tends to draw the focus away from <br />Chola Nadu to Pandya Nadu. But be they Chera, Chola, Pandya or <br />Pallava sailors, they all had a heritage of navigatory skills, using <br />tamed birds to search for shore, the smell of the air, and the rule <br />of thumb ( veral kanakku) to follow the eight major stars and the 48 <br />minor ones. </p>
<p>One thing I forgot to ask Narasiah was the source of timber for <br />early Tamil ships. Iluppai and Punnai are found in Tamaizhagam, but <br />teak? Is teak native to this part of the country, or was it <br />imported? And if so, how? </p>

        <p>Hi bala sir</p>
<p>in the last link mentioned,the author has translated kandalur <br />shala ...as the roads of kandalur? shouldnt it be translated as <br />school ( shalai .sanskrit i/o salai tamil??)</p>
<p>rgds<br />vj</p>
<p>After Cenkuttuvan, the power of the Cera kingdom<br />appears to have been eclipsed by that of the Pandyas,<br />and an almost impenetrable veil is cast over Cera<br />naval operations till we come down to the palmy days<br />that in the twelfth year of the reign of Rajaraja I,<br />the Cera fleet fought with the Cola navy in the<br />'Roads of Kandalur,' but was routed. The Cera navy<br />was no doubt weakened by this defeat. But it survived<br />the shock, and in the time of Rajadhiraja (1042-52<br />A.D.) it again fought its Cola rival at<br />Kandalur-salai, "on the never-decreasing ocean." This<br />second venture was attended with no better fate than<br />the first. The Cera fleet was again defeated and<br />probably destroyed.(3)</p>

<p>    When K. R. A. Narasiah recently spoke at the Stage Archaeology <br />    Department's monthly lecture forum on `Early Navigation and <br />Ships <br />  of <br />    Tamil Nadu', this former Chief Engineer, Ports, and an <br />  international <br />    maritime consultant, whose hobby is now writing about the <br />    historical, showed only two pictures of ships prior to the <br />  colonial <br />    era. One was a sketch from Colonising Java by K.N. Pannikkar and <br />  the <br />    other was the picture which appeared in these columns on August <br />1. <br />    The former was based on the bas relief in Borobudur. The latter, <br />    Narasiah regretted, when we chatted about his talk, had been <br />  rather <br />    `abbreviated' in the reproduction. I make good that lapse by <br />    reproducing the full picture here, anchor, fish, keel and all. <br />The <br />    ship, however, he did not think was an Indian sailing vessel. </p>
<p>    Narasiah, who had spent a couple of years with the World Bank in <br />    Cambodia, had seen several bas reliefs of ships and sailors in <br />    Angkor Wat. These, he had been told, were representations of <br />12th <br />    Century naval battles between the Khmers and the Chams. The <br />former <br />    were heirs to a kingdom which drew its inspiration from India, <br />the <br />    latter from the Chinese. The Chola maritime tradition, which was <br />  the <br />    greatest of the Tamil maritime traditions, according to <br />Narasiah, <br />    coincided with this period when it was part of Southeast Asian <br />    maritime history, with Chola expansionism at the time stretching <br />    from Malacca to present-day Vietnam by way of Sumatra and Java. </p>
<p>    Predating Chola maritime adventures were the Pallava ships which <br />    sailed from Mamallapuam and Mylapore to these lands of the east <br />  and <br />    which could well have influenced the predecessors of the Khmers. <br />  In <br />    this context, whether the ships at Angkor Wat were Khmer or <br />Cham, <br />    their designing and navigational skills could very well have <br />  derived <br />    from the Pallavas and the Cholas. Be that as it may, if the <br />Angkor <br />    Wat ship in my picture was Khmer or Cham, we are then once again <br />    down to one representation anywhere of a pre-colonial Tamil <br />ship, <br />    the one at Borobudur. I doubt whether the dhonis found on some <br />    Pandya coins could have carried armies as far as the East <br />Indies. </p>
<p>    Offering some details about early Tamil maritime history, <br />Narasiah <br />    pointed out that outward sailings were in January-February and <br />  some <br />    of the major ports were between Kodikkarai (Point Calimere) and <br />    Tondi. The Archaeological Department has itself been excavating <br />at <br />    Korkai and Alangulam, near Ramanathapuram, where they have found <br />    several Roman relics. But this tends to draw the focus away from <br />    Chola Nadu to Pandya Nadu. But be they Chera, Chola, Pandya or <br />    Pallava sailors, they all had a heritage of navigatory skills, <br />  using <br />    tamed birds to search for shore, the smell of the air, and the <br />  rule <br />    of thumb ( veral kanakku) to follow the eight major stars and <br />the <br />  48 <br />    minor ones. </p>
<p>    One thing I forgot to ask Narasiah was the source of timber for <br />    early Tamil ships. Iluppai and Punnai are found in Tamaizhagam, <br />  but <br />    teak? Is teak native to this part of the country, or was it <br />    imported? And if so, how?</p></vj_episteme@></p></blockquote>

        <p>Thanks for your nice article.</p>
<p>Recently ,i was at the residence of Narasiah sir for more than two <br />hours had a long discussions on orissan maritime Activities.</p>
<p>Orissa timebers are famous for ship building due to their massive <br />forests and natural harbour.</p>
<p>Pipili,dhamara,palura,maikkapattinam ports and many more area are <br />famous for ship building.</p>
<p>Our friend ER.DP.Pati compiled a log book with indian coastal map <br />starting from 1680 berkely ship to till 1940.</p>
<p>Recently i gave a copy to tanjore tamil university marine archealogy <br />department.</p>
<p>Mr.Adiyaman Professional under sea diver from Tanjore university is <br />one of the few ,who specialised in marine archealogy in India</p>

<p>  When K. R. A. Narasiah recently spoke at the Stage Archaeology <br />  Department's monthly lecture forum on `Early Navigation and Ships <br />of <br />  Tamil Nadu', this former Chief Engineer, Ports, and an <br />international <br />  maritime consultant, whose hobby is now writing about the <br />  historical, showed only two pictures of ships prior to the colonial <br />  era. One was a sketch from Colonising Java by K.N. Pannikkar and <br />the <br />  other was the picture which appeared in these columns on August 1. <br />  The former was based on the bas relief in Borobudur. The latter, <br />  Narasiah regretted, when we chatted about his talk, had been rather <br />  `abbreviated' in the reproduction. I make good that lapse by <br />  reproducing the full picture here, anchor, fish, keel and all. The <br />  ship, however, he did not think was an Indian sailing vessel. </p>
<p>  Narasiah, who had spent a couple of years with the World Bank in <br />  Cambodia, had seen several bas reliefs of ships and sailors in <br />  Angkor Wat. These, he had been told, were representations of 12th <br />  Century naval battles between the Khmers and the Chams. The former <br />  were heirs to a kingdom which drew its inspiration from India, the <br />  latter from the Chinese. The Chola maritime tradition, which was <br />the <br />  greatest of the Tamil maritime traditions, according to Narasiah, <br />  coincided with this period when it was part of Southeast Asian <br />  maritime history, with Chola expansionism at the time stretching <br />  from Malacca to present-day Vietnam by way of Sumatra and Java. </p>
<p>  Predating Chola maritime adventures were the Pallava ships which <br />  sailed from Mamallapuam and Mylapore to these lands of the east and <br />  which could well have influenced the predecessors of the Khmers. In <br />  this context, whether the ships at Angkor Wat were Khmer or Cham, <br />  their designing and navigational skills could very well have <br />derived <br />  from the Pallavas and the Cholas. Be that as it may, if the Angkor <br />  Wat ship in my picture was Khmer or Cham, we are then once again <br />  down to one representation anywhere of a pre-colonial Tamil ship, <br />  the one at Borobudur. I doubt whether the dhonis found on some <br />  Pandya coins could have carried armies as far as the East Indies. </p>
<p>  Offering some details about early Tamil maritime history, Narasiah <br />  pointed out that outward sailings were in January-February and some <br />  of the major ports were between Kodikkarai (Point Calimere) and <br />  Tondi. The Archaeological Department has itself been excavating at <br />  Korkai and Alangulam, near Ramanathapuram, where they have found <br />  several Roman relics. But this tends to draw the focus away from <br />  Chola Nadu to Pandya Nadu. But be they Chera, Chola, Pandya or <br />  Pallava sailors, they all had a heritage of navigatory skills, <br />using <br />  tamed birds to search for shore, the smell of the air, and the rule <br />  of thumb ( veral kanakku) to follow the eight major stars and the <br />48 <br />  minor ones. </p>
<p>  One thing I forgot to ask Narasiah was the source of timber for <br />  early Tamil ships. Iluppai and Punnai are found in Tamaizhagam, but <br />  teak? Is teak native to this part of the country, or was it <br />  imported? And if so, how?</p>
