</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hello friends,<br />This mail may be a slight deviation from the objective of this <br />group. But I personally feel that we, as the people talking about <br />India's history &amp; culture should take a note on this.      <br />You all would be aware of the case of Manjunath Shanmugham, a young <br />lad killed in Lucknow. His offence being his attitude to keep up his <br />honesty. While I was watching this news on NDTV i was really shocked to <br />notice an SMS which read thus "May be this is the right time to teach <br />our students 'Honesty is not the best policy'." Is that so. Where are <br />we heading to? <br />But giving this a thought, yesterday we lost a Satyendra Dubey in <br />Bihar and today we lose a Manjunath Shanmugham,all for the greedy <br />hunger of the devil called corruption, and tomorrow.....? Two things <br />may happen, either brain drain (which happens even now, but will be <br />worse tomorrow) or people with attitude like 'while in Rome be a <br />Roman'. So Where will be our culture? What are we going to do?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Anusha. </p>

        <p>Dear friend Mr. Venkat dhiwakar,</p>
<p>Nothing is better said.</p>
<p>There is one thing. People like me, who have lived a major part of <br />our lives already (I am 66 years old) can take risks, wanted but <br />unwarranted. If and when some like minded people join me in a <br />group, so that we somehow or other (deduce your own meaning)punish <br />the corrupt, ourselves, without depending on official aid, we can <br />slowly eradicate this evil. I am ready, willing and able. (RAW)<br />Suffering on any account, also, is not new to me.</p>
<p>It is because of the punitive factor, Singapore where I live now, <br />has progressed. This is know as a "fine" city, because each and <br />every offence, even mistakes, do get proper punishment. Some <br />punishments are so severe, it is better not to talk about it even in <br />emails. But the country thrived and I have watched it closely for <br />the last thirty years. I have moved in only recently, but I was a <br />regular visitor all these years.</p>
<p>There used to be floods here, like the one faced by Tamilnadu <br />recently, about 25 years before. But prompt and efficient action <br />taken as "flood control measures" has solved this problem. However <br />heavy the rain is, not even a small pool of water stagnates anywhere <br />in the city, but reaches the sea through well built canal systems. I <br />do remember the days when I used to wade through knee deep water in <br />many areas, regularly, about 30 years ago. Today it is a different <br />story. Tough discipline and constructional attitude has brought <br />this country up. Corruption is met with an iron fist.</p>
<p>Our country is too large, and control by a few officials is <br />difficult. But plunishment to even a few, (really severe punishment <br />like <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  days) meted out by a team of volunteers, make others shiver <br />and stay away from corruption.</acronym></p>
<p>Let some youngsters get ready and contact me in private, we shall <br />begin a crusade !</p>
<p>Bravo, my friends. We CAN do it.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>  Right from a younger age, I refused to accept corruption as a way <br />of <br />  life. I built a house, reasonably large myself, without ever <br />paying <br />  anyone a paisa towards bribe. I was only a very ordinary <br />individual <br />  but I had made up my mind that I won't bribe anyone. Same way I <br />  never accepted any bribe at any time despite being in a Service <br />  industry with lot of opportunities. Not paying a bribe resulted <br />in <br />  more delays and denials, but I always succeeded ultimately.  <br />  Most people either do not want to suffer the delay or harassment, <br />or <br />  do not mind, because they too accept some gratification sometime <br />in <br />  their life or other</p>
<p>  If only, one decides to personally fight it at all levels, and <br />first <br />  makes up his mind on the subject, the problem becomes simple and <br />one <br />  can win over and change the entire populace. First it has to <br />begin <br />  with oneself. For this one has to be honest to oneself - apart <br />from <br />  being honest to others. A very difficult proposition, but not an <br />  impossible one. I suffered all my younger life because of this, <br />but <br />  the rewards (from above - for those who believe in HIM) were <br />  greater. Luckily I have chosen and live in a country where <br />  corruption is at very negligible minimum levels and thus escape <br />  further corruption, but I visit India very often, but absoutely <br />  refuse to submit to corruption, I do not mind the delays or <br />  detentions and I do love India. I shall only be an Indian despite <br />  other choice and try to do my bit whenever possible to improve the <br />  situation in my motherland.</p>
<p>  Love and best wishes to all of you, most of you are very young and <br />  can easily change the society, if only you are determined about it.</p>

        <p>Hai friends,</p>
<p>For the past few days lot of articles on &#145;corruption&#146; appears in the group. I would like to put corruption as part and parcel of our life which has to be some how removed from us, yet we are adjusting as well moving forward with our way of life.

<p>A small stat. (only for information other wise just waste) For Bofors scam, it was said the actual money squandered was only Rs.67 crores (Yet they call this as commission and not corruption).

        <p>I am mostly a silent watcher. But the subject is one of primary <br />importance to me and I cannot remain silent now after reading the <br />last four or five messages.</p>
<p>The subject of corruption has been discussed at various forums, by <br />various persons, persons of eminence as well as the common man, <br />through letters to the editor in various magazines and newspapers, <br />but one do not find the end in sight.</p>
<p>Right from a younger age, I refused to accept corruption as a way of <br />life. I built a house, reasonably large myself, without ever paying <br />anyone a paisa towards bribe. I was only a very ordinary individual <br />but I had made up my mind that I won't bribe anyone. Same way I <br />never accepted any bribe at any time despite being in a Service <br />industry with lot of opportunities. Not paying a bribe resulted in <br />more delays and denials, but I always succeeded ultimately.  <br />Most people either do not want to suffer the delay or harassment, or <br />do not mind, because they too accept some gratification sometime in <br />their life or other</p>
<p>If only, one decides to personally fight it at all levels, and first <br />makes up his mind on the subject, the problem becomes simple and one <br />can win over and change the entire populace. First it has to begin <br />with oneself. For this one has to be honest to oneself - apart from <br />being honest to others. A very difficult proposition, but not an <br />impossible one. I suffered all my younger life because of this, but <br />the rewards (from above - for those who believe in HIM) were <br />greater. Luckily I have chosen and live in a country where <br />corruption is at very negligible minimum levels and thus escape <br />further corruption, but I visit India very often, but absoutely <br />refuse to submit to corruption, I do not mind the delays or <br />detentions and I do love India. I shall only be an Indian despite <br />other choice and try to do my <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  whenever possible to improve the <br />situation in my motherland.</acronym></p>
<p>Love and best wishes to all of you, most of you are very young and <br />can easily change the society, if only you are determined about it.</p>

        <p>Rahul, Anusha,</p>
<p>The dialogue in the movie Indian depcits our country's state - "matha <br />natukaran kadamaya meerarathukku than lancham vanguvan, namma nattula <br />kadamaya seyarathukke lancham"..</p>
<p>Worst thing, in yesterday's Visuvin arattai arangam, a handicapped girl <br />said, when she went to the govt hospital to get a certificate that she <br />is handicapped, to get a scholarship of aroun Rs.450, the doctor asked <br />for a bribe of Rs.200. What to do with such animals in our country?</p>
<p>Good that you have such high regard for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ,b ut the fact is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  pattan <br />kalathilayum corruption was prevailing. Corruption is omnipresent in <br />Kaliyugam. Chanakya in his arthashastra talks about the punishments to <br />be given to tax evaders, corrupts etc.(though i have not read, have <br />heard it). So when punishment is spelt out it means it was prevailing. <br />And it was 2200 years back. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  is just 1000 years back.. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  punished <br />Uttama chola's son because he mishandled temples wealth.</acronym></acronym></p>

        <p>Hi anusha;</p>
<p>What you are saying is absolutely right!! Being a businessman i have<br />experienced this evil first hand. It is as if taking bribes is a birth<br />r<br />it without a hint of shame. They are being paid from the taxes we pay and<br />they still want more. It is not as if they do extra work, they require<br />bribes to do their day to day jobs!!!</p>
<p>I dont this evil would have existed durin <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  times as that was more dictator<br />type rule. Maybe we should have the same now!!!</acronym></p>
<p>Im sorry for deviating from the group topic but this evil has to be thrown<br />out!!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hello friends,<br />  This mail may be a slight deviation from the objective of this<br />  group. But I personally feel that we, as the people talking about<br />  India's history &amp; culture should take a note on this.<br />  You all would be aware of the case of Manjunath Shanmugham, a young<br />  lad killed in Lucknow. His offence being his attitude to keep up his<br />  honesty. While I was watching this news on NDTV i was really shocked to<br />  notice an SMS which read thus "May be this is the right time to teach<br />  our students 'Honesty is not the best policy'." Is that so. Where are<br />  we heading to?<br />  But giving this a thought, yesterday we lost a Satyendra Dubey in<br />  Bihar and today we lose a Manjunath Shanmugham,all for the greedy<br />  hunger of the devil called corruption, and tomorrow.....? Two things<br />  may happen, either brain drain (which happens even now, but will be<br />  worse tomorrow) or people with attitude like 'while in Rome be a<br />  Roman'. So Where will be our culture? What are we going to do?</p>
<p>  Thanks,<br />  Anusha.</p>
