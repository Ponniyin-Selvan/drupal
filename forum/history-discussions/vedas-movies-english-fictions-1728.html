<p>Hello Sri,</p>
<p>Very good inflow from you on the topics. Exchanges by Priya - very <br />interesting ... kind of volleying..</p>
<p>In mid 70s some of us started with James Hadley Chase / Christie - moved to <br />Harold Robbins and then Arthur Haily, Archer, Irwin Wallace and end with <br />Frederick Forsyth ... read Robert Ludlum along with FF. Certain Novels were <br />well timed. R-Document - not supposed to be Original version - during <br />Emergency ! Archers novel during Argentina war! FF's Icon with Gorbechev <br />election. Wallace the Man, the Word, The Prize, the Severn Minutes etc. <br />were wonderful.</p>
<p>In comparison we may find it difficult to match in Tamil works ..</p>
<p>Same is the case with movies .. But still we call Sivaji, MGR , Sridhar ... <br />as Legends because they have accomplished a lot inspite of limitations..</p>
<p>Vedas, Gita are recently much discussed in various platform including <br />political and have really kindled interest among the youth! Today's youth <br />does not want to opine without knowing what is what! Exactly what <br />Thiruvalluvar advised us to do.. </p>
<p>Means today's younger generation is listening to the Elders .. and trying <br />to analise. Another interesting thing I have been noticing is : No one <br />tells lie .. If one can look for Truth he can find from someone's <br />statement .. They are all responsible for their words...</p>
<p>Take the youths of our Group : Some have got into research in History - <br />publishing papers - writing varallaru.com - planning documentaries - audio <br />version of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  commenced - to be continued also.</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  spark has ignited a lot in us. </p>
<p>If the force is channelised, we could paint a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>fondly, sps</p></acronym></p>

        <p>Hi Dr,</p>
<blockquote><p> the question is not who created the divide but the divide is there a very<br />valid point...its not the brahmins who kill people or humiliate</p></blockquote>
<p>people....but if the other caste</p>
<blockquote><p> hindus will not even let the people of lesser castes enter their streets<br />how on earth are they going to the temples or gurukuls etc.....</p></blockquote>
<p>How true doctor!!!. If you go through todays 'The Hindu' Newspaper, you can<br />find an article.1500 Hindus embraced Buddhism in the southern parts of<br />perambalur under the head of Nagpur monks.50 people tonsured there heads on<br />the spot.I have to quote what the embraced pepole said, "We have only this<br />option to get away from the caste driven Hinduism'.You can understand from<br />this statement how badly this Dalits were treated by the so called higher<br />caste people.</p>
<p>If Hinduism is going to be 'caste driven', then after some years only the<br />'Iyers' and 'Iyengars' or the so called higher caste people which are in a<br />very small number will remain in the Hinduism.</p>
<p>Think about that......</p>
<p>Anyhow have a nice weekend.</p>
<p>Anbudan<br />Venish</p>

        <p>Dear Vijay</p>
<p>I hear this in our group SunTV is a culprit I cant be judgemental as I dont See Raj of JJ</p>
<p>I understand the comperes are attocious in their Tamilkolai especially coming from the stables of Kalaingar family...</p>
<p>But I think thats just a reflection of the status of tamilpattru in Tamilnadu..I see the girls killing tamil more than the men....Kushbu doesnt speak chaste tamil in JJTV does She????</p>
<p>As for rating the rating are always popular rating Dhool definitely did a better business that Anbe Sivam....thats all what it is about...Ayitha Ezhuthu didnt stay long at the top Ghilli did...</p>
<p>In a way I appreciate the director of Ghilli to use Kabadi as his focus point..It could have been boxing,cricket anything...</p>
<p>Read Evening News by Arthur Hailey...It tells you all bout the intricasies of a Television Studio</p>
<p>So lets not blame TV they only provide what we want...How many of you switched from DD to Sun when it was launched because all DD was giving was 4 hours of entertainment every week Fridays OO and Sunday movie....</p>
<p>Its always easy to blame others but we have to change first.<br />How many of you posses a copy of AyithaEzhuthu.....Honest answer...please I do....Does AR Rehman not Kill Tamil verses by getting Adnan Sahni sing Nenjamellam....Have we done anything???Is there paucity of Tamil singers....</p>
<p>Listen to O yuva yuva guys If you can read between ARRs music.....The lyrics is good...Ay one stage Vairamuthu and ARR almost fellout beacuse he felt his words were lost.</p>
<p>Same thing for Vidyasagar....Arjunar Villu took me five times to understand the lyrics....</p>
<p>I dont know if they are on amission impossible of getting others to kill tamil words.</p>
<p>But how many of us have boycotted ARR,Harris Jeyaraj or Vidyasagar???We all listen to it...Yes I winge and whine but I listen to them</p>
<p>So unless We change The Changes wont Happen</p>

        <p>Dear Venish</p>
<p>Critics will shape an artist to develop better, because of the critics Kalki wrote an chapter explaning what happened in future to the characters in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .</p>
<p>I beg to disagree Kalki wrote the last Chapter for the masses.He wrote that for his vasagargal and neyargal....thats what makes it great...read the mudivarai yourself.....</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tamil.net/projectmadurai/pub/pm0169/ponni5d.pdf" title="http://www.tamil.net/projectmadurai/pub/pm0169/ponni5d.pdf">http://www.tamil.net/projectmadurai/pub/pm0169/ponni5d.pdf</a><br />read the mudivurai you dont need any fonts...</p>
<p>if you read this there has been no mention about critics.only about his fans....Sorry </p>
<p>The masses are as important as critics thats my point You cannot argue is the mother more important or is the father more important..Both are needed thats exactly how it is between masses and critical acclaim....</p>
<p>Thats what I have been trying to tell all this while but Unfortunately it has been misconstrued that I have been saying Masses are important.</p>
<p>We need both</p>
<p>I rest my case</p>

<p>Something like what Kamalhaasan does so often. Vasool Raja,<br />PanchaThanthram, PKS for the masses and Mahanadhi, Anbe Sivam kinda<br />movie for the critics and classes. </p>
<p>But I believe the media should also have a hand in promoting high<br />quality literary creations. Every body is so money and market minded<br />that good works are not acknowledged. Classic Eg, was the film, mOka<br />muL. Actually I didn't understand the movie, when I first saw it. I was<br />in my school final though. But when I saw it for the second time, after<br />4-5 years, I realised, what a good movie it was. Although I never read<br />the original script of Janakiraman. But even a standard magazine like<br />Vikatan, didn't even write a review for that. Today's TV channels are<br />also so mass oriented that they don't praise good works. The Sun TV is a<br />real criminal. I still remember, they rated Dhool ahead of Anbe Sivam.<br />What a pity !!!!</p>

        <p>Dear Doctor,</p>
<blockquote><p> I totally disagree with the statement that Mass are not needed and you only<br />need critis to keep a work going....</p></blockquote>
<p>You should understand one fact, Iam not at all saying that mass are not<br />needed.They are<br />definitely a part of the success of any art but only to a lesser propotion.</p>
<p>I can tell you one point, The art which has very mass support can fail but<br />an art which went through critics seldom fails.As I said in the previous<br />mail, the songs 'O..Podu' and similar songs had a very strong mass appeal,<br />but would you say them as immortal!! now itself its very rare to hear that<br />songs.</p>
<p>To make an art immortal, 75% Critics and 25% mass appeal is<br />needed.Definitely it is difficult (I dosen't mean it impossible) to make an<br />art immortal without masses,but its not like, doctor you are saying that<br />mass is the primary reason.</p>
<p>As already said by priya, Mass gives temporary fame to art and critics only<br />give immortality.</p>
<blockquote><p> Unnal Mudiyum thambi Udayamoorthi is a good example..</p></blockquote>
<p>I can prove my point by the movie "Unnal Mudiyum thambi" itself.Take "Unnal<br />Mudiyum thambi" and "Gilli" both had mass appeal. "Unnal Mudiyum thambi"<br />survived crtics while "Gilli" ????.Even after so much years we are talking<br />about "Unnal Mudiyum thambi" but we wont remember "Gilli" next month.</p>
<p>Critics will shape an artist to develop better, because of the critics Kalki<br />wrote an chapter explaning what happened in future to the characters in<br />PS.But mass takes us to an imaginary world thinking we are the heroes.</p>
<p>Take 'Harry Potter' Compare the First book and fifth book you can clearly<br />see the diffrence between the writings.The first one was very good.</p>
<blockquote><p> the movies like '12B',<br /> 12B was a poor Remake of Sliding Doors....You should see it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I alerady said I quoted the movies '12B' and 'kakka Kakka' for the way of<br />telling stories and not about the stories.</p>
<p>I don't remember exactly, but someone said through this discussion that<br />kalki wrote small short stories for his daily needs, also he wrote<br />'<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ','<acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym ','KP' etc..</p>
<p>That's what we need today.Let our writers write songs like 'Yeappadi<br />Yeappadi Samanjatu Yeapaddi' but parallely create some masterpieces.That<br />will make Tamil to greater heights or atleast will make it survive. We<br />should not make Tamil as what is now Sanskrit, talking of past prides -<br />'Once upon a time Sanskrit was very good.'</p>
<p>I can say you something doctor,</p>
<p>'Winning is important but it's not everything'</p>
<p>Win the masses by creating what they expect like 'Gilli' or present tamil<br />novels, but create some masterpieces for our future generation....</p>

        <p>Dear Venish</p>
<p>While speaking about novels, junk?? YES!! I haven't read a good novel after Kalki's writings.The 'Kalikattu Idikasam' of vairamuthu was Not Bad but it can't compete elsewhere.</p>
<p>A fantastic example Venish Do you think Kalki would be immortal if he hadnt reached the masses??It was a great story but if they had just impressed the amsses we wouldnt be having a discussion forum 50 years on.....I have known the exitemnt people have had when <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  was first released in Kalki...</p>
<p>I have seen the same exitement when it was released again and again....</p>
<p>The same with YavanaRani and Kadalpura at one time it was those recirculations which kept kumudam going.</p>
<p>Ratham ore Niram is another great piece of work...Vengaiyin mainthan..the list is so on and so forth all these authors are discussed because they reached the masses....</p>
<p>I totally disagree with the statement that Mass are not needed and you only need critis to keep a work going....</p>
<p>To quote Priya all those vedas were not written and were transmitted by vaimozhi...but they did survive thousands of years why because they reached the masses and convinced them they needed to be preserved and passed on to further generations In this case the mass was the rishis and munis and the leraned people I am not using anyy caste related names on purpose here.</p>
<p>Do you think we ll be hearing ponnar sangar kathai and maruthu pandiyar kathai in the villages if they didnot reach the masses.</p>
<p>Sorry my freind....Unnal Mudiyum thambi Udayamoorthi is a good example..you can sing all the keerthanas in a AC hall but you should also sing something which reaches the masses Same as Sindu says to JKB ib sindubairavi...</p>
<p>Everyone remembers MS Viswanathan....TM saoundararajan...P suseela but other that the intelectuals who remmembers or know Seshagopalan,Balamurali Krishna.....they were well aclaimed and achieved artists....But it KJ Yesudoss catchery which is full houses because the masses can identify and amalgamate with his music...</p>
<p>I am just taking the extreme stance here as the Devils advocate here But THe masses are needed for anything.</p>
<p>How did dickens achieve his greatness because he reached people with his tale of two cities which was about the French Revolution and Life Before</p>
<p>The List is endless Dont Dismiss the people.... </p>
<p>the movies like '12B',<br />12B was a poor Remake of Sliding Doors....You should see it.The main difference between the two is though in 12B he creats a second heroine and makes her a widow and kills sham...(Just continueing the foolish sentiment of once a widow always a widow)I dont think 12B was a great movie <br />Youll understand that if you see 12B...<br />The heroine)Gwyneth Paltrow)...gets fired ,meets an attaractive man in the lift(John Hannah),and on the wayback home crosses the sliding doors of the tube..<br />The story splits there...One makes it and one doesnt..the one who makes it reaches home to see her boyfreind in bed with another woman ..leaves him stats her own business suceeds meets hannah again falls in love becomes pregnant misunderstands he is involved with some one else(actually his seperated wife they just act as a happy couple to kleep his dying mother happy)in an accident has an abortion...<br />understands everything and walks out of the hospital with hannah in the lift and they come out of the lift happily(another sliding door)<br />The one who misses the train gets mugged goes to hospital and gets home but by then her boyfreinds deeds are all over..she toils for him while he sees the other woman without her knowledge...Becames pregnant and finds hes cheating on her..meets hannah I think hes sympathetic but she declines his advances..again an bortion in an accident...She walks out on him ...She meets hannah again in the lift This time she smiles at him They Leave the lift hand in hand(another sliding door.)<br />Its the same charectors just behaving differetly but the end of destiny is the same thats the novelty which was not there in 12B</p>
<p>'Kakka Kakka' Even if they had heroism they are at<br />acceptable level and the story telling was very good.Even Hollywood produces<br />more junk movies.<br />Absolutely We only get the good ones in India</p>
<p>A wonderful story All I would like to say is if we are still monkeys saying oh i dont know I m just doing what others are doing is OK but if you are a human being you should start questioning why you rae doing and change practice...My greatgrandfather did it so I am doing is not right...</p>
<p>The people who asked the question became great thinkers and social reformers a Gandhi ..a Barathi..a VOC...a Ambedkar... a muthuramalingam..a kamaraj....</p>
<p>The rest are alas just Lesser Mortals they are no different to the monkeys in your story.</p>
<p>Kamalhassan educated his kids at home because none of the schools admitted his kids without Caste in the form which he declined(I dont know how true this is)</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>A very nice and a healthy discussion is going on.I would also share some<br />points with<br />you as per my knowledge.Iam not very good at literature anyhow according to<br />my knowledge, as Priya<br />rightly pointed out there is nor great novelist or poets now in Tamil.After<br />the uprise of cinema,<br />the entire nature of writing poems was spoiled and now if you try to hear<br />the lyrics of the cinema songs 90% of the songs are very vulgar I cannot<br />call the songs as soft porn or something else.You can argue that People<br />likes it, yes pepole likes it but only for a short time say 'O..Podu' or<br />'manamtha rasa' only short lived we can hear them for a month or two after<br />that ????.So as priya said immortality is not given by the mass.</p>
<p>While speaking about novels, junk?? YES!! I haven't read a good novel after<br />Kalki's writings.The 'Kalikattu Idikasam' of vairamuthu was Not Bad but it<br />can't compete elsewhere.</p>
<p>Movies, I disagree with you in some points.You cant say there are no good<br />movies coming.There are some movies which are very good and commercially hit<br />to some extent.Take the movie 'Kudaikul Malai'.See the screenplay of the<br />movie, I can say it's up to the hollywood standards, also you should note<br />the movies like '12B','Kakka Kakka' Even if they had heroism they are at<br />acceptable level and the story telling was very good.Even Hollywood produces<br />more junk movies.</p>
<p>For the caste system I would like to point out the following very famous<br />story, whcih will be very suitable...</p>
<p>"Put eight monkeys in a room. In the middle of the room is a ladder, leading<br />to a bunch of bananas hanging from a hook on the ceiling. Each time a monkey<br />tries to climb the ladder, all the other monkeys are sprayed with ice water,<br />which makes them miserable.<br />Soon enough, whenever a monkey attempts to climb the ladder, all of the<br />other monkeys, not wanting to be sprayed, set upon him and beat him up.<br />Soon, none of the eight monkeys ever attempts to climb the ladder. One of<br />the original monkeys is then removed, and a new monkey is put in the room.<br />Seeing the bananas and the ladder, he wonders why none of the other monkeys<br />are doing the obvious, but, undaunted, he immediately begins to climb the<br />ladder. All the other monkeys fall upon him and beat him silly. He has no<br />idea why. However, he no longer attempts to climb the ladder.<br />A second original monkey is removed and replaced. The newcomer again<br />attempts to climb the ladder, but all the other monkeys hammer the crap out<br />of him. This includes the previous new monkey, who, grateful that he's not<br />on the receiving end this time, participates in the beating because all the<br />other monkeys are doing it. However, he has no idea why he's attacking the<br />new monkey.<br />One by one, all the original monkeys are replaced. Eight new monkeys are now<br />in the room. None of them have ever been sprayed by ice water. None of them<br />attempt to climb the ladder. All of them will enthusiastically beat up any<br />new monkey who tries, without having any idea why."</p>
<p>That's exactly what is happening now.In early days, people were separated by<br />the profession thay are doing 'Chatriyan','Navidan' etc.. not by birth -<br />This concept will be clearly stated in 'Bhavat Gita' only after then the<br />classification by birth came and its continuing tinn now and none of them<br />know why are we 'Brahmin' or 'Chettiar' or something except the reason that<br />his/her parents are Brahmin or Chettiar.</p>
<p>Overall I think priya is right in her points....</p>
<p>Anbudan<br />Venish</p>

          vedas, movies &amp; English Fictions        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Satish<br />Thank you a few clarifications....</p>
<p>We discuss mainly <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and Tamil heritage related topics...But do not stop people from introducing related topics and discussions....</p>
<p>This whole literary debate etc was an off shoot of IS Tamil Really Dying???</p>
<p>Second..As a elite group we are not religion based or caste based and the discussions are healthy and we make sure...this whole discussion into current status of our society ,untouchability etc started off as an offshoot of priya's suggestion of giving a complementary 500 to the pujaris and iyers......My suggestion was to encourage unemployed educated youth in different societies....</p>
<p>I think we all will agree as long as there is a north south divide...tamil kannada dide...hindu muslim divide....giving beneficial bonus to one sect will not go down with the masses....</p>
<p>the question is not who created the divide but the divide is there a very valid point...its not the brahmins who kill people or humiliate people....but if the other caste hindus will not even let the people of lesser castes enter their streets how on earth are they going to the temples or gurukuls etc.....</p>
<p>have you seen vedam pudithu....thats exactly what happens when the village elders son wants to learn the vedas theres so much resistance from the rest but charuhasan's charector teaches him...</p>
<p>Aythavan irukka ambai nondu enna payan.....unfortunately thats what is happenening today</p>
<p>BTW...the tamil teacher of mine who spent 2 mnths to tell us silambu was a brahmin...and most of my freinds are....</p>
<p>It was just a discussion</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Sri </p>
<p>Hi Priya, Dr.Sridhar,</p>
<p>Good discussion going on.....a healthy debate..but its a pity that <br />out of 470 members only two are three are discussion. Fine everyone <br />has their own commitments and we should not comment on that. <br />Initially I was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  taken aback, because when i joined this group, <br />I thought this group discusses about the history and chola dynasty. <br />But I find that everything from movies to caste system is discussed. <br />Later I thought, ok anything which is within limits and healthy makes <br />a good debate. Let me pour in some of my thoughts too.</acronym></p>
<p>I am not good in literature and have not read many a books and so I <br />cannot comment on the literary works as you people do, but I strogly <br />belive that the current day so called literarians lack quality. As <br />Priya rightly said, we cant find a great poet after Barathiyar. And <br />my frank opinion is, having named our group after <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , it would be <br />great to debate and know about our own great writers and scholers <br />instead of talking about westerners and their culture.Fine let me <br />leave the topic of literature here, as I am not the right person to <br />disucuss about that.</acronym></p>
<p>Its good that everyone here accepts the fact that, the caste system <br />in hinduism is based on the work people were doing and not by birth. <br />No were in the Hindu scripture, as rightly pointed out by Priya, <br />people were discriminated by caste. Everyone were doing thier duty <br />and were living in Harmony. Ofcourse there were stray incidents of a <br />higher caste discriminating a lower caste etc.Untouchability, not <br />allowing the lower caste into temples are man made and was purely <br />done to show ones superiority over other, which is not at all human <br />nature. Some things in our society are done without reasoing. For <br />example, all of us when we goto vinayaka temple, slowly hit our head <br />with both the knuckles and cross our leg and do thopukaranam. How <br />many know why its being done. 90% people do it blindly thinking that <br />it has to be done before pillayar and nothing else.Similarly, long <br />long ago some chavanist upper caste person would have started the <br />untouchability or not allowing lower caste into temple etc. which was <br />followed by the later people without questioning. But here all the <br />upper caste cannot be blamed because most of them are doing it <br />without knowing what it means. If some exceptional person questions, <br />he becomes an outcast in their community, and due to this fear no one <br />opens their mouth. afterall man is a social being. Best example is <br />Bharatiyar who was treated as an out cast by the fellow brahmins of <br />that age. Whatever be the case, these blind practices has to be <br />undone.</p>
<p>Man's general mentality is to remember the bad things for life time <br />and forget the good things then and there. Thats why we are still <br />talking about the caste system even in todays world. As Priya quoted <br />there are lots of history and instances where the upper caste have <br />treated the lower caste equal. Sankara prostrated before a pulaya, <br />Ramanujachari converted hundreds and thousands of lower caste people <br />into brahmins by wearing upanayanam to them, out of 63 nayanmars only <br />a few are brahmins, the list goes on. Even in Ramayanam, lord rama <br />accepts a lower caste Guha as his brother, a vanara Hanuman as his <br />brother. In many instances he embraces Hanuman out of love. No indian <br />scripture preached untouchability. Most of the misconceptions are <br />spread only due to political gains. Why no one talks about <br />Bharatiyars good deeds towards the lower caste. He too wore poonal to <br />the harijans and took them to the agraharam, he faced the wrath of <br />his family members and his community. Bhimrao Ambedkar belongs to a <br />lower caste community. But 'Ambedkar' is the name of his brahmin <br />teacher which Bhimrao accepted as part of his name. If one were to <br />accept others name as their name, how much the other person would <br />have influenced his/her life. Why is that brahmin teacher not talked <br />about while talking about ambedkar? The great tamil language which we <br />hail, was rejunevated by swamitha iyer, whom we call tamil thatha, <br />without him we would have lost many of the rare tamil literature. <br />Dr.Abdul Kalam, in his autobiography,"wings of fire", in the very <br />first chapter thanks many of his teachers who influenced him. More <br />than half of those teachers were brahmins. Why dont the society see <br />the service rendered by the brahmins to the society. </p>
<p>I am not sure who wrote this, I think its Dr.Sridhar, that everyday <br />in the newspaper we can read that a lower caste was killed by the <br />upper caste. But if you see, not even a single incident will be <br />involving a brahimin. Its generally said that a upper caste killed a <br />lower caste. Brahmins are not the only upper caste. But it has become <br />practice to associate brahmins with upper caste and upper caste means <br />only brahmins. You may ask me why I am taking it in the wronge sense. <br />Becuase I found a anti-brahmin flavour in all the mails in this <br />debate. I thougth I should correct some misconcptions, if any. Being <br />educated we should see both sides of the coin and thats why I stress <br />that upper caste do not consists of only brahmins. As I said, human <br />nature is to forget the good and remember only the bad. Likewise, the <br />society remembers only the bad things done by a very few upper caste, <br />but forget to see the lot many good things done by the majority of <br />the upper caste. va.u.chidambaram pillai lost all of his property for <br />the sake of the country. </p>
<p>If this is the case in tamil nadu, at the national level its still <br />worse. Tailians are discriminated to the core and if its a brahmin, <br />thats the end of it. Again kappalotiya tamilan is a best example. His <br />name is not in the limelight of the indian freedom struggle. <br />kattabomman who thought about freedom two hunder years before Gandhi <br />or Nehru is not known nation wide. Bhagat singh and Veera vanchi did <br />the same thing, but Bhagat singh is a national hero, where as veera <br />vanchi isnot known outside tamilnadu, becuase, first he is a <br />tamilian, second he is a brahmin. I am not here to advocate for the <br />upper caste people, but like to stress that, if educated people like <br />us are not seeing both sides of the coin, how can we expect the <br />society to do so. As long as there is bitterness, inequality can <br />never be eradicated. </p>
<p>I wish to write more, but already its quite lengthy and i think I <br />have bored all of you a lot. Will be backat a later time, if time <br />permits. Sorry if I have said something wrong here.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Priya, Dr.Sridhar,</p>
<p>Good discussion going on.....a healthy debate..but its a pity that <br />out of 470 members only two are three are discussion. Fine everyone <br />has their own commitments and we should not comment on that. <br />Initially I was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  taken aback, because when i joined this group, <br />I thought this group discusses about the history and chola dynasty. <br />But I find that everything from movies to caste system is discussed. <br />Later I thought, ok anything which is within limits and healthy makes <br />a good debate. Let me pour in some of my thoughts too.</acronym></p>
<p>I am not good in literature and have not read many a books and so I <br />cannot comment on the literary works as you people do, but I strogly <br />belive that the current day so called literarians lack quality. As <br />Priya rightly said, we cant find a great poet after Barathiyar. And <br />my frank opinion is, having named our group after <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , it would be <br />great to debate and know about our own great writers and scholers <br />instead of talking about westerners and their culture.Fine let me <br />leave the topic of literature here, as I am not the right person to <br />disucuss about that.</acronym></p>
<p>Its good that everyone here accepts the fact that, the caste system <br />in hinduism is based on the work people were doing and not by birth. <br />No were in the Hindu scripture, as rightly pointed out by Priya, <br />people were discriminated by caste. Everyone were doing thier duty <br />and were living in Harmony. Ofcourse there were stray incidents of a <br />higher caste discriminating a lower caste etc.Untouchability, not <br />allowing the lower caste into temples are man made and was purely <br />done to show ones superiority over other, which is not at all human <br />nature. Some things in our society are done without reasoing. For <br />example, all of us when we goto vinayaka temple, slowly hit our head <br />with both the knuckles and cross our leg and do thopukaranam. How <br />many know why its being done. 90% people do it blindly thinking that <br />it has to be done before pillayar and nothing else.Similarly, long <br />long ago some chavanist upper caste person would have started the <br />untouchability or not allowing lower caste into temple etc. which was <br />followed by the later people without questioning. But here all the <br />upper caste cannot be blamed because most of them are doing it <br />without knowing what it means. If some exceptional person questions, <br />he becomes an outcast in their community, and due to this fear no one <br />opens their mouth. afterall man is a social being. Best example is <br />Bharatiyar who was treated as an out cast by the fellow brahmins of <br />that age. Whatever be the case, these blind practices has to be <br />undone.</p>
<p>Man's general mentality is to remember the bad things for life time <br />and forget the good things then and there. Thats why we are still <br />talking about the caste system even in todays world. As Priya quoted <br />there are lots of history and instances where the upper caste have <br />treated the lower caste equal. Sankara prostrated before a pulaya, <br />Ramanujachari converted hundreds and thousands of lower caste people <br />into brahmins by wearing upanayanam to them, out of 63 nayanmars only <br />a few are brahmins, the list goes on. Even in Ramayanam, lord rama <br />accepts a lower caste Guha as his brother, a vanara Hanuman as his <br />brother. In many instances he embraces Hanuman out of love. No indian <br />scripture preached untouchability. Most of the misconceptions are <br />spread only due to political gains. Why no one talks about <br />Bharatiyars good deeds towards the lower caste. He too wore poonal to <br />the harijans and took them to the agraharam, he faced the wrath of <br />his family members and his community. Bhimrao Ambedkar belongs to a <br />lower caste community. But 'Ambedkar' is the name of his brahmin <br />teacher which Bhimrao accepted as part of his name. If one were to <br />accept others name as their name, how much the other person would <br />have influenced his/her life. Why is that brahmin teacher not talked <br />about while talking about ambedkar? The great tamil language which we <br />hail, was rejunevated by swamitha iyer, whom we call tamil thatha, <br />without him we would have lost many of the rare tamil literature. <br />Dr.Abdul Kalam, in his autobiography,"wings of fire", in the very <br />first chapter thanks many of his teachers who influenced him. More <br />than half of those teachers were brahmins. Why dont the society see <br />the service rendered by the brahmins to the society. </p>
<p>I am not sure who wrote this, I think its Dr.Sridhar, that everyday <br />in the newspaper we can read that a lower caste was killed by the <br />upper caste. But if you see, not even a single incident will be <br />involving a brahimin. Its generally said that a upper caste killed a <br />lower caste. Brahmins are not the only upper caste. But it has become <br />practice to associate brahmins with upper caste and upper caste means <br />only brahmins. You may ask me why I am taking it in the wronge sense. <br />Becuase I found a anti-brahmin flavour in all the mails in this <br />debate. I thougth I should correct some misconcptions, if any. Being <br />educated we should see both sides of the coin and thats why I stress <br />that upper caste do not consists of only brahmins. As I said, human <br />nature is to forget the good and remember only the bad. Likewise, the <br />society remembers only the bad things done by a very few upper caste, <br />but forget to see the lot many good things done by the majority of <br />the upper caste. va.u.chidambaram pillai lost all of his property for <br />the sake of the country. </p>
<p>If this is the case in tamil nadu, at the national level its still <br />worse. Tailians are discriminated to the core and if its a brahmin, <br />thats the end of it. Again kappalotiya tamilan is a best example. His <br />name is not in the limelight of the indian freedom struggle. <br />kattabomman who thought about freedom two hunder years before Gandhi <br />or Nehru is not known nation wide. Bhagat singh and Veera vanchi did <br />the same thing, but Bhagat singh is a national hero, where as veera <br />vanchi isnot known outside tamilnadu, becuase, first he is a <br />tamilian, second he is a brahmin. I am not here to advocate for the <br />upper caste people, but like to stress that, if educated people like <br />us are not seeing both sides of the coin, how can we expect the <br />society to do so. As long as there is bitterness, inequality can <br />never be eradicated. </p>
<p>I wish to write more, but already its quite lengthy and i think I <br />have bored all of you a lot. Will be backat a later time, if time <br />permits. Sorry if I have said something wrong here.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>
