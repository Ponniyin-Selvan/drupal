The article explains the technique of documenting the Chola paintings. <br /> <br />What was significant yesterday, that all the four, Thiru Sriraman, the speaker, thiru Thyagarajan, the photographer, Dr Sathyamoorthy, the isnpirationbehind the venture, and, Thiru TS Subramnian who wrote the Frontline article were all present in the programme yesterday.<br /> <br />We record our sincerest thanks to all of them.<br /> <br />Anbudan<br /> <br />Swaminathan</p>
<p>An old article in the Frontline covered the archaeologists and the photographer as well as their techniques quite well.  It would be great if theimage file is available online.<br /> <br />-Mani<br /> <br /> <br />Vol:24 Iss:10 URL: <a href="http://www.flonnet.com/fl2410/stories/20070601000106500.htm" title="http://www.flonnet.com/fl2410/stories/20070601000106500.htm">http://www.flonnet.com/fl2410/stories/20070601000106500.htm</a> </p>

<p>ART</p>
<p>Photographic feat <br />T.S. SUBRAMANIAN </p>
<p>The inaccessible Chola murals at the Big Temple in Thanjavur have been captured in almost life-size photographs and displayed at the temple. </p>
<p>The Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>IN a remarkable feat performed in the face of overwhelming odds, two officers of the Archaeological Survey of India (<acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym ) and a young photographer have photographed in minute detail four huge frescoes found in the Brihadisvara temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. What makes their work all the more creditable is the difficult location of the murals, their enormous size and their reflecting surface, all of which posed big challenges. </p>
<p>PHOTOGRAPHS: T. SATYAMURTHY AND N. THYAGARAJAN/ <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  </p>
<p>The passage around the sanctum sanctorum where the murals were found. </p>
<p>The murals, each 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide (4.5 metres x 3 metres), areabout 1,000 years old. They are located in the narrow and dark passage around the temple's sanctum sanctorum. The great Chola king Raja Raja I built the Brihadisvara temple between AD 1000 and AD 1008 and the paintings were done between AD 1008 and AD 1012. </p>
<p>CAPTURING THE MAGNIFICENCE. A single-frame, out-of-perspective picture of the mural depicting Siva as Nataraja. </p>
<p>If most visitors had hitherto no access to these paintings because of theirlocation, they can now relish the paintings' exact photographic reproductions, which are on display at the newly opened Interpretation Centre on the temple premises. The photographs measure nine feet by six feet. </p>
<p>A montage gives a more accurate reproduction of the mural. </p>
<p>The credit for photographing the murals in exact detail, capturing their texture and colour, goes to the team comprising Dr. T. Satyamurthy, who was Superintending Archaeologist, <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym , Chennai Circle, when the project was executed; P.S. Sriraman, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist; and N. Thyagarajan, artist and photographer. </p>
<p>PHOTOGRAPHS: T. SATYAMURTHY AND N. THYAGARAJAN/ <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  </p>
<p>Rishi and Rishikumara in the Dakshinamurthy panel. </p>
<p>The four paintings depict Siva as Dakshinamurthy, the story of Tamil Saivite saint Sundarar, Siva as Tripurantaka, and Raja Raja Chola and his family worshipping Nataraja (Siva) at the Chidambaram temple. The paintings, rich in detail, offer a lot of historical information. While all the frescoes inthe Brihadisvara temple together occupy 660 square metres, these four paintings alone take up 110 sq m. </p>

<p>Photographing the murals was extremely difficult because they are painted on both walls of the dark, dingy and narrow passage, which has no ventilation. The space between the two walls is less than seven feet, so there is notmuch space for the photographer to step back and capture images. Since thepaintings are 15 feet tall, one must crane one's neck to look at the top portions. Most visitors are not allowed to see these paintings because of the narrowness of the passage and the poor light and ventilation. </p>
<p>Royal ladies in the Nataraja panel. </p>
<p>Satyamurthy said: "The <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym , Chennai Circle, therefore, undertook a project to photograph the murals, prepare photographic reproductions and display them in almost their true size and original colours. This effort required special techniques because of paucity of space, poor lighting and the enormoussize of the murals. They had to be photographed in many small frames and then joined to make one frame. This effort needed high skill." </p>

<p>Sriraman said: "What is seen in the paintings is seen in the frames. We have assembled the photographs without loss of perspective. Anybody can see the paintings in their original dimensions in our photographs." He explained why the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  decided to go public with the paintings: "Documentation is important because people of the next generation should know that these paintings existed. Recopying is important. In photography, you get accurate reproduction." </p>
<p>A demon and his consort in the Tripurantaka panel. </p>
<p>What prompted Satyamurthy and Sriraman to get the murals photographed was that while a number of books had been written about the Ajanta and Ellora paintings and research done on them, there was virtually no publication on the Chola paintings in the Brihadisvara temple. </p>
<p>It was in 1931 that these four, and other, murals in the temple were discovered by S.K. Govindaswami of Tamil Nadu. He wrote to The Hindu about it. The relevant news item in The Hindu of April 11, 1931, reads: </p>
<p>"Thousand years old Chola frescoes <br />Reported discovery in Tanjore Big Temple <br />Mr. S.K. Govindaswami, M.A., Annamalai University, writes to us under date 10th instant: - </p>
<p>SIVA AS TRIPURANTAKA, who subdued the three demons. </p>
<p>Close upon the discovery of the Pallava paintings in the Kailasanathaswami Temple at Conjeevaram by the French savant, the indefatigable Prof. JouveauDubreuil, it has been my great good fortune to bring to light the hithertounknown frescoes of the Imperial Chola period, in the Brihadeswaraswami Temple, popularly known as `The Big Temple of Tanjore'." </p>
<p>When Govindaswami visited the temple in 1930, he found "in the dim religious light of a small oil lamp... the existence of some kind of paintings on the walls on either side of a dark, narrow circumambulatory passage around the sanctum sanctorum". <br />When he returned to the temple in 1931 and examined the place thoroughly with the help of a "Baby Petromax", he found that the bright light indeed revealed paintings. "But paintings of an undoubtedly very late and degenerate age, whose linear contortions and chromatic extravagances shattered in a moment all my wonderful dreams of discovering there the best and the only example of the art of Chola mural paintings. Still I chose a part of the western wall for close inspection and found the painted plastering there crackedall over and threatening to fall down. A gentle touch and the whole mass crumbled down, exposing underneath a fine series of frescoes palpitating with the life of the other days." </p>
<p>THE INTERPRETATION CENTRE at the temple complex, where the photographs are on show. </p>
<p>Govindaswami went on to describe the paintings in his letter to The Hindu, adding: "The discovery of these paintings is of great importance to the history of South Indian art. Hitherto, the Pallavas held exclusively the palm for mural paintings in the Tamil country. The Cholas may now be believed todivide the honours equally with the Pallavas not only in the South Indian architecture and sculpture but also in South Indian painting. For I have little doubt, judging from the excellence of the drawings, the colour scheme and the fresco-technique, that these paintings belong to the best period ofChola rule, to the glorious reign of Raja Raja the Great, and contemporarywith the building of the Great Temple at Tanjore." <br />The paintings with "linear contortions and chromatic extravagances" of the "very late and degenerate age", which covered the Chola murals before Govindaswami discovered the latter, were those of the Nayakas and were done in the 16th and 17th centuries. <br />In terms of the area they occupy, the Chola paintings in the Brihadisvara temple rank next only to the Buddhist paintings at Ajanta in Maharashtra. While the murals at Ajanta come under the tempera variety, those at the Big Temple are called frescoes. The artists at Ajanta applied a coat of plaster on the wall of the caves and did the paintings after the plaster dried up. The paintings survive to this day because the painting material holds together the pigment in it and the plaster. <br />But the Chola-age artists used a more difficult technique at the Brihadisvara temple. They applied lime plaster on the wall and painted the murals on the plaster while it was still wet. This demanded that they should do the sketches and complete the painting before the lime plaster dried up. This isnot easy given the humidity conditions in Tamil Nadu. In this technique, the paintings formed part and parcel of the thin lime plaster. Sriraman said, "Here both the plaster and the painting integrate together. The frescoes are, therefore, more durable but their execution is very difficult." <br />In the 1960s, Subbaraman, the Superintending Chemist of the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym , discovereda technique by which he stripped the Nayaka paintings that covered the Chola paintings in such a way that the Nayaka paintings, too, could be saved. Subbaraman removed the Nayaka paintings and pasted them on another mount. <br />When Satyamurthy and Sriraman contacted Thyagarajan about photographing theChola frescoes, he accepted the assignment because of the challenges that the work presented. Thyagarajan, a 31-year-old post-graduate (Master of Fine Arts) from the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai, knew how difficult it was to make a mural because he was an artist himself. The technical difficulties he faced in reproducing the murals in the form of photographs involved their size, their location and their reflecting surfaces. "We solved the problems one by one," he said. <br />Thyagarajan used the technique of montage in photography to deal with the enormous size of the paintings. "The only solution to the problem presented by size lay in photo montaging," he said. He took 40 to 50 frames of each painting, using digital photography, and assembled them in a computer to reproduce the whole painting. </acronym></p>
<p>A ROYAL LADY in theKalyanasundaramurthi panel. It isreminiscent of the Ajanta tradition. </p>
<p>But when he did the montaging, he found that the colours used in the muralsdiffered from area to area. Besides, while the top portions were shadowy, there was light at the lower portions. "I had to balance the photo exposurefrom top to bottom [of the panel]," he said. The offsets created by the protruding pillars on the wall created difficulties because the murals continued on these offsets. Each panel had two offsets. It was not easy to photograph the continuation of the murals on these offsets. <br />The murals were photographed frame by frame. But there were difficulties injoining the frames on computer using digital technology because the framesended with a fine line. He mechanically divided the mural into frames without sacrificing the artistic elegance of the paintings or their aesthetic value. For instance, if the arm of a person in a mural was across two frames, they were joined on computer in such a manner that the difference was notapparent. <br />"If we want to reproduce the aesthetic value of the paintings in the photographs, the montage should be 110 per cent exact. Only an artist who is technically qualified can do that," said Thyagarajan. </p>
<p>Superintending Archaeologist, Chennai Circle, <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym ;P.S. Sriraman, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist, <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym ; and N.Thyagarajan, artist and photographer. </p>
<p>According to Satyamurthy, several pieces of interesting information came tolight when the murals were studied. For instance, in the mural that depicts Siva as Tripurantaka, there is a portrayal of three men worshipping the Buddha. The three men were originally demons (Asuras) who had harassed the Devas. Siva could not destroy these three Asuras because they happened to behis devotees. So the Devas requested Vishnu to convert them to Buddhism. "This is a story of the native Tamil country. This story is found in Tamil Saivite literature. It is not found anywhere else in India. The story is carved not only in stone in the Brihadisvara temple but portrayed in the painting," Satyamurthy said. <br />He is glad that art historians who could not enjoy the Chola paintings in the dark corridor can now study their photographic reproductions in the Interpretation Centre. There are write-ups. Also on exhibition at the centre are the detached Nayaka paintings. </p>
<p>THE location was a nightmare. There was not enough light and space, and useof harsh lights was taboo. How to take photographs of the top portions of the murals? <br />The <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  men rigged up a platform that moved up and down like a lift. "The platform from which the photographs were taken had to move parallel to the panel. The lighting from the top to the bottom had to be uniform," said P.S.Sriraman, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist, <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym . There was a space of only six feet between the paintings and the camera. </p>

The choice reflects the desire of the king to be treatedon par with Sundarar who is the cherished friend of the God. Even otherwise this panel throws out a plethora of information on the contemporary life.We will be looking cl0sely at this panel.<br />The earlier talk on 2-5-09, titled, In appreciation of Chola murals - Commingling of emotions was well attended and appreciated. The substance of the talk was:<br />Calambur Siavaramamurthi, succinctly captures the greatness of the Chola murals. “If expression has to be taken as the criterion, by which a great art has to be judged, it is here in abundance in these Chola paintings..". If Chola art is to be accepted as a great work of art, it needs to be seen by all. How many of us had the privilege to be allowed into the dark circumambulatory passage around the sanctum of the Brihadisvara temple, where the paintings are found? Perhaps very few. Of course, all could not be allowed in there due to paucity of space and delicate condition of the murals. Therefore, <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  launched a documentation project to photograph these murals so that exact photographic reproductions can be kept on view. The task turned out to be a tough one with many challenges to surmount. This presentation will highlight how the task was accomplished and how now we are in a position to realise Sivaramaurthi's words are true.<br />About the speaker:<br />Thiru Sriraman has a post-graduation in Ancient History and Archaeology anda PG Diploma in Archaeology, and is presently an Assistant Superintending Archaeologist with the Archaeological Survey of India. He has rich experience in his field. He has conducted several excavations at Banahalli, a proto-historic site in Karnataka, Gingee, a medieval site and Mahabalipuram, an early historical site. He has explored several regions in Karnataka and Tamilnadu leading to the discoveries of several important archaeological sites. He was instrumental in the reorganization of the sites museum at Lothal, a Harappa Civilization site, the Fort Museum, Fort St George Chennai including the new gallery on Prints.<br />He has conceived, designed and organised the Interpretation Centre at the Brihadisvara temple, Tanjavur and conceived, co-ordinated the Documentation of Chola Murals at Brihadisvara temple at Tanjavur and the Surface featuresat Kailasanatha temple, Kanchipuram.<br />Thiru Sriraman has published a number research papers in reputed journals, has designed and conceived several brochures and handouts for monuments of South India and is currently enganed in writing a book on Chola murals. </acronym></acronym></p>

<p>    As Sriraman rightly pointed out, there have been disagreement on certain issues.</p>
<p>    Disagreements were based on opinions only and not by any alternative support of evidence !!</p>
<p>    On the lighter side, as discussed earlier - we cannot accept LORD KRISHNA if appears in front of us we wont accept if does not resemble in NTR's outfit.</p>
<p>    Likewise, re RRC - Sivaji Ganesan has set some trend.</p>
<p>    In THIRUVISALUR - RRC and his wife Danthisakthi Vitanki had performed HIRANYAGARBAM and THULABARAM. The temple was renovated in late 50s by Nagarathar. They were PRUDENT enough to photograph the stone relief of KING andQUEEN performing Hiranyagarbam !</p>
<p>    It is available in the House opposite row of the Temple Eastern Sannidhi .. Second House - south facing belongs to the Donor - and one can see thephoto !</p>
<p>    RRC is bearded.. little short too.</p>
<p>    We have posted earlier RRC's Bronze as kept in Sarabai Museum, Ahamadabad... he is bearded !</p>
<p>    We have also seen the statues of Kulothunga II .. beareded.</p>
<p>    Certain royal images in Thiruvalanchuzhi Swethavinayagar sanctum - beareded !</p>
<p>    Therefore we can safely assume, an elderly beareded ROYAL personality worshipping NATARAJA in Chidambaram cannot be anyone else than RRC !</p>
<p>    There was another speculation in the paintings : RRC &amp; Karuvurar.</p>
<p>    I have posted earlier that the bearded one is not Karuvurar but RRC, and the one with RAJALAKSHANAM ( Royal looking) should have been Rajendra !</p>
<p>    Recall in 1006 AD - after conquering Chatrachreya, Rajendra made about 9 golden Lotus flowers and offered them to Peruvudayar - " Attithozhudhar "!</p>
<p>    And there was discussion that they were SANAKADHIMUNIVAR..</p>
<p>    We do not dispute :: But we opine that the PAINTERS / SILPIs were GIVENFREEDOM to depict RRC @ Sivapathasekaran and RjC @ Sivasaranasekaran (coutesy : Dr. Kalaikkovan) atleast TWO out of FOUR of the disciples of Lord Siva - in front of Dakshinamurthy !! </p>

<p>      Dear V</p>
<p>      neither is the case. there could be no representation of RR in t'purantaka panel. the image of RR erected outside has no resemblenace to his owndepiction in the paintings. </p>
<p>      RR is depicted at three places in the paintings exposed so far. Once in the Nataraja panel and twice in the Rajaraja worshipping Linga panel. Here the entire family and court of RR is depicted inlcluding RR, RJ and others. In all probability, a great work was being read for the first time. It could be Thevaram. </p>
<p>      I was able to discern this and it was accepted many who could see, like SPS my files with me. The rest, like KK and SG, is yet to accept.</p>
<p>      No one is an ultimate authority in the study of past. Everybody says their view of the past. It may be true. It may be false. But no one can verify it an apparetus. Some looks logically acceptable.</p>

<p>  Disagreements were based on opinions only and not by any alternative support of evidence !!</p>
<p>  On the lighter side, as discussed earlier - we cannot accept LORD KRISHNAif appears in front of us we wont accept if does not resemble in NTR's outfit.</p>
<p>  Likewise, re RRC - Sivaji Ganesan has set some trend.</p>
<p>  In THIRUVISALUR - RRC and his wife Danthisakthi Vitanki had performed HIRANYAGARBAM and THULABARAM. The temple was renovated in late 50s by Nagarathar. They were PRUDENT enough to photograph the stone relief of KING and QUEEN performing Hiranyagarbam !</p>
<p>  It is available in the House opposite row of the Temple Eastern Sannidhi .. Second House - south facing belongs to the Donor - and one can see the photo !</p>
<p>  RRC is bearded.. little short too.</p>
<p>  We have posted earlier RRC's Bronze as kept in Sarabai Museum, Ahamadabad... he is bearded !</p>
<p>  We have also seen the statues of Kulothunga II .. beareded.</p>
<p>  Certain royal images in Thiruvalanchuzhi Swethavinayagar sanctum - beareded !</p>
<p>  Therefore we can safely assume, an elderly beareded ROYAL personality worshipping NATARAJA in Chidambaram cannot be anyone else than RRC !</p>
<p>  There was another speculation in the paintings : RRC &amp; Karuvurar.</p>
<p>  I have posted earlier that the bearded one is not Karuvurar but RRC, and the one with RAJALAKSHANAM ( Royal looking) should have been Rajendra !</p>
<p>  Recall in 1006 AD - after conquering Chatrachreya, Rajendra made about 9 golden Lotus flowers and offered them to Peruvudayar - " Attithozhudhar " !</p>
<p>  And there was discussion that they were SANAKADHIMUNIVAR..</p>
<p>  We do not dispute :: But we opine that the PAINTERS / SILPIs were GIVEN FREEDOM to depict RRC @ Sivapathasekaran and RjC @ Sivasaranasekaran (coutesy : Dr. Kalaikkovan) atleast TWO out of FOUR of the disciples of Lord Siva - in front of Dakshinamurthy !! </p>

        <p>Dear Mr P.S.Sriraman,</p>
<p>Thanking you for your kind advices on same, and also for letting us know more details on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym  etc in these Murals. The close study of these Panels byexperts like you, and the interpretation of what is appearing in these Murals give us a real glimpse of the past and some usefull informations in ourstudy on Cholas, such as your mention that Thevarem being read for the first time being depicted in one of the Panels (Nadaraja or Linga Panel ???).</p>
<p>Could you very kindly let me know where I could find the full interprettionof what you could possibly see in all these Panels at at Thanjai Rajarajeswarem.</p>
<p>Further why not Scholars like you also interpret the Murals found in the second Rajarajeswarem Temple namely the Darasuram Temple the photographs of the Murals which has been stored in the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  File section by another expert in this field for the benefit of those who are involved in the study of Cholas.</p>
<p>As you may already know there had been a News Report some months back in the "Hindu" News Paper, which stated the disappearence of the Pullivanam Temple Murals. However in this same News Report I think if I am not mistaken the Archaeologist M/s Padmawathi describing the Murals that had been there before its disappearence including a Mural on Thiripuranthaha. What I am interested in knowing are you aware whether any Scholar or the Archaelogical Department has photographed and documented same much earlier before their disappearence, and if so could you very kindly advice where I could see them. Your advices in this connection will be appreciated and usefull for many inthe study of Cholas.</p>

<p>  Dear Sivasekaran,</p>
<p>  Thanking you very much for presenting all informations, writings and photographs on the Chola Murals at Thanjavur which are very informative. </p>
<p>  In one of these Murals it is noted, just on the right side of Siva as Thiripuraanthaha in red colour, we see an image in orange colour of an individual in standing position. When this image is enlarged it is clearly visiblethat it is more like that of a royal personality, and it is noted from thehead dress, the anatomical proportion of the body and style of standing ofthis personality in this image resembles the (modern) Rajaraja Chola statue seen out side the Thanjavur Temple complex. Could this be the mural Imageof Rajaraja Chola - 1, or was it from this mural image the modern statue of Rajaraja was shaped ??? Can you or any others well versed in the study ofthese Murals kindly enlighten me on same. </p>

<p>    Photographic feat <br />    T.S. SUBRAMANIAN </p>
<p>    The inaccessible Chola murals at the Big Temple in Thanjavur have been captured in almost life-size photographs and displayed at the temple. </p>
<p>    The Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>    IN a remarkable feat performed in the face of overwhelming odds, two officers of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and a young photographerhave photographed in minute detail four huge frescoes found in the Brihadisvara temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. What makes their work all the more creditable is the difficult location of the murals, their enormous size and their reflecting surface, all of which posed big challenges. </p>
<p>    PHOTOGRAPHS: T. SATYAMURTHY AND N. THYAGARAJAN/ ASI </p>
<p>    The passage around the sanctum sanctorum where the murals were found. </p>
<p>    The murals, each 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide (4.5 metres x 3 metres),are about 1,000 years old. They are located in the narrow and dark passagearound the temple's sanctum sanctorum. The great Chola king Raja Raja I built the Brihadisvara temple between AD 1000 and AD 1008 and the paintings were done between AD 1008 and AD 1012. </p>

<p>    If most visitors had hitherto no access to these paintings because of their location, they can now relish the paintings' exact photographic reproductions, which are on display at the newly opened Interpretation Centre on the temple premises. The photographs measure nine feet by six feet. </p>
<p>    A montage gives a more accurate reproduction of the mural. </p>
<p>    The credit for photographing the murals in exact detail, capturing their texture and colour, goes to the team comprising Dr. T. Satyamurthy, who was Superintending Archaeologist, ASI, Chennai Circle, when the project was executed; P.S. Sriraman, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist; and N. Thyagarajan, artist and photographer. </p>
<p>      PHOTOGRAPHS: T. SATYAMURTHY AND N. THYAGARAJAN/ ASI </p>

<p>    The four paintings depict Siva as Dakshinamurthy, the story of Tamil Saivite saint Sundarar, Siva as Tripurantaka, and Raja Raja Chola and his family worshipping Nataraja (Siva) at the Chidambaram temple. The paintings, rich in detail, offer a lot of historical information. While all the frescoes in the Brihadisvara temple together occupy 660 square metres, these four paintings alone take up 110 sq m. </p>

<p>    Photographing the murals was extremely difficult because they are painted on both walls of the dark, dingy and narrow passage, which has no ventilation. The space between the two walls is less than seven feet, so there isnot much space for the photographer to step back and capture images. Sincethe paintings are 15 feet tall, one must crane one's neck to look at the top portions. Most visitors are not allowed to see these paintings because of the narrowness of the passage and the poor light and ventilation. </p>

<p>    Satyamurthy said: "The ASI, Chennai Circle, therefore, undertook a project to photograph the murals, prepare photographic reproductions and display them in almost their true size and original colours. This effort requiredspecial techniques because of paucity of space, poor lighting and the enormous size of the murals. They had to be photographed in many small frames and then joined to make one frame. This effort needed high skill." </p>

<p>    Sriraman said: "What is seen in the paintings is seen in the frames. Wehave assembled the photographs without loss of perspective. Anybody can see the paintings in their original dimensions in our photographs." He explained why the ASI decided to go public with the paintings: "Documentation is important because people of the next generation should know that these paintings existed. Recopying is important. In photography, you get accurate reproduction." </p>

<p>    What prompted Satyamurthy and Sriraman to get the murals photographed was that while a number of books had been written about the Ajanta and Ellora paintings and research done on them, there was virtually no publication on the Chola paintings in the Brihadisvara temple. </p>
<p>   It was in 1931 that these four, and other, murals in the temple were discovered by S.K. Govindaswami of Tamil Nadu. He wrote to The Hindu about it.The relevant news item in The Hindu of April 11, 1931, reads: </p>
<p>    "Thousand years old Chola frescoes <br />    Reported discovery in Tanjore Big Temple <br />    Mr. S.K. Govindaswami, M.A., Annamalai University, writes to us under date 10th instant: - </p>
<p>    SIVA AS TRIPURANTAKA, who subdued the three demons. </p>
<p>    Close upon the discovery of the Pallava paintings in the Kailasanathaswami Temple at Conjeevaram by the French savant, the indefatigable Prof. Jouveau Dubreuil, it has been my great good fortune to bring to light the hitherto unknown frescoes of the Imperial Chola period, in the Brihadeswaraswami Temple, popularly known as `The Big Temple of Tanjore'." </p>
<p>    When Govindaswami visited the temple in 1930, he found "in the dim religious light of a small oil lamp... the existence of some kind of paintings on the walls on either side of a dark, narrow circumambulatory passage around the sanctum sanctorum". <br />    When he returned to the temple in 1931 and examined the place thoroughly with the help of a "Baby Petromax", he found that the bright light indeedrevealed paintings. "But paintings of an undoubtedly very late and degenerate age, whose linear contortions and chromatic extravagances shattered in a moment all my wonderful dreams of discovering there the best and the onlyexample of the art of Chola mural paintings. Still I chose a part of the western wall for close inspection and found the painted plastering there cracked all over and threatening to fall down. A gentle touch and the whole mass crumbled down, exposing underneath a fine series of frescoes palpitatingwith the life of the other days." </p>
<p>    THE INTERPRETATION CENTRE at the temple complex, where the photographs are on show. </p>
<p>    Govindaswami went on to describe the paintings in his letter to The Hindu, adding: "The discovery of these paintings is of great importance to thehistory of South Indian art. Hitherto, the Pallavas held exclusively the palm for mural paintings in the Tamil country. The Cholas may now be believed to divide the honours equally with the Pallavas not only in the South Indian architecture and sculpture but also in South Indian painting. For I have little doubt, judging from the excellence of the drawings, the colour scheme and the fresco-technique, that these paintings belong to the best period of Chola rule, to the glorious reign of Raja Raja the Great, and contemporary with the building of the Great Temple at Tanjore." <br />    The paintings with "linear contortions and chromatic extravagances" of the "very late and degenerate age", which covered the Chola murals before Govindaswami discovered the latter, were those of the Nayakas and were done in the 16th and 17th centuries. <br />    In terms of the area they occupy, the Chola paintings in the Brihadisvara temple rank next only to the Buddhist paintings at Ajanta in Maharashtra. While the murals at Ajanta come under the tempera variety, those at the Big Temple are called frescoes. The artists at Ajanta applied a coat of plaster on the wall of the caves and did the paintings after the plaster dried up. The paintings survive to this day because the painting material holds together the pigment in it and the plaster. <br />    But the Chola-age artists used a more difficult technique at the Brihadisvara temple. They applied lime plaster on the wall and painted the muralson the plaster while it was still wet. This demanded that they should do the sketches and complete the painting before the lime plaster dried up. This is not easy given the humidity conditions in Tamil Nadu. In this technique, the paintings formed part and parcel of the thin lime plaster. Sriraman said, "Here both the plaster and the painting integrate together. The frescoes are, therefore, more durable but their execution is very difficult." <br />    In the 1960s, Subbaraman, the Superintending Chemist of the ASI, discovered a technique by which he stripped the Nayaka paintings that covered theChola paintings in such a way that the Nayaka paintings, too, could be saved. Subbaraman removed the Nayaka paintings and pasted them on another mount. <br />    When Satyamurthy and Sriraman contacted Thyagarajan about photographingthe Chola frescoes, he accepted the assignment because of the challenges that the work presented. Thyagarajan, a 31-year-old post-graduate (Master ofFine Arts) from the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai, knew how difficult it was to make a mural because he was an artist himself. The technical difficulties he faced in reproducing the murals in the form of photographs involved their size, their location and their reflecting surfaces. "We solved the problems one by one," he said. <br />    Thyagarajan used the technique of montage in photography to deal with the enormous size of the paintings. "The only solution to the problem presented by size lay in photo montaging," he said. He took 40 to 50 frames of each painting, using digital photography, and assembled them in a computer toreproduce the whole painting. </p>
<p>    A ROYAL LADY in theKalyanasundaramurthi panel. It isreminiscent of the Ajanta tradition. </p>
<p>    But when he did the montaging, he found that the colours used in the murals differed from area to area. Besides, while the top portions were shadowy, there was light at the lower portions. "I had to balance the photo exposure from top to bottom [of the panel]," he said. The offsets created by the protruding pillars on the wall created difficulties because the murals continued on these offsets. Each panel had two offsets. It was not easy to photograph the continuation of the murals on these offsets. <br />    The murals were photographed frame by frame. But there were difficulties in joining the frames on computer using digital technology because the frames ended with a fine line. He mechanically divided the mural into frames without sacrificing the artistic elegance of the paintings or their aesthetic value. For instance, if the arm of a person in a mural was across two frames, they were joined on computer in such a manner that the difference wasnot apparent. <br />    "If we want to reproduce the aesthetic value of the paintings in the photographs, the montage should be 110 per cent exact. Only an artist who is technically qualified can do that," said Thyagarajan. </p>

<p>    According to Satyamurthy, several pieces of interesting information came to light when the murals were studied. For instance, in the mural that depicts Siva as Tripurantaka, there is a portrayal of three men worshipping the Buddha. The three men were originally demons (Asuras) who had harassed the Devas. Siva could not destroy these three Asuras because they happened to be his devotees. So the Devas requested Vishnu to convert them to Buddhism. "This is a story of the native Tamil country. This story is found in Tamil Saivite literature. It is not found anywhere else in India. The story iscarved not only in stone in the Brihadisvara temple but portrayed in the painting," Satyamurthy said. <br />    He is glad that art historians who could not enjoy the Chola paintings in the dark corridor can now study their photographic reproductions in the Interpretation Centre. There are write-ups. Also on exhibition at the centre are the detached Nayaka paintings. </p>
<p>    THE location was a nightmare. There was not enough light and space, anduse of harsh lights was taboo. How to take photographs of the top portionsof the murals? <br />    The ASI men rigged up a platform that moved up and down like a lift. "The platform from which the photographs were taken had to move parallel to the panel. The lighting from the top to the bottom had to be uniform," said P.S. Sriraman, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist, ASI. There was a space of only six feet between the paintings and the camera. </p>

The choice reflects the desire of the king to be treated on par with Sundarar who is the cherished friend of the God. Even otherwise this panel throws out a plethora of information on the contemporary life. We will be looking cl0sely at this panel.<br />    The earlier talk on 2-5-09, titled, In appreciation of Chola murals - Commingling of emotions was well attended and appreciated. The substance of the talk was:<br />    Calambur Siavaramamurthi, succinctly captures the greatness of the Chola murals. “If expression has to be taken as the criterion, by whicha great art has to be judged, it is here in abundance in these Chola paintings..". If Chola art is to be accepted as a great work of art, it needs tobe seen by all. How many of us had the privilege to be allowed into the dark circumambulatory passage around the sanctum of the Brihadisvara temple, where the paintings are found? Perhaps very few. Of course, all could not be allowed in there due to paucity of space and delicate condition of the murals. Therefore, ASI launched a documentation project to photograph these murals so that exact photographic reproductions can be kept on view. The task turned out to be a tough one with many challenges to surmount. This presentation will highlight how the task was accomplished and how now we are in a position to realise Sivaramaurthi's words are true.<br />    About the speaker:<br />    Thiru Sriraman has a post-graduation in Ancient History and Archaeologyand a PG Diploma in Archaeology, and is presently an Assistant Superintending Archaeologist with the Archaeological Survey of India.

<p>  Dear Sivasekaran,</p>
<p>  Thanking you very much for presenting all informations, writings and photographs on the Chola Murals at Thanjavur which are very informative. </p>
<p>  In one of these Murals it is noted, just on the right side of Siva as Thiripuraanthaha in red colour, we see an image in orange colour of an individual in standing position. When this image is enlarged it is clearly visiblethat it is more like that of a royal personality, and it is noted from thehead dress, the anatomical proportion of the body and style of standing ofthis personality in this image resembles the (modern) Rajaraja Chola statue seen out side the Thanjavur Temple complex. Could this be the mural Imageof Rajaraja Chola - 1, or was it from this mural image the modern statue of Rajaraja was shaped ??? Can you or any others well versed in the study ofthese Murals kindly enlighten me on same. </p>

<p>    Photographic feat <br />    T.S. SUBRAMANIAN </p>
<p>    The inaccessible Chola murals at the Big Temple in Thanjavur have been captured in almost life-size photographs and displayed at the temple. </p>
<p>    The Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>    IN a remarkable feat performed in the face of overwhelming odds, two officers of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and a young photographerhave photographed in minute detail four huge frescoes found in the Brihadisvara temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. What makes their work all the more creditable is the difficult location of the murals, their enormous size and their reflecting surface, all of which posed big challenges. </p>
<p>    PHOTOGRAPHS: T. SATYAMURTHY AND N. THYAGARAJAN/ ASI </p>
<p>    The passage around the sanctum sanctorum where the murals were found. </p>
<p>    The murals, each 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide (4.5 metres x 3 metres),are about 1,000 years old. They are located in the narrow and dark passagearound the temple's sanctum sanctorum. The great Chola king Raja Raja I built the Brihadisvara temple between AD 1000 and AD 1008 and the paintings were done between AD 1008 and AD 1012. </p>

<p>    If most visitors had hitherto no access to these paintings because of their location, they can now relish the paintings' exact photographic reproductions, which are on display at the newly opened Interpretation Centre on the temple premises. The photographs measure nine feet by six feet. </p>
<p>    A montage gives a more accurate reproduction of the mural. </p>
<p>    The credit for photographing the murals in exact detail, capturing their texture and colour, goes to the team comprising Dr. T. Satyamurthy, who was Superintending Archaeologist, ASI, Chennai Circle, when the project was executed; P.S. Sriraman, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist; and N. Thyagarajan, artist and photographer. </p>
<p>      PHOTOGRAPHS: T. SATYAMURTHY AND N. THYAGARAJAN/ ASI </p>

<p>    The four paintings depict Siva as Dakshinamurthy, the story of Tamil Saivite saint Sundarar, Siva as Tripurantaka, and Raja Raja Chola and his family worshipping Nataraja (Siva) at the Chidambaram temple. The paintings, rich in detail, offer a lot of historical information. While all the frescoes in the Brihadisvara temple together occupy 660 square metres, these four paintings alone take up 110 sq m. </p>

<p>    Photographing the murals was extremely difficult because they are painted on both walls of the dark, dingy and narrow passage, which has no ventilation. The space between the two walls is less than seven feet, so there isnot much space for the photographer to step back and capture images. Sincethe paintings are 15 feet tall, one must crane one's neck to look at the top portions. Most visitors are not allowed to see these paintings because of the narrowness of the passage and the poor light and ventilation. </p>

<p>    Satyamurthy said: "The ASI, Chennai Circle, therefore, undertook a project to photograph the murals, prepare photographic reproductions and display them in almost their true size and original colours. This effort requiredspecial techniques because of paucity of space, poor lighting and the enormous size of the murals. They had to be photographed in many small frames and then joined to make one frame. This effort needed high skill." </p>

<p>    Sriraman said: "What is seen in the paintings is seen in the frames. Wehave assembled the photographs without loss of perspective. Anybody can see the paintings in their original dimensions in our photographs." He explained why the ASI decided to go public with the paintings: "Documentation is important because people of the next generation should know that these paintings existed. Recopying is important. In photography, you get accurate reproduction." </p>

<p>    What prompted Satyamurthy and Sriraman to get the murals photographed was that while a number of books had been written about the Ajanta and Ellora paintings and research done on them, there was virtually no publication on the Chola paintings in the Brihadisvara temple. </p>
<p>   It was in 1931 that these four, and other, murals in the temple were discovered by S.K. Govindaswami of Tamil Nadu. He wrote to The Hindu about it.The relevant news item in The Hindu of April 11, 1931, reads: </p>
<p>    "Thousand years old Chola frescoes <br />    Reported discovery in Tanjore Big Temple <br />    Mr. S.K. Govindaswami, M.A., Annamalai University, writes to us under date 10th instant: - </p>
<p>    SIVA AS TRIPURANTAKA, who subdued the three demons. </p>
<p>    Close upon the discovery of the Pallava paintings in the Kailasanathaswami Temple at Conjeevaram by the French savant, the indefatigable Prof. Jouveau Dubreuil, it has been my great good fortune to bring to light the hitherto unknown frescoes of the Imperial Chola period, in the Brihadeswaraswami Temple, popularly known as `The Big Temple of Tanjore'." </p>
<p>    When Govindaswami visited the temple in 1930, he found "in the dim religious light of a small oil lamp... the existence of some kind of paintings on the walls on either side of a dark, narrow circumambulatory passage around the sanctum sanctorum". <br />    When he returned to the temple in 1931 and examined the place thoroughly with the help of a "Baby Petromax", he found that the bright light indeedrevealed paintings. "But paintings of an undoubtedly very late and degenerate age, whose linear contortions and chromatic extravagances shattered in a moment all my wonderful dreams of discovering there the best and the onlyexample of the art of Chola mural paintings. Still I chose a part of the western wall for close inspection and found the painted plastering there cracked all over and threatening to fall down. A gentle touch and the whole mass crumbled down, exposing underneath a fine series of frescoes palpitatingwith the life of the other days." </p>
<p>    THE INTERPRETATION CENTRE at the temple complex, where the photographs are on show. </p>
<p>    Govindaswami went on to describe the paintings in his letter to The Hindu, adding: "The discovery of these paintings is of great importance to thehistory of South Indian art. Hitherto, the Pallavas held exclusively the palm for mural paintings in the Tamil country. The Cholas may now be believed to divide the honours equally with the Pallavas not only in the South Indian architecture and sculpture but also in South Indian painting. For I have little doubt, judging from the excellence of the drawings, the colour scheme and the fresco-technique, that these paintings belong to the best period of Chola rule, to the glorious reign of Raja Raja the Great, and contemporary with the building of the Great Temple at Tanjore." <br />    The paintings with "linear contortions and chromatic extravagances" of the "very late and degenerate age", which covered the Chola murals before Govindaswami discovered the latter, were those of the Nayakas and were done in the 16th and 17th centuries. <br />    In terms of the area they occupy, the Chola paintings in the Brihadisvara temple rank next only to the Buddhist paintings at Ajanta in Maharashtra. While the murals at Ajanta come under the tempera variety, those at the Big Temple are called frescoes. The artists at Ajanta applied a coat of plaster on the wall of the caves and did the paintings after the plaster dried up. The paintings survive to this day because the painting material holds together the pigment in it and the plaster. <br />    But the Chola-age artists used a more difficult technique at the Brihadisvara temple. They applied lime plaster on the wall and painted the muralson the plaster while it was still wet. This demanded that they should do the sketches and complete the painting before the lime plaster dried up. This is not easy given the humidity conditions in Tamil Nadu. In this technique, the paintings formed part and parcel of the thin lime plaster. Sriraman said, "Here both the plaster and the painting integrate together. The frescoes are, therefore, more durable but their execution is very difficult." <br />    In the 1960s, Subbaraman, the Superintending Chemist of the ASI, discovered a technique by which he stripped the Nayaka paintings that covered theChola paintings in such a way that the Nayaka paintings, too, could be saved. Subbaraman removed the Nayaka paintings and pasted them on another mount. <br />    When Satyamurthy and Sriraman contacted Thyagarajan about photographingthe Chola frescoes, he accepted the assignment because of the challenges that the work presented. Thyagarajan, a 31-year-old post-graduate (Master ofFine Arts) from the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai, knew how difficult it was to make a mural because he was an artist himself. The technical difficulties he faced in reproducing the murals in the form of photographs involved their size, their location and their reflecting surfaces. "We solved the problems one by one," he said. <br />    Thyagarajan used the technique of montage in photography to deal with the enormous size of the paintings. "The only solution to the problem presented by size lay in photo montaging," he said. He took 40 to 50 frames of each painting, using digital photography, and assembled them in a computer toreproduce the whole painting. </p>
<p>    A ROYAL LADY in theKalyanasundaramurthi panel. It isreminiscent of the Ajanta tradition. </p>
<p>    But when he did the montaging, he found that the colours used in the murals differed from area to area. Besides, while the top portions were shadowy, there was light at the lower portions. "I had to balance the photo exposure from top to bottom [of the panel]," he said. The offsets created by the protruding pillars on the wall created difficulties because the murals continued on these offsets. Each panel had two offsets. It was not easy to photograph the continuation of the murals on these offsets. <br />    The murals were photographed frame by frame. But there were difficulties in joining the frames on computer using digital technology because the frames ended with a fine line. He mechanically divided the mural into frames without sacrificing the artistic elegance of the paintings or their aesthetic value. For instance, if the arm of a person in a mural was across two frames, they were joined on computer in such a manner that the difference wasnot apparent. <br />    "If we want to reproduce the aesthetic value of the paintings in the photographs, the montage should be 110 per cent exact. Only an artist who is technically qualified can do that," said Thyagarajan. </p>

<p>    According to Satyamurthy, several pieces of interesting information came to light when the murals were studied. For instance, in the mural that depicts Siva as Tripurantaka, there is a portrayal of three men worshipping the Buddha. The three men were originally demons (Asuras) who had harassed the Devas. Siva could not destroy these three Asuras because they happened to be his devotees. So the Devas requested Vishnu to convert them to Buddhism. "This is a story of the native Tamil country. This story is found in Tamil Saivite literature. It is not found anywhere else in India. The story iscarved not only in stone in the Brihadisvara temple but portrayed in the painting," Satyamurthy said. <br />    He is glad that art historians who could not enjoy the Chola paintings in the dark corridor can now study their photographic reproductions in the Interpretation Centre. There are write-ups. Also on exhibition at the centre are the detached Nayaka paintings. </p>
<p>    THE location was a nightmare. There was not enough light and space, anduse of harsh lights was taboo. How to take photographs of the top portionsof the murals? <br />    The ASI men rigged up a platform that moved up and down like a lift. "The platform from which the photographs were taken had to move parallel to the panel. The lighting from the top to the bottom had to be uniform," said P.S. Sriraman, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist, ASI. There was a space of only six feet between the paintings and the camera. </p>

The choice reflects the desire of the king to be treated on par with Sundarar who is the cherished friend of the God. Even otherwise this panel throws out a plethora of information on the contemporary life. We will be looking cl0sely at this panel.<br />    The earlier talk on 2-5-09, titled, In appreciation of Chola murals - Commingling of emotions was well attended and appreciated. The substance of the talk was:<br />    Calambur Siavaramamurthi, succinctly captures the greatness of the Chola murals. “If expression has to be taken as the criterion, by whicha great art has to be judged, it is here in abundance in these Chola paintings..". If Chola art is to be accepted as a great work of art, it needs tobe seen by all. How many of us had the privilege to be allowed into the dark circumambulatory passage around the sanctum of the Brihadisvara temple, where the paintings are found? Perhaps very few. Of course, all could not be allowed in there due to paucity of space and delicate condition of the murals. Therefore, ASI launched a documentation project to photograph these murals so that exact photographic reproductions can be kept on view. The task turned out to be a tough one with many challenges to surmount. This presentation will highlight how the task was accomplished and how now we are in a position to realise Sivaramaurthi's words are true.<br />    About the speaker:<br />    Thiru Sriraman has a post-graduation in Ancient History and Archaeologyand a PG Diploma in Archaeology, and is presently an Assistant Superintending Archaeologist with the Archaeological Survey of India. He has rich experience in his field. He has conducted several excavations at Banahalli, a proto-historic site in Karnataka, Gingee, a medieval site and Mahabalipuram,an early historical site. He has explored several regions in Karnataka andTamilnadu leading to the discoveries of several important archaeological sites. He was instrumental in the reorganization of the sites museum at Lothal, a Harappa Civilization site, the Fort Museum, Fort St George Chennai including the new gallery on Prints.<br />    He has conceived, designed and organised the Interpretation Centre at the Brihadisvara temple, Tanjavur and conceived, co-ordinated the Documentation of Chola Murals at Brihadisvara temple at Tanjavur and the Surface features at Kailasanatha temple, Kanchipuram.<br />    Thiru Sriraman has published a number research papers in reputed journals, has designed and conceived several brochures and handouts for monumentsof South India and is currently enganed in writing a book on Chola murals. </p>

        <p>Dear Sivasekaran,</p>
<p>Thanking you very much for presenting all informations, writings and photographs on the Chola Murals at Thanjavur which are very informative. </p>
<p>In one of these Murals it is noted, just on the right side of Siva as Thiripuraanthaha in red colour, we see an image in orange colour of an individual in standing position. When this image is enlarged it is clearly visible that it is more like that of a royal personality, and it is noted from the head dress, the anatomical proportion of the body and style of standing of this personality in this image resembles the (modern) Rajaraja Chola statue seen out side the Thanjavur Temple complex. Could this be the mural Image of Rajaraja Chola - 1, or was it from this mural image the modern statue of Rajaraja was shaped ??? Can you or any others well versed in the study of these Murals kindly enlighten me on same. </p>

<p>  An old article in the Frontline covered the archaeologists and the photographer as well as their techniques quite well.  It would be great if the image file is available online.<br />   <br />  -Mani<br />   <br />   <br />  Vol:24 Iss:10 URL: <a href="http://www.flonnet.com/fl2410/stories/20070601000106500.htm" title="http://www.flonnet.com/fl2410/stories/20070601000106500.htm">http://www.flonnet.com/fl2410/stories/20070601000106500.htm</a> </p>

<p>  Photographic feat <br />  T.S. SUBRAMANIAN </p>
<p>  The inaccessible Chola murals at the Big Temple in Thanjavur have been captured in almost life-size photographs and displayed at the temple. </p>
<p>  The Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>  IN a remarkable feat performed in the face of overwhelming odds, two officers of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and a young photographer have photographed in minute detail four huge frescoes found in the Brihadisvara temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. What makes their work all the more creditable is the difficult location of the murals, their enormous size and their reflecting surface, all of which posed big challenges. </p>

<p>  The passage around the sanctum sanctorum where the murals were found. </p>
<p>  The murals, each 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide (4.5 metres x 3 metres), are about 1,000 years old. They are located in the narrow and dark passage around the temple's sanctum sanctorum. The great Chola king Raja Raja I built the Brihadisvara temple between AD 1000 and AD 1008 and the paintings were done between AD 1008 and AD 1012. </p>

<p>  If most visitors had hitherto no access to these paintings because of their location, they can now relish the paintings' exact photographic reproductions, which are on display at the newly opened Interpretation Centre on the temple premises. The photographs measure nine feet by six feet. </p>
<p>  A montage gives a more accurate reproduction of the mural. </p>
<p>  The credit for photographing the murals in exact detail, capturing their texture and colour, goes to the team comprising Dr. T. Satyamurthy, who wasSuperintending Archaeologist, ASI, Chennai Circle, when the project was executed; P.S. Sriraman, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist; and N. Thyagarajan, artist and photographer. </p>

<p>  The four paintings depict Siva as Dakshinamurthy, the story of Tamil Saivite saint Sundarar, Siva as Tripurantaka, and Raja Raja Chola and his family worshipping Nataraja (Siva) at the Chidambaram temple. The paintings, rich in detail, offer a lot of historical information. While all the frescoes in the Brihadisvara temple together occupy 660 square metres, these four paintings alone take up 110 sq m. </p>

<p>  Photographing the murals was extremely difficult because they are paintedon both walls of the dark, dingy and narrow passage, which has no ventilation. The space between the two walls is less than seven feet, so there is not much space for the photographer to step back and capture images. Since the paintings are 15 feet tall, one must crane one's neck to look at the topportions. Most visitors are not allowed to see these paintings because of the narrowness of the passage and the poor light and ventilation. </p>

<p>  Satyamurthy said: "The ASI, Chennai Circle, therefore, undertook a project to photograph the murals, prepare photographic reproductions and display them in almost their true size and original colours. This effort required special techniques because of paucity of space, poor lighting and the enormous size of the murals. They had to be photographed in many small frames andthen joined to make one frame. This effort needed high skill." </p>

<p>  Sriraman said: "What is seen in the paintings is seen in the frames. We have assembled the photographs without loss of perspective. Anybody can see the paintings in their original dimensions in our photographs." He explained why the ASI decided to go public with the paintings: "Documentation is important because people of the next generation should know that these paintings existed. Recopying is important. In photography, you get accurate reproduction." </p>

<p>  What prompted Satyamurthy and Sriraman to get the murals photographed wasthat while a number of books had been written about the Ajanta and Ellora paintings and research done on them, there was virtually no publication on the Chola paintings in the Brihadisvara temple. </p>
<p> It was in 1931 that these four, and other, murals in the temple were discovered by S.K. Govindaswami of Tamil Nadu. He wrote to The Hindu about it. The relevant news item in The Hindu of April 11, 1931, reads: </p>
<p>  "Thousand years old Chola frescoes <br />  Reported discovery in Tanjore Big Temple <br />  Mr. S.K. Govindaswami, M.A., Annamalai University, writes to us under date 10th instant: - </p>
<p>  SIVA AS TRIPURANTAKA, who subdued the three demons. </p>
<p>  Close upon the discovery of the Pallava paintings in the Kailasanathaswami Temple at Conjeevaram by the French savant, the indefatigable Prof. Jouveau Dubreuil, it has been my great good fortune to bring to light the hitherto unknown frescoes of the Imperial Chola period, in the Brihadeswaraswami Temple, popularly known as `The Big Temple of Tanjore'." </p>
<p>  When Govindaswami visited the temple in 1930, he found "in the dim religious light of a small oil lamp... the existence of some kind of paintings onthe walls on either side of a dark, narrow circumambulatory passage aroundthe sanctum sanctorum". <br />  When he returned to the temple in 1931 and examined the place thoroughly with the help of a "Baby Petromax", he found that the bright light indeed revealed paintings. "But paintings of an undoubtedly very late and degenerate age, whose linear contortions and chromatic extravagances shattered in a moment all my wonderful dreams of discovering there the best and the only example of the art of Chola mural paintings. Still I chose a part of the western wall for close inspection and found the painted plastering there cracked all over and threatening to fall down. A gentle touch and the whole masscrumbled down, exposing underneath a fine series of frescoes palpitating with the life of the other days." </p>
<p>  THE INTERPRETATION CENTRE at the temple complex, where the photographs are on show. </p>
<p>  Govindaswami went on to describe the paintings in his letter to The Hindu, adding: "The discovery of these paintings is of great importance to the history of South Indian art. Hitherto, the Pallavas held exclusively the palm for mural paintings in the Tamil country. The Cholas may now be believed to divide the honours equally with the Pallavas not only in the South Indian architecture and sculpture but also in South Indian painting. For I have little doubt, judging from the excellence of the drawings, the colour scheme and the fresco-technique, that these paintings belong to the best period of Chola rule, to the glorious reign of Raja Raja the Great, and contemporary with the building of the Great Temple at Tanjore." <br />  The paintings with "linear contortions and chromatic extravagances" of the "very late and degenerate age", which covered the Chola murals before Govindaswami discovered the latter, were those of the Nayakas and were done inthe 16th and 17th centuries. <br />  In terms of the area they occupy, the Chola paintings in the Brihadisvaratemple rank next only to the Buddhist paintings at Ajanta in Maharashtra. While the murals at Ajanta come under the tempera variety, those at the BigTemple are called frescoes. The artists at Ajanta applied a coat of plaster on the wall of the caves and did the paintings after the plaster dried up. The paintings survive to this day because the painting material holds together the pigment in it and the plaster. <br />  But the Chola-age artists used a more difficult technique at the Brihadisvara temple. They applied lime plaster on the wall and painted the murals on the plaster while it was still wet. This demanded that they should do thesketches and complete the painting before the lime plaster dried up. This is not easy given the humidity conditions in Tamil Nadu. In this technique,the paintings formed part and parcel of the thin lime plaster. Sriraman said, "Here both the plaster and the painting integrate together. The frescoes are, therefore, more durable but their execution is very difficult." <br />  In the 1960s, Subbaraman, the Superintending Chemist of the ASI, discovered a technique by which he stripped the Nayaka paintings that covered the Chola paintings in such a way that the Nayaka paintings, too, could be saved. Subbaraman removed the Nayaka paintings and pasted them on another mount. <br />  When Satyamurthy and Sriraman contacted Thyagarajan about photographing the Chola frescoes, he accepted the assignment because of the challenges that the work presented. Thyagarajan, a 31-year-old post-graduate (Master of Fine Arts) from the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai, knew how difficult it was to make a mural because he was an artist himself. The technicaldifficulties he faced in reproducing the murals in the form of photographsinvolved their size, their location and their reflecting surfaces. "We solved the problems one by one," he said. <br />  Thyagarajan used the technique of montage in photography to deal with theenormous size of the paintings. "The only solution to the problem presented by size lay in photo montaging," he said. He took 40 to 50 frames of eachpainting, using digital photography, and assembled them in a computer to reproduce the whole painting. </p>

<p>  But when he did the montaging, he found that the colours used in the murals differed from area to area. Besides, while the top portions were shadowy, there was light at the lower portions. "I had to balance the photo exposure from top to bottom [of the panel]," he said. The offsets created by the protruding pillars on the wall created difficulties because the murals continued on these offsets. Each panel had two offsets. It was not easy to photograph the continuation of the murals on these offsets. <br />  The murals were photographed frame by frame. But there were difficulties in joining the frames on computer using digital technology because the frames ended with a fine line. He mechanically divided the mural into frames without sacrificing the artistic elegance of the paintings or their aestheticvalue. For instance, if the arm of a person in a mural was across two frames, they were joined on computer in such a manner that the difference was not apparent. <br />  "If we want to reproduce the aesthetic value of the paintings in the photographs, the montage should be 110 per cent exact. Only an artist who is technically qualified can do that," said Thyagarajan. </p>

<p>  According to Satyamurthy, several pieces of interesting information came to light when the murals were studied. For instance, in the mural that depicts Siva as Tripurantaka, there is a portrayal of three men worshipping theBuddha. The three men were originally demons (Asuras) who had harassed theDevas. Siva could not destroy these three Asuras because they happened to be his devotees. So the Devas requested Vishnu to convert them to Buddhism."This is a story of the native Tamil country. This story is found in TamilSaivite literature. It is not found anywhere else in India. The story is carved not only in stone in the Brihadisvara temple but portrayed in the painting," Satyamurthy said. <br />  He is glad that art historians who could not enjoy the Chola paintings inthe dark corridor can now study their photographic reproductions in the Interpretation Centre. There are write-ups. Also on exhibition at the centre are the detached Nayaka paintings. </p>
<p>  THE location was a nightmare. There was not enough light and space, and use of harsh lights was taboo. How to take photographs of the top portions of the murals? <br />  The ASI men rigged up a platform that moved up and down like a lift. "Theplatform from which the photographs were taken had to move parallel to thepanel. The lighting from the top to the bottom had to be uniform," said P.S. Sriraman, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist, ASI. There was a spaceof only six feet between the paintings and the camera. </p>

The choice reflects the desire of the king to be treated on par with Sundarar who is the cherished friend of the God. Even otherwise this panel throws out a plethora of information on the contemporary life. We will be looking cl0sely at this panel.<br />  The earlier talk on 2-5-09, titled, In appreciation of Chola murals - Commingling of emotions was well attended and appreciated. The substance of the talk was:<br />  Calambur Siavaramamurthi, succinctly captures the greatness of the Chola murals. “If expression has to be taken as the criterion, by which agreat art has to be judged, it is here in abundance in these Chola paintings..". If Chola art is to be accepted as a great work of art, it needs to be seen by all. How many of us had the privilege to be allowed into the darkcircumambulatory passage around the sanctum of the Brihadisvara temple, where the paintings are found? Perhaps very few. Of course, all could not be allowed in there due to paucity of space and delicate condition of the murals. Therefore, ASI launched a documentation project to photograph these murals so that exact photographic reproductions can be kept on view. The task turned out to be a tough one with many challenges to surmount. This presentation will highlight how the task was accomplished and how now we are in a position to realise Sivaramaurthi's words are true.<br />  About the speaker:<br />  Thiru Sriraman has a post-graduation in Ancient History and Archaeology and a PG Diploma in Archaeology, and is presently an Assistant Superintending Archaeologist with the Archaeological Survey of India. He has rich experience in his field. He has conducted several excavations at Banahalli, a proto-historic site in Karnataka, Gingee, a medieval site and Mahabalipuram, an early historical site.
