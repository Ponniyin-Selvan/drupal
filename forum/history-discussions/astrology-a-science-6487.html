<p>If statistics, psychology and economics can be called sciences then <br />astrology can also be called a science. I 'believe' the evidence can <br />be statistically proven. Just because we don't know how it works, it <br />should not mean it does not work. </p>
<p>As you will be aware, there are numerous websites dedicated to <br />astrology and defend it vehemently. A couple are below:</p>
<p><a href="http://astrology.uk70.com/info/astrology5.htm" title="http://astrology.uk70.com/info/astrology5.htm">http://astrology.uk70.com/info/astrology5.htm</a><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/119299.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/119299.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/119299.stm</a></p>
<p>However, astrology is now highly commercialised and I certainly don't <br />trust any astrologers.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do believe that if you live your life by taking <br />responsibility for all your actions and believe in re-incarnation <br />then there is no need for astrology. </p>

<p>     What do you mean by "where did this arise from"? It is a <br />completely<br />     biological process. And then the growth of the body is based on <br />the<br />     nutrients it receives.. so again conservation of mass and energy.</p>
<p>    What I mean is, science as we are generally familiar with, does <br />not have a<br />    proper explanation on the origin of any mass. We are only working <br />with a few<br />    proposed theories. This is vastly different from conducting a <br />regular<br />    scientific experiment to repeat it and get the exact results. <br />There are just<br />    too many factors around that we still have absolutely no clue of. <br />So we are<br />    only relying on what is currently established by (modern) science <br />and we<br />    most definitely can not accept that as the absolute proof for <br />everything<br />    that happens in life. There are vast realms of unproven content <br />that defy<br />    (so called) scientific proof. For this biological process as you <br />have<br />    outlined, there must surely be a bio-memory. Even if you may call <br />it<br />    (simplistically) as a genetic code, did it just happen? Is there  <br />any<br />    accountable scientific proof of how that happened yet?</p></sandeepnet@...></p></blockquote>

        <p>LOL:) I tend to agree with you although I would reserve that argument <br />for those of us in second half of life, in other words it is best <br />learnt via experience :))</p>

<p>    ravi, I agree with you that astrology has depth to it that has <br />    probably been lost over time. And I am not any scholar either :) <br />But <br />    my personal experience has been that vedic/tibetan <br />buddhist/chinese <br />    astrologies do not work same way or give same interpretations. <br />Even <br />    how the charts are drawn are very different. One has to go with <br />what <br />    works for one personally.</p>
<p>    Where the human will is involved no accuracy is possible, that is <br />  the <br />    whole point. Astrology deals with humans who are capable of <br />changing <br />    their minds and so how can it possibly be an accurate science? <br />The <br />    word science loosely used often means factual accuracy, although <br />as <br />    you rightly said it can be extended to mean a host of other <br />things. </p>
<p>    I agree 100% with moon affecting tides. My uncle who works with <br />    mentally disabled often talks about moon affecting schizophrenics <br />  and <br />    seriously mentally ill people. I can talk at great length about <br />moon <br />    effect on certain feminine issues too (out of place in this <br />forum). </p>
<p>    Bottom line I think - for Kathy and Arun perhaps - you dont' have <br />to <br />    believe in Astrology or anything. Just don't dismiss as hocus <br />pocus <br />    what works for others, and has depth and wisdom that is not <br />easily <br />    comprehended.:) It is not really without reason that so much <br />  research <br />    goes into UFOs and FBI uses psychics too, isn't it not :)</p>

<p>      I am no scholar, but in my humble opinion, i tend to believe in <br />      astrology as a superior form of science which humans cannot <br />master <br />  -</p>
<p>      yet or have lost the skill.</p>
<p>      Definition of Science from some dictionaries:<br />      Science refers to a system of acquiring knowledge. This system <br />  uses <br />      observation and experimentation to describe and explain natural <br />      phenomena. The term science also refers to the organized body <br />of <br />      knowledge people have gained using that system. Less formally, <br />the <br />      word science often describes any systematic field of study or <br />the <br />      knowledge gained from it.</p>
<p>      Astrology is a series of knowledge based on numbers and <br />patterns, <br />      astrologers observe, experiment and try to explain something <br />that <br />    is <br />      natural just that it happens in the future, which makes it a <br />      speculation.</p>
<p>      By method of common deduction, if you consider all religions <br />and <br />    their <br />      astrological and remove the name buddhist/vedic/chinese etc you <br />    will <br />      find that there is an astro common ground. So common deduction <br />    method <br />      logically proves astrology presence, where religions tap into <br />that <br />    and <br />      give a flavor of Almighty to it.</p>
<p>      Many a time you can find two different doctors giving two types <br />of <br />      treatment for same symptom, well that concept is applicable to <br />any <br />      study - interpretation is subject to the individual mind. Just <br />    because <br />      two astrologers differ that does not mean the chart is changed. <br />  The <br />      study of that chart is science, navagraha - are in essence <br />planets <br />    and <br />      their shades or dust. It is no myth that the sun/moon/mars etc <br />  have <br />      their electro magnetic impulses on earth, we , humans , being <br />    composed <br />      of base carbon that evolved from the mega dust, will respond to <br />    these <br />      cosmic 'beings'. When the great oceans raise on full tide <br />during <br />    the <br />      full moon, how can we not respond the the 'lord Chandra' - lets <br />    call <br />      it logic :-)</p>

<p>        Ravi, I agree with you to some extent that Astrology is not <br />        completely to do with God. But Astrology does have a lot to <br />do <br />    with <br />        religion. There is vedic astrology, tibetan budddhist <br />astrology <br />    and <br />        western takes on astrology. Vedic astrology which is what is <br />  most <br />        common in India is got a lot to do with religion and <br />appeasing <br />        navagrahas if necessary, it is impossible to separate the <br />      two.Tibetan <br />        Buddhist astrology is wholly related to Buddhist principles. </p>
<p>        I believe in astrology to some extent myslef, am not a non <br />    believer. <br />        But astrology is not a science no matter how you look at it, <br />    since <br />        two very good astrologers can give very different <br />  interpretations <br />    of <br />        the same chart. What happens in reality of course can be an <br />    entirely <br />        third interpretation also.</p>

<p>          Astrology has nothing to do with God. I dont understand <br />what <br />    your <br />        drag <br />          on God is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>          Any musician cannot become a Beethoven, similarly any <br />    astrologer <br />          cannot become the astrologer. The art of perfection does <br />not <br />    take <br />      a <br />          few credit hours to finish, it takes almost a life time.</p>
<p>          A typical good astrologist would be brilliant in numbers <br />and <br />        amazing <br />          in multi co-relational thinking and mapping. Something that <br />    takes <br />        ages <br />          to master.</p>
<p>          I think you are confusing astrology with religion / God <br />etc, <br />    that <br />        is <br />          not appropriate. </p>
<p>          Again, Astrology is an art and science is a small part of <br />it. <br />    Math <br />        is <br />          the basic building block of astrology.</p>
<p>          If you want to debate Dawkins thats a different thread, i <br />am <br />    sure <br />          there are enough religious nuts here who can graduate him <br />to <br />      become <br />        a <br />          fully baked nut. :-)</p>

          Is astrology a science?        </div>

<p>I got your point, 'vidhiyai madhiyal vellalam' nu solaringa - correct, <br />naan solrathu enna na - vithiyai mathiyal vellalam nu vidhi la ezuthi <br />iruntha thaan vella mudiyum'... </p>
<p>I believe, this vidhi is pre-programmed already, like i said in one of <br />the earlier posts, we just see it as the universe unfolds.</p>

Even <br />  how the charts are drawn are very different. One has to go with what <br />  works for one personally.</p>
<p>  Where the human will is involved no accuracy is possible, that is <br />the <br />  whole point. Astrology deals with humans who are capable of changing <br />  their minds and so how can it possibly be an accurate science? The <br />  word science loosely used often means factual accuracy, although as <br />  you rightly said it can be extended to mean a host of other things. </p>
<p>  I agree 100% with moon affecting tides. My uncle who works with <br />  mentally disabled often talks about moon affecting schizophrenics <br />and <br />  seriously mentally ill people. I can talk at great length about moon <br />  effect on certain feminine issues too (out of place in this forum). </p>
<p>  Bottom line I think - for Kathy and Arun perhaps - you dont' have to <br />  believe in Astrology or anything. Just don't dismiss as hocus pocus <br />  what works for others, and has depth and wisdom that is not easily <br />  comprehended.:) It is not really without reason that so much <br />research <br />  goes into UFOs and FBI uses psychics too, isn't it not :)</p>

<p>    I am no scholar, but in my humble opinion, i tend to believe in <br />    astrology as a superior form of science which humans cannot master <br />-</p>
<p>    yet or have lost the skill.</p>
<p>    Definition of Science from some dictionaries:<br />    Science refers to a system of acquiring knowledge. This system <br />uses <br />    observation and experimentation to describe and explain natural <br />    phenomena. The term science also refers to the organized body of <br />    knowledge people have gained using that system. Less formally, the <br />    word science often describes any systematic field of study or the <br />    knowledge gained from it.</p>
<p>    Astrology is a series of knowledge based on numbers and patterns, <br />    astrologers observe, experiment and try to explain something that <br />  is <br />    natural just that it happens in the future, which makes it a <br />    speculation.</p>
<p>    By method of common deduction, if you consider all religions and <br />  their <br />    astrological and remove the name buddhist/vedic/chinese etc you <br />  will <br />    find that there is an astro common ground. So common deduction <br />  method <br />    logically proves astrology presence, where religions tap into that <br />  and <br />    give a flavor of Almighty to it.</p>
<p>    Many a time you can find two different doctors giving two types of <br />    treatment for same symptom, well that concept is applicable to any <br />    study - interpretation is subject to the individual mind. Just <br />  because <br />    two astrologers differ that does not mean the chart is changed. <br />The <br />    study of that chart is science, navagraha - are in essence planets <br />  and <br />    their shades or dust. It is no myth that the sun/moon/mars etc <br />have <br />    their electro magnetic impulses on earth, we , humans , being <br />  composed <br />    of base carbon that evolved from the mega dust, will respond to <br />  these <br />    cosmic 'beings'. When the great oceans raise on full tide during <br />  the <br />    full moon, how can we not respond the the 'lord Chandra' - lets <br />  call <br />    it logic :-)</p>

<p>      Ravi, I agree with you to some extent that Astrology is not <br />      completely to do with God. But Astrology does have a lot to do <br />  with <br />      religion. There is vedic astrology, tibetan budddhist astrology <br />  and <br />      western takes on astrology. Vedic astrology which is what is <br />most <br />      common in India is got a lot to do with religion and appeasing <br />      navagrahas if necessary, it is impossible to separate the <br />    two.Tibetan <br />      Buddhist astrology is wholly related to Buddhist principles. </p>
<p>      I believe in astrology to some extent myslef, am not a non <br />  believer. <br />      But astrology is not a science no matter how you look at it, <br />  since <br />      two very good astrologers can give very different <br />interpretations <br />  of <br />      the same chart. What happens in reality of course can be an <br />  entirely <br />      third interpretation also.</p>

<p>        Astrology has nothing to do with God. I dont understand what <br />  your <br />      drag <br />        on God is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>        Any musician cannot become a Beethoven, similarly any <br />  astrologer <br />        cannot become the astrologer. The art of perfection does not <br />  take <br />    a <br />        few credit hours to finish, it takes almost a life time.</p>
<p>        A typical good astrologist would be brilliant in numbers and <br />      amazing <br />        in multi co-relational thinking and mapping. Something that <br />  takes <br />      ages <br />        to master.</p>
<p>        I think you are confusing astrology with religion / God etc, <br />  that <br />      is <br />        not appropriate. </p>
<p>        Again, Astrology is an art and science is a small part of it. <br />  Math <br />      is <br />        the basic building block of astrology.</p>
<p>        If you want to debate Dawkins thats a different thread, i am <br />  sure <br />        there are enough religious nuts here who can graduate him to <br />    become <br />      a <br />        fully baked nut. :-)</p>

Astrology deals with humans who are capable of changing <br />their minds and so how can it possibly be an accurate science? The <br />word science loosely used often means factual accuracy, although as <br />you rightly said it can be extended to mean a host of other things. </p>
<p>I agree 100% with moon affecting tides. My uncle who works with <br />mentally disabled often talks about moon affecting schizophrenics and <br />seriously mentally ill people. I can talk at great length about moon <br />effect on certain feminine issues too (out of place in this forum). </p>
<p>Bottom line I think - for Kathy and Arun perhaps - you dont' have to <br />believe in Astrology or anything. Just don't dismiss as hocus pocus <br />what works for others, and has depth and wisdom that is not easily <br />comprehended.:) It is not really without reason that so much research <br />goes into UFOs and FBI uses psychics too, isn't it not :)</p>

<p>  Astrology is a series of knowledge based on numbers and patterns, <br />  astrologers observe, experiment and try to explain something that <br />is <br />  natural just that it happens in the future, which makes it a <br />  speculation.</p>
<p>  By method of common deduction, if you consider all religions and <br />their <br />  astrological and remove the name buddhist/vedic/chinese etc you <br />will <br />  find that there is an astro common ground. So common deduction <br />method <br />  logically proves astrology presence, where religions tap into that <br />and <br />  give a flavor of Almighty to it.</p>
<p>  Many a time you can find two different doctors giving two types of <br />  treatment for same symptom, well that concept is applicable to any <br />  study - interpretation is subject to the individual mind. Just <br />because <br />  two astrologers differ that does not mean the chart is changed. The <br />  study of that chart is science, navagraha - are in essence planets <br />and <br />  their shades or dust. It is no myth that the sun/moon/mars etc have <br />  their electro magnetic impulses on earth, we , humans , being <br />composed <br />  of base carbon that evolved from the mega dust, will respond to <br />these <br />  cosmic 'beings'. When the great oceans raise on full tide during <br />the <br />  full moon, how can we not respond the the 'lord Chandra' - lets <br />call <br />  it logic :-)</p>

<p>    Ravi, I agree with you to some extent that Astrology is not <br />    completely to do with God. But Astrology does have a lot to do <br />with <br />    religion. There is vedic astrology, tibetan budddhist astrology <br />and <br />    western takes on astrology. Vedic astrology which is what is most <br />    common in India is got a lot to do with religion and appeasing <br />    navagrahas if necessary, it is impossible to separate the <br />  two.Tibetan <br />    Buddhist astrology is wholly related to Buddhist principles. </p>
<p>    I believe in astrology to some extent myslef, am not a non <br />believer. <br />    But astrology is not a science no matter how you look at it, <br />since <br />    two very good astrologers can give very different interpretations <br />of <br />    the same chart.

<p>                    Thanks Sandeep. Maybe both are true. What I <br />  intended <br />    was the<br />              use<br />                of<br />                    science. Without knowing to read and write, <br />atleast <br />    numbers,<br />              you<br />                  cant<br />                    even use a cell phone.

<p>                    'Knowledge' differs from east and west. We <br />consider <br />  a <br />    person<br />              who<br />                can<br />                    read and write as educated, in terms of western <br />    education.<br />          But<br />              all<br />                    along the generations, only a few people in India <br />  knew <br />    to<br />          read<br />              and<br />                    write but still they had abundant knowledge. For <br />us<br />          education is<br />                    knowledge and reading and writing is just <br />literacy.<br />                    Am I sounding sarcastic? :)</p>

          Is astrology a science?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Ravi, I agree with you to some extent that Astrology is not <br />completely to do with God. But Astrology does have a lot to do with <br />religion. There is vedic astrology, tibetan budddhist astrology and <br />western takes on astrology. Vedic astrology which is what is most <br />common in India is got a lot to do with religion and appeasing <br />navagrahas if necessary, it is impossible to separate the two.Tibetan <br />Buddhist astrology is wholly related to Buddhist principles. </p>
<p>I believe in astrology to some extent myslef, am not a non believer. <br />But astrology is not a science no matter how you look at it, since <br />two very good astrologers can give very different interpretations of <br />the same chart. What happens in reality of course can be an entirely <br />third interpretation also.</p>

But even an ILLITERATE can <br />use <br />  the<br />              medicinal<br />                  value of Neem or turmeric. Thats what I intended to <br />  say.</p>
<p>                  'Knowledge' differs from east and west. We consider <br />a <br />  person<br />            who<br />              can<br />                  read and write as educated, in terms of western <br />  education.<br />        But<br />            all<br />                  along the generations, only a few people in India <br />knew <br />  to<br />        read<br />            and<br />                  write but still they had abundant knowledge. For us<br />        education is<br />                  knowledge and reading and writing is just literacy.<br />                  Am I sounding sarcastic? :)</p>
<p>                  Regards,<br />                  Satish<br />                ========================= </p>
<p>                Dear Satish,</p>
<p>                LITERATE :: Letter - reading - writing - <br />undeerstanding.</p>
<p>                KNOWLEDGE : Know... by one's self... Or also knowing <br />  where to<br />                know ..primarily knowing (knowledge) of source of <br />  Knowledge.</p>
<p>                EDUCATING : Uplifting the levels.. ?! (not referred<br />        Dictionary)</p>
<p>                And there is WISDOM ... derived from Wiseness.</p>

          Is astrology a science?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Astrology has nothing to do with God. I dont understand what your drag <br />on God is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>Any musician cannot become a Beethoven, similarly any astrologer <br />cannot become the astrologer. The art of perfection does not take a <br />few credit hours to finish, it takes almost a life time.</p>
<p>A typical good astrologist would be brilliant in numbers and amazing <br />in multi co-relational thinking and mapping. Something that takes ages <br />to master.</p>
<p>I think you are confusing astrology with religion / God etc, that is <br />not appropriate. </p>
<p>Again, Astrology is an art and science is a small part of it. Math is <br />the basic building block of astrology.</p>
<p>If you want to debate Dawkins thats a different thread, i am sure <br />there are enough religious nuts here who can graduate him to become a <br />fully baked nut. :-)</p>

        <p>Any nut is a nut. Dawkins's books are a retort against western <br />religion. I know you say western science and estern science do not <br />exist but you have to admit western religion and eastern religion do <br />exist and widely differ in their paradigms about God. Dawkins was <br />questioned extensively on PBS on concepts of onness, benefits of <br />yoga/meditation and buddhism among other things and he drew a <br />complete blank.</p>
<p>Books like these are necessary due to rise of post 911 religious <br />fundamentalistm in the west and it would be best if christian fundies <br />dealt with them, not us.</p>
<p>Deepak Chopra and Fritozv Capra are among pioneering scientific minds <br />who try to bridge this huge gap. If we want to talk about it we have <br />to talk of what they say, and perhaps with an intetion to <br />understanding what is positive on either side (mysticism/relgiion <br />versus science). <br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Arun Krishnan" <br /><drarunkrishnan@...  wrote:</p>

        <p>Really? Dawkins is a nut, a half baked atheist who attacks western <br />belief systems and is pretty ignorant on others belief systems. I <br />even saw an interveew with him on PBs, he was very unimpressive. <br />I suggest you become an EVR fan instead, a lot more well researched.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Deep thinking does not make something science nest ces pas?:)</p>
<p>  Arun</p></blockquote>
<p>I remarked some of Einsteins theory of relativity. Were those theories<br />originated by experiments and proved physically? Deep thinking<br />resulted in many a theories. Plane of reference,clock ticking slow in<br />outer space, e=mcsqared etc are physically impossible to prove and yet<br />accepted as science. </p>
<p>I already told you and you now accept, we can never come to conclusion<br />on these topics.</p>
<p>But from these discussions, we again find one thing - western<br />knowledge rejects everything beyond their understanding. If they<br />cannot understand something, they immediately reject it saying its<br />false or baseless and just a myth, belief. Eastern knowledge tries to<br />understand things which are not known to them. Whether you accept it<br />or not, thats the truth and thats the reason so many religions could<br />thrive in India where as rest of the world are so intolerant. Again,<br />the basics of sanathana dharma are so interlinked with nature and<br />nature is nothing but the so called science, driven by the physical<br />and chemical laws. </p>

        <p>Arun, I read it a long time ago, now you have inspired me to read it <br />again :) I didn't think the comparisons were far fetched, rather <br />extremely well thought out - a westerner normaly does not have an <br />agenda to prove these things right as it is in our culture so usually <br />it comes from a place of openness and is worth examining and <br />rethought.</p>
<p>I will try to listen to the cd again this week. What specifically did <br />you think was 'far fetched'?</p>

<p>                I think it should be the other way round.

Without knowing to read and write, atleast <br />numbers,<br />        you<br />            cant<br />              even use a cell phone.

<p>              'Knowledge' differs from east and west. We consider a <br />person<br />        who<br />          can<br />              read and write as educated, in terms of western <br />education.<br />    But<br />        all<br />              along the generations, only a few people in India knew <br />to<br />    read<br />        and<br />              write but still they had abundant knowledge.

          Is astrology a science?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I agree that there is math and logic underlying astrology. That said <br />interpreting what the chart says is not an easy skill and does <br />require psychic abilities among others. I firmly refuse to believe <br />anyone's future is 'already written' since that contradicts many <br />things including we are resposnible for our own karma and being <br />creatures of free will. Astrology if used wisely can be a good map <br />for our path in life, that is all. </p>
<p>Like I said before since interpretation is a big part of this tool it <br />cannot be called science in a literal sense of the word, it is a <br />personal science or what is true for an individual that only he/she <br />knows, that is all.</p>

<p>  It will take big mails etc to explain various aspects on this <br />  relation, I am not going to go there on this.</p>
<p>  Just a basic word here, I dont want to prolong this however.<br />  Astrology is not psychic work, you need charts and positions of <br />  various planets combined with the time. Earlier days, there were <br />many <br />  calculations (math) based on planets to plan a chart. Today the <br />logic <br />  and numbers are punched into a software and a chart is printed out.<br />  Without having a base line, there is no way you can build from, a <br />plan <br />  / layout etc, that plan is based on math, please check it out. </p>
<p>  There is a lot to go on, but i am gonna keep it simple and leave it <br />at <br />  that.</p>
<p>  This is not philosophy, but more of logic. </p>

<p>Arun, have you read Frijitzov Capra's Tao of Physics - it has great </p>
<p>parellels between eastern mysticism and western science. Yes there is </p>
<p>no resolution to this time honored great debate but assume we can all </p>
<p>agree there are parellels and deep thinking in both areas.</p>

<p>It will take big mails etc to explain various aspects on this <br />relation, I am not going to go there on this.</p>
<p>Just a basic word here, I dont want to prolong this however.<br />Astrology is not psychic work, you need charts and positions of <br />various planets combined with the time. Earlier days, there were many <br />calculations (math) based on planets to plan a chart. Today the logic <br />and numbers are punched into a software and a chart is printed out.<br />Without having a base line, there is no way you can build from, a plan <br />/ layout etc, that plan is based on math, please check it out. </p>
<p>There is a lot to go on, but i am gonna keep it simple and leave it at <br />that.</p>
<p>This is not philosophy, but more of logic. </p>

        <p>Hi Malathi,<br />Yes I have. A long time ago and even then I thought some of the comparisons<br />were a little far-fetched. I never denied that there was deep thinking<br />involved. My original objection was against calling astrology science :)</p>

          Is astrology a science?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Ravi,If you can show evidence of how astrology uses "maths/phy/chem" I would<br />appreciate it. Just stating something doesn't make it into a fact. :)</p>
<p>Also, I think I had better keep quiet now since there is going to be no<br />resolution to this gap in our thinking. Science and philosophy are not quite<br />the same things but they seem to be to most here.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Astrology believes in the concept that the future already exists.<br />  Science tries to invent the future.<br />  We find new things and discover / invent a lot as time moves on using<br />  science (which is a quantified sequence of physics-chemistry-math).<br />  What science discovers in the future, astrology says it exists<br />  already.<br />  Astrology uses math / physics and chemistry (at times) - it tells<br />  what science shows us in the future.<br />  Astrology is not science but an art, greater than any science can<br />  comprehend.<br />  When the Sun sets in the US, it already has risen in Japan - the<br />  future already exists, we just see it as the universe unfolds.<br />  -- Ravi</p>

<p>          I think it should be the other way round. The Eastern science<br />    can<br />      be<br />          comprehended only by the enlightened masters who have<br />      *experienced*<br />        it. Your<br />          next para actually gives an example of it -</p>
<p>        Thanks Sandeep. Maybe both are true. What I intended was the<br />  use<br />    of<br />        science. Without knowing to read and write, atleast numbers,<br />  you<br />      cant<br />        even use a cell phone. But even an ILLITERATE can use the<br />    medicinal<br />        value of Neem or turmeric. Thats what I intended to say.</p>
<p>        'Knowledge' differs from east and west. We consider a person<br />  who<br />    can<br />        read and write as educated, in terms of western education. But<br />  all<br />        along the generations, only a few people in India knew to read<br />  and<br />        write but still they had abundant knowledge. For us education is<br />        knowledge and reading and writing is just literacy.<br />        Am I sounding sarcastic? :)</p>

<p>      Dear Satish,</p>
<p>      LITERATE :: Letter - reading - writing - undeerstanding.</p>
<p>      KNOWLEDGE : Know... by one's self... Or also knowing where to<br />      know ..primarily knowing (knowledge) of source of Knowledge.</p>
<p>      EDUCATING : Uplifting the levels.. ?! (not referred Dictionary)</p>
<p>      And there is WISDOM ... derived from Wiseness.</p>
<p>      The EXPRESSION becomes more clearer... when we think about it.</p>

<p>Talking about Sun set, I remember reading somewhere about the GMT.<br />Astrology is based on Astronomy, the positions of celestial bodies.<br />And Indians were far more advanced in Astronomy too.</p>
<p>Why Greenwich is taken as the point to standardize the international<br />time? All the timezone in the world is represented with reference to<br />GMT. India is GMT + 5.30 hrs. Ie. when its 5.30AM in India, the day<br />starts at Greenwich, ie. 00.00 hrs or 12 midnight.</p>
<p>For Indians, atleast to the Hindus, the start of day is with the<br />sunrise and not midnight. So a 24 hour day is typically from sunrise<br />to the next sunrise. The sun rise in india is between 5 to 6 depending<br />on summer and winter and so the day starts on an average at 5.30 in<br />the morning. I dont remember for what reasons, but thats the exact<br />time the actual day starts on earth. So the day starts at exactly the<br />same time in Greenwich, which is their midnight. The international<br />reference to time is based on the day break in India.</p>
<p>Not sure how far it is true, but sounds logical :) Probably experts<br />can throw more light.</p>

<p>Inner science can only be truly realized by one's own self <br />realization, we have Gurus and masters who have attempted to explain <br />it but again unless one believes in the Guru one is unlikely to <br />understand or comprehend what it is. The difference between inner <br />science and outer/factual science is exactly that - the former is <br />experiential and the latter explainable and proof is understood by <br />others. </p>
<p>Fritjof Capra's Tao of Physics is a great study in this regard. </p>

<p>    Dear Arun,</p>
<p>    Please re-read the first few lines of my previous mail :)</p>
<p>    Everyone is right in their own perspective. There is nothing <br />called<br />    wrong in this prabancham. only the intensity of the right varies.</p>
<p>    As per science, most of the things in the world are classified as<br />    either a living thing or non living thing. Whatever moves, has <br />life -<br />    classified as living things. Whatever doesnt have activity of <br />their<br />    own are classified as non living thing. So movement defines life. <br />Even<br />    a man in coma is considered a living being because there are <br />movements<br />    or activities happening inside the body, though the body doesnt <br />move.<br />    This is the basic science we read in 2nd or 3rd std in schools.</p>
<p>    There is a man and a rock. Obviously the man is living thing and <br />rock<br />    a non living thing. I think everyone accepts this. If the man <br />looks at<br />    the rock all thorough his life, he will conclude that the rock <br />doesnt<br />    change at all. very true.</p>
<p>    Cut the shot and zoom out in to the far away space. As per <br />Einsteins<br />    theory of relativity (as Ravi said belief is the basis of science <br />and<br />    almost all theories are belief's many of which are accepted <br />without<br />    proof) if we send out one among a twin to outer space and if the<br />    person returns after a long time, he will be much younger than his<br />    twin on earth. The biological clock ticks slowly in outer space. <br />if<br />    thats the case of just a human being, a million years on earth is <br />just<br />    a few fractions for the omnipotent god. If we say god is beyond<br />    science, lets again take the twin who traveled in space and say <br />lives<br />    for a million year. For him the same rock on the earth, which <br />never<br />    changes form in a mans lifetime, might seem to change shape due to<br />    various factors, might get eroded, become sand or change form to <br />other<br />    material also. It will be like a movie watched in fast forward, <br />and<br />    the rock changes shapes in a million year.</p>
<p>    So which is correct, the rock never changes shape as per the first<br />    observation or it changes shape as per second observation? Both <br />are<br />    accepted as per science, right.</p>
<p>    Cut the shot and zoom in to the rock, till the molecular level. <br />We see<br />    atoms and inside that protons electrons and neutrons. We know that<br />    these stuff move at random pace and is always in a state of <br />continuous<br />    motion. So does the rock make any movement or not? Internally it <br />does<br />    have motion.</p>
<p>    All the three scenarios I stated above are acceptable as per known<br />    science. So,what shall I conclude? The rock has motion or not? The<br />    rock changes shape or not? both yes and no, depending on which<br />    perspective we look.</p>
<p>    Our ancestors said that the Sun god travels in a chariot with <br />seven<br />    horses but only one wheel. We say it is mythology or just belief. <br />It<br />    also says that arunan is the charioteer of Sun god. Ok, just <br />belief.<br />    Myth. Today we know by science that, light has seven basic <br />colours,<br />    can traverse only one path, meaning will leave only one track and<br />    cannot take two tracks at the same time, the rays of the sun <br />reaches<br />    earth even before the sun rises. Seven colours are seven horses, <br />the<br />    single wheel is the single track traced by sun and Arunan is <br />nothing<br />    but the rays of the sun. The charioteer will reach a point before <br />the<br />    person sitting in the chariot. Isn't there a difference in eastern<br />    science and western science? I would say, eastern science is for<br />    common man, western science is for intellectuals.</p>
<p>    Science have established that all the matter in the universe is <br />made<br />    up on the same basic elements at the microcosm level. I think our<br />    forefathers were brilliant guys, they put this in simple <br />statement -<br />    'Andhathil ullathu pindam, pindathil ullathu andam'. Just because <br />they<br />    didnt prove it with microscope or other scientific methods (we <br />never<br />    know whether they really used some science to arrive at this<br />    conclusion or not) it is not wrong. The same concept has been <br />proved<br />    by science today. Andathilum pindathilum irupathu onre. The <br />universe<br />    is made up of the same basic elements.</p>
<p>    The value of turmeric, neem etc found by advance science in the <br />west<br />    is like drinking water to us. Even an illiterate in a remote <br />village<br />    of India will be using it without even realizing the science <br />behind it.<br />    I am not that knowledgeable and sorry if I have blabbered <br />something,<br />    but all I say is, Indian knowledge cannot be thrown away just <br />because<br />    it cannot be proved or the west doesnt accept it.</p>
<p>    Please re-read my first line of this mail. :)</p>

        <p>(eastern science is for<br />common man, western science is for intellectuals.)</p>
<p>I think it should be the other way round. The Eastern science can be<br />comprehended only by the enlightened masters who have *experienced* it. Your<br />next para actually gives an example of it -</p>
<p>(Science have established that all the matter in the universe is made<br />up on the same basic elements at the microcosm level.)<br />A truly enlightened master actually experiences this oneness with the cosmos<br />and all mater here. Nithyananda explains humorously in his discourse on<br />Shiva Sutras - <a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=V9hHgEeJh7Y" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=V9hHgEeJh7Y">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=V9hHgEeJh7Y</a></p>
<p>There are many more videos where this is elaborated upon. This one explains<br />his personal experience in the oneness<br /><a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc</a></p>
<p>I think present day science does not have the technology to prove the great<br />inner science practiced by our ancient realized masters!</p>

<p>  Please re-read the first few lines of my previous mail :)</p>
<p>  Everyone is right in their own perspective. There is nothing called<br />  wrong in this prabancham. only the intensity of the right varies.</p>
<p>  As per science, most of the things in the world are classified as<br />  either a living thing or non living thing. Whatever moves, has life -<br />  classified as living things. Whatever doesnt have activity of their<br />  own are classified as non living thing. So movement defines life. Even<br />  a man in coma is considered a living being because there are movements<br />  or activities happening inside the body, though the body doesnt move.<br />  This is the basic science we read in 2nd or 3rd std in schools.</p>
<p>  There is a man and a rock. Obviously the man is living thing and rock<br />  a non living thing. I think everyone accepts this. If the man looks at<br />  the rock all thorough his life, he will conclude that the rock doesnt<br />  change at all. very true.</p>
<p>  Cut the shot and zoom out in to the far away space. As per Einsteins<br />  theory of relativity (as Ravi said belief is the basis of science and<br />  almost all theories are belief's many of which are accepted without<br />  proof) if we send out one among a twin to outer space and if the<br />  person returns after a long time, he will be much younger than his<br />  twin on earth. The biological clock ticks slowly in outer space. if<br />  thats the case of just a human being, a million years on earth is just<br />  a few fractions for the omnipotent god. If we say god is beyond<br />  science, lets again take the twin who traveled in space and say lives<br />  for a million year. For him the same rock on the earth, which never<br />  changes form in a mans lifetime, might seem to change shape due to<br />  various factors, might get eroded, become sand or change form to other<br />  material also. It will be like a movie watched in fast forward, and<br />  the rock changes shapes in a million year.</p>
<p>  So which is correct, the rock never changes shape as per the first<br />  observation or it changes shape as per second observation? Both are<br />  accepted as per science, right.</p>
<p>  Cut the shot and zoom in to the rock, till the molecular level. We see<br />  atoms and inside that protons electrons and neutrons. We know that<br />  these stuff move at random pace and is always in a state of continuous<br />  motion. So does the rock make any movement or not? Internally it does<br />  have motion.</p>
<p>  All the three scenarios I stated above are acceptable as per known<br />  science. So,what shall I conclude? The rock has motion or not? The<br />  rock changes shape or not? both yes and no, depending on which<br />  perspective we look.</p>
<p>  Our ancestors said that the Sun god travels in a chariot with seven<br />  horses but only one wheel. We say it is mythology or just belief. It<br />  also says that arunan is the charioteer of Sun god. Ok, just belief.<br />  Myth. Today we know by science that, light has seven basic colours,<br />  can traverse only one path, meaning will leave only one track and<br />  cannot take two tracks at the same time, the rays of the sun reaches<br />  earth even before the sun rises. Seven colours are seven horses, the<br />  single wheel is the single track traced by sun and Arunan is nothing<br />  but the rays of the sun. The charioteer will reach a point before the<br />  person sitting in the chariot. Isn't there a difference in eastern<br />  science and western science? I would say, eastern science is for<br />  common man, western science is for intellectuals.</p>
<p>  Science have established that all the matter in the universe is made<br />  up on the same basic elements at the microcosm level. I think our<br />  forefathers were brilliant guys, they put this in simple statement -<br />  'Andhathil ullathu pindam, pindathil ullathu andam'. Just because they<br />  didnt prove it with microscope or other scientific methods (we never<br />  know whether they really used some science to arrive at this<br />  conclusion or not) it is not wrong. The same concept has been proved<br />  by science today. Andathilum pindathilum irupathu onre. The universe<br />  is made up of the same basic elements.</p>
<p>  The value of turmeric, neem etc found by advance science in the west<br />  is like drinking water to us. Even an illiterate in a remote village<br />  of India will be using it without even realizing the science behind it.<br />  I am not that knowledgeable and sorry if I have blabbered something,<br />  but all I say is, Indian knowledge cannot be thrown away just because<br />  it cannot be proved or the west doesnt accept it.</p>

          Is astrology a science?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Thanks Satish for your thoughts. Again, maybe it didn't come across very<br />clearly..I am not claiming we know all.. am just saying don't call<br />astrology science.. there is a distinct difference here. Yes, sure maybe<br />science is to deal with things that our minds can comprehend but then that<br />is the definition. Under that definition, astrology is NOT science. If you<br />want to change the definition, then you are welcome to do so, but then<br />please mention the definition as you understand it. Moreover, according to<br />me, there is only "science".. no western or eastern "science". There are<br />western or eastern belief systems and that I figure is what everyone else<br />seems to be referring to.</p>

<p>  We have different number systems used in computer field. Binary,<br />  octal, hexa, decimal etc. the same number is depicted in different<br />  formats in different number system.

On the other hand, if the species with 2<br />  fingers say 1000, we will by default assume its one thousand,unless we<br />  understand that its binary and it represents 8 to them. We know how to<br />  convert between these numbers and hence we accept them. what if there<br />  is a numeric system based on say 15. Till we find the conversion<br />  process, we will says its nonsense or rather belief.</p>
<p>  The western thought process accepts only things which are<br />  comprehensible to Human minds. If anything is incomprehensible we try<br />  to neglect it saying its nonsense.</p>
<p>  Humans defined God in Human form, because we can only relate to<br />  ourselves and see things only in our perspective. If the buffaloes are<br />  to conceive a god, it will surely conceive god in a form of buffalo.<br />  If it sees the god form of Humans, it will laugh and say humans are<br />  uncultured and is not civilized enough. This is the flaw we find with<br />  most of the religions. Our ancestors knew to think in different plane<br />  of reference and could accept god in buffalo form or human form where<br />  as other religions did not or rather cannot because of the plane of<br />  reference we think in. In the outer space, all our beliefs or even<br />  facts goes for a toss. Person in the outer space will say, north and<br />  south and east and west is only your belief and it has no proof,<br />  untill he comes down to earth and see and understand what directions mean.</p>
<p>  Maybe,it seems i am digressing from the topic, but I am just saying<br />  that just that we cant prove or disprove something, we should not come<br />  to conclusion. A belief system will surely come to an end at some<br />  point, but cannot prolong for so long a time. If we have lost the<br />  science behind it, its our fault not astrology's fault.</p>
<p>  Recently I watched a move 'Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy'. Didnt had<br />  the patience to read the book, hence saw the movie. Hilarious and<br />  absolute nonsense, atleast at the outset.

Yes the little Mice. When the human say, its humans who<br />  does experiment with mice, the answer is, thats what the mice made you<br />  to think. ithu eppadi iruku...</p>
<p>  I am reading an ebook called 'God's Debris' by Scott Adams. Really a<br />  good one, trying to answer things which are similar to our Indian<br />  thought process. It challenges the known beliefs of God but trying to<br />  say that what we think about god generally is not true, but its more<br />  than that. Which is very much the Hindu way of thinking.

A postulate by itself is neither <br />true<br />    or<br />        false till proved or disproved. If not proved right, does not<br />        automatically mean that it is false. We are so much exposed <br />and<br />        conditioned by western logic, that we treat all other systems<br />    which do<br />        not fall into western logic as false. Indian logic 'tarka', is<br />    little<br />        known today.</p>
<p>        In fact even in modern science, many basic concepts - parallel<br />    lines,<br />        infinity, sub-atomic particles, universe, speed of light etc. <br />or<br />    your<br />        field -genetics- have lots of postulates and assumptions.</p>
<p>        We all know - effect of moon on tides, gravity on earth <br />phenomena,<br />        electromagnetic radiation on human body and mind, beneficial<br />    effects of<br />        sound (music) and light on our health and temperament - well <br />more<br />    can be<br />        added. There is no fundamental flaw in saying that planets can<br />    control<br />        our lives to some extent; at least as one of the several <br />factors<br />        influencing our behaviour and action. We believe that smoking<br />    causes<br />        lung cancer, but so far have not accepted that cell phones can<br />    cause<br />        brain cancer. And we are bombarded with all kinds of benign (?<br />)<br />    and<br />        malefic radiation from all corners of the universe. We know <br />when<br />    one is<br />        strick by lightning, but not when one is exposed dangerous <br />dose of<br />        cosmic rays.</p>
<p>        Belief or disbelief is a personal matter. But throwing away a <br />two<br />        thousand year old knowledge preserved and transmitted by our<br />    ancestors<br />        is not a wise idea. We must learn to look through Indian eyes <br />and<br />    use<br />        indian logic to understand.</p>
<p>        Recently I read somewhere that universe si -1% solid, 3% gas <br />and<br />    the<br />        remaining 96% - empty or energy? How do I accept this?</p>

To me, science is the modern definition: A testable<br />        hypothesis<br />          which can be proven or disproven by experiments. Astrology <br />is<br />    probably<br />        based<br />          on statistics.. but consider this, the statistics (at least <br />for<br />    our<br />        Hindu<br />          astrology) if ever they were taken, are rather old and the<br />    sample size<br />        is<br />          also different. Has anybody done a fresh study of this and<br />    updated<br />        their<br />          predictions or are we still using 3000 year old charts.</p>
<p>          Regardless, statistics is just a way to obtain some <br />relevance<br />    from a<br />        given<br />          data and can definitely not be said to be accurate in all<br />    instances. I<br />        am<br />          still waiting for someone to prove to me that "astrology is<br />    science".<br />        Or<br />          about how planets affect our futures. Also, correlations <br />(which<br />    is<br />        what in<br />          my opinion astrology is, based on statistics) does not <br />signify<br />    cause<br />        and<br />          effect.It might happen that everytime I go to a temple it <br />rains;         however<br />          that doesn't imply that rain causes my temple visits or <br />vice-<br />    versa.</p>
<p>          I do agree wholeheartedly about "taking responsibility for<br />    one's own<br />          actions" but fail to see how a "belief in reincarnation" can<br />    help in<br />        any<br />          way.</p>

<p>I am not saying that everything we know in science is the absolute truth..<br />there may very well be future discoveries which might overturn what be think<br />is the truth now.. however, it is going to be based on testable hypothesis..<br />and when someone shows that there is evidence to the contrary, the scientist<br />will acknowledge it.. unlike "belief-based" systems where evidence to the<br />contrary is usually rejected.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>A little late perhaps but my two cents on this one - there are <br />personal truths and factual truths, I like to use the word truths <br />instead of science as science is a combination of various, not <br />necessarily always proven :) If you love someone that is a personal <br />truth, meaning normally only the two people involved know it in their <br />hearts that it is true, others only have opinions. The sun rises in <br />the east is a factual truth, everybody knows it the same and there <br />are no arguments.</p>
<p>Astrology and to some extent even spiritual experiences are personal <br />truths, only persons involved know whether or not it is 'true' for <br />them. I personally do not believe much in predictive astrology or <br />people telling you what you can/will be ten years from now, human <br />beings are creatures of free will and there is no predicting how <br />human will can work. But I do believe astrology is very capable of <br />saying the climate around one's life, when you are going to strike it <br />big and when times are going to be low. Astrology if used rightly can <br />also very accurately do a psycho-profile - one's talents, strengths, <br />weaknesses and direction in life. Again it is not something that is <br />for the cynical or those looking for 'proof', it works if you beleive <br />it will and only life can be evidence of that.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Arun,</p>
<p>  If statistics, psychology and economics can be called sciences then<br />  astrology can also be called a science. I 'believe' the evidence can<br />  be statistically proven. Just because we don't know how it works, it<br />  should not mean it does not work.</p>
<p>  As you will be aware, there are numerous websites dedicated to<br />  astrology and defend it vehemently. A couple are below:</p>
<p>  <a href="http://astrology.uk70.com/info/astrology5.htm" title="http://astrology.uk70.com/info/astrology5.htm">http://astrology.uk70.com/info/astrology5.htm</a><br />  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/119299.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/119299.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/119299.stm</a></p>
<p>  However, astrology is now highly commercialised and I certainly don't<br />  trust any astrologers.</p>
<p>  Having said that, I do believe that if you live your life by taking<br />  responsibility for all your actions and believe in re-incarnation<br />  then there is no need for astrology.</p>

<p>       What do you mean by "where did this arise from"? It is a<br />  completely<br />       biological process. And then the growth of the body is based on<br />  the<br />       nutrients it receives.. so again conservation of mass and energy.</p>
<p>      What I mean is, science as we are generally familiar with, does<br />  not have a<br />      proper explanation on the origin of any mass. We are only working<br />  with a few<br />      proposed theories. This is vastly different from conducting a<br />  regular<br />      scientific experiment to repeat it and get the exact results.<br />  There are just<br />      too many factors around that we still have absolutely no clue of.<br />  So we are<br />      only relying on what is currently established by (modern) science<br />  and we<br />      most definitely can not accept that as the absolute proof for<br />  everything<br />      that happens in life. There are vast realms of unproven content<br />  that defy<br />      (so called) scientific proof. For this biological process as you<br />  have<br />      outlined, there must surely be a bio-memory. Even if you may call<br />  it<br />      (simplistically) as a genetic code, did it just happen? Is there<br />  any<br />      accountable scientific proof of how that happened yet?</p>
