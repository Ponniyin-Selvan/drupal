<p>Dear Venkat &amp; Gokul, </p>
<p>Undoubtedly this is a very interesting thread.</p>
<p>Characterising UTHAMA should have haunted Kalki and VERY <br />BRILLIANTLY he split the characterisation into TWO and fascinated <br />all of us.</p>
<p>While Characterising, Sembian Madevi also should have posed <br />challenges to Kalki.</p>
<p>Here let us keep certain things in mind :</p>
<p>When Udayaalur Pallippadai details are discussed among us NOW, most <br />of the discussions zero on Dr. Thangamani (Princi / Thiruvayaru <br />Arts - 10 yrs back).. Some go back to Kudanthai Sethuraman (Raman &amp; <br />Raman Bus) active in 1975 - 87 or so.  </p>
<p>But the British (<acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym ) have published the details as early in 1927-<br />28. </acronym></p>
<p>Means even though published 60 yrs back, no one took notice of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's <br />pallipadai-speculated temple till 1975 / 85!</acronym></p>
<p>Same way, Sastri / Pandarathar details, based on Hultzch findings, <br />who concentrated on releasing <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  Volumes - first of which initially <br />dealt with Kanchi Kailasanathar temple, Big temple, Anbil - <br />thiruvalangadu copper plates etc., only.</acronym></p>
<p>Kalki relied on these details alone for his work. Udayarkudi <br />finding was nearer and newer by about 25 years when he wrote <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  in <br />1950.</acronym></p>
<p>Inscriptions-reading in Thirunallam @ Konerirajapuram and other <br />prominent temples were taken up by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  later and direct access to <br />inscriptions would have been difficult at such an early stage.</acronym></p>
<p>Following inputs would have helped Kalki in characterisations:</p>
<p>KANDRADITHAR - Thiruvisaippa - God fearing King relinquishing Power.<br />SEMBIANMADEVI - converting brick structures to Katrali - Devoted <br />Saivite - leading saintly life, committing more to religion than <br />committing sati and wasting life.<br />UTHAMA 1 - Peaceful Pious King<br />UTHAMA 2 - Counter balance<br />ARUMOZHI - Giving away Mahudam - Thiruvalangadu Copper plates<br />RAVIDASAN &amp; CO.. - Udayarkudi<br />Sundara - Anirudh - Anbil CP; Sundara - Periapazhuvettarayar - Pazhuvur inscriptions.<br />Arumozhi - Kundavai nexus - Big temple inscriptions.</p>
<p>Now we have more materials in hand - with State Archlgy working on <br />more than 10000 inscriptions last year alone.</p>
<p>That is how picturisation gets closer and clearer.</p>
<p>After Kandraditha though Sundara occupied Power, his declaring <br />Aditha Karikala as Heir-apparent should have attracted criticisms <br />and Uthama should have got help from certain quarters which made him <br />occupy the position. But his political free-will wings would have <br />been clipped. <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  could have ultilised the period for stabilising.  </p>
<p>After coming to power, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  could have methodically removed the <br />clips on the political free-will wings.. realising UTHAMA's JUST and <br />also helplessness.</acronym></p>
<p>In Karanthai @ Karunthattankudi (near Thanjai) inscriptions, <br />Rajendra calls himself UTHAMA !  </p>
<p>As a matter of fact there are 3 similarities between Rajendra and <br />UTHAMA s/o Sembianmadevi !</p>
<p>PARAKESARI UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />MADURANTHAKAN UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />UTHAMA UTHAMA RAJENDRA</p>
<p>Let us try to put History by adding new inputs to available <br />informations first.</p>
<p>regards/ sps</p>

<p>I have read that Kalki kept extensive hand notes and detailed breakup of<br />chapters with references. It will be very useful if such information is<br />still available and accessible. Even though Kalki passed away after<br />writing a few chapters of Amaradhara, his daughter was able to complete<br />the novel with the help of the notes left by him. He also visited the<br />places (including Srilanka) he used in his novels. He might have<br />received additional inputs - may be even from the local people.</p>
<p>It is not a bad idea to collate all the reference material used by<br />Kalki, Balakumaran, Akilan and others. This may be stored in the Files<br />section for use by members.</p>
<p>Study of Indology has been well supported and funded by many<br />universities. Tamil is not so lucky. Millions of man and scholar hours<br />are needed to collect hard evidence, study existing evidence and propose<br />viable theories.</p>
<p>A loose remark about drunk and gold hungry poets has generated lot of<br />hot air, as the recently reported speech by Vairamuthu about inebriated<br />poets. (Kalki magazine was a lead player in this episode) We can now<br />move on.</p>

<p>    Dear Venkat &amp; Gokul,</p>
<p>    Undoubtedly this is a very interesting thread.</p>
<p>    Characterising UTHAMA should have haunted Kalki and VERY<br />    BRILLIANTLY he split the characterisation into TWO and fascinated<br />    all of us.</p>
<p>    While Characterising, Sembian Madevi also should have posed<br />    challenges to Kalki.</p>
<p>    Here let us keep certain things in mind :</p>
<p>    When Udayaalur Pallippadai details are discussed among us NOW, most<br />    of the discussions zero on Dr. Thangamani (Princi / Thiruvayaru<br />    Arts - 10 yrs back).. Some go back to Kudanthai Sethuraman (Raman<br />  &amp;     Raman Bus) active in 1975 - 87 or so.</p>
<p>    But the British (ASI) have published the details as early in 1927-<br />    28.</p>
<p>    Means even though published 60 yrs back, no one took notice of<br />  RRC's<br />    pallipadai-speculat ed temple till 1975 / 85!</p>
<p>    Same way, Sastri / Pandarathar details, based on Hultzch findings,<br />    who concentrated on releasing ASI Volumes - first of which<br />  initially<br />    dealt with Kanchi Kailasanathar temple, Big temple, Anbil -<br />    thiruvalangadu copper plates etc., only.</p>
<p>    Kalki relied on these details alone for his work. Udayarkudi<br />    finding was nearer and newer by about 25 years when he wrote PS in<br />    1950.</p>
<p>    Inscriptions- reading in Thirunallam @ Konerirajapuram and other<br />    prominent temples were taken up by ASI later and direct access to<br />    inscriptions would have been difficult at such an early stage.</p>
<p>    Following inputs would have helped Kalki in characterisations:</p>
<p>    KANDRADITHAR - Thiruvisaippa - God fearing King relinquishing Power.<br />    SEMBIANMADEVI - converting brick structures to Katrali - Devoted<br />    Saivite - leading saintly life, committing more to religion than<br />    committing sati and wasting life.<br />    UTHAMA 1 - Peaceful Pious King<br />    UTHAMA 2 - Counter balance<br />    ARUMOZHI - Giving away Mahudam - Thiruvalangadu Copper plates<br />    RAVIDASAN &amp; CO.. - Udayarkudi<br />    Sundara - Anirudh - Anbil CP;     Sundara - Periapazhuvettaraya r - Pazhuvur inscriptions.<br />    Arumozhi - Kundavai nexus - Big temple inscriptions.</p>
<p>    Now we have more materials in hand - with State Archlgy working on<br />    more than 10000 inscriptions last year alone.</p>
<p>    That is how picturisation gets closer and clearer.</p>
<p>    After Kandraditha though Sundara occupied Power, his declaring<br />    Aditha Karikala as Heir-apparent should have attracted criticisms<br />    and Uthama should have got help from certain quarters which made<br />  him<br />    occupy the position. But his political free-will wings would have<br />    been clipped. RRC could have ultilised the period for<br />  stabilising.</p>
<p>    After coming to power, RRC could have methodically removed the<br />    clips on the political free-will wings.. realising UTHAMA's JUST<br />  and<br />    also helplessness.</p>
<p>    In Karanthai @ Karunthattankudi (near Thanjai) inscriptions,<br />    Rajendra calls himself UTHAMA !</p>
<p>    As a matter of fact there are 3 similarities between Rajendra and<br />    UTHAMA s/o Sembianmadevi !</p>
<p>    PARAKESARI UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />    MADURANTHAKAN UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />    UTHAMA UTHAMA RAJENDRA</p>
<p>    Let us try to put History by adding new inputs to available<br />    informations first.</p>

<p>the clues to the thoughts in a writer's mind come often from the <br />naming of the charecters.<br />kalki had a freedom in only a few.</p>
<p>amuthan, nanthini, pungkuzhali,mandakini, kandamaran sambuvarayan the <br />rest were historical charecters thrust on him</p>
<p>kanda suriya sambuvarayan was a chieftan with temple building of <br />thiruvakkarai. name comes closest to kandamaran.<br />pungkuzhali is the name of a goddess in a temple close to manalmedu<br />amuthan and uthama must have been linked.<br />nandini's meaning we can reach but we need kalki's notes.</p>

<p>    Dear Venkat &amp; Gokul, </p>
<p>    Undoubtedly this is a very interesting thread.</p>
<p>    Characterising UTHAMA should have haunted Kalki and VERY <br />    BRILLIANTLY he split the characterisation into TWO and fascinated <br />    all of us.</p>
<p>    While Characterising, Sembian Madevi also should have posed <br />    challenges to Kalki.</p>
<p>    Here let us keep certain things in mind :</p>
<p>    When Udayaalur Pallippadai details are discussed among us NOW, <br />most <br />    of the discussions zero on Dr. Thangamani (Princi / Thiruvayaru <br />    Arts - 10 yrs back).. Some go back to Kudanthai Sethuraman <br />(Raman <br />  &amp; <br />    Raman Bus) active in 1975 - 87 or so.  </p>
<p>    But the British (ASI) have published the details as early in 1927-<br />    28. </p>
<p>    Means even though published 60 yrs back, no one took notice of <br />  RRC's <br />    pallipadai-speculated temple till 1975 / 85!</p>
<p>    Same way, Sastri / Pandarathar details, based on Hultzch <br />findings, <br />    who concentrated on releasing ASI Volumes - first of which <br />  initially <br />    dealt with Kanchi Kailasanathar temple, Big temple, Anbil - <br />    thiruvalangadu copper plates etc., only.</p>
<p>    Kalki relied on these details alone for his work. Udayarkudi <br />    finding was nearer and newer by about 25 years when he wrote PS <br />in <br />    1950.</p>
<p>    Inscriptions-reading in Thirunallam @ Konerirajapuram and other <br />    prominent temples were taken up by ASI later and direct access to <br />    inscriptions would have been difficult at such an early stage.</p>
<p>    Following inputs would have helped Kalki in characterisations:</p>
<p>    KANDRADITHAR - Thiruvisaippa - God fearing King relinquishing <br />Power.<br />    SEMBIANMADEVI - converting brick structures to Katrali - Devoted <br />    Saivite - leading saintly life, committing more to religion than <br />    committing sati and wasting life.<br />    UTHAMA 1 - Peaceful Pious King<br />    UTHAMA 2 - Counter balance<br />    ARUMOZHI - Giving away Mahudam - Thiruvalangadu Copper plates<br />    RAVIDASAN &amp; CO.. - Udayarkudi<br />    Sundara - Anirudh - Anbil CP;     Sundara - Periapazhuvettarayar - Pazhuvur inscriptions.<br />    Arumozhi - Kundavai nexus - Big temple inscriptions.</p>
<p>    Now we have more materials in hand - with State Archlgy working <br />on <br />    more than 10000 inscriptions last year alone.</p>
<p>    That is how picturisation gets closer and clearer.</p>
<p>    After Kandraditha though Sundara occupied Power, his declaring <br />    Aditha Karikala as Heir-apparent should have attracted criticisms <br />    and Uthama should have got help from certain quarters which made <br />  him <br />    occupy the position. But his political free-will wings would <br />have <br />    been clipped. RRC could have ultilised the period for <br />  stabilising.  </p>
<p>    After coming to power, RRC could have methodically removed the <br />    clips on the political free-will wings.. realising UTHAMA's JUST <br />  and <br />    also helplessness.</p>
<p>    In Karanthai @ Karunthattankudi (near Thanjai) inscriptions, <br />    Rajendra calls himself UTHAMA !  </p>
<p>    As a matter of fact there are 3 similarities between Rajendra and <br />    UTHAMA s/o Sembianmadevi !</p>
<p>    PARAKESARI UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />    MADURANTHAKAN UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />    UTHAMA UTHAMA RAJENDRA</p>

        <p>In ch.22 vol 2, Senthan Amudan is met by Kundavai and Vanati in th<br />eprison. He does not want to be released when Kundavai offers to do so; the reason he offers -" Please don't. The man in the next cell is<br />willing to reveal a secret - where the crown and jwellery of the Pandya<br />king is hidden. Please keep me here till I learn this secret."</p>
<p>Now, Karuthiruman, the prisoner, who knew about the switched children,<br />does not talk about the second secret. Either he did not reveal all his<br />cards, or did not know that the other prisoner was royal. Or Kalki had<br />not made up his mind about Sendan Amuthan.</p>

<p>  His son rajendran recollects: "...One day kalki was doing <br />sirasaasana<br />  and suddenly he got up and said - why not make senthan a raaja?"</p>
<p>  Thus the decision to make uttama a pious man was a sudden decision <br />of<br />  kalki. If you analyse the events leading to uttama's accession they<br />  look slightly confusing. kalki was still powerful enough to convince<br />  the readers and nobody made big noise. </p>

<blockquote><p>  I have read that Kalki kept extensive hand notes and detailed <br />breakup of<br />  chapters with references. It will be very useful if such <br />information is<br />  still available and accessible. Even though Kalki passed away after<br />  writing a few chapters of Amaradhara, his daughter was able to <br />complete<br />  the novel with the help of the notes left by him. He also visited <br />the<br />  places (including Srilanka) he used in his novels. He might have<br />  received additional inputs - may be even from the local people.</p>
<p>  It is not a bad idea to collate all the reference material used by<br />  Kalki, Balakumaran, Akilan and others. This may be stored in the <br />Files<br />  section for use by members.</p>
<p>  Study of Indology has been well supported and funded by many<br />  universities. Tamil is not so lucky. Millions of man and scholar <br />hours<br />  are needed to collect hard evidence, study existing evidence and <br />propose<br />  viable theories.</p>
<p>  A loose remark about drunk and gold hungry poets has generated lot <br />of<br />  hot air, as the recently reported speech by Vairamuthu about <br />inebriated<br />  poets. (Kalki magazine was a lead player in this episode) We can now<br />  move on.</p>

<p>      Dear Venkat &amp; Gokul,</p>
<p>      Undoubtedly this is a very interesting thread.</p>
<p>      Characterising UTHAMA should have haunted Kalki and VERY<br />      BRILLIANTLY he split the characterisation into TWO and <br />fascinated<br />      all of us.</p>
<p>      While Characterising, Sembian Madevi also should have posed<br />      challenges to Kalki.</p>
<p>      Here let us keep certain things in mind :</p>
<p>      When Udayaalur Pallippadai details are discussed among us NOW, <br />most<br />      of the discussions zero on Dr. Thangamani (Princi / Thiruvayaru<br />      Arts - 10 yrs back).. Some go back to Kudanthai Sethuraman <br />(Raman<br />    &amp;       Raman Bus) active in 1975 - 87 or so.</p>
<p>      But the British (ASI) have published the details as early in <br />1927-<br />      28.</p>
<p>      Means even though published 60 yrs back, no one took notice of<br />    RRC's<br />      pallipadai-speculated temple till 1975 / 85!</p>
<p>      Same way, Sastri / Pandarathar details, based on Hultzch <br />findings,<br />      who concentrated on releasing ASI Volumes - first of which<br />    initially<br />      dealt with Kanchi Kailasanathar temple, Big temple, Anbil -<br />      thiruvalangadu copper plates etc., only.</p>
<p>      Kalki relied on these details alone for his work. Udayarkudi<br />      finding was nearer and newer by about 25 years when he wrote PS <br />in<br />      1950.</p>
<p>      Inscriptions-reading in Thirunallam @ Konerirajapuram and other<br />      prominent temples were taken up by ASI later and direct access <br />to<br />      inscriptions would have been difficult at such an early stage.</p>
<p>      Following inputs would have helped Kalki in characterisations:</p>
<p>      KANDRADITHAR - Thiruvisaippa - God fearing King relinquishing <br />Power.<br />      SEMBIANMADEVI - converting brick structures to Katrali - Devoted<br />      Saivite - leading saintly life, committing more to religion than<br />      committing sati and wasting life.<br />      UTHAMA 1 - Peaceful Pious King<br />      UTHAMA 2 - Counter balance<br />      ARUMOZHI - Giving away Mahudam - Thiruvalangadu Copper plates<br />      RAVIDASAN &amp; CO.. - Udayarkudi<br />      Sundara - Anirudh - Anbil CP;       Sundara - Periapazhuvettarayar - Pazhuvur inscriptions.<br />      Arumozhi - Kundavai nexus - Big temple inscriptions.</p>
<p>      Now we have more materials in hand - with State Archlgy working <br />on<br />      more than 10000 inscriptions last year alone.</p>
<p>      That is how picturisation gets closer and clearer.</p>
<p>      After Kandraditha though Sundara occupied Power, his declaring<br />      Aditha Karikala as Heir-apparent should have attracted <br />criticisms<br />      and Uthama should have got help from certain quarters which made<br />    him<br />      occupy the position. But his political free-will wings would <br />have<br />      been clipped. RRC could have ultilised the period for<br />    stabilising.</p>
<p>      After coming to power, RRC could have methodically removed the<br />      clips on the political free-will wings.. realising UTHAMA's JUST<br />    and<br />      also helplessness.</p>
<p>      In Karanthai @ Karunthattankudi (near Thanjai) inscriptions,<br />      Rajendra calls himself UTHAMA !</p>
<p>      As a matter of fact there are 3 similarities between Rajendra <br />and<br />      UTHAMA s/o Sembianmadevi !</p>
<p>      PARAKESARI UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />      MADURANTHAKAN UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />      UTHAMA UTHAMA RAJENDRA</p>
<p>      Let us try to put History by adding new inputs to available<br />      informations first.</p>

<p>Dear venkat</p>
<p>Dr Poovannan's Phd thesis "Kalkiyin varalaatru naavalgal - oru aivu"<br />provides rare gilmpses on how he wrote the novel. HE REFERRED ALL THE<br />NOTES OF KALKI WITH THE ACTUAL HISTORY BOOKS HE USED.</p>
<p>In all probability it could have happened like this:</p>
<p>- Kalki first read Cholas in which <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  straight away accused uttama <br />for aditya's murder. This left lasting impression in kalki's mind and<br />hence the character old mathuranthakan. At this point of time he had<br />no intention of making senthan a major character. If you read the<br />initial chapters and the introduction of senthan amudhan you have no<br />clue about what he is going to become..</acronym></p>
<p>- The Book "Pirkaalach chozhar sariththiram" came out as the novel was<br />in progress. This book was used page by page by kalki. Here sadasiva<br />pandarathar arguued that <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  was wrong in accusing uttama. Kalki<br />should have been in a fix. But he was a powerful writer who could<br />twist things in a convincing manner</acronym></p>
<p>His son rajendran recollects: "...One day kalki was doing sirasaasana<br />and suddenly he got up and said - why not make senthan a raaja?"</p>
<p>Thus the decision to make uttama a pious man was a sudden decision of<br />kalki. If you analyse the events leading to uttama's accession they<br />look slightly confusing. kalki was still powerful enough to convince<br />the readers and nobody made big noise. </p>
<p>THAT was the power of kalki's pen.</p>

        <p>I have read that Kalki kept extensive hand notes and detailed breakup of<br />chapters with references. It will be very useful if such information is<br />still available and accessible. Even though Kalki passed away after<br />writing a few chapters of Amaradhara, his daughter was able to complete<br />the novel with the help of the notes left by him. He also visited the<br />places (including Srilanka) he used in his novels. He might have<br />received additional inputs - may be even from the local people.</p>
<p>It is not a bad idea to collate all the reference material used by<br />Kalki, Balakumaran, Akilan and others. This may be stored in the Files<br />section for use by members.</p>
<p>Study of Indology has been well supported and funded by many<br />universities. Tamil is not so lucky. Millions of man and scholar hours<br />are needed to collect hard evidence, study existing evidence and propose<br />viable theories.</p>
<p>A loose remark about drunk and gold hungry poets has generated lot of<br />hot air, as the recently reported speech by Vairamuthu about inebriated<br />poets. (Kalki magazine was a lead player in this episode) We can now<br />move on.</p>

<p>    Dear Venkat &amp; Gokul,</p>
<p>    Undoubtedly this is a very interesting thread.</p>
<p>    Characterising UTHAMA should have haunted Kalki and VERY<br />    BRILLIANTLY he split the characterisation into TWO and fascinated<br />    all of us.</p>
<p>    While Characterising, Sembian Madevi also should have posed<br />    challenges to Kalki.</p>
<p>    Here let us keep certain things in mind :</p>
<p>    When Udayaalur Pallippadai details are discussed among us NOW, most<br />    of the discussions zero on Dr. Thangamani (Princi / Thiruvayaru<br />    Arts - 10 yrs back).. Some go back to Kudanthai Sethuraman (Raman<br />  &amp;     Raman Bus) active in 1975 - 87 or so.</p>
<p>    But the British (ASI) have published the details as early in 1927-<br />    28.</p>
<p>    Means even though published 60 yrs back, no one took notice of<br />  RRC's<br />    pallipadai-speculated temple till 1975 / 85!</p>
<p>    Same way, Sastri / Pandarathar details, based on Hultzch findings,<br />    who concentrated on releasing ASI Volumes - first of which<br />  initially<br />    dealt with Kanchi Kailasanathar temple, Big temple, Anbil -<br />    thiruvalangadu copper plates etc., only.</p>
<p>    Kalki relied on these details alone for his work. Udayarkudi<br />    finding was nearer and newer by about 25 years when he wrote PS in<br />    1950.</p>
<p>    Inscriptions-reading in Thirunallam @ Konerirajapuram and other<br />    prominent temples were taken up by ASI later and direct access to<br />    inscriptions would have been difficult at such an early stage.</p>
<p>    Following inputs would have helped Kalki in characterisations:</p>
<p>    KANDRADITHAR - Thiruvisaippa - God fearing King relinquishing Power.<br />    SEMBIANMADEVI - converting brick structures to Katrali - Devoted<br />    Saivite - leading saintly life, committing more to religion than<br />    committing sati and wasting life.<br />    UTHAMA 1 - Peaceful Pious King<br />    UTHAMA 2 - Counter balance<br />    ARUMOZHI - Giving away Mahudam - Thiruvalangadu Copper plates<br />    RAVIDASAN &amp; CO.. - Udayarkudi<br />    Sundara - Anirudh - Anbil CP;     Sundara - Periapazhuvettarayar - Pazhuvur inscriptions.<br />    Arumozhi - Kundavai nexus - Big temple inscriptions.</p>
<p>    Now we have more materials in hand - with State Archlgy working on<br />    more than 10000 inscriptions last year alone.</p>
<p>    That is how picturisation gets closer and clearer.</p>
<p>    After Kandraditha though Sundara occupied Power, his declaring<br />    Aditha Karikala as Heir-apparent should have attracted criticisms<br />    and Uthama should have got help from certain quarters which made<br />  him<br />    occupy the position. But his political free-will wings would have<br />    been clipped. RRC could have ultilised the period for<br />  stabilising.</p>
<p>    After coming to power, RRC could have methodically removed the<br />    clips on the political free-will wings.. realising UTHAMA's JUST<br />  and<br />    also helplessness.</p>
<p>    In Karanthai @ Karunthattankudi (near Thanjai) inscriptions,<br />    Rajendra calls himself UTHAMA !</p>
<p>    As a matter of fact there are 3 similarities between Rajendra and<br />    UTHAMA s/o Sembianmadevi !</p>
<p>    PARAKESARI UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />    MADURANTHAKAN UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />    UTHAMA UTHAMA RAJENDRA</p>
<p>    Let us try to put History by adding new inputs to available<br />    informations first.</p>

        <p>-Hi<br />chola geneology gets tougher and tougher to decipher by the day and <br />varalaaru.com is talking about pazhuvur geneology.</p>
<p>the switching of the royal heir was a concept that dumas mastered. <br />and kalki was an avid reader of dumas. this along with the info of <br />sembian madevi honouring an image of amarabhujangan(even if it was <br />somebody different)must have triggered off the episode in his mind.<br />but one thing. U T H A MA WHEN ANAGRAMMED( MIXED ) reads AMUTHA.<br />so right from the start he had decided on the flower boy becomes the <br />king story line.</p>

<p>  Dear Venkat &amp; Gokul, </p>
<p>  Undoubtedly this is a very interesting thread.</p>
<p>  Characterising UTHAMA should have haunted Kalki and VERY <br />  BRILLIANTLY he split the characterisation into TWO and fascinated <br />  all of us.</p>
<p>  While Characterising, Sembian Madevi also should have posed <br />  challenges to Kalki.</p>
<p>  Here let us keep certain things in mind :</p>
<p>  When Udayaalur Pallippadai details are discussed among us NOW, most <br />  of the discussions zero on Dr. Thangamani (Princi / Thiruvayaru <br />  Arts - 10 yrs back).. Some go back to Kudanthai Sethuraman (Raman <br />&amp; <br />  Raman Bus) active in 1975 - 87 or so.  </p>
<p>  But the British (ASI) have published the details as early in 1927-<br />  28. </p>
<p>  Means even though published 60 yrs back, no one took notice of <br />RRC's <br />  pallipadai-speculated temple till 1975 / 85!</p>
<p>  Same way, Sastri / Pandarathar details, based on Hultzch findings, <br />  who concentrated on releasing ASI Volumes - first of which <br />initially <br />  dealt with Kanchi Kailasanathar temple, Big temple, Anbil - <br />  thiruvalangadu copper plates etc., only.</p>
<p>  Kalki relied on these details alone for his work. Udayarkudi <br />  finding was nearer and newer by about 25 years when he wrote PS in <br />  1950.</p>
<p>  Inscriptions-reading in Thirunallam @ Konerirajapuram and other <br />  prominent temples were taken up by ASI later and direct access to <br />  inscriptions would have been difficult at such an early stage.</p>
<p>  Following inputs would have helped Kalki in characterisations:</p>
<p>  KANDRADITHAR - Thiruvisaippa - God fearing King relinquishing Power.<br />  SEMBIANMADEVI - converting brick structures to Katrali - Devoted <br />  Saivite - leading saintly life, committing more to religion than <br />  committing sati and wasting life.<br />  UTHAMA 1 - Peaceful Pious King<br />  UTHAMA 2 - Counter balance<br />  ARUMOZHI - Giving away Mahudam - Thiruvalangadu Copper plates<br />  RAVIDASAN &amp; CO.. - Udayarkudi<br />  Sundara - Anirudh - Anbil CP;   Sundara - Periapazhuvettarayar - Pazhuvur inscriptions.<br />  Arumozhi - Kundavai nexus - Big temple inscriptions.</p>
<p>  Now we have more materials in hand - with State Archlgy working on <br />  more than 10000 inscriptions last year alone.</p>
<p>  That is how picturisation gets closer and clearer.</p>
<p>  After Kandraditha though Sundara occupied Power, his declaring <br />  Aditha Karikala as Heir-apparent should have attracted criticisms <br />  and Uthama should have got help from certain quarters which made <br />him <br />  occupy the position. But his political free-will wings would have <br />  been clipped. RRC could have ultilised the period for <br />stabilising.  </p>
<p>  After coming to power, RRC could have methodically removed the <br />  clips on the political free-will wings.. realising UTHAMA's JUST <br />and <br />  also helplessness.</p>
<p>  In Karanthai @ Karunthattankudi (near Thanjai) inscriptions, <br />  Rajendra calls himself UTHAMA !  </p>
<p>  As a matter of fact there are 3 similarities between Rajendra and <br />  UTHAMA s/o Sembianmadevi !</p>
<p>  PARAKESARI UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />  MADURANTHAKAN UTHAMA RAJENDRA<br />  UTHAMA UTHAMA RAJENDRA</p>
<p>  Let us try to put History by adding new inputs to available <br />  informations first.</p>
<p>  regards/ sps</p>
