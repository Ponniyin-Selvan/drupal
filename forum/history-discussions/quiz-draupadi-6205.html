          Quiz on Draupadi        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>continuing on these interesting lines, I saw a play (I forgot written by<br />who.. possibly a Kannada writer) .. the play was in English and was about<br />Gandhari.. contrary to popular belief that Gandhari tied the bandage around<br />her eyes to share her husband's blindness, in the play, Gandhari ties the<br />cloth around her eyes cos she is disgusted at her parents and brother for<br />making her marry a blind king... she doesn't even want to look at him if she<br />is being forced into it.. was quite an interesting take on things.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Pavithra, to remember, Draupadi was not the only woman with<br />  multiple husbands in the Mahabharat. Might perhaps be ok to say she was the<br />  only woman who lived with multiple husbands. Her mother in law Kunti had<br />  seven husbands (of course Pandu only in name). Our grandparents like to<br />  sugar coat to say she got kids via boon which is partially true but Vyasa<br />  says clearly that she had kids like...er..like everyone else :)) The<br />  grandmother of the Kauravas Satyavati (Bheeshma's stepmom) mothered Vyasa<br />  with Parasara before she married Bheeshma's father Shantanu. Her daughters<br />  in law in turn again married Vichitraveerya (Bheesma's step brother) but had<br />  Pandu and Dhritrashtra with Vyasa. So it was not anything new first of all.</p>
<p>  Draupadi is a very complex woman - when she is married to Arjuna with whom<br />  she was very much in love with she is forced to divide her marriage and<br />  attention among five men perhaps the first injustice done to her. Sri<br />  Krishna's advice to her is to live one year with each husband, bear a child<br />  and then be single technically. So her dharma only lasted five years not as<br />  long as we think. Throughout her life she is (as most women are ) is used by<br />  her husbands, although they retain their respect for her - she is never a<br />  doormat, even fends off Jayadratha's advances on her own. Her thirst for<br />  revenge/bathing in blood etc might seem excessive but to remember - this was<br />  not a time where people sweet talked their way into negotiation or asked<br />  forgiveness for what they did. Battle revenge was the only way they showed<br />  feelings for one another - that is if we assume that it happened literally.<br />  A more symbolic way of looking at it - hair is something to let go, a body<br />  part that greys, falls off and is made of dead cells. Blood is the symbol of<br />  life - by coating hair with blood she brings life back to what was dead in<br />  her due to multiple insults (perhaps am sounding cheesy dont' know but<br />  trying to put it the best way i can in english).</p>

<p>  Dear Malathi,</p>
<p>  Its been quite a while since I met someone so interested (and<br />  knowledgeable) on the subject as you are :)</p>
<p>  I've always wanted to believe that Arjuna did resent the others coming in -<br />  instead of the general washed up view that's shared in folklore (the way I<br />  heard it, anyway), that everything was hunky-dory between the others. As for<br />  Krishna - its very difficult, predicting what that one might have thought<br />  :) I have, however wondered about Draupadi's motivations in leaving for the<br />  forest with her husbands. I wonder what her reasons were, and judging by the<br />  fiery woman she seems to have been, I hardly dare believe that pathi-bhakthi<br />  was what set her off after them. What do you think?</p>
<p>  Hi Muthu,</p>
<p>  What you say about Draupadi is very true - especially the part about her<br />  not being able to choose anything. But then, I've wondered if perhaps the<br />  women who are reviled most in their lifetime are the ones universally<br />  worshipped after their deaths - that applies to her as well. I can<br />  understand her fury wanting to cleanse her hair in blood - thus, as they<br />  say, bringing about a whole war, but to lay everything at her feet is a tad<br />  too much, right?</p>
<p>  Perhaps what she really wanted (as many women do) was just to be<br />  acknowledged as someone important, whose opinions mattered - despite her<br />  so-called spirit, she was still only someone who'd married five men (gasp!)<br />  which made a freak. To live your life knowing everyone dissected your<br />  personal life every single moment can be a torment. No woman deserves a life<br />  like that.</p>

          Quiz on Draupadi        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Pavithra, to remember, Draupadi was not the only woman with multiple husbands in the Mahabharat. Might perhaps be ok to say she was the only woman who lived with multiple husbands. Her mother in law Kunti had seven husbands (of course Pandu only in name). Our grandparents like to sugar coat to say she got kids via boon which is partially true but Vyasa says clearly that she had kids like...er..like everyone else :)) The grandmother of the Kauravas Satyavati (Bheeshma's stepmom) mothered Vyasa with Parasara before she married Bheeshma's father Shantanu. Her daughters in law in turn again married Vichitraveerya (Bheesma's step brother) but had Pandu and Dhritrashtra with Vyasa. So it was not anything new first of all.<br />?<br />Draupadi is a very complex woman - when she is married to Arjuna with whom she was very much in love with she is forced to divide her marriage and attention among five men perhaps the first injustice done to her. Sri Krishna's advice to her is to live one year with each husband, bear a child and then be single technically. So her dharma only lasted five years not as long as we think. Throughout her life she is (as most women are ) is used by her husbands, although they retain their respect for her - she is never a doormat, even fends off Jayadratha's advances on her own. Her thirst for revenge/bathing in blood etc might seem excessive but to remember - this was not atime where people sweet talked their way into negotiation or asked forgiveness for what they did. Battle revenge was the only way they showed feelings for one another - that is if we assume that it happened literally. A moresymbolic way of looking at it - hair is something to let go, a body<br />part that greys, falls off and is made of dead cells. Blood is the symbol of life - by coating hair with blood she brings life back to what was dead in her due to multiple insults (perhaps am sounding cheesy dont' know but trying to put it the best way i can in english).<br />?<br />More later,<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Dear Malathi,<br />?<br />Its been quite a while since I met someone so interested (and knowledgeable) on the subject as you are :)<br />?<br />I've always wanted to believe that Arjuna did resent the others coming in -instead of the general washed up view that's shared in folklore (the way Iheard it, anyway), that?everything was hunky-dory between the others. Asfor Krishna - its very difficult, predicting what that one might have thought :)?I have, however wondered about Draupadi's motivations in leaving for the forest with her husbands. I wonder what her reasons were, and judging by the fiery woman she seems to have been, I hardly dare believe that pathi-bhakthi was what set her off after them. What do you think? <br />?<br />Hi Muthu,<br />?<br />What you say about Draupadi is very true - especially the part about her not being able to choose anything. But then, I've wondered if perhaps the women who are reviled most in their lifetime are the ones universally worshipped after their deaths - that applies to her as well. I can understand her fury wanting to cleanse her hair in blood - thus, as they say, bringing about a whole war, but to lay everything at her feet is a tad too much, right? <br />?<br />Perhaps what she really wanted (as many women do) was just to be acknowledged as someone important, whose opinions mattered - despite her so-called spirit, she was still only someone who'd married five men (gasp!) which made a freak. To live your life knowing everyone dissected your personal life every single moment can be a torment. No woman deserves a life like that. </p>

        <p>Dear Kathie, there is a reasonably good translation by Ramesh Menon (prettybulky though) that you might find interesting. <br />?<br />Every character in the Mahabharat has many shades to it indeed that is the beauty of the epic. There is noone who is really a hero or a villian everyone has circumstances and people with whom they are both. If you want to pick on any one character we can talk more in detail (I don't want to impose my views or my favorite characters on you :). As Muthu rightly said Draupadiherself is fascinating, perhaps the earliest feminist in the Hindu tradition. <br />?<br />Malathi</p>

        <p>Good volley of thoughts. I have never looked so deep into the<br />characters personalities or what they feel etc. I have even heard<br />criticism of her want to cleanse her hair with 100 peoples blood. But<br />a women who has undergone such humiliations - a queen being treated so<br />badly by the 100 brothers (or 99 brothers :)..what can we expect out<br />of her. And above this, the equality (?) or the respect the gents gave<br />to a females oath - giveing her what she wanted - I think that surely<br />needs a closer look. When we talk about women equality today, it was<br />well maintained in those days, where the husband feels that its his<br />duty to respect and provide what the wife needs. </p>

          Quiz on Draupadi        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Malathi,</p>
<p>Its been quite a while since I met someone so interested (and knowledgeable)<br />on the subject as you are :)</p>
<p>I've always wanted to believe that Arjuna did resent the others coming in -<br />instead of the general washed up view that's shared in folklore (the way I<br />heard it, anyway), that everything was hunky-dory between the others. As for<br />Krishna - its very difficult, predicting what that one might have thought<br />:) I have, however wondered about Draupadi's motivations in leaving for the<br />forest with her husbands. I wonder what her reasons were, and judging by the<br />fiery woman she seems to have been, I hardly dare believe that pathi-bhakthi<br />was what set her off after them. What do you think?</p>
<p>Hi Muthu,</p>
<p>What you say about Draupadi is very true - especially the part about her not<br />being able to choose anything. But then, I've wondered if perhaps the women<br />who are reviled most in their lifetime are the ones universally worshipped<br />after their deaths - that applies to her as well. I can understand her fury<br />wanting to cleanse her hair in blood - thus, as they say, bringing about a<br />whole war, but to lay everything at her feet is a tad too much, right?</p>
<p>Perhaps what she really wanted (as many women do) was just to be<br />acknowledged as someone important, whose opinions mattered - despite her<br />so-called spirit, she was still only someone who'd married five men (gasp!)<br />which made a freak. To live your life knowing everyone dissected your<br />personal life every single moment can be a torment. No woman deserves a life<br />like that.</p>
<p>Cheers, P.</p>

          Quiz on Draupadi        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I read Yajnaseni in English (yet to learn Oriya!) and think is <br />published by Rupa books and I remember buying it in Landmark, <br />Chennai 3-4 years back. 'The second turn' is a NBT publication as <br />part of the Indian classic series. Should be available in any NBT <br />shop/stall. </p>
<p>That said, I find Draupadi to be the most interesting character in <br />Mahabharatha and unfortunately, not many people have taken the pains <br />to study her part. Surprisingly the only books I could find were the <br />ones by Prathibha and as you've mentioned Chitra devi. There is a <br />story by Mahashweta Devi on Draupadi but its more allegory and not <br />the historical tale. Ofcourse, close to heart lies the <br />Bharathi's 'Panchali sabatham'.</p>
<p>There is a cult for Draupadi in the south and Draupadi Amman is <br />widely worshipped and praised. She is also equally reviled for her <br />decisions (especially one to cleanse her hair with the blood of the <br />Gauravas). Like someone said, we either damn our females or worship <br />them, never give them the mortal status. Thus being a very modern <br />herione of a great epic, we are worried about treating her like a <br />women who went through a lot of pain and probably followed her <br />dharma to take revenge. </p>
<p>In Yajnaseni, there is a strong reference to the 'longing' for Karna <br />as well. Karna is the first who comes to hit the fish during the <br />swayamwara but is rejected due to his caste. The mournful aspect of <br />the rejection of Karna which leads to him despising her and the <br />guilt she feels for that is given the prime reason for <br />the 'infatuation' towards Karna. I dont find it contrived precisely <br />because love is a complex phenomenon and the manifestation of it <br />varies with person (ie with your GF, wife or son etc). While <br />Draupadi's love for Krishna is spritual, for Karna it manifests as a <br />tragic longing. Its just this complexity that makes Draupadi hard to <br />classify into a box. </p>
<p>On the other hand, she also shows herself as a vengeful, <br />manipulative women when she entices Bheema to kill Keechaka or the <br />way she takes the revenge on the Gauravas. She is a difficult woman <br />to classify as a romantic idol or a vengeful bitch. She is both and <br />more than that. She is a great heroine who never chose anything in <br />her life as everything was thrusted on her first by her father, then <br />by her husbands and even Krishna uses her as bait. When she dies, <br />only Bheema stays with her and everyone else leaves. </p>
<p>Her complexity and character is unmatched in literary world or the <br />physical world. I have read quite a few books and I am yet to find <br />another who can match her in terms of the depth of the character or <br />the tragic sense she brings into the world as a woman. </p>

          Quiz on Draupadi        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Perhaps Chithra's Darupadi was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  materialistic - and I found it a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym <br />irritating, the way she couldn't seem to understand the very basic things<br />about human emotions. But I did like the way Vyasa was brought in, and<br />several other characters - the depiction of Sikandi, for example. Portraying<br />a character like is full of pitfalls, because it defies every norm of<br />existence, don't you think?</acronym></p>
<p>BTW - I tried my hand at the quiz but was so afraid that I might answer<br />wrongly that I didn't write it out. :) - I didn't know Draupadi's fragrance,<br />though. That was news to me. Great questions.</p>
<p>As for Karna-Draupadi romance ... isn't there a legend that says that she<br />was attracted to him (something about him being brother to the Pandavas and<br />all that)?</p>
<p>I must thank Muthu as well, for bringing up these books. Must read them<br />definitely. I'm a sucker for anything that has to do with the Mahabharatha.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I really liked Palace of Illusions although I felt the author could have well avoided the fictional Karna-Draupadi romance. She does a reasonably goodjob with describing the horrors of the war, Sri Krishna's character and Yudhistir. Chitra's Draupadi seems very materialistic though in comparison tothe Draupadi of the Mahabharat. But the novel is definitely a page turner and does come across as a respectful tribute to the original.<br />?<br />Muthu, is there an english translation available of Yajnaseni? I must definitely read MTV's second turn, thanks for the reference.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Good to read about Draupadi. I saw the mail on the Chitra Devi <br />Banerjee's new novel by Pavithra. But I hold the other <br />one 'Yajnaseni' by Prathiba Roy with a lot more relevant in terms of <br />the story or Draupadi. Written in Oriya, this is a fantastic take on <br />the complex character of Draupadi and her turbulant life. <br />While I understand the nitty-gritty nuances of the originals, my <br />understanding is that it is the interpretations that bring out the <br />beauty of the tale. Another interesting novel is 'The second turn' <br />by MT Vasudevan nair (Irandam moolam in the original Malayalam) <br />which is Mahabharatha from Bheema's view point. Stuck between a <br />rightful elder brother and always overstaged by his younger, <br />charismatic brother Arjun, the novel looks into the life of Bheema <br />and how he handles it.<br />You can a read a little review I wrote long back here<br /><a href="http://sibipranav" title="http://sibipranav">http://sibipranav</a>. blogspot. com/2006/ 05/draupadi- yajnaseni. html</p>

<p>Attempts :<br />1. (Not sure) Karna; was turned down due to his perceived parentage<br />2. (No idea)<br />3. (This seems to be one of those long 10-mark essay questions)<br />Rishi Dhurvaasa who was famous for his anger and "Pidi Shaapam" <br />temperament.<br />Duryodhana sent him to the Ashram of Paandavas during Vana vaasam. <br />When he went Draupadi had already finished serving food for <br />everybody and washed the Akshaya Paathram (the divine vessel given <br />to her by Lord Surya - it will grant any and every food item without <br />any shortage - "A-Kshaya = never waning" - but one condition - it <br />will work only until Draupadi finishes serving food for the day and <br />washes it). So serving food for Rishi Dhurvaasa was difficult - but <br />refusing was far more dangerous, knowing his reputation for cursing. <br />Dhurvaasa Rishi went to take bath before meals. Meanwhile Draupadi <br />thought of her usual saviour (who else but today's Birthday boy - <br />Shri Krishna). Krishna came, heard the story and asked her to bring <br />the Akshaya Paathram. He found one grain of rice stuck to the vessel <br />(some versions talk about a green leaf ('Keerai') as well). He took <br />the grain, said "May the Almighty be satisfied with this" and ate <br />it. And as the Almighty Himself had said this and ate the grain, the <br />hunger of the whole universe got satiated, including Dhurvaasa, who <br />was bathing. Now Rishi Dhurvaasa felt that he can not eat any more. <br />So to avoid an embarassment, he left the place without coming back <br />to the Paandava's Ashram.</p>
<p>4. Sairanthari (am not sure of the spelling)<br />5. (1) Keechaka at Viratapuram - killed by Bheema<br />(2) Jayadratha during Vana vaasam - she is alone in the Ashram <br />and she defends herself. Later the Paandavas search for Jayadratha, <br />Arjuna captures him and humiliates him. He is let off on Draupadi's <br />pardon. (To avenge, Jayadratha gets a boon from Shiva to have the <br />ability to stop all Paandavas other than Arjuna and so happened the <br />Abhimanyu episode and the subsequent revenge in the war).<br />6. Bheema<br />7. (No idea)</p>

          Quiz on Draupadi        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Attempts :<br />1. (Not sure) Karna; was turned down due to his perceived parentage<br />2. (No idea)<br />3. (This seems to be one of those long 10-mark essay questions)<br />Rishi Dhurvaasa who was famous for his anger and "Pidi Shaapam" <br />temperament.<br />Duryodhana sent him to the Ashram of Paandavas during Vana vaasam. <br />When he went Draupadi had already finished serving food for <br />everybody and washed the Akshaya Paathram (the divine vessel given <br />to her by Lord Surya - it will grant any and every food item without <br />any shortage - "A-Kshaya = never waning" - but one condition - it <br />will work only until Draupadi finishes serving food for the day and <br />washes it). So serving food for Rishi Dhurvaasa was difficult - but <br />refusing was far more dangerous, knowing his reputation for cursing. <br />Dhurvaasa Rishi went to take bath before meals. Meanwhile Draupadi <br />thought of her usual saviour (who else but today's Birthday boy - <br />Shri Krishna). Krishna came, heard the story and asked her to bring <br />the Akshaya Paathram. He found one grain of rice stuck to the vessel <br />(some versions talk about a green leaf ('Keerai') as well). He took <br />the grain, said "May the Almighty be satisfied with this" and ate <br />it. And as the Almighty Himself had said this and ate the grain, the <br />hunger of the whole universe got satiated, including Dhurvaasa, who <br />was bathing. Now Rishi Dhurvaasa felt that he can not eat any more. <br />So to avoid an embarassment, he left the place without coming back <br />to the Paandava's Ashram.</p>
<p>4. Sairanthari (am not sure of the spelling)<br />5. (1) Keechaka at Viratapuram - killed by Bheema<br />(2) Jayadratha during Vana vaasam - she is alone in the Ashram <br />and she defends herself. Later the Paandavas search for Jayadratha, <br />Arjuna captures him and humiliates him. He is let off on Draupadi's <br />pardon. (To avenge, Jayadratha gets a boon from Shiva to have the <br />ability to stop all Paandavas other than Arjuna and so happened the <br />Abhimanyu episode and the subsequent revenge in the war).<br />6. Bheema<br />7. (No idea)</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />NV<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Malathi Mahadevan <br /><dmaloo@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  1 Who was Draupadi's first suitor and why did she turn him down?<br />  2 Draupadi appeals to Lord Krishna about being wife to five <br />brothers. What was Lord Krishna's suggestion?<br />  3 Duryodhana set up a rishi to meet Draupadi for alms. Who was <br />this Rishi and<br />  what was the outcome?<br />  4 Draupadi served as maid to Queen of Matsya Raj, what was her <br />name.<br />  5 Draupadi defends herself against two men who made advances to <br />her. In one<br />  she was defended by Bheema. Who was the other king?<br />  6 Which was her husbands tries to protect her from death during <br />the last journey<br />  of the pandavas on himalayan slopes?<br />  7 Draupadi's skin had natural fragrance of which flower?</p>
