      <div class="content">
        <p>Nice to see another RKN fan here. After Tom Sawyer's pinning, I thought Chandran's pining for his lady love in 'The Bachelor of Arts' as the best.</p>
<p>In fact I would rate that book one of the best ever book I read. It takes you into the period and along with the characters. I had a similar feeling when I read 'Gone With The Wind' book (this one I read over a course of 1 month, after finishing the book, I felt so sad to have come out of the story). BoA was such a book.</p>

<blockquote><p>  I like Khuswant singh too although i find his humor very sexist at <br />  times. I am a die hard RK Narayan fan. I read lots of indian authors, <br />  nris especailly. Jhumpa Lahiri is fantastic read - i thoroughly <br />  enjoyed Interpreter of Maladies. I also think Indira Sundaresan and <br />  Arvind Adiga are ok. </p>

<p>    my favourite is khuswant.<br />    for his DELHI and TRAIN TO PAKISTAN<br />    every one of his autobigraphies( he writes one and then continues <br />  to <br />    live on. he has even named one ON THE DOORSTEPS OF DEATH</p>
<p>    saucy writing, ful of humour. he writes what he feels, not shackled <br />    by norms of writing.</p>
<p>    his books of fiction written later were trashily sexy and people <br />    tend to judge him by that.</p>
<p>    r.k narayan is wonderfully simple in his writing. never ever writes <br />    about complicated things.</p>
<p>      I know that there are voracious readers in our group. So thought <br />    of starting<br />      a thread on Indian authors in English. I use to read a lot of <br />    Englisg books<br />      / novels when I was in college. Later I felt that there are lot <br />    more in<br />      Tamizh to be read so I quit reading English.

        <p>Thank you Venkat, I must check out this author. <br />As for Naipaul, I used to like him. Once upon a time. Then I read his <br />book on India, a wounded civilisation. I was just disgusted. This man <br />was not born in India. If you are not born in a country your <br />perspective is completely different from others. He liberally makes <br />fun of RKN and UR Anantamurti, both highly respected authors. Makes <br />dumb remarks like a bullock cart costing more than a second hand car <br />in Europe. In generally a collection of highly sarcastic, opinionated <br />remarks. Turned me off completely. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Gandhi, the context of 'asocial' as pertaining to the nobel prize <br />  is the inability for an external entity to judge the impact of the <br />  author's work on society. The readers of RKN's books were restricted <br />  to upper middle class/rich elite well read people although he wrote <br />  about the common man. If it were today he would have online fans or <br />  other means where one can judge the readers views and how he goes <br />  down with audience. In those days there were none. BTW as Kathie <br />  pointed out some english critics did consider his english awkward, <br />  although that is debatable. More indian critics like Shashi Tharoor <br />  thought he was story book like, no serious comment on culture/society <br />  and anything for adults. (These are not my opinions, BTW).</p>
<p>  Malathi<br />re: during one of his interviews in his 90th birthday he said his </p></blockquote>
<p>purpose was to write stories. he said that is his objective. he liked <br />people reading books. reading books is a very good habit and therefore <br />he helps society. he wanted to be known as a storyteller. he compared <br />himself to the village brahmin who gives "kathakalatshebam" during the <br />sivarathri times. he said he likes villages but wanted to live in a <br />city. he said he liked chennai the most because it is both trditional <br />and modern. </p>
<p>his stories and characters depict the detchment a hindu tries to <br />achieve in his life. for example novels like vendor of sweets. he <br />depicted the spontaneous evolution of an indian yogi in "guide"- a fact <br />conveniently missed in the movie version.</p>
<p>his humor has certain undercurrent tragedies most of the time. <br />financial expert and mr.sampath for example. some of his characters <br />like daisy in painter of signs was excellant.</p>
<p>chennai had his admirers like HINDU -RAM. his works were published till <br />a few months prior to his death. the loss of his daughter to cancer had <br />very much affected him in his final years.</p>
<p>he is relevant in modern society. i think story tellers are not yet a <br />vanished tribe-even in the era of net and cellphones.</p>

          Indian authors in English        </div>

        <p>Hi Gandhi, the context of 'asocial' as pertaining to the nobel prize <br />is the inability for an external entity to judge the impact of the <br />author's work on society. The readers of RKN's books were restricted <br />to upper middle class/rich elite well read people although he wrote <br />about the common man. If it were today he would have online fans or <br />other means where one can judge the readers views and how he goes <br />down with audience. In those days there were none. BTW as Kathie <br />pointed out some english critics did consider his english awkward, <br />although that is debatable. More indian critics like Shashi Tharoor <br />thought he was story book like, no serious comment on culture/society <br />and anything for adults. (These are not my opinions, BTW).</p>

His main <br />failure <br />    was that he was a loner for the most part and did not involve and <br />    evolve society/culture around his work, which is what <br />  differentiated <br />    Tagore, whose work inspired many freedom fighters.</p>
<p>    I too thought for a very long time that he was denied the Nobel <br />    for 'unknown' reasons, until recently another family member told <br />me <br />    that he was told, by a member of the Nobel committee itself <br />    informally that it was denied due to lack of social involvement <br />  which <br />    is one of the factors necessary.</p>
<p>  re: so nice to meet a person from RKN family. he was typical of his <br />  characters in malgudi. the characters in malgudi are strangely <br />  insulated into the society -microcosm-which they belong. it is <br />unfair <br />  to call him asocial. south-indian society is exactly what is most <br />  characteristic of himself. an insularity-not isolation. they live <br />in <br />  a modern world yet holding to a 2000 year culture back. </p>
<p>  you read to day's hindu newspaper which still carries a news <br />article <br />  daily about a particular religious discourse-previously it would be <br />  in the last page and it is in the second front page now. indeed the <br />  editor is a left leaning person. but holding to the tradition.</p>
<p>  RKN depicted the society in southindia that is <br />  consevative,orthodox,self preserving ,zealously guarded and <br />  traditional society which struggles to hold itself in 20th century.</p>
<p>  "malgudi will survive" he wrote to graham greene when india got <br />  independence. he knew the modern developments cannot disturb the <br />  stillness of a southindian society.</p>
<p>  even to day i feel place like chidambaram has many bronze age <br />customs <br />  and rituals. vedic age brahmin priests and internet savvy post-<br />  graduate medical students live as neighbours here amicabily. that <br />is <br />  modernity and tradition in one same miliue. that is what typifies <br />  RKN'spersonality. he is an english genious and yet a tradition <br />bound <br />  family man who is social-anxious.</p>
<p>  if Seenivasa Ramanujam of mathematics and RKN are seen together <br />were <br />  is the difference? they both look like the same average kumbakonam <br />  brahmins to me. both are shy introverts.</p>
<p>  some of my ancestors who lived in kumbakonam knew about RKN <br />ancestors <br />  too. life in malgudi hardly change. like any two characters meet <br />in <br />  the streets of malgudi and talk with a overfamiliar tone ....we too <br />  are like characters in malgudi and are talkative and overfamiliar <br />to <br />  each of us.</p>

        <p>Hi Venkat, the Rasipuram family is huge, yes am sure we are related <br />very distantly then - btw we were related by marriage to one of my <br />cousins to his brother Laxman so it was not direct.

<p>        venketesh<br />      re: he was in chennai from 1930s. he was with the hindu news <br />  paper <br />      and gemini pictures. he was a widower by then. he was having a <br />      depressive disorder and had psychotic symptoms. he took almost <br />3-<br />  4 <br />      years to recover. he used to walk in marina beach from the <br />napier <br />      bridge to lighthouse back and forth 2-3 times in evening that <br />  time.</p>
<p>      his writings always had a tamil influence. his association with <br />    tamil <br />      writers -though not at personal level-was significant in the <br />    literary <br />      output. his mastery of language and the remarcable simplicity <br />  were <br />      the one which characterised him.</p>
<p>      bachelour of arts and english teacher were more closer to his <br />  real <br />      life. he should be better known as english-southindian writer.</p>
<p>      his family hailed from kumbakonam and migrated to mysore <br />  coimbatore <br />      and chennai. his tenure in parliament was rather symbolic <br />gesture <br />    by <br />      the indian government to honour him.</p>
<p>      i liked the most his works like financial expert, painter of <br />  signs <br />      and world of nagaraj.</p>
<p>      i do not think he was away from reality in the case related to <br />  his <br />      delusions and claivoyance about his dead wive. such behaviours <br />  are <br />      common amongst writers. writers often have exceptional <br />imageries <br />    that <br />      would some times come delusional pseudo-communities and <br />      impostering...etc. he belongs to a society which has such <br />culture <br />      bound beleives.</p>

<p>RKN depicted the society in southindia that is <br />consevative,orthodox,self preserving ,zealously guarded and <br />traditional society which struggles to hold itself in 20th century.</p>
<p>"malgudi will survive" he wrote to graham greene when india got <br />independence. he knew the modern developments cannot disturb the <br />stillness of a southindian society.</p>
<p>even to day i feel place like chidambaram has many bronze age customs <br />and rituals. vedic age brahmin priests and internet savvy post-<br />graduate medical students live as neighbours here amicabily. that is <br />modernity and tradition in one same miliue. that is what typifies <br />RKN'spersonality. he is an english genious and yet a tradition bound <br />family man who is social-anxious.</p>
<p>if Seenivasa Ramanujam of mathematics and RKN are seen together were <br />is the difference? they both look like the same average kumbakonam <br />brahmins to me. both are shy introverts.</p>
<p>some of my ancestors who lived in kumbakonam knew about RKN ancestors <br />too. life in malgudi hardly change. like any two characters meet in <br />the streets of malgudi and talk with a overfamiliar tone ....we too <br />are like characters in malgudi and are talkative and overfamiliar to <br />each of us.</p>

        <p>Hi Venkat, yes my father has seen some of those experiments. My father <br />is a scientist, and he still thinks those men were nuts, including RKN. <br />But am not so dismissive and we don't really know, I think. Those <br />incidents were also part of why RKN and his brother Laxman did not get <br />along too, Laxman was the modern mumbai guy who did not like it either.</p>
<p>RKN was very much in love with his young wife who died of cholera then. <br />He never remarried. My father often used to say if he had redirected <br />his pain or sorrow to some social work insteado of seances we might <br />have had another Nobel prize winner - since Nobel committee found him <br />lacking in social contact which is one of their criteria.</p>

<p>Hi Gandhi ram</p>
<p>thats nice.<br />my personal favourites are "the guide" and "a tiger for malgudi"</p>
<p>i got an excellent deal in chennai book fair. almost his entire set <br />of books for 1500.</p>
<p>do you know kalki and narayan worked for <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  vasan almost during the <br />same period.</acronym></p>
<p>please check our archives for an excellent discussion on the <br />rasipuram family with malathi giving us a lot of insider info.</p>

<p>i like narayans personality and his simplicity. his carreer spanning <br />over 6 decades was most productive one. he was avid reader of tamil <br />and has read kambaramayanam and silapathikaram thoroughly with a help <br />of a private tutor. </p>
<p>he missed nobel prize for not any real reason. to this day he is my <br />real favorite indian english writer.</p>
<p>kushwantsingh, shoba de... are different categories altogether.</p>
<p>mahatma gandhi and jawaharlal nehru are respectively good in their <br />period. rabindra tagore's poetry and novels in english also worth <br />mentioning eventhough they belong to an another genre.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  my favourite is khuswant.<br />  for his DELHI and TRAIN TO PAKISTAN<br />  every one of his autobigraphies( he writes one and then continues <br />to <br />  live on. he has even named one ON THE DOORSTEPS OF DEATH</p>
<p>  saucy writing, ful of humour. he writes what he feels, not shackled <br />  by norms of writing.</p>
<p>  his books of fiction written later were trashily sexy and people <br />  tend to judge him by that.</p>
<p>  r.k narayan is wonderfully simple in his writing. never ever writes <br />  about complicated things.</p>
<p>    I know that there are voracious readers in our group. So thought <br />  of starting<br />    a thread on Indian authors in English. I use to read a lot of <br />  Englisg books<br />    / novels when I was in college. Later I felt that there are lot <br />  more in<br />    Tamizh to be read so I quit reading English. Of late I have read <br />  very few<br />    books. Latest being Chetan Bhagat / Jhumpa Lahiri as their <br />language<br />    readability is easy - For me. Others may differ in this point. <br />Do <br />  let me<br />    know others as well and also share your experiences.</p>

          Indian authors in English        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>JUST A TIDBIT</p>
<p>The first book written by an Indian in English was by Sake Dean<br />Mahomet, titled Travels of Dean Mahomet; Mahomet's travel narrative<br />was published in 1793 in England. In its early stages it was<br />influenced by the Western art form of the novel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view" title="http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view">http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view</a>?<br />docId=ft4h4nb20n&amp;brand=eschol</p>
<blockquote><p>    my favourite is khuswant.<br />    for his DELHI and TRAIN TO PAKISTAN<br />    every one of his autobigraphies( he writes one and then <br />continues <br />  to <br />    live on. he has even named one ON THE DOORSTEPS OF DEATH</p>
<p>    saucy writing, ful of humour. he writes what he feels, not <br />  shackled <br />    by norms of writing.</p>
<p>    his books of fiction written later were trashily sexy and people <br />    tend to judge him by that.</p>
<p>    r.k narayan is wonderfully simple in his writing. never ever <br />  writes <br />    about complicated things.</p>
<p>      I know that there are voracious readers in our group. So <br />thought <br />    of starting<br />      a thread on Indian authors in English. I use to read a lot of <br />    Englisg books<br />      / novels when I was in college. Later I felt that there are <br />lot <br />    more in<br />      Tamizh to be read so I quit reading English. Of late I have <br />read <br />    very few<br />      books. Latest being Chetan Bhagat / Jhumpa Lahiri as their <br />  language<br />      readability is easy - For me. Others may differ in this <br />point. <br />  Do <br />    let me<br />      know others as well and also share your experiences.</p>
