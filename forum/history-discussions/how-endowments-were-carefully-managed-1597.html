</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Read an inscription found by Dr.Rajamanickanar institute of Historic <br />research in Pullamangai Thiru Alanthuraiyar temple (Near Kumbakonam).</p>
<p>It belongs to 24th regional year of Rajaraja.</p>
<p>The king had made few of the lands tax free (Iraiyili) since they <br />were belonging to odhuvars (Nindrothum sattap peru makkal) in his <br />12th regional year. In 24th year he found that there was no <br />thiruppatiyam chanting happening - there were no odhuvars available. <br />Probably the inspecting officer should have observed this and <br />silently made an observatory remark - so the king issued a royal <br />order to take away the iraiyili and make it taxable land.</p>
<p>This inscription throws a rare glipmse of how endowments provided to <br />temples were not only audited but were even taken back when the <br />purpose was not served.</p>
<p>Given their rudimentary infrastructure, it is amazing to see the <br />quality of governance.</p>

        <p>Dear SPS,<br />It is still not evident to me that Vandiyatevan was from Tiruvallam near Ranipet.U have not answered how this can be reconciled with Kalki's statement that Vtevan spent all his early years in the dry regions north of Palar and was therefore afraid of water.That he was from Vanarkulam is well known and this can plausibly be identified with the Bana dynasty.What Vtevan and Kundavi did after their marriage and where they lived is also something which needs historic documentation and not just conjecture.<br />GR</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It is Mr.G.Rangarajan, <acronym title="Indian Instittue of Technology" IIT</acronym  Prof is mailing under ID vijayalakshmi - <br />his wife - similar to "Sujatha" Rangarajan.</acronym></p>
<p>Calender for each Province was calculated on the King's ascendency to <br />throne. In Raja raja's case, it was Aadi Punarvasu 985 AD- which was <br />amavasya day this year! 3rd Regnl yr of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  means, 3rd yr after Aadi <br />punarvasu of 985... The same date would have been different for a <br />Pandya king in terms of his Regnl yr.. Subsequently Sakha Calender <br />started figuring in inscriptions...</acronym></p>
<p>Re Thiruvallam, it is evident that Kundavai &amp; Vdthvn ruled over from <br />there after their wedding.. Probably he was the C-in-C of Western <br />Command (Melpadi) - supporting <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's daughter Kundavi + Vimaladithan <br />of W.Chalukyas. Rajendra was Nothern Commander stationed at <br />Thiruvottiyur. Eastern would have been Poompuhar or Nagai and <br />Southern is at Nagerkoil / Suseendram.</acronym></p>
<p>Banas @ Vanars may be from Rayalaseema. But that should have been <br />their dynasty's birth place.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It is Mr.G.Rangarajan, <acronym title="Indian Instittue of Technology" IIT</acronym  Prof is mailing under ID vijayalakshmi - <br />his wife - similar to "Sujatha" Rangarajan.</acronym></p>
<p>Calender for each Province was calculated on the King's ascendency to <br />throne. In Raja raja's case, it was Aadi Punarvasu 985 AD- which was <br />amavasya day this year! 3rd Regnl yr of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  means, 3rd yr after Aadi <br />punarvasu of 985... The same date would have been different for a <br />Pandya king in terms of his Regnl yr.. Subsequently Sakha Calender <br />started figuring in inscriptions...</acronym></p>
<p>Re Thiruvallam, it is evident that Kundavai &amp; Vdthvn ruled over from <br />there after their wedding.. Probably he was the C-in-C of Western <br />Command (Melpadi) - supporting <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's daughter Kundavi + Vimaladithan <br />of W.Chalukyas. Rajendra was Nothern Commander stationed at <br />Thiruvottiyur. Eastern would have been Poompuhar or Nagai and <br />Southern is at Nagerkoil / Suseendram.</acronym></p>
<p>Banas @ Vanars may be from Rayalaseema. But that should have been <br />their dynasty's birth place.</p>

<p>There is a Vallam village near Thanjavur - which I mistook as the <br />Village from where Vandhiyathevan hailed - when I visited the place <br />about 10 - 15 yrs back. This was MUTHARAYARs town as mentioned in <br />earlier mails.

Most of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's <br />inscriptions in Big Temple denote his 29th Rgnl Yr.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>In the Thiruvallam temple, inscriptions mention of one MADURANTAKA <br />KANDRADITHAN (who is supposed to be the son of Uthama Chozha.)His <br />inscriptions are not found after 997 AD (according to Sethuraman). He <br />was incharge of auditing the temple accounts in <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's Rule and had the <br />authority to punish those who mismanaged the temple funds / affairs. </acronym></p>
<p>At the entrance of the sanctum, statue of a person is seen in the <br />sitting posture with both his hands NAILED to the floor!</p>
<p>Inscriptions mention that he was punished by MADURANTAKA KANDRADITHAN <br />on behalf of the Emperor - for having misused temple funds!</p>
<p>There are similar instances in Suseendram, Nagerkoil etc.</p>
<p>Another thing : Dr. Jaybee has mentioned in the Agathiyar Group that <br />in the Siva Temple of (Ponnamaravathi Thirupathur) T. Vairavanpatti <br />(not the one near Pillayarpatti), inscriptions of Rajaraja in his 3rd <br />Regnl Year are found in VATTEZHUTU - which was normally found in <br />Pandyas' days only!

        <p>Hi SPS,<br />Can u tell me the basis for identifying Tiruvallam near Ranipet with Vallam of the Vana kings?In <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  it is stated that Vandiyatevan spent all his earlier years in the dry regions to the north of Palar river.Ranipet being almost near Palar does not fit this description.Banas are contemporaneous with Vaidumbas and Gangas and Parantaka Cola is said to have fought a battle successfully against Krishna II (Rashtrakuta king) at Tiruvallam.In this battle the Banas are said to have lost their territory.(<acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastri).Pulikesi II is also said to have attacked Banas who were ruling in Rayalaseema as feudatories of the Pallavas.Thus Rayalaseema seems to be a more likely location of the Bana kingdom.<br />GR</acronym></p>

<p>Nice information. </p>
<p>There is a Vallam village near Thanjavur - which I mistook as the <br />Village from where Vandhiyathevan hailed - when I visited the place <br />about 10 - 15 yrs back. This was MUTHARAYARs town as mentioned in <br />earlier mails. Two years back I came to know that it is THIRUVALLAM -<br />located near Ranipet / <acronym title="Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited" BHEL</acronym  Township - from where Vandhiyathevan <br />hailed. Kundavi &amp; Vthvn ruled together from this place after their <br />wedding. MELPADI (Western Command) is hardly 10 Kms away -where in <br />his 30th Rgnl Yr - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  constructed Arinjayeswaram (Pallippadai) in <br />memory of his grand father Arinjayan - probably the LAST of the <br />temple he constructed in his 30 yrs span of Rule. Most of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's <br />inscriptions in Big Temple denote his 29th Rgnl Yr.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>In the Thiruvallam temple, inscriptions mention of one MADURANTAKA <br />KANDRADITHAN (who is supposed to be the son of Uthama Chozha.)His <br />inscriptions are not found after 997 AD (according to Sethuraman). He <br />was incharge of auditing the temple accounts in <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's Rule and had the <br />authority to punish those who mismanaged the temple funds / affairs. </acronym></p>
<p>At the entrance of the sanctum, statue of a person is seen in the <br />sitting posture with both his hands NAILED to the floor!</p>
<p>Inscriptions mention that he was punished by MADURANTAKA KANDRADITHAN <br />on behalf of the Emperor - for having misused temple funds!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi all,</p>
<p>  Read an inscription found by Dr.Rajamanickanar<br />  institute of Historic <br />  research in Pullamangai Thiru Alanthuraiyar temple<br />  (Near Kumbakonam).</p>
<p>  It belongs to 24th regional year of Rajaraja.</p>
<p>  The king had made few of the lands tax free<br />  (Iraiyili) since they <br />  were belonging to odhuvars (Nindrothum sattap peru<br />  makkal) in his <br />  12th regional year. In 24th year he found that there<br />  was no <br />  thiruppatiyam chanting happening - there were no<br />  odhuvars available. <br />  Probably the inspecting officer should have observed<br />  this and <br />  silently made an observatory remark - so the king<br />  issued a royal <br />  order to take away the iraiyili and make it taxable<br />  land.</p>
<p>  This inscription throws a rare glipmse of how<br />  endowments provided to <br />  temples were not only audited but were even taken<br />  back when the <br />  purpose was not served.</p>
<p>  Given their rudimentary infrastructure, it is<br />  amazing to see the <br />  quality of governance.</p>

<blockquote><p>DEAR GOKUL,</p></blockquote>
<p>Nice information. </p>
<p>There is a Vallam village near Thanjavur - which I mistook as the <br />Village from where Vandhiyathevan hailed - when I visited the place <br />about 10 - 15 yrs back. This was MUTHARAYARs town as mentioned in <br />earlier mails. Two years back I came to know that it is THIRUVALLAM -<br />located near Ranipet / <acronym title="Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited" BHEL</acronym  Township - from where Vandhiyathevan <br />hailed. Kundavi &amp; Vthvn ruled together from this place after their <br />wedding. MELPADI (Western Command) is hardly 10 Kms away -where in <br />his 30th Rgnl Yr - <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  constructed Arinjayeswaram (Pallippadai) in <br />memory of his grand father Arinjayan - probably the LAST of the <br />temple he constructed in his 30 yrs span of Rule. Most of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's <br />inscriptions in Big Temple denote his 29th Rgnl Yr.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>In the Thiruvallam temple, inscriptions mention of one MADURANTAKA <br />KANDRADITHAN (who is supposed to be the son of Uthama Chozha.)His <br />inscriptions are not found after 997 AD (according to Sethuraman). He <br />was incharge of auditing the temple accounts in <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's Rule and had the <br />authority to punish those who mismanaged the temple funds / affairs. </acronym></p>
<p>At the entrance of the sanctum, statue of a person is seen in the <br />sitting posture with both his hands NAILED to the floor!</p>
<p>Inscriptions mention that he was punished by MADURANTAKA KANDRADITHAN <br />on behalf of the Emperor - for having misused temple funds!</p>
<p>There are similar instances in Suseendram, Nagerkoil etc.</p>
<p>Another thing : Dr. Jaybee has mentioned in the Agathiyar Group that <br />in the Siva Temple of (Ponnamaravathi Thirupathur) T. Vairavanpatti <br />(not the one near Pillayarpatti), inscriptions of Rajaraja in his 3rd <br />Regnl Year are found in VATTEZHUTU - which was normally found in <br />Pandyas' days only! Spoke to Dr. Kkvn last night.. He was also <br />thrilled and needed more information ..</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi all,</p>
<p>  Read an inscription found by Dr.Rajamanickanar<br />  institute of Historic <br />  research in Pullamangai Thiru Alanthuraiyar temple<br />  (Near Kumbakonam).</p>
<p>  It belongs to 24th regional year of Rajaraja.</p>
<p>  The king had made few of the lands tax free<br />  (Iraiyili) since they <br />  were belonging to odhuvars (Nindrothum sattap peru<br />  makkal) in his <br />  12th regional year. In 24th year he found that there<br />  was no <br />  thiruppatiyam chanting happening - there were no<br />  odhuvars available. <br />  Probably the inspecting officer should have observed<br />  this and <br />  silently made an observatory remark - so the king<br />  issued a royal <br />  order to take away the iraiyili and make it taxable<br />  land.</p>
<p>  This inscription throws a rare glipmse of how<br />  endowments provided to <br />  temples were not only audited but were even taken<br />  back when the <br />  purpose was not served.</p>
<p>  Given their rudimentary infrastructure, it is<br />  amazing to see the <br />  quality of governance.</p>
