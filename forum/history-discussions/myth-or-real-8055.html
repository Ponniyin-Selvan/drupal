<p>Ravanan with 10heads - myth ?? Why can't it be true ?? Or atleast with multiple heads which could have been exaggerated to 10???</p>
<p>Gene mutation. Today we are seeing many babies being born sticking together. In todays scenario there are lots of people, particularly twins, born together and survive - some have four hands. But if more than 2 go together then chance of survival goes down. But could it be - could it be a reality that such joined-together babies were common those days?? Could it be genemutation (and parinama valarchi) stopped over period of time and here we are the two handed two-legged humans?? May be those brahma (4heads), shanmuga (6 headed) ashtabujadurgai (8handed) and ravanas (10 headed) are gene mutations and walked this earth. Pl remember. Pl remember this could sound strange now but could have been a reality once. Once men used to have long hair (kondai) now leave alone kondai people are getting baldier !! I heard that somewhere in siberia they have discoverd an elephant with horn. And we now believe superstuctures like dinosaur walked this earth. So it could well be a reality that shiva had 4 hands and so could be shanmuga with 6 heads. Also one logical thought - when we created ( uruvagapadhuthumbodhu) gods why would we disfigure them giving 4 heads / 8 hands etc??? Think of the fact when goddesses like lakshmi being worshiped as unparalled beauty, why would they have been given 4 hands. There are multiple ways to describe them if they had to be projected as powerful figures. So did we miss out something in those eons ???</p>
<p>Also facts like sarabeshwar (lion headed), narashima (lion headed), nandi (bull-headed), kamadenu (cowheaded) -- could it be a fusion between a lion and a half-man turned monkey resulted in some of these avatars ?? If it were imagination of some crazy group of people of a very very ancient world, those people would not have such refined creativity. On the other hand, If a mule can happen between horse and donkey today, may be a particular stage of metamorphosis could have allowed such creations to occur.</p>
<p>Just because we don't have proof that it can occur, we cannot dismiss it - atleast till we have a proof that it could not have happened. </p>

<p>Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor for spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi', Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>  History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />  history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />  in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />  several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />  of Gandhi etc.)</p>

<p>    Hello Vairam</p>
<p>    Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />  the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />  etc).</p>
<p>    Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />    If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />  on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />  Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>    If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />  references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />  control problem irukke?</p>
<p>    Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />  according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />  case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>    Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />  patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />  proper in its explanations.And historians must have a convincing record<br />  to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />  current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />  bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>    Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />  research anyway.</p>
<p>    Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />  survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />  story come by?</p>
<p>    I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />  all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />  sense.</p>
<p>    As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil(rest his soul), I am in search of<br />  Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />  he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />  short cut :-).</p>
<p>    Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />  now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />  Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />    Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />  Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />  say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />  scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>      Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>      you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />      My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />  said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />      It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>      Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />  history.</p>
<p>      But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />  know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>      I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />  had year ago!</p>
<p>      I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />  believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />      Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />  what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />      Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />  against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />  other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />  finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />  welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>      Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />  labyrinth again.</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />  and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />  have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>        However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />  anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />  line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />  similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>        I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />  Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />        Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />  Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />  study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>           He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />  the literature itself.</p>
<p>        For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />  and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />  foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />  not be so.</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />  entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />  Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />  Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>        As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />  adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>        I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />  noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />  Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />  poet.</p>
<p>        Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />  itself makes a mile of difference – the usage of that term, on how a<br />  person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />  literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />  written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>        I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />  location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />  thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />  spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />  there, it is also difficult to prove …it was not there.<br />        Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />  as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />  with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />  southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />  Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />  believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />  question posed before too.</p>
<p>        I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />  avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age –<br />  his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />  there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>        When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />  it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />  the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />  possible.</p>
<p>        Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />  this research?</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />  enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />  experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />  entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>           Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />  are.</p>
<p>        Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />  to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed – purely due to his<br />  dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />  tread.</p>
<p>        However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />  relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>        Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />  literature – just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />  bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />  these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />  awe.</p>
<p>        However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />  even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />        These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />  though many do not agree.</p>
<p>        PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />  argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;</p>

<p>          Hi Ravi,<br />          Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />  in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />  various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />  He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />  research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />          I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />  of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />  Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />  members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />  left in these pages.</p>
<p>            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />  cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />  base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />          Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />  been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />  Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />  knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />  work - The Eight Anthologies).<br />          He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />  claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />  his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />  to an off spring of Sanskrit by scholars like KAN Shastri). From 1952 to<br />  nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />  Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />  out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />  biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />  <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a> <http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html  </p>
<p>          So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />  you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />  your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>            History does not account for various stories and tales of the<br />  bard, which seems to be having many lines of history before being sung.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />  research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />  cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />  base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>            Nothing wrong, but then there are gaps that can derail a<br />  train.</p>

<p>              Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's<br />  Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating<br />  of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for<br />  dating of various literature.</p>

<p>                   It is difficult to determine decisively who is ancient<br />  among the<br />                   nayanmars, nor the Thiruthondar Puranam that lists<br />  hagiography of 63 saints<br />                   and 9 Thogai adiyargal is conclusively exhaustive. For<br />  example, Auvayar is<br />                   not in the list.

<p>                   Maani-k-ka vasagar is perhaps oldest in the list of 63.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, these were glorifications / demonifications to express the stature of the god/demon to common man and not actual genetic mutations,<br /> <br />For example - the halo around the head - is a symbol of wisdom &amp; knowledge.We want our gods to possess all the wisdom and knowledge of the universe right? The thought of a god with poor knowledge or wisdom seems very silly to me. Anyone that sees a god with a halo would easily recognize the wisdom and knowledge...<br /> <br />And we want our gods to be powerful. For this, they should carry powerful weapons all the time. A god being powerful makes man penitent. And the god should possess ornaments of peace and should provide wealth, health, knowledge and freedom from mortal world to the followers... Two hands are not probably enough....<br /> <br />The 10 heads of Ravanan looks like symbolism of terror.<br /> <br />--- On Tue, 9/1/09, Ganesh Kumar (ganeskum) <ganeskum@cisco.com  wrote:</p>

<p>Paavam kannappar. We have been on the same topic for 3 days. So thought will change the subject. </p>
<p>Ravanan with 10heads - myth ?? Why can't it be true ?? Or atleast with multiple heads which could have been exaggerated to 10???</p>
<p>Gene mutation. Today we are seeing many babies being born sticking together. In todays scenario there are lots of people, particularly twins, born together and survive - some have four hands. But if more than 2 go together then chance of survival goes down. But could it be - could it be a reality that such joined-together babies were common those days?? Could it be genemutation (and parinama valarchi) stopped over period of time and here we are the two handed two-legged humans?? May be those brahma (4heads), shanmuga (6headed) ashtabujadurgai (8handed) and ravanas (10 headed) are gene mutations and walked this earth. Pl remember. Pl remember this could sound strangenow but could have been a reality once. Once men used to have long hair (kondai) now leave alone kondai people are getting baldier !! I heard that somewhere in siberia they have discoverd an elephant with horn. And we now believe superstuctures like dinosaur walked this earth. So it could<br />well be a reality that shiva had 4 hands and so could be shanmuga with 6 heads. Also one logical thought - when we created ( uruvagapadhuthumbod hu) gods why would we disfigure them giving 4 heads / 8 hands etc??? Think of the fact when goddesses like lakshmi being worshiped as unparalled beauty, why would they have been given 4 hands. There are multiple ways to describe them if they had to be projected as powerful figures. So did we miss out something in those eons ???</p>
<p>Also facts like sarabeshwar (lion headed), narashima (lion headed), nandi (bull-headed) , kamadenu (cowheaded) -- could it be a fusion between a lion and a half-man turned monkey resulted in some of these avatars ?? If it were imagination of some crazy group of people of a very very ancient world, those people would not have such refined creativity. On the other hand, If amule can happen between horse and donkey today, may be a particular stage of metamorphosis could have allowed such creations to occur.</p>
<p>Just because we don't have proof that it can occur, we cannot dismiss it - atleast till we have a proof that it could not have happened. </p>

<p>Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka ishistory (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor for spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>  History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />  history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />  in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />  several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />  of Gandhi etc.)</p>
<p>  It is preferable not to get swayed or bulldozed by the 'scientific' tag<br />  attached to extrapolated and biased versions of 'history'.</p>

<p>    Hello Vairam</p>
<p>    Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />  the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />  etc).</p>
<p>    Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />    If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />  on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />  Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>    If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />  references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />  control problem irukke?</p>
<p>    Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />  according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />  case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>    Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />  patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />  proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />  to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />  current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />  bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>    Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />  research anyway.</p>
<p>    Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />  survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />  story come by?</p>
<p>    I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />  all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />  sense.</p>
<p>    As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />  Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />  he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />  short cut :-).</p>
<p>    Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />  now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />  Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />    Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />  Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />  say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />  scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>      Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>      you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />      My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />  said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />      It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>      Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />  history.</p>
<p>      But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />  know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>      I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />  had year ago!</p>
<p>      I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />  believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />      Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />  what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />      Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />  against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />  other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />  finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />  welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>      Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />  labyrinth again.</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />  and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />  have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>        However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />  anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />  line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />  similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>        I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />  Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />        Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />  Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />  study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>           He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />  the literature itself.</p>
<p>        For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />  and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />  foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />  not be so.</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />  entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />  Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />  Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>        As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />  adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>        I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />  noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />  Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />  poet.</p>
<p>        Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />  itself makes a mile of difference – the usage of that term, on how a<br />  person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />  literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />  written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>        I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />  location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />  thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />  spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />  there, it is also difficult to prove …it was not there.<br />        Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />  as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />  with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />  southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />  Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />  believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />  question posed before too.</p>
<p>        I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />  avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age –<br />  his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />  there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>        When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />  it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />  the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />  possible.</p>
<p>        Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />  this research?</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />  enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />  experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />  entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>           Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />  are.</p>
<p>        Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />  to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed – purely due to his<br />  dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />  tread.</p>
<p>        However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />  relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>        Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />  literature – just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />  bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />  these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />  awe.</p>
<p>        However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />  even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />        These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />  though many do not agree.</p>

<p>          Hi Ravi,<br />          Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />  in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />  various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />  He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />  research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />          I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />  of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />  Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />  members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />  left in these pages.</p>
<p>            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />  cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />  base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />          Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />  been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />  Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />  knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />  work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />          He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />  claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />  his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />  nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />  Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />  out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />  biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />  <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>          So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />  you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />  your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>                  Kannappar is mentioned by manikkavasagar in tiruvasagam,<br />  while the<br />                  language used by ammai dates her between 2 - 5th C and<br />  not later than that<br />                  for sure.</p>

<p>                   Maani-k-ka vasagar is perhaps oldest in the list of 63.</p>

        <p>Hi; Malathi's right. Ravana's 10 heads was not a mutation nor was it about<br />Thalaiganam. This is a layman's misconception. I cant remember exactly but<br />Cho Ramaswamy gave a truly wonderful explanation in his "Engey Brahamanan".<br />It speaks volumes about the goodness in Ravana.The 10 heads are a depiction<br />for us to visualize all this.<br />Infact this is the stage Cho explains how only Hindu mythology shows the<br />"villian" i.e. Ravana having such good characteristics infact in some<br />characteristics he is spoken on par with Rama.</p>

        <p>Ganesh, the point is not about genetic mutations and whether or not multiple heads are possible. Oddities are possible in any time and age. It is justthat that is not the focus of epics, and the more ordinary way they are presented, the easier it will be for people to focus on the message or spiritual meaning behind it.</p>
<p>In other words, instead of debating if Ravana's parents had kids with genetic mutations and multiple heads it is much easier to percieve Ravana as a highly intelligent scholar perhaps as Venkat said with 10 people's intelligence and yet falls prey to the ego.</p>

<p>  Ravanan with 10heads - myth ?? Why can't it be true ?? Or atleast with multiple heads which could have been exaggerated to 10???</p>
<p>  Gene mutation. Today we are seeing many babies being born sticking together. In todays scenario there are lots of people, particularly twins, born together and survive - some have four hands. But if more than 2 go together then chance of survival goes down. But could it be - could it be a reality that such joined-together babies were common those days?? Could it be genemutation (and parinama valarchi) stopped over period of time and here we arethe two handed two-legged humans?? May be those brahma (4heads), shanmuga (6 headed) ashtabujadurgai (8handed) and ravanas (10 headed) are gene mutations and walked this earth. Pl remember. Pl remember this could sound strange now but could have been a reality once. Once men used to have long hair (kondai) now leave alone kondai people are getting baldier !! I heard that somewhere in siberia they have discoverd an elephant with horn. And we now believe superstuctures like dinosaur walked this earth. So it could well bea reality that shiva had 4 hands and so could be shanmuga with 6 heads. Also one logical thought - when we created ( uruvagapadhuthumbodhu) gods why would we disfigure them giving 4 heads / 8 hands etc??? Think of the fact when goddesses like lakshmi being worshiped as unparalled beauty, why would they have been given 4 hands. There are multiple ways to describe them if they had to be projected as powerful figures. So did we miss out something in those eons ???</p>
<p>  Also facts like sarabeshwar (lion headed), narashima (lion headed), nandi(bull-headed), kamadenu (cowheaded) -- could it be a fusion between a lionand a half-man turned monkey resulted in some of these avatars ?? If it were imagination of some crazy group of people of a very very ancient world, those people would not have such refined creativity. On the other hand, If a mule can happen between horse and donkey today, may be a particular stageof metamorphosis could have allowed such creations to occur.</p>
<p>  Just because we don't have proof that it can occur, we cannot dismiss it - atleast till we have a proof that it could not have happened. </p>

<p>  Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>  Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysicallythe soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor forspiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi', Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous argumentscontinue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>    History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />    history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />    in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />    several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />    of Gandhi etc.)</p>

<p>      Hello Vairam</p>
<p>      Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />    the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />    etc).</p>
<p>      Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />      If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />    on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />    Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>      If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />    references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />    control problem irukke?</p>
<p>      Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />    according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />    case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>      Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />    patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />    proper in its explanations.And historians must have a convincing record<br />    to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />    current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />    bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>      Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />    research anyway.</p>
<p>      Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />    survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />    story come by?</p>
<p>      I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />    all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />    sense.</p>
<p>      As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil(rest his soul), I am in search of<br />    Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />    he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />    short cut :-).</p>
<p>      Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />    now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />    Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />      Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />    Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />    say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />    scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>        Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>        you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />        My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />    said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />        It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>        Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />    history.</p>
<p>        But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />    know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>        I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />    had year ago!</p>
<p>        I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />    believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />        Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />    what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />        Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />    against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />    other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />    finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />    welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>        Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />    labyrinth again.</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />    and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />    have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>          However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />    anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />    line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />    similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>          I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />    Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />          Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />    Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />    study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>             He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />    the literature itself.</p>
<p>          For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />    and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />    foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />    not be so.</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />    entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />    Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />    Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>          As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />    adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>          I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />    noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />    Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />    poet.</p>
<p>          Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />    itself makes a mile of difference ??" the usage of that term, on how a<br />    person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />    literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />    written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>          I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />    location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />    thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />    spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />    there, it is also difficult to prove …it was not there.<br />          Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />    as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />    with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />    southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />    Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />    believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />    question posed before too.</p>
<p>          I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />    avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ??"<br />    his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />    there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>          When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />    it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />    the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />    possible.</p>
<p>          Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />    this research?</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />    enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />    experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />    entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>             Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />    are.</p>
<p>          Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />    to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ??" purely due to his<br />    dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />    tread.</p>
<p>          However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />    relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>          Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />    literature ??" just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />    bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />    these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />    awe.</p>
<p>          However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />    even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />          These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />    though many do not agree.</p>
<p>          PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />    argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;          <br />          - R<br />          --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a> <mailto:ponniyinselvan%40yahoogroups.com  , "vairam99" <vairam@  wrote:</p>
<p>            Hi Ravi,<br />            Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />    in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />    various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />    He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />    research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />            I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />    of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />    Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />    members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />    left in these pages.</p>
<p>              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />    cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />              It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />    base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />            Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />    been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />    Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />    knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />    work - The Eight Anthologies).<br />            He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />    claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />    his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />o<br />    nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />    Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />    out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />    biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />    <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a> <http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html  </p>
<p>            So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />    you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />    your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>                     Maani-k-ka vasagar is perhaps oldest in the list of 63.</p>
