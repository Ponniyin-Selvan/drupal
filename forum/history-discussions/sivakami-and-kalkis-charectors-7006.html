</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Deepa<br />I agree with Pavithra and Malathi<br />Kalkis female charectors are more realistic reflecting the true nature of women and not how men would want their women to be( I know I am stirring a hornets nest here)<br />They are charectors with a strong veiw point like Poonguzhali,Sivakami,Nandhini,KUndavai<seetha etc</p>
<p>However lovesmitten you are you will have differences of opinion if you dont theres something missing...the beauty of love is finding something in common amonst your differences and have a happy life together...I am sure Mamalan nad Sivagami could and would have had a happy life if destiny chose to unite them...thats what happens tpo most of us</p>
<p>I think thats the great charector of Kalki having charectors with pitfalls charectors who change their minds...</p>

<p>true.<br />lucky many publishers have an inherent love for the books and <br />continue in the field inspite of all hazards</p>
<p>you can see this is evident from the many book release functions <br />going on.</p>
<p>Makkal TV has allowed publishers to run banner running ads for their <br />publications during certain programs, but unfortunately I could not <br />even recollect one proper book from the running banners.</p>

<p>  Nanda, in US and UK we see people very excited about Harry Potter <br />  release and queueing up at Book stores to this day. In fact some <br />book <br />  stores exist solely by virtue of Harry Potter.</p>
<p>  Is there anything like that with regards to Tamil books in India? I <br />  don't know but not heard of. My own nieces and nephews give me <br />  strange looks when I even ask about current tamil books. </p>

<p>    Dear Deepa, very good analysis, I think yours and Pavithra's <br />  together <br />    make a superlative study of the Sivakami-Narasimhan relationship <br />  from <br />    different viewpoints. </p>
<p>    Generally speaking, be it in fiction or real life, noone can <br />really <br />    predict how relationships turn out. It is said KrishnaDevaRaya <br />    married a dancer (I forget her name) and their partnership is <br />    believed to have changed the artistic world at that time <br />  completely. <br />    Strong egos are difficult to reconcile but if they do it creates <br />    great change and transformation. But looks like Kalki never <br />  intended <br />    this couple to be married. Venkat mentioned he wrote Parthiban <br />  Kanavu <br />    before SS and he does state in that clearly that they were not. </p>
<p>    So we can continue to debate and discuss this from many angles to <br />  our <br />    heart's content. My mother used to say she used to wake her <br />father <br />  at <br />    2 AM in Trichy to go to railway station on thursdays, while SS <br />was <br />    originally serialised. Guess what, the copies of Kalki would <br />arrive <br />    by train from Chennai at that time. Most copies would be sold <br />  before <br />    they left the station to go to stores. Which author or story can <br />    claim to incite such passions now? Sadly noone.</p>

<p>      Secondly, I do like all the characters in SS.. when they are <br />not <br />      bickering, I do like even Sivakami/Mamallan :) </p>
<p>      I am not questioning Kalki's realism - I know people like that <br />    exist, <br />      even if they are not artists or princes! I am only suggesting <br />  that <br />      they put their ego above their love always - hence, their love <br />  will <br />      never know constancy and peace. As others have pointed out, <br />maybe <br />      thats why Kalki didnt get them married (of course, also to stay <br />    true <br />      to history)</p>
<p>      I was just surprised by the intensity of their bickering.. <br />      some "oodal"/"roothna- manana" is always expected. Probably a <br />bit <br />    more <br />      than normal in this case due to an artist/prince being <br />involved. <br />      Sivakami does have a mercurial nature and Narasimha is like <br />  a "pea <br />    on <br />      a hot shovel" too :) However, their meetings seems to bring out <br />  the <br />      worst in them. </p>
<p>      Remember this scene. Sivakami is captive in Vathapi, forced to <br />    dance <br />      on the streets to save the Pallava prisoners of war. Narasimha <br />    knows <br />      why she is dancing. He comes to rescue her amidst such intense <br />    danger <br />      after a very long journey. They hardly have a few minutes. And <br />  they <br />      choose such a time to bicker, suspect each other and question <br />  their <br />      love for each other - they let their ego come before their <br />love. <br />    And <br />      suffer later.</p>
<p>      Why would you expect this dynamic to stop suppose they had <br />  married? <br />      If Narasimhan, busy with his kingly duties, ignored her, she <br />  would <br />      throw a tantrum. He would, in turn, taunt her. She would always <br />      throw "oru siriya sirpi magal" to him and he would continue <br />  volley <br />      a "moovulagum potrum naattiya rani" to her.. and this would go <br />      on. "oodal"s, which may be fun while courting will definitely <br />be <br />  a <br />      pain when one is trying to rule a kingdom :)</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi,<br /> <br />I am not sure if Tamil readership is actually going down, but the craze of queue-ing up for books is definitely not there. Unfortunately Tamil readers, authors &amp; publishers are being culturally assaulted through marketing programs for English language books. Tamil publishers do not have the financial might to create a market and marketing campaigns to allow them to do it. <br /> <br />Venkatesh can actually quote better than me, I am only giving my perceptionof things in Chennai. Makkal TV has allowed publishers to run banner running ads for their publications during certain programs, but unfortunately I could not even recollect one proper book from the running banners.<br />Regards</p>
<p>Nanda<br /><a href="http://jobdealsinfo.ning.com" title="http://jobdealsinfo.ning.com">http://jobdealsinfo.ning.com</a></p>
<p> <br />Likewise the Tamil publishers presence on the net is very limited. Only sellers have their websites, not publishers.</p>

<p>Nanda, in US and UK we see people very excited about Harry Potter <br />release and queueing up at Book stores to this day. In fact some book <br />stores exist solely by virtue of Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Is there anything like that with regards to Tamil books in India? I <br />don't know but not heard of. My own nieces and nephews give me <br />strange looks when I even ask about current tamil books. </p>

<p>  Dear Deepa, very good analysis, I think yours and Pavithra's <br />together <br />  make a superlative study of the Sivakami-Narasimhan relationship <br />from <br />  different viewpoints. </p>
<p>  Generally speaking, be it in fiction or real life, noone can really <br />  predict how relationships turn out. It is said KrishnaDevaRaya <br />  married a dancer (I forget her name) and their partnership is <br />  believed to have changed the artistic world at that time <br />completely. <br />  Strong egos are difficult to reconcile but if they do it creates <br />  great change and transformation. But looks like Kalki never <br />intended <br />  this couple to be married. Venkat mentioned he wrote Parthiban <br />Kanavu <br />  before SS and he does state in that clearly that they were not. </p>
<p>  So we can continue to debate and discuss this from many angles to <br />our <br />  heart's content. My mother used to say she used to wake her father <br />at <br />  2 AM in Trichy to go to railway station on thursdays, while SS was <br />  originally serialised. Guess what, the copies of Kalki would arrive <br />  by train from Chennai at that time. Most copies would be sold <br />before <br />  they left the station to go to stores. Which author or story can <br />  claim to incite such passions now? Sadly noone.</p>

<p>    Hi Malathi<br />    as a publisher i would be able to tell you this.<br />    the last 5 years or so is perhaps one of the best periods for <br />tamil <br />    publishing.<br />    more people are reading these days.<br />    more publishers are entering the field.<br />    hopefully it would remain like that for some more time.</p>
<p>    if you want to compare english books with tamil ones its like <br />    comparing a hollywood movie to a tamil one in terms of investment <br />  and <br />    market.<br />    the english market is huge.<br />    there are publishers in india who just thrive on english <br />  translations <br />    of regional language books. example 'katha'<br />    they do extremely well- better than many regional language book <br />    publishers.</p>

"oodal"s, which may be fun while courting will <br />definitely <br />    be <br />      a <br />          pain when one is trying to rule a kingdom :)</p>

<p>      Dear Deepa, very good analysis, I think yours and Pavithra's <br />    together <br />      make a superlative study of the Sivakami-Narasimhan <br />relationship <br />    from <br />      different viewpoints. </p>
<p>      Generally speaking, be it in fiction or real life, noone can <br />  really <br />      predict how relationships turn out. It is said KrishnaDevaRaya <br />      married a dancer (I forget her name) and their partnership is <br />      believed to have changed the artistic world at that time <br />    completely. <br />      Strong egos are difficult to reconcile but if they do it <br />creates <br />      great change and transformation. But looks like Kalki never <br />    intended <br />      this couple to be married. Venkat mentioned he wrote Parthiban <br />    Kanavu <br />      before SS and he does state in that clearly that they were not. </p>
<p>      So we can continue to debate and discuss this from many angles <br />to <br />    our <br />      heart's content. My mother used to say she used to wake her <br />  father <br />    at <br />      2 AM in Trichy to go to railway station on thursdays, while SS <br />  was <br />      originally serialised. Guess what, the copies of Kalki would <br />  arrive <br />      by train from Chennai at that time. Most copies would be sold <br />    before <br />      they left the station to go to stores. Which author or story <br />can <br />      claim to incite such passions now? Sadly noone.</p>

        <p>Nanda, in US and UK we see people very excited about Harry Potter <br />release and queueing up at Book stores to this day. In fact some book <br />stores exist solely by virtue of Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Is there anything like that with regards to Tamil books in India? I <br />don't know but not heard of. My own nieces and nephews give me <br />strange looks when I even ask about current tamil books. </p>

<p>  Dear Deepa, very good analysis, I think yours and Pavithra's <br />together <br />  make a superlative study of the Sivakami-Narasimhan relationship <br />from <br />  different viewpoints. </p>
<p>  Generally speaking, be it in fiction or real life, noone can really <br />  predict how relationships turn out. It is said KrishnaDevaRaya <br />  married a dancer (I forget her name) and their partnership is <br />  believed to have changed the artistic world at that time <br />completely. <br />  Strong egos are difficult to reconcile but if they do it creates <br />  great change and transformation. But looks like Kalki never <br />intended <br />  this couple to be married. Venkat mentioned he wrote Parthiban <br />Kanavu <br />  before SS and he does state in that clearly that they were not. </p>
<p>  So we can continue to debate and discuss this from many angles to <br />our <br />  heart's content. My mother used to say she used to wake her father <br />at <br />  2 AM in Trichy to go to railway station on thursdays, while SS was <br />  originally serialised. Guess what, the copies of Kalki would arrive <br />  by train from Chennai at that time. Most copies would be sold <br />before <br />  they left the station to go to stores. Which author or story can <br />  claim to incite such passions now? Sadly noone.</p>

<p>    Sri/Malathy et al<br />    Firstly, if you see my original email, I never put the blame only <br />  on <br />    Sivakami. My comment was not about how women should be, etc. <br />    (personally, the stronger the heroines, the better i like them)</p>
<p>    Secondly, I do like all the characters in SS.. when they are not <br />    bickering, I do like even Sivakami/Mamallan :) </p>
<p>    I am not questioning Kalki's realism - I know people like that <br />  exist, <br />    even if they are not artists or princes! I am only suggesting <br />that <br />    they put their ego above their love always - hence, their love <br />will <br />    never know constancy and peace. As others have pointed out, maybe <br />    thats why Kalki didnt get them married (of course, also to stay <br />  true <br />    to history)</p>
<p>    I was just surprised by the intensity of their bickering.. <br />    some "oodal"/"roothna- manana" is always expected. Probably a bit <br />  more <br />    than normal in this case due to an artist/prince being involved. <br />    Sivakami does have a mercurial nature and Narasimha is like <br />a "pea <br />  on <br />    a hot shovel" too :) However, their meetings seems to bring out <br />the <br />    worst in them. </p>
<p>    Remember this scene. Sivakami is captive in Vathapi, forced to <br />  dance <br />    on the streets to save the Pallava prisoners of war. Narasimha <br />  knows <br />    why she is dancing. He comes to rescue her amidst such intense <br />  danger <br />    after a very long journey. They hardly have a few minutes. And <br />they <br />    choose such a time to bicker, suspect each other and question <br />their <br />    love for each other - they let their ego come before their love. <br />  And <br />    suffer later.</p>
<p>    Why would you expect this dynamic to stop suppose they had <br />married? <br />    If Narasimhan, busy with his kingly duties, ignored her, she <br />would <br />    throw a tantrum. He would, in turn, taunt her. She would always <br />    throw "oru siriya sirpi magal" to him and he would continue <br />volley <br />    a "moovulagum potrum naattiya rani" to her.. and this would go <br />    on. "oodal"s, which may be fun while courting will definitely be <br />a <br />    pain when one is trying to rule a kingdom :)</p>
<p>    Anyway, sorry for lengthening this discussion. Will stop now!<br />    Deepa</p>

          Sivakami and Kalkis charectors        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Given their charecterstics, i am not sure what would have happened if <br />they had been married.</p>
<p>Sivakami was a free spirit and so was narasimha. If they had been <br />married it would have been difficult for sivakami to be without <br />dancing and pattathu rani in kolu mandapam dancing for visitors et <br />all, may not have been a bright prospect.</p>
<p>Kalki talks about her nuturing that aspect, when Naganandhi poisons <br />her mind against the 'bayam kolli pallavan', her artist frame takes <br />over, one must read those pages to feel like how it is to be a <br />performer of any art, only Kalki can do justice to those immortal <br />words about Sivakami's mind display.</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "deepabhaskaran" <br /><deepabhaskaran@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Sri/Malathy et al<br />  Firstly, if you see my original email, I never put the blame only <br />on <br />  Sivakami. My comment was not about how women should be, etc. <br />  (personally, the stronger the heroines, the better i like them)</p>
<p>  Secondly, I do like all the characters in SS.. when they are not <br />  bickering, I do like even Sivakami/Mamallan :) </p>
<p>  I am not questioning Kalki's realism - I know people like that <br />exist, <br />  even if they are not artists or princes! I am only suggesting that <br />  they put their ego above their love always - hence, their love will <br />  never know constancy and peace. As others have pointed out, maybe <br />  thats why Kalki didnt get them married (of course, also to stay <br />true <br />  to history)</p>
<p>  I was just surprised by the intensity of their bickering.. <br />  some "oodal"/"roothna-manana" is always expected. Probably a bit <br />more <br />  than normal in this case due to an artist/prince being involved. <br />  Sivakami does have a mercurial nature and Narasimha is like a "pea <br />on <br />  a hot shovel" too :) However, their meetings seems to bring out the <br />  worst in them. </p>
<p>  Remember this scene. Sivakami is captive in Vathapi, forced to <br />dance <br />  on the streets to save the Pallava prisoners of war. Narasimha <br />knows <br />  why she is dancing. He comes to rescue her amidst such intense <br />danger <br />  after a very long journey. They hardly have a few minutes. And they <br />  choose such a time to bicker, suspect each other and question their <br />  love for each other - they let their ego come before their love. <br />And <br />  suffer later.</p>
<p>  Why would you expect this dynamic to stop suppose they had married? <br />  If Narasimhan, busy with his kingly duties, ignored her, she would <br />  throw a tantrum. He would, in turn, taunt her. She would always <br />  throw "oru siriya sirpi magal" to him and he would continue volley <br />  a "moovulagum potrum naattiya rani" to her.. and this would go <br />  on. "oodal"s, which may be fun while courting will definitely be a <br />  pain when one is trying to rule a kingdom :)</p>
<p>  Anyway, sorry for lengthening this discussion. Will stop now!<br />  Deepa</p>
