<p>If one goes through the replies of the person aged about 56 to <br />various questions, the concentration is more on Love / Women / <br />Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>Any further discussion on this will only drag us out of scope of our <br />main line of communications ...</p>
<p>There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman - at Thillaisthanam <br />(near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting Social Novels with <br />Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu Vaanam" in mid <br />70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa ... forerunner for <br />titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc. </p>
<p>I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in touch all these years ..</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are about 40 names to <br />Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found the most enchanting <br />name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  himself could not <br />find!</acronym></p>

<p>I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her opinions. We can't say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is wrong (that is my own view of course) but at the same time I also believe he has every right to his opinion. Who was it who said that "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"? Or words to that effect.. </p>
<p>I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of Googling got me this :</p>
<p>This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely attributed to the French writer Voltaire, that master of liberal philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. Fran?ois-Marie Arouet ( Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to England. <br />But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment you quote. According to a number of web sites, "The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's words in his "Treatise on Toleration," which includes such thoughts as: <br />Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,</p>

<p>Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />shouldn't have saying "not considered <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is not<br />historic novel" when <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is completely based on <br />historic facts.

<p>Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to <br />disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.</p>
<p>Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />arrogant.</p>
<p>So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />mass opinion.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  Ok here's my tuppence worth. PS is a work of<br />  historical fiction. No one can<br />  refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />  like that, it is either<br />  out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />  or out of arrogance<br />  (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />  have to realize that he<br />  is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />  If we all love PS and<br />  Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />  disagrees with us or<br />  disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />  his opinion, just as the<br />  fact that we think PS is good is just our opinion. <br />  Also, one doesn't need to<br />  be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />  Ganguly now, ! does one? Or be<br />  a politician to comment on politics. :-) Similarly,<br />  IMHO, one does not need<br />  to be a great writer to critique novels.</p>

<p>    I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />  mail.</p>
<p>    If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />  about 56 to<br />    various questions, the concentration is more on<br />  Love / Women /<br />    Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>    Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />  out of scope of our<br />    main line of communications ...</p>
<p>    There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />  - at Thillaisthanam <br />    (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />  Social Novels with<br />    Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />  Vaanam" in mid<br />    70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa! <br />  ... forerunner for<br />    titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>    I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />  touch all these years ..</p>
<p>    As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />  about 40 names to<br />    Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />  the most enchanting<br />    name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />  himself could not<br />    find! </p>
<p>    Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />  first .. then they<br />    comment on acknowledged ones ..</p>

<p>I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her opinions. We can't say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is wrong (that is my own view of course) but at the same time I also believe he has every right to his opinion. Who was it who said that "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"? Or words to that effect.. </p>
<p>I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of Googling got me this :</p>
<p>This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely attributed to the French writer Voltaire, that master of liberal philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. Fran?ois-Marie Arouet ( Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to England. <br />But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment you quote.

<p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her opinions. We can't<br />say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his<br />opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is wrong (that is my own view of<br />course) but at the same time I also believe he has every right to his<br />opinion. Who was it who said that "I disapprove of what you say, but I will<br />defend to the death your right to say it"? Or words to that effect.. </p>
<p>I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of Googling got me this :</p>
<p>This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely<br />attributed to the French writer Voltaire<br /><http://education.yahoo.com/search/be?lb=t&amp;p=url%3Av/voltaire  , that master<br />of liberal philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. Fran?ois-Marie<br /><http://www.malaspina.com/site/person_500.asp  Arouet (<br /><http://dir.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/Philosophy/Philosophers/Voltaire__1694<br />_1778_/  Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated<br />writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment<br /><http://education.yahoo.com/search/be?lb=t&amp;p=url%3Ae/enlightenment  . His<br />tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to<br />established views, and his biting commentaries twice led to his<br />imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to England. </http://education.yahoo.com/search/be?lb=t&amp;p=url%3ae/enlightenment></http://dir.yahoo.com/arts/humanities/philosophy/philosophers/voltaire__1694<br></http://www.malaspina.com/site/person_500.asp></http://education.yahoo.com/search/be?lb=t&amp;p=url%3av/voltaire></p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment<br />you quote. According to a number of web sites<br /><http://www.classroomtools.com/voltaire.htm  , "The phrase was invented by a<br />later author as an epitome of his attitude." It comes from The Friends of<br />Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and published in 1906 under the<br />pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's<br />words in his "<br /><http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/virtual/reading/core4-05r03.htm <br />Treatise on Toleration," which includes such thoughts as: </http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/virtual/reading/core4-05r03.htm></http://www.classroomtools.com/voltaire.htm></p>
<p>Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do<br />not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous<br />to declare their eternal damnation.</p>

<p>Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />arrogant.</p>
<p>So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />mass opinion.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  Ok here's my tuppence worth. PS is a work of<br />  historical fiction. No one can<br />  refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />  like that, it is either<br />  out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />  or out of arrogance<br />  (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />  have to realize that he<br />  is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />  If we all love PS and<br />  Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />  disagrees with us or<br />  disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />  his opinion, just as the<br />  fact that we think PS is good is just our opinion. <br />  Also, one doesn't need to<br />  be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />  Ganguly now, ! does one? Or be<br />  a politician to comment on politics. :-) Similarly,<br />  IMHO, one does not need<br />  to be a great writer to critique novels.</p>

<p>      ====================<br />    Dear Sridhar,</p>
<p>    I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />  mail.</p>
<p>    If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />  about 56 to<br />    various questions, the concentration is more on<br />  Love / Women /<br />    Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>    Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />  out of scope of our<br />    main line of communications ...</p>
<p>    There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />  - at Thillaisthanam <br />    (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />  Social Novels with<br />    Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />  Vaanam" in mid<br />    70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa! <br />  ... forerunner for<br />    titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>    I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />  touch all these years ..</p>
<p>    As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />  about 40 names to<br />    Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />  the most enchanting<br />    name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />  himself could not<br />    find! </p>
<p>    Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />  first .. then they<br />    comment on acknowledged ones ..</p>

<p>I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her opinions. We can't say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is wrong (that is my own view of course) but at the same time I also believe he has every right to his opinion. Who was it who said that "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"? Or words to that effect.. </p>
<p>I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of Googling got me this :</p>
<p>This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely attributed to the French writer Voltaire, that master of liberal philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. Fran?ois-Marie Arouet ( Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to England. <br />But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment you quote. According to a number of web sites, "The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's words in his "Treatise on Toleration," which includes such thoughts as: <br />Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,</p>

<p>Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />shouldn't have saying "not considered <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is not<br />historic novel" when <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is completely based on <br />historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to <br />disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.</p>
<p>Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />arrogant.</p>
<p>So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />mass opinion.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  Ok here's my tuppence worth. PS is a work of<br />  historical fiction. No one can<br />  refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />  like that, it is either<br />  out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />  or out of arrogance<br />  (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />  have to realize that he<br />  is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />  If we all love PS and<br />  Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />  disagrees with us or<br />  disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />  his opinion, just as the<br />  fact that we think PS is good is just our opinion. <br />  Also, one doesn't need to<br />  be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />  Ganguly now, does one?

<p>I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her opinions. We can't say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his opinions.. and I do..

<p>I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of Googling got me this :</p>
<p>This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely attributed to the French writer Voltaire, that master of liberal philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. Fran?ois-Marie Arouet ( Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to England. <br />But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment you quote. According to a number of web sites, "The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's words in his "Treatise on Toleration," which includes such thoughts as: <br />Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,</p>

<p>Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to <br />disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.</p>
<p>Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />arrogant.</p>
<p>So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />mass opinion.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  Ok here's my tuppence worth. PS is a work of<br />  historical fiction. No one can<br />  refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />  like that, it is either<br />  out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />  or out of arrogance<br />  (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />  have to realize that he<br />  is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />  If we all love PS and<br />  Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />  disagrees with us or<br />  disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />  his opinion, just as the<br />  fact that we think PS is good is just our opinion. <br />  Also, one doesn't need to<br />  be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />  Ganguly now, does one? Or be<br />  a politician to comment on politics. :-) Similarly,<br />  IMHO, one does not need<br />  to be a great writer to critique novels.</p>

<p>    I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />  mail.</p>
<p>    If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />  about 56 to<br />    various questions, the concentration is more on<br />  Love / Women /<br />    Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>    Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />  out of scope of our<br />    main line of communications ...</p>
<p>    There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />  - at Thillaisthanam <br />    (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />  Social Novels with<br />    Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />  Vaanam" in mid<br />    70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa <br />  ... forerunner for<br />    titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>    I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />  touch all these years ..</p>
<p>    As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />  about 40 names to<br />    Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />  the most enchanting<br />    name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />  himself could not<br />    find! </p>
<p>    Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />  first .. then they<br />    comment on acknowledged ones ..</p>

          Ponniyin selvan - prabanchan        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I just had a rapid glimpse of the discussion. Have couple of thoughts <br />on it, </p>
<p>1) History is an ever growing field, with advances in <br />anthropology/archaelogy and epigraphic evidences shed more light over <br />it, we find lot of things we thought was history being proved wrong.</p>
<p>So if we are to judge <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  by historical factuality, we have to take <br />into consideration the availability of sources at the time kalki <br />wrote it.</acronym></p>
<p>2) Another blame on historical fiction is that they focus too much on <br />kings and less on cabbages. Love and war are the primary ingrediants. </p>
<p>Again <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is a groundbreaking work in that aspect too. In fact <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  has <br />some many enjoyable down to earth daily routine info/imaginations like<br />Vandiyadevan's repast at Sendan Amuthan's place " Thengai paalum, <br />idiyappamum vayir mutta undaan..". Though I do enjoy other authors <br />are Candilyan, this is one of the hall marks of Kalki.</acronym></p>
<p>Points and Counter points apart.</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  has a hallowed place not just because it is a good literature, but <br />because it inspired thousands to know thier history and inspired <br />historical explorations and other literary works and what not.</acronym></p>
<p>So irrespective of factuality or belonging to any genre. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is a <br />phenomenon.</acronym></p>
<p>However Prabanchan's perspective may not be the same, being a creator <br />in his own right, it is innate in him to challenge the existing order.</p>

<p>  Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />  shouldn't have saying "not considered PS is not<br />  historic novel" when PS is completely based on <br />  historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />  Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />  Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".</p>
<p>  Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to <br />  disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />  writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.</p>
<p>  Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />  doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />  world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />  arrogant.</p>
<p>  So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />  mass opinion.</p>

<p>    Dear All,</p>
<p>    Ok here's my tuppence worth. PS is a work of<br />    historical fiction. No one can<br />    refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something <br />    like that, it is either<br />    out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />    or out of arrogance<br />    (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />    have to realize that he<br />    is entitled to his views just the same as all of us. <br />    If we all love PS and<br />    Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />    disagrees with us or<br />    disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />    his opinion, just as the<br />    fact that we think PS is good is just our opinion. <br />    Also, one doesn't need to<br />    be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />    Ganguly now, does one? Or be<br />    a politician to comment on politics. :-) Similarly,<br />    IMHO, one does not need<br />    to be a great writer to critique novels.</p>

<p>        ====================<br />      Dear Sridhar,</p>
<p>      I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />    mail.</p>
<p>      If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />    about 56 to<br />      various questions, the concentration is more on<br />    Love / Women /<br />      Actressess and the alike..</p>
<p>      Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />    out of scope of our<br />      main line of communications ...</p>
<p>      There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />    - at Thillaisthanam <br />      (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />    Social Novels with<br />      Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />    Vaanam" in mid<br />      70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa <br />    ... forerunner for<br />      titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>      I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />    touch all these years ..</p>
<p>      As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />    about 40 names to<br />      Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />    the most enchanting<br />      name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />    himself could not<br />      find! </p>
<p>      Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />    first .. then they<br />      comment on acknowledged ones ..</p>

        <p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>I agree with you that people should be able to express<br />their opinions. In my view, his opinion was basically<br />regarding what is a historic novel. What Prabhanjan<br />did was to redefine in his own way a commonly<br />understood term , "historic novel". The justification<br />he provides (common man ...) is not convincing. He<br />did not criticise <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , but the way people use the term<br />"historic novel". In his world, all such novels are<br />called by some other name. I guess he does have a<br />contorted view of the world.</acronym></p>

<p>Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole <br />world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />arrogant.</p>
<p>So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />mass opinion.</p>

<p>    There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />  - at Thillaisthanam <br />    (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />  Social Novels with<br />    Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />  Vaanam" in mid<br />    70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa <br />  ... forerunner for<br />    titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>
<p>    I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />  touch all these years ..</p>
<p>    As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are <br />  about 40 names to<br />    Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />  the most enchanting<br />    name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which RR<br />  himself could not<br />    find! </p>

        <p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her opinions. We can't <br />say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his <br />opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is wrong (that is my own view of <br />course) but at the same time I also believe he has every right to his <br />opinion. Who was it who said that "*I disapprove of what you say, but I will <br />defend to the death your right to say it*"? Or words to that effect.. </p>
<p>I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of Googling got me this :</p>
<p>This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely <br />attributed to the French writer<br />Voltaire<http://education.yahoo.com/search/be?lb=t&amp;p=url%3Av/voltaire ,<br />that master of liberal philosophy renowned for *his* satirical wit.<br />Fran?ois-Marie<br />Arouet <http://www.malaspina.com/site/person_500.asp <br />(Voltaire<http://dir.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/Philosophy/Philosophers/Voltaire__1694_1778_/ was<br />*his* nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the <br />18th-century intellectual movement known as the<br />Enlightenment<http://education.yahoo.com/search/be?lb=t&amp;p=url%3Ae/enlightenment .<br />*His* tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to <br />established views, and *his* biting commentaries twice led to<br />*his*imprisonment, and eventually, to<br />*his* exile to England. </http://education.yahoo.com/search/be?lb=t&amp;p=url%3ae/enlightenment></http://dir.yahoo.com/arts/humanities/philosophy/philosophers/voltaire__1694_1778_/></http://www.malaspina.com/site/person_500.asp></http://education.yahoo.com/search/be?lb=t&amp;p=url%3av/voltaire></p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment <br />you quote. According to a number of web<br />sites<http://www.classroomtools.com/voltaire.htm ,<br />"The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of *his* attitude." <br />It comes from *The Friends of Voltaire*, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and <br />published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that <br />she paraphrased Voltaire's words in *his* "*Treatise on<br />Toleration*<http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/virtual/reading/core4-05r03.htm ,"<br />which includes such thoughts as: </http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/virtual/reading/core4-05r03.htm></http://www.classroomtools.com/voltaire.htm></p>
<p>Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do <br />not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous <br />to declare their eternal damnation.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>  Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />  shouldn't have saying "not considered PS is not<br />  historic novel" when PS is completely based on<br />  historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />  Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />  Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Kalki's <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is not complete fiction. He mixed fictious<br />character along with historical facts made <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .</p>
<p>Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />shouldn't have saying "not considered <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is not<br />historic novel" when <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is completely based on<br />historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to<br />disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.</p>
<p>Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole<br />world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />arrogant.</p>
<p>So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the <br />mass opinion.</p>

<p>    There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />  - at Thillaisthanam<br />    (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />  Social Novels with<br />    Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />  Vaanam" in mid<br />    70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa<br />  ... forerunner for<br />    titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.</p>

<p>Like someone said: Opinions are like Ass*****. Everybody has one! :-p <br />(*Tongue firmly in cheek*)</p>
