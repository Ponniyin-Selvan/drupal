<blockquote><p>  During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the Aye<br />  dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a<br />  military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur Salai<br />  which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced great<br />  trained warriors.</p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines of<br />  these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera<br />(Kerala)<br />  country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an<br />  absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern region of<br />  the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull kings.</p>
<p>  Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />  A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />  acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again<br />  in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military<br />  acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>  This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the<br />  year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military<br />  acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of<br />  Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />Vilignam.</p>
<p>  The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The <br />Rajaraja<br />  Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village called<br />  Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />  Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>  Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants in <br />the<br />  year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi <br />(October/November)<br />  a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />  nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the God <br />at<br />  the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river and a<br />  perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p></blockquote>

<p>  A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY ON MEDIEVAL CHOLAS<br />  AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE CHERAS {KERALAS} OF THE CONTEMPORARY<br />  PERIOD {A.D.801 - A.D 1120}</p>
<p>  Introduction</p>
<p>  During the periods of the nineth and the tenth centuries, the Chera<br />  country was ruled by three principal royal dynasties known as the<br />  Ayes, Venads and Kulasekaras from three distinctive regions of <br />Kerala<br />  (the Sanskritised version of Chera), and the kings of these three<br />  dynasties and the other Chieftains ruling small regions of rest of<br />  the Kerala, all were generally referred to as the Cheras or Keralas<br />  by the people of Chola &amp; Pandiya countries of this period.</p>
<p>  The Aye dynasty were ruling a region covering from the present<br />  Nagerkoil of Tamil Nadu the southern end of the Aye kingdom, <br />upwards<br />  into Kerala to the present Anjuthengu in the north of the present<br />  Thiruvananthapuram, and was known as Aye Nadu. Their capital was at<br />  Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye Nadu<br />  also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic studies<br />  acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was located <br />deep<br />  south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to Nagerkoil <br />the<br />  southern end of the Aye kingdom.</p>
<p>  The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu covering a<br />  region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as Kollam<br />  Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport city on<br />  the west Kerala.</p>
<p>  The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond <br />Kottayam<br />  further north upto and around the present region of Kolikkodu<br />  (Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital at<br />  Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as Makothai, <br />and<br />  a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu country of<br />  that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil Nadu,<br />  bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under their<br />  rule during this period.</p>
<p>  Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory ruled by<br />  Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" under<br />  different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who <br />accepted<br />  the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their respective<br />  regions as subordinates to them.</p>
<p>  The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya Chola</p>
<p>  Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a <br />powerful<br />  Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in<br />  Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country covering the length of the <br />  Kolli -<br />  Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his capital<br />  at Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>  He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />  nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur (the<br />  Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the <br />Pandiya<br />  country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably during<br />  this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the Kulasekara<br />  dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to rule <br />over<br />  this region.</p>
<p>  Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as an<br />  incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of this <br />period<br />  referred to him as Kulasekara Perumal in reverence.</p>
<p>  He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in Cholanadu, and<br />  Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, and has<br />  composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu named<br />  as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda Mala". He<br />  abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was venerated as<br />  one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the<br />  Kulasekara Alvar.</p>
<p>  The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. With<br />  the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son Rajasekaran<br />  {A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was also <br />known<br />  by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an ardent<br />  devotee of God Siva.</p>
<p>  Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram spent<br />  most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at the<br />  Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) in <br />the<br />  Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great Tamil <br />Saiva<br />  Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a pilgrimage <br />to<br />  the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera king<br />  Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva <br />Saint,<br />  also went to Thiruvarur at this same time.</p>
<p>  Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera king<br />  composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as "Mummanikkovai". From<br />  there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar to <br />the<br />  Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other Siva<br />  Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further hyms in<br />  Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponnvanna Anthathi"<br />  and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and venerated<br />  as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by him <br />have<br />  been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a<br />  collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by various<br />  Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala State).</p>
<p>  Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar the<br />  Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the palace <br />of<br />  this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the Chera<br />  country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam<br />  (Udagai) region of TamilNadu.</p>
<p>  While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar died.<br />  Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the<br />  Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in the<br />  same year.</p>
<p>  It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and partly<br />  during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great Saiva<br />  Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who <br />founded<br />  the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala.</p>
<p>  It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal from<br />  Venad in the Chera country though not classified under the sixty-<br />  three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by him<br />  named `Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola country,<br />  has been included in the nineth Thirumurai. It appears the Venattu<br />  Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the<br />  Sundaramurthi Nayanar.</p>
<p>  The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was <br />followed<br />  by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma Kulasekaran (alias<br />  Ko-Kandan) (A.D.844 - 885) on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram.<br />  Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had a daughter by<br />  the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva from another<br />  Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala.</p>
<p>  It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, the <br />Chola<br />  dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in partial <br />or<br />  total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for nearly six<br />  centuries.</p>
<p>  Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}</p>
<p>  The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into <br />prominance<br />  was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}, who ruled the Chola<br />  country from Thanjavur.</p>
<p>  It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very friendly<br />  relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his daughter<br />  both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good relations<br />  that existed with the Chola country, had made their endowments to <br />the<br />  Siva temples in the Chola country</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu Ravi<br />  also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravarti Kulasekaradeva, the<br />  villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named Satanur <br />in<br />  the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as Tiruayanisuramudaiya<br />  Nayanar.</p>
<p>  The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the temple <br />of<br />  Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) in the<br />  year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu Ravi <br />also<br />  gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in<br />  Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870.</p>
<p>  Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907}</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his son<br />  Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, who <br />was<br />  a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of his <br />rule<br />  the Athitha Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the Chera king<br />  Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king.</p>
<p>  A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was greatly<br />  instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was rewarded<br />  jointly by the Chola &amp; Chera kings with a crown, palace, elephants,<br />  royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan Thamil <br />Verl".</p>
<p>  Towards the middle of Athitha Chola's rule the Chera king Sthani <br />Ravi<br />  died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara{A.D.885-917} on the<br />  Chera throne.</p>
<p>  During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan <br />(A.D.860-<br />  905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to them was<br />  born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920).</p>
<p>  Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907-953}</p>
<p>  Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-<br />953)<br />  on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan Adigal<br />  daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. He <br />also<br />  married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />  Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the <br />present<br />  Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a further<br />  queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of the <br />Venad<br />  King of the Chera country, who refer themselves as "Villavar'.</p>
<p>  Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named<br />  Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a younger <br />son<br />  by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan.</p>
<p>  A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named Velankumaran<br />  was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the Prince<br />  Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu.</p>
<p>  Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the Pandiyanadu <br />waged<br />  war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera king Rama<br />  Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha.</p>
<p>  Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the<br />  assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with Paranthaha and<br />  his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma at<br />  Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in Sri<br />  Lanka.</p>
<p>  As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri Lankan<br />  king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, returned to <br />the<br />  Chera Country of his mother.</p>
<p>  The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the foremost <br />among<br />  the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara dynasty,<br />  paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween these <br />two<br />  countries to increase many folds. During this period there seems to<br />  have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola<br />  country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king.</p>
<p>  The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the queen of<br />  Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for lighting<br />  lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year A.D.923.</p>
<p>  In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-arisilar Kumaran a native of the<br />  Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala country<br />  gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in<br />  Kudumiyam\nmalai in Cholanadu</p>
<p>  In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of Malainadu<br />  gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in <br />Cholanadu.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold for<br />  lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in Thanjavur.</p>
<p>  She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named<br />  Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During her <br />time<br />  a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present <br />Pondicherry)<br />  and named after her as Kokkilanadi-pereri in Chola country.</p>
<p>  There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala <br />Kurumban<br />  given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha Chola with <br />the<br />  title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts to the the<br />  temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king<br />  Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier Chera <br />king<br />  Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for <br />lighting<br />  lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in Thondainadu<br />  which was under Chola rule.</p>
<p>  Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu<br />  (Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated a <br />lamp<br />  to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince<br />  Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone temple <br />to<br />  Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in <br />Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>  Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at Thirumalpuram <br />in<br />  Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of Kodungolur<br />  (Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948.</p>
<p>  Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the<br />  presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur <br />A.D.952</p>
<p>  Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama Varma, the<br />  king Kothai Ravi Varma{A.D.917-947} succeeded on the Chera throne <br />at<br />  Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country.</p>
<p>  After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by<br />  Indukotha Varma{A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>  Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957}</p>
<p>  After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola <br />(A.D..950-<br />  957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with<br />  Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king his<br />  thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious life,<br />  and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil known<br />  as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the nineth<br />  Thirumurai.)</p>
<p>  Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957}</p>
<p>  He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded to <br />the<br />  Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king the<br />  Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar.</p>
<p>  Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970}</p>
<p>  With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the Sundera <br />Chola<br />  ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the <br />Malaiyaman<br />  king of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar<br />  Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias Thiribhuvanamatheviyar and<br />  also Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and to the<br />  former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1.</p>
<p>  During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was succeeded by<br />  Bhaskara Ravi Varma -1{A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. Baskara Ravi<br />  Varma - 2{A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted Bhakara Ravi <br />Varma ?<br />  1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which stretched from the present<br />  Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region encompassing the Kudamalainadu,<br />  Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-regent probably from Uthahai in the<br />  Kongu region which was under the Chera rule during this period.</p>
<p>  Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985}</p>
<p>  After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 was the<br />  legitimate heir to the Chola throne, but he whole heartedly gave <br />way<br />  to Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola being<br />  his paternal uncle to rule for some period.</p>
<p>  Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named Panchavanmatheviyar <br />who<br />  was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar known as Kandan<br />  Sundera Cholan.</p>
<p>  Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014}</p>
<p>  Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by the <br />heir<br />  apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D.985-1014} on the Chola throne.</p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman king of<br />  Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was also as<br />  Thiribhuvanamadevi.</p>
<p>  One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi the daughter of the <br />king<br />  of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a queen known as<br />  Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />  Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west of Thirutchirappalli<br />  bordering Kerala state. It was to this Vanavanmadevi the greatest<br />  emperor in the Chola history namely the Rajendra Chola ? 1 was <br />born.</p>
<p>  With the accession of Rajaraja Chola-1 on the Chola throne and with<br />  his imperialistic ambitions over South India, found that it was<br />  necessary initially to overcome the powerfull Cheras.</p>
<p>  During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the Aye<br />  dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a<br />  military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur Salai<br />  which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced great<br />  trained warriors.</p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines of<br />  these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera<br />(Kerala)<br />  country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an<br />  absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern region of<br />  the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull kings.</p>
<p>  Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />  A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />  acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again<br />  in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military<br />  acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>  This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the<br />  year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military<br />  acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of<br />  Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />Vilignam.</p>
<p>  The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The <br />Rajaraja<br />  Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village called<br />  Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />  Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>  Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants in <br />the<br />  year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi <br />(October/November)<br />  a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />  nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the God <br />at<br />  the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river and a<br />  perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p>
<p>  He now turned his attention on his conquest of the territories in <br />the<br />  Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the <br />present<br />  Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja-1 thereafter sent an ambassador to <br />the<br />  co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of Mahodai ruling from<br />  Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as Udagai), namely <br />Baskara<br />  Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the family of Kulasekaras,<br />  requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty and to pay tributes.</p>
<p>  The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of <br />Uthahai<br />  and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja Chola-1 <br />who<br />  sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year A.D.1014<br />  which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears <br />Baskara<br />  Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu was controlled by <br />Cholas.</p>
<p>  The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the north and<br />  central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara Ravivarman<br />  Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the<br />  Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram<br />  (Kodungolur). It appears Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 too accepted the<br />  Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in the<br />  Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the territories of<br />  Chera country ruled by the other chieftans which were under Baskara<br />  Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy.</p>
<p>  The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory <br />(Kolladesam)<br />  and captured the the region along with its seaport capital the <br />Kollam<br />  (proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain Govardhana<br />  Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the<br />  Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu.</p>
<p>  Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044}</p>
<p>  Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was succeeeded by<br />  his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a co-<br />  regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012.</p>
<p>  During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year A.D.1019, with<br />  the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 of<br />  Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his second<br />  son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who <br />defeated<br />  the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital Mahothai<br />  and secured his crown, diadem and an island called Santhimathivu<br />  belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic sea. In this <br />war<br />  Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death.</p>
<p>  With the his securing of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? 1<br />  assumed the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 gave <br />the<br />  title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and <br />appointed<br />  him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu of the<br />  Kerala country.</p>
<p>  However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war expedition<br />  with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera <br />country<br />  in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera Keralan<br />  {A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule on accepting the<br />  Chola suzerainty.</p>
<p>  Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and his<br />  father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at <br />Jayamaliswarem<br />  in A.D.1023 and built a Salai for providing food named as Chola-<br />  Keralan Chalai and for revenue for its expenses gifted a village<br />  named Chola-Kerala Nallur.</p>
<p>  Rajendra Chola ? 1 in memory of his mother after her death made a<br />  statue of herself and installed at the temple known as <br />Sembianmathevi<br />  at Nagapattinam and made arrangements for its worship. In Sri Lanka<br />  too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a temple by the name<br />  Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory.</p>
<p>  Rajendra Chila ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi daughter of<br />  the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name <br />Vananvanmadevi<br />  daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur.</p>
<p>  Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as<br />  Gangaikondasolapuram west of present Chidambaram and there he built<br />  his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" <br />commemorating<br />  his victory over Kerala kings.</p>
<p>  Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054}</p>
<p>  With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest son the<br />  Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-regent of<br />  Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. When <br />he<br />  ascended the throne among the countries that were still under the<br />  Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country.</p>
<p>  During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty at<br />  Mahodai and of Venadu were agitating to get their freedom.<br />  Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which first<br />  proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera <br />Keralan<br />  in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant Atthivaranam.</p>
<p>  He appointed Rajasimhan{1028-1043} the son of Vira Kerala as the<br />  Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who <br />continued<br />  to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had friendly<br />  relations with them for some time.</p>
<p>  This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami Temple at<br />  Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli pandiya was built by the Chera king<br />  Rajasimha, but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. <br />Rajendra<br />  Chola too has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042</p>
<p>  Further in the 14th year of the Sunder Chola Pandiya devar at <br />Mannar<br />  Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of the <br />Chera<br />  king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra Chola<br />  Vinnagar Alvar.</p>
<p>  Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started <br />agitating<br />  for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda Muvar of <br />the<br />  region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an expedition to<br />  Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from his kingdom to<br />  the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and Rajadhiraja's <br />forces<br />  further destroyed the military acadamy and arms centre that became<br />  active again at Kanthalur Sala,i and attacked and defeated Vilignam<br />  which revived its efforts under Aye kings to become independent, <br />and<br />  was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam.</p>
<p>  However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule accepting <br />the<br />  suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. Rajasimha <br />was<br />  followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082} on the Chera throne.</p>
<p>  Period of Rajendra Chola ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063}</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle field <br />at<br />  Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2<br />{A.D.1051-<br />  1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from <br />A.D.1051,<br />  crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and continued<br />  with the war with success to Cholas.</p>
<p>  During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola <br />Keralan<br />  in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the same <br />title<br />  as Chola Keralan.</p>
<p>  Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1063-1070}</p>
<p>  With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063-1070} <br />was<br />  crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending the<br />  Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram started<br />  agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. Virarajendra <br />first<br />  sent an expedition to Venad and killed the younger brother of the<br />  Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king himself escaped from <br />his<br />  country.</p>
<p>  Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara Ravi ? <br />2,<br />  it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war expedition<br />  to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai and<br />  Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. The<br />  Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He defeating<br />  the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants and<br />  maids.</p>
<p>  Period of Adhirajendra Chola {A.D1070-1073}</p>
<p>  With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{A.D1070-1074}<br />  succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-<br />regent<br />  from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period of few<br />  months due to illness.</p>
<p>  During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari<br />  Athirajathirajadever who also bore the title "Virakeralan" ruling<br />  from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at<br />  Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps.</p>
<p>  Period of Kulothtunga Chola {A.D1070-1120}</p>
<p>  After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in the <br />Chola<br />  country with no direct male decendents in the line of the Rajaraja<br />  Chola ? 1 to succeed.</p>
<p>  Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely<br />  Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful heir to <br />the<br />  chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja in the<br />  year A.D.1074.</p>
<p>  Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the Chera<br />  kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain freedom <br />from<br />  from the Chola kings.</p>
<p>  Kulothtunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. He<br />  captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of Kumari<br />  all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a subordinate king<br />  and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he stationd a<br />  nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under the<br />  general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan.</p>
<p>  Kulothtunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in<br />  Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar forces<br />  (suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his death in<br />  this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma <br />{A.D.1082-<br />  1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to Cholas.</p>
<p>  He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at<br />  Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 Rama <br />Varma<br />  Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the Cholas and<br />  regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothtunga Chola ? <br />1<br />  didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost territories of <br />the<br />  Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 years <br />of<br />  intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras.</p>
<p>  The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more Chola-<br />Chera<br />  conflicts after Kulothtunga ? 1 during the period of the remaing<br />  Cholas upto A.D.1250</p>

<blockquote><p>  ================<br />  Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>  This is confirmed by the Copper Plates found in Esalam about 20 <br />  years back and published by Dr. Nadana Kasinathan.</p>
<p>  This CP of RjC is very important because this confirms ::</p>
<p>  1. Aditha Karikalan did put Veerapandiayan's HEAD on a pole outside <br />  Thanjai Fort;   <br />  2. This confirms that Krishnan's Raman's son - named after ARUMOZHI <br />  and close friend of RAJENDRA I - had another Brother ! (Recall <br />  Writer Balakumaran's Kadigai !)</p>
<p>  3. This also confirms that Rajendra constructed the Siva temple to <br />  honour HIS GURU SARVA SIVA PANDITHAR !</p>
<p>  Those persuing these leads also should bear in mind that </p>
<p>  PIRANTAKAN KUNDAVAI w/o Vandhiyathevan had constructed</p>
<p>  (1) Rajarajeswaram Siva Temple in Dadapuram,<br />  (2) (Jagannatha ) Vinnagaram in Dadapuram and<br />  (3) Kundavai JINALAYAM near Dadapuram.</p>
<p>  Dadapuram is hardly within 10 Km vicinity from Esalam.</p>
<p>  Ennayiram, which is also much discussed in our Group (Recall <br />  Ennayiram NARASIMHA PERUMAL was Kulothunga I's KULADEYVAM - during <br />  Dasavatharam movie discussions) and Kulothungas encouraged <br />  THIRUVOYMOZHI learning / preaching and gave huge grants for about <br />  250 Vaishnavites students &amp; their Revered Teachers ) is also nearby.</p>
<p>  Kundrathur (Chennai) born SEKKIZHAR met ANABAYAN in ENNAYIRAM and at <br />  his Orders reached Chidambaram and completed Periyapuranam !</p>
<p>  KAVI KALAMEGAM was born in Ennayiram. This is located about 10 Kms <br />  south of Tindivanam !</p>
<p>  Re your main query as to what made THE YOUNG TIGER ADITHA KARIKALAN <br />  TO PLAY WITH VEERAPANDIYA AND TAKE OFF HIS HEAD (as described in the <br />  Thiruvalangadu Copper Plates), it should be avenging an earlier <br />  beheading - as you rightly pointed out!</p>

<p>    hi venkatesh</p>
<p>    just a thought - what was the cause for aditya to take such a gory<br />    step of beheading veerapandiya and exhibit on a pole outside <br />  tanjore.<br />    its a very cruel act and some grave act of veerapandiya should have<br />    caused this. in this we should see that veerapandiya himself took <br />  the<br />    title chola thalai konda - however you look at it, where thalai <br />  konda<br />    means defeated or literally took the head, he did defeat a chola <br />  king.<br />    who was this king. in this context would a direct descendant ( ok -<br />    descendant) of such a person be dietified in so short a time. i <br />  doubt it</p>
<p>    Reposting an earlier interesting post on this subject, maybe we </p>
<p>    Dear All,</p>
<p>    Few Interesting topics for discussion</p>
<p>    Reg. Pandiyas</p>
<p>    Veerapandian s/o Rajasimha pandiyan (946-966AD)<br />    carried few titles " Cholan thalai konda ko veera pandiyan" ,<br />    "Chozhandagan".<br />    He created a village named chozhandaga chathurvedi mangalam (<br />    chozhavandhan)(6th Aatchiyaandu),<br />    but we dont have any clue to find which chola king is reffered<br />    here. Though<br />    Neelakanda shastri's<br />    interpretation is different for "THALAI KONDA" ,the defeat of a<br />    chola king<br />    by Veera Pandiya<br />    is confirmed. The possibe chola kings at that time could be :<br />    1. Rasaadhithyan 1- was killed by the arrow of Boodhugan2(Kanga<br />    king) &amp; he<br />    is known as "AANAI MEL<br />    THUNJIYA DEVAR"(949AD).<br />    2. Paranthagan1- Has died after his elder son, so could be<br />    inbetween 953-<br />    955AD.<br />    3. Kandaradhityan- Died in 957AD which also falls in the reign of<br />    VeeraPandiya, he is known<br />    as "MERKEZHUNDARULIYA DEVAR" we dont know the exact meaning of<br />    this title.<br />    4. Arinjayan- Ruled for 1yr ie 957-958AD and supposed to have died<br />    in a<br />    war.He is known<br />    as "ATRURTHUNJIYA DEVAR" also falls in the same period.<br />    I feel the possibility of the chola king defeated by VeeraPandiya<br />    could be<br />    Paranthagan 1<br />    since this happened in the sixth year of his reign.<br />    I presume Aadithya karikalan(Poodhivikramakesari, Parthivendra<br />    Varman also<br />    claims)<br />    should have severed Veera Pandiya's head in retaliation for the<br />    above act.<br />    Aadhitya karikalan<br />    has a title called 'VEERAPANDIYAN THALAI KONDA KO PARAKESARI<br />    VARMAN'.<br />    " Cholan thalai konda ko veera pandiyan" Was killed by<br />    'VEERAPANDIYAN THALAI KONDA KO PARAKESARI VARMAN'.<br />    Please post your comments.<br />    Reg. Vandhyathevan<br />    "A Part of the modern North Arcot district lying round about<br />    Brahmadesam was<br />    under the<br />    jurisdiction of Vallavarayar Vandhiyathever, the chief of the<br />    Samantas as he<br />    is called<br />    and husband of Rajaraja's elder sister Kundavai. Two other wives<br />    of this<br />    person are<br />    mentioned, Indaladevi and Mandaragauravanar Kundadeviyar who,<br />    despite the<br />    second part of<br />    her name appears to have been different from Paranthakan Kundavai<br />    Pirattiyar.The chola princess<br />    said to have been residing at the palace at Pazhayaru in the 4th &amp;     5th yrs<br />    of the reign. A<br />    Nadu came to be called 'Vallavaraiyar Nadu'after this chief of the<br />    samantas<br />    and part of it<br />    lay in the modern Salem district."<br />    Note- Page 226, THE COLAS by K.A.Neelakanta Shastri.</p>

        <p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>Really I have not into the Historical details of Veerapandya..</p>
<p>But I vaguely remember, Amarapujangar - was his Father's name also - <br />among others !</p>
<p>Kalki talks of Veerapandiayan's son - and rightly he would have <br />named him after Father's too ! We have to know whether any other <br />Amarapujangar King existed prior to that in their dynasty.</p>
<p>And this Amarapujangar was DEITY ! installed during Uthama's / <br />Sembianmadevi's period .. and RRC followed that grant...</p>
<p>It was JUST STIRRING .. which even Annual Report DID as early in <br />1926 - which I brought out to all your attention !</p>
<p>Re Bronzes of Nayanmars prior to RRC - I can check with others and <br />revert...</p>
<p>" Thirupathiyam " figures since Pandya (Nandhivarman) <br />inscriptions .. according to Dr. Kudavoil Balu Sir.</p>
<p>We can get more details on this.</p>
<p>anbudan / sps </p>
<blockquote><p>  3. another doubt - tirumurai kanda cholan - the legend is RRC made <br />the<br />  bronzes of the shivaite trio, held a festival in their honor and<br />  brought them infront of the closed secret room - so that the <br />thillai<br />  3000 had no choice but to open. If so, is he the first one to make<br />  bronzes of nayanars?, meaning did he start the worship of the <br />saints<br />  or alteast the practise of casting them in bronze</p>

<p>Dear sps sir, </p>
<p>ok some more questions:</p>
<p>1. If and a big if at that ,if this amarabujanga is the pandya - he<br />was very much alive when he was worshipped. am i right. since after<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  came, he is said to have vanquished him. </p>
<p>2. If so when did the practise of worshipping living people,let alone<br />kings start. Even though kings have claimed lineage from gods and god<br />king concept has been there, i think its the case of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  where we come<br />across the first time that a living person's image is consecrated and<br />worshipped in the big temple.</acronym></p>
<p>3. another doubt - tirumurai kanda cholan - the legend is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  made the<br />bronzes of the shivaite trio, held a festival in their honor and<br />brought them infront of the closed secret room - so that the thillai<br />3000 had no choice but to open. If so, is he the first one to make<br />bronzes of nayanars?, meaning did he start the worship of the saints<br />or alteast the practise of casting them in bronze</acronym></p>

<p>PANDYA QUEENS ::</p>
<p>Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>You are right..</p>
<p>Apart from Madurai being Capital, for the Pandya Kingdom, other <br />places like Nagerkoil (Suseendram - Moolabarudayar padai / army <br />famous inscriptions !) - was also having Palaces and the infight <br />among cousins caused lineage towards Cheras / Cholas depending on <br />situations...</p>
<p>That way it was NOT UNCOMMON for a Uthama / <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  to have Pandya <br />Queen .. who was always named as a MEENAVAN MADEVI or Chera Queen <br />named as VILLAVAN MADEVI...</acronym></p>
<p>In Cheras, at one point of time atleast there were 5 Big Groups <br />controlling - from Trivandrum to Malabar (Vanchi) and the infight <br />caused split among them - some leaned towards Cholas and some <br />towards Pandyas !</p>
<p>That happened even during MUTHARAYAS period as well .. those in <br />Narthamalai near Pudukottai were affliated towards Pandyas and those <br />near Senthalai / Memam (thirukandiyur) towards Cholas .. after <br />Vijayalaya conquered them ! Affliation more of geographical nature !</p>
<p>Gangaikondan in Tirunelveli District became important during <br />Rajendra days due to its Geographical prominence !</p>

        <p>Dear SPS, Vijay and Venkat,</p>
<p>Beautiful thread. Looks something like the History channel putting<br />forth all the possible postulates in their documentary :)</p>
<p>All your arguments are valid. Just thinking laterally, Venkat always<br />used to say that Kalki was influenced by Dumas and other authors.<br />Also, if we look at the mindset of people in the 50's, most of the<br />movies, atleast till the 70's have a lot of scenarios where the kids<br />get exchanged as soon as born. So is it something to do with the time<br />period when Kalki wrote the story? </p>
<p>Its always fascinating in those times to have the child grow in some<br />other family,later realize who the actual parents were and 'subam'.<br /><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , atleast SA is concerned, has a similar story line.</p>
<p>My two paise worth.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p></acronym></p>

<p>DEAR VENKAT,</p>
<p>NOT VERY UNLIKELY !</p>
<p>Like a Flash it occurs to me NOW !</p>
<p>In the Papanasam inscriptions - as quoted by me ealier in Kalvettu <br />series last week - IDHUVUM PAZHANKALLIL VETTINAPADI : Quote : " <br />Sembiyan Madevi Thiruvayirudhitha Uthama Chozhan " ... and proceeding <br />with confirmation of that grant by Uthama and a fresh grant by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  in <br />his 8th Regnal year !</acronym></p>
<p>In the same Papanasam only in another inscription " Sembian Madeviyar <br />vaitha amarabujanga devarkku .." figures.....</p>
<p>It is possible that KAKLI SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO IGNORE <br />SEMBIAYAN MADEVI THIRUVAYIRUDHITHA UTHAMA .... and characterised <br />SENDHAN AMUDHAN .. (Uthaman .. becoming Amudhan as you used to explain)</p>
<p>And if the ARE related to Papanasam mentioned of Amarabujangar also... <br />well .. this would have kindled a spark in him !</p>

<p>    Dear All,</p>
<p>    Few Interesting topics for discussion</p>
<p>    Reg. Pandiyas</p>
<p>    Veerapandian s/o Rajasimha pandiyan (946-966AD)<br />    carried few titles " Cholan thalai konda ko veera pandiyan" ,<br />    "Chozhandagan".<br />    He created a village named chozhandaga chathurvedi mangalam (<br />    chozhavandhan)(6th Aatchiyaandu),<br />    but we dont have any clue to find which chola king is reffered<br />    here. Though<br />    Neelakanda shastri's<br />    interpretation is different for "THALAI KONDA" ,the defeat of a<br />    chola king<br />    by Veera Pandiya<br />    is confirmed. The possibe chola kings at that time could be :<br />    1. Rasaadhithyan 1- was killed by the arrow of Boodhugan2(Kanga<br />    king) &amp; he<br />    is known as "AANAI MEL<br />    THUNJIYA DEVAR"(949AD).<br />    2. Paranthagan1- Has died after his elder son, so could be<br />    inbetween 953-<br />    955AD.<br />    3. Kandaradhityan- Died in 957AD which also falls in the reign of<br />    VeeraPandiya, he is known<br />    as "MERKEZHUNDARULIYA DEVAR" we dont know the exact meaning of<br />    this title.<br />    4. Arinjayan- Ruled for 1yr ie 957-958AD and supposed to have <br />died<br />    in a<br />    war.He is known<br />    as "ATRURTHUNJIYA DEVAR" also falls in the same period.<br />    I feel the possibility of the chola king defeated by VeeraPandiya<br />    could be<br />    Paranthagan 1<br />    since this happened in the sixth year of his reign.<br />    I presume Aadithya karikalan(Poodhivikramakesari, Parthivendra<br />    Varman also<br />    claims)<br />    should have severed Veera Pandiya's head in retaliation for the<br />    above act.<br />    Aadhitya karikalan<br />    has a title called 'VEERAPANDIYAN THALAI KONDA KO PARAKESARI<br />    VARMAN'.<br />    " Cholan thalai konda ko veera pandiyan" Was killed by<br />    'VEERAPANDIYAN THALAI KONDA KO PARAKESARI VARMAN'.<br />    Please post your comments.<br />    Reg. Vandhyathevan<br />    "A Part of the modern North Arcot district lying round about<br />    Brahmadesam was<br />    under the<br />    jurisdiction of Vallavarayar Vandhiyathever, the chief of the<br />    Samantas as he<br />    is called<br />    and husband of Rajaraja's elder sister Kundavai.

<p>================<br />Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>This is confirmed by the Copper Plates found in Esalam about 20 <br />years back and published by Dr. Nadana Kasinathan.</p>
<p>This CP of <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  is very important because this confirms ::</p>
<p>1. Aditha Karikalan did put Veerapandiayan's HEAD on a pole outside <br />Thanjai Fort;</p>
<p>2. This confirms that Krishnan's Raman's son - named after ARUMOZHI <br />and close friend of RAJENDRA I - had another Brother ! (Recall <br />Writer Balakumaran's Kadigai !)</p>
<p>3. This also confirms that Rajendra constructed the Siva temple to <br />honour HIS GURU SARVA SIVA PANDITHAR !</p>
<p>Those persuing these leads also should bear in mind that </p>
<p>PIRANTAKAN KUNDAVAI w/o Vandhiyathevan had constructed</p>
<p>(1) Rajarajeswaram Siva Temple in Dadapuram,<br />(2) (Jagannatha ) Vinnagaram in Dadapuram and<br />(3) Kundavai JINALAYAM near Dadapuram.</p>
<p>Dadapuram is hardly within 10 Km vicinity from Esalam.</p>
<p>Ennayiram, which is also much discussed in our Group (Recall <br />Ennayiram NARASIMHA PERUMAL was Kulothunga I's KULADEYVAM - during <br />Dasavatharam movie discussions) and Kulothungas encouraged <br />THIRUVOYMOZHI learning / preaching and gave huge grants for about <br />250 Vaishnavites students &amp; their Revered Teachers ) is also nearby.</p>
<p>Kundrathur (Chennai) born SEKKIZHAR met ANABAYAN in ENNAYIRAM and at <br />his Orders reached Chidambaram and completed Periyapuranam !</p>
<p>KAVI KALAMEGAM was born in Ennayiram. This is located about 10 Kms <br />south of Tindivanam !</p>
<p>Re your main query as to what made THE YOUNG TIGER ADITHA KARIKALAN <br />TO PLAY WITH VEERAPANDIYA AND TAKE OFF HIS HEAD (as described in the <br />Thiruvalangadu Copper Plates), it should be avenging an earlier <br />beheading - as you rightly pointed out!</p>

<p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  Few Interesting topics for discussion</p>

<p>  Veerapandian s/o Rajasimha pandiyan (946-966AD)<br />  carried few titles " Cholan thalai konda ko veera pandiyan" ,<br />  "Chozhandagan".<br />  He created a village named chozhandaga chathurvedi mangalam (<br />  chozhavandhan)(6th Aatchiyaandu),<br />  but we dont have any clue to find which chola king is reffered<br />  here. Though<br />  Neelakanda shastri's<br />  interpretation is different for "THALAI KONDA" ,the defeat of a<br />  chola king<br />  by Veera Pandiya<br />  is confirmed. The possibe chola kings at that time could be :<br />  1. Rasaadhithyan 1- was killed by the arrow of Boodhugan2(Kanga<br />  king) &amp; he<br />  is known as "AANAI MEL<br />  THUNJIYA DEVAR"(949AD).<br />  2. Paranthagan1- Has died after his elder son, so could be<br />  inbetween 953-<br />  955AD.<br />  3. Kandaradhityan- Died in 957AD which also falls in the reign of<br />  VeeraPandiya, he is known<br />  as "MERKEZHUNDARULIYA DEVAR" we dont know the exact meaning of<br />  this title.<br />  4. Arinjayan- Ruled for 1yr ie 957-958AD and supposed to have died<br />  in a<br />  war.He is known<br />  as "ATRURTHUNJIYA DEVAR" also falls in the same period.<br />  I feel the possibility of the chola king defeated by VeeraPandiya<br />  could be<br />  Paranthagan 1<br />  since this happened in the sixth year of his reign.<br />  I presume Aadithya karikalan(Poodhivikramakesari, Parthivendra<br />  Varman also<br />  claims)<br />  should have severed Veera Pandiya's head in retaliation for the<br />  above act.<br />  Aadhitya karikalan<br />  has a title called 'VEERAPANDIYAN THALAI KONDA KO PARAKESARI<br />  VARMAN'.<br />  " Cholan thalai konda ko veera pandiyan" Was killed by<br />  'VEERAPANDIYAN THALAI KONDA KO PARAKESARI VARMAN'.<br />  Please post your comments.<br />  Reg. Vandhyathevan<br />  "A Part of the modern North Arcot district lying round about<br />  Brahmadesam was<br />  under the<br />  jurisdiction of Vallavarayar Vandhiyathever, the chief of the<br />  Samantas as he<br />  is called<br />  and husband of Rajaraja's elder sister Kundavai. Two other wives<br />  of this<br />  person are<br />  mentioned, Indaladevi and Mandaragauravanar Kundadeviyar who,<br />  despite the<br />  second part of<br />  her name appears to have been different from Paranthakan Kundavai<br />  Pirattiyar.The chola princess<br />  said to have been residing at the palace at Pazhayaru in the 4th &amp;   5th yrs<br />  of the reign. A<br />  Nadu came to be called 'Vallavaraiyar Nadu'after this chief of the<br />  samantas<br />  and part of it<br />  lay in the modern Salem district."<br />  Note- Page 226, THE COLAS by K.A.Neelakanta Shastri.</p>

        <p>-Hi Vijay</p>
<p>i am not trying to find a missing link in history. just some clue to <br />why kalki made amarabhujanga( palaiya mathuranthaka thevar) grow as <br />the son of sembian madevi.</p>
<p>i also dont beleive the pandyas were deadly enemies of the cholas <br />during the period- atleast not to the level portrayed.that is after <br />veerapandyas death.</p>
<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had a pandya queen or atleast the name meenavan madevi suggests <br />so.<br />regards<br />venketesh</acronym></p>

<p>It can be easily seen that from Aditya I, Chozha connections with <br />Pandya got strained.</p>
<p>Parantaka I was became to be known as " MATHIRAIYUM EEZHAMUM KONDA <br />KOPPARAKESARI ... " ...</p>
<p>Like Aditya representing SURYA, Parantaka representing SIVA,  <br />Amarapujangan also represented the deity Vishnu ..</p>

<p>Re Amarapujangan getting the seat of worship ... under Uthama rule :</p>
<p>Therefore Papanasam inscription should be inferred as bronze of the <br />Deity (named as Amarapujanga ) and not the King !</p>

<p>    A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY ON MEDIEVAL CHOLAS<br />    AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE CHERAS {KERALAS} OF THE CONTEMPORARY<br />    PERIOD {A.D.801 - A.D 1120}</p>
<p>    Introduction</p>
<p>    During the periods of the nineth and the tenth centuries, the <br />Chera<br />    country was ruled by three principal royal dynasties known as the<br />    Ayes, Venads and Kulasekaras from three distinctive regions of <br />  Kerala<br />    (the Sanskritised version of Chera), and the kings of these three<br />    dynasties and the other Chieftains ruling small regions of rest <br />of<br />    the Kerala, all were generally referred to as the Cheras or <br />Keralas<br />    by the people of Chola &amp; Pandiya countries of this period.</p>
<p>    The Aye dynasty were ruling a region covering from the present<br />    Nagerkoil of Tamil Nadu the southern end of the Aye kingdom, <br />  upwards<br />    into Kerala to the present Anjuthengu in the north of the present<br />    Thiruvananthapuram, and was known as Aye Nadu. Their capital was <br />at<br />    Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye Nadu<br />    also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic studies<br />    acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was located <br />  deep<br />    south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to <br />Nagerkoil <br />  the<br />    southern end of the Aye kingdom.</p>
<p>    The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu <br />covering a<br />    region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as Kollam<br />    Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport city <br />on<br />    the west Kerala.</p>
<p>    The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond <br />  Kottayam<br />    further north upto and around the present region of Kolikkodu<br />    (Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital at<br />    Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as <br />Makothai, <br />  and<br />    a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu country <br />of<br />    that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil Nadu,<br />    bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under <br />their<br />    rule during this period.</p>
<p>    Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory ruled by<br />    Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" <br />under<br />    different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who <br />  accepted<br />    the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their <br />respective<br />    regions as subordinates to them.</p>
<p>    The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya Chola</p>
<p>    Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a <br />  powerful<br />    Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in<br />    Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country covering the length of the <br />    Kolli -<br />    Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his <br />capital<br />    at Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>    He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />    nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur (the<br />    Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the <br />  Pandiya<br />    country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably during<br />    this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the <br />Kulasekara<br />    dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to rule <br />  over<br />    this region.</p>
<p>    Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as an<br />    incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of this <br />  period<br />    referred to him as Kulasekara Perumal in reverence.</p>
<p>    He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in Cholanadu, <br />and<br />    Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, and <br />has<br />    composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu named<br />    as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda Mala". <br />He<br />    abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was venerated <br />as<br />    one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the<br />    Kulasekara Alvar.</p>
<p>    The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. <br />With<br />    the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son <br />Rajasekaran<br />    {A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was also <br />  known<br />    by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an ardent<br />    devotee of God Siva.</p>
<p>    Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram <br />spent<br />    most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at the<br />    Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) <br />in <br />  the<br />    Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great Tamil <br />  Saiva<br />    Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a <br />pilgrimage <br />  to<br />    the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera king<br />    Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva <br />  Saint,<br />    also went to Thiruvarur at this same time.</p>
<p>    Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera king<br />    composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as "Mummanikkovai". <br />From<br />    there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar to <br />  the<br />    Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other Siva<br />    Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further hyms in<br />    Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponnvanna Anthathi"<br />    and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and <br />venerated<br />    as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by him <br />  have<br />    been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a<br />    collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by <br />various<br />    Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala State).</p>
<p>    Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar the<br />    Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the <br />palace <br />  of<br />    this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the <br />Chera<br />    country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam<br />    (Udagai) region of TamilNadu.</p>
<p>    While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar died.<br />    Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the<br />    Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in the<br />    same year.</p>
<p>    It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and partly<br />    during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great Saiva<br />    Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who <br />  founded<br />    the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala.</p>
<p>    It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal <br />from<br />    Venad in the Chera country though not classified under the sixty-<br />    three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by him<br />    named `Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola <br />country,<br />    has been included in the nineth Thirumurai. It appears the <br />Venattu<br />    Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the<br />    Sundaramurthi Nayanar.</p>
<p>    The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was <br />  followed<br />    by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma Kulasekaran <br />(alias<br />    Ko-Kandan) (A.D.844 - 885) on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram.<br />    Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had a daughter <br />by<br />    the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva from another<br />    Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala.</p>
<p>    It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, the <br />  Chola<br />    dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in <br />partial <br />  or<br />    total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for nearly <br />six<br />    centuries.</p>
<p>    Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}</p>
<p>    The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into <br />  prominance<br />    was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}, who ruled the Chola<br />    country from Thanjavur.</p>
<p>    It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very friendly<br />    relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his <br />daughter<br />    both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good <br />relations<br />    that existed with the Chola country, had made their endowments <br />to <br />  the<br />    Siva temples in the Chola country</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu Ravi<br />    also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravarti Kulasekaradeva, the<br />    villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named <br />Satanur <br />  in<br />    the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as <br />Tiruayanisuramudaiya<br />    Nayanar.</p>
<p>    The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the <br />temple <br />  of<br />    Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) in <br />the<br />    year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu Ravi <br />  also<br />    gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in<br />    Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870.</p>
<p>    Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907}</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his son<br />    Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, who <br />  was<br />    a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of his <br />  rule<br />    the Athitha Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the Chera <br />king<br />    Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king.</p>
<p>    A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was <br />greatly<br />    instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was rewarded<br />    jointly by the Chola &amp; Chera kings with a crown, palace, <br />elephants,<br />    royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan Thamil <br />  Verl".</p>
<p>    Towards the middle of Athitha Chola's rule the Chera king Sthani <br />  Ravi<br />    died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara{A.D.885-917} on <br />the<br />    Chera throne.</p>
<p>    During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan <br />  (A.D.860-<br />    905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to them <br />was<br />    born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920).</p>
<p>    Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907-953}</p>
<p>    Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-<br />  953)<br />    on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan Adigal<br />    daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. He <br />  also<br />    married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />    Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the <br />  present<br />    Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a further<br />    queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of the <br />  Venad<br />    King of the Chera country, who refer themselves as "Villavar'.</p>
<p>    Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named<br />    Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a <br />younger <br />  son<br />    by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan.</p>
<p>    A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named <br />Velankumaran<br />    was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the <br />Prince<br />    Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu.</p>
<p>    Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the Pandiyanadu <br />  waged<br />    war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera king <br />Rama<br />    Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha.</p>
<p>    Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the<br />    assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with Paranthaha <br />and<br />    his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma at<br />    Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in Sri<br />    Lanka.</p>
<p>    As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri <br />Lankan<br />    king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, returned <br />to <br />  the<br />    Chera Country of his mother.</p>
<p>    The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the foremost <br />  among<br />    the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara <br />dynasty,<br />    paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween these <br />  two<br />    countries to increase many folds. During this period there seems <br />to<br />    have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola<br />    country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king.</p>
<p>    The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the queen of<br />    Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for lighting<br />    lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year A.D.923.</p>
<p>    In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-arisilar Kumaran a native of <br />the<br />    Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala country<br />    gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in<br />    Kudumiyam\nmalai in Cholanadu</p>
<p>    In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of <br />Malainadu<br />    gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in <br />  Cholanadu.</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold for<br />    lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in Thanjavur.</p>
<p>    She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named<br />    Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During her <br />  time<br />    a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present <br />  Pondicherry)<br />    and named after her as Kokkilanadi-pereri in Chola country.</p>
<p>    There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala <br />  Kurumban<br />    given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha Chola <br />with <br />  the<br />    title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts to the the<br />    temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927.</p>
<p>    In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king<br />    Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier Chera <br />  king<br />    Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for <br />  lighting<br />    lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in <br />Thondainadu<br />    which was under Chola rule.</p>
<p>    Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu<br />    (Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated a <br />  lamp<br />    to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince<br />    Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone <br />temple <br />  to<br />    Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in <br />  Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>    Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at <br />Thirumalpuram <br />  in<br />    Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of Kodungolur<br />    (Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948.</p>
<p>    Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the<br />    presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur <br />  A.D.952</p>
<p>    Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama Varma, <br />the<br />    king Kothai Ravi Varma{A.D.917-947} succeeded on the Chera <br />throne <br />  at<br />    Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country.</p>
<p>    After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by<br />    Indukotha Varma{A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at <br />Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>    Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957}</p>
<p>    After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola <br />  (A.D..950-<br />    957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with<br />    Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king his<br />    thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious <br />life,<br />    and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil <br />known<br />    as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the nineth<br />    Thirumurai.)</p>
<p>    Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957}</p>
<p>    He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded to <br />  the<br />    Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king the<br />    Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar.</p>
<p>    Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970}</p>
<p>    With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the Sundera <br />  Chola<br />    ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the <br />  Malaiyaman<br />    king of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar<br />    Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias Thiribhuvanamatheviyar <br />and<br />    also Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and to <br />the<br />    former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1.</p>
<p>    During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was succeeded <br />by<br />    Bhaskara Ravi Varma -1{A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. Baskara <br />Ravi<br />    Varma - 2{A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted Bhakara Ravi <br />  Varma ?<br />    1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which stretched from the <br />present<br />    Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region encompassing the <br />Kudamalainadu,<br />    Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-regent probably from Uthahai in <br />the<br />    Kongu region which was under the Chera rule during this period.</p>
<p>    Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985}</p>
<p>    After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 was the<br />    legitimate heir to the Chola throne, but he whole heartedly gave <br />  way<br />    to Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola <br />being<br />    his paternal uncle to rule for some period.</p>
<p>    Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named Panchavanmatheviyar <br />  who<br />    was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar known as <br />Kandan<br />    Sundera Cholan.</p>
<p>    Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014}</p>
<p>    Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by the <br />  heir<br />    apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D.985-1014} on the Chola throne.</p>
<p>    Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman king <br />of<br />    Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was also as<br />    Thiribhuvanamadevi.</p>
<p>    One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi the daughter of the <br />  king<br />    of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a queen known as<br />    Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />    Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west of <br />Thirutchirappalli<br />    bordering Kerala state. It was to this Vanavanmadevi the greatest<br />    emperor in the Chola history namely the Rajendra Chola ? 1 was <br />  born.</p>
<p>    With the accession of Rajaraja Chola-1 on the Chola throne and <br />with<br />    his imperialistic ambitions over South India, found that it was<br />    necessary initially to overcome the powerfull Cheras.</p>
<p>    During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the Aye<br />    dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a<br />    military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur <br />Salai<br />    which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced great<br />    trained warriors.</p>
<p>    Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines of<br />    these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera<br />  (Kerala)<br />    country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an<br />    absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern region <br />of<br />    the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull <br />kings.</p>
<p>    Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />    A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />    acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions <br />again<br />    in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their <br />military<br />    acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>    This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in <br />the<br />    year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai <br />military<br />    acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of<br />    Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />  Vilignam.</p>
<p>    The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The <br />  Rajaraja<br />    Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village called<br />    Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />    Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>    Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants in <br />  the<br />    year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi <br />  (October/November)<br />    a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />    nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the <br />God <br />  at<br />    the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river and <br />a<br />    perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p>
<p>    He now turned his attention on his conquest of the territories <br />in <br />  the<br />    Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the <br />  present<br />    Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja-1 thereafter sent an ambassador <br />to <br />  the<br />    co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of Mahodai ruling from<br />    Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as Udagai), namely <br />  Baskara<br />    Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the family of Kulasekaras,<br />    requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty and to pay tributes.</p>
<p>    The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of <br />  Uthahai<br />    and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja Chola-1 <br />  who<br />    sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year A.D.1014<br />    which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears <br />  Baskara<br />    Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu was controlled by <br />  Cholas.</p>
<p>    The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the north <br />and<br />    central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara Ravivarman<br />    Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the<br />    Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram<br />    (Kodungolur). It appears Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 too accepted the<br />    Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in the<br />    Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the territories <br />of<br />    Chera country ruled by the other chieftans which were under <br />Baskara<br />    Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy.</p>
<p>    The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory <br />  (Kolladesam)<br />    and captured the the region along with its seaport capital the <br />  Kollam<br />    (proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain <br />Govardhana<br />    Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the<br />    Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu.</p>
<p>    Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044}</p>
<p>    Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was succeeeded <br />by<br />    his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a co-<br />    regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012.</p>
<p>    During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year A.D.1019, <br />with<br />    the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 of<br />    Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his <br />second<br />    son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who <br />  defeated<br />    the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital <br />Mahothai<br />    and secured his crown, diadem and an island called Santhimathivu<br />    belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic sea. In <br />this <br />  war<br />    Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death.</p>
<p>    With the his securing of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? 1<br />    assumed the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 <br />gave <br />  the<br />    title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and <br />  appointed<br />    him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu of <br />the<br />    Kerala country.</p>
<p>    However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war expedition<br />    with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera <br />  country<br />    in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera <br />Keralan<br />    {A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule on accepting <br />the<br />    Chola suzerainty.</p>
<p>    Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and his<br />    father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at <br />  Jayamaliswarem<br />    in A.D.1023 and built a Salai for providing food named as Chola-<br />    Keralan Chalai and for revenue for its expenses gifted a village<br />    named Chola-Kerala Nallur.</p>
<p>    Rajendra Chola ? 1 in memory of his mother after her death made a<br />    statue of herself and installed at the temple known as <br />  Sembianmathevi<br />    at Nagapattinam and made arrangements for its worship. In Sri <br />Lanka<br />    too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a temple by the name<br />    Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory.</p>
<p>    Rajendra Chila ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi daughter <br />of<br />    the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name <br />  Vananvanmadevi<br />    daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur.</p>
<p>    Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as<br />    Gangaikondasolapuram west of present Chidambaram and there he <br />built<br />    his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" <br />  commemorating<br />    his victory over Kerala kings.</p>
<p>    Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054}</p>
<p>    With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest son <br />the<br />    Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-regent of<br />    Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. <br />When <br />  he<br />    ascended the throne among the countries that were still under the<br />    Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country.</p>
<p>    During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty at<br />    Mahodai and of Venadu were agitating to get their freedom.<br />    Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which <br />first<br />    proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera <br />  Keralan<br />    in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant Atthivaranam.</p>
<p>    He appointed Rajasimhan{1028-1043} the son of Vira Kerala as the<br />    Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who <br />  continued<br />    to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had friendly<br />    relations with them for some time.</p>
<p>    This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami Temple <br />at<br />    Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli pandiya was built by the Chera king<br />    Rajasimha, but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. <br />  Rajendra<br />    Chola too has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042</p>
<p>    Further in the 14th year of the Sunder Chola Pandiya devar at <br />  Mannar<br />    Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of the <br />  Chera<br />    king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra Chola<br />    Vinnagar Alvar.</p>
<p>    Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started <br />  agitating<br />    for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda Muvar of <br />  the<br />    region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an expedition to<br />    Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from his kingdom <br />to<br />    the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and Rajadhiraja's <br />  forces<br />    further destroyed the military acadamy and arms centre that <br />became<br />    active again at Kanthalur Sala,i and attacked and defeated <br />Vilignam<br />    which revived its efforts under Aye kings to become independent, <br />  and<br />    was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam.</p>
<p>    However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule accepting <br />  the<br />    suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. <br />Rajasimha <br />  was<br />    followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082} on the Chera <br />throne.</p>
<p>    Period of Rajendra Chola ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063}</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle <br />field <br />  at<br />    Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2<br />  {A.D.1051-<br />    1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from <br />  A.D.1051,<br />    crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and <br />continued<br />    with the war with success to Cholas.</p>
<p>    During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola <br />  Keralan<br />    in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the same <br />  title<br />    as Chola Keralan.</p>
<p>    Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1063-1070}</p>
<p>    With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063-<br />1070} <br />  was<br />    crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending the<br />    Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram started<br />    agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. Virarajendra <br />  first<br />    sent an expedition to Venad and killed the younger brother of the<br />    Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king himself escaped <br />from <br />  his<br />    country.</p>
<p>    Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara <br />Ravi ? <br />  2,<br />    it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war <br />expedition<br />    to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai and<br />    Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. The<br />    Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He <br />defeating<br />    the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants and<br />    maids.</p>
<p>    Period of Adhirajendra Chola {A.D1070-1073}</p>
<p>    With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{A.D1070-1074}<br />    succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-<br />  regent<br />    from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period of <br />few<br />    months due to illness.</p>
<p>    During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari<br />    Athirajathirajadever who also bore the title "Virakeralan" ruling<br />    from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at<br />    Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps.</p>
<p>    Period of Kulothtunga Chola {A.D1070-1120}</p>
<p>    After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in the <br />  Chola<br />    country with no direct male decendents in the line of the <br />Rajaraja<br />    Chola ? 1 to succeed.</p>
<p>    Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely<br />    Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful heir <br />to <br />  the<br />    chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja in <br />the<br />    year A.D.1074.</p>
<p>    Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the Chera<br />    kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain freedom <br />  from<br />    from the Chola kings.</p>
<p>    Kulothtunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. He<br />    captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of <br />Kumari<br />    all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a subordinate <br />king<br />    and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he stationd <br />a<br />    nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under the<br />    general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan.</p>
<p>    Kulothtunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in<br />    Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar <br />forces<br />    (suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his death <br />in<br />    this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma <br />  {A.D.1082-<br />    1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to Cholas.</p>
<p>    He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at<br />    Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 Rama <br />  Varma<br />    Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the Cholas <br />and<br />    regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothtunga <br />Chola ? <br />  1<br />    didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost territories <br />of <br />  the<br />    Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 <br />years <br />  of<br />    intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras.</p>
<p>    The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more Chola-<br />  Chera<br />    conflicts after Kulothtunga ? 1 during the period of the remaing<br />    Cholas upto A.D.1250</p>

<p>        During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the <br />  Aye<br />        dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up <br />a<br />        military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur <br />  Salai<br />        which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced <br />  great<br />        trained warriors.</p>
<p>        Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines <br />  of<br />        these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera<br />      (Kerala)<br />        country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was <br />an<br />        absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern <br />  region of<br />        the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull <br />    kings.</p>
<p>        Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />        A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />        acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions <br />    again<br />        in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their <br />    military<br />        acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>        This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali <br />  in <br />    the<br />        year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai <br />  military<br />        acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king <br />of<br />        Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />      Vilignam.</p>
<p>        The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The <br />      Rajaraja<br />        Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village <br />  called<br />        Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />        Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>        Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants <br />  in <br />      the<br />        year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi <br />      (October/November)<br />        a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />        nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of <br />the <br />    God <br />      at<br />        the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river <br />  and a<br />        perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p>

<p>        A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY ON MEDIEVAL CHOLAS<br />        AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE CHERAS {KERALAS} OF THE <br />  CONTEMPORARY<br />        PERIOD {A.D.801 - A.D 1120}</p>
<p>        Introduction</p>
<p>        During the periods of the nineth and the tenth centuries, the <br />    Chera<br />        country was ruled by three principal royal dynasties known as <br />  the<br />        Ayes, Venads and Kulasekaras from three distinctive regions <br />of <br />      Kerala<br />        (the Sanskritised version of Chera), and the kings of these <br />  three<br />        dynasties and the other Chieftains ruling small regions of <br />  rest of<br />        the Kerala, all were generally referred to as the Cheras or <br />    Keralas<br />        by the people of Chola &amp; Pandiya countries of this period.</p>
<p>        The Aye dynasty were ruling a region covering from the present<br />        Nagerkoil of Tamil Nadu the southern end of the Aye kingdom, <br />      upwards<br />        into Kerala to the present Anjuthengu in the north of the <br />  present<br />        Thiruvananthapuram, and was known as Aye Nadu. Their capital <br />  was <br />    at<br />        Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye <br />  Nadu<br />        also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic <br />studies<br />        acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was <br />  located <br />      deep<br />        south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to <br />  Nagerkoil <br />      the<br />        southern end of the Aye kingdom.</p>
<p>        The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu <br />  covering <br />    a<br />        region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as <br />  Kollam<br />        Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport <br />  city <br />    on<br />        the west Kerala.</p>
<p>        The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond <br />      Kottayam<br />        further north upto and around the present region of Kolikkodu<br />        (Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital at<br />        Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as <br />  Makothai, <br />      and<br />        a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu <br />  country of<br />        that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil <br />  Nadu,<br />        bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under <br />  their<br />        rule during this period.</p>
<p>        Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory <br />ruled <br />  by<br />        Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" <br />  under<br />        different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who <br />      accepted<br />        the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their <br />    respective<br />        regions as subordinates to them.</p>
<p>        The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya <br />  Chola</p>
<p>        Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a <br />      powerful<br />        Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in<br />        Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country covering the length of <br />the <br />        Kolli -<br />        Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his <br />    capital<br />        at Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>        He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />        nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur <br />  (the<br />        Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the <br />      Pandiya<br />        country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably <br />  during<br />        this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the <br />    Kulasekara<br />        dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to <br />  rule <br />      over<br />        this region.</p>
<p>        Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as <br />an<br />        incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of <br />this <br />      period<br />        referred to him as Kulasekara Perumal in reverence.</p>
<p>        He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in <br />  Cholanadu, <br />    and<br />        Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, <br />and <br />  has<br />        composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu <br />named<br />        as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda <br />  Mala". <br />    He<br />        abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was <br />  venerated <br />    as<br />        one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the<br />        Kulasekara Alvar.</p>
<p>        The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. <br />  With<br />        the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son <br />    Rajasekaran<br />        {A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was <br />  also <br />      known<br />        by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an <br />  ardent<br />        devotee of God Siva.</p>
<p>        Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram <br />    spent<br />        most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at <br />  the<br />        Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur <br />(Mahodayapuram) <br />  in <br />      the<br />        Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great <br />Tamil <br />      Saiva<br />        Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a <br />  pilgrimage <br />      to<br />        the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera king<br />        Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva <br />      Saint,<br />        also went to Thiruvarur at this same time.</p>
<p>        Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera <br />  king<br />        composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as <br />"Mummanikkovai". <br />    From<br />        there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar <br />  to <br />      the<br />        Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other <br />Siva<br />        Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further <br />hyms <br />  in<br />        Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponnvanna Anthathi"<br />        and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and <br />    venerated<br />        as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by <br />  him <br />      have<br />        been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a<br />        collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by <br />    various<br />        Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala <br />State).</p>
<p>        Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar <br />  the<br />        Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the <br />  palace <br />      of<br />        this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the <br />  Chera<br />        country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam<br />        (Udagai) region of TamilNadu.</p>
<p>        While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar <br />  died.<br />        Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the<br />        Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in <br />  the<br />        same year.</p>
<p>        It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and <br />  partly<br />        during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great <br />  Saiva<br />        Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who <br />      founded<br />        the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala.</p>
<p>        It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal <br />  from<br />        Venad in the Chera country though not classified under the <br />  sixty-<br />        three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by <br />  him<br />        named `Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola <br />  country,<br />        has been included in the nineth Thirumurai. It appears the <br />  Venattu<br />        Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the<br />        Sundaramurthi Nayanar.</p>
<p>        The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was <br />      followed<br />        by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma Kulasekaran <br />    (alias<br />        Ko-Kandan) (A.D.844 - 885) on the Chera throne at <br />  Mahodayapuram.<br />        Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had a <br />  daughter <br />    by<br />        the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva from <br />  another<br />        Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala.</p>
<p>        It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, <br />  the <br />      Chola<br />        dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in <br />    partial <br />      or<br />        total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for <br />  nearly <br />    six<br />        centuries.</p>
<p>        Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}</p>
<p>        The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into <br />      prominance<br />        was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}, who ruled the <br />  Chola<br />        country from Thanjavur.</p>
<p>        It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very <br />  friendly<br />        relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his <br />  daughter<br />        both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good <br />    relations<br />        that existed with the Chola country, had made their <br />endowments <br />  to <br />      the<br />        Siva temples in the Chola country</p>
<p>        In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu <br />  Ravi<br />        also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravarti Kulasekaradeva, <br />  the<br />        villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named <br />  Satanur <br />      in<br />        the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as <br />    Tiruayanisuramudaiya<br />        Nayanar.</p>
<p>        The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the <br />    temple <br />      of<br />        Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) <br />  in <br />    the<br />        year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu <br />  Ravi <br />      also<br />        gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in<br />        Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870.</p>
<p>        Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907}</p>
<p>        In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his <br />son<br />        Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, <br />  who <br />      was<br />        a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of <br />  his <br />      rule<br />        the Athitha Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the <br />Chera <br />    king<br />        Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king.</p>
<p>        A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was <br />  greatly<br />        instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was <br />  rewarded<br />        jointly by the Chola &amp; Chera kings with a crown, palace, <br />    elephants,<br />        royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan <br />Thamil <br />      Verl".</p>
<p>        Towards the middle of Athitha Chola's rule the Chera king <br />  Sthani <br />      Ravi<br />        died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara{A.D.885-917} <br />on <br />  the<br />        Chera throne.</p>
<p>        During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan <br />      (A.D.860-<br />        905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to <br />  them <br />    was<br />        born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920).</p>
<p>        Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907-953}</p>
<p>        Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola <br />  (A.D.907-<br />      953)<br />        on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan <br />  Adigal<br />        daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. <br />  He <br />      also<br />        married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar <br />  Kandan<br />        Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the <br />      present<br />        Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a <br />  further<br />        queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of <br />  the <br />      Venad<br />        King of the Chera country, who refer themselves as "Villavar'.</p>
<p>        Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named<br />        Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a <br />  younger <br />      son<br />        by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan.</p>
<p>        A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named <br />  Velankumaran<br />        was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the <br />    Prince<br />        Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu.</p>
<p>        Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the <br />  Pandiyanadu <br />      waged<br />        war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera <br />king <br />    Rama<br />        Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha.</p>
<p>        Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the<br />        assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with <br />  Paranthaha <br />    and<br />        his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma <br />  at<br />        Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in <br />  Sri<br />        Lanka.</p>
<p>        As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri <br />    Lankan<br />        king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, <br />returned <br />  to <br />      the<br />        Chera Country of his mother.</p>
<p>        The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the <br />foremost <br />      among<br />        the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara <br />    dynasty,<br />        paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween <br />  these <br />      two<br />        countries to increase many folds. During this period there <br />  seems <br />    to<br />        have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola<br />        country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king.</p>
<p>        The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the <br />queen <br />  of<br />        Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for <br />  lighting<br />        lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year <br />  A.D.923.</p>
<p>        In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-arisilar Kumaran a native <br />  of <br />    the<br />        Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala <br />country<br />        gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in<br />        Kudumiyam\nmalai in Cholanadu</p>
<p>        In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of <br />  Malainadu<br />        gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in <br />      Cholanadu.</p>
<p>        In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold <br />for<br />        lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in <br />  Thanjavur.</p>
<p>        She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named<br />        Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During <br />  her <br />      time<br />        a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present <br />      Pondicherry)<br />        and named after her as Kokkilanadi-pereri in Chola country.</p>
<p>        There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala <br />      Kurumban<br />        given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha Chola <br />  with <br />      the<br />        title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts to the <br />the<br />        temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927.</p>
<p>        In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king<br />        Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier <br />  Chera <br />      king<br />        Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for <br />      lighting<br />        lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in <br />    Thondainadu<br />        which was under Chola rule.</p>
<p>        Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu<br />        (Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated <br />  a <br />      lamp<br />        to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>        In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince<br />        Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone <br />  temple <br />      to<br />        Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in <br />      Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>        Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at <br />  Thirumalpuram <br />      in<br />        Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of <br />Kodungolur<br />        (Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948.</p>
<p>        Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the<br />        presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur <br />      A.D.952</p>
<p>        Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama <br />  Varma, <br />    the<br />        king Kothai Ravi Varma{A.D.917-947} succeeded on the Chera <br />  throne <br />      at<br />        Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country.</p>
<p>        After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by<br />        Indukotha Varma{A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at <br />    Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>        Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957}</p>
<p>        After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola <br />      (A.D..950-<br />        957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with<br />        Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king <br />his<br />        thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious <br />    life,<br />        and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil <br />  known<br />        as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the nineth<br />        Thirumurai.)</p>
<p>        Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957}</p>
<p>        He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded <br />  to <br />      the<br />        Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king <br />the<br />        Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar.</p>
<p>        Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970}</p>
<p>        With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the <br />Sundera <br />      Chola<br />        ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the <br />      Malaiyaman<br />        king of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar<br />        Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias <br />Thiribhuvanamatheviyar <br />  and<br />        also Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and <br />  to <br />    the<br />        former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1.</p>
<p>        During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was <br />  succeeded by<br />        Bhaskara Ravi Varma -1{A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. <br />Baskara <br />    Ravi<br />        Varma - 2{A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted Bhakara Ravi <br />      Varma ?<br />        1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which stretched from the <br />  present<br />        Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region encompassing the <br />  Kudamalainadu,<br />        Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-regent probably from Uthahai <br />in <br />  the<br />        Kongu region which was under the Chera rule during this <br />period.</p>
<p>        Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985}</p>
<p>        After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 was the<br />        legitimate heir to the Chola throne, but he whole heartedly <br />  gave <br />      way<br />        to Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola <br />  being<br />        his paternal uncle to rule for some period.</p>
<p>        Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named <br />  Panchavanmatheviyar <br />      who<br />        was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar known as <br />  Kandan<br />        Sundera Cholan.</p>
<p>        Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014}</p>
<p>        Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by <br />  the <br />      heir<br />        apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D.985-1014} on the Chola throne.</p>
<p>        Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman <br />  king <br />    of<br />        Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was <br />also <br />  as<br />        Thiribhuvanamadevi.</p>
<p>        One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi the daughter of <br />  the <br />      king<br />        of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a queen known as<br />        Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of Paluvettaraiyar <br />Kandan<br />        Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west of <br />  Thirutchirappalli<br />        bordering Kerala state. It was to this Vanavanmadevi the <br />  greatest<br />        emperor in the Chola history namely the Rajendra Chola ? 1 <br />was <br />      born.</p>
<p>        With the accession of Rajaraja Chola-1 on the Chola throne <br />and <br />    with<br />        his imperialistic ambitions over South India, found that it <br />was<br />        necessary initially to overcome the powerfull Cheras.</p>
<p>        During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the <br />  Aye<br />        dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up <br />a<br />        military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur <br />  Salai<br />        which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced <br />  great<br />        trained warriors.</p>
<p>        Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines <br />  of<br />        these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera<br />      (Kerala)<br />        country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was <br />an<br />        absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern <br />  region of<br />        the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull <br />    kings.</p>
<p>        Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />        A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />        acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions <br />    again<br />        in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their <br />    military<br />        acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>        This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali <br />  in <br />    the<br />        year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai <br />  military<br />        acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king <br />of<br />        Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />      Vilignam.</p>
<p>        The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The <br />      Rajaraja<br />        Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village <br />  called<br />        Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />        Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>        Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants <br />  in <br />      the<br />        year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi <br />      (October/November)<br />        a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />        nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of <br />the <br />    God <br />      at<br />        the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river <br />  and a<br />        perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p>
<p>        He now turned his attention on his conquest of the <br />territories <br />  in <br />      the<br />        Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the <br />      present<br />        Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja-1 thereafter sent an <br />ambassador <br />  to <br />      the<br />        co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of Mahodai ruling <br />  from<br />        Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as Udagai), namely <br />      Baskara<br />        Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the family of <br />Kulasekaras,<br />        requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty and to pay <br />  tributes.</p>
<p>        The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of <br />      Uthahai<br />        and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja <br />Chola-<br />  1 <br />      who<br />        sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year <br />  A.D.1014<br />        which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears <br />      Baskara<br />        Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu was controlled by <br />      Cholas.</p>
<p>        The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the <br />  north <br />    and<br />        central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara <br />Ravivarman<br />        Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the<br />        Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram<br />        (Kodungolur). It appears Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 too accepted <br />  the<br />        Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in <br />  the<br />        Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the <br />  territories <br />    of<br />        Chera country ruled by the other chieftans which were under <br />    Baskara<br />        Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy.</p>
<p>        The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory <br />      (Kolladesam)<br />        and captured the the region along with its seaport capital <br />the <br />      Kollam<br />        (proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain <br />    Govardhana<br />        Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the<br />        Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu.</p>
<p>        Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044}</p>
<p>        Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was <br />  succeeeded by<br />        his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a <br />  co-<br />        regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012.</p>
<p>        During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year <br />A.D.1019, <br />    with<br />        the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 <br />  of<br />        Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his <br />    second<br />        son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who <br />      defeated<br />        the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital <br />    Mahothai<br />        and secured his crown, diadem and an island called <br />  Santhimathivu<br />        belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic sea. In <br />  this <br />      war<br />        Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death.</p>
<p>        With the his securing of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? <br />1<br />        assumed the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 <br />  gave <br />      the<br />        title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and <br />      appointed<br />        him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu <br />  of <br />    the<br />        Kerala country.</p>
<p>        However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war <br />  expedition<br />        with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera <br />      country<br />        in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera <br />    Keralan<br />        {A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule on <br />accepting <br />  the<br />        Chola suzerainty.</p>
<p>        Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and <br />his<br />        father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at <br />      Jayamaliswarem<br />        in A.D.1023 and built a Salai for providing food named as <br />  Chola-<br />        Keralan Chalai and for revenue for its expenses gifted a <br />  village<br />        named Chola-Kerala Nallur.</p>
<p>        Rajendra Chola ? 1 in memory of his mother after her death <br />  made a<br />        statue of herself and installed at the temple known as <br />      Sembianmathevi<br />        at Nagapattinam and made arrangements for its worship. In Sri <br />    Lanka<br />        too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a temple by the name<br />        Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory.</p>
<p>        Rajendra Chila ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi <br />  daughter <br />    of<br />        the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name <br />      Vananvanmadevi<br />        daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur.</p>
<p>        Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as<br />        Gangaikondasolapuram west of present Chidambaram and there he <br />    built<br />        his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" <br />      commemorating<br />        his victory over Kerala kings.</p>
<p>        Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054}</p>
<p>        With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest <br />  son <br />    the<br />        Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-<br />regent <br />  of<br />        Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. <br />  When <br />      he<br />        ascended the throne among the countries that were still under <br />  the<br />        Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country.</p>
<p>        During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty <br />at<br />        Mahodai and of Venadu were agitating to get their freedom.<br />        Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which <br />    first<br />        proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera <br />      Keralan<br />        in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant <br />Atthivaranam.</p>
<p>        He appointed Rajasimhan{1028-1043} the son of Vira Kerala as <br />  the<br />        Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who <br />      continued<br />        to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had <br />  friendly<br />        relations with them for some time.</p>
<p>        This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami <br />  Temple at<br />        Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli pandiya was built by the Chera <br />king<br />        Rajasimha, but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. <br />      Rajendra<br />        Chola too has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042</p>
<p>        Further in the 14th year of the Sunder Chola Pandiya devar at <br />      Mannar<br />        Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of <br />the <br />      Chera<br />        king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra Chola<br />        Vinnagar Alvar.</p>
<p>        Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started <br />      agitating<br />        for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda Muvar <br />  of <br />      the<br />        region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an expedition <br />  to<br />       ; Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from his <br />  kingdom <br />    to<br />        the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and <br />Rajadhiraja's <br />      forces<br />        further destroyed the military acadamy and arms centre that <br />  became<br />        active again at Kanthalur Sala,i and attacked and defeated <br />    Vilignam<br />        which revived its efforts under Aye kings to become <br />  independent, <br />      and<br />        was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam.</p>
<p>        However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule <br />  accepting <br />      the<br />        suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. <br />  Rajasimha <br />      was<br />        followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082} on the Chera <br />  throne.</p>
<p>        Period of Rajendra Chola ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063}</p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle <br />  field <br />      at<br />        Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2<br />      {A.D.1051-<br />        1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from <br />      A.D.1051,<br />        crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and <br />  continued<br />        with the war with success to Cholas.</p>
<p>        During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola <br />      Keralan<br />        in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the <br />  same <br />      title<br />        as Chola Keralan.</p>
<p>        Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1063-1070}</p>
<p>        With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063-<br />  1070} <br />      was<br />        crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending <br />  the<br />        Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram <br />  started<br />        agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. <br />  Virarajendra <br />      first<br />        sent an expedition to Venad and killed the younger brother of <br />  the<br />        Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king himself escaped <br />  from <br />      his<br />        country.</p>
<p>        Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara <br />  Ravi ? <br />      2,<br />        it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war <br />    expedition<br />        to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai <br />and<br />        Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. <br />  The<br />        Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He <br />  defeating<br />        the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants <br />  and<br />        maids.</p>
<p>        Period of Adhirajendra Chola {A.D1070-1073}</p>
<p>        With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{A.D1070-<br />  1074}<br />        succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-<br />      regent<br />        from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period <br />  of <br />    few<br />        months due to illness.</p>
<p>        During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari<br />        Athirajathirajadever who also bore the title "Virakeralan" <br />  ruling<br />        from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at<br />        Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps.</p>
<p>        Period of Kulothtunga Chola {A.D1070-1120}</p>
<p>        After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in <br />the <br />      Chola<br />        country with no direct male decendents in the line of the <br />  Rajaraja<br />        Chola ? 1 to succeed.</p>
<p>        Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely<br />        Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful <br />heir <br />  to <br />      the<br />        chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja <br />in <br />  the<br />        year A.D.1074.</p>
<p>        Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the <br />  Chera<br />        kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain <br />  freedom <br />      from<br />        from the Chola kings.</p>
<p>        Kulothtunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. <br />He<br />        captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of <br />    Kumari<br />        all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a <br />subordinate <br />    king<br />        and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he <br />  stationd a<br />        nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under <br />the<br />        general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan.</p>
<p>        Kulothtunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in<br />        Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar <br />  forces<br />        (suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his <br />  death in<br />        this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma <br />      {A.D.1082-<br />        1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to <br />  Cholas.</p>
<p>        He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at<br />        Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 <br />Rama <br />      Varma<br />        Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the <br />Cholas <br />  and<br />        regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothtunga <br />  Chola<br />    ? <br />      1<br />        didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost <br />territories <br />  of <br />      the<br />        Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 <br />  years <br />      of<br />        intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras.</p>
<p>        The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more <br />  Chola-<br />      Chera<br />        conflicts after Kulothtunga ? 1 during the period of the <br />  remaing<br />        Cholas upto A.D.1250</p>

        <p>Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>Kalki would have consulted <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastri &amp; Pandarathar atleast on <br />chozha History ..</acronym></p>
<p>But such finer details as Papanasam inscriptions etc., I doubt <br />whether he was aware..</p>
<p>In post independence era, Hindu temples, which were in ruins were <br />renovated much by the Nagarathar community.. some such role-model <br />should have backdrop while he characterised Sembian madevi..</p>
<p>This also should have motivated him narrate the details on <br />Sambandar, Sundarar, Appar and Azhwars !</p>
<p>While Parthiban Kanavu was told when India was struggling for its <br />Freedom, <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  might have been set to retain the rich culture we got <br />back from our Glorious past !</acronym></p>

<p>      During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the <br />Aye<br />      dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a<br />      military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur <br />Salai<br />      which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced <br />great<br />      trained warriors.</p>
<p>      Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines <br />of<br />      these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera<br />    (Kerala)<br />      country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an<br />      absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern <br />region of<br />      the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull <br />  kings.</p>
<p>      Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />      A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />      acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions <br />  again<br />      in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their <br />  military<br />      acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>      This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali <br />in <br />  the<br />      year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai <br />military<br />      acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of<br />      Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />    Vilignam.</p>
<p>      The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The <br />    Rajaraja<br />      Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village <br />called<br />      Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />      Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>      Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants <br />in <br />    the<br />      year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi <br />    (October/November)<br />      a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />      nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the <br />  God <br />    at<br />      the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river <br />and a<br />      perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p>

<p>      A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY ON MEDIEVAL CHOLAS<br />      AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE CHERAS {KERALAS} OF THE <br />CONTEMPORARY<br />      PERIOD {A.D.801 - A.D 1120}</p>
<p>      Introduction</p>
<p>      During the periods of the nineth and the tenth centuries, the <br />  Chera<br />      country was ruled by three principal royal dynasties known as <br />the<br />      Ayes, Venads and Kulasekaras from three distinctive regions of <br />    Kerala<br />      (the Sanskritised version of Chera), and the kings of these <br />three<br />      dynasties and the other Chieftains ruling small regions of <br />rest of<br />      the Kerala, all were generally referred to as the Cheras or <br />  Keralas<br />      by the people of Chola &amp; Pandiya countries of this period.</p>
<p>      The Aye dynasty were ruling a region covering from the present<br />      Nagerkoil of Tamil Nadu the southern end of the Aye kingdom, <br />    upwards<br />      into Kerala to the present Anjuthengu in the north of the <br />present<br />      Thiruvananthapuram, and was known as Aye Nadu. Their capital <br />was <br />  at<br />      Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye <br />Nadu<br />      also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic studies<br />      acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was <br />located <br />    deep<br />      south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to <br />Nagerkoil <br />    the<br />      southern end of the Aye kingdom.</p>
<p>      The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu <br />covering <br />  a<br />      region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as <br />Kollam<br />      Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport <br />city <br />  on<br />      the west Kerala.</p>
<p>      The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond <br />    Kottayam<br />      further north upto and around the present region of Kolikkodu<br />      (Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital at<br />      Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as <br />Makothai, <br />    and<br />      a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu <br />country of<br />      that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil <br />Nadu,<br />      bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under <br />their<br />      rule during this period.</p>
<p>      Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory ruled <br />by<br />      Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" <br />under<br />      different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who <br />    accepted<br />      the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their <br />  respective<br />      regions as subordinates to them.</p>
<p>      The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya <br />Chola</p>
<p>      Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a <br />    powerful<br />      Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in<br />      Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country covering the length of the <br />      Kolli -<br />      Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his <br />  capital<br />      at Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>      He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />      nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur <br />(the<br />      Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the <br />    Pandiya<br />      country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably <br />during<br />      this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the <br />  Kulasekara<br />      dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to <br />rule <br />    over<br />      this region.</p>
<p>      Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as an<br />      incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of this <br />    period<br />      referred to him as Kulasekara Perumal in reverence.</p>
<p>      He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in <br />Cholanadu, <br />  and<br />      Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, and <br />has<br />      composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu named<br />      as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda <br />Mala". <br />  He<br />      abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was <br />venerated <br />  as<br />      one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the<br />      Kulasekara Alvar.</p>
<p>      The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. <br />With<br />      the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son <br />  Rajasekaran<br />      {A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was <br />also <br />    known<br />      by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an <br />ardent<br />      devotee of God Siva.</p>
<p>      Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram <br />  spent<br />      most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at <br />the<br />      Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) <br />in <br />    the<br />      Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great Tamil <br />    Saiva<br />      Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a <br />pilgrimage <br />    to<br />      the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera king<br />      Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva <br />    Saint,<br />      also went to Thiruvarur at this same time.</p>
<p>      Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera <br />king<br />      composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as "Mummanikkovai". <br />  From<br />      there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar <br />to <br />    the<br />      Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other Siva<br />      Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further hyms <br />in<br />      Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponnvanna Anthathi"<br />      and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and <br />  venerated<br />      as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by <br />him <br />    have<br />      been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a<br />      collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by <br />  various<br />      Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala State).</p>
<p>      Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar <br />the<br />      Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the <br />palace <br />    of<br />      this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the <br />Chera<br />      country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam<br />      (Udagai) region of TamilNadu.</p>
<p>      While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar <br />died.<br />      Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the<br />      Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in <br />the<br />      same year.</p>
<p>      It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and <br />partly<br />      during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great <br />Saiva<br />      Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who <br />    founded<br />      the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala.</p>
<p>      It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal <br />from<br />      Venad in the Chera country though not classified under the <br />sixty-<br />      three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by <br />him<br />      named `Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola <br />country,<br />      has been included in the nineth Thirumurai. It appears the <br />Venattu<br />      Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the<br />      Sundaramurthi Nayanar.</p>
<p>      The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was <br />    followed<br />      by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma Kulasekaran <br />  (alias<br />      Ko-Kandan) (A.D.844 - 885) on the Chera throne at <br />Mahodayapuram.<br />      Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had a <br />daughter <br />  by<br />      the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva from <br />another<br />      Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala.</p>
<p>      It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, <br />the <br />    Chola<br />      dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in <br />  partial <br />    or<br />      total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for <br />nearly <br />  six<br />      centuries.</p>
<p>      Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}</p>
<p>      The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into <br />    prominance<br />      was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}, who ruled the <br />Chola<br />      country from Thanjavur.</p>
<p>      It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very <br />friendly<br />      relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his <br />daughter<br />      both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good <br />  relations<br />      that existed with the Chola country, had made their endowments <br />to <br />    the<br />      Siva temples in the Chola country</p>
<p>      In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu <br />Ravi<br />      also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravarti Kulasekaradeva, <br />the<br />      villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named <br />Satanur <br />    in<br />      the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as <br />  Tiruayanisuramudaiya<br />      Nayanar.</p>
<p>      The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the <br />  temple <br />    of<br />      Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) <br />in <br />  the<br />      year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu <br />Ravi <br />    also<br />      gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in<br />      Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870.</p>
<p>      Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907}</p>
<p>      In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his son<br />      Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, <br />who <br />    was<br />      a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of <br />his <br />    rule<br />      the Athitha Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the Chera <br />  king<br />      Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king.</p>
<p>      A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was <br />greatly<br />      instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was <br />rewarded<br />      jointly by the Chola &amp; Chera kings with a crown, palace, <br />  elephants,<br />      royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan Thamil <br />    Verl".</p>
<p>      Towards the middle of Athitha Chola's rule the Chera king <br />Sthani <br />    Ravi<br />      died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara{A.D.885-917} on <br />the<br />      Chera throne.</p>
<p>      During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan <br />    (A.D.860-<br />      905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to <br />them <br />  was<br />      born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920).</p>
<p>      Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907-953}</p>
<p>      Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola <br />(A.D.907-<br />    953)<br />      on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan <br />Adigal<br />      daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. <br />He <br />    also<br />      married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar <br />Kandan<br />      Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the <br />    present<br />      Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a <br />further<br />      queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of <br />the <br />    Venad<br />      King of the Chera country, who refer themselves as "Villavar'.</p>
<p>      Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named<br />      Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a <br />younger <br />    son<br />      by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan.</p>
<p>      A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named <br />Velankumaran<br />      was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the <br />  Prince<br />      Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu.</p>
<p>      Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the <br />Pandiyanadu <br />    waged<br />      war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera king <br />  Rama<br />      Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha.</p>
<p>      Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the<br />      assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with <br />Paranthaha <br />  and<br />      his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma <br />at<br />      Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in <br />Sri<br />      Lanka.</p>
<p>      As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri <br />  Lankan<br />      king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, returned <br />to <br />    the<br />      Chera Country of his mother.</p>
<p>      The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the foremost <br />    among<br />      the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara <br />  dynasty,<br />      paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween <br />these <br />    two<br />      countries to increase many folds. During this period there <br />seems <br />  to<br />      have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola<br />      country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king.</p>
<p>      The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the queen <br />of<br />      Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for <br />lighting<br />      lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year <br />A.D.923.</p>
<p>      In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-arisilar Kumaran a native <br />of <br />  the<br />      Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala country<br />      gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in<br />      Kudumiyam\nmalai in Cholanadu</p>
<p>      In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of <br />Malainadu<br />      gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in <br />    Cholanadu.</p>
<p>      In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold for<br />      lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in <br />Thanjavur.</p>
<p>      She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named<br />      Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During <br />her <br />    time<br />      a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present <br />    Pondicherry)<br />      and named after her as Kokkilanadi-pereri in Chola country.</p>
<p>      There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala <br />    Kurumban<br />      given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha Chola <br />with <br />    the<br />      title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts to the the<br />      temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927.</p>
<p>      In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king<br />      Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier <br />Chera <br />    king<br />      Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for <br />    lighting<br />      lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in <br />  Thondainadu<br />      which was under Chola rule.</p>
<p>      Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu<br />      (Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated <br />a <br />    lamp<br />      to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>      In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince<br />      Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone <br />temple <br />    to<br />      Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in <br />    Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>      Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at <br />Thirumalpuram <br />    in<br />      Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of Kodungolur<br />      (Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948.</p>
<p>      Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the<br />      presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur <br />    A.D.952</p>
<p>      Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama <br />Varma, <br />  the<br />      king Kothai Ravi Varma{A.D.917-947} succeeded on the Chera <br />throne <br />    at<br />      Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country.</p>
<p>      After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by<br />      Indukotha Varma{A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at <br />  Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>      Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957}</p>
<p>      After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola <br />    (A.D..950-<br />      957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with<br />      Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king his<br />      thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious <br />  life,<br />      and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil <br />known<br />      as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the nineth<br />      Thirumurai.)</p>
<p>      Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957}</p>
<p>      He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded <br />to <br />    the<br />      Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king the<br />      Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar.</p>
<p>      Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970}</p>
<p>      With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the Sundera <br />    Chola<br />      ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the <br />    Malaiyaman<br />      king of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar<br />      Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias Thiribhuvanamatheviyar <br />and<br />      also Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and <br />to <br />  the<br />      former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1.</p>
<p>      During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was <br />succeeded by<br />      Bhaskara Ravi Varma -1{A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. Baskara <br />  Ravi<br />      Varma - 2{A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted Bhakara Ravi <br />    Varma ?<br />      1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which stretched from the <br />present<br />      Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region encompassing the <br />Kudamalainadu,<br />      Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-regent probably from Uthahai in <br />the<br />      Kongu region which was under the Chera rule during this period.</p>
<p>      Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985}</p>
<p>      After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 was the<br />      legitimate heir to the Chola throne, but he whole heartedly <br />gave <br />    way<br />      to Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola <br />being<br />      his paternal uncle to rule for some period.</p>
<p>      Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named <br />Panchavanmatheviyar <br />    who<br />      was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar known as <br />Kandan<br />      Sundera Cholan.</p>
<p>      Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014}</p>
<p>      Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by <br />the <br />    heir<br />      apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D.985-1014} on the Chola throne.</p>
<p>      Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman <br />king <br />  of<br />      Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was also <br />as<br />      Thiribhuvanamadevi.</p>
<p>      One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi the daughter of <br />the <br />    king<br />      of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a queen known as<br />      Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />      Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west of <br />Thirutchirappalli<br />      bordering Kerala state. It was to this Vanavanmadevi the <br />greatest<br />      emperor in the Chola history namely the Rajendra Chola ? 1 was <br />    born.</p>
<p>      With the accession of Rajaraja Chola-1 on the Chola throne and <br />  with<br />      his imperialistic ambitions over South India, found that it was<br />      necessary initially to overcome the powerfull Cheras.</p>
<p>      During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the <br />Aye<br />      dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a<br />      military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur <br />Salai<br />      which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced <br />great<br />      trained warriors.</p>
<p>      Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines <br />of<br />      these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera<br />    (Kerala)<br />      country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an<br />      absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern <br />region of<br />      the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull <br />  kings.</p>
<p>      Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />      A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />      acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions <br />  again<br />      in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their <br />  military<br />      acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>      This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali <br />in <br />  the<br />      year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai <br />military<br />      acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of<br />      Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />    Vilignam.</p>
<p>      The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The <br />    Rajaraja<br />      Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village <br />called<br />      Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />      Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>      Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants <br />in <br />    the<br />      year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi <br />    (October/November)<br />      a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />      nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the <br />  God <br />    at<br />      the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river <br />and a<br />      perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p>
<p>      He now turned his attention on his conquest of the territories <br />in <br />    the<br />      Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the <br />    present<br />      Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja-1 thereafter sent an ambassador <br />to <br />    the<br />      co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of Mahodai ruling <br />from<br />      Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as Udagai), namely <br />    Baskara<br />      Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the family of Kulasekaras,<br />      requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty and to pay <br />tributes.</p>
<p>      The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of <br />    Uthahai<br />      and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja Chola-<br />1 <br />    who<br />      sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year <br />A.D.1014<br />      which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears <br />    Baskara<br />      Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu was controlled by <br />    Cholas.</p>
<p>      The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the <br />north <br />  and<br />      central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara Ravivarman<br />      Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the<br />      Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram<br />      (Kodungolur). It appears Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 too accepted <br />the<br />      Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in <br />the<br />      Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the <br />territories <br />  of<br />      Chera country ruled by the other chieftans which were under <br />  Baskara<br />      Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy.</p>
<p>      The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory <br />    (Kolladesam)<br />      and captured the the region along with its seaport capital the <br />    Kollam<br />      (proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain <br />  Govardhana<br />      Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the<br />      Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu.</p>
<p>      Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044}</p>
<p>      Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was <br />succeeeded by<br />      his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a <br />co-<br />      regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012.</p>
<p>      During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year A.D.1019, <br />  with<br />      the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 <br />of<br />      Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his <br />  second<br />      son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who <br />    defeated<br />      the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital <br />  Mahothai<br />      and secured his crown, diadem and an island called <br />Santhimathivu<br />      belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic sea. In <br />this <br />    war<br />      Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death.</p>
<p>      With the his securing of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? 1<br />      assumed the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 <br />gave <br />    the<br />      title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and <br />    appointed<br />      him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu <br />of <br />  the<br />      Kerala country.</p>
<p>      However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war <br />expedition<br />      with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera <br />    country<br />      in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera <br />  Keralan<br />      {A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule on accepting <br />the<br />      Chola suzerainty.</p>
<p>      Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and his<br />      father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at <br />    Jayamaliswarem<br />      in A.D.1023 and built a Salai for providing food named as <br />Chola-<br />      Keralan Chalai and for revenue for its expenses gifted a <br />village<br />      named Chola-Kerala Nallur.</p>
<p>      Rajendra Chola ? 1 in memory of his mother after her death <br />made a<br />      statue of herself and installed at the temple known as <br />    Sembianmathevi<br />      at Nagapattinam and made arrangements for its worship. In Sri <br />  Lanka<br />      too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a temple by the name<br />      Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory.</p>
<p>      Rajendra Chila ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi <br />daughter <br />  of<br />      the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name <br />    Vananvanmadevi<br />      daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur.</p>
<p>      Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as<br />      Gangaikondasolapuram west of present Chidambaram and there he <br />  built<br />      his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" <br />    commemorating<br />      his victory over Kerala kings.</p>
<p>      Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054}</p>
<p>      With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest <br />son <br />  the<br />      Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-regent <br />of<br />      Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. <br />When <br />    he<br />      ascended the throne among the countries that were still under <br />the<br />      Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country.</p>
<p>      During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty at<br />      Mahodai and of Venadu were agitating to get their freedom.<br />      Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which <br />  first<br />      proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera <br />    Keralan<br />      in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant Atthivaranam.</p>
<p>      He appointed Rajasimhan{1028-1043} the son of Vira Kerala as <br />the<br />      Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who <br />    continued<br />      to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had <br />friendly<br />      relations with them for some time.</p>
<p>      This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami <br />Temple at<br />      Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli pandiya was built by the Chera king<br />      Rajasimha, but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. <br />    Rajendra<br />      Chola too has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042</p>
<p>      Further in the 14th year of the Sunder Chola Pandiya devar at <br />    Mannar<br />      Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of the <br />    Chera<br />      king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra Chola<br />      Vinnagar Alvar.</p>
<p>      Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started <br />    agitating<br />      for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda Muvar <br />of <br />    the<br />      region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an expedition <br />to<br />     ; Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from his <br />kingdom <br />  to<br />      the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and Rajadhiraja's <br />    forces<br />      further destroyed the military acadamy and arms centre that <br />became<br />      active again at Kanthalur Sala,i and attacked and defeated <br />  Vilignam<br />      which revived its efforts under Aye kings to become <br />independent, <br />    and<br />      was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam.</p>
<p>      However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule <br />accepting <br />    the<br />      suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. <br />Rajasimha <br />    was<br />      followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082} on the Chera <br />throne.</p>
<p>      Period of Rajendra Chola ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063}</p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle <br />field <br />    at<br />      Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2<br />    {A.D.1051-<br />      1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from <br />    A.D.1051,<br />      crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and <br />continued<br />      with the war with success to Cholas.</p>
<p>      During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola <br />    Keralan<br />      in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the <br />same <br />    title<br />      as Chola Keralan.</p>
<p>      Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1063-1070}</p>
<p>      With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063-<br />1070} <br />    was<br />      crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending <br />the<br />      Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram <br />started<br />      agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. <br />Virarajendra <br />    first<br />      sent an expedition to Venad and killed the younger brother of <br />the<br />      Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king himself escaped <br />from <br />    his<br />      country.</p>
<p>      Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara <br />Ravi ? <br />    2,<br />      it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war <br />  expedition<br />      to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai and<br />      Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. <br />The<br />      Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He <br />defeating<br />      the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants <br />and<br />      maids.</p>
<p>      Period of Adhirajendra Chola {A.D1070-1073}</p>
<p>      With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{A.D1070-<br />1074}<br />      succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-<br />    regent<br />      from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period <br />of <br />  few<br />      months due to illness.</p>
<p>      During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari<br />      Athirajathirajadever who also bore the title "Virakeralan" <br />ruling<br />      from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at<br />      Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps.</p>
<p>      Period of Kulothtunga Chola {A.D1070-1120}</p>
<p>      After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in the <br />    Chola<br />      country with no direct male decendents in the line of the <br />Rajaraja<br />      Chola ? 1 to succeed.</p>
<p>      Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely<br />      Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful heir <br />to <br />    the<br />      chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja in <br />the<br />      year A.D.1074.</p>
<p>      Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the <br />Chera<br />      kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain <br />freedom <br />    from<br />      from the Chola kings.</p>
<p>      Kulothtunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. He<br />      captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of <br />  Kumari<br />      all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a subordinate <br />  king<br />      and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he <br />stationd a<br />      nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under the<br />      general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan.</p>
<p>      Kulothtunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in<br />      Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar <br />forces<br />      (suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his <br />death in<br />      this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma <br />    {A.D.1082-<br />      1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to <br />Cholas.</p>
<p>      He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at<br />      Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 Rama <br />    Varma<br />      Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the Cholas <br />and<br />      regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothtunga <br />Chola<br />  ? <br />    1<br />      didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost territories <br />of <br />    the<br />      Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 <br />years <br />    of<br />      intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras.</p>
<p>      The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more <br />Chola-<br />    Chera<br />      conflicts after Kulothtunga ? 1 during the period of the <br />remaing<br />      Cholas upto A.D.1250</p>

<p>    During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the Aye<br />    dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a<br />    military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur Salai<br />    which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced great<br />    trained warriors.</p>
<p>    Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines of<br />    these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera<br />  (Kerala)<br />    country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an<br />    absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern region of<br />    the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull <br />kings.</p>
<p>    Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />    A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />    acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions <br />again<br />    in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their <br />military<br />    acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>    This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in <br />the<br />    year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military<br />    acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of<br />    Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />  Vilignam.</p>
<p>    The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The <br />  Rajaraja<br />    Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village called<br />    Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />    Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>    Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants in <br />  the<br />    year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi <br />  (October/November)<br />    a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />    nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the <br />God <br />  at<br />    the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river and a<br />    perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p>

<p>    A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY ON MEDIEVAL CHOLAS<br />    AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE CHERAS {KERALAS} OF THE CONTEMPORARY<br />    PERIOD {A.D.801 - A.D 1120}</p>
<p>    Introduction</p>
<p>    During the periods of the nineth and the tenth centuries, the <br />Chera<br />    country was ruled by three principal royal dynasties known as the<br />    Ayes, Venads and Kulasekaras from three distinctive regions of <br />  Kerala<br />    (the Sanskritised version of Chera), and the kings of these three<br />    dynasties and the other Chieftains ruling small regions of rest of<br />    the Kerala, all were generally referred to as the Cheras or <br />Keralas<br />    by the people of Chola &amp; Pandiya countries of this period.</p>
<p>    The Aye dynasty were ruling a region covering from the present<br />    Nagerkoil of Tamil Nadu the southern end of the Aye kingdom, <br />  upwards<br />    into Kerala to the present Anjuthengu in the north of the present<br />    Thiruvananthapuram, and was known as Aye Nadu. Their capital was <br />at<br />    Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye Nadu<br />    also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic studies<br />    acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was located <br />  deep<br />    south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to Nagerkoil <br />  the<br />    southern end of the Aye kingdom.</p>
<p>    The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu covering <br />a<br />    region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as Kollam<br />    Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport city <br />on<br />    the west Kerala.</p>
<p>    The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond <br />  Kottayam<br />    further north upto and around the present region of Kolikkodu<br />    (Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital at<br />    Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as Makothai, <br />  and<br />    a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu country of<br />    that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil Nadu,<br />    bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under their<br />    rule during this period.</p>
<p>    Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory ruled by<br />    Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" under<br />    different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who <br />  accepted<br />    the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their <br />respective<br />    regions as subordinates to them.</p>
<p>    The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya Chola</p>
<p>    Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a <br />  powerful<br />    Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in<br />    Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country covering the length of the <br />    Kolli -<br />    Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his <br />capital<br />    at Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>    He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />    nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur (the<br />    Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the <br />  Pandiya<br />    country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably during<br />    this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the <br />Kulasekara<br />    dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to rule <br />  over<br />    this region.</p>
<p>    Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as an<br />    incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of this <br />  period<br />    referred to him as Kulasekara Perumal in reverence.</p>
<p>    He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in Cholanadu, <br />and<br />    Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, and has<br />    composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu named<br />    as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda Mala". <br />He<br />    abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was venerated <br />as<br />    one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the<br />    Kulasekara Alvar.</p>
<p>    The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. With<br />    the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son <br />Rajasekaran<br />    {A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was also <br />  known<br />    by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an ardent<br />    devotee of God Siva.</p>
<p>    Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram <br />spent<br />    most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at the<br />    Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) in <br />  the<br />    Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great Tamil <br />  Saiva<br />    Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a pilgrimage <br />  to<br />    the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera king<br />    Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva <br />  Saint,<br />    also went to Thiruvarur at this same time.</p>
<p>    Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera king<br />    composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as "Mummanikkovai". <br />From<br />    there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar to <br />  the<br />    Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other Siva<br />    Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further hyms in<br />    Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponnvanna Anthathi"<br />    and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and <br />venerated<br />    as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by him <br />  have<br />    been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a<br />    collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by <br />various<br />    Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala State).</p>
<p>    Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar the<br />    Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the palace <br />  of<br />    this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the Chera<br />    country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam<br />    (Udagai) region of TamilNadu.</p>
<p>    While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar died.<br />    Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the<br />    Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in the<br />    same year.</p>
<p>    It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and partly<br />    during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great Saiva<br />    Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who <br />  founded<br />    the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala.</p>
<p>    It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal from<br />    Venad in the Chera country though not classified under the sixty-<br />    three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by him<br />    named `Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola country,<br />    has been included in the nineth Thirumurai. It appears the Venattu<br />    Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the<br />    Sundaramurthi Nayanar.</p>
<p>    The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was <br />  followed<br />    by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma Kulasekaran <br />(alias<br />    Ko-Kandan) (A.D.844 - 885) on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram.<br />    Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had a daughter <br />by<br />    the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva from another<br />    Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala.</p>
<p>    It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, the <br />  Chola<br />    dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in <br />partial <br />  or<br />    total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for nearly <br />six<br />    centuries.</p>
<p>    Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}</p>
<p>    The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into <br />  prominance<br />    was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}, who ruled the Chola<br />    country from Thanjavur.</p>
<p>    It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very friendly<br />    relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his daughter<br />    both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good <br />relations<br />    that existed with the Chola country, had made their endowments to <br />  the<br />    Siva temples in the Chola country</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu Ravi<br />    also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravarti Kulasekaradeva, the<br />    villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named Satanur <br />  in<br />    the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as <br />Tiruayanisuramudaiya<br />    Nayanar.</p>
<p>    The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the <br />temple <br />  of<br />    Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) in <br />the<br />    year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu Ravi <br />  also<br />    gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in<br />    Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870.</p>
<p>    Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907}</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his son<br />    Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, who <br />  was<br />    a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of his <br />  rule<br />    the Athitha Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the Chera <br />king<br />    Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king.</p>
<p>    A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was greatly<br />    instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was rewarded<br />    jointly by the Chola &amp; Chera kings with a crown, palace, <br />elephants,<br />    royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan Thamil <br />  Verl".</p>
<p>    Towards the middle of Athitha Chola's rule the Chera king Sthani <br />  Ravi<br />    died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara{A.D.885-917} on the<br />    Chera throne.</p>
<p>    During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan <br />  (A.D.860-<br />    905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to them <br />was<br />    born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920).</p>
<p>    Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907-953}</p>
<p>    Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-<br />  953)<br />    on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan Adigal<br />    daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. He <br />  also<br />    married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />    Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the <br />  present<br />    Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a further<br />    queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of the <br />  Venad<br />    King of the Chera country, who refer themselves as "Villavar'.</p>
<p>    Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named<br />    Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a younger <br />  son<br />    by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan.</p>
<p>    A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named Velankumaran<br />    was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the <br />Prince<br />    Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu.</p>
<p>    Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the Pandiyanadu <br />  waged<br />    war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera king <br />Rama<br />    Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha.</p>
<p>    Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the<br />    assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with Paranthaha <br />and<br />    his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma at<br />    Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in Sri<br />    Lanka.</p>
<p>    As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri <br />Lankan<br />    king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, returned to <br />  the<br />    Chera Country of his mother.</p>
<p>    The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the foremost <br />  among<br />    the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara <br />dynasty,<br />    paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween these <br />  two<br />    countries to increase many folds. During this period there seems <br />to<br />    have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola<br />    country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king.</p>
<p>    The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the queen of<br />    Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for lighting<br />    lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year A.D.923.</p>
<p>    In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-arisilar Kumaran a native of <br />the<br />    Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala country<br />    gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in<br />    Kudumiyam\nmalai in Cholanadu</p>
<p>    In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of Malainadu<br />    gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in <br />  Cholanadu.</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold for<br />    lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in Thanjavur.</p>
<p>    She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named<br />    Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During her <br />  time<br />    a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present <br />  Pondicherry)<br />    and named after her as Kokkilanadi-pereri in Chola country.</p>
<p>    There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala <br />  Kurumban<br />    given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha Chola with <br />  the<br />    title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts to the the<br />    temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927.</p>
<p>    In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king<br />    Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier Chera <br />  king<br />    Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for <br />  lighting<br />    lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in <br />Thondainadu<br />    which was under Chola rule.</p>
<p>    Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu<br />    (Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated a <br />  lamp<br />    to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince<br />    Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone temple <br />  to<br />    Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in <br />  Thondaimandalam.</p>
<p>    Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at Thirumalpuram <br />  in<br />    Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of Kodungolur<br />    (Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948.</p>
<p>    Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the<br />    presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur <br />  A.D.952</p>
<p>    Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama Varma, <br />the<br />    king Kothai Ravi Varma{A.D.917-947} succeeded on the Chera throne <br />  at<br />    Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country.</p>
<p>    After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by<br />    Indukotha Varma{A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at <br />Mahodayapuram.</p>
<p>    Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957}</p>
<p>    After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola <br />  (A.D..950-<br />    957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with<br />    Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king his<br />    thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious <br />life,<br />    and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil known<br />    as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the nineth<br />    Thirumurai.)</p>
<p>    Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957}</p>
<p>    He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded to <br />  the<br />    Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king the<br />    Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar.</p>
<p>    Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970}</p>
<p>    With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the Sundera <br />  Chola<br />    ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the <br />  Malaiyaman<br />    king of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar<br />    Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias Thiribhuvanamatheviyar and<br />    also Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and to <br />the<br />    former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1.</p>
<p>    During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was succeeded by<br />    Bhaskara Ravi Varma -1{A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. Baskara <br />Ravi<br />    Varma - 2{A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted Bhakara Ravi <br />  Varma ?<br />    1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which stretched from the present<br />    Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region encompassing the Kudamalainadu,<br />    Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-regent probably from Uthahai in the<br />    Kongu region which was under the Chera rule during this period.</p>
<p>    Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985}</p>
<p>    After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 was the<br />    legitimate heir to the Chola throne, but he whole heartedly gave <br />  way<br />    to Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola being<br />    his paternal uncle to rule for some period.</p>
<p>    Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named Panchavanmatheviyar <br />  who<br />    was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar known as Kandan<br />    Sundera Cholan.</p>
<p>    Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014}</p>
<p>    Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by the <br />  heir<br />    apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D.985-1014} on the Chola throne.</p>
<p>    Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman king <br />of<br />    Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was also as<br />    Thiribhuvanamadevi.</p>
<p>    One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi the daughter of the <br />  king<br />    of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a queen known as<br />    Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of Paluvettaraiyar Kandan<br />    Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west of Thirutchirappalli<br />    bordering Kerala state. It was to this Vanavanmadevi the greatest<br />    emperor in the Chola history namely the Rajendra Chola ? 1 was <br />  born.</p>
<p>    With the accession of Rajaraja Chola-1 on the Chola throne and <br />with<br />    his imperialistic ambitions over South India, found that it was<br />    necessary initially to overcome the powerfull Cheras.</p>
<p>    During the rule of Rajaraja-1 and the earlier Chola kings the Aye<br />    dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built up a<br />    military and Vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur Salai<br />    which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram, and produced great<br />    trained warriors.</p>
<p>    Rajaraja Chola-1 realised the destruction of the supply lines of<br />    these trained warriors and armoury to the Aye kings of Chera<br />  (Kerala)<br />    country and to their Pandiyan ally namely Amarabujangan, was an<br />    absolute necessity initialy in order to win the southern region of<br />    the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by these two powerfull <br />kings.</p>
<p>    Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in<br />    A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military<br />    acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions <br />again<br />    in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their <br />military<br />    acadamy and arsenal centre.</p>
<p>    This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in <br />the<br />    year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military<br />    acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of<br />    Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />  Vilignam.</p>
<p>    The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The <br />  Rajaraja<br />    Chola after his capture of Aye kingdom re-named a village called<br />    Muttam in Valluvanadu into Mummudicholanallur a subdivision of<br />    Rajarja Tennadu (Aye Nadu).</p>
<p>    Here to the temple known as Tirunandikkarai he donated grants in <br />  the<br />    year A.D.1003 and ordered in the month of Iyppasi <br />  (October/November)<br />    a festival to be celebrated ending on the day of Sadaya<br />    nakshaththiram (his birth star), on which day the image of the <br />God <br />  at<br />    the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was to be bathed in the river and a<br />    perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be lit every day.</p>
<p>    He now turned his attention on his conquest of the territories in <br />  the<br />    Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the <br />  present<br />    Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja-1 thereafter sent an ambassador to <br />  the<br />    co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of Mahodai ruling from<br />    Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as Udagai), namely <br />  Baskara<br />    Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the family of Kulasekaras,<br />    requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty and to pay tributes.</p>
<p>    The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of <br />  Uthahai<br />    and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja Chola-1 <br />  who<br />    sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year A.D.1014<br />    which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears <br />  Baskara<br />    Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu was controlled by <br />  Cholas.</p>
<p>    The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the north <br />and<br />    central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara Ravivarman<br />    Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the<br />    Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram<br />    (Kodungolur). It appears Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 too accepted the<br />    Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in the<br />    Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the territories <br />of<br />    Chera country ruled by the other chieftans which were under <br />Baskara<br />    Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy.</p>
<p>    The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory <br />  (Kolladesam)<br />    and captured the the region along with its seaport capital the <br />  Kollam<br />    (proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain <br />Govardhana<br />    Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the<br />    Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu.</p>
<p>    Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044}</p>
<p>    Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was succeeeded by<br />    his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a co-<br />    regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012.</p>
<p>    During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year A.D.1019, <br />with<br />    the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 of<br />    Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his <br />second<br />    son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who <br />  defeated<br />    the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital <br />Mahothai<br />    and secured his crown, diadem and an island called Santhimathivu<br />    belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic sea. In this <br />  war<br />    Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death.</p>
<p>    With the his securing of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? 1<br />    assumed the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 gave <br />  the<br />    title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and <br />  appointed<br />    him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu of <br />the<br />    Kerala country.</p>
<p>    However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war expedition<br />    with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera <br />  country<br />    in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera <br />Keralan<br />    {A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule on accepting the<br />    Chola suzerainty.</p>
<p>    Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and his<br />    father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at <br />  Jayamaliswarem<br />    in A.D.1023 and built a Salai for providing food named as Chola-<br />    Keralan Chalai and for revenue for its expenses gifted a village<br />    named Chola-Kerala Nallur.</p>
<p>    Rajendra Chola ? 1 in memory of his mother after her death made a<br />    statue of herself and installed at the temple known as <br />  Sembianmathevi<br />    at Nagapattinam and made arrangements for its worship. In Sri <br />Lanka<br />    too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a temple by the name<br />    Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory.</p>
<p>    Rajendra Chila ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi daughter <br />of<br />    the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name <br />  Vananvanmadevi<br />    daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur.</p>
<p>    Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as<br />    Gangaikondasolapuram west of present Chidambaram and there he <br />built<br />    his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" <br />  commemorating<br />    his victory over Kerala kings.</p>
<p>    Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054}</p>
<p>    With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest son <br />the<br />    Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-regent of<br />    Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. When <br />  he<br />    ascended the throne among the countries that were still under the<br />    Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country.</p>
<p>    During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty at<br />    Mahodai and of Venadu were agitating to get their freedom.<br />    Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which <br />first<br />    proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera <br />  Keralan<br />    in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant Atthivaranam.</p>
<p>    He appointed Rajasimhan{1028-1043} the son of Vira Kerala as the<br />    Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who <br />  continued<br />    to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had friendly<br />    relations with them for some time.</p>
<p>    This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami Temple at<br />    Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli pandiya was built by the Chera king<br />    Rajasimha, but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. <br />  Rajendra<br />    Chola too has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042</p>
<p>    Further in the 14th year of the Sunder Chola Pandiya devar at <br />  Mannar<br />    Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of the <br />  Chera<br />    king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra Chola<br />    Vinnagar Alvar.</p>
<p>    Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started <br />  agitating<br />    for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda Muvar of <br />  the<br />    region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an expedition to<br />   ; Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from his kingdom <br />to<br />    the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and Rajadhiraja's <br />  forces<br />    further destroyed the military acadamy and arms centre that became<br />    active again at Kanthalur Sala,i and attacked and defeated <br />Vilignam<br />    which revived its efforts under Aye kings to become independent, <br />  and<br />    was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam.</p>
<p>    However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule accepting <br />  the<br />    suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. Rajasimha <br />  was<br />    followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082} on the Chera throne.</p>
<p>    Period of Rajendra Chola ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063}</p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle field <br />  at<br />    Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2<br />  {A.D.1051-<br />    1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from <br />  A.D.1051,<br />    crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and continued<br />    with the war with success to Cholas.</p>
<p>    During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola <br />  Keralan<br />    in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the same <br />  title<br />    as Chola Keralan.</p>
<p>    Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1063-1070}</p>
<p>    With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063-1070} <br />  was<br />    crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending the<br />    Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram started<br />    agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. Virarajendra <br />  first<br />    sent an expedition to Venad and killed the younger brother of the<br />    Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king himself escaped from <br />  his<br />    country.</p>
<p>    Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara Ravi ? <br />  2,<br />    it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war <br />expedition<br />    to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai and<br />    Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. The<br />    Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He defeating<br />    the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants and<br />    maids.</p>
<p>    Period of Adhirajendra Chola {A.D1070-1073}</p>
<p>    With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{A.D1070-1074}<br />    succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-<br />  regent<br />    from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period of <br />few<br />    months due to illness.</p>
<p>    During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari<br />    Athirajathirajadever who also bore the title "Virakeralan" ruling<br />    from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at<br />    Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps.</p>
<p>    Period of Kulothtunga Chola {A.D1070-1120}</p>
<p>    After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in the <br />  Chola<br />    country with no direct male decendents in the line of the Rajaraja<br />    Chola ? 1 to succeed.</p>
<p>    Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely<br />    Kulothtunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful heir to <br />  the<br />    chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja in the<br />    year A.D.1074.</p>
<p>    Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the Chera<br />    kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain freedom <br />  from<br />    from the Chola kings.</p>
<p>    Kulothtunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. He<br />    captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of <br />Kumari<br />    all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a subordinate <br />king<br />    and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he stationd a<br />    nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under the<br />    general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan.</p>
<p>    Kulothtunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in<br />    Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar forces<br />    (suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his death in<br />    this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma <br />  {A.D.1082-<br />    1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to Cholas.</p>
<p>    He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at<br />    Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 Rama <br />  Varma<br />    Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the Cholas and<br />    regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothtunga Chola<br />? <br />  1<br />    didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost territories of <br />  the<br />    Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 years <br />  of<br />    intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras.</p>
<p>    The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more Chola-<br />  Chera<br />    conflicts after Kulothtunga ? 1 during the period of the remaing<br />    Cholas upto A.D.1250</p>
