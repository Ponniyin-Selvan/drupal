<p>If somebody did that to me and my country didn't speak for me, i'd go to where my talents are recognized.</p>
<blockquote><p>    Easier said than done, there are lot of obstacles in going abroad even now, although much easier than before. People like Bose did not even have achance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Religion can be both a motivator as well as a suppressor of talent. Think of the late Ramanujam, intensely religious person who had his complex mathematical theories appearing in dreams from God, was sponsored to go to England and despite his sponsor's best efforts could not adjust to weather/food and returned very sick and died. So young..so brilliant. I had a family member myself too who was similar.</p>
<p>I think we are outgrowing times like this and people are understanding how to be accomodative, adaptable and we have indian communities now in almost all countries.Also to understand, there is as much politics in science as it is in arts or any other field. With technology boom these days it is veryhard to tell which 'one' invention is better than another..and politics follows that dilemma. </p>

<p>-- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Walsingham <deranggen@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Our system is bad, yes, but that doesn't obscure the fact that we have talent. A cursory glance at history will show you that the older the civilisation, the greater the contribution. Have you counted the number of Jewish geniuses? And Judaism is like 4500 years old. We just had the misfortune of having feckless rulers who couldn't distinguish between "veera vilayattu" and the ruthless conquerors who meant business.</p>
<p>  "Basically KARMA (performance without expecting benefit) has gone into our BLOOD .. from time immemorial.. ."</p>
<p>  Yeah, basically we had this habit of attributing everything we do to divine blessings. When will our philosophers realize that God is only a way of dealing with uncertainties, insecurities and thousand other things that come in the way of pure thought? </p>
<p>  In a way it isn't bad. Knowledge belongs to all. Only, i wouldn't be too pleased when somebody steals my paper and announces it as his. The only thing that keeps a scientist going is recognition. A.R.Rahman can do without Oscars, but what if someone steals his music? Will he put it all on Karma and keep playing? Once again a case of not protecting our own.</p>
<p>  I don't give a damn about recognition in the field of arts. It's the fansrecognition that matters, the one and only indicator of a true mastero. It's a matter of taste and A.R.Rahman will remain immortal because of the transcendence of his music, oscar or no oscar. Everybody knows "Slumdog Mill.." was not even close to his best. </p>
<p>  What i'm saying hereafter is totally out of the blue. Just a stray thought.</p>
<p>  I'm saying that achievements in the field of knowledge belong to humankind. Science is one area where we need to breakdown all barriers. But never ever deny due recognition for a scientist. He might have contributed to mankind, but it was HE who did it. We must learn to stand up for them and not brush it off as karma. Marconi stole the radio from J.C.Bose and told blatantly that he did it. If somebody did that to me and my country didn't speak for me, i'd go to where my talents are recognized.</p>
<p>  The ideal way is: Subsidise education globally under a common agency. TheUN can do this, because it's no good at politics. I'm sure most countries would be glad to wash educational responsibility off their hands. People who deal with knowledge shouldn't have to think about sourcing money. Recognition by his peers is the ultimate reward. </p>
<p>  The pursuit of knowledge has the ability to bring the world together. It is the only common cause the world can agree upon. The practitioners of thepure sciences belong to one brotherhood and it is in interests of mankind that no barriers exist between them.</p>
<p>  This is a kind of rant, so please bear with me..</p>

<p>  Hello,</p>
<p>  On Sunday 12 Jul 2009 11:11:48 am Walsingham wrote:<br />    I was just wondering why this system never became popular? We do have a<br />    record of lost legacies. We are the original inventors of the arabic<br />    numeral system, we discovered calculus before newton, we were the<br />    inspiration for the greek philosophy and now we are one of the forerunners<br />    of democracy. Why are we never given credit for such things? Why was Gandhi<br />    never given Nobel Peace Prize? Why wasn't Dr. George Sudarshan recognised?</p>
<p>    Are we too modest, too diffident? Or were we just too maganimous when<br />    others infringed our copyright, so to speak? Oh, this is cool, are we the<br />    forerunners of free and open source knowledge philosophy?</p>
<p>  To answer at least one question, Gandhi was never given the Peace Prize <br />  because he was scheduled to get it in 1948, but he was shot before it could be <br />  awarded. There's a condition in Alfred Nobel's will that says that only living <br />  persons should be awarded the prize. The 1948 prize was _not_ awarded because <br />  "there was no suitable living candidate". They definitely had decided to give <br />  him the prize (which they'd failed to do until then), but they tried to make <br />  up for it.<br />  (<a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html" title="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html</a> for a <br />  citation)...</p>
<p>  With regards to science and technology, this is definitely a field in which we <br />  lag today. Most (not all, obviously) of our scientific "achievements" over the <br />  last few decades seem to be aping the results of others, not original work. <br />  This is mostly due to lack of funding for research. We lack good courses in <br />  either pure or applied sciences at the university level (as opposed to <br />  engineering and technology courses). Arts and science colleges are considered <br />  a step (or three) below "good" engineering colleges, with diluted syllabus and <br />  lackluster staff. I don't expect any great leaps and bounds from this system <br />  as it stands...</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Shashwath</p>

        <p>I think one has to take the long term view on this. Yes, in the short run IT<br />will earn well. They will start off really well and it is much more of an<br />initial struggle in science to finish a phd, a post doc etc. But with the<br />emphasis being placed on science and R &amp; D these days, I believe that things<br />are quite rosy and only going to get better.<br />Regards,</p>

<p>          Yeah, basically we had this habit of attributing everything we do<br />  to<br />      divine blessings. When will our philosophers realize that God is only a<br />  way<br />      of dealing with uncertainties, insecurities and thousand other things<br />  that<br />      come in the way of pure thought?</p>
<p>          In a way it isn't bad. Knowledge belongs to all. Only, i wouldn't<br />  be<br />      too pleased when somebody steals my paper and announces it as his. The<br />  only<br />      thing that keeps a scientist going is recognition. A.R.Rahman can do<br />  without<br />      Oscars, but what if someone steals his music? Will he put it all on<br />  Karma<br />      and keep playing? Once again a case of not protecting our own.</p>
<p>          I don't give a damn about recognition in the field of arts. It's<br />  the<br />      fans recognition that matters, the one and only indicator of a true<br />  mastero.<br />      It's a matter of taste and A.R.Rahman will remain immortal because of<br />  the<br />      transcendence of his music, oscar or no oscar. Everybody knows "Slumdog<br />      Mill.." was not even close to his best.</p>
<p>          What i'm saying hereafter is totally out of the blue. Just a stray<br />      thought.</p>
<p>          I'm saying that achievements in the field of knowledge belong to<br />      humankind. Science is one area where we need to breakdown all barriers.<br />  But<br />      never ever deny due recognition for a scientist. He might have<br />  contributed<br />      to mankind, but it was HE who did it. We must learn to stand up for<br />  them and<br />      not brush it off as karma. Marconi stole the radio from J.C.Bose and<br />  told<br />      blatantly that he did it. If somebody did that to me and my country<br />  didn't<br />      speak for me, i'd go to where my talents are recognized.</p>
<p>          The ideal way is: Subsidise education globally under a common<br />  agency.<br />      The UN can do this, because it's no good at politics. I'm sure most<br />      countries would be glad to wash educational responsibility off their<br />  hands.<br />      People who deal with knowledge shouldn't have to think about sourcing<br />  money.<br />      Recognition by his peers is the ultimate reward.</p>
<p>          The pursuit of knowledge has the ability to bring the world<br />  together.<br />      It is the only common cause the world can agree upon. The practitioners<br />  of<br />      the pure sciences belong to one brotherhood and it is in interests of<br />      mankind that no barriers exist between them.</p>
<p>          This is a kind of rant, so please bear with me..</p>

<p>          Hello,</p>
<p>          On Sunday 12 Jul 2009 11:11:48 am Walsingham wrote:<br />            I was just wondering why this system never became popular? We do<br />  have<br />      a<br />            record of lost legacies. We are the original inventors of the<br />  arabic<br />            numeral system, we discovered calculus before newton, we were the<br />            inspiration for the greek philosophy and now we are one of the<br />      forerunners<br />            of democracy. Why are we never given credit for such things? Why<br />  was<br />      Gandhi<br />            never given Nobel Peace Prize? Why wasn't Dr. George Sudarshan<br />      recognised?</p>
<p>            Are we too modest, too diffident? Or were we just too maganimous<br />  when<br />            others infringed our copyright, so to speak? Oh, this is cool,<br />  are we<br />      the<br />            forerunners of free and open source knowledge philosophy?</p>
<p>          To answer at least one question, Gandhi was never given the Peace<br />  Prize</p>
<p>          because he was scheduled to get it in 1948, but he was shot before<br />  it<br />      could be<br />          awarded. There's a condition in Alfred Nobel's will that says that<br />  only<br />      living<br />          persons should be awarded the prize. The 1948 prize was _not_<br />  awarded<br />      because<br />          "there was no suitable living candidate". They definitely had<br />  decided<br />      to give<br />          him the prize (which they'd failed to do until then), but they<br />  tried to<br />      make<br />          up for it.<br />          (<br />  <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.htmlfor" title="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.htmlfor">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.htmlfor</a> a</p>
<p>          citation)...</p>
<p>          With regards to science and technology, this is definitely a field<br />  in<br />      which we<br />          lag today. Most (not all, obviously) of our scientific<br />  "achievements"<br />      over the<br />          last few decades seem to be aping the results of others, not<br />  original<br />      work.<br />          This is mostly due to lack of funding for research. We lack good<br />      courses in<br />          either pure or applied sciences at the university level (as opposed<br />  to<br />          engineering and technology courses). Arts and science colleges are<br />      considered<br />          a step (or three) below "good" engineering colleges, with diluted<br />      syllabus and<br />          lackluster staff. I don't expect any great leaps and bounds from<br />  this<br />      system<br />          as it stands...</p>

<p>        What i'm saying hereafter is totally out of the blue. Just a stray<br />    thought.</p>
<p>        I'm saying that achievements in the field of knowledge belong to<br />    humankind. Science is one area where we need to breakdown all barriers.But<br />    never ever deny due recognition for a scientist. He might have contributed<br />    to mankind, but it was HE who did it. We must learn to stand up for them and<br />    not brush it off as karma. Marconi stole the radio from J.C.Bose and told<br />    blatantly that he did it. If somebody did that to me and my country didn't<br />    speak for me, i'd go to where my talents are recognized.</p>
<p>        The ideal way is: Subsidise education globally under a common agency.<br />    The UN can do this, because it's no good at politics. I'm sure most<br />    countries would be glad to wash educational responsibility off their hands.<br />    People who deal with knowledge shouldn't have to think about sourcing money.<br />    Recognition by his peers is the ultimate reward.</p>
<p>        The pursuit of knowledge has the ability to bring the world together.<br />    It is the only common cause the world can agree upon. The practitionersof<br />    the pure sciences belong to one brotherhood and it is in interests of<br />    mankind that no barriers exist between them.</p>
<p>        This is a kind of rant, so please bear with me..</p>

<p>        Hello,</p>
<p>        On Sunday 12 Jul 2009 11:11:48 am Walsingham wrote:<br />          I was just wondering why this system never became popular? We do have<br />    a<br />          record of lost legacies.

Why are we never given credit for such things? Why was<br />    Gandhi<br />          never given Nobel Peace Prize? Why wasn't Dr. George Sudarshan<br />    recognised?</p>
<p>          Are we too modest, too diffident? Or were we just too maganimous when<br />          others infringed our copyright, so to speak? Oh, this is cool, are we<br />    the<br />          forerunners of free and open source knowledge philosophy?</p>
<p>        To answer at least one question, Gandhi was never given the Peace Prize</p>
<p>        because he was scheduled to get it in 1948, but he was shot before it<br />    could be<br />        awarded. There's a condition in Alfred Nobel's will that says that only<br />    living<br />        persons should be awarded the prize. The 1948 prize was _not_ awarded<br />    because<br />        "there was no suitable living candidate". They definitely had decided<br />    to give<br />        him the prize (which they'd failed to do until then), but they tried to<br />    make<br />        up for it.<br />        (<a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.htmlfor" title="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.htmlfor">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.htmlfor</a> a<br />        citation)...</p>
<p>        With regards to science and technology, this is definitely a field in<br />    which we<br />        lag today. Most (not all, obviously) of our scientific "achievements"<br />    over the<br />        last few decades seem to be aping the results of others, not original<br />    work.<br />        This is mostly due to lack of funding for research. We lack good<br />    courses in<br />        either pure or applied sciences at the university level (as opposedto<br />        engineering and technology courses). Arts and science colleges are<br />    considered<br />        a step (or three) below "good" engineering colleges, with diluted<br />    syllabus and<br />        lackluster staff. I don't expect any great leaps and bounds from this<br />    system<br />        as it stands...</p>

          Rants on science and education        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Don't get me started on our lack of science. *sigh* We find it so difficult<br />to find motivated scientists. Everyone wants to go the IT route. The thing<br />is, at one level I don't blame them. People go where the money is. However,<br />we are sorely lacking in the basic sciences. If you compare us against<br />China, that's the big difference. I can see it in my own company (biotech).<br />Most of the IT folks in the US are from India, most of the scientists are<br />from China.<br />I try and talk to young boys and girls doing their 12th to take up science<br />as a career. The thing is, a career in science pays just as well, if not<br />better than IT. It is just that the beginning is a little more difficult.<br />However, I personally feel that the IT salaries plateau out faster than for<br />the science streams.</p>
<p>Talking of the scientific spirit though I believe that our Bhakti movements<br />might have had a lot to do with our losing out on science. I know this is<br />probably going to stir up a hornet's nest, but i find it incredible that<br />there are so few old science texts after the 12th odd century (and almost<br />none in Tamizh). There were the Kerala mathematicians in the 15th century<br />but apart from that, it looks like Bhakti emasculated Science!</p>

<p>    Hi Walasingham -</p>
<p>    If somebody did that to me and my country didn't speak for me, i'd go to<br />  where my talents are recognized.<br />        Easier said than done, there are lot of obstacles in going abroad<br />  even now, although much easier than before. People like Bose did not even<br />  have a chance.</p>
<p>    Religion can be both a motivator as well as a suppressor of talent. Think<br />  of the late Ramanujam, intensely religious person who had his complex<br />  mathematical theories appearing in dreams from God, was sponsored to go to<br />  England and despite his sponsor's best efforts could not adjust to<br />  weather/food and returned very sick and died. So young..so brilliant. I had<br />  a family member myself too who was similar.</p>
<p>    I think we are outgrowing times like this and people are understanding<br />  how to be accomodative, adaptable and we have indian communities now in<br />  almost all countries.Also to understand, there is as much politics in<br />  science as it is in arts or any other field. With technology boom these days<br />  it is very hard to tell which 'one' invention is better than another..and<br />  politics follows that dilemma.</p>

<p>      Our system is bad, yes, but that doesn't obscure the fact that we have<br />  talent. A cursory glance at history will show you that the older the<br />  civilisation, the greater the contribution. Have you counted the number of<br />  Jewish geniuses? And Judaism is like 4500 years old. We just had the<br />  misfortune of having feckless rulers who couldn't distinguish between "veera<br />  vilayattu" and the ruthless conquerors who meant business.</p>
<p>      "Basically KARMA (performance without expecting benefit) has gone into<br />  our BLOOD .. from time immemorial.. ."</p>
<p>      Yeah, basically we had this habit of attributing everything we do to<br />  divine blessings. When will our philosophers realize that God is only a way<br />  of dealing with uncertainties, insecurities and thousand other things that<br />  come in the way of pure thought?</p>
<p>      In a way it isn't bad. Knowledge belongs to all. Only, i wouldn't be<br />  too pleased when somebody steals my paper and announces it as his. The only<br />  thing that keeps a scientist going is recognition. A.R.Rahman can do without<br />  Oscars, but what if someone steals his music? Will he put it all on Karma<br />  and keep playing? Once again a case of not protecting our own.</p>
<p>      I don't give a damn about recognition in the field of arts. It's the<br />  fans recognition that matters, the one and only indicator of a true mastero.<br />  It's a matter of taste and A.R.Rahman will remain immortal because of the<br />  transcendence of his music, oscar or no oscar.

<p>  Religion can be both a motivator as well as a suppressor of talent. Thinkof the late Ramanujam, intensely religious person who had his complex mathematical theories appearing in dreams from God, was sponsored to go to England and despite his sponsor's best efforts could not adjust to weather/foodand returned very sick and died. So young..so brilliant. I had a family member myself too who was similar.</p>
<p>  I think we are outgrowing times like this and people are understanding how to be accomodative, adaptable and we have indian communities now in almost all countries.Also to understand, there is as much politics in science asit is in arts or any other field. With technology boom these days it is very hard to tell which 'one' invention is better than another..and politics follows that dilemma. </p>

<p>    Our system is bad, yes, but that doesn't obscure the fact that we have talent. A cursory glance at history will show you that the older the civilisation, the greater the contribution. Have you counted the number of Jewishgeniuses? And Judaism is like 4500 years old. We just had the misfortune of having feckless rulers who couldn't distinguish between "veera vilayattu"and the ruthless conquerors who meant business.</p>
<p>    "Basically KARMA (performance without expecting benefit) has gone into our BLOOD .. from time immemorial.. ."</p>
<p>    Yeah, basically we had this habit of attributing everything we do to divine blessings. When will our philosophers realize that God is only a way of dealing with uncertainties, insecurities and thousand other things that come in the way of pure thought? </p>
<p>    In a way it isn't bad. Knowledge belongs to all. Only, i wouldn't be too pleased when somebody steals my paper and announces it as his. The only thing that keeps a scientist going is recognition. A.R.Rahman can do withoutOscars, but what if someone steals his music? Will he put it all on Karma and keep playing? Once again a case of not protecting our own.</p>
<p>    I don't give a damn about recognition in the field of arts. It's the fans recognition that matters, the one and only indicator of a true mastero. It's a matter of taste and A.R.Rahman will remain immortal because of the transcendence of his music, oscar or no oscar. Everybody knows "Slumdog Mill.." was not even close to his best. </p>
<p>    What i'm saying hereafter is totally out of the blue. Just a stray thought.</p>
<p>    I'm saying that achievements in the field of knowledge belong to humankind. Science is one area where we need to breakdown all barriers. But neverever deny due recognition for a scientist. He might have contributed to mankind, but it was HE who did it. We must learn to stand up for them and notbrush it off as karma. Marconi stole the radio from J.C.Bose and told blatantly that he did it. If somebody did that to me and my country didn't speak for me, i'd go to where my talents are recognized.</p>
<p>    The ideal way is: Subsidise education globally under a common agency. The UN can do this, because it's no good at politics. I'm sure most countries would be glad to wash educational responsibility off their hands. People who deal with knowledge shouldn't have to think about sourcing money. Recognition by his peers is the ultimate reward. </p>
<p>    The pursuit of knowledge has the ability to bring the world together. It is the only common cause the world can agree upon. The practitioners of the pure sciences belong to one brotherhood and it is in interests of mankind that no barriers exist between them.</p>
<p>    This is a kind of rant, so please bear with me..</p>

<p>    Hello,</p>
<p>    On Sunday 12 Jul 2009 11:11:48 am Walsingham wrote:<br />      I was just wondering why this system never became popular? We do havea<br />      record of lost legacies. We are the original inventors of the arabic<br />      numeral system, we discovered calculus before newton, we were the<br />      inspiration for the greek philosophy and now we are one of the forerunners<br />      of democracy. Why are we never given credit for such things? Why was Gandhi<br />      never given Nobel Peace Prize? Why wasn't Dr. George Sudarshan recognised?</p>
<p>      Are we too modest, too diffident? Or were we just too maganimous when<br />      others infringed our copyright, so to speak? Oh, this is cool, are wethe<br />      forerunners of free and open source knowledge philosophy?</p>
<p>    To answer at least one question, Gandhi was never given the Peace Prize <br />    because he was scheduled to get it in 1948, but he was shot before it could be <br />    awarded. There's a condition in Alfred Nobel's will that says that onlyliving <br />    persons should be awarded the prize. The 1948 prize was _not_ awarded because <br />    "there was no suitable living candidate". They definitely had decided to give <br />    him the prize (which they'd failed to do until then), but they tried tomake <br />    up for it.<br />    (<a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html" title="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/index.html</a> for a <br />    citation)...</p>
<p>    With regards to science and technology, this is definitely a field in which we <br />    lag today. Most (not all, obviously) of our scientific "achievements" over the <br />    last few decades seem to be aping the results of others, not original work. <br />    This is mostly due to lack of funding for research. We lack good courses in <br />    either pure or applied sciences at the university level (as opposed to <br />    engineering and technology courses). Arts and science colleges are considered <br />    a step (or three) below "good" engineering colleges, with diluted syllabus and <br />    lackluster staff. I don't expect any great leaps and bounds from this system <br />    as it stands...</p>
