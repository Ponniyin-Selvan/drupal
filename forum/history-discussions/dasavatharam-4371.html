<p>Hi sps sir</p>
<p>If you look at this panel in isolation - its looks like three <br />distinguished visitors are waiting on the seated saint...however, as <br />i had mentioned earlier - this panel forms a part of the story <br />board. this is just one scene...the entire story of tripurantaka is <br />sculpted in this panel - total i think is 8 parts. maybe next time <br />you go to tanjore ( this weekend) you can take the picture and post <br />it here.</p>

<p>   Am glad we are not arguing theologies. <br />   ? <br />   Yes I agree 100% on the usage of the word Buddha as well as <br />  Avathar.

What we wish to believe <br />  sentimentally is besides the point,. Puranas are not history, they <br />  are a mix of historical events with mythological allegories, we will <br />  never be able to prove anyone is an 'avatar', or even a 'saint', we <br />  accord those terms to people we think are a certain way and that <br />  will always be a matter of dispute. </p>

<p>   There are thousands of avatars,technically even RRC/RJC etc were <br />   such. Consider the manifestation as a concept of equilibirium. <br />   Only in these 10, midst of a select few, the sense and purpose was <br />   documented. </p>

<p>   There seems to be no concrete evidence that Gauthama was a vishnu <br />   incarnate. If there is, it would be good if any forum member can <br />   share the info. </p>

<p>     Hi Vijay </p>
<p>     now we have 2 entirely different propositions </p>
<p>     A) there could be more than 10 avatars </p>
<p>     B) there could be more than 1 buddha </p>
<p>     my question is when was the word dasavatharam mentioned first? <br />  any <br />     idea. </p>
<p>     we need to agree that buddha was not a 9th century phenomenon to <br />   be <br />     juxtaposed in the other avathars. he was as much in the past as <br />     krishna to those in mallai or thanjchai . </p>
<p>     if we find an answer to the above i think we owe one to kamal <br />  for <br />     stirring it up. <br />     venketesh </p>

<p>           The above is as recorded in Srimadh Bhagavatham. So this <br />   Buddha <br />     of <br />           Vishnu is definitely different from the Gauthama Buddha. <br />  The <br />     later <br />           day (but as early as Pallava sculptures) artists could <br />  have <br />           misconstrued this to be Gauthama Buddha and hence we see <br />  him <br />   in <br />     the <br />           10 Avatars list. </p>
<p>         Great hypothesis. </p>

<p>  There seems to be no concrete evidence that Gauthama was a vishnu <br />  incarnate. If there is, it would be good if any forum member can <br />  share the info.</p>

<p>    Hi Vijay</p>
<p>    now we have 2 entirely different propositions</p>
<p>    A) there could be more than 10 avatars</p>
<p>    B) there could be more than 1 buddha</p>
<p>    my question is when was the word dasavatharam mentioned first? <br />any <br />    idea.</p>
<p>    we need to agree that buddha was not a 9th century phenomenon to <br />  be <br />    juxtaposed in the other avathars. he was as much in the past as <br />    krishna to those in mallai or thanjchai .</p>
<p>    if we find an answer to the above i think we owe one to kamal <br />for <br />    stirring it up.<br />    venketesh</p>

<p>          The above is as recorded in Srimadh Bhagavatham. So this <br />  Buddha <br />    of <br />          Vishnu is definitely different from the Gauthama Buddha. <br />The <br />    later <br />          day (but as early as Pallava sculptures) artists could <br />have <br />          misconstrued this to be Gauthama Buddha and hence we see <br />him <br />  in <br />    the <br />          10 Avatars list.</p>
<p>        Great hypothesis. </p>

I would always go by rrc n mahendra's <br />version...they <br />    alone were colossol spiritual greats but combine them with the <br />kind <br />    of people / saints / gurus they grew with, what we hv now is <br />    miniscule in whatever terms ...

        <p>Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>The straight answer could be, there are no definite timelines for <br />any Puranas, be it Vishnu Purana or Garuda Purana or any thing. Ask <br />any religiously inclined person, he will readily say that it was <br />there even before "kritha yuga". And as some one wrote very aptly, <br />Puranas are a little history with some mythical allegories embedded. <br />So there is no point in trying to ascertain the timelines of any <br />Puranas. </p>

<p>avatar too. But is there any 'evidence' that any human being <br />historically was a 'vishnu avatar'? What we wish to believe <br />sentimentally is besides the point,. Puranas are not history, they <br />are a mix of historical events with mythological allegories, we will <br />never be able to prove anyone is an 'avatar', or even a 'saint', we <br />accord those terms to people we think are a certain way and that <br />will always be a matter of dispute.</p>

          Dasavatharam        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>All,</p>
<p>There is something more to this in Srimadh Bhagavatham than what I <br />wrote earlier. </p>
<p>First let me take the issue of Gauthama Buddha Vs the Buddha <br />mentioned in Srimadh Bhagavatham. I did read some posts, like the <br />one from our Vijay, in which it is clearly indicated that the Buddha <br />was born in Magadha etc., definitely pointing towards Gauthama <br />Buddha. But incidentally, I referred to a very old reprinted edition <br />of Srimadh Bhagavatham by "The Geetha Press" in Gujarat and I could <br />not find any reference to Gauthama Buddha in that. So the question <br />seems to be hanging now in balance. And one more confusion as to <br />which is the Authentic Srimadh Bhagavatham. I have to say sorry that <br />I am not much qualified to infer on this. So I leave it with that <br />ambiguity for other learned members to talk about it.</p>
<p>However the most interesting note that I read is that, it also <br />lists, not 21 but close to 28 avatars of Vishnu, while also <br />mentioning that "In Reality His (Vishnu's) Avatars are countless". <br />Some of the mentioned Avataras are as follows:-</p>
<p>1. SanakAthi Munivar (The four sons of Brahma counted as 1 avatar)<br />2. Narada<br />3. Kapila<br />4. Dattatreya<br />5. Prishnigarbha (Son of Prishni - Sorry, no idea who is Prishni)<br />6. Rishabha (Proabably the first thIrthankar of the Jains)<br />7. Vyasa<br />8. Nara-Narayana (As in Badrinath)<br />9. Yagna (A temporary replacement of Indra)<br />10. King Prithu (after whom the earth was called as Prithvi)<br />11. Dhanvathari (the God of Medicines)<br />12. Mohini (During the pARkkaDal kaDaithal)<br />13. Matsya<br />14. Kurma<br />15. Varaha<br />16. Narasimha<br />17. Vamana<br />18. Parasurama<br />19. Rama<br />20. Balarama<br />21. Krishna<br />22. Buddha (Gauthama or Different)<br />23. Kalki <br />24. Hayagriva (the Horse headed God of "GnyAna")<br />25. Hamsa (The Swan)<br />26. The Avatar to project the elephant Gajendra from the Crocodile<br />27. The Avatar when He appeared in front of Dhruva to grant Moksha<br />28. Purusha </p>
<p>Let us see to other references of these avatars. As Vishnu is <br />considered to be the protector amongst the trinity, it is said that <br />any King is supposed to be an incarnation of Vishnu, Logically. <br />Remember our AMV being spoken of in this manner, with Sangu Chakra <br />rEgais in his hand. That was no passing mention. </p>
<p>Nammazhwar says in his Thiruvaimozhi....</p>
<p>"thiruvuDai mannaraik kANil, thirumAlaik kaNDEnE enRum..."<br />(the mother of the thalavi, here Nammazhwar in peN bhAvam, says that <br />the thalavi has become so mad that whenever she sees any Righteous <br />(the adjective "thiruvuDai" is very apt here for this)king, she <br />thinks of him to be ThirumAl) </p>
<p>Nammazhwar in his Thiruviruttham, expands this further as...</p>
<p>".... en ninRa yOniyumAip piRandhAi, imayOrth thalaivaa....."</p>
<p>meaning, He is born in numerous forms, as confirmed by the usage of <br />the word "en ninRa yOni".</p>
<p>So much for the incarnations, let us see about the Buddha Avatar.</p>
<p>Nammazhwar also makes a reference to Buddha Avatar in his <br />Thiruvaimozhi, though not explicitly.</p>
<p>" kaLLa vEDathaik koNdu pOi, puRampukkavARum - kalandhu asurarai<br />uLLam bEdham seidhiTTU uyiruNda upAyangaLum....."</p>
<p>Here he refers to Buddha Avatar, as I mentioned in my earlier post, <br />that He deceived the Asuras. "kaLLa vEDam" refers to the deceiving <br />form that He had taken. The word "kalandhu" refers to the fact that <br />He mixes with those Asuras and "uLLam bEdham seidhiTTu" refers to <br />the actual act of deception.</p>
<p>This is probably the only reference to Buddha Avatar from <br />the "nAlAyira divya prabhandham" and this does not talk directly <br />about whether it is a different Buddha or Gauthama Buddha.</p>
<p>So I stop with some definite ambiguity here.</p>

<p>  now we have 2 entirely different propositions</p>

<p>  my question is when was the word dasavatharam mentioned first? any <br />  idea.</p>
<p>  we need to agree that buddha was not a 9th century phenomenon to <br />be <br />  juxtaposed in the other avathars. he was as much in the past as <br />  krishna to those in mallai or thanjchai .</p>

<p>        The above is as recorded in Srimadh Bhagavatham. So this <br />Buddha <br />  of <br />        Vishnu is definitely different from the Gauthama Buddha. The <br />  later <br />        day (but as early as Pallava sculptures) artists could have <br />        misconstrued this to be Gauthama Buddha and hence we see him <br />in <br />  the <br />        10 Avatars list.</p>
<p>      Great hypothesis. </p>
<p>      now vijay whats your opinion on this?</p>
<p>      venketesh</p>
<p>    hi<br />    I hv the greatest of respect for all faiths ...but look at it <br />  purely based on info b4 u...</p>
<p>    By your own words buddha is an incarnation of vishnu....that <br />this <br />  buddha is not that buddha is not the question. The same mallai <br />sirpi <br />  sculpted the magnificient govardhana panel...depicting krishna in <br />all <br />  his glory true to the minutest detail as sung by alwars....but did <br />  not mention kishna avatar in the inscription....how do you justify <br />  that.</p>
<p>    Similarly, pl refer the iconography of the brihadesvara <br />temple ... <br />  Dr francoise l'hernault... <br />    Page 29.. And plates 9 ( southern stairway of vestibule) and <br />plate <br />  16 ( inner gateway west facade)due copyright I can't put the <br />images <br />  here, but anyone fm tanjore cn check... The buddha is depicted in <br />  these two panels under a tree _ seated..I would like you study <br />these <br />  panels and come to a conclusion. The extent to which raja raja <br />  immersed into shiva n the legends associated with him is not for <br />us <br />  to fathom... We will never know what info was available to them <br />those <br />  days ..but one thing is for sure, if we are talking of evidence fm <br />  literature ...

<p>Avatars of Vishnu in the Bhagavata Purana</p>
<p>Deity form of Varaha from Khajuraho, 12th C AD <br />DattatreyaTwenty-two avatars of Vishnu are listed numerically in the <br />first Canto of the Bhagavata Purana as follows:</p>
<p>Catursana [SB 1.3.6] (The Four Sons of Brahma) <br />Varaha [SB 1.3.7] (The boar) <br />Narada [SB 1.3.8] (The Traveling Sage) <br />Nara-Narayana [SB 1.3.9] (The Twins) <br />Kapila [SB 1.3.10] (The Philosopher) <br />Dattatreya [SB 1.3.11] (Combined Avatar of The Trimurti) <br />Yajna [SB 1.3.12] (Vishnu temporarily taking the role of Indra) <br />Rishabha [SB 1.3.13] (Father of King Bharata) <br />Prithu [SB 1.3.14] (King who made earth Beautiful and Attractive) <br />Matsya [SB 1.3.15] (The Fish) <br />Kurma [SB 1.3.16] (The Tortoise) <br />Dhanvantari [SB 1.3.17] (Father of Ayurveda) <br />Mohini [SB 1.3.17] (Beautiful/Charming Woman) <br />Narasimha [SB 1.3.18] (The Man-Lion) <br />Vamana [SB 1.3.19] (The Dwarf) <br />Parasurama [SB 1.3.20] (The Rama with an Axe) <br />Vyasa [SB 1.3.21] (Compiler of the Vedas) <br />Rama [SB 1.3.22] (The King of Ayodhya) <br />Balarama [SB 1.3.23] (Krishna's Elder Brother) <br />Krishna [SB 1.3.23] (The Cowherd) <br />Buddha [SB 1.3.24] (The Deluder) <br />Kalki [SB 1.3.25] (The Destroyer) <br />Besides these, another three avatars are described later on in the <br />text as follows:</p>
<p>Prshnigarbha [SB 10.3.41] (Born to Prshni) <br />Hayagriva [SB 2.7.11] (The Horse) <br />Hamsa [SB 11.13.19] (The Swan) <br />After Kalki avatar] is described in the Bhagavata Purana it is <br />declared that the avatars of Vishnu are 'Innumerable.'[6] However <br />the above list of twenty-five avatars are generally taken as those <br />of greatest significance.</p>
<p>According to Gaudiya Vaishnava interpretation of a verse in the <br />latter texts of the Bhagavata Purana,[7] and a number of texts from <br />the Mahabharata and other Puranic scriptures,[8] Chaitanya <br />Mahaprabhu is also listed as an avatar and is worshiped as such by <br />followers of the tradition. In this connection Chaitanya is often <br />referred to as the Golden Avatar.</p>

        <p>Venkat, sorry I did not get/see your post and I thought Ravi was replying to me.<br />?<br />As far as my limited knowledge goes, the dasavataram along with the remaining 11 are first mentioned in Garuda Purana, which is supposedly a 'bad purana' (only to be read in funerals). My grandmother tells me there are always21, 10 were taken out as a convenient subset.<br />?<br />I have no idea of timelines on Garuda Purana, vaishavite experts can throw some light on that.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Am glad we are not arguing theologies.<br />?<br />Yes I agree 100% on the usage of the word Buddha as well as Avathar. Yes there is no evidence that Gautama Buddha was a vishnu avatar too. But is there any 'evidence' that any human being historically was a 'vishnu avatar'? What we wish to believe sentimentally is besides the point,. Puranas are nothistory, they are a mix of historical events with mythological allegories,we will never be able to prove anyone is an 'avatar', or even a 'saint', we accord those terms to people we think are a certain way and that will always be a matter of dispute.</p>

        <p>Am glad we are not arguing theologies.<br />?<br />Yes I agree 100% on the usage of the word Buddha as well as Avathar. Yes there is no evidence that Gautama Buddha was a vishnu avatar too. But is there any 'evidence' that any human being historically was a 'vishnu avatar'? What we wish to believe sentimentally is besides the point,. Puranas are nothistory, they are a mix of historical events with mythological allegories,we will never be able to prove anyone is an 'avatar', or even a 'saint', we accord those terms to people we think are a certain way and that will always be a matter of dispute.</p>

        <p>Ravi, my conclusion is that it does not matter if he was an avatar of the creative or protective force. It is even debatable if these forces are some distinct separate entities or aspects of the same entity.As you said for Gandhi, if the Buddha did not believe in the vedas,so what? What he taught otherwise far outweighed any other considerations. A belief is only somethingthat leads to an action, and blind belief in vedas can be equally disastrous as blind belief in anything else.<br />?<br />I would very much like to answer your other questions but this is not a theological forum, and I do not wish to be stuck in?a stance with noone elseopening their mouths and then people get upset that the harmony of the forum is gone because of that.<br />?<br />Stopping here for good I hope.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

As <br />everybody <br />    know<br />        Adishankarar who did lot of reformations, created 5 madhams. <br />If <br />      Buddha<br />        was Vishnu's avatar he would not have commented like that.</p>

        <p>All I can say is that there is nothing wrong with worship of nature and worshipping God as a formless entity. The Buddha is a highly respected figure among many hindus, including several freedom fighters, authors including kalki.<br />?<br />.Buddha and Adi Sankara have more parellels than differences, it is ridiculous to say Sankara took birth to get rid of the 'adharma' propogated duringBuddha's times.<br />?<br />I did not wish to say more but one should avoid putting down great figures with little thought.</p>

Nothing, vastness, the great 'mounam' whatever you call it can only be experienced, not defined and limited in words.<br />?<br />2 Why do people say they know nothing when they are really educated? It depends on what people you are referring to - the great gnanis, Buddha, RamanaMaharishi, Ramakrishna all claimed to know 'nothing' or that 'nothing can be taught' for the same reason, that what they experienced is only experiential and impossible to contain in words. In fact when J Krishnamoorthy started teaching he also asked the same thing 'what is there to teach?'.<br />?<br />At a more basic level, since this is not a philosophy, theological forum - this debate goes back to form/formless, dwaita and adwaita. Buddhism and Adwaita have a lot in common,?except that Adi Sankara believed it is very hard for an ordinary believer to start with belief in the formless, Buddha thought?it can be started that way. Dwaita, or form theory has lots of parellels to dualistic abrahamic religions.<br />?<br />There are no answers to whether or not Buddha was a 9th avatar, to me, it does not matter. What he taught far outweights all these questions. <br />?<br />I will stop here,do not wish to be drawn into any theological debate. <br />?<br />Buddham Saranam Gachaami, Namo Narayana.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

        <p>Hi Vijay</p>
<p>now we have 2 entirely different propositions</p>
<p>A) there could be more than 10 avatars</p>
<p>B) there could be more than 1 buddha</p>
<p>my question is when was the word dasavatharam mentioned first? any <br />idea.</p>
<p>we need to agree that buddha was not a 9th century phenomenon to be <br />juxtaposed in the other avathars. he was as much in the past as <br />krishna to those in mallai or thanjchai .</p>
<p>if we find an answer to the above i think we owe one to kamal for <br />stirring it up.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>      The above is as recorded in Srimadh Bhagavatham. So this Buddha <br />of <br />      Vishnu is definitely different from the Gauthama Buddha. The <br />later <br />      day (but as early as Pallava sculptures) artists could have <br />      misconstrued this to be Gauthama Buddha and hence we see him in <br />the <br />      10 Avatars list.</p>
<p>    Great hypothesis. </p>
<p>    now vijay whats your opinion on this?</p>
<p>    venketesh</p>
<p>  hi<br />  I hv the greatest of respect for all faiths ...but look at it <br />purely based on info b4 u...</p>
<p>  By your own words buddha is an incarnation of vishnu....that this <br />buddha is not that buddha is not the question. The same mallai sirpi </p></blockquote>
<p>sculpted the magnificient govardhana panel...depicting krishna in all <br />his glory true to the minutest detail as sung by alwars....but did <br />not mention kishna avatar in the inscription....how do you justify <br />that.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Similarly, pl refer the iconography of the brihadesvara temple ... <br />Dr francoise l'hernault... <br />  Page 29.. And plates 9 ( southern stairway of vestibule) and plate <br />16 ( inner gateway west facade)due copyright I can't put the images </p></blockquote>
<p>here, but anyone fm tanjore cn check... The buddha is depicted in <br />these two panels under a tree _ seated..I would like you study these <br />panels and come to a conclusion. The extent to which raja raja <br />immersed into shiva n the legends associated with him is not for us <br />to fathom... We will never know what info was available to them those <br />days ..but one thing is for sure, if we are talking of evidence fm <br />literature ... I would always go by rrc n mahendra's version...they <br />alone were colossol spiritual greats but combine them with the kind <br />of people / saints / gurus they grew with, what we hv now is <br />miniscule in whatever terms ... Info, understanding , content , <br />avaliability of text n lastly truly enlightened souls..</p>

        <p>Another version why Buddha is not Vishnu Avatar, again spiritual no proof.</p>
<p>Adishankarar seem to have commented that the one of the principles of<br />Budda which is "Everthing is Soonyam" is wrong. Soonyam is nothing and<br />this world would have not have come from nothing. As everybody know<br />Adishankarar who did lot of reformations, created 5 madhams. If Buddha<br />was Vishnu's avatar he would not have commented like that.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The ISKCON translation of Srmad Bhagavadam mentions a sloka 'Buddha born inGaya to redeem mankind'. I am not a sanskrit expert to verify this and also not a huge fan of ISKON either. <br />?<br />There was also an article in times of india which I saved a long time ago, as below. <br />?<br />Malathi<br />?<br />The Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu<br />Author: A Seshan <br />Publication: The Times of India <br />Date: May 7, 2001 <br />THE story of Gautama, the Buddha (the enlightened one), is well known. He expounded the four noble truths (Arya Satya) concerning suffering, its cause, its destruction and the way to the elimination of sorrow. He was against the extremes of both self-indulgence and self-mortification. A Middle Path was advocated consisting of right views, right aspirations, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right contemplation. He rejected the authority of the Vedas, condemned ritualisticpractices, especially animal sacrifice, and denied the existence of gods. Buddhism flourished for more than a millennium and spread to foreign lands also. But a decline set in after the Golden Age of the Guptas (4th to 5th centuries AD). <br />Foreign historians, with limited knowledge of Indian philosophical systems,have attributed the decline of Buddhism in the land of its birth to the advent of Adi Sankara. The 68th Sankaracharya of the Kanchi Kamakoti Math, Shri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, has effectively nailed this canard. According to him, Sankara was more concerned with setting right the errors in Saankhya and Meemaamsa philosophies of Hinduism which denied the importance ofIsvara though basically subscribing to the Vedas. Even where he specifically dealt with Buddhism, he condemned only its denial of the existence of God. Then how did the religion decline? It was because of the vehement opposition to Buddhism on philosophical and religious grounds by Meemaamsakas andTaarkikas (logicians). <br />The point is also that, even as people admired Buddha and turned to his religion, they did not give up their old beliefs and ritualistic practices. Togive a contemporary example, many call themselves Gandhians but in their lives, official or personal, they follow a path just the opposite of what heshowed! King Ashoka (2nd century BC) did much to propagate the religion within India and without. Still in his rock edicts he calls himself as "Devanampiya" or "the beloved of the gods". There were no gods in Buddhism at histime. So obviously he was referring to Hindu gods. In other words, he continued to believe in Hindu religion even as he admired Buddha. Buddhist texts written by bikshus have a Saraswati stotra in the beginning paying obeisance to the Hindu goddess of learning. It is not unusual to see an idol of Lord Ganesh in a Buddhist temple. <br />Adi Sankara accepted the tenets of Buddhism at the level of pure consciousness. The ultimate stage in his philosophy was the giving up of rituals and concentrating the mind on the infinite. Buddha wanted his followers to takea quantum leap at the initial stage itself to this ultimate goal, something which is difficult to expect of ordinary men and women. Sankara advocatedabiding by the karmas, as stipulated by Meemaamsa, to begin with, and proceeding gradually to the stage envisaged by Buddha of giving them up altogether. However, Buddha did believe in two cardinal principles of Hinduism, viz. the transmigration of the soul and the law of karma (that our actions have consequences). Thus fundamentally there is little difference between thetwo religions except that Buddha conceived his as an ethical and secular way of life. <br />Perhaps the most important reason for the decline of Buddhism as a separatereligion was the absorption of its founder in the Hindu pantheon of gods -indeed an irony for one who denied their existence! There are many incarnations of Vishnu of which the Dasavatar or the ten incarnations are the mostwell known. In the Southern tradition they are: matsya (fish), koorma (tortoise), varaha (boar), Narasimha (the man-lion), Vamana (the dwarf) Parasurama (the angry prince), Rama (the perfect human), Balarama, his younger brother Krishna (the divine statesman) and Kalki (the redeemer of righteousness in the kali yuga, who is yet to appear). In the Northern tradition Balarama is replaced by Buddha who appears as the ninth avatar after Krishna, hismission being to purify Hinduism. Srimad Bhagavatam (circa 900 AD, according to Farquhar) takes the stand that Krishna is the original form of Vishnuand the incarnations were all his. In its list of Dasavatar, which<br />many consider as the most authentic, both Baladeva (or Balarama) and Buddha appear. Krishna is not mentioned because he is the original god. The Dasavatara Stotra of Jayadev (12th century), parts of which are included in AdiGuru Granth compiled by Guru Arjun Singh, follows the list of Bhagavatam. In this scheme, Buddhism was like the reformation movement of Martin Lutherin Christianity. Once Buddha himself became an incarnation of Vishnu therewas no need for the religion to exist separately in this country. <br />?</p>

        <p>This has reference to the Sandhya vandhana mantram. Where we receite<br />the accurate time of the sandhya being done. Here we receite it as</p>

<p>All,</p>
<p>Here is my two paise (In the true Indian Sense) worth.</p>
<p>As per Srimadh Bhagavatham composed by Sage Vyasa, the Avatars of </p>
<p>Vishnu are not 10 but 21. It also includes Buddha. But this Buddha is </p>
<p>said to be different one from that of Gauthama Buddha. The legend of </p>
<p>this Buddha is as follows:-</p>
<p>Once, the Asuras started following Vedas and also by virtue of this </p>
<p>they became very powerful and hence defeated the Devas very easily. </p>
<p>As usual(!!) Indra runs to Siva for protection. Siva says, the Asuras </p>
<p>have become powerful, because they have started following the Vedas. </p>
<p>So try to wean them away from the Vedas and it will be easy for you </p>
<p>to defeat them. </p>
<p>Now Indra runs to Vishnu to ask for help. Then Vishnu took the Buddha </p>
<p>Avathar and mispropagated to the Asuras that the Vedas are to be </p>
<p>renounced etc. The Asuras fell for this and it was easy for Indra to </p>
<p>defeat them.</p>
<p>The above is as recorded in Srimadh Bhagavatham. So this Buddha of </p>
<p>Vishnu is definitely different from the Gauthama Buddha. The later </p>
<p>day (but as early as Pallava sculptures) artists could have </p>
<p>misconstrued this to be Gauthama Buddha and hence we see him in the </p>
<p>10 Avatars list.</p>
<p>Regarding Balarama Avatar, it is the most confusing one in the line </p>
<p>up. I will try and post something after I go through Srimadh </p>
<p>Bhagavatham in detail.</p>

        <p>Udanx, whatever little I know, Buddha was included in Avatars to make Buddhism part of Hindusim during the days when conflict between the two religions was very high. I don't understand the Balarama/Lakshmana thing either. <br />?<br />It is impossible to say what is right and wrong in all this since many years have gone by and many interpolations have happened.

<p>Yes that is true as far as my knowledge goes also. Parasurama was in his ageing years during Sri Rama's incarnation. My understanding is that avatar is not 100% divine has very clear human aspects and Parasurama was very muchhuman when he met with Sri Rama and finally attained samadhi. </p>

        <p>Yes that is true as far as my knowledge goes also. Parasurama was in his ageing years during Sri Rama's incarnation. My understanding is that avatar is not 100% divine has very clear human aspects and Parasurama was very muchhuman when he met with Sri Rama and finally attained samadhi. <br />?<br />The ninth and tenth to some extent are controversial. Balarama/Buddha issueis controversial, Balarama being Adisesha was not an avatar, some say Buddha was made into an avatar to imbue buddhism into hinduism also and some say he was truly an incarnation himself.? Kalki is a yet to happen avatar according to some and among more evangelical hindus has assumed the status of 'second coming' of Christ. </p>

<p>I don't think Balarama is considered as an Avatar of Vishnu, Balarama<br />is incarnation of Adisesha. Parasurama is considered as an Avatar of<br />Vishu who was parallel to Lord Rama.</p>

<p>Rahul, if anyone ha an opinion there will be counter opinion. It is wholly<br />unfair to dub counter opinions as kutram kandu...whatever . I must confess<br />also that I have noticed grouping of people - probably members who have<br />known one another as friends and one lines up supporting <br />anoother, one person even took offence and left a while ago. If we connot<br />hav counter opinions this is only a news group not a healthy discussion<br />board and it may very well be so no harm. But to allow only some people to<br />have opinions and others to read is imbalanced. that is all.</p>

<p>   I disagree - this is worse than using "Ponniyin selvan" for <br />   Veerappan. In that case, it would have been just inappropriate, but <br />   here, it is wrong and erodes the historic meaning we attach to <br />  words. </p>
<p>   "avatharam" cannot apply to anybody. Literally, it may <br />   mean "reincarnation", but the term per our religion/mythology has <br />   applied only to divine incarnations, which happen for a exalted <br />   purpose.. for ordinary mortals, it is just punarjanmam :) </p>
<p>   Like many other words, the word "avatar" has been hijacked into <br />   English and used in other contexts.. Airbender, Second Life <br />  avatars.. </p>
<p>   But Kamal should have known better.. Fletcher an avatar? ugh.. </p>
<p>   In addition, he has created confusion in kids - my 5-yr old <br />  daughter <br />   is wondering why she cannot see the movie if its about <br />  Dasavatharam : <br />   (( </p>

<p>     Dear Sampath, </p>
<p>       What will be our stand if a movie on Veerappan's exploits is <br />  named <br />       "Ponniyin Selvan", the hero of 1500 members of this august <br />  group? <br />       Veerappan has also drank Kaveri water. </p>
<p>       Sampath </p>
<p>     Please note that there is atleast a connection to the count when <br />     Kamal titled it Dasavatharam. Also I did not find anything <br />     derogatory in terming it so. On the contrary I feel that your <br />  above <br />     example is a little far fetched. Definitely Veerappan cannot be <br />     termed Ponniyin Selvan and you know this. So there "will" be <br />     heartburns definitely. </p>
<p>     On the contrary, rather than worrying about the title being <br />     Dasavatharam (of course it was not in a derogatory sense), if one <br />   is <br />     interested in the proper representation of the religious symbols, <br />  I <br />     feel that we need to take up the case of the Comedians making fun <br />   of <br />     the "thiruneeru" and "thiruman" and any other such religious <br />     symbols. I see that these are used in a more derogatory sense in <br />     movies than being titled Dasavatharam. </p>
<p>     So my humble opinion is let us not lose the focus on real <br />  problems, <br />     by looking at something that, in reality, is not a problem at <br />  all, <br />     considering the derogatory remarks, </p>

        <p>I am sure Kamal saar would not have it any other way :)))</p>
<p>Anyway about the subject of the thread, Kamal is what one would call <br />a 'new ager' in the western world. New Agers are mostly people who <br />take what is 'good' or what they see as 'good' from various sources <br />and form a philosphy which mostly makes sense to them and somewhat <br />to others. Their atheism is also strongly based on belief that all <br />belief in God is connected to religion (which is itself compltetly <br />false) and the opposite of that is atheism/humanism which only <br />recognizes the 'anbe sivam' model.There are many belivers who are <br />humanists, many athiests who are orthodox in their beliefs, many <br />combinations which they don't like to think or talk about.</p>
<p>I like the guy in some ways, he tries to combine some message in his <br />movies ,which is good perhaps in today's marketing world. I don't <br />like the 'shallow digs' he likes to take at believers which strongly <br />border on new ageism, or rule out the idea that he makes movies for <br />money, same as everyone else.</p>
