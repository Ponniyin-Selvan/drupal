</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS <br />President<br />Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal <br />complications of<br />a bizarre death. Here is the story:</p>
<p>On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald <br />Opus and<br />concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. Mr. Opus had<br />jumped from the top of a 10-story building intending to commit <br />suicide. He<br />left a note to the effect indicating his despondency.</p>
<p>As he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a <br />shotgun blast<br />passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the <br />shooter<br />nor the deceased was aware that a safety net had been installed just <br />below<br />the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that <br />Ronald<br />Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had<br />planned.</p>
<p>Dr. Mills continued, " Ordinarily, a person who sets out to commit <br />suicide<br />and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what <br />he<br />intended, is still defined as committing suicide." That Mr. Opus was <br />shot<br />on the way to death, but probably would not have been successful <br />because of<br />the safety net, caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a <br />homicide<br />on his hands.</p>
<p>The room on the ninth floor, where the shotgun blast emanated, was <br />occupied<br />by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously and he <br />was<br />threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he <br />pulled<br />the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went <br />through the<br />window striking Mr. Opus. When one intends to kill subject "A" but <br />kills<br />subject "B" in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of <br />subject "B".</p>
<p>When confronted with the murder charge the old man and his wife were <br />both<br />adamant and both said that they thought the shotgun was unloaded. <br />The old<br />man said it was a long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the<br />unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her. Therefore, the <br />killing<br />of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, if the gun had been<br />accidentally loaded. The continuing investigation turned up a <br />witness who<br />saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior <br />to the<br />fatal accident.</p>
<p>It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial <br />support and<br />the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun<br />threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father <br />would<br />shoot his mother. Since the loader of the gun was aware of this, he <br />was<br />guilty of the murder even though he didn't actually pull the <br />trigger. The<br />case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death <br />of<br />Ronald Opus.</p>
<p>Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that <br />the son<br />was, in fact, Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent <br />over the<br />failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him <br />to<br />jump off the 10-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a<br />shotgun blast passing through the ninth story window. The son had <br />actually<br />murdered himself so the medical examiner closed the case as a <br />suicide.</p>

<p>28 June, 1914<br />The Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand </p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------<br />Borijove Jevtic, one of the leaders of the Narodna Odbrana who was <br />arrested with Gavrilo Princip immediately after the assassination, <br />gave this firsthand account of the killing.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------</p>
<p>A tiny clipping from a newspaper, mailed without comment from a <br />secret band of terrorists in Zagreb, capital of Croatia, to their <br />comrades in Belgrade, was the torch which set the world afire with <br />war in 1914. That <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of paper wrecked old, proud empires. It gave <br />birth to new, free nations.</acronym></p>
<p>I was one of the members of the terrorist band in Belgrade which <br />received it. </p>
<p>The little clipping declared that the Austrian Archduke Francis <br />Ferdinand would visit Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, June 28, to <br />direct army maneuvers in the neighboring mountains. </p>
<p>It reached our meeting place, the cafe called Zlatna Moruna, one <br />night the latter part of April, 1914. To understand how great a <br />sensation that little piece of paper caused among us when it was <br />passed from hand to hand almost in silence, and how greatly it <br />inflamed our hearts, it is necessary to explain just why the Narodna <br />Odbrana existed, the kind of men that were in it, and the <br />significance of that date, June 28, on which the Archduke dared to <br />enter Sarajevo. </p>
<p>As every one knows, the old Austrio-Hungarian Empire was built by <br />conquest and intrigues, by sales and treacheries, which held [...] <br />men of the upper classes were ardent patriots. They were dissimilar <br />in everything except hatred of the oppressor. </p>
<p>Such were the men into whose hands the tiny <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of newsprint was <br />sent by friends in Bosnia that April night in Belgrade. At a small <br />table in a very humble cafe, beneath a flickering gas jet we sat and <br />read it. There was no advice nor admonition sent with it. Only four <br />letters and two numerals were sufficient to make us unanimous, <br />without discussion, as to what we should do about it.</acronym></p>
<p>They were conived [sic] in Sarajevo all the twenty-two conspirators <br />were in their allotted positions, armed and ready. They were <br />distributed five hundred yards apart over the whole route along <br />which the Archduke must travel from the railroad station to the town <br />hall. </p>
<p>When Francis Ferdinand and his retinue drove from the station they <br />were allowed to pass the first two conspirators. The motor cars were <br />driving too fast to make an attempt feasible and in the crowd were <br />many Serbians; throwing a grenade would have killed many innocent <br />people. </p>
<p>When the car passed Gabrinovic, the compositor, he threw his <br />grenade. It hit the side of the car, but Francis Ferdinand with <br />presence of mind threw himself back and was uninjured. Several <br />officers riding in his attendance were injured. </p>
<p>The cars sped to the Town Hall and the rest of the conspirators did <br />not interfere with them. After the reception in the Town Hall <br />General Potiorek, the Austrian Commander, pleaded with Francis <br />Ferdinand to leave the city, as it was seething with rebellion. The <br />Archduke was persuaded to drive the shortest way out of the city and <br />to go quickly. </p>
<p>The road to the maneuvers was shaped like the letter V, making a <br />sharp turn at the bridge over the River Milgacka. Francis <br />Ferdinand's car could go fast enough until it reached this spot but <br />here it was forced to slow down for the turn. Here Princip had taken <br />his stand. </p>
<p>As the car came abreast he stepped forward from the curb, drew his <br />automatic pistol from his coat and fired two shots. The first struck <br />the wife of the Archduke, the Archduchess Sofia, in the abdomen. She <br />was an expectant mother. She died instantly.</p>
<p>The second bullet struck the Archduke close to the heart. </p>
<p>He uttered only one word, 'Sofia' -- a call to his stricken wife. <br />Then his head fell back and he collapsed. He died almost instantly. </p>
<p>The officers seized Princip. They beat him over the head with the <br />flat of their swords. They knocked him down, they kicked him, <br />scraped the skin from his neck with the edges of their swords, <br />tortured him, all but killed him.</p>
<p>The next day they put chains on Princip's feet, which he wore till <br />his death.... </p>
<p>I was placed in the cell next to Princip's, and when Princip was <br />taken out to walk in the prison yard I was taken along as his <br />companion...</p>
<p>Awakened in the middle of the night and told that he was to be <br />carried off to another prison, Princip made an appeal to the prison <br />governor: </p>
<p>'There is no need to carry me to another prison. My life is already <br />ebbing away. I suggest that you nail me to a cross and burn me <br />alive. My flaming body will be a torch to light my people on their <br />path to freedom.'</p>

        <p>Dear VJ<br />this might be of interest<br /><a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa072097b.htm" title="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa072097b.htm">http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa072097b.htm</a><br />Regards<br />Sri</p>

<p>On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald <br />Opus and<br />concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. Mr. Opus had<br />jumped from the top of a 10-story building intending to commit <br />suicide. He<br />left a note to the effect indicating his despondency.</p>
<p>As he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a <br />shotgun blast<br />passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the <br />shooter<br />nor the deceased was aware that a safety net had been installed just <br />below<br />the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that <br />Ronald<br />Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had<br />planned.</p>
<p>Dr. Mills continued, " Ordinarily, a person who sets out to commit <br />suicide<br />and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what <br />he<br />intended, is still defined as committing suicide." That Mr. Opus was <br />shot<br />on the way to death, but probably would not have been successful <br />because of<br />the safety net, caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a <br />homicide<br />on his hands.</p>
<p>The room on the ninth floor, where the shotgun blast emanated, was <br />occupied<br />by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously and he <br />was<br />threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he <br />pulled<br />the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went <br />through the<br />window striking Mr. Opus. When one intends to kill subject "A" but <br />kills<br />subject "B" in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of <br />subject "B".</p>
<p>When confronted with the murder charge the old man and his wife were <br />both<br />adamant and both said that they thought the shotgun was unloaded. <br />The old<br />man said it was a long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the<br />unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her. Therefore, the <br />killing<br />of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, if the gun had been<br />accidentally loaded. The continuing investigation turned up a <br />witness who<br />saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior <br />to the<br />fatal accident.</p>
<p>It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial <br />support and<br />the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun<br />threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father <br />would<br />shoot his mother. Since the loader of the gun was aware of this, he <br />was<br />guilty of the murder even though he didn't actually pull the <br />trigger. The<br />case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death <br />of<br />Ronald Opus.</p>
<p>Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that <br />the son<br />was, in fact, Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent <br />over the<br />failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him <br />to<br />jump off the 10-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a<br />shotgun blast passing through the ninth story window. The son had <br />actually<br />murdered himself so the medical examiner closed the case as a <br />suicide.</p>

<blockquote><p>  At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS <br />  President<br />  Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal <br />  complications of<br />  a bizarre death. Here is the story:</p>
<p>  On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald <br />  Opus and<br />  concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. Mr. Opus <br />had<br />  jumped from the top of a 10-story building intending to commit <br />  suicide. He<br />  left a note to the effect indicating his despondency.</p>
<p>  As he fell past the ninth floor his life was interrupted by a <br />  shotgun blast<br />  passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the <br />  shooter<br />  nor the deceased was aware that a safety net had been installed <br />just <br />  below<br />  the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that <br />  Ronald<br />  Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he <br />had<br />  planned.</p>
<p>  Dr. Mills continued, " Ordinarily, a person who sets out to commit <br />  suicide<br />  and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be <br />what <br />  he<br />  intended, is still defined as committing suicide." That Mr. Opus <br />was <br />  shot<br />  on the way to death, but probably would not have been successful <br />  because of<br />  the safety net, caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a <br />  homicide<br />  on his hands.</p>
<p>  The room on the ninth floor, where the shotgun blast emanated, was <br />  occupied<br />  by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously and <br />he <br />  was<br />  threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he <br />  pulled<br />  the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went <br />  through the<br />  window striking Mr. Opus. When one intends to kill subject "A" but <br />  kills<br />  subject "B" in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of <br />  subject "B".</p>
<p>  When confronted with the murder charge the old man and his wife <br />were <br />  both<br />  adamant and both said that they thought the shotgun was unloaded. <br />  The old<br />  man said it was a long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the<br />  unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her. Therefore, <br />the <br />  killing<br />  of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, if the gun had <br />been<br />  accidentally loaded. The continuing investigation turned up a <br />  witness who<br />  saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior <br />  to the<br />  fatal accident.</p>
<p>  It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial <br />  support and<br />  the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun<br />  threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father <br />  would<br />  shoot his mother. Since the loader of the gun was aware of this, <br />he <br />  was<br />  guilty of the murder even though he didn't actually pull the <br />  trigger. The<br />  case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the <br />death <br />  of<br />  Ronald Opus.</p>
<p>  Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that <br />  the son<br />  was, in fact, Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent <br />  over the<br />  failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led <br />him <br />  to<br />  jump off the 10-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by <br />a<br />  shotgun blast passing through the ninth story window. The son had <br />  actually<br />  murdered himself so the medical examiner closed the case as a <br />  suicide.</p>
