<p>Gangadevi also known as Gangambika was a poet in the Vijayanagara Empire during the 14th century and chronicled the story of the victory of her husband, Kumara Kampana, son of Bukka Raya I over the Muslims in Madhura in the form of a poem. The title of the eight chapter poem was Madhura Vijayam, also known as Veerakamparaya Charitram.</p>

<p><acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym , in his "A History of South India" under the chapter "The Empire of Vijayanagar" states thus</p>
<p>".........The?Pandya's failre to recover?Madura is the historic justification for Kanpana's campaign against the Madura sultan which history places in the years from 1365 to 1370. The image of Ranganatha, which had been carried away?from Srirangam for safety during the time of the Muslin inroads, was restored to its original place in 1371."</p>
<p>An?Inscription?in Thiruppullani temple also confirms that Kampana defeated the Sultan of Madurai in Salivahana Year 1293, which actually corresponds to 1371 AD. </p>
<p>The inscription on?Srirangam Temple wall, is in sanskrit and starts with "Aa nIyA neela srunga.....". In this too the?Salivahana Era 1293 is mentioned as the year of victory and restoration of Ranganatha to Srirangam.</p>

<p>     Not very far from this entrance you see the VERY FIRST Inscription of Kampana - one Achudha Raya (if my memory is not failing), who was an official of Kampana - recording a grant nearly one hundred and odd years after the last pandiyan inscription. </p>
<p>     This inscription represents the victory and establishment of vijayanagara forces. There is not even a sign board to help you to identify this inscription. </p>
<p>     All structures that you see in front of this entrance - Including the grand garuda mandapa - were built by Nayaks and vijayanagara kings. </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Date: 8-5-2009</p>
<p>Dear R. Venketesh,</p>
<p>Your are correct. The Muslim Historians - Wassaf &amp; Khusru has given<br />first hand information on the "Later Pandiyas". Wassaf has given a more<br />graphic account than Khusru of what happened during the final stages of<br />the last Tamil empire of Tamil Nadu - namely the Pandiyan Empire.</p>
<p>I have given below the extracts from the Historical Writings of these<br />two Historians, on the Muslim Invasions of the Ma'bar region (the Tamil<br />Nadu).</p>
<p>One point that is to be seen in these two extracts is that Wassaf seems<br />to be more well informed of the historical events than Khusru. Based on<br />this reason we could take the statement made by Wassaf that Vira<br />Pandiyan was the younger brother of Sundera Pandiyan. It appears Khusru<br />was not correct in stating that Vira Pandiyan was the eldest while<br />Sundera Pandiya was the youngest.</p>
<p>Wassaf has referred to Kulasekara Pandiyan the father of Sundera<br />Pandiyan &amp; Vira Pandiyan as "Kales Dewar" meaning Kulasekars Dewar. The<br />Vira Pandiya has been erronously referred as Tira Pandiya.</p>
<p>Khusru has referred in his writings the Vira Pandiya erronously as Bir<br />Pandiya.</p>
<p>In these writings "Rai" means "king".</p>
<p>Now I provide below - the relevent extracts taken from the Historical<br />Writings of these two Historians - for the benefit of the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym  Members<br />and others.</acronym></p>
<p>Virarajendra</p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<p>TAZJIYATU-L AMS?R WA TAJRIYATU-L ?S?R<br />OF<br />'ABDU-LLAH, WASS?F.<br />Invasion of Ma'bar.<br />In the month of Rajab of the year 710 H. (1310 A.D.) the ap?pointed<br />leaders, accompanied by a select army, were dispatched to conquer<br />Ma'bar, and some of the towns were obtained through the animosity which<br />has lately arisen between the two brothers; when at last a large army,<br />attended by numerous elephants of war, was sent out to oppose the<br />Muhammadans. Malik Nab?, who thought himself a very Saturn, was<br />obliged to retreat, and bring back his army.<br />Ulj??t? Sult?n sends an Embassy to 'Al?u-d d?n.<br />About that period the king of the world, ?lj??t?*<br />Sult?n,? May his empire last for ever!?sent two ambassadors,<br />named Kh?l?ya and Muhammad Sh?h, to the court of Dehli, with a<br />royal mandate to the following purport, that as the rulers of that<br />quarter, both in the reign of the Emperor Chang?z Kh?n, the<br />conqueror of the world, and the most generous ?kt?? Kh?n, had<br />tendered their friendship and homage, and, through the language of the<br />ambassadors, had occasionally offered their sentiments of goodwill, it<br />is, therefore, strange that, since the imperial throne has been adorned<br />by our auspicious accession, and the sun of the kingdom of Isl?m has<br />shed its light over the world, Sult?n 'Al?u-d d?n has never<br />opened the road of ancient friendship by means of an ambassador to our<br />regal court, nor sent a message conveying tidings of himself or<br />congratulations to us; it is, therefore, expected that he will<br />henceforth be willing to apply him?self to strengthen the foundations<br />of regard and free intercourse. In connection with this embassy it was<br />also intimated that the Emperor asked in marriage one of the Princesses<br />from behind the veil of the kingdom of Dehli.*</p>
<p>Sult?n 'Al?u-d d?n, notwithstanding all his bravery and<br />con?quests, and abundant treasures and obedient armies, combining in<br />himself all personal accomplishments and worldly advantages, was a<br />tyrant, and never used to hesitate at slaughter, burning, restricting<br />the privileges of the army, or reducing the allowances of his servants,<br />and was quite overcome by his disposition to?wards temerity and<br />oppression. As a proof of this he ordered the ambassadors to be<br />imprisoned, and several* of their attendants to be trodden under the<br />feet of elephants, and thus he submerged the jewel of his good fame; for<br />to bring trouble on an ambassador is, under every system of religious<br />faith, altogether opposed to the principles of law, social observance,<br />and common sense. With respect to law, an ambassador receives his<br />credentials without even the suspicion of criminality; with respect to<br />social observance, the oppressor and the oppressed, friend and foe,<br />peace and war, are all equally in need of embassies and communications:<br />with respect to common sense, it is abundantly evident that the killing<br />of one man, or even ten, entails no infirmity or injury on a kingdom.<br />Inasmuch, therefore, as 'Al?u-d d?n, free to do as he chose, was<br />guilty of a deed from which danger might have resulted, and without any<br />cause exhibited his enmity, he must be considered to have acted contrary<br />to what a peaceful policy and sound prudence dictated.<br />Continuation of the history of the Kings of Ma'bar.<br />Kales Dewar, the ruler of Ma'bar, enjoyed a highly prosperous life,<br />extending to forty and odd years, during which time neither any foreign<br />enemy entered his country, nor any severe malady confined him to bed.<br />His coffers were replete with wealth, inas?much that in the treasury<br />of the city of Mard? there were 1,200 crores of gold deposited, every<br />crore being equal to a thousand* laks, and every lak to one hundred<br />thousand d?n?rs. Besides this there was an accumulation of<br />precious stones, such as pearls, rubies, turquoises, and<br />emeralds,?more than is in the power of language to express. (Here<br />follows a long string of reflections upon the instability of worldly<br />wealth and grandeur.)</p>
<p>This fortunate and happy sovereign had two sons, the elder named Sundar<br />Pand?, who was legitimate, his mother being joined to the Dewar by<br />lawful marriage, and the younger named T?ra Pand?, was<br />illegitimate, his mother being one of the mis?tresses who continually<br />attended the king in his banquet of pleasure; for it was customary with<br />the rulers of that country that, when the daily affairs of the<br />administration were over, and the crowds that attended the court had<br />gone to their respective homes, a thousand beautiful courtezans used to<br />attend the king in his pleasure. They used to perform the several duties<br />pre?scribed to each of them; some were appointed as chamberlains,<br />some as interpreters, some as cup-bearers, and day and night both the<br />sexes kept promiscuous intercourse together; and it was usual for the<br />king to invite to his bed that girl upon whom the lot should happen to<br />fall. I have mentioned this in illustration of their customs.</p>
<p>As T?ra Pand? was remarkable for his shrewdness and<br />intre?pidity, the ruler nominated him as his successor. His brother<br />Sundar Pand?, being enraged at this supercession, killed his father,<br />in a moment of rashness and undutifulness, towards the close of the year<br />709 H. (1310 A.D.), and placed the crown on his head in the city of<br />M?rd?.* He induced the troops who were there to support his<br />interests, and conveyed some of the roval treasures which were deposited<br />there to the city of Mank?l,* and he him?self accompanied,<br />marching on, attended in royal pomp, with the elephants, horses, and<br />treasures. Upon this his brother T?ra Pand?, being resolved on<br />avenging his father's blood, followed to give him battle, and on the<br />margin of a lake which, in their language, they call Tal?ch?, the<br />opponents came to action. Both the brothers, each ignorant of the fate<br />of the other, fled away; but T?ra Pand? being unfortunate (t?ra<br />bakht), and having been wounded, fell into the hands of the enemy, and<br />seven elephant-loads of gold also fell to the lot of the army of Sundar<br />Pand?.</p>
<p>It is a saying of philosophers, that ingratitude will, sooner or later,<br />meet its punishment, and this was proved in the sequel, for Man?r<br />Barm?l, the son of the daughter of Kales Dewar, who espoused the<br />cause of T?ra Pand?, being at that time at Kar?m-hatt?, near<br />K?l?l,* sent him assistance, both in men and money, which was<br />attended with a most fortunate result. Sundar Pand? had taken<br />possession of the kingdom, and the army and the treasure were his own; but, as in every religion and faith, evil deeds produce a life of<br />insecurity, a matter which it is unneces?sary to expatiate upon, he,<br />notwithstanding all his treasures and the goodwill of the army, was far<br />from being happy and prosperous, entertaining crude notions, and never<br />awaking from his dream of pride, and at last he met with the<br />chastisement due to his ingratitude, for in the middle of the year 710<br />(1310 A.D.) T?ra Pand?, having collected an army, advanced to<br />oppose him, and Sundar Pand?, trembling and alarmed, fled from his<br />native country, and took refuge under the protection of 'Al?u-d<br />d?n, of Dehli, and T?ra Pand? became firmly established in his<br />hereditary kingdom.</p>
<p>While I was engaged in writing this passage, one of my friends said to<br />me: "The kings of Hind are celebrated for their pene?tration and<br />wisdom; why then did Kales Dewar, during his life?time, nominate his<br />younger and illegitimate son as his successor; to the rejection of the<br />elder, who was of pure blood, by which he introduced distraction into a<br />kingdom which had been adorned like a bride."</p>
<p>T?R?KH-I 'AL??.<br />OR<br />KHAZ??NU-L FUT?H,<br />OF<br />AM?R KHUSR?.<br />The Conquest of Ma'bar.<br />"The tongue of the sword of the Khal?fa of the time, which is the<br />tongue of the flame of Isl?m, has imparted light to the entire<br />dark?ness of Hind?st?n by the illumination of its guidance; and<br />on one side an iron wall of royal swords has been raised before the<br />infidel Magog-like T?t?rs, so that all that God-deserted tribe<br />drew their feet within their skirts amongst the hills of Ghazn?, and<br />even their advance-arrows had not strength enough to reach into Sind. On<br />the other side so much dust arose from the battered temple of Somn?t<br />that even the sea was not able to lay it, and on the right hand and on<br />the left hand the army has conquered from sea to sea, and several<br />capitals of the gods of the Hind?s, in which Satanism has prevailed<br />since the time of the Jinns, have been demolished. All these impurities<br />of infidelity have been cleansed by the Sult?n's destruction of<br />idol-temples, beginning with his first holy expedition against<br />Deog?r, so that the flames of the light of the law illumine all these<br />unholy countries, and places for the criers to prayer are exalted on<br />high, and prayers are read in mosques. God be praised!"</p>
<p>"But the country of Ma'bar, which is so distant from the city of<br />Dehli that a man travelling with all expedition could only reach it<br />after a journey of twelve months, there the arrow of any holy warrior<br />had not yet reached; but this world-conquering king determined to carry<br />his army to that distant country, and spread the light of the Muhammadan<br />religion there." Malik N?ib B?rbak was appointed to command<br />the army for this ex?pedition, and a royal canopy was sent with him.<br />The Malik represented that on the coast of Ma'bar were five hundred<br />elephants, larger than those which had been presented to the Sult?n<br />from Arangal, and that when he was engaged in the conquest of that place<br />he had thought of possessing himself of them, and that now, as the wise<br />determination of the king had combined the extirpation of idolaters with<br />this object, he was more than ever rejoiced to enter on this grand<br />enterprise.</p>
<p>The army left Dehli on the 24th of Jum?da-l ?khir, A.H. 710 (Nov.<br />1310 A.D.) and after marching by the bank of the J?n (Jumna) halted<br />at Tankal for fourteen days. While on the bank of the river at that<br />place, the D?w?n of the 'A'riz-i Mam?lik took a muster of the<br />army. "Twenty and one days the royal soldiers, like swift<br />grey-hounds, made lengthened marches, while they were making the road<br />short, until they arrived at Kanh?n; from that, in seventeen more<br />days, they arrived at Gur-g?nw. During these seventeen days the<br />Gh?ts were passed, and great heights and depths were seen amongst the<br />hills, where even the elephants became nearly invisible." "And<br />three large rivers had to be crossed, which occasioned the greatest<br />fears in their passage. Two of them were equal to one another, but<br />neither of them equalled the Nerbadda."</p>
<p>"After crossing those rivers, hills, and many depths, the R?? of<br />Tilang sent twenty-three powerful elephants for the royal service."<br />"For the space of twenty days the victorious army remained at that<br />place, for the purpose of sending on the ele?phants, and they took a<br />muster of the men present and absent, until the whole number was<br />counted. And, according to the command of the king, they suspended<br />swords from the standard poles, in order that the inhabitants of Ma'bar<br />might be aware that the day of resurrection had arrived amongst them; and that all the burnt* Hind?s would be despatched by the sword to<br />their brothers in hell, so that fire, the improper object of their<br />wor?ship, might mete out proper punishment to them."</p>
<p>"The sea-resembling army moved swiftly, like a hurricane, to<br />Ghurg?nw.* Everywhere the accursed tree, that produced no<br />reli?gion, was found and torn up by the roots, and the people who<br />were destroyed were like trunks carried along in the torrent of the<br />J?h?n, or like straw tossed up and down in a whirlwind, and<br />carried forward. When they reached the T?w? (T?pt?), they<br />saw a river like the sea. The army crossed it by a ford quicker than the<br />hurricane they resembled, and afterwards employed itself in cutting down<br />jungles and destroying gardens."</p>
<p>"On Thursday, the 13th of Ramaz?n, the royal canopy cast its<br />shadow on Deog?r, which under the aid of heaven had been protected by<br />the angels, and there the army determined to make all preparations for<br />extirpating Bill?l Deo and other Deos (demons). The R??<br />R?y?n, R?m Deo, who had heard safety to Satan pro?claimed by<br />the dreadful Muhammadan tymbals, considered him?self safe under the<br />protection secured to him; and, true to his allegiance, forwarded with<br />all his heart the preparations necessary for the equipment of the army<br />sent by the Court, so as to render it available for the extermination of<br />rebels and the destruction of the B?r and Dh?r Samundar."* The<br />city was adorned in honour of the occasion, and food and clothes<br />plentifully supplied to the Musulm?ns.</p>
<p>Dalw?, a Hind?, who had been sent on to hold the gates of access<br />to the B?r and Dh?r Samundar, was directed by the R??<br />R?y?n to attend on the Musulm?n camp, and "he was anxious<br />to see the conquest of the whole of Dh?r Samundar by the fortunate<br />devotees of the Ka'ba of religion." The Muhammadan army remained for<br />three days, and on the 17th departed "from the ?man?b?d<br />Deog?r to the Khar?b?b?d of Paras Deo Dalv?,* in five<br />stages, in which three large rivers were crossed," S?n?,<br />God?var?, and B?nh?r,* and other frightful rivers; and<br />"after five days arrived at B?ndr?, in the country (ikta') of<br />Paras Deo Dalv?, who was obedient to his exalted Majesty, and desired<br />that, by the force of the arms of the victorious Mu?hammadan<br />soldiers, B?r Dh?l and B?r P?ndy?* might be re?duced,<br />together with the seas which encircle them, into one cup."*</p>
<p>Here he stayed to make inquiries respecting the countries in advance,<br />when he was informed that the two R??s of Ma'bar, the eldest named<br />B?r P?ndy?, the youngest Sundar P?ndy?,* who had up to<br />that time continued on friendly terms, had advanced against each other<br />with hostile intentions, and that Bill?l Deo, the R?? of Dh?r<br />Samundar, on learning this fact, had marched for the purpose of sacking<br />their two empty cities, and plundering the merchants; but that, on<br />hearing of the advance of the Mu?hammadan army, he had returned to<br />his own country.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 23rd, after holding a council of his chief officers, he<br />took a select body of cavalry with him, and pressed on against Bill?l<br />Deo, and on the 5th of Shaww?l reached the fort of Dh?r Samund,*<br />after a difficult march of twelve days over the hills and valleys, and<br />through thorny forests.</p>
<p>"The fire-worshipping" R??, when he learnt that "his idol<br />temple was likely to be converted into a mosque," despatched<br />K?s? Mal to ascertain the strength and circumstances of the<br />Musulm?ns, and he returned with such alarming accounts that the<br />R?? next morning despatched B?lak Deo N??k to the royal canopy,<br />to represent that "your slave Bill?l Deo is ready to swear<br />allegiance to the mighty emperor, like Laddar Deo and R?m Deo, and<br />whatever the Sulaim?n of the time may order, I am ready to obey. If<br />you desire horses like demons, and elephants like afr?ts, and<br />valuables like those of Deog?r, they are all present. If you wish to<br />destroy the four walls of this fort, they are, as they stand, no<br />obstacle to your advance. The fort is the fort of the king; take<br />it." The commander replied that he was sent with the object of<br />con-verting him to Muhammadanism, or of making him a Zimm?, and<br />subject to pay tax, or of slaying him, if neither of these terms were<br />assented to. When the R?? received this reply, he said he was ready<br />to give up all he possessed, except his sacred thread.</p>
<p>On Friday, the 6th of Shaww?l, the R?? sent B?lak Deo N??k,<br />N?r?in Deo, and J?t Mal, with some other bas?ths, to bow<br />before the royal canopy, and they were accompanied by six elephants.<br />Next day some horses followed. On Sunday, "Bill?l Deo, the<br />sun-worshipper, seeing the splendour of the sword of Isl?m over his<br />head, bowing down his head, descended from his fortress, and came before<br />the shadow of the shadow of God; and, trembling and heartless,<br />prostrated himself on the earth, and rubbed the forehead of subjection<br />on the ground." He then returned to fetch his treasures, and was<br />engaged all night in taking them out, and next day brought them before<br />the royal canopy, and made them over to the king's treasurer.</p>
<p>The commander remained twelve days in that city, "which is four<br />month's distance from Dehli," and sent the captured elephants and<br />horses to that capital.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 18th of Shaww?l, the Malik "beat his drums, and<br />loaded his camels for his expedition to Ma'bar, and after five days<br />arrived at the mountains which divide Ma'bar from Dh?r Samundar. In<br />this range there are two passes?one Sarmal?, and the other<br />T?bar. After traversing the passes, they arrived at night on the<br />banks of the river K?nobar?, and bivouacked on the sands. Thence<br />they departed for B?rdh?l, and committed massacre and devastation<br />all around it. The R?? B?r showed an intent of flying for security<br />to his islands in the ocean, but as he was not able to attempt this, his<br />attendants counselled him to fly by land. With a small amount of<br />treasure and property, he deserted the city, and fled to Kand?r, and<br />even there he dare not remain, but again fled to the jungles.</p>
<p>Thither the Malik pursued "the yellow-faced B?r,"* and at<br />Kand?r was joined by some Musulm?ns who had been subjects of the<br />Hind?s, now no longer able to offer them protection. They were half<br />Hind?s, and not strict in their religious obser?vances, but<br />"as they could repeat the kalima, the Malik of Isl?m spared their<br />lives. Though they were worthy of death, yet, as they were Musulm?ns,<br />they were pardoned."</p>
<p>After returning to B?rdh?l, he again pursued the R?j? to<br />Kand?r, and took one hundred and eight elephants, one of which was<br />laden with jewels. The R?? again escaped him, and he ordered a<br />general massacre at Kand?r. It was then ascertained that he had fled<br />to J?lkota, "an old city of the ancestors of B?r." There<br />the Malik closely pursued him, but he had again escaped to the jungles,<br />which the Malik found himself unable to penetrate, and he therefore<br />returned to Kand?r, where he searched for more elephants. Here he<br />heard that in Brahmastp?r? there was a golden idol, round which<br />many elephants were stabled. The Malik started on a night expedition<br />against this place, and in the morning seized no less than two hundred<br />and fifty ele?phants. He then determined on razing the beautiful<br />temple to the ground,?"you might say that it was the Paradise of<br />Shad-d?d, which, after being lost, those hellites had found, and that<br />it was the golden Lanka of R?m,"?"the roof was covered with<br />rubies and emeralds,"?"in short, it was the holy place of the<br />Hind?s, which the Malik dug up from its foundations with the greatest<br />care," "and the heads of the Brahmans and idolaters danced from<br />their necks and fell to the ground at their feet," and blood flowed<br />in torrents. "The stone idols called Ling Mah?deo, which had been<br />a long time established at that place,?quibus, mulieres infidelium<br />pudenda sua affricant,* ?these, up to this time, the kick of the<br />horse of Isl?m had not attempted to break." The Musulm?ns<br />destroyed all the lings, "and Deo Narain fell down, and the other<br />gods who had fixed their seats there raised their feet, and jumped so<br />high, that at one leap they reached the fort of Lanka, and in that<br />affright the lings themselves would have fled had they had any legs to<br />stand on." Much gold and valuable jewels fell into the hands of the<br />Musulm?ns, who re?turned to the royal canopy, after executing<br />their holy project, on the 13th of Z?-l ka'da, 710 H. (April, 1311<br />A.D.). They destroyed all the temples at B?rdh?l, and placed the<br />plunder in the public treasury.<br />Capture of Southern Mathra (Madura).<br />After five days, the royal canopy moved from B?rdh?l on Thursday,<br />the 17th of Z?-l ka'da, and arrived at Kham, and five days afterwards<br />they arrived at the city Mathra (Madura), the dwelling-place of the<br />brother of the R?? Sundar P?ndy?. They found the city empty,<br />for the R?? had fled with the R?n?s, but had left two or three<br />elephants in the temple of Jagn?r (Jag-gan?th)." The<br />elephants were captured and the temple burnt.</p>
<p>When the Malik came to take a muster of his captured ele?phants they<br />extended over a length of three parasangs, and amounted to five hundred<br />and twelve, besides five thousand horses, Arabian and Syrian, and five<br />hundred mans of jewels of every description?diamonds, pearls,<br />emeralds, and rubies.<br />Return to Dehli.<br />On Sunday, the 4th of Z?-l hijja, 710 H. Malik K?f?r,<br />accom?panied by his army, returned towards Dehli with all the<br />plunder, and arrived in safety on Monday, the 4th of Jum?da-s<br />S?n?, 711 H. Sult?n 'Al?u-d d?n held a public darb?r<br />in front of the Golden Palace, and all the nobles and chiefs stood on<br />the right and on the left, according to their rank. Malik N?ib<br />K?f?r Haz?r-d?n?r?, with the officers who had<br />accompanied him, were presented to the Sult?n, before whom the rich<br />booty was ex?hibited. The Sult?n was much gratified, loaded the<br />warriors with honour, and the darb?r was dissolved.</p>

        <p>HI,<br />?<br />I am starting off on reading "Alberuni's India" by Edward Sachau. Alberuni's Indica is the first person version of?critical analysis of the Indian civilization at 1015AD, from a Muslim point of view. Point to note, Alberunihimself hated the arabs and turks. Can anyone let me know if there are books about Ibn Batuta's travel, would be a relevant reading for understandingthe kind of destruction that south india faced.<br />?<br />Will be checking up the gutenburg project/a million books.com too for such translated books.<br />Regards</p>

<blockquote><p>  Malik kafurs was a short but brutal invasion which happened several yearsearlier. But Ulugh khan stayed in srirangam with his forces and plundered.I think this time the damage was permanent.</p></blockquote>
<p>malik kafur represented the khiljis. ulugh khan the thuklaks. there was a dynasty change in delhi in between i guess.</p>
<p>but maliks loot was fully spent on defence against the mongols against whomthe delhi rulers always had a fear.<br />allaudin was the first ruler to efetively stop the mongols. he built a palace on the buried heads of a few thousand mongol prisoners. at siri.</p>
<p>the mongols were later defeated in egypt. perhaps the two cases where theirinflux was stopped.</p>
<p>At its greatest extent mongol empire stretched from the Danube to the Sea of Japan and from Arctic to kampuchea, covering over 33,000,000 km2 (12,741,000 sq mi), 22% of the Earth's total land area, and held sway over a population of over 100 million people but not india. thats one attribute we haveto give allaudin khilji.</p>

<blockquote><p>  -last invasion of srirangam was in 1323 by Ulugh Khan. <br />  possibly parakrama pandyan was in power then.</p></blockquote>
<p>Malik kafurs was a short but brutal invasion which happened several years earlier. But Ulugh khan stayed in srirangam with his forces and plundered. Ithink this time the damage was permanent.</p>
<blockquote><p> 14th century CE. It lasted from 1333 until 1378.whether their power  lasted upto srirangam is a doubt.</p></blockquote>
<p>After veera ballala there was no leadership in this region. Inscriptions insrirangam stop well before the islamic invasion and continue only after vijayanagara period</p>
<blockquote><p>  madura vijayam of kampanna happened in 1378.<br />  so tamilnadu in general and madurai in particular were under a sort <br />  of anarchy for 55 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>The damage to madurai temple was much more brutal. A recent archaeology study indicates the garbagraha itself is relatively new (post vijayanagar period - possibly thirumalai nayak period) whereas the gopurams are older (pandiya) ! </p>
<p>which means the sanctum sanctorum itself was disturbed heavily. In this sense srirangam is better as it still has the old garba graha. MADURAI KONDA KOPPARAKESARI inscription is found in the core structure of srirangam (SRBlater chola temples)</p>

<p>Wikipedia states :</p>
<p>Gangadevi also known as Gangambika was a poet in the Vijayanagara Empire during the 14th century and chronicled the story of the victory of her husband, Kumara Kampana, son of Bukka Raya I over the Muslims in Madhura in the form of a poem. The title of the eight chapter poem was Madhura Vijayam, also known as Veerakamparaya Charitram.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Venketesh?Sir,</p>
<p>I would definitely?vote for the TU part as?you said. Well if just thosecompulsions could have been avoided,?the Madhura Vijayam also would havemade a great impact. Honestly the portion in which?Vallabhan and Thatthan really?retrieve the Arangan?Vigraham, first by swinging on the slippery rock and then?finally finding in the forest,?brought me to the edge of the seat. The narration was excellent. And?more importantly Sri Venugopalan did a good?job in?narrating the Preparation of the Vijayanagar army right from the start to capturing the Sambuvarayars and then marching toSrirangam and Madurai.</p>
<p>In fact the compulsions were more depressing than the TU part.<br />?<br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br />PS: For those who may feel a little confused, SriVenugopalan originally wrote this in only two parts. The first part was named "Thiruvarangan Ula" andthe second part was named "Madhura Vijayam". But in the recent editions, he split the first part (Thiruvarangan Ula) in two, naming them as Part 1 and Part 2 and split the original 2nd part (Madhura Vijayam) into two naming them as Part 3 and Part 4. Only he knows why he did so.</p>
