<p>*No. 28.- On the north and west walls of the shrine in the<br />Rajagopala-Perumal Temple*</p>
<p>This inscription is dated in the 29th year of Rajakesarivarman, *alias<br />*Rajadhirajadeva,<br />surnamed Jayankonda-Chola (1.<br />7).[9]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn9 <br />It opens with a panegyrical account of the king?s deeds. The text of this<br />passage has been settled by comparison with the corresponding introductions<br />of three other inscriptions, *viz.,*</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn9></p>
<p>1. Tk.- an inscription of the 29th year in the Svetaranyesvara temple at<br />Tiruvenkadu in the Tanjore district (No. 114 of 1896).</p>
<p>2. Tr. = an inscription of the 31st year in the Adhipurisvara temple at<br />Tiruvorriyur near Madras (No. 107 of 1892).</p>
<p>3. Tai. = an inscription of the 32nd year in the Panchanadesvara temple at<br />Tiruvaiyaru near Tanjore (No. 221 of 1894)</p>
<p>Among the achievements of Rajadhiraja the subjoined inscription mentions<br />that the ?destroyed the palace of the Chalukya king in the city of Kampili?<br />(1. 6). As I have said<br />before,[10]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn10 this<br />statement enables us to identify Rajadhiraja with the king who,<br />according to the *Kalingattu-Parani* (viii. 26), ?planted a pillar of<br />victory at Kampili,? and to place his reign immediately after that of<br />Rajendra-Chola I. and before that of Parakesarivarman, *alias* Rajendradeva.<br />Rajendra-Chola I. ascended the throne in A.D. 1001-2 and reigned until at<br />least A.D. 1032.[11]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn11 <br />An inscription at Mindigal proves that Rajadhiraja?s anointment to the<br />throne took place in A.D.<br />1018.[12]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn12 <br />This would be about the 17th year of the reign of his predecessor<br />Rajendra-Chola I. Consequently, Rajadhiraja appears to have been the<br />co-regent of the latter and cannot have exercised independent royal<br />functions before the death of the other. It is in perfect accordance with<br />this conclusion that his inscriptions which have been discovered so far are<br />all dated in the later years of his reign, *viz.,* between the 26th<br />and 32ndyears.</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn12></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn11></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn10></p>
<p>The introduction of the subjoined inscription states that Rajadhiraja<br />appointed seven of his relatives to be governors over the Chera, Chalukya,<br />Pandya and Ganga countries, the island of Ceylon, the Pallava country, and<br />Kanyakubja (1. 1). This statement is evidently exaggerated, at least as far<br />as it refers to the Chalukya dominions and<br />Kanyakubja.[13]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn13 <br />Next are mentioned three Pandya kings (1. 1f.). The first of them,<br />Manabharana, was decapitated ; the second, Vira-Kerala, was trampled down by<br />an elephant ; and the third, Sudnara-Pandya, was expelled to<br />Mullaiyur. Further,<br />Rajadhiraja killed an unnamed king of Venadu, *i.e.,* Travancore, and three<br />princes of Iramagudam (?). Having routed the Chera king, he followed the<br />example of his ancestor Rajaraja I. in destroying the ships at<br />Kandalur-Salai[14]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn14 (1.<br />2f.)</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn14></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn13></p>
<p>Then followed a victorious war against Ahavamalla, Vikki, Vijayaditya and<br />Sangamayan, which was led by a general named Kevudan, and in the course of<br />which two of Ahavamallas?s officers, named Gandappayan and Gangadhara, were<br />killed and the city of<br />Kollippakkai[15]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn15 was<br />set on fire (1. 3 f.).<br />Kollippakkai or, in Kanarese, Kollipake was included in the territory of the<br />Western Chalukyas,[16]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn16 and<br />Ahavamalla, Vikki and Vijayaditya are identical with the Western<br />Chalukya king Ahavamalla-Somesvara I. (A.D. 1044 and 1068) and two of his<br />sons, Vikramaditya VI. (A.D. 1055 ? 56 and 1076 to 1126) and<br />Vishnuvardhana-Vijayaditya (A.D. 1064 to<br />1074).[17]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn17 </p>
<p>The next of Rajadhiraja?s expeditions cost their crowns to four kings of<br />Ceylon, *viz.,* Vikramabahu, Vikrama-Pandya, Vira-Salamegan, and Srivallabha<br />Madanaraja (1. 4 f.). The second of these is said to have ruled over the<br />southern Tamil country before taking possession of Ceylon, the third to have<br />originally ruled over Kanyakubja, and the fourth to have taken refuge with a<br />certain Krishna. Worst of all fared Vira-Salamegan. The Chola king seized<br />his elder sister and his daughter (or<br />wife)[18]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn18 and<br />cut off the nose of his mother, and the Ceylon king himself fell in<br />battle. An independent and somewhat different account of these struggles is<br />given in the 56th chapter of the<br />*Mahavamsa[19]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn19 <br />* which mentions successively the reigns of Vikramabahu, who is supposed to<br />have reigned from A.D. 1037 to 1049, Vikrama-Pandu (A.D. 1052 to 1053),<br />Jagatipala (A.D. 1053 to 1057), and Parakrama-Pandu (A.D. 1057 to 1059). Of<br />Jagatipala it is said that he came from the city of Ayodhya, that the Cholas<br />slew him in battle, and that they carried his queen and his daughter to the<br />Chola country. As the two first names Vikramabahu and Vikrama-Pandya, are<br />the same in Rajadhiraja?s inscriptions and in the *Mahavamsa*, we may<br />identify Jagatipala with Vira-Salamegan, who came from Kanyakubja, who was<br />killed by the Cholas, and whose elder sister and daughter were carried away<br />by them. It remains uncertain water whether he was a native of Kanyakubja<br />(Kanauj) or Ayodhya, as stated respectively in Rajadhiraja?s inscriptions<br />and in the *Mahavamsa*. The fourth king,<br />Srivallabha[20]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn20 Madanaraja,<br />is perhaps the same as the Parakrama-Pandu of the<br />*Mahavamsa*, who is said to have been killed by the Cholas.</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn20></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn19></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn18></p>
<p>On a second raid to the north Rajadhiraja defeated four chiefs, whose names<br />are given but whom I cannot identify, and destroyed the palace of the<br />Chalukya king at Kampili (1. 5 f.), a place in the Hosapete taluka of the<br />Bellary district, which is also mentioned in a Western Chalukya inscription.<br />[21]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn21 </p>
<p>As I have stated before (p. 39 above), Rajadhiraja was the elder brother of<br />his successor Parakesarivarman, *alias* Rajendradeva, and met with his death<br />in the battle of Koppam. Hence I suspect that it is Rajadhiraja who is<br />meant in a Western Chalukya inscription of A.D. 1071 at Annigere in the<br />Dharwar district, which states that ?the wicked Chola, who had abandoned the<br />religious observances of his family, penetrated into the Belvola country and<br />burned the Jaina temples which Ganga-Permadi, the lord of the Ganga-mandala,<br />while governing the Belvola province, had built in the Annigere-nadu,? and<br />that ?the Chola eventually yielded his head to Somesvara I. in battle, and<br />thus, losing his life, broke the succession of his<br />family.?[22]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn22 <br />?The record adds that the temples were subsequently restored by the *Mandalike<br />*Lakshmadeva.?[23]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn23 </p>
<p>According to Professor Kielhorn?s<br />calculation,[24]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn24 the<br />date of this inscription (1. 7 f.) corresponds to Wednesday, the 3<br />rd December A.D. 1046. On this day the villagers made over to the temple<br />2,200* kuli* of land and received in exchange 100 *kasu* from the temple<br />treasury.</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn24></p>
<p>(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While the goddess of the earth was beaming<br />under his fringed white parasol, which resembled the moon in beauty, (*the<br />king*) wedded the goddess of fortune, wielded the scepter, and destroyed the<br />dark Kali (*age*).</p>
<p>(He) bestowed crowns of brilliant jewels, adorned with gold, on his father?s<br />younger brother, (*his*) glorious elder brother, his distinguished younger<br />brothers,[25]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn25 and<br />his royal sons who knew the (<br />*right*) path, (*along with the titles*)<br />?Vanavan[26]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn26 of<br />great beauty,? ?Vallavan,?<br />[27]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn27 ?Minavan,?<br />[28]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn28 ?Gangan,?<br />?the king of the people of Lanka,? ?Pallavan (<br />*who wears*) golden ankle-rings,? (*and*) ?the protector of the people of<br />Kannakuchchi (*Kanyakubja*),? and granted to these (*relatives*) of great<br />renown the dominions of those (*hostile<br />kings*).[29]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn29 </p>
<p>Among the three allied kings of the South (*i.e.,* Pandyas), - (*he*) cut<br />off on a battle-field the beautiful head of Manabharanan, (*which was<br />adorned with*) large jewels (*and*) which was inseparable from the golden<br />crown ;[30]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn30 seized<br />in a battle Vira-Keralan whose ankle-rings were wide,<br />[31]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn31 and<br />was pleased to get him trampled down by his furious elephant<br />*Attivarana* ;[32]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn32 and<br />drove to the ancient Mullaiyur Sundara-Pandiyan of endless great fame,<br />who lost in a hot battle the royal white parasol, the bunches (*of hairs*)<br />of the white yak and the throne, and who ran away, - his crown dropping<br />down, (*his*) hair being disheveled, and (*his*) feet getting tired.</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn32></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn31></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn30></p>
<p>(L. 2.) (*He*) sent the undaunted king of Venadu to the country of heaven<br />and destroyed in anger the three (*princess*) of the famous Iramgudam.</p>
<p>While the strong Villavan (*i.e.,* Chera) was attacked by pains in the<br />bowels, fled from his country and hid himself in the jungle, (the Chola<br />king) destroyed (*his*) ships (*at*) Kandalur-Salai on the never decreasing<br />ocean as (*easily as he*) would have put on a beautiful fresh flower of the<br />*vanji* (*tree*).</p>
<p>(L. 3.) When even Ahavamallan became afraid ; when Gandappayan and<br />Gangadharan, (*who belonged*) to his army, fell along with (*their*)<br />elephants (*whose temples*) swarmed with bees, (*in a* *battle*) with the<br />irresistible army of Kevudan ; (*and*) when the (*two*) warriors of great<br />courage ?

          What can we learn from inscriptions - Rajadhiraja        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p><a href="http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html" title="http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html">http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume...</a></p>
<p>*No. 28.- On the north and west walls of the shrine in the<br />Rajagopala-Perumal Temple*</p>
<p>This inscription is dated in the 29th year of Rajakesarivarman, *alias<br />*Rajadhirajadeva,<br />surnamed Jayankonda-Chola (1.<br />7).[9]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn9 <br />It opens with a panegyrical account of the king?s deeds. The text of this<br />passage has been settled by comparison with the corresponding introductions<br />of three other inscriptions, *viz.,*</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn9></p>
<p>1. Tk.- an inscription of the 29th year in the Svetaranyesvara temple at<br />Tiruvenkadu in the Tanjore district (No. 114 of 1896).</p>
<p>2. Tr. = an inscription of the 31st year in the Adhipurisvara temple at<br />Tiruvorriyur near Madras (No. 107 of 1892).</p>
<p>3. Tai. = an inscription of the 32nd year in the Panchanadesvara temple at<br />Tiruvaiyaru near Tanjore (No. 221 of 1894)</p>
<p>Among the achievements of Rajadhiraja the subjoined inscription mentions<br />that the ?destroyed the palace of the Chalukya king in the city of Kampili?<br />(1. 6). As I have said<br />before,[10]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn10 this<br />statement enables us to identify Rajadhiraja with the king who,<br />according to the *Kalingattu-Parani* (viii. 26), ?planted a pillar of<br />victory at Kampili,? and to place his reign immediately after that of<br />Rajendra-Chola I. and before that of Parakesarivarman, *alias* Rajendradeva.<br />Rajendra-Chola I. ascended the throne in A.D. 1001-2 and reigned until at<br />least A.D. 1032.[11]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn11 <br />An inscription at Mindigal proves that Rajadhiraja?s anointment to the<br />throne took place in A.D.<br />1018.[12]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn12 <br />This would be about the 17th year of the reign of his predecessor<br />Rajendra-Chola I. Consequently, Rajadhiraja appears to have been the<br />co-regent of the latter and cannot have exercised independent royal<br />functions before the death of the other. It is in perfect accordance with<br />this conclusion that his inscriptions which have been discovered so far are<br />all dated in the later years of his reign, *viz.,* between the 26th<br />and 32ndyears.</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn12></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn11></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn10></p>
<p>The introduction of the subjoined inscription states that Rajadhiraja<br />appointed seven of his relatives to be governors over the Chera, Chalukya,<br />Pandya and Ganga countries, the island of Ceylon, the Pallava country, and<br />Kanyakubja (1. 1). This statement is evidently exaggerated, at least as far<br />as it refers to the Chalukya dominions and<br />Kanyakubja.[13]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn13 <br />Next are mentioned three Pandya kings (1. 1f.). The first of them,<br />Manabharana, was decapitated ; the second, Vira-Kerala, was trampled down by<br />an elephant ; and the third, Sudnara-Pandya, was expelled to<br />Mullaiyur. Further,<br />Rajadhiraja killed an unnamed king of Venadu, *i.e.,* Travancore, and three<br />princes of Iramagudam (?). Having routed the Chera king, he followed the<br />example of his ancestor Rajaraja I. in destroying the ships at<br />Kandalur-Salai[14]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn14 (1.<br />2f.)</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn14></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn13></p>
<p>Then followed a victorious war against Ahavamalla, Vikki, Vijayaditya and<br />Sangamayan, which was led by a general named Kevudan, and in the course of<br />which two of Ahavamallas?s officers, named Gandappayan and Gangadhara, were<br />killed and the city of<br />Kollippakkai[15]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn15 was<br />set on fire (1. 3 f.).<br />Kollippakkai or, in Kanarese, Kollipake was included in the territory of the<br />Western Chalukyas,[16]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn16 and<br />Ahavamalla, Vikki and Vijayaditya are identical with the Western<br />Chalukya king Ahavamalla-Somesvara I. (A.D. 1044 and 1068) and two of his<br />sons, Vikramaditya VI. (A.D. 1055 ? 56 and 1076 to 1126) and<br />Vishnuvardhana-Vijayaditya (A.D. 1064 to<br />1074).[17]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn17 </p>
<p>The next of Rajadhiraja?s expeditions cost their crowns to four kings of<br />Ceylon, *viz.,* Vikramabahu, Vikrama-Pandya, Vira-Salamegan, and Srivallabha<br />Madanaraja (1. 4 f.). The second of these is said to have ruled over the<br />southern Tamil country before taking possession of Ceylon, the third to have<br />originally ruled over Kanyakubja, and the fourth to have taken refuge with a<br />certain Krishna. Worst of all fared Vira-Salamegan. The Chola king seized<br />his elder sister and his daughter (or<br />wife)[18]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn18 and<br />cut off the nose of his mother, and the Ceylon king himself fell in<br />battle. An independent and somewhat different account of these struggles is<br />given in the 56th chapter of the<br />*Mahavamsa[19]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn19 <br />* which mentions successively the reigns of Vikramabahu, who is supposed to<br />have reigned from A.D. 1037 to 1049, Vikrama-Pandu (A.D. 1052 to 1053),<br />Jagatipala (A.D. 1053 to 1057), and Parakrama-Pandu (A.D. 1057 to 1059). Of<br />Jagatipala it is said that he came from the city of Ayodhya, that the Cholas<br />slew him in battle, and that they carried his queen and his daughter to the<br />Chola country. As the two first names Vikramabahu and Vikrama-Pandya, are<br />the same in Rajadhiraja?s inscriptions and in the *Mahavamsa*, we may<br />identify Jagatipala with Vira-Salamegan, who came from Kanyakubja, who was<br />killed by the Cholas, and whose elder sister and daughter were carried away<br />by them. It remains uncertain water whether he was a native of Kanyakubja<br />(Kanauj) or Ayodhya, as stated respectively in Rajadhiraja?s inscriptions<br />and in the *Mahavamsa*. The fourth king,<br />Srivallabha[20]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn20 Madanaraja,<br />is perhaps the same as the Parakrama-Pandu of the<br />*Mahavamsa*, who is said to have been killed by the Cholas.</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn20></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn19></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn18></p>
<p>On a second raid to the north Rajadhiraja defeated four chiefs, whose names<br />are given but whom I cannot identify, and destroyed the palace of the<br />Chalukya king at Kampili (1. 5 f.), a place in the Hosapete taluka of the<br />Bellary district, which is also mentioned in a Western Chalukya inscription.<br />[21]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn21 </p>
<p>As I have stated before (p. 39 above), Rajadhiraja was the elder brother of<br />his successor Parakesarivarman, *alias* Rajendradeva, and met with his death<br />in the battle of Koppam. Hence I suspect that it is Rajadhiraja who is<br />meant in a Western Chalukya inscription of A.D. 1071 at Annigere in the<br />Dharwar district, which states that ?the wicked Chola, who had abandoned the<br />religious observances of his family, penetrated into the Belvola country and<br />burned the Jaina temples which Ganga-Permadi, the lord of the Ganga-mandala,<br />while governing the Belvola province, had built in the Annigere-nadu,? and<br />that ?the Chola eventually yielded his head to Somesvara I. in battle, and<br />thus, losing his life, broke the succession of his<br />family.?[22]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn22 <br />?The record adds that the temples were subsequently restored by the *Mandalike<br />*Lakshmadeva.?[23]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn23 </p>
<p>According to Professor Kielhorn?s<br />calculation,[24]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn24 the<br />date of this inscription (1. 7 f.) corresponds to Wednesday, the 3<br />rd December A.D. 1046. On this day the villagers made over to the temple<br />2,200* kuli* of land and received in exchange 100 *kasu* from the temple<br />treasury.</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn24></p>
<p>(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While the goddess of the earth was beaming<br />under his fringed white parasol, which resembled the moon in beauty, (*the<br />king*) wedded the goddess of fortune, wielded the scepter, and destroyed the<br />dark Kali (*age*).</p>
<p>(He) bestowed crowns of brilliant jewels, adorned with gold, on his father?s<br />younger brother, (*his*) glorious elder brother, his distinguished younger<br />brothers,[25]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn25 and<br />his royal sons who knew the (<br />*right*) path, (*along with the titles*)<br />?Vanavan[26]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn26 of<br />great beauty,? ?Vallavan,?<br />[27]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn27 ?Minavan,?<br />[28]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn28 ?Gangan,?<br />?the king of the people of Lanka,? ?Pallavan (<br />*who wears*) golden ankle-rings,? (*and*) ?the protector of the people of<br />Kannakuchchi (*Kanyakubja*),? and granted to these (*relatives*) of great<br />renown the dominions of those (*hostile<br />kings*).[29]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn29 </p>
<p>Among the three allied kings of the South (*i.e.,* Pandyas), - (*he*) cut<br />off on a battle-field the beautiful head of Manabharanan, (*which was<br />adorned with*) large jewels (*and*) which was inseparable from the golden<br />crown ;[30]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn30 seized<br />in a battle Vira-Keralan whose ankle-rings were wide,<br />[31]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn31 and<br />was pleased to get him trampled down by his furious elephant<br />*Attivarana* ;[32]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn32 and<br />drove to the ancient Mullaiyur Sundara-Pandiyan of endless great fame,<br />who lost in a hot battle the royal white parasol, the bunches (*of hairs*)<br />of the white yak and the throne, and who ran away, - his crown dropping<br />down, (*his*) hair being disheveled, and (*his*) feet getting tired.</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn32></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn31></http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn30></p>
<p>(L. 2.) (*He*) sent the undaunted king of Venadu to the country of heaven<br />and destroyed in anger the three (*princess*) of the famous Iramgudam.</p>
<p>While the strong Villavan (*i.e.,* Chera) was attacked by pains in the<br />bowels, fled from his country and hid himself in the jungle, (the Chola<br />king) destroyed (*his*) ships (*at*) Kandalur-Salai on the never decreasing<br />ocean as (*easily as he*) would have put on a beautiful fresh flower of the<br />*vanji* (*tree*).</p>
<p>(L. 3.) When even Ahavamallan became afraid ; when Gandappayan and<br />Gangadharan, (*who belonged*) to his army, fell along with (*their*)<br />elephants (*whose temples*) swarmed with bees, (*in a* *battle*) with the<br />irresistible army of Kevudan ; (*and*) when the (*two*) warriors of great<br />courage ? Vikki and Vijayadityan, Sangamayan of great strength, and others<br />retreated like cowards, - (*the *Chola* king)* seized (*them*) along with<br />gold of great spleandour and with horses, elephants and steeds, achieved<br />victory in his garment, and caused the centre of Kollippakkai, (*a city*) of<br />the enemies, to be consumed by fire.</p>
<p>(L. 4.) With a single unequalled army (*he*) took the crown of Vikramabahu,<br />the king of the people of Lanka on the tempestuous ocean ; the crown-of<br />large jewels, (*belonging to*) the lord of Lanka, Vikrama-Pandiyan, who,<br />having lost the whole of the southern Tamil country which had previously<br />belonged to him, had entered Ilam (*surrounded by*) the seven oceans ; the<br />beautiful golden crown of the king of Simhala, Vira-Salamegan, who,<br />believing that Ilam (*surrounded by*) ocean was superior to the beautiful<br />Kannakuchchi (*Kanyakubja*) which belonged to him, had entered (*the island*)<br />with his relatives and (*those of*) his countrymen who were willing (*to go<br />with* *him*), and had put on the brilliant crown ; who, having been defeated<br />on the battle-field and having lost his black elephant, had fled<br />ignominiously ; and who, when (the Chola *king)* seized his elder sister<br />along with (*his*)<br />daughter[33]<http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn33 and<br />cut off the nose of (<br />*his*) mother, had returned in order to remove the disgrace (*caused*)<br />thereby, and, having fought hard with the sword, had perished in a hot<br />battle ; and the extremely brilliant crown of large jewels, (*belonging to*)<br />the king of Ilam, Srivallavan (*Srivallabha*)Madanarajan, who had come to<br />Kannaran (*Krishna*) and taken up (*his*) abode (*with him*).</http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn33></p>
