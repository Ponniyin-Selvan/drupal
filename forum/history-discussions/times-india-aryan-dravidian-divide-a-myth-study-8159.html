<p>                  SPS,</p>
<p>                  My Great Grand father's name is 'Ramaswamy'. Grandfather -<br />        Subramaniyam.<br />                  Father - Arunachalam; Me - Satish Kumar - My daugther -<br />        Shambhavi.</p>
<p>                  Five generations - all pure sanskrit names. But Ramaswamy,<br />        Subramaniyam and<br />                  Arunachalam are TODAY considered to be old fashioned names.<br />    Such<br />        names like<br />                  Kuppaiah, Kuppusamy, Ramasamy, Annamalai - which today's<br />        generation might<br />                  ridicule at (surely if any one names their newly born kidas<br />        Ramasamy,<br />                  atleast a few will say why such old fashioned name) were in<br />        vougue just a<br />                  few decades back.</p>
<p>                  In 70's born you can find a lot of Satish - this group has<br />        atleast 4 Satish,<br />                  I think and I am sure there were born in the 70's.</p>
<p>                  80's - the trend was to name the babies with A sounding or sh<br />        sounding<br />                  names. Aashish, Aditya, Amritha, were quite common.</p>
<p>                  Mostly in 70's and 80's the kids were named for fashion and<br />    no<br />        further<br />                  reason. The name should sound modern and apealing.<br />                  90's had a trend of short syllable names - Pyush, poorvi,<br />    Krish -<br />        just a few<br />                  letters, short syllable.</p>
<p>                  2000 - parents do have a lot cultural/spiritual/traditional<br />        inclinations<br />                  and are hunting for traditional but rich sounding and meaning<br />        names.<br />                  Shambhavi, Sibi, Samyuktha, Samravi, Saanvi, Aadeesh, etc.</p>
<p>                  In fact, some people hunt for even pure tamil names. A few<br />    years<br />        back, in a<br />                  marriage of our office colleague, I met one of my colleague<br />    and<br />        her husband<br />                  and son. I was surprised to hear their son's name - 'Kavin'.<br />    They<br />        were in<br />                  the US for more than 7 years and just had returned and their<br />    son<br />        was 4 years<br />                  then. I told them, 'do you know the meaning of Kavin, itsa<br />    100%<br />        pure ultra<br />                  refined Tamil name'. She said, yes, my husband was particular<br />        about a tamil<br />                  name. In my previous company one of my colleague names his<br />    son<br />        'Kavin Mugil'<br />                  - just 6 years ago.</p>
<p>                  And we find that trend pretty much..many of our group members<br />    are<br />        towards<br />                  naming their kids as Poonguzhali, Kundavai etc.</p>
<p>                  Thats the trend now.</p>
<p>                  Just 40 years....and such a huge differences in naming<br />    pattern.<br />        Mainly<br />                  attributed to the communication and knowledge availability of<br />        these decades<br />                  makes these possible. What it took just 40 years would surely<br />        have taken 400<br />                  years in the historic time frame we are talking about.</p>
<p>                  And that perfectly matches your sangam - 600 years later time<br />        frame naming<br />                  conventions. Does it not?</p>
<p>                  Ofcourse, Mix is always there...without that 'Mix' and<br />    change,<br />        the world<br />                  have come to a standstill long back.<br />                  Its definitely not DIVIDE as you said, and you used the right<br />        word 'MIX'.</p>
<p>                  //Brahmi<br />                  Asokar Brahmi<br />                  Tamil Brahmi etc.//</p>
<p>                  Again, - Early Tamil movies - Sivaji movies - had loooooooong<br />        dialogues. Who<br />                  can forget 'Parasakthi' and 'Manohara'. And the herioineshas<br />    to<br />        definitely<br />                  say atleast 'Daddy-mummy'.<br />                  Then the 70's saw 'yathartham' - Barathirajaa kind of stuff.</p>
<p>                  80's saw 'en.......edhukku......en ippadi' in dark without<br />        clarity (in<br />                  visual and dialogue - hope you understand whom I am referring<br />    to<br />        :) ) kind<br />                  of dialogues.</p>
<p>                  90's were more visual than dialogues...</p>
<p>                  2000 - SMS language 'gr8 i hv d tkts fr d mv...lts mt at<br />        t8tr"....</p>
<p>                  THough i was speaking about movies, the script and the<br />    dialogues<br />        were<br />                  written and their form and language varies dramatically.<br />    (today<br />        no writing<br />                  only typing).</p>
<p>                  So in just 40 years so much change in the language we useand<br />    you<br />        are trying<br />                  to derive our history from 1000 year wide gap scripts......<br />                  Is it possible to derive our history through those means is<br />    my<br />        questions? :)</p>

<p>                    Pandya - Sundara Pandian chola : Sundara cholan</p>
<p>                    The similarities in the finds at Adhichanallur (recent<br />    ones)<br />        and<br />                    Harappa (about 100 years back) Sind Province... need tobe<br />        explained.</p>

<p>                    There have been ayes and nos re several factors...</p>
<p>                    We see most of the theories putforth in the past 25 - 30<br />    years<br />        are not<br />                    absolute... and changing... with newer finds /<br />    interpretations.</p>
<p>                    The theory Aryan - Dravidian DIVIDE becomes a myth - when<br />        Adhichanallur and<br />                    Harappa finds are compared... It appears the Word DIVIDE<br />    can be<br />        replaced<br />                    with MIX.</p>
<p>                    We have earlier posted an article in our Gp ... " Muruga "<br />    word<br />        related to<br />                    Muruga existed is even prior to Sangam Origin !<br />                    It is MURUKU having Sanskrit Origin.</p>
<p>                    Again the word DIVIDE can be replaced with MIX.</p>
<p>                    Saivism - from Mt Kailash at Mt Everest getting mixed with<br />        Nature worship /<br />                    Aalamarselvan - ethnic Kotravai Vazhipadu etc.. at Indian<br />        Ocean.</p>
<p>                    Lot of things need to be gone into before putting a concise<br />        postulate ..</p>
<p>                    Subject paper appears to have diluted the DENSITY on the<br />    word<br />        DIVIDE.</p>
<p>                    Let us get to know more.</p>

<p>              In 70's born you can find a lot of Satish - this group has<br />    atleast 4 Satish,<br />              I think and I am sure there were born in the 70's.</p>
<p>              80's - the trend was to name the babies with A sounding or sh<br />    sounding<br />              names. Aashish, Aditya, Amritha, were quite common.</p>
<p>              Mostly in 70's and 80's the kids were named for fashion and no<br />    further<br />              reason. The name should sound modern and apealing.<br />              90's had a trend of short syllable names - Pyush, poorvi, Krish -<br />    just a few<br />              letters, short syllable.</p>
<p>              2000 - parents do have a lot cultural/spiritual/traditional<br />    inclinations<br />              and are hunting for traditional but rich sounding and meaning<br />    names.<br />              Shambhavi, Sibi, Samyuktha, Samravi, Saanvi, Aadeesh, etc.</p>
<p>              In fact, some people hunt for even pure tamil names. A few years<br />    back, in a<br />              marriage of our office colleague, I met one of my colleague and<br />    her husband<br />              and son. I was surprised to hear their son's name - 'Kavin'. They<br />    were in<br />              the US for more than 7 years and just had returned and their son<br />    was 4 years<br />              then. I told them, 'do you know the meaning of Kavin, its a 100%<br />    pure ultra<br />              refined Tamil name'. She said, yes, my husband was particular<br />    about a tamil<br />              name. In my previous company one of my colleague names his son<br />    'Kavin Mugil'<br />              - just 6 years ago.</p>
<p>              And we find that trend pretty much..many of our group membersare<br />    towards<br />              naming their kids as Poonguzhali, Kundavai etc.</p>
<p>              Thats the trend now.</p>
<p>              Just 40 years....and such a huge differences in naming pattern.<br />    Mainly<br />              attributed to the communication and knowledge availability of<br />    these decades<br />              makes these possible. What it took just 40 years would surely<br />    have taken 400<br />              years in the historic time frame we are talking about.</p>
<p>              And that perfectly matches your sangam - 600 years later time<br />    frame naming<br />              conventions. Does it not?</p>
<p>              Ofcourse, Mix is always there...without that 'Mix' and change,<br />    the world<br />              have come to a standstill long back.<br />              Its definitely not DIVIDE as you said, and you used the right<br />    word 'MIX'.</p>
<p>              //Brahmi<br />              Asokar Brahmi<br />              Tamil Brahmi etc.//</p>
<p>              Again, - Early Tamil movies - Sivaji movies - had loooooooong<br />    dialogues. Who<br />              can forget 'Parasakthi' and 'Manohara'. And the herioines hasto<br />    definitely<br />              say atleast 'Daddy-mummy'.<br />              Then the 70's saw 'yathartham' - Barathirajaa kind of stuff.</p>
<p>              80's saw 'en.......edhukku......en ippadi' in dark without<br />    clarity (in<br />              visual and dialogue - hope you understand whom I am referringto<br />    :) ) kind<br />              of dialogues.</p>
<p>              90's were more visual than dialogues...</p>
<p>              2000 - SMS language 'gr8 i hv d tkts fr d mv...lts mt at<br />    t8tr"....</p>
<p>              THough i was speaking about movies, the script and the dialogues<br />    were<br />              written and their form and language varies dramatically. (today<br />    no writing<br />              only typing).</p>
<p>              So in just 40 years so much change in the language we use andyou<br />    are trying<br />              to derive our history from 1000 year wide gap scripts......<br />              Is it possible to derive our history through those means is my<br />    questions? :)</p>

<p>                The similarities in the finds at Adhichanallur (recent ones)<br />    and<br />                Harappa (about 100 years back) Sind Province... need to be<br />    explained.</p>

<p>                There have been ayes and nos re several factors...</p>
<p>                We see most of the theories putforth in the past 25 - 30 years<br />    are not<br />                absolute... and changing... with newer finds / interpretations.</p>
<p>                The theory Aryan - Dravidian DIVIDE becomes a myth - when<br />    Adhichanallur and<br />                Harappa finds are compared... It appears the Word DIVIDE can be<br />    replaced<br />                with MIX.</p>
<p>                We have earlier posted an article in our Gp ... " Muruga " word<br />    related to<br />                Muruga existed is even prior to Sangam Origin !<br />                It is MURUKU having Sanskrit Origin.</p>
<p>                Again the word DIVIDE can be replaced with MIX.</p>
<p>                Saivism - from Mt Kailash at Mt Everest getting mixed with<br />    Nature worship /<br />                Aalamarselvan - ethnic Kotravai Vazhipadu etc.. at Indian<br />    Ocean.</p>
<p>                Lot of things need to be gone into before putting a concise<br />    postulate ..</p>
<p>                Subject paper appears to have diluted the DENSITY on the word<br />    DIVIDE.</p>

<p>            The theory Aryan - Dravidian DIVIDE becomes a myth - when Adhichanallur and<br />            Harappa finds are compared... It appears the Word DIVIDE can bereplaced<br />            with MIX.</p>
<p>            We have earlier posted an article in our Gp ... " Muruga " wordrelated to<br />            Muruga existed is even prior to Sangam Origin !<br />            It is MURUKU having Sanskrit Origin.</p>
<p>            Again the word DIVIDE can be replaced with MIX.</p>
<p>            Saivism - from Mt Kailash at Mt Everest getting mixed with Nature worship /<br />            Aalamarselvan - ethnic Kotravai Vazhipadu etc.. at Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>            Lot of things need to be gone into before putting a concise postulate ..</p>
<p>            Subject paper appears to have diluted the DENSITY on the word DIVIDE.</p>

<p>        SPS,</p>
<p>        My Great Grand father's name is 'Ramaswamy'. Grandfather - Subramaniyam.<br />        Father - Arunachalam; Me - Satish Kumar - My daugther - Shambhavi.</p>
<p>        Five generations - all pure sanskrit names. But Ramaswamy, Subramaniyam and<br />        Arunachalam are TODAY considered to be old fashioned names. Such names like<br />        Kuppaiah, Kuppusamy, Ramasamy, Annamalai - which today's generationmight<br />        ridicule at (surely if any one names their newly born kid as Ramasamy,<br />        atleast a few will say why such old fashioned name) were in vougue just a<br />        few decades back.</p>
<p>        In 70's born you can find a lot of Satish - this group has atleast 4 Satish,<br />        I think and I am sure there were born in the 70's.</p>
<p>        80's - the trend was to name the babies with A sounding or sh sounding<br />        names. Aashish, Aditya, Amritha, were quite common.</p>
<p>        Mostly in 70's and 80's the kids were named for fashion and no further<br />        reason. The name should sound modern and apealing.<br />        90's had a trend of short syllable names - Pyush, poorvi, Krish - just a few<br />        letters, short syllable.</p>
<p>        2000 - parents do have a lot cultural/spiritual/traditional inclinations<br />        and are hunting for traditional but rich sounding and meaning names.<br />        Shambhavi, Sibi, Samyuktha, Samravi, Saanvi, Aadeesh, etc.</p>
<p>        In fact, some people hunt for even pure tamil names. A few years back, in a<br />        marriage of our office colleague, I met one of my colleague and herhusband<br />        and son. I was surprised to hear their son's name - 'Kavin'. They were in<br />        the US for more than 7 years and just had returned and their son was 4 years<br />        then. I told them, 'do you know the meaning of Kavin, its a 100% pure ultra<br />        refined Tamil name'. She said, yes, my husband was particular abouta tamil<br />        name. In my previous company one of my colleague names his son 'Kavin Mugil'<br />        - just 6 years ago.</p>
<p>        And we find that trend pretty much..many of our group members are towards<br />        naming their kids as Poonguzhali, Kundavai etc.</p>
<p>        Thats the trend now.</p>
<p>        Just 40 years....and such a huge differences in naming pattern. Mainly<br />        attributed to the communication and knowledge availability of thesedecades<br />        makes these possible. What it took just 40 years would surely have taken 400<br />        years in the historic time frame we are talking about.</p>
<p>        And that perfectly matches your sangam - 600 years later time framenaming<br />        conventions. Does it not?</p>
<p>        Ofcourse, Mix is always there...without that 'Mix' and change, the world<br />        have come to a standstill long back.<br />        Its definitely not DIVIDE as you said, and you used the right word 'MIX'.</p>
<p>        //Brahmi<br />        Asokar Brahmi<br />        Tamil Brahmi etc.//</p>
<p>        Again, - Early Tamil movies - Sivaji movies - had loooooooong dialogues. Who<br />        can forget 'Parasakthi' and 'Manohara'. And the herioines has to definitely<br />        say atleast 'Daddy-mummy'.<br />        Then the 70's saw 'yathartham' - Barathirajaa kind of stuff.</p>
<p>        80's saw 'en.......edhukku......en ippadi' in dark without clarity (in<br />        visual and dialogue - hope you understand whom I am referring to :)) kind<br />        of dialogues.</p>
<p>        90's were more visual than dialogues...</p>
<p>        2000 - SMS language 'gr8 i hv d tkts fr d mv...lts mt at t8tr"....</p>
<p>        THough i was speaking about movies, the script and the dialogues were<br />        written and their form and language varies dramatically. (today no writing<br />        only typing).</p>
<p>        So in just 40 years so much change in the language we use and you are trying<br />        to derive our history from 1000 year wide gap scripts......<br />        Is it possible to derive our history through those means is my questions? :)</p>
<p>        Thanks,<br />        Satish</p>

<p>      Mostly in 70's and 80's the kids were named for fashion and no further<br />      reason. The name should sound modern and apealing.<br />      90's had a trend of short syllable names - Pyush, poorvi, Krish - just a few<br />      letters, short syllable.</p>
<p>      2000 - parents do have a lot cultural/spiritual/traditional inclinations<br />      and are hunting for traditional but rich sounding and meaning names.<br />      Shambhavi, Sibi, Samyuktha, Samravi, Saanvi, Aadeesh, etc.</p>
<p>      In fact, some people hunt for even pure tamil names. A few years back, in a<br />      marriage of our office colleague, I met one of my colleague and her husband<br />      and son. I was surprised to hear their son's name - 'Kavin'. They were in<br />      the US for more than 7 years and just had returned and their son was 4 years<br />      then. I told them, 'do you know the meaning of Kavin, its a 100% pureultra<br />      refined Tamil name'. She said, yes, my husband was particular about atamil<br />      name. In my previous company one of my colleague names his son 'KavinMugil'<br />      - just 6 years ago.</p>
<p>      And we find that trend pretty much..many of our group members are towards<br />      naming their kids as Poonguzhali, Kundavai etc.</p>
<p>      Thats the trend now.</p>
<p>      Just 40 years....and such a huge differences in naming pattern. Mainly<br />      attributed to the communication and knowledge availability of these decades<br />      makes these possible. What it took just 40 years would surely have taken 400<br />      years in the historic time frame we are talking about.</p>
<p>      And that perfectly matches your sangam - 600 years later time frame naming<br />      conventions. Does it not?</p>
<p>      Ofcourse, Mix is always there...without that 'Mix' and change, the world<br />      have come to a standstill long back.<br />      Its definitely not DIVIDE as you said, and you used the right word 'MIX'.</p>
<p>      //Brahmi<br />      Asokar Brahmi<br />      Tamil Brahmi etc.//</p>
<p>      Again, - Early Tamil movies - Sivaji movies - had loooooooong dialogues. Who<br />      can forget 'Parasakthi' and 'Manohara'. And the herioines has to definitely<br />      say atleast 'Daddy-mummy'.<br />      Then the 70's saw 'yathartham' - Barathirajaa kind of stuff.</p>
<p>      80's saw 'en.......edhukku......en ippadi' in dark without clarity (in<br />      visual and dialogue - hope you understand whom I am referring to :) )kind<br />      of dialogues.</p>
<p>      90's were more visual than dialogues...</p>
<p>      2000 - SMS language 'gr8 i hv d tkts fr d mv...lts mt at t8tr"....</p>
<p>      THough i was speaking about movies, the script and the dialogues were<br />      written and their form and language varies dramatically. (today no writing<br />      only typing).</p>
<p>      So in just 40 years so much change in the language we use and you aretrying<br />      to derive our history from 1000 year wide gap scripts......<br />      Is it possible to derive our history through those means is my questions? :)</p>
<p>      Thanks,<br />      Satish</p>

<p>        We have earlier posted an article in our Gp ... " Muruga " word related to<br />        Muruga existed is even prior to Sangam Origin !<br />        It is MURUKU having Sanskrit Origin.</p>
<p>        Again the word DIVIDE can be replaced with MIX.</p>
<p>        Saivism - from Mt Kailash at Mt Everest getting mixed with Nature worship /<br />        Aalamarselvan - ethnic Kotravai Vazhipadu etc.. at Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>    SPS,</p>
<p>    My Great Grand father's name is 'Ramaswamy'. Grandfather - Subramaniyam.<br />    Father - Arunachalam; Me - Satish Kumar - My daugther - Shambhavi.</p>
<p>    Five generations - all pure sanskrit names. But Ramaswamy, Subramaniyamand<br />    Arunachalam are TODAY considered to be old fashioned names. Such names like<br />    Kuppaiah, Kuppusamy, Ramasamy, Annamalai - which today's generation might<br />    ridicule at (surely if any one names their newly born kid as Ramasamy,<br />    atleast a few will say why such old fashioned name) were in vougue justa<br />    few decades back.</p>
<p>    In 70's born you can find a lot of Satish - this group has atleast 4 Satish,<br />    I think and I am sure there were born in the 70's.</p>
<p>    80's - the trend was to name the babies with A sounding or sh sounding<br />    names. Aashish, Aditya, Amritha, were quite common.</p>
<p>    Mostly in 70's and 80's the kids were named for fashion and no further<br />    reason. The name should sound modern and apealing.<br />    90's had a trend of short syllable names - Pyush, poorvi, Krish - just a few<br />    letters, short syllable.</p>
<p>    2000 - parents do have a lot cultural/spiritual/traditional inclinations<br />    and are hunting for traditional but rich sounding and meaning names.<br />    Shambhavi, Sibi, Samyuktha, Samravi, Saanvi, Aadeesh, etc.</p>
<p>    In fact, some people hunt for even pure tamil names. A few years back, in a<br />    marriage of our office colleague, I met one of my colleague and her husband<br />    and son. I was surprised to hear their son's name - 'Kavin'. They were in<br />    the US for more than 7 years and just had returned and their son was 4 years<br />    then. I told them, 'do you know the meaning of Kavin, its a 100% pure ultra<br />    refined Tamil name'. She said, yes, my husband was particular about a tamil<br />    name. In my previous company one of my colleague names his son 'Kavin Mugil'<br />    - just 6 years ago.</p>
<p>    And we find that trend pretty much..many of our group members are towards<br />    naming their kids as Poonguzhali, Kundavai etc.</p>
<p>    Thats the trend now.</p>
<p>    Just 40 years....and such a huge differences in naming pattern. Mainly<br />    attributed to the communication and knowledge availability of these decades<br />    makes these possible. What it took just 40 years would surely have taken 400<br />    years in the historic time frame we are talking about.</p>
<p>    And that perfectly matches your sangam - 600 years later time frame naming<br />    conventions. Does it not?</p>
<p>    Ofcourse, Mix is always there...without that 'Mix' and change, the world<br />    have come to a standstill long back.<br />    Its definitely not DIVIDE as you said, and you used the right word 'MIX'.</p>
<p>    //Brahmi<br />    Asokar Brahmi<br />    Tamil Brahmi etc.//</p>
<p>    Again, - Early Tamil movies - Sivaji movies - had loooooooong dialogues. Who<br />    can forget 'Parasakthi' and 'Manohara'. And the herioines has to definitely<br />    say atleast 'Daddy-mummy'.<br />    Then the 70's saw 'yathartham' - Barathirajaa kind of stuff.</p>
<p>    80's saw 'en.......edhukku......en ippadi' in dark without clarity (in<br />    visual and dialogue - hope you understand whom I am referring to :) ) kind<br />    of dialogues.</p>
<p>    90's were more visual than dialogues...</p>
<p>    2000 - SMS language 'gr8 i hv d tkts fr d mv...lts mt at t8tr"....</p>
<p>    THough i was speaking about movies, the script and the dialogues were<br />    written and their form and language varies dramatically. (today no writing<br />    only typing).</p>
<p>    So in just 40 years so much change in the language we use and you are trying<br />    to derive our history from 1000 year wide gap scripts......<br />    Is it possible to derive our history through those means is my questions? :)</p>
<p>    Thanks,<br />    Satish</p>

          Times of India - Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear,<br />?In our family, our practice is name the first child of his father's name.. I am Kailasam. My father name is Lakshmanan, I was compelled by my mother and other relatives to name my first son as Lakshmanan. However we were given liberty to name the second child. However due to my wife's abnormal pressure I name the second child as Subramaninan, her father's name. This practice was adopted geneations together.</p>
<p>I got more affection to subramanian than to lakshmanan and the vice versa for my wife. Now both of us last our fathers. But their memories could be cherished by calling our children. But in this age it is not possible or practicable to compel our children to name our name to their children.</p>

<p>?</p>
<p>SPS,</p>
<p>My Great Grand father's name is 'Ramaswamy'. Grandfather - Subramaniyam. Father - Arunachalam; Me - Satish Kumar - My daugther - Shambhavi.</p>
<p>Five generations - all pure sanskrit names. But Ramaswamy, Subramaniyam andArunachalam are TODAY considered to be old fashioned names. Such names like Kuppaiah, Kuppusamy, Ramasamy, Annamalai - which today's generation mightridicule at (surely if any one names their newly born kid as Ramasamy, atleast a few will say why such old fashioned name) were in vougue just a few decades back.</p>
<p>In 70's born you can find a lot of Satish - this group has atleast 4 Satish, I think and I am sure there were born in the 70's.</p>
<p>80's - the trend was to name the babies with A sounding or sh sounding names. Aashish, Aditya, Amritha, were quite common.</p>
<p>Mostly in 70's and 80's the kids were named for fashion and no further reason. The name should sound modern and apealing.<br />90's had a trend of short syllable names - Pyush, poorvi, Krish - just a few letters, short syllable.</p>
<p>2000 - parents do have? a lot cultural/spiritual/ traditional inclinations and are hunting for traditional but rich sounding and meaning names. Shambhavi, Sibi, Samyuktha, Samravi, Saanvi, Aadeesh, etc.</p>
<p>In fact, some people hunt for even pure tamil names. A few years back, in amarriage of our office colleague, I met one of my colleague and her husband and son. I was surprised to hear their son's name - 'Kavin'. They were inthe US for more than 7 years and just had returned and their son was 4 years then. I told them, 'do you know the meaning of Kavin, its a 100% pure ultra refined Tamil name'. She said, yes, my husband was particular about a tamil name. In my previous company one of my colleague names his son 'Kavin Mugil' - just 6 years ago.</p>
<p>And we find that trend pretty much..many of our group members are towards naming their kids as Poonguzhali, Kundavai etc.</p>
<p>Thats the trend now.</p>
<p>Just 40 years....and such a huge differences in naming pattern. Mainly attributed to the communication and knowledge availability of these decades makes these possible. What it took just 40 years would surely have taken 400 years in the historic time frame we are talking about.</p>
<p>And that perfectly matches your sangam - 600 years later time frame naming conventions. Does it not?</p>
<p>Ofcourse, Mix is always there...without that 'Mix' and change, the world have come to a standstill long back. </p>
<p>Its definitely not DIVIDE as you said, and you used the right word 'MIX'..</p>
<p>//Brahmi</p>
<p>Asokar Brahmi</p>
<p>Tamil Brahmi etc.//</p>
<p>Again, - Early Tamil movies - Sivaji movies - had loooooooong dialogues. Who can forget 'Parasakthi' and 'Manohara'. And the herioines has to definitely say atleast 'Daddy-mummy'.</p>
<p>Then the 70's saw 'yathartham' - Barathirajaa kind of stuff. </p>
<p>80's saw 'en.......edhukku. .....en ippadi' in dark without clarity (in visual and dialogue - hope you understand whom I am referring to :) ) kind of dialogues.</p>
<p>90's were more visual than dialogues...</p>
<p>2000 - SMS language 'gr8 i hv d tkts fr d mv...lts mt at t8tr"....</p>
<p>THough i was speaking about movies, the script and the dialogues were written and their form and language varies dramatically. (today no writing only typing).</p>
<p>So in just 40 years so much change in the language we use and you are trying to derive our history from 1000 year wide gap scripts..... .<br />Is it possible to derive our history through those means is my questions? :)</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Satish</p>

          Times of India - Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Certain facts need explanation.</p>
<p>Yanaiikann chey Mandhalirunchera Irumporai - Chera (Sangam)</p>
<p>Thalayananganathu cheru vendra Nedunchezhian - Pandya (Sangam)</p>
<p>Kulamutrathu thunjiya Killivalavan - Chola.(Sangam)</p>
<p>Subsequently - over a period of say about 600 years,</p>
<p>Chera name changed :: for example, Baskara Marthanda ravi varma</p>
<p>Pandya - Sundara Pandian chola : Sundara cholan</p>
<p>The similarities in the finds at Adhichanallur (recent ones) and<br />Harappa (about 100 years back) Sind Province... need to be explained.</p>
<p>Brahmi<br />Asokar Brahmi<br />Tamil Brahmi etc.</p>
<p>There have been ayes and nos re several factors...</p>
<p>We see most of the theories putforth in the past 25 - 30 years are not absolute... and changing... with newer finds / interpretations.</p>
<p>The theory Aryan - Dravidian DIVIDE becomes a myth - when Adhichanallur andHarappa finds are compared... It appears the Word DIVIDE can be replaced with MIX.</p>
<p>We have earlier posted an article in our Gp ... " Muruga " word related to Muruga existed is even prior to Sangam Origin ! <br />It is MURUKU having Sanskrit Origin.</p>
<p>Again the word DIVIDE can be replaced with MIX.</p>
<p>Saivism - from Mt Kailash at Mt Everest getting mixed with Nature worship /Aalamarselvan - ethnic Kotravai Vazhipadu etc.. at Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Lot of things need to be gone into before putting a concise postulate ..</p>
<p>Subject paper appears to have diluted the DENSITY on the word DIVIDE.</p>
<p>Let us get to know more.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the myth was invented to give oppressed people some identity and battle casteism. One reason. Second, the still prevelant obsession with fair skin among both so called 'aryan's and dravidians..wonder where that came from??</p>
<p>Third, mis interpretation of classics (am deliberately avoiding myths) suchas Ramayana as a hero vs villian story which it is not so someone felt it necessary to justify the villian.</p>

          Times of India - Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi <br />the more you read of logistics in those days its seems unbeleivable that one race dark in color and south of the vindyas and one race fairskinned north of the vindyas were battling each other and maintainng a seperate identity.<br />to a southerner living in madurai, delhi or punjab were as alien as usbekistan or tajdikistan is to us today.<br />it would have taken a person a year to travel to delhi and a year back if he started immidietly. where is this question of rivalry.<br />I think none before pulikesi crossed the vindyas in a mentionable way.<br />it was malik kafur after him.<br />then tuklaqs and mughals.<br />i am sure the aryan invasion is a huge huge myth.perhaps a slow migration was compressed as a hurried invasion.</p>

        <p>Interesting</p>
<p>Between 135,000 and 75,000 years ago, the East-African droughts shrunk the water volume of the lake Malawi by at least 95%, causing migration out of Africa. Which route did they take? </p>
<p>-- Is this not quite a time line, how was the world geographically mapped then ? What tools / marra kalams did these guys use to cross over the ocean.How did the african animals survive, especially the big ones without water?</p>
<p>The theory seems alrite though, migration seems the only way out, but logicmakes me think that land would have been more preferre than a water loggedpath way, esp embarkation into andaman than maldives or lakswadeep..</p>

<p>The study analysed 500,000 genetic markers across the genomes of 132 individuals from 25 diverse groups from 13 states. All the individuals were from six-language families and traditionally ``upper'' and ``lower'' castes and tribal groups. ``The genetics proves that castes grew directly out of tribe-like organizations during the formation of the Indian society,'' the studysaid. Thangarajan noted that it was impossible to distinguish between castes and tribes since their genetics proved they were not systematically different. </p>
