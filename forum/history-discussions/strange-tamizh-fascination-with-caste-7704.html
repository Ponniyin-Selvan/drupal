</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>My wife had a rather disconcerting episode recently. There is a Tamil family<br />here who have recently returned from the US. They have a daughter who is in<br />class 6 and who has been thrown into the deep end, learning Kannada. My<br />wife, who grew up in Mysore, is fluent in Kannada and offered to teach the<br />kid. The mother agreed. The daughter also attended a couple of lessons. Then<br />the mother came and told my wife that since the Kannada teacher in school<br />was bad, she was going to shift her to a Sanskrit class. So far so good.<br />Yesterday, our maid, who works in their house to said that the lady's father<br />had raised strong objections to the child being taught by a Brahmin and that<br />was the reason for stopping the tuition. We were aghast when we heard that.<br />This of course was not the first such incident here. Another Tamil lady,<br />stopped talking to my wife once she came to know that we were Brahmins. If<br />educated people still have prejudices about caste, how the devil are we ever<br />going to get rid of caste?</p>
<p>Pretty depressed by the whole thing.</p>
<p>(And this in Bangalore!! I wonder what the feeling is like in Tamizh Nadu).</p>

<p>Arun</p>

<p>      Agree with this and possibly, they have had significant  <br />    contributions<br />      through the 19th and 20th centuries (at least first half of the 10th<br />      century). One thing I admire is the lack of a feudal attitude at  <br />    least among<br />      the educated. Unlike our habit of "thalaivar and thondan) there  <br />    is, like you<br />      said, more emphasis on intellectual ability.<br />      Example, if you look at a political rally in Kolkata, you will  <br />    find people<br />      from all walks of life, lawyers, scientists, engineers, bankers  <br />    etc etc..<br />      Not like our rent-a-lorry-crowd with more of the thalaivar- <br />    thondan types.<br />      Regards,</p>

<p>        My experience after a few years in Calcutta is that the Bengali  <br />    pride is<br />        very different from ours and more similar to Keralites. Of  <br />    course i am 100%<br />        aware of the fact that we are generalizing here. Tamils do not  <br />    have a<br />        'superiorty feeling' (or atleast we are very poor at showing  <br />    it!!) we only<br />        have pride and affinity perhaps. Keralites and Bengalis  <br />    actually harbor a<br />        sense of superiority and dislike being compared to others. I  <br />    have rarely met<br />        a Bengali who does not believe their contribution to indian  <br />    culture is<br />        superior and more than other states - Bengalis don't even like  <br />    to be called<br />        'northern indians', they are extremely intelligent and well  <br />    educated<br />        generally but will never compliment any other state or sub  <br />    culture openly.<br />        For them Bengal is India and vice versa.</p>
<p>        Another classic perhaps very positive evidence of this pride -  <br />    there are no<br />        movie fan clubs anywhere in Kerala or Bengal. Nobody is  <br />    elevated to higher<br />        level by populist strategies and it is only ego/intelligence  <br />    that scores.<br />        And dont' get into an argument on this with any Bengali you are  <br />    more than<br />        likely to back off if you see the reaction!!</p>

<p>          I don't think you can call it bigotry exactly Venketesh.  <br />    Bigotry deals<br />        with<br />          hatred for something. The Bengali or Tamil love for their  <br />    culture or<br />          language is smugness rather than bigotry. I would use the  <br />    word bigotry<br />        with<br />          great care.

        <p>I was fascinated with my last trip to Kolkatta.<br />It was a pleasant surprise for me to see school kids in their later teens visiting the Tagore museum observing and taking notes on various poems etc<br />The place itself was very serene. Well maintained and clean kept. The people who visited it seem to understand the importance of the place.<br />I was impressed.</p>
<p>We have monuments too, but I am yet to find kids interested in reading about them.</p>
<p>Kolkatta has produced some of the finest scholars in time, whereas we from the quotes of 'Nagareshu Kaanchi' have gone down to 'rent a lorry'. It it aint so pathetic, it would be counted as sad.</p>

        <p>Agree with this and possibly, they have had significant contributions<br />through the 19th and 20th centuries (at least first half of the 10th<br />century). One thing I admire is the lack of a feudal attitude at least among<br />the educated. Unlike our habit of "thalaivar and thondan) there is, like you<br />said, more emphasis on intellectual ability.<br />Example, if you look at a political rally in Kolkata, you will find people<br />from all walks of life, lawyers, scientists, engineers, bankers etc etc..<br />Not like our rent-a-lorry-crowd with more of the thalaivar-thondan types.<br />Regards,</p>

          The strange Tamizh fascination with caste...        </div>

        <p>I agree that Bengalis tend to be very proud of their culture (somewhat like<br />us Tamils isn't it?). That <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym of cultural superiority might be irritating,<br />but it is definitely not caste based.<br />Regards,</acronym></p>

They have a daughter<br />  who<br />      is<br />          in<br />            class 6 and who has been thrown into the deep end, learning<br />  Kannada.<br />      My<br />            wife, who grew up in Mysore, is fluent in Kannada and offered to<br />      teach<br />          the<br />            kid. The mother agreed. The daughter also attended a couple of<br />      lessons.<br />          Then<br />            the mother came and told my wife that since the Kannada teacher<br />  in<br />      school<br />            was bad, she was going to shift her to a Sanskrit class. So far<br />  so<br />      good.<br />            Yesterday, our maid, who works in their house to said that the<br />  lady's<br />          father<br />            had raised strong objections to the child being taught by a<br />  Brahmin<br />      and<br />          that<br />            was the reason for stopping the tuition. We were aghast when we<br />  heard<br />          that.<br />            This of course was not the first such incident here. Another<br />  Tamil<br />      lady,<br />            stopped talking to my wife once she came to know that we were<br />      Brahmins.<br />          If<br />            educated people still have prejudices about caste, how the devil<br />  are<br />      we<br />          ever<br />            going to get rid of caste?</p>
<p>            Pretty depressed by the whole thing.</p>

<p>      Hi Arun, that is really very unusual in Bangalore..which part of the<br />  city<br />      do you live? Is it a predominantly tamil area? (Just fyi to you the<br />  majority<br />      bangalore tamils are not brahmins altho i have rarely heard of them<br />      harboring any resentment). Also have not heard much of anti brahmin<br />  feelings<br />      in Bangalore, even having lived there 25+ years - anti tamil feelings<br />  became<br />      somewhat common after raise of regionalism in the late 90s but this<br />  appears<br />      to be different..very unusual indeed..</p>
<p>      If you have time please check out the local Tamil Sangam for friends,<br />  used<br />      to be near ulsoor lake.</p>

<p>Yes Arun<br />our previous experiences with caste related topics have been heated and caused a lot of ill will.</p>
<p>writer vikraman yesterday described to us how in malaysia during a writer meet somebody got up and used a offensive caste based term for 3 women writers sivasankari, anuradha ramanan and (somebody else i forget.)<br />he also explained how he handled it.</p>

        <p>Actually, the place we stay (Yelahanka) are very few tamils. In the<br />apartment complex we stay in, there are maybe 4 tamil families (out of over<br />350). this is why it was strange. These aren't Bangalore Tamilians, so I am<br />assuming anti-Brahmin feelings in TN still run deep.<br />This was quite incredible for me. And the fact that this happened twice,<br />with two different families just reinforced to me that it wasn't an isolated<br />incidence.</p>
<p>Again, the fact that there are so few responses to this on the forum<br />probably implies that feelings still run deep or that this is still a<br />"touchy" topic to discuss.</p>
