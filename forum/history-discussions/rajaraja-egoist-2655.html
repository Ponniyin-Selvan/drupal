<p>  Venkatesh sir::: your masterstroke "RajaRajaChozhan was the Biggest <br />  Egoist" is confirmed...<br />=========================================</p></blockquote>
<p>WE ARE IN AGREEMENT THE MOMENT WE HEAR THE NAME "RAJA RAJA" - @ - <br />KING OF KINGS - THAT HE IS EGOIST! BUT NOT FOR NOTHING. <br />HE DESERVES TO BE THE EGOIST.</p>
<p>BUT RE-CASTE BASED COMMENTS, I THINK WE SHOULD EDUCATE OURSELVES <br />BETTER BEFORE COMING IN A FORUM.</p>
<p>DIWAKAR WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WHO HEARD KUDAVOIL DR.BALU SAYING <br />IN BIG TEMPLE COMPLEX :</p>
<p>RAJARAJA was having love and affection on his sub-ordinates and <br />regarded their work and so permitted the Big Temple Construction <br />Enginner to be named after him as RAJARAJA PERUNTHACHAN !</p>
<p>Same way, he permitted the use of the name RAJARAJA PERU NAAVITHAN to <br />his Parlour specialist.</p>
<p>We have already read of Vikrama Chozha Moovenda Velalar changing his <br />name as RAJARAJA MOOVENDA VELALAR!</p>
<p>Anirudh's son named as Arumozhi Brahmadhirayar !</p>
<p>These are enough that he recognised MERITS.</p>
<p>We have fundamental rights to express, no doubt. </p>
<p>But let us try to express Truth.</p>
<p>Re Ego, he was Supreme as a King (of Kings).</p>
<p>Look at the mix of King - Sivanadiyar Combo : there was Seraman <br />Perumal, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's role model. Went alone to Kailasam.<br />But <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  brought Kailasam - Dakshina Meru - for everyone to worship in <br />Thanjai!</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Reminds me of Tirukkottiyur Sri Ramanujar inviting everyone to learn <br />the Manthra that would lead them to Vaikuntam inspite of knowing he <br />would attract the displeasure of his Guru :: It was him reaching <br />Vaikuntam alone Vs masses reaching Vaikuntam. Sri Ramanujar chose <br />the masses.</p>
<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  also chose the masses.</p>
<p>He is the best as Rajarajan. </p>
<p>He is the best as Sivapatha Sekaran!</p>
<p>If he is not egoistic, we will consider him as a hypocritic.</p>

          RAJARAJA :: EGOIST ?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Correct,</p>
<p>But Raja Thandaram, also includes, to assign one to the job, who may <br />be fit enough to finish it off. Rajendhra made 'Arrayan Rajarajan' <br />to be the Commander in chief for Gangai war. So, does that mean the <br />credits go to Arayan Rajarajan? Similarly does the credits go to <br />Karunakara Thondaiman for Kalinga War and not Kulothunga? Partly <br />yes, but not completly.</p>
<p>Mouth or Tail Ganges is Ganges. When you hit the person on mouth. <br />You have actually hit the person, this is first. On mouth is next <br />level of importance. While cpturing Kalinga, even Karunakara <br />Thondaiman, could have crossed many cities, towns villages etc. So, <br />Kulothunga has won against each of this, but the prime importance is <br />for Kalinga.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Rajendra cholan,</p>
<p>  The question here is did he really possess those attributes or <br />just <br />  extra fittings???</p>
<p>  to my knowledge RRc had done only two wars in his lifetime.... It <br />  was rajendra who was the real emperor of a large kingdom .. it is <br />  rajendracholan's desire ( orey perumaiyaarukkume ungalukku) to <br />build <br />  a big and vast kadal kadandha empire....</p>
<p>  adhukooda to my knowledge Rajendra cholan cannot be called "Gangai <br />  Konda cholan" and his capital "Gangai Konda Cholapuram"..</p>
<p>  it wud be very apt to call him as "HOOGLY KONDA CHOLAN" and his <br />  capital "HOOGLY KONDA CHOLAPURAM"</p>
<p>  coz he touched ganges at his mouth .. may be he had a huge desire <br />  for capturing delta's.... Tanjai the capital delta <br />and "sunderbans" <br />  the tailend delta of his kingdom...</p>

<p>    There might be man kings, who crossed north. Few are Pandian <br />    Nediyon, Pandian palyaaga saalai Mudhukudumi peruvazhuthi, <br />    Karikaalan Perumthirumaavalavan, Imayavaramban neduncheralathan, <br />    Cheran Chenkoottuvan, Aariya padai kadantha paandian <br />nedunchezian. </p>
<p>    But Raja Raja, performed this act and gave stability, whihc may <br />be <br />    because of his administration tactics, which may have been <br />  followed <br />    by his successors. As a gesture of respect there had been Three <br />  Raja <br />    Raja in Chola lineage after him (there are Kulothunga and <br />    Rajendhra's too).</p>
<p>    He sponsered litrture and arts. 'Kottaattu Paattu', kottu aattu <br />    paattu, percusion dance and singing (Music), was developed by <br />him <br />    very much, as Late Paramachaariar swamigal mentioned in <br />    his 'Dheivathin Kural', when he speaks about Thiruotriyur.</p>
<p>    Mohiniyaatam is belived to be developed by Raja Raja and have <br />  taken <br />    refuge in Cheranaadu.</p>
<p>    Not to mention about his interts in arts. after reading about <br />  group <br />    mails in Tanjai painting.</p>
<p>    Even if he is a egoist, there are innumerous attributes, that he <br />    posses to feel so.</p>

<p>      Dear Sir,</p>
<p>      My points were just an observation of what Mr. sampath had <br />  mailed <br />      quoting a book written by somebody.. but i wud stil putforth <br />    certain <br />      points.</p>
<p>      1. RajaRajaChozhan Yes was one of the greatest kings that <br />      tamizhagam ever produced.. but whether He is the King of Kings <br />  is <br />    a <br />      point which needs to be deserved..... as u said earlier a <br />  concise <br />      work on the factual happennings are not yet recorded and a lot <br />    needs <br />      to be discovered..Rajendra think is better than rajaraja in <br />      expanding the kingdom</p>
<p>      2. No iam not saying that a point which has not been <br />discovered <br />  is <br />      not true.. what i mean is that it is a question of debate... </p>
<p>      3. My feeling is that there has been an aura of invincibility <br />      created around Rajaraja by people like Kalki and other writers <br />    which <br />      we are following..</p>
<p>      4. Request you to kindly recollect the controversies <br />surrounding <br />    who <br />      the real mamalla is.. People thought it was Narasimhavarma <br />    Pallavan <br />      I and now people talk of Rajasimhan as mamalla... iam not <br />    disputing <br />      the claim that bigtemple has been built by RRC. what is mean <br />is <br />    that <br />      Kalki's hand is behind a lot of things behind RRc. RRC owes a <br />  lot <br />    to <br />      Kalki</p>
<p>      5. Whether he built the temple for the massess is a question <br />  next.<br />      had he really been intersted in people worshipping , i think <br />as <br />  a <br />      prudent ruler RRC wud have built lot of temples in his entire <br />  land <br />      and not in tanjai alone.. as u said earlier he is a clear <br />  egoist...</p>
<p>      6. Iam not an expert and i cannot deny that he allowed his <br />  people <br />    to <br />      use his name .. but was that real??? u might recall the RRC <br />  movie <br />      by sivaji ganesan wherein he was holding a spitton for a <br />      sthapathi... was itt rue?? </p>
<p>      Pls let me know whether the things as allowing somebody to use <br />  the <br />      name and is proved beyond doubt when people still question the <br />      administration capability of Cholas???</p>
<p>      as rightly pointed out by Mr. Venkatesh, Pandyas as a race <br />have <br />    been <br />      there for long.. cholas were so obsessed with madurai and lot <br />of <br />      pattapeyars had madurantakan ... during wars the inscriptions <br />of <br />      pandyas the great deeds of pandyas might have been ruined .... <br />  and <br />      RRC since a recent king ( around 1000 years back) might be <br />      standing... just because one does not find a glorifying <br />    inscription <br />      of Pandya or say any other king for that matter , doesnt <br />  denigrade <br />      the other Kings</p>
<p>      as u said earlier, lot of works are not comprehensive and <br />before <br />      things are proved beyond a point i think the question " <br />whether <br />    or <br />      not he deserves to be a egoist" till date has no answer.</p>
<p>      But one thing is absolutely clear .. He was at his best in <br />      Brandbuilding or Public Relations.. his PR agent in recent <br />times <br />      being Kalki.</p>

<p>          sampath ji,</p>
<p>          enna solla vareenga... appadinaa RajaRajaChozhan was a <br />    vehement <br />          supporter of Caste based discrimination that he wanted <br />  people <br />    of <br />          supposedly higher caste to serve him....</p>
<p>          may be ... "paathengalaa... iyamaarungale enakku sevagam <br />          panraanga....naan evvalavu periya aalu" nnu <br />          paraisaatruvadharkkaagavaa???</p>
<p>          Venkatesh sir::: your masterstroke "RajaRajaChozhan was <br />the <br />      Biggest <br />          Egoist" is confirmed...<br />        =========================================<br />        WE ARE IN AGREEMENT THE MOMENT WE HEAR THE NAME "RAJA RAJA" -</p>
<p>  @ -</p>
<p>        KING OF KINGS - THAT HE IS EGOIST! BUT NOT FOR NOTHING. <br />        HE DESERVES TO BE THE EGOIST.</p>
<p>        BUT RE-CASTE BASED COMMENTS, I THINK WE SHOULD EDUCATE <br />  OURSELVES <br />        BETTER BEFORE COMING IN A FORUM.</p>
<p>        DIWAKAR WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WHO HEARD KUDAVOIL <br />DR.BALU <br />      SAYING <br />        IN BIG TEMPLE COMPLEX :</p>
<p>        RAJARAJA was having love and affection on his sub-ordinates <br />  and <br />        regarded their work and so permitted the Big Temple <br />  Construction <br />        Enginner to be named after him as RAJARAJA PERUNTHACHAN !</p>
<p>        Same way, he permitted the use of the name RAJARAJA PERU <br />    NAAVITHAN <br />      to <br />        his Parlour specialist.</p>
<p>        We have already read of Vikrama Chozha Moovenda Velalar <br />  changing <br />      his <br />        name as RAJARAJA MOOVENDA VELALAR!</p>
<p>        Anirudh's son named as Arumozhi Brahmadhirayar !</p>
<p>        These are enough that he recognised MERITS.</p>
<p>        We have fundamental rights to express, no doubt. </p>
<p>        But let us try to express Truth.</p>
<p>        Re Ego, he was Supreme as a King (of Kings).</p>
<p>        Look at the mix of King - Sivanadiyar Combo : there was <br />  Seraman <br />        Perumal, RR's role model. Went alone to Kailasam.<br />        But RR brought Kailasam - Dakshina Meru - for everyone to <br />    worship <br />      in <br />        Thanjai!</p>
<p>        Reminds me of Tirukkottiyur Sri Ramanujar inviting everyone <br />to <br />      learn <br />        the Manthra that would lead them to Vaikuntam inspite of <br />  knowing <br />      he <br />        would attract the displeasure of his Guru :: It was him <br />  reaching <br />        Vaikuntam alone Vs masses reaching Vaikuntam. Sri Ramanujar <br />    chose <br />        the masses.</p>
<p>        RR also chose the masses.</p>
<p>        He is the best as Rajarajan. </p>
<p>        He is the best as Sivapatha Sekaran!</p>
<p>        If he is not egoistic, we will consider him as a hypocritic.</p>

<p>Neenga pesaama naraya nagaichuvai katturaigal ezhudhalaam, especially<br />after reading your last paragraph about Marketing is a branch of<br />science. Good one.</p>
<p>Yes, got the google definition of "scientific theory". :-))</p>
<p>Please do write about Thomas Kuhn's philisophy of science. I am eager<br />to know about this article.</p>
<p>Aside from that, from what you have said NHST is to find out what is<br />wrong and what is right, right? I take it NHST concludes hypothesis in<br />history would turn the path of a researcher to find proof for his<br />theory whereas it would be more apt to conclude issues based on facts<br />and correlation.</p>

<p>      Of course there can be hypothesis in social sciences, but <br />mostly<br />      (another wrong word to use in Logic..ha ha..) the results will <br />not <br />    be correct...especially in the case of history. It is evident <br />from <br />    what we perceived as our history not before that long.</p>
<p>      Do you think there can be hypothesis in History?</p>
<p>    ------------ Thailaiva,In every field of research there is <br />    hypothesis.Without hypothesis we can close down every research <br />    field.For example every field uses statistics to test <br />hypothesis.In <br />    statistics we have Null hypothesis significance testing(NHST) <br />which <br />    is there purely for testing hypothesis.</p>
<p>    History too heavily hypothesizes.History actually is "His <br />    story".Based on evidence we have we create hypothesis and <br />theories <br />    in every field.History is no exception.</p>
<p>      At least theory explains something. But hypothesis concludes<br />      everything. Studying history is to find out what has <br />happened... <br />    not to invent anything new from what has happened. If 'what has <br />    happened' is a guess work/hypothesis, then what we discover from <br />    such a hypothesis would also be another hypothesis and would be <br />    wrong.</p>
<p>    ------------- Hypothesis is an untested assumption.When it is <br />tested <br />    and proved it becomes a theory.Description and prediction of a <br />    phenomena is theory.</p>
<p>    There is no way to know "what really happened".If that is what <br />you <br />    think you get from history,you will be disappointed.History only <br />    tells you "This might have happened.We say so based on this <br />    evidence..".If you think history or any social science to tell <br />    you 'exactly what happened', you will be thoroughly disappointed.</p>
<p>    A historian doesnt have video camera recordings of past to <br />    know 'what exactly happened'.He is a detective.Like how police <br />spins <br />    a story based on availaible evidence, a historian too spins a <br />story <br />    based on availaible evidence.Many times he fills the gaps with <br />other <br />    fields like sociology,psychology,theology etc.</p>
<p>    History without guesswork is dead.Any field without guesswork is <br />    dead.Natural sciences too are no exceptions to this.</p>

<p>    Of course there can be hypothesis in social sciences, but mostly<br />    (another wrong word to use in Logic..ha ha..) the results will not <br />  be correct...especially in the case of history. It is evident from <br />  what we perceived as our history not before that long.</p>
<p>    Do you think there can be hypothesis in History?</p>
<p>  ------------ Thailaiva,In every field of research there is <br />  hypothesis.Without hypothesis we can close down every research <br />  field.For example every field uses statistics to test hypothesis.In <br />  statistics we have Null hypothesis significance testing(NHST) which <br />  is there purely for testing hypothesis.</p>
<p>  History too heavily hypothesizes.History actually is "His <br />  story".Based on evidence we have we create hypothesis and theories <br />  in every field.History is no exception.</p>
<p>    At least theory explains something. But hypothesis concludes<br />    everything. Studying history is to find out what has happened... <br />  not to invent anything new from what has happened. If 'what has <br />  happened' is a guess work/hypothesis, then what we discover from <br />  such a hypothesis would also be another hypothesis and would be <br />  wrong.</p>
<p>  ------------- Hypothesis is an untested assumption.When it is tested <br />  and proved it becomes a theory.Description and prediction of a <br />  phenomena is theory.</p>
<p>  There is no way to know "what really happened".If that is what you <br />  think you get from history,you will be disappointed.History only <br />  tells you "This might have happened.We say so based on this <br />  evidence..".If you think history or any social science to tell <br />  you 'exactly what happened', you will be thoroughly disappointed.</p>
<p>  A historian doesnt have video camera recordings of past to <br />  know 'what exactly happened'.He is a detective.Like how police spins <br />  a story based on availaible evidence, a historian too spins a story <br />  based on availaible evidence.Many times he fills the gaps with other <br />  fields like sociology,psychology,theology etc.</p>
<p>  History without guesswork is dead.Any field without guesswork is <br />  dead.Natural sciences too are no exceptions to this.</p>

<blockquote><p>  GOOD thread. </p>
<p>  Dear Sampath,</p>
<p>  RR call Ravidasan and co as 'Drohigal' in udayarkudi kalvettu. <br />  Ravidasan and co are brahmins. After knowing that his brother was <br />  killed by brahmins how can he trust them? How can he think that <br />  Brahmins wont conspire against him after witnessing a conspiracy?<br />  Any further thoughts ? ( as usual enakku kekkathan theriyum)</p></blockquote>
<p>------------- Satish,This is my pure guesswork.</p>
<p>ravidasan&amp;co were pandya bhramins.maybe rajaraja got impressed by <br />their devotion to their king.Many years after their kings death they <br />were still loyal to him.Maybe this played in mind of Rajaraja.</p>
<p>Again..This is my guess....</p>

        <p>Of course it is customary to prefix "Dr." before a doctor's name,<br />followed by his credentials. Ditto with Engineers, MBAs, PhDs.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Rajendra cholan,</p>
<p>The question here is did he really possess those attributes or just <br />extra fittings???</p>
<p>to my knowledge <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  had done only two wars in his lifetime.... It <br />was rajendra who was the real emperor of a large kingdom .. it is <br />rajendracholan's desire ( orey perumaiyaarukkume ungalukku) to build <br />a big and vast kadal kadandha empire....</acronym></p>
<p>adhukooda to my knowledge Rajendra cholan cannot be called "Gangai <br />Konda cholan" and his capital "Gangai Konda Cholapuram"..</p>
<p>it wud be very apt to call him as "HOOGLY KONDA CHOLAN" and his <br />capital "HOOGLY KONDA CHOLAPURAM"</p>
<p>coz he touched ganges at his mouth .. may be he had a huge desire <br />for capturing delta's.... Tanjai the capital delta and "sunderbans" <br />the tailend delta of his kingdom...</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Rajendhra Cholan!" <br /><rajendhracholan@y...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  The Great Raja Raja, was the King, who did expand the Tamil Dhesam <br />  beyond boudaries and made is stand stable, for atleast next two <br />  hundred years.</p>
<p>  There might be man kings, who crossed north. Few are Pandian <br />  Nediyon, Pandian palyaaga saalai Mudhukudumi peruvazhuthi, <br />  Karikaalan Perumthirumaavalavan, Imayavaramban neduncheralathan, <br />  Cheran Chenkoottuvan, Aariya padai kadantha paandian nedunchezian. </p>
<p>  But Raja Raja, performed this act and gave stability, whihc may be <br />  because of his administration tactics, which may have been <br />followed <br />  by his successors. As a gesture of respect there had been Three <br />Raja <br />  Raja in Chola lineage after him (there are Kulothunga and <br />  Rajendhra's too).</p>
<p>  He sponsered litrture and arts. 'Kottaattu Paattu', kottu aattu <br />  paattu, percusion dance and singing (Music), was developed by him <br />  very much, as Late Paramachaariar swamigal mentioned in <br />  his 'Dheivathin Kural', when he speaks about Thiruotriyur.</p>
<p>  Mohiniyaatam is belived to be developed by Raja Raja and have <br />taken <br />  refuge in Cheranaadu.</p>
<p>  Not to mention about his interts in arts. after reading about <br />group <br />  mails in Tanjai painting.</p>
<p>  Even if he is a egoist, there are innumerous attributes, that he <br />  posses to feel so.</p>

<p>    Dear Sir,</p>
<p>    My points were just an observation of what Mr. sampath had <br />mailed <br />    quoting a book written by somebody.. but i wud stil putforth <br />  certain <br />    points.</p>
<p>    1. RajaRajaChozhan Yes was one of the greatest kings that <br />    tamizhagam ever produced.. but whether He is the King of Kings <br />is <br />  a <br />    point which needs to be deserved..... as u said earlier a <br />concise <br />    work on the factual happennings are not yet recorded and a lot <br />  needs <br />    to be discovered..Rajendra think is better than rajaraja in <br />    expanding the kingdom</p>
<p>    2. No iam not saying that a point which has not been discovered <br />is <br />    not true.. what i mean is that it is a question of debate... </p>
<p>    3. My feeling is that there has been an aura of invincibility <br />    created around Rajaraja by people like Kalki and other writers <br />  which <br />    we are following..</p>
<p>    4. Request you to kindly recollect the controversies surrounding <br />  who <br />    the real mamalla is.. People thought it was Narasimhavarma <br />  Pallavan <br />    I and now people talk of Rajasimhan as mamalla... iam not <br />  disputing <br />    the claim that bigtemple has been built by RRC. what is mean is <br />  that <br />    Kalki's hand is behind a lot of things behind RRc. RRC owes a <br />lot <br />  to <br />    Kalki</p>
<p>    5. Whether he built the temple for the massess is a question <br />next.<br />    had he really been intersted in people worshipping , i think as <br />a <br />    prudent ruler RRC wud have built lot of temples in his entire <br />land <br />    and not in tanjai alone.. as u said earlier he is a clear <br />egoist...</p>
<p>    6. Iam not an expert and i cannot deny that he allowed his <br />people <br />  to <br />    use his name .. but was that real??? u might recall the RRC <br />movie <br />    by sivaji ganesan wherein he was holding a spitton for a <br />    sthapathi... was itt rue?? </p>
<p>    Pls let me know whether the things as allowing somebody to use <br />the <br />    name and is proved beyond doubt when people still question the <br />    administration capability of Cholas???</p>
<p>    as rightly pointed out by Mr. Venkatesh, Pandyas as a race have <br />  been <br />    there for long.. cholas were so obsessed with madurai and lot of <br />    pattapeyars had madurantakan ... during wars the inscriptions of <br />    pandyas the great deeds of pandyas might have been ruined .... <br />and <br />    RRC since a recent king ( around 1000 years back) might be <br />    standing... just because one does not find a glorifying <br />  inscription <br />    of Pandya or say any other king for that matter , doesnt <br />denigrade <br />    the other Kings</p>
<p>    as u said earlier, lot of works are not comprehensive and before <br />    things are proved beyond a point i think the question " whether <br />  or <br />    not he deserves to be a egoist" till date has no answer.</p>
<p>    But one thing is absolutely clear .. He was at his best in <br />    Brandbuilding or Public Relations.. his PR agent in recent times <br />    being Kalki.</p>

<p>        enna solla vareenga... appadinaa RajaRajaChozhan was a <br />  vehement <br />        supporter of Caste based discrimination that he wanted <br />people <br />  of <br />        supposedly higher caste to serve him....</p>

<p>        Venkatesh sir::: your masterstroke "RajaRajaChozhan was the <br />    Biggest <br />        Egoist" is confirmed...<br />      =========================================<br />      WE ARE IN AGREEMENT THE MOMENT WE HEAR THE NAME "RAJA RAJA" - <br />@ -</p>
<p>      KING OF KINGS - THAT HE IS EGOIST! BUT NOT FOR NOTHING. <br />      HE DESERVES TO BE THE EGOIST.</p>
<p>      BUT RE-CASTE BASED COMMENTS, I THINK WE SHOULD EDUCATE <br />OURSELVES <br />      BETTER BEFORE COMING IN A FORUM.</p>
<p>      DIWAKAR WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WHO HEARD KUDAVOIL DR.BALU <br />    SAYING <br />      IN BIG TEMPLE COMPLEX :</p>
<p>      RAJARAJA was having love and affection on his sub-ordinates <br />and <br />      regarded their work and so permitted the Big Temple <br />Construction <br />      Enginner to be named after him as RAJARAJA PERUNTHACHAN !</p>
<p>      Same way, he permitted the use of the name RAJARAJA PERU <br />  NAAVITHAN <br />    to <br />      his Parlour specialist.</p>
<p>      We have already read of Vikrama Chozha Moovenda Velalar <br />changing <br />    his <br />      name as RAJARAJA MOOVENDA VELALAR!</p>
<p>      Anirudh's son named as Arumozhi Brahmadhirayar !</p>
<p>      These are enough that he recognised MERITS.</p>
<p>      We have fundamental rights to express, no doubt. </p>
<p>      But let us try to express Truth.</p>
<p>      Re Ego, he was Supreme as a King (of Kings).</p>
<p>      Look at the mix of King - Sivanadiyar Combo : there was <br />Seraman <br />      Perumal, RR's role model. Went alone to Kailasam.<br />      But RR brought Kailasam - Dakshina Meru - for everyone to <br />  worship <br />    in <br />      Thanjai!</p>
<p>      Reminds me of Tirukkottiyur Sri Ramanujar inviting everyone to <br />    learn <br />      the Manthra that would lead them to Vaikuntam inspite of <br />knowing <br />    he <br />      would attract the displeasure of his Guru :: It was him <br />reaching <br />      Vaikuntam alone Vs masses reaching Vaikuntam. Sri Ramanujar <br />  chose <br />      the masses.</p>
<p>      RR also chose the masses.</p>
<p>      He is the best as Rajarajan. </p>
<p>      He is the best as Sivapatha Sekaran!</p>
<p>      If he is not egoistic, we will consider him as a hypocritic.</p>

          RAJARAJA :: EGOIST ?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>The Great Raja Raja, was the King, who did expand the Tamil Dhesam <br />beyond boudaries and made is stand stable, for atleast next two <br />hundred years.</p>
<p>There might be man kings, who crossed north. Few are Pandian <br />Nediyon, Pandian palyaaga saalai Mudhukudumi peruvazhuthi, <br />Karikaalan Perumthirumaavalavan, Imayavaramban neduncheralathan, <br />Cheran Chenkoottuvan, Aariya padai kadantha paandian nedunchezian. </p>
<p>But Raja Raja, performed this act and gave stability, whihc may be <br />because of his administration tactics, which may have been followed <br />by his successors. As a gesture of respect there had been Three Raja <br />Raja in Chola lineage after him (there are Kulothunga and <br />Rajendhra's too).</p>
<p>He sponsered litrture and arts. 'Kottaattu Paattu', kottu aattu <br />paattu, percusion dance and singing (Music), was developed by him <br />very much, as Late Paramachaariar swamigal mentioned in <br />his 'Dheivathin Kural', when he speaks about Thiruotriyur.</p>
<p>Mohiniyaatam is belived to be developed by Raja Raja and have taken <br />refuge in Cheranaadu.</p>
<p>Not to mention about his interts in arts. after reading about group <br />mails in Tanjai painting.</p>
<p>Even if he is a egoist, there are innumerous attributes, that he <br />posses to feel so.</p>
<p>Rajendhra Cholan!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Sir,</p>
<p>  My points were just an observation of what Mr. sampath had mailed <br />  quoting a book written by somebody.. but i wud stil putforth <br />certain <br />  points.</p>
<p>  1. RajaRajaChozhan Yes was one of the greatest kings that <br />  tamizhagam ever produced.. but whether He is the King of Kings is <br />a <br />  point which needs to be deserved..... as u said earlier a concise <br />  work on the factual happennings are not yet recorded and a lot <br />needs <br />  to be discovered..Rajendra think is better than rajaraja in <br />  expanding the kingdom</p>
<p>  2. No iam not saying that a point which has not been discovered is <br />  not true.. what i mean is that it is a question of debate... </p>
<p>  3. My feeling is that there has been an aura of invincibility <br />  created around Rajaraja by people like Kalki and other writers <br />which <br />  we are following..</p>
<p>  4. Request you to kindly recollect the controversies surrounding <br />who <br />  the real mamalla is.. People thought it was Narasimhavarma <br />Pallavan <br />  I and now people talk of Rajasimhan as mamalla... iam not <br />disputing <br />  the claim that bigtemple has been built by RRC. what is mean is <br />that <br />  Kalki's hand is behind a lot of things behind RRc. RRC owes a lot <br />to <br />  Kalki</p>
<p>  5. Whether he built the temple for the massess is a question next.<br />  had he really been intersted in people worshipping , i think as a <br />  prudent ruler RRC wud have built lot of temples in his entire land <br />  and not in tanjai alone.. as u said earlier he is a clear egoist...</p>
<p>  6. Iam not an expert and i cannot deny that he allowed his people <br />to <br />  use his name .. but was that real??? u might recall the RRC movie <br />  by sivaji ganesan wherein he was holding a spitton for a <br />  sthapathi... was itt rue?? </p>
<p>  Pls let me know whether the things as allowing somebody to use the <br />  name and is proved beyond doubt when people still question the <br />  administration capability of Cholas???</p>
<p>  as rightly pointed out by Mr. Venkatesh, Pandyas as a race have <br />been <br />  there for long.. cholas were so obsessed with madurai and lot of <br />  pattapeyars had madurantakan ... during wars the inscriptions of <br />  pandyas the great deeds of pandyas might have been ruined .... and <br />  RRC since a recent king ( around 1000 years back) might be <br />  standing... just because one does not find a glorifying <br />inscription <br />  of Pandya or say any other king for that matter , doesnt denigrade <br />  the other Kings</p>
<p>  as u said earlier, lot of works are not comprehensive and before <br />  things are proved beyond a point i think the question " whether <br />or <br />  not he deserves to be a egoist" till date has no answer.</p>
<p>  But one thing is absolutely clear .. He was at his best in <br />  Brandbuilding or Public Relations.. his PR agent in recent times <br />  being Kalki.</p>

<p>      Venkatesh sir::: your masterstroke "RajaRajaChozhan was the <br />  Biggest <br />      Egoist" is confirmed...<br />    =========================================<br />    WE ARE IN AGREEMENT THE MOMENT WE HEAR THE NAME "RAJA RAJA" - @ -</p>
<p>    KING OF KINGS - THAT HE IS EGOIST! BUT NOT FOR NOTHING. <br />    HE DESERVES TO BE THE EGOIST.</p>
<p>    BUT RE-CASTE BASED COMMENTS, I THINK WE SHOULD EDUCATE OURSELVES <br />    BETTER BEFORE COMING IN A FORUM.</p>
<p>    DIWAKAR WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WHO HEARD KUDAVOIL DR.BALU <br />  SAYING <br />    IN BIG TEMPLE COMPLEX :</p>
<p>    RAJARAJA was having love and affection on his sub-ordinates and <br />    regarded their work and so permitted the Big Temple Construction <br />    Enginner to be named after him as RAJARAJA PERUNTHACHAN !</p>
<p>    Same way, he permitted the use of the name RAJARAJA PERU <br />NAAVITHAN <br />  to <br />    his Parlour specialist.</p>
<p>    We have already read of Vikrama Chozha Moovenda Velalar changing <br />  his <br />    name as RAJARAJA MOOVENDA VELALAR!</p>
<p>    Anirudh's son named as Arumozhi Brahmadhirayar !</p>
<p>    These are enough that he recognised MERITS.</p>
<p>    We have fundamental rights to express, no doubt. </p>
<p>    But let us try to express Truth.</p>
<p>    Re Ego, he was Supreme as a King (of Kings).</p>
<p>    Look at the mix of King - Sivanadiyar Combo : there was Seraman <br />    Perumal, RR's role model. Went alone to Kailasam.<br />    But RR brought Kailasam - Dakshina Meru - for everyone to <br />worship <br />  in <br />    Thanjai!</p>
<p>    Reminds me of Tirukkottiyur Sri Ramanujar inviting everyone to <br />  learn <br />    the Manthra that would lead them to Vaikuntam inspite of knowing <br />  he <br />    would attract the displeasure of his Guru :: It was him reaching <br />    Vaikuntam alone Vs masses reaching Vaikuntam. Sri Ramanujar <br />chose <br />    the masses.</p>
<p>    RR also chose the masses.</p>
<p>    He is the best as Rajarajan. </p>
<p>    He is the best as Sivapatha Sekaran!</p>
<p>    If he is not egoistic, we will consider him as a hypocritic.</p>
