<p>Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>I am surprised you are also using "Sir". Please Sir, do not call me <br />Sir, Sir. (Lighter .. )</p>
<p>I was mentioning that we are taught the History written by the <br />British in our Schools.</p>
<p>In our curriculam, We read HISTORY as one of the subjects. During my <br />school days it was from 6th 12th I remember. The subjects were <br />mainly on Maurias, Guptas, Kalingas, Krishnadeva Rayas and so on. As <br />far South Indian History, very much in General of Moovendar Rule. Re <br />Independece, Palaykkarar unrest is hardly mentioned. Where as 1842 <br />Sippaikalagam ( There was Tamil medium education in my village High <br />School) was given prominence. Bombay - Thane Rail lines .. <br />Gopalakrishna Gokale, Balagangathara Thilak &amp; so on.. My children are <br />also studying the same materials only. </p>
<p>I do not see any new inputs in their syllabus after 30 yrs.</p>
<p>Where as World Tamil conference are being conducted, new papers are <br />submitted, we are discussing extensively, Tamil/ History Scholars are <br />putting forth interesting theories, <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  is coming out fresh evidences <br />on ancient Tamil culture - History related .. </acronym></p>
<p>BUT DOES ANYTHING FIND ITS WAY TO THE SCHOOL BOOKS - WHICH IS THE <br />MAIN SOURCE OF LEARNING / EDUACTING ?</p>
<p>That was spelt out .. We have to search for History .. <br />Ponniyinselvan appears to be the common factor for such persons with <br />thirst ..</p>

<p>the scindias of gwalior were all powerful</p>
<p>one should read khuswant sings "delhi"<br />he describes the siege and fall of delhi from the eyes of a sikh <br />soldier.how the soldiers rejoice the fall of the city where their <br />guru's were killed.</p>

<p>  many of ur icons are false gods.For example janshi rani laxmi <br />bhai.She<br />  is hailed as something great,but she never had any dream for<br />  independent india or independent jhansi state.Her reason for joining<br />  the sepoy mutiny was that british refused to accept her adopted son <br />as<br />  king.She was about to lose her province anyway.So she joined mutiny <br />in<br />  1857.Had british allowed her adopted son to rule the kingdom,she <br />would<br />  not have joined the mutiny.</p>
<p>  In many ways we should thank god that 1857 mutiny failed.had it<br />  succeeded now jhansi,ayodhya,bengal,punjab etc would have been <br />  seperate countries.we would have had 1000 countries in place of<br />  India.To go from arcot to pudukottai we would have needed passport<br />  and visa.Maybe we would have become a federation in the euro model <br />but<br />  chances for that is very,very less.</p>
<p>  A country needs heroes.Unfortunately in our country we have very few<br />  'all india level heroes'.Gandhi,Nehru,nethaji,...the list becomes <br />very<br />  thin after these 3 names.</p>
<p>  Leaders like kamarajar,muthuramalinga thevar,VOC,ambethkar,marshall<br />  nesamani ponnaya,rajaji have become icons for their respective<br />  castes.Periyar,veer savarkar,indira,baktavatsalam etc have become<br />  icons only for their parties.Tippu sultan and satrapathi shivaji are<br />  hailed only by specific religions.Depending on which party comes to<br />  power these icons are either hailed or degraded.</p>
<p>  Even kings of past are hailed as icons of their community.This makes<br />  other castes to immediatly detest the kings.Our politicians also<br />  played a major role in this.Theeran chinnamalai became theeran<br />  chiinamalai gounder,king alagumuthu became alagumuthu kon and we <br />even<br />  had sambuvarayar mavattam before some time.</p>

<p>    he has hit the nail on its head</p>
<p>    we as students of history should realise there was no entity <br />called <br />    india till just before the british left.<br />    and the indianness started with 1857.</p>
<p>    kattabomman and maruthu pandyar were feudatories of the arcot <br />nawab a <br />    remnant of the mughal empire. when arcot transferred its powers <br />to <br />    the british rose these problems.</p>
<p>    i distinctly remember having read that kattabomman visited fort <br />st <br />    george as a valued guest of the british a few years before he <br />turned <br />    rebel.</p>
<p>      Was kattabomman popular before the movie came?Or was he raised <br />to <br />    cult<br />      status because of the movie?was he a real freedom fighter or a <br />local<br />      king who lost the game with ettayapuram raja?</p>
<p>    kattabomman and the ettappaa business must be after independence <br />when <br />    we were hunting for heroes.</p>
<p>    perhaps Bharathiyar would never have been in the employ of the <br />    ettayapuram if he had beleived it had betrayed kattabomman.(????)</p>
<p>    regards<br />    venketesh</p>
<p>      I find it difficult to accept pre 1857 kings as freedom <br />    fighters.They<br />      never had any dreams of indian indpendence.They wanted to rule <br />their<br />      province independently and dint give a damn when other indian <br />kings<br />      were attacked.Tippu opposed british when they attacked him but <br />kept<br />      quiet when marathas and other kings were defeated by british.</p>
<p>      British were very much an indian kingdom then.Other kings saw <br />them <br />    as<br />      another indian kingdom and frequently entered into agreements <br />and<br />      friendships with them.Those who fought with british were later <br />on<br />      raised to cult status.</p>
<p>      In reality no king thought beyond his samasthanam.1857 was first<br />      attempt to chase away british from whole of india.</p>

<p>        some info I gathered on kattabomman- the man</p>
<p>        Paanchalankurichi is a hamlet 18 kms from Thoothukkudi. It <br />was <br />    here <br />        that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi was <br />born on <br />        January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and <br />Aarmugathammal. <br />        The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who was a <br />    minister <br />        in King Jagaveera Pandian's durbar in Azhagiya <br />Veerapandiapuram, <br />    as <br />        Ottapidaram of today was known as. <br />        Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated from the <br />        Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and was a <br />    fearless <br />        warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died issueless, <br />Bommu <br />        ascended the throne. <br />        Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on February <br />7, <br />    1790, <br />        and ruled for 9 years<br />        The TN Government has propagated the memory of Kattabomman by <br />        erecting (in 1974) a memorial fort in his honour in <br />        Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the hereditary <br />    Goddess <br />        of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.</p>
<p>        To observe the bicentenary on 16th October 1999 of <br />Kattabomman's <br />        hanging, the Central Government brought out a postal stamp in <br />his <br />        honour.</p>
<p>        there are seven living direct descendents of the Kattabomman <br />        family.The Government pays each of them a monthly pension of <br />Rs. <br />    500,</p>
<p>        Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the nine Nava <br />        Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt between <br />    Thirunelveli <br />        and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple witnessed <br />the <br />        battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and the <br />    British, <br />        where the British used this temple as a fortress. Battle <br />marks <br />    are <br />        seen on the temple's door. </p>

<p>Dear Sampath,</p>
<p>The informations are not all known / read widely. Depressing indeed.</p>
<p>Too big a task to be handled by small group like that of ours .. <br />However as you are rightly doing, we can continue to crate more <br />awareness on authetic details.</p>

        <p>-Dear Sri</p>
<p>freedom at midnight was the book that changed my outlook on gandhi.I <br />read it in school.</p>
<p>to me he changed from a whimsical and weak leader into a man with <br />mammoth intellect.one who could match machivelli for every move.<br />he was not weak I realised but acting so.( when he spurned violence)</p>
<p>words like " he humbled the empire with a glass of water and <br />bicarbonate of soda( gandhi used to take this during his fasts)<br />still are fresh in my mind.</p>

<p>    many of ur icons are false gods.For example janshi rani laxmi <br />  bhai.She<br />    is hailed as something great,but she never had any dream for<br />    independent india or independent jhansi state.Her reason for <br />joining<br />    the sepoy mutiny was that british refused to accept her adopted <br />son <br />  as<br />    king.She was about to lose her province anyway.So she joined <br />mutiny <br />  in<br />    1857.Had british allowed her adopted son to rule the kingdom,she <br />  would<br />    not have joined the mutiny.</p>
<p>    In many ways we should thank god that 1857 mutiny failed.had it<br />    succeeded now jhansi,ayodhya,bengal,punjab etc would have been <br />    seperate countries.we would have had 1000 countries in place of<br />    India.To go from arcot to pudukottai we would have needed <br />passport<br />    and visa.Maybe we would have become a federation in the euro <br />model <br />  but<br />    chances for that is very,very less.</p>
<p>    A country needs heroes.Unfortunately in our country we have very <br />few<br />    'all india level heroes'.Gandhi,Nehru,nethaji,...the list becomes <br />  very<br />    thin after these 3 names.</p>
<p>    Leaders like kamarajar,muthuramalinga <br />thevar,VOC,ambethkar,marshall<br />    nesamani ponnaya,rajaji have become icons for their respective<br />    castes.Periyar,veer savarkar,indira,baktavatsalam etc have become<br />    icons only for their parties.Tippu sultan and satrapathi shivaji <br />are<br />    hailed only by specific religions.Depending on which party comes <br />to<br />    power these icons are either hailed or degraded.</p>
<p>    Even kings of past are hailed as icons of their community.This <br />makes<br />    other castes to immediatly detest the kings.Our politicians also<br />    played a major role in this.Theeran chinnamalai became theeran<br />    chiinamalai gounder,king alagumuthu became alagumuthu kon and we <br />  even<br />    had sambuvarayar mavattam before some time.</p>

<p>      he has hit the nail on its head</p>
<p>      we as students of history should realise there was no entity <br />  called <br />      india till just before the british left.<br />      and the indianness started with 1857.</p>
<p>      kattabomman and maruthu pandyar were feudatories of the arcot <br />  nawab a <br />      remnant of the mughal empire. when arcot transferred its powers <br />  to <br />      the british rose these problems.</p>
<p>      i distinctly remember having read that kattabomman visited fort <br />  st <br />      george as a valued guest of the british a few years before he <br />  turned <br />      rebel.</p>
<p>        Was kattabomman popular before the movie came?Or was he <br />raised <br />  to <br />      cult<br />        status because of the movie?was he a real freedom fighter or <br />a <br />  local<br />        king who lost the game with ettayapuram raja?</p>
<p>      kattabomman and the ettappaa business must be after <br />independence <br />  when <br />      we were hunting for heroes.</p>
<p>      perhaps Bharathiyar would never have been in the employ of the <br />      ettayapuram if he had beleived it had betrayed kattabomman.<br />(????)</p>
<p>      regards<br />      venketesh</p>
<p>        I find it difficult to accept pre 1857 kings as freedom <br />      fighters.They<br />        never had any dreams of indian indpendence.They wanted to <br />rule <br />  their<br />        province independently and dint give a damn when other indian <br />  kings<br />        were attacked.Tippu opposed british when they attacked him <br />but <br />  kept<br />        quiet when marathas and other kings were defeated by british.</p>
<p>        British were very much an indian kingdom then.Other kings saw <br />  them <br />      as<br />        another indian kingdom and frequently entered into agreements <br />  and<br />        friendships with them.Those who fought with british were <br />later <br />  on<br />        raised to cult status.</p>
<p>        In reality no king thought beyond his samasthanam.1857 was <br />first<br />        attempt to chase away british from whole of india.</p>

<p>          some info I gathered on kattabomman- the man</p>
<p>          Paanchalankurichi is a hamlet 18 kms from Thoothukkudi. It <br />  was <br />      here <br />          that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi was <br />  born on <br />          January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and <br />  Aarmugathammal. <br />          The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who was a <br />      minister <br />          in King Jagaveera Pandian's durbar in Azhagiya <br />  Veerapandiapuram, <br />      as <br />          Ottapidaram of today was known as. <br />          Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated from <br />the <br />          Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and was <br />a <br />      fearless <br />          warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died issueless, <br />  Bommu <br />          ascended the throne. <br />          Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on <br />February <br />  7, <br />      1790, <br />          and ruled for 9 years<br />          The TN Government has propagated the memory of Kattabomman <br />by <br />          erecting (in 1974) a memorial fort in his honour in <br />          Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the <br />hereditary <br />      Goddess <br />          of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.</p>
<p>          To observe the bicentenary on 16th October 1999 of <br />  Kattabomman's <br />          hanging, the Central Government brought out a postal stamp <br />in <br />  his <br />          honour.</p>
<p>          there are seven living direct descendents of the <br />Kattabomman <br />          family.The Government pays each of them a monthly pension <br />of <br />  Rs. <br />      500,</p>
<p>          Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the nine <br />Nava <br />          Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt between <br />      Thirunelveli <br />          and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple <br />witnessed <br />  the <br />          battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and the <br />      British, <br />          where the British used this temple as a fortress. Battle <br />  marks <br />      are <br />          seen on the temple's door. </p>

<p>  In many ways we should thank god that 1857 mutiny failed.had it<br />  succeeded now jhansi,ayodhya,bengal,punjab etc would have been <br />  seperate countries.we would have had 1000 countries in place of<br />  India.To go from arcot to pudukottai we would have needed passport<br />  and visa.Maybe we would have become a federation in the euro model <br />but<br />  chances for that is very,very less.</p>

<p>    he has hit the nail on its head</p>
<p>    we as students of history should realise there was no entity <br />called <br />    india till just before the british left.<br />    and the indianness started with 1857.</p>
<p>    kattabomman and maruthu pandyar were feudatories of the arcot <br />nawab a <br />    remnant of the mughal empire. when arcot transferred its powers <br />to <br />    the british rose these problems.</p>
<p>    i distinctly remember having read that kattabomman visited fort <br />st <br />    george as a valued guest of the british a few years before he <br />turned <br />    rebel.</p>
<p>      Was kattabomman popular before the movie came?Or was he raised <br />to <br />    cult<br />      status because of the movie?was he a real freedom fighter or a <br />local<br />      king who lost the game with ettayapuram raja?</p>
<p>    kattabomman and the ettappaa business must be after independence <br />when <br />    we were hunting for heroes.</p>
<p>    perhaps Bharathiyar would never have been in the employ of the <br />    ettayapuram if he had beleived it had betrayed kattabomman.(????)</p>
<p>    regards<br />    venketesh</p>
<p>      I find it difficult to accept pre 1857 kings as freedom <br />    fighters.They<br />      never had any dreams of indian indpendence.They wanted to rule <br />their<br />      province independently and dint give a damn when other indian <br />kings<br />      were attacked.Tippu opposed british when they attacked him but <br />kept<br />      quiet when marathas and other kings were defeated by british.</p>
<p>      British were very much an indian kingdom then.Other kings saw <br />them <br />    as<br />      another indian kingdom and frequently entered into agreements <br />and<br />      friendships with them.Those who fought with british were later <br />on<br />      raised to cult status.</p>
<p>      In reality no king thought beyond his samasthanam.1857 was first<br />      attempt to chase away british from whole of india.</p>

<p>        some info I gathered on kattabomman- the man</p>
<p>        Paanchalankurichi is a hamlet 18 kms from Thoothukkudi. It <br />was <br />    here <br />        that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi was <br />born on <br />        January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and <br />Aarmugathammal. <br />        The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who was a <br />    minister <br />        in King Jagaveera Pandian's durbar in Azhagiya <br />Veerapandiapuram, <br />    as <br />        Ottapidaram of today was known as. <br />        Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated from the <br />        Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and was a <br />    fearless <br />        warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died issueless, <br />Bommu <br />        ascended the throne. <br />        Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on February <br />7, <br />    1790, <br />        and ruled for 9 years<br />        The TN Government has propagated the memory of Kattabomman by <br />        erecting (in 1974) a memorial fort in his honour in <br />        Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the hereditary <br />    Goddess <br />        of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.</p>
<p>        To observe the bicentenary on 16th October 1999 of <br />Kattabomman's <br />        hanging, the Central Government brought out a postal stamp in <br />his <br />        honour.</p>
<p>        there are seven living direct descendents of the Kattabomman <br />        family.The Government pays each of them a monthly pension of <br />Rs. <br />    500,</p>
<p>        Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the nine Nava <br />        Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt between <br />    Thirunelveli <br />        and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple witnessed <br />the <br />        battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and the <br />    British, <br />        where the British used this temple as a fortress. Battle <br />marks <br />    are <br />        seen on the temple's door. </p>

          INDIAN HISTORY :: SOUTH INDIAN - IN PARTICULAR        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Venkatesh,</p>
<p>many of ur icons are false gods.For example janshi rani laxmi bhai.She<br />is hailed as something great,but she never had any dream for<br />independent india or independent jhansi state.Her reason for joining<br />the sepoy mutiny was that british refused to accept her adopted son as<br />king.She was about to lose her province anyway.So she joined mutiny in<br />1857.Had british allowed her adopted son to rule the kingdom,she would<br />not have joined the mutiny.</p>
<p>In many ways we should thank god that 1857 mutiny failed.had it<br />succeeded now jhansi,ayodhya,bengal,punjab etc would have been <br />seperate countries.we would have had 1000 countries in place of<br />India.To go from arcot to pudukottai we would have needed passport<br />and visa.Maybe we would have become a federation in the euro model but<br />chances for that is very,very less.</p>
<p>A country needs heroes.Unfortunately in our country we have very few<br />'all india level heroes'.Gandhi,Nehru,nethaji,...the list becomes very<br />thin after these 3 names.</p>
<p>Leaders like kamarajar,muthuramalinga thevar,VOC,ambethkar,marshall<br />nesamani ponnaya,rajaji have become icons for their respective<br />castes.Periyar,veer savarkar,indira,baktavatsalam etc have become<br />icons only for their parties.Tippu sultan and satrapathi shivaji are<br />hailed only by specific religions.Depending on which party comes to<br />power these icons are either hailed or degraded.</p>
<p>Even kings of past are hailed as icons of their community.This makes<br />other castes to immediatly detest the kings.Our politicians also<br />played a major role in this.Theeran chinnamalai became theeran<br />chiinamalai gounder,king alagumuthu became alagumuthu kon and we even<br />had sambuvarayar mavattam before some time.</p>

<blockquote><p>  sampaththukku oru salaaam</p>
<p>  he has hit the nail on its head</p>
<p>  we as students of history should realise there was no entity called <br />  india till just before the british left.<br />  and the indianness started with 1857.</p>
<p>  kattabomman and maruthu pandyar were feudatories of the arcot nawab a <br />  remnant of the mughal empire. when arcot transferred its powers to <br />  the british rose these problems.</p>
<p>  i distinctly remember having read that kattabomman visited fort st <br />  george as a valued guest of the british a few years before he turned <br />  rebel.</p>
<p>    Was kattabomman popular before the movie came?Or was he raised to <br />  cult<br />    status because of the movie?was he a real freedom fighter or a local<br />    king who lost the game with ettayapuram raja?</p>
<p>  kattabomman and the ettappaa business must be after independence when <br />  we were hunting for heroes.</p>
<p>  perhaps Bharathiyar would never have been in the employ of the <br />  ettayapuram if he had beleived it had betrayed kattabomman.(????)</p>
<p>  regards<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    I find it difficult to accept pre 1857 kings as freedom <br />  fighters.They<br />    never had any dreams of indian indpendence.They wanted to rule their<br />    province independently and dint give a damn when other indian kings<br />    were attacked.Tippu opposed british when they attacked him but kept<br />    quiet when marathas and other kings were defeated by british.</p>
<p>    British were very much an indian kingdom then.Other kings saw them <br />  as<br />    another indian kingdom and frequently entered into agreements and<br />    friendships with them.Those who fought with british were later on<br />    raised to cult status.</p>
<p>    In reality no king thought beyond his samasthanam.1857 was first<br />    attempt to chase away british from whole of india.</p>

<p>      some info I gathered on kattabomman- the man</p>
<p>      Paanchalankurichi is a hamlet 18 kms from Thoothukkudi. It was <br />  here <br />      that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi was born on <br />      January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and Aarmugathammal. <br />      The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who was a <br />  minister <br />      in King Jagaveera Pandian's durbar in Azhagiya Veerapandiapuram, <br />  as <br />      Ottapidaram of today was known as. <br />      Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated from the <br />      Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and was a <br />  fearless <br />      warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died issueless, Bommu <br />      ascended the throne. <br />      Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on February 7, <br />  1790, <br />      and ruled for 9 years<br />      The TN Government has propagated the memory of Kattabomman by <br />      erecting (in 1974) a memorial fort in his honour in <br />      Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the hereditary <br />  Goddess <br />      of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.</p>
<p>      To observe the bicentenary on 16th October 1999 of Kattabomman's <br />      hanging, the Central Government brought out a postal stamp in his <br />      honour.</p>
<p>      there are seven living direct descendents of the Kattabomman <br />      family.The Government pays each of them a monthly pension of Rs. <br />  500,</p>
<p>      Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the nine Nava <br />      Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt between <br />  Thirunelveli <br />      and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple witnessed the <br />      battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and the <br />  British, <br />      where the British used this temple as a fortress. Battle marks <br />  are <br />      seen on the temple's door. </p>
<p>      regards<br />      venketesh</p>

          INDIAN HISTORY :: SOUTH INDIAN - IN PARTICULAR        </div>

<p>he has hit the nail on its head</p>
<p>we as students of history should realise there was no entity called <br />india till just before the british left.<br />and the indianness started with 1857.</p>
<p>kattabomman and maruthu pandyar were feudatories of the arcot nawab a <br />remnant of the mughal empire. when arcot transferred its powers to <br />the british rose these problems.</p>
<p>i distinctly remember having read that kattabomman visited fort st <br />george as a valued guest of the british a few years before he turned <br />rebel.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Was kattabomman popular before the movie came?Or was he raised to <br />cult<br />  status because of the movie?was he a real freedom fighter or a local<br />  king who lost the game with ettayapuram raja?</p></blockquote>
<p>kattabomman and the ettappaa business must be after independence when <br />we were hunting for heroes.</p>
<p>perhaps Bharathiyar would never have been in the employ of the <br />ettayapuram if he had beleived it had betrayed kattabomman.(????)</p>
<p>regards<br />venketesh</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  I find it difficult to accept pre 1857 kings as freedom <br />fighters.They<br />  never had any dreams of indian indpendence.They wanted to rule their<br />  province independently and dint give a damn when other indian kings<br />  were attacked.Tippu opposed british when they attacked him but kept<br />  quiet when marathas and other kings were defeated by british.</p>
<p>  British were very much an indian kingdom then.Other kings saw them <br />as<br />  another indian kingdom and frequently entered into agreements and<br />  friendships with them.Those who fought with british were later on<br />  raised to cult status.</p>
<p>  In reality no king thought beyond his samasthanam.1857 was first<br />  attempt to chase away british from whole of india.</p>

        <p>We went to Ettayapuram thinking that we would get to<br />see Bharathiyar's house in all its glory ( I dont mean<br />richness..... I mean well preserved, respected and<br />valued). Unfortunately, the guy who is supposed to<br />come and open did not come beyond the appointed time.<br />We made 3 repeated trips on the same day, but still it<br />was not open. Compare this with the way Shakespeare's<br />house is treated in England!!</p>
<p>Why are we like this??? The neighbour of this great<br />house, where a man like Bharathiyar lived, does not<br />want to even open his house to answer our questions.<br />He is happy watching a stupid serial in Sun TV when a<br />group of us want some information from him as to the<br />timings of the place... this house has been taken over<br />by Govt and it employs a man to show it around. Still,<br />this is the condition!</p>
<p>Yes, I know Sivagangai Samasthanam has no connection<br />with Marudhu Pandiyar. But they had access to a lot of<br />valuable historical data which they did not really<br />value! Their tutor had read almost all of them and<br />knew more about Marudhu Pandyas!!</p>

<blockquote><p>  I am from Sivagangai. My grandfather, who had<br />tutored<br />  3 generations of the Rajas of Sivagangai was the<br />  source of information for Kannadasan. I have heard<br />  from my grandmother that whenever Kannadasan came to<br />  our house to learn and discuss historical matters<br />with<br />  him, the womenfolk of the house and street used to<br />  sort of go away, as he was a "nasthik" at that time<br />  and used to write on women in a not so dignified<br />way..<br />  at that time. So, many people told my thatha not to<br />  co-operate with him, as he may not put the things in<br />  the right perspective. Still, my thatha liked<br />working<br />  with him, understanding his genuine feeling for<br />  Marudhu Pandiyar and they had worked together for<br />days<br />  on.</p>
<p>  Of course, no acknowledgement was made anywhere in<br />the<br />  movie for all the help rendered is another thing<br />which<br />  we Indians are used to.</p>
<p>  In fact, Kaviyogi Maharshi Suddhanandha Bharathi had<br />  written a full-fledged drama on Marudhu<br />Sahodharargal,<br />  which is full of actual facts dramatised very well.</p>
<p>  The present family members of Sivaganga Samasthanam<br />  are associated with Suddhananda Bharathiyar's school<br />  at Cholapuram, near Sivagangai. </p>

<p>  Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the nine Nava <br />  Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt between Thirunelveli <br />  and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple witnessed the <br />  battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and the British, <br />  where the British used this temple as a fortress. Battle marks are <br />  seen on the temple's door. </p>

        <p>Dear uma<br />the present sivaganga royal family has not descended from the maruthu <br />brothers. their descendants live in an area called aranmanai <br />siruvayal.<br />they are still honoured on the ther thiruvizha of kalayar koil every <br />may month</p>
<p>kattabomman had no great conquest except occasional raids into <br />ettayapuram zamin<br />whereas maruthu sakotharakal even held madurai for some time.</p>
<p>but all said and done kattabomman was a brave warrior who defended <br />his rights against an alien.<br />and ettayapuram which was reportedly responsible for his death <br />repented in a great way??????<br />know what????</p>
<p>subramania bharathi was born there. </p>

I have heard<br />  from my grandmother that whenever Kannadasan came to<br />  our house to learn and discuss historical matters with<br />  him, the womenfolk of the house and street used to<br />  sort of go away, as he was a "nasthik" at that time<br />  and used to write on women in a not so dignified way..<br />  at that time. So, many people told my thatha not to<br />  co-operate with him, as he may not put the things in<br />  the right perspective. Still, my thatha liked working<br />  with him, understanding his genuine feeling for<br />  Marudhu Pandiyar and they had worked together for days<br />  on.</p>
<p>  Of course, no acknowledgement was made anywhere in the<br />  movie for all the help rendered is another thing which<br />  we Indians are used to.</p>
<p>  In fact, Kaviyogi Maharshi Suddhanandha Bharathi had<br />  written a full-fledged drama on Marudhu Sahodharargal,<br />  which is full of actual facts dramatised very well.</p>

        <p>Panchalankurichi is visited mostly by school children<br />where they can see paintings ( recent) depicting life<br />of Kattabomman. There is a watchman who takes you<br />around the painting repeating what is written there in<br />Tamil and asks you for money at the end of the trip.</p>
<p>Just outside, there is temple of Jakkamma and ruins of<br />the palace of Kattabomman. One interesting thing about<br />the place is, there is a spot which is very cool even<br />in the hot afternoon of May ( when we were there).<br />This is open to sky, but the stone is very cool. You<br />can feel it with your bare foot. The next stone is<br />very hot. This one is absolutely chill.....</p>
<p>A person who claimed that he is descendent of<br />Kattabomman ( he had the relevant document issued by<br />Govt.) tells you stories of Kattabomman and told us<br />about this stone which was part of the Andhapuram,<br />which was sort of air-coolled. This guy has got a lot<br />of rare issues of history based books which God knows<br />he procured from where. </p>
<p>Sad part is, at the end of the discussion, he<br />literally begs you for money. You are left with a<br />mixed feeling of .............</p>

<p>---------------------------------<br />Dear Sri</p>
<p>some info I gathered on kattabomman- the man</p>
<p>Paanchalankurichi is a hamlet 18 kms from<br />Thoothukkudi. It was here <br />that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi<br />was born on <br />January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and<br />Aarmugathammal. <br />The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who<br />was a minister <br />in King Jagaveera Pandian's durbar in Azhagiya<br />Veerapandiapuram, as <br />Ottapidaram of today was known as. <br />Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated<br />from the <br />Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and<br />was a fearless <br />warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died<br />issueless, Bommu <br />ascended the throne. <br />Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on<br />February 7, 1790, <br />and ruled for 9 years<br />The TN Government has propagated the memory of<br />Kattabomman by <br />erecting (in 1974) a memorial fort in his honour in <br />Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the<br />hereditary Goddess <br />of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.</p>
<p>To observe the bicentenary on 16th October 1999 of<br />Kattabomman's <br />hanging, the Central Government brought out a postal<br />stamp in his <br />honour.</p>
<p>there are seven living direct descendents of the<br />Kattabomman <br />family.The Government pays each of them a monthly<br />pension of Rs. 500,</p>
<p>Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the<br />nine Nava <br />Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt<br />between Thirunelveli <br />and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple<br />witnessed the <br />battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and<br />the British, <br />where the British used this temple as a fortress.<br />Battle marks are <br />seen on the temple's door. </p>

        <p>Dear Sri</p>
<p>kattabomman the movie and sivagangai seemai</p>
<p>the film kattabomman was not without its share of controversies.<br />Denouncing the glorification of Kattabomman, Thamizhvaanan <br />wrote "kattabomman telungan! koLLaikkaran! avanukku munbE pulithEvan <br />engiRa veera maRavan pOraadinaan!"<br />Kannadasan claimed that the Maruthu brothers were the true sons of <br />the soil who raised their voice against the British. And to bolster <br />his claim, he set about making the movie `sivagangai seemai'. <br />veerapaNdiya kattabomman was released on May 6, 1959, and sivagangai <br />seemai was released on May 19, 1959.<br />Kannadasan Productions' Sivagangai Seemai- 1959 was Kannadasan's <br />labour of love, He wrote the script & lyrics; and produced the film. <br />It was his second venture in the wake of the success of Maalaiyitta <br />Mangai the previous year. Sivagangai Seemai was directed by <br />K.Shankar, and had a talented star cast led by T.K.Bagavathi, SSR, <br />P.S.Veerappa, S.Varalakshmi, Kumari Kamala, M.N.Rajam and others. <br />Unfortunately for Kannadasan, Sivagangai Seemai was consigned back <br />to the cans within no time of its release while the successful <br />Veerapandiya Kattabomman was acclaimed as a magnum opus. Kannadasan <br />ended up with a huge financial loss. <br />Sivagangai Seemai still remains among the best historical films made <br />in Tamil. Kannadasan's native soil was the canvas, and he was <br />familiar with its history and geography. He had a keen sense of the <br />period, and his passion ensured that Sivagangai Seemai was much more <br />than a commonplace costume drama. </p>

        <p>Dear Sri</p>
<p>some info I gathered on kattabomman- the man</p>
<p>Paanchalankurichi is a hamlet 18 kms from Thoothukkudi. It was here <br />that Veerapandian, the 47th king of Paanchalankurichi was born on <br />January 3rd, 1760 to Jagaveera Kattabomman and Aarmugathammal. <br />The Kattabommans traced their ancestry to Bommu, who was a minister <br />in King Jagaveera Pandian's durbar in Azhagiya Veerapandiapuram, as <br />Ottapidaram of today was known as. <br />Bommu, or Gettibommu was he was called, had migrated from the <br />Vijayanagar region of what is Andhra Pradesh today and was a fearless <br />warrior as well. After Jagaveera Pandiyan died issueless, Bommu <br />ascended the throne. <br />Veerapandian became the king of Panchalankurichi on February 7, 1790, <br />and ruled for 9 years<br />The TN Government has propagated the memory of Kattabomman by <br />erecting (in 1974) a memorial fort in his honour in <br />Paanchalankurichi. Sri Devi Jakkammal Temple, the hereditary Goddess <br />of Kattabomman, is located near the fort.</p>
<p>To observe the bicentenary on 16th October 1999 of Kattabomman's <br />hanging, the Central Government brought out a postal stamp in his <br />honour.</p>
<p>there are seven living direct descendents of the Kattabomman <br />family.The Government pays each of them a monthly pension of Rs. 500,</p>
<p>Sree Vaikuntham which constitutes the first of the nine Nava <br />Thiruppatis in Thirunelveli district in the belt between Thirunelveli <br />and the coastal shrine of Thiruchendur. This temple witnessed the <br />battle between the valiant Veerapandya Kattabomman and the British, <br />where the British used this temple as a fortress. Battle marks are <br />seen on the temple's door. </p>

        <p>Dear Sri</p>
<p>the kattabomman legend was started by the theru koothu movement and <br />came into the drama companies ahead of the dmk movement</p>
<p>but making a pakka telugu speak the most remembered tamil vasanam of <br />the century was an achievement- dont you think so.</p>
<p>if you exclude the telugu contributions tamilnadu will have very <br />little.</p>
<p>some of our greatest temples were built( or rebuilt) during naik <br />period.most of our feudal kings of the previous centuries were telugu.</p>
<p>but it was kannadasan who felt kattabomman had been blown out of <br />proportion and tried to bring into light the achievements of the <br />marudu brothers whose opposition to the british was on a much larger <br />scale.</p>

<blockquote><p>  once when he had gone on a holiday it was his minister who sparked <br />  off the conflict with the british.<br />  anyway kattabommans real name was katta bommu and most of his court <br />  dealings were in telugu.<br />  so nathu nattayaa kalai pariththaayaa , manjchal araithaaya was a <br />  vasanam with remote chances of having ever been spoken.</p>
<p>  but talk about kattabomman and we remember this vasanam. so in many <br />  if not most places history is often about what a majority wants to <br />  hear and not the real truth.</p>
<p>  ( i think thamil vanan wrote a book called kattabomman kollaikaaran)</p>
<p>  regards<br />  venketesh<br />=============================</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr Jaybee wrote of Marudhu's gs working for the British in the <br />East .. in Agathiyar Group.</p>
<p>He also wrote with concern : History is NOT as romantic as you people <br />think ...</p>
<p>All the Scholars share this concern .. <br />But Literature has its liberties.. <br />Kalki is much better. </p>
<p>His caution is visible from the fact that he chose to write on <br />Arumozhi - which period is not supported of any inscriptional <br />evidence on Arumozhi .. And though he portraited of several villages <br />and towns, never uttered a word of udayarkudi !</p>
<p>And see how he has named the Story / Novel / magnum opus ::</p>

          INDIAN HISTORY :: SOUTH INDIAN - IN PARTICULAR        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>dear kamal<br />most of the info on kattabomman was obtained from the walls of the <br />memorial in panchalan kurichi.</p>
<p>and another thing Kamal, just dont imagine the actual scenario by <br />watching the movie v.p.kattabomman. <br />you will be in for a shock when you see actual panchalangkurichi.<br />I took my son there once and was shocked at the small size</p>
<p>his comment was " enna appa fort is smaller than my school"</p>
<p>and there was some truth in it.the movie had been done with a <br />truckload of imagination.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>
<p>and know what ? the movie kattabomman was never screened in <br />ettayapuram. ( the major town next to panchalangkurichi)<br />because the only theatre there was owned by the rajah of ettayapuram <br />whose anscestors were portrayed as villians in the movie.</p>

<p>    I was mentioning that we are taught the History written by the <br />    British in our Schools.</p>
<p>    In our curriculam, We read HISTORY as one of the subjects. During <br />  my <br />    school days it was from 6th 12th I remember.

<p>    I do not see any new inputs in their syllabus after 30 yrs.</p>
<p>    Where as World Tamil conference are being conducted, new papers are <br />    submitted, we are discussing extensively, Tamil/ History Scholars <br />  are <br />    putting forth interesting theories, ASI is coming out fresh <br />  evidences <br />    on ancient Tamil culture - History related .. </p>
<p>    BUT DOES ANYTHING FIND ITS WAY TO THE SCHOOL BOOKS - WHICH IS THE <br />    MAIN SOURCE OF LEARNING / EDUACTING ?</p>

        <p>literature is a two edged sword.</p>
<p>as you said ponniyin selvan spurred on an interest in tamil history</p>
<p>but then writers do get carried away sometimes.<br />one classic case is veerapandiya kattabomman.</p>
<p>veerapandiya kattabomman was one who paid his taxes promptly. he had <br />even visited madras as a guest of the british and stayed in the fort <br />st george.</p>
<p>once when he had gone on a holiday it was his minister who sparked <br />off the conflict with the british.<br />anyway kattabommans real name was katta bommu and most of his court <br />dealings were in telugu.<br />so nathu nattayaa kalai pariththaayaa , manjchal araithaaya was a <br />vasanam with remote chances of having ever been spoken.</p>
<p>but talk about kattabomman and we remember this vasanam. so in many <br />if not most places history is often about what a majority wants to <br />hear and not the real truth.</p>
