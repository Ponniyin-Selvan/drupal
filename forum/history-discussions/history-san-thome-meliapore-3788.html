<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Thomas_of_Mylapur" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Thomas_of_Mylapur">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Thomas_of_Mylapur</a></p>
<p>Christianity in India from 68AD. This is an interesting article on the legend of St.Thomas church.. Looks like there has been violence against other religions even during the reign of pallavas, are there any documentary evidiences in this regards. This article also mentions that there was a tsunami in 7th century A.D. indirectly, could this be the time, when kaveripoompatinam was submerged? </p>
<p>Any thoughts, evidences, documents could be interesting..</p>

<p>I have visited the church atop the st thomas hill.<br />there is a piece of his bone, a piece of the lance that killed him and <br />more importantly a painting of jesus christ by st. luke himself( one <br />of the 13 apostles) so it must be the only painting of jesus by some <br />one who saw him</p>
<p>I dont know if they exhibit these things now.</p>
<p>I saw it in 1987</p>

<p>  Galileo was stoned because he said Earth moves<br />  around the Sun. Why <br />  this was not accepted? Because the bible said the<br />  sun moves around the <br />  earth and the christians didnt want to hear anything<br />  against bible. <br />  Now I think the same bible says the earth moves<br />  around the sun. So <br />  does this mean, Bible is saying the same thing for<br />  the past 2000 yeas?</p>

        <p>Dear Venkat<br />That was a very balanced veiw...</p>
<p>Nanda like venkat said there is no proof<br />but may be present the alternative arguement</p>
<p>St Thomas might have indeed come to India...because remember at that time India was a haven of jewels and spices which the romans and greeks and arabs regularly traded....</p>
<p>so may be one apostle was sent in this direction....may be he preached.....</p>
<p>but theres no proof for either or</p>
<p>We are doubting the visit of doubting thomas</p>
<p>dear vidhya</p>
<p>I understand your feelings...but I again agree with Venkat you are just being harsh to historians</p>
<p>If we started taking things down because there was something there before there wont be an end...</p>
<p>I know the feeling...I have been to Kasi Viswanath temple when your blood boils to see a dharga in the middle of the temple complex....</p>
<p>You feel that it was added so show be removed...</p>
<p>what if the singalese say the same about the tamil temples in lanka<br />or even the andras and karanataka folks because division can go in any line ....religion,languagecaste and creed....not to explain the divisions among them itself</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>history is about what happened. not what is right or wrong<br />===============================<br />VERY WELL MENTIONED.<br />=============================== <br />Thomas, also called Judas Thomas Didymus or Jude Thomas Didymus, was<br />one of the twelve apostles of Jesus.</p>
<p>Saint Thomas appears in a few passages in the Gospel of John.<br />John 11:16: Lazarus has just died, and the disciples are resisting <br />Jesus' decision to return to Judea, where the Jews had previously <br />tried to stone Jesus. Jesus is determined, but Thomas has the last <br />word: "Let us also go, that we might die with him" </p>
<p>In Thomas's best known appearance in the New Testament, Thomas<br />doubts the resurrection of Jesus and demands to feel Jesus' wounds<br />before <br />being convinced. This story is the origin of the term Doubting<br />Thomas. the Bible never states whether Thomas actually touched<br />Christ's wounds.</p>
<p>There is an early 3rd century text called "Acts of Thomas".<br />References to the work by Epiphanius show that it was in circulation<br />in the 4th century. The complete versions that survive are Syriac and<br />Greek.<br />The manuscripts end "The acts of Judas Thomas the apostle are <br />completed, which he did in India, fulfilling the commandment of him <br />that sent him. Unto whom be glory, world without end. Amen.".<br />so if it was a lie, then it was started pretty early.<br />==================================== <br />I remember to have read this earlier in support of his having landed<br />in the West Coast.</p>

        <p>Sridhar,<br />Yes, there are some who believe that Christ himself earned much of <br />his enlightment from the Himalayan region.<br />I also remember Rajinish writing this in one of his books. That a <br />valley in kashmir is named after him. I dont remember the exact name <br />of the place but the meaning is something close to sheperd's place.</p>

<p>  bayama? enakka? hahaa...neenga groupukku romba puduso?</p>
<p>  thoongindiruntha singatha ezhuppi vituteenga...I vowed not to write <br />  again in this group...yesterday a good friend from this group <br />called <br />  me late night (around 10.30) and told me not to waste time writing <br />in <br />  this group..because its useless..you better use your time in other <br />  better activities...noorthula oru vartha... but in 4 hours i broke <br />my <br />  vow....</p>
<p>  while coming back from office, after writing the earlier mail, <br />which <br />  was just out of curiosity with no intentions, one point struck a <br />nail <br />  in my head. Venkatesh has already told this group that its a proven <br />  fact that the current St.Thome church is built over the dismanteled <br />  temple of Kapaleeswarar. The basement is still visible. appo <br />St.Thomas <br />  samadhi mela than kapaleeswarar koil kattinangala? (Kamal, Thanks a <br />  lot. Now I understand what questioning is for knowing true <br />  history.... :) ) OR the kapali temple was built over St.Thomas's <br />tomb, <br />  which was dismanteled and agian exacavated to find the bones and <br />again <br />  a church was built on it? Then how come still the basement of the <br />  church is of that of Kapali koil. athan samadhiya thondum bothu <br />  basement remove panniyiruppangale?</p>
<p>  ITS BLACK AND WHITE THAT THIS STORY IS A MYTH. I remember hearing <br />that <br />  St.Thomas never visited India, in the first place.<br />  Your mail triggered the question more and I found this</p>
<p>  <a href="http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm" title="http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm">http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm</a></p>
<p>  A well researched article with substantiating evidences. I am <br />  surprised to note that a jain temple by name Neminathaswami also <br />  existed very near by the nataraja temple Or the kapali temple. <br />Also, <br />  the article quotes reference given by Dr.Nagaswamy (atleast ivaru <br />  sonnalavathu othupeengala?) that the inscriptions in the church <br />proves <br />  the existence of Kapali koil.Also it clearly states that the Kapali <br />  temple was demolished slowly and not dismanteled as Venkatesh <br />earlier <br />  quoted.</p>
<p>  So my dear friend, thanks for kindling my interest and to know more <br />  about TRUE HISTORY. Else I too would have been beliving that <br />St.Thomas <br />  visited India and was murdered by Hindu Brahmins.</p>
<p>  Last but not least, when Hindu's faith were torn apart in the name <br />of <br />  history in this group, where was Nanda or anyone else? WHY is it <br />that <br />  there is always a hue and cry when Christians or Muslims' history <br />are <br />  involved?<br />  This proves time and again that we Indians have been brain washed <br />to <br />  be Psuedo-Seculars.</p>
<p>  DO WE DESERVE TRUE HISTORY WHEN SUCH FALACIES LIE IN OUR HEARTS? I <br />  REPEAT MY EARLIER WORDS, 'WE NEED GUTS TO FACE TRUE HISTORY AND WE <br />  DONT HAVE THAT IN OUR HEARTS'. So lets not cheat ourselves saying <br />that <br />  we are interested in true history. I mean this and will neve take <br />it <br />  back, because this group claims that we are interested in True <br />  history, but when a historical question is posed in this group <br />which <br />  are pro-Hindu, this group cannot withstand it. Lets accept this <br />bitter <br />  fact.</p>

          History of San thome of Meliapore        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi all</p>
<p>history is common to all of us.<br />we cannot take sides. just like <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , or sundarapandian, thomas( if he <br />did come here) and ghaazni are a part of our history.</acronym></p>
<p>history is about what happened. not what is right or wrong</p>
<p>I scouted around for matter that might link thomas to india.</p>
<p>here is what I found</p>
<p>Thomas, also called Judas Thomas Didymus or Jude Thomas Didymus, was <br />one of the twelve apostles of Jesus.</p>
<p>Saint Thomas appears in a few passages in the Gospel of John.<br />John 11:16: Lazarus has just died, and the disciples are resisting <br />Jesus' decision to return to Judea, where the Jews had previously <br />tried to stone Jesus. Jesus is determined, but Thomas has the last <br />word: "Let us also go, that we might die with him" </p>
<p>In Thomas's best known appearance in the New Testament, Thomas doubts <br />the resurrection of Jesus and demands to feel Jesus' wounds before <br />being convinced. This story is the origin of the term Doubting Thomas. <br />the Bible never states whether Thomas actually touched Christ's <br />wounds.</p>
<p>There is an early 3rd century text called "Acts of Thomas". References <br />to the work by Epiphanius show that it was in circulation in the 4th <br />century. The complete versions that survive are Syriac and Greek.</p>
<p>The manuscripts end "The acts of Judas Thomas the apostle are <br />completed, which he did in India, fulfilling the commandment of him <br />that sent him. Unto whom be glory, world without end. Amen.".</p>
<p>so if it was a lie, then it was started pretty early.</p>

<p>thats to scientifically answer your question</p>
<p>Do I believe Santhome died in Mount....No is there a lance in his chamber in st thomas mount I dont recall seeing one</p>
<p>As a person educated in A Christian instituition it was said St Thomas is believed to have visited India but the true impact of Christianity only came from the Portuguese...</p>
<p>One may argue they are salesians so stick to the fact that christianity was brought to india by europeans....</p>
<p>There is astrong belief in certain quarters that Hinduism is what Christ preached as A religion and all the antiques he did was to learned from Yogis from himalayas (he visited India during the missing years</p>
<p>In a way (this is personal opinion) I actually like the fiction that St Thomas came to India it only proves the golden state India was then that his religion couldnt survive.In spite of my criticisms of certain social evils which have crept into our Religion...its still the greatest its a way of live.....so its seen throgh the Greeks,the mughals,the brits and so on...some of them have left an imprint...</p>
<p>As of VOI interesting read....quite rightist but justifiably so but may be you ll like this<br /><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14658b.htm" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14658b.htm">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14658b.htm</a><br />this site claims its a catholic encyclopaedia and it disproves the myth as well</p>
<p>So long folks</p>

<p>bayama? enakka? hahaa...neenga groupukku romba puduso?</p>
<p>thoongindiruntha singatha ezhuppi vituteenga...I vowed not to write <br />again in this group...yesterday a good friend from this group called <br />me late night (around 10.30) and told me not to waste time writing in <br />this group..because its useless..you better use your time in other <br />better activities...noorthula oru vartha... but in 4 hours i broke my <br />vow....</p>
<p>while coming back from office, after writing the earlier mail, which <br />was just out of curiosity with no intentions, one point struck a nail <br />in my head. Venkatesh has already told this group that its a proven <br />fact that the current St.Thome church is built over the dismanteled <br />temple of Kapaleeswarar. The basement is still visible. appo St.Thomas <br />samadhi mela than kapaleeswarar koil kattinangala? (Kamal, Thanks a <br />lot. Now I understand what questioning is for knowing true <br />history.... :) ) OR the kapali temple was built over St.Thomas's tomb, <br />which was dismanteled and agian exacavated to find the bones and again <br />a church was built on it? Then how come still the basement of the <br />church is of that of Kapali koil. athan samadhiya thondum bothu <br />basement remove panniyiruppangale?</p>
<p>ITS BLACK AND WHITE THAT THIS STORY IS A MYTH. I remember hearing that <br />St.Thomas never visited India, in the first place.<br />Your mail triggered the question more and I found this</p>
<p><a href="http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm" title="http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm">http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm</a></p>
<p>A well researched article with substantiating evidences. I am <br />surprised to note that a jain temple by name Neminathaswami also <br />existed very near by the nataraja temple Or the kapali temple. Also, <br />the article quotes reference given by Dr.Nagaswamy (atleast ivaru <br />sonnalavathu othupeengala?) that the inscriptions in the church proves <br />the existence of Kapali koil.Also it clearly states that the Kapali <br />temple was demolished slowly and not dismanteled as Venkatesh earlier <br />quoted.</p>
<p>So my dear friend, thanks for kindling my interest and to know more <br />about TRUE HISTORY. Else I too would have been beliving that St.Thomas <br />visited India and was murdered by Hindu Brahmins.</p>
<p>Last but not least, when Hindu's faith were torn apart in the name of <br />history in this group, where was Nanda or anyone else? WHY is it that <br />there is always a hue and cry when Christians or Muslims' history are <br />involved?<br />This proves time and again that we Indians have been brain washed to <br />be Psuedo-Seculars.</p>
<p>DO WE DESERVE TRUE HISTORY WHEN SUCH FALACIES LIE IN OUR HEARTS? I <br />REPEAT MY EARLIER WORDS, 'WE NEED GUTS TO FACE TRUE HISTORY AND WE <br />DONT HAVE THAT IN OUR HEARTS'. So lets not cheat ourselves saying that <br />we are interested in true history. I mean this and will neve take it <br />back, because this group claims that we are interested in True <br />history, but when a historical question is posed in this group which <br />are pro-Hindu, this group cannot withstand it. Lets accept this bitter <br />fact.</p>

        <p>Hi venkatesh,<br />Thanks for the welcome.<br />I could have been harsh but the historians are harsher on us.<br />Yeah, i accept that Hinduism was a concept rather a religion.<br />Hinduism has well formulated rules for healthy living, mind and body, <br />thats true.<br />True, that we had time to correct history. But with their already <br />set 'left' mind and almost all political parties to back up, no one <br />dares to change history. The problem is we still have the 'mogam' of <br />the whites. So everything outside india, including religion is pure <br />and not subject to criticism.<br />Even to say something bold will take you to misery, like just what <br />Kushboo fased about 'karpu'. </p>

        <p>Dear Satish<br />bones can stay fora considerable lenghth of time because its just minerals..<br />The whole body shrivels nad shrinks if mummified or embalmed<br />surprisingly it stays as it was when frozen in ice</p>
<p>thats to scientifically answer your question</p>
<p>Do I believe Santhome died in Mount....No is there a lance in his chamber in st thomas mount I dont recall seeing one</p>
<p>As a person educated in A Christian instituition it was said St Thomas is believed to have visited India but the true impact of Christianity only came from the Portuguese...</p>
<p>One may argue they are salesians so stick to the fact that christianity was brought to india by europeans....</p>
<p>There is astrong belief in certain quarters that Hinduism is what Christ preached as A religion and all the antiques he did was to learned from Yogis from himalayas (he visited India during the missing years</p>
<p>In a way (this is personal opinion) I actually like the fiction that St Thomas came to India it only proves the golden state India was then that his religion couldnt survive.In spite of my criticisms of certain social evils which have crept into our Religion...its still the greatest its a way of live.....so its seen throgh the Greeks,the mughals,the brits and so on...some of them have left an imprint...</p>
<p>As of VOI interesting read....quite rightist but justifiably so but may be you ll like this<br /><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14658b.htm" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14658b.htm">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14658b.htm</a><br />this site claims its a catholic encyclopaedia and it disproves the myth as well</p>
<p>So long folks</p>

<p>thoongindiruntha singatha ezhuppi vituteenga...I vowed not to write <br />again in this group...yesterday a good friend from this group called <br />me late night (around 10.30) and told me not to waste time writing in <br />this group..because its useless..you better use your time in other <br />better activities...noorthula oru vartha... but in 4 hours i broke my <br />vow....</p>
<p>while coming back from office, after writing the earlier mail, which <br />was just out of curiosity with no intentions, one point struck a nail <br />in my head. Venkatesh has already told this group that its a proven <br />fact that the current St.Thome church is built over the dismanteled <br />temple of Kapaleeswarar. The basement is still visible. appo St.Thomas <br />samadhi mela than kapaleeswarar koil kattinangala? (Kamal, Thanks a <br />lot. Now I understand what questioning is for knowing true <br />history.... :) ) OR the kapali temple was built over St.Thomas's tomb, <br />which was dismanteled and agian exacavated to find the bones and again <br />a church was built on it? Then how come still the basement of the <br />church is of that of Kapali koil. athan samadhiya thondum bothu <br />basement remove panniyiruppangale?</p>
<p>ITS BLACK AND WHITE THAT THIS STORY IS A MYTH. I remember hearing that <br />St.Thomas never visited India, in the first place.<br />Your mail triggered the question more and I found this</p>
<p><a href="http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm" title="http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm">http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm</a></p>
<p>A well researched article with substantiating evidences. I am <br />surprised to note that a jain temple by name Neminathaswami also <br />existed very near by the nataraja temple Or the kapali temple. Also, <br />the article quotes reference given by Dr.Nagaswamy (atleast ivaru <br />sonnalavathu othupeengala?) that the inscriptions in the church proves <br />the existence of Kapali koil.Also it clearly states that the Kapali <br />temple was demolished slowly and not dismanteled as Venkatesh earlier <br />quoted.</p>
<p>So my dear friend, thanks for kindling my interest and to know more <br />about TRUE HISTORY. Else I too would have been beliving that St.Thomas <br />visited India and was murdered by Hindu Brahmins.</p>
<p>Last but not least, when Hindu's faith were torn apart in the name of <br />history in this group, where was Nanda or anyone else? WHY is it that <br />there is always a hue and cry when Christians or Muslims' history are <br />involved?<br />This proves time and again that we Indians have been brain washed to <br />be Psuedo-Seculars.</p>
<p>DO WE DESERVE TRUE HISTORY WHEN SUCH FALACIES LIE IN OUR HEARTS? I <br />REPEAT MY EARLIER WORDS, 'WE NEED GUTS TO FACE TRUE HISTORY AND WE <br />DONT HAVE THAT IN OUR HEARTS'. So lets not cheat ourselves saying that <br />we are interested in true history. I mean this and will neve take it <br />back, because this group claims that we are interested in True <br />history, but when a historical question is posed in this group which <br />are pro-Hindu, this group cannot withstand it. Lets accept this bitter <br />fact.</p>

So lets not cheat ourselves saying <br />that <br />  we are interested in true history. I mean this and will neve take it <br />  back, because this group claims that we are interested in True <br />  history, but when a historical question is posed in this group which <br />  are pro-Hindu, this group cannot withstand it. Lets accept this <br />bitter <br />  fact.</p>

        <p>Nanda,</p>
<p>bayama? enakka? hahaa...neenga groupukku romba puduso?</p>
<p>thoongindiruntha singatha ezhuppi vituteenga...I vowed not to write <br />again in this group...yesterday a good friend from this group called <br />me late night (around 10.30) and told me not to waste time writing in <br />this group..because its useless..you better use your time in other <br />better activities...noorthula oru vartha... but in 4 hours i broke my <br />vow....</p>
<p>while coming back from office, after writing the earlier mail, which <br />was just out of curiosity with no intentions, one point struck a nail <br />in my head. Venkatesh has already told this group that its a proven <br />fact that the current St.Thome church is built over the dismanteled <br />temple of Kapaleeswarar. The basement is still visible. appo St.Thomas <br />samadhi mela than kapaleeswarar koil kattinangala? (Kamal, Thanks a <br />lot. Now I understand what questioning is for knowing true <br />history.... :) ) OR the kapali temple was built over St.Thomas's tomb, <br />which was dismanteled and agian exacavated to find the bones and again <br />a church was built on it? Then how come still the basement of the <br />church is of that of Kapali koil. athan samadhiya thondum bothu <br />basement remove panniyiruppangale?</p>
<p>ITS BLACK AND WHITE THAT THIS STORY IS A MYTH. I remember hearing that <br />St.Thomas never visited India, in the first place.<br />Your mail triggered the question more and I found this</p>
<p><a href="http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm" title="http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm">http://voi.org/books/hhce/Ch21.htm</a></p>
<p>A well researched article with substantiating evidences. I am <br />surprised to note that a jain temple by name Neminathaswami also <br />existed very near by the nataraja temple Or the kapali temple. Also, <br />the article quotes reference given by Dr.Nagaswamy (atleast ivaru <br />sonnalavathu othupeengala?) that the inscriptions in the church proves <br />the existence of Kapali koil.Also it clearly states that the Kapali <br />temple was demolished slowly and not dismanteled as Venkatesh earlier <br />quoted.</p>
<p>So my dear friend, thanks for kindling my interest and to know more <br />about TRUE HISTORY. Else I too would have been beliving that St.Thomas <br />visited India and was murdered by Hindu Brahmins.</p>
<p>Last but not least, when Hindu's faith were torn apart in the name of <br />history in this group, where was Nanda or anyone else? WHY is it that <br />there is always a hue and cry when Christians or Muslims' history are <br />involved?<br />This proves time and again that we Indians have been brain washed to <br />be Psuedo-Seculars.</p>
<p>DO WE DESERVE TRUE HISTORY WHEN SUCH FALACIES LIE IN OUR HEARTS? I <br />REPEAT MY EARLIER WORDS, 'WE NEED GUTS TO FACE TRUE HISTORY AND WE <br />DONT HAVE THAT IN OUR HEARTS'. So lets not cheat ourselves saying that <br />we are interested in true history. I mean this and will neve take it <br />back, because this group claims that we are interested in True <br />history, but when a historical question is posed in this group which <br />are pro-Hindu, this group cannot withstand it. Lets accept this bitter <br />fact.</p>

        <p>HI Satish,</p>
<p>Dont try to shake the belief of the faithful.. You might find that the heat is too much to handle, the order of the day is that blind faith is acceptable but questioning is not..maybe ramanujar did something similar to get the wrath of AthiRajendra(is it?) or Kulothunga?? Not sure which one is correct.</p>

<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>Nothing related to History, just a general curiousity.</p>
<p>If a dead body is buried, how long will the bones or any part of the <br />body, can remain without decay? There should be some time limit, <br />right, before we can get even the bones? Mummified - yes, but <br />without any preservation will the bones last for 1500 years before <br />the Portugese can unearth the bones of St.Thomas?</p>
<p>Just curious to know.</p>
