<p>A Prelude to the Research Article on Kodungallur</p>
<p>Kodungallur is a region in the southern tip of the present Thrissur<br />district of Kerala State, South India - adjoining the Arabian sea. Today<br />it remains a city of less commercial and industrial activities and<br />modern buildings. However it has centres of religious worship, namely<br />the Temples, Churches and Mosques.</p>
<p>Kodungallur was also known as Cranganore during the English occupation<br />of the region. It could be placed as the first region of Kerala "of much<br />historical importance", while Thiruvananthapuram the present capital of<br />Kerala could only take the third place, while Kollam takes the second<br />place.</p>
<p>However due to less developments in this region, it has not attracted<br />the attention of many Keralites who are still not aware of "the great<br />historical significance of this region in Kerala history". This could be<br />the possible reason why the Kerala Map Printers too show the name of<br />Kodungallur in tiny letters in their Kerala Maps, and in some Maps it is<br />not shown at all.</p>
<p>The objective of this Article is do give a deep insight into the actual<br />history of Kodungallur hitherto not known to many, and to highlight the<br />great significance of this region supported by evidences.</p>

<p>      Virarajendra:<br />      No, that URL or website was not part of your references and has nothing to do with your essay. I used it to double checking your citations. For example I could verify the 2 references in Mahabharatam, but did not see the Ramayanam one. It is possible that I missed or there were different translations of the material.</p>

          The great Significance of Kodungallur of Kerala        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Thiru V.Divakar,<br />Thanks for your comments.</p>
<p>The relevent section of the Hathigumpha Inscription under reference is as follows:</p>
<p>(L. 10) ..................(He) causes to be built . . . . a royal residence (called) the Palace of Great Victory (Mahavijaya) at the cost of thirty-eight hundred thousands. And in the tenth year (he), following (the three-fold policy) of chastisement, alliance and conciliation sends out an expedition against Bharatavasa (and) brings about the conquest of the land (or, country) ........ and obtains jewels and precious things of the (kings) attacked.</p>
<p>(L.11) .................. And the market-town (?) Pithumda founded by the Ava King he ploughs down with a plough of asses; and (he) thoroughlybreaks up the confederacy of the T[r]amira (Dramira) countries of one hundred and thirteen years, which has been a source of danger to (his) Country (Janapada). And in the twelfth year he terrifies the kings of the Utarapatha with .................. <br />thousands of......."</p>
<p>From: Epigraphia Indica, Vol. XX (1929-30).</p>
<p>agaist Bharatvarsha.</p>
<p>In the twelfth year he terrifies Uttarapatha.</p>
<p>As his breaking up of the confederacy Tramira (Dramira) countries is mentioned in between these two events, we can safely conclude that this event took place in his eleventh year.</p>
<p>Karavela's ascended the throne in B.C.170 as per other Historical Sources. Hence his year of defeat of the Tramira (Dramira) confederacy is 170 - 11 = B.C.159. The Confederacy lasted 113 years as per the above Inscription from the year (B.C.159 + B.C.113) = B.C.272 </p>
<p>Hence we could safely conclude, that the period of confederacy of the kingsof the Tamil (Dramira or Tramira)Countries, lasted from B.C.272 to B.C.159.</p>
<p>Thanks very much Mr Dhivakar. Your pointing out of something made me discover my own mistake. That is the Tamil Confederacy lasted from B.C.272 to B.C.159 and NOT from B.C.283 to B.C.170 as erronously stated by me in the thread which will be corrected. </p>
<p>But definitely not a period after Christ as seen above. </p>
<p>However I will be pleased if you could very kindly post the Full Text of Kandagiri - Bhuvaneshwar Inscription to verify further the correctness of theabove, which will be usefull to all of us in our quest for truth in history.</p>
<p>Thanking you very much</p>

<p>The great Significance of Kodungallur of Kerala in the history of Kerala &amp; Tamil Nadu : Part - 1</p>
<p>A Prelude to the Research Article on Kodungallur</p>
<p>Kodungallur<br />is a region in the southern tip of the present Thrissur district of<br />Kerala State, South India - adjoining the Arabian sea. Today it remains<br />a city of less commercial and industrial activities and modern<br />buildings. However it has centres of religious worship, namely the<br />Temples, Churches and Mosques.</p>
<p>Kodungallur was also known as Cranganore during the English<br />occupation of the region. It could be placed as the first region of<br />Kerala "of much historical importance",<br />while Thiruvananthapuram the present capital of Kerala could only take<br />the third place, while Kollam takes the second place. </p>
<p>However due to less developments in this region, it has not attracted<br />the attention of many Keralites who are still not aware of "the great historical significance of this region in Kerala history".<br />This could be the possible reason why the Kerala Map Printers too show<br />the name of Kodungallur in tiny letters in their Kerala Maps, and in<br />some Maps it is not shown at all. </p>
<p>The objective of this Article is do give a deep insight into the actual<br />history of Kodungallur hitherto not known to many, and to highlight the<br />great significance of this region supported by evidences. </p>
<p>(1) The two eras of Kerala History</p>
<p>The<br />history of the present Kerala State - South India could be divided into<br />two eras, one ranging from ancient times to the end of the twelth<br />century (A.D.1200) and classified as the Tamil Period of it's History, and the other ranging from the beginning of the thirteenth century (A.D.1201) to this date and classified as the Malayalam Period of it's History.</p>
<p>(2) The traditional geographical boundries of Kerala</p>
<p>Kerala<br />is the Sanskritised version of the Tamil "Chera", and the region of the<br />Chera country had as it's boundries the "Kolikkodu" in the west,<br />"Palani" in the north, "South Kaasi"(Ten Kasi) in the east, and the<br />seafront in the south covering eighty Kavatham of land (Kavatham - a<br />land measure).</p>
<p>Note:The<br />above is better understood, if taken as the Chera country encompassed<br />within the outer boundries Kolikkodu, Palani, Ten Kasi and Sea (south<br />beyond Kovalam).</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following reference: </p>
<p>".....Vadakku thisai Palani vaan Keel Then Kaasi Kudakku thisai Kolikkodaam- Kadatkaraiyil </p>
<p>oramo Thetkkahum ulla En Pathi Kavatham</p>
<p>Sera Naatu ellai ena seppu....." </p>
<p>Perunthohai by M.Ragavaiyangar, Verse - 2091, Madurai Thamil Sangam Publication 1935 - 1936</p>
<p>(3) The Kings of early Kerala</p>
<p>eastern part of the South India was ruled by Tamil Hindu kings, and<br />many Tamil Literary works of the early and medieval periods of both<br />Kerala and Tamil Nadu refer to them as the Chera kings. </p>
<p>The region of the former Chera country was encompassed within the<br />present Kerala state, while the regions of the former Chola and Pandiya<br />Countries were encompassed within the present Tamil Nadu State, and<br />were known in the early days as the "Muth Thamil Nadu" (three Tamil Countries). </p>
<p>These three Tamil countries from their early days had as their royal emblems the Bow (Chera), Fish (Pandiya), and Tiger (Chola) respectively in their flags.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references: </p>
<p>"........vada thisai marungin mannarkku ellaam then Thamil Naattu chelu Vil, Kayal, Puli manthalai aetra varaiha eengu"...... ."</p>
<p>Silappathikaaram - by Ilango Adihal, Vanji Kaandam, Kaatchi Kaathai U.V.Swaminatha Iyer edition</p>
<p>".......mudi udai venthar moovarullum </p>
<p>kudathisai aalum kotram kuntraa</p>
<p>aaram maarpit Chera kulathu uthiththor.. ..."</p>
<p>Silappathikaaram - by Ilango Adihal, Vanji Kaandam - Katturai. U.V.Swaminatha Iyer edition</p>
<p>(4) Earliest references to Kerala in early Indian Literature</p>
<p>The<br />earliest known references to the Kerala (Chera Nadu) in the Indian<br />Literature are found in the original Sanskrit epics - namely the<br />Ramaayana of poet Vaalmihi, and the Mahaabhaaratha. of poet Viyaasar.</p>
<p>In Ramaayana it is noted Sukkrivan requesting Anuman to go in<br />search of Sita in the countries in the southern regions of India among<br />the Kerala, Pundhara, Chola and Pandiya countries.</p>
<p>In Mahaabhaaratha we find Sanjayan while mentioning the countries<br />in the south of India to king Thirutharastra, refers to Kerala along<br />with Andhra, Karnataka and Chola. Mahabharatha further states the<br />Keralas along with the Pandiyas and Cholas fought on the side of the<br />Pandavas in the Mahabharatha war.</p>
<p>There are `many' other references to Keralas in the Viyasa's<br />Mahabharatha.. (Refer to my thread titled "The references to Tamil<br />dynasties and countries in the Mahabharatha" in this same Website)</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references: </p>
<p>"...sarvam eve anupashyata tathaiva Aandhraan ca Pundran ca Colaan, Paandyaan, Keralaan.... ."</p>
<p>Ramayana - by Valmiki, Kishkinda Kanda,Volume 4, Chapter 41, Lines 12  </p>
<p>"……Sanjaya<br />said, listen to me O king (Thiratharastra) ........to the names of the<br />provinces as I mention them. They are.......the Keralas..... .the<br />Andhras..... ."</p>
<p>".....There are other kingdoms O bull of Bharatha's race, in the<br />south. They are the Dravidas, the Keralas..... .the Karanatakas. .....the<br />Cholas....... " </p>
<p>Mahabharatha – by Viyasa, Bhisma Parva, Page 21&amp; 22 </p>
<p>"........When<br />that host was being thus struck and slain by heroic warriors, the<br />Parthas headed by Vrikodara advance against us. They consisted of<br />Dhrishtayumna and Sikhandin, and the five sons of Draupadi, and the<br />Prabhadrakes, and Satyaki, and Chekitana with the Dravida forces, and<br />the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas, surrounded by a mighty<br />array,....... ".  </p>
<p>Mahabharatha – by Viyasa, Karna Parva, Page 25. </p>
<p>(5) The Confederacy of the Kerala (Chera), Chola and Pandiya</p>
<p>In South India there has been a confederacy<br />of the Tamil kingdoms (Tamira Countries) of Chera, Chola, and Pandiya<br />(Muth Tamil Nadu) to jointly prevent the kings of the north and central<br />India from invading their countries. This confederacy that existed for<br />113 years from B.C.283 was broken by king Karavela of Kalinga in the<br />year B.C.170, which was a potential threat to his own kingdom. </p>
<p>The Tamil kingdoms of Chera, Chola and Pandiya of that period, ensured<br />the unity of the southern Tamil Nadu of that period, even at the times<br />of their individual invasions of the northern Ariyan kings. The Ariyan<br />kings too recognised the unity, and the strength of the Tamil kings and<br />have referred to them as the kings of the Tamil Nadu in the south, who<br />have carved their royal emblems the Bow, Tiger and Fish individually on<br />the mountain range of the Himalayas, at different times. </p>
<p>The Kerala kings too in their North Indian expeditions, considered it<br />as a great pride to have carved their emblem the Bow on the Himalayas,<br />and having seen the Thamilakam (Chera, Chola &amp; Pandiya) of that<br />period bound by seas all round, stressing on their unity.</p>
<p>This confederacy of the three southern Tamil kingdoms the Kerala<br />(Chera), Chola and Pandiya, prevented the Maurya Emperor Asoka too from<br />conquereing their countries in Southern India. This could have been the<br />reason why when his domains extended as far as Mysore, he has referred<br />in his Second Rock Edict that the Kerala (Chera), Chola, and Pandiya<br />countries as being beyond his domains. However King Asoka were<br />successful in penetrating the three Tamil countries as far as<br />Tamiraparni river in south Pandiya Nadu, with his Buddhist Dhamma<br />religious mission</p>
<p>In the above edict the Keralas are mentioned as the Keralaputras,<br />that is the Putras of Kerala, meaning the sons of the soil of Kerala.<br />people of North India also during the period of the Maurya Emperor<br />Asoka, who ruled the Maghada kingdom from B.C.273 - 236. </p>
<p>The Fourteenth Edict of Asokan period has only mentioned of the Cholas<br />and Pandyas, but it is already clear that they knew of the kingdom of<br />Kerala in the South India as seen from the Second Edict. </p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references: </p>
<p>"........... .vada Aariyar padai kadanththu</p>
<p>then Thamil Naadu orungu kaana....... ." </p>
<p>Silappathikaaram - by Ilango Adihal, Mathurai Kaandam, Katturai kaathai  </p>

<p>(6) The Rivers flowing in the close vicinity of Kodungallur of Kerala (Chera) </p>
<p>Among all the rivers flowing across Kerala,<br />the longest river is the present Periyar river, flowing in to the<br />Kodungallur Lagoon (Lagoon - a lake fed by sea water). The present<br />Periyar of Kerala was originally known as the Periyaru meaning the big<br />river (in Tamil). However it's original name was not merely Periyaru,<br />but was known as the "Chulliyam Periyaru" of Cheras. </p>
<p>We see many references to different rivers in India with such name<br />combinations namely as Gangai Periyaru, Kaviri Periyaru, Pennai<br />Periyaru, Vaikai Periyaru etc. Hence from the foregoing it is clear the<br />Periyaru has been used in the sense of "Periya Aru" (in Tamil) meaning<br />the big River, with their actual names prefixed to the term Periyaru.<br />Hence it is clear that "Chulliyam" was the original name of the<br />Periyaru of Kerala, which the poet states belonged to the Chera kings<br />(Cheralar).</p>
<p>Also there is another river named Pullut Phuza (Pullut River) which<br />flows from the north of Kerala passing adjacent to the present<br />Kodungallur region - the former Vanchi nagar, and then turns around<br />this region to the west and falls into the same Kodungallur Lagoon. The<br />Pullut Phuza (Phuza in Malayalam = River) was the former Aan Porunai<br />River(in Tamil) mentioned in many Tamil Literary works of the early<br />period, and positively confirmed by Silappathikaram as surrounding the<br />Vanji nagar is of much importance in the Kerala (Chera history). </p>
<p>There is the third river named Chalakkudi which joins with Periyar near<br />present Chowkakadavu and then falls into the Kodungallur Lagoon. From<br />the Kodungallur Lagoon the confluence of these three rivers falls in to<br />the nearby sea at the present Alikode (Aalikkodu), the former region of<br />the famed seaport city of Musiri.   </p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references: </p>
<p>In Ahananooru the rivers Chulliyam, Kaviri, Pennai of south India, and Ganga of north India are referred to as Periyaaru.</p>

<p>(7) The Musiri the earliest known Seaport city of Kerala near Kodungallur  </p>
<p>The Musiri is the earliest known seaport<br />city of the Kerala (Chera-Kothai) kings at the estuary of the<br />confluence of three rivers, at the present Alikode in west Kerala<br />adjacent to the sea. </p>
<p>The scenic description of the Musiri port is described in the contemporary period Tamil Literary work Puranaanooru as follows: : </p>
<p>"…..With<br />the fish piled up and the paddy heaped within the elevated house of<br />boats (ambi) with the pepper bags (too) within this house (outer)<br />fortification, brought the load to the shore of the sea where the<br />seaport Musiri was situated possibly along the rivers (undoubtedly<br />along Aan Porunai, Chulliam Periyaru, and Chalakkudi), (where) the<br />ships with gifts of gold (too) brought to shore by small ships (thoni)<br />– (thus) the products of hills and the seas unloaded and distributed to<br />those who came there (for trading) was the Kuttuvan's Musiri (port)<br />with noise of the roaring sea…..".   </p>
<p>The Greeks and the Romans with the<br />discovery of the favourable wind named "Hippalus" (in A.D.47),<br />travelled to the nearest seaport of India namely the Musiri in much<br />quicker time of forty days from the Ocelis port of Arabia.</p>
<p>The first known reference to Musiri from the external sources comes<br />from the Roman Historian named Pliny in A.D.77, who refers to Musiri as<br />a seat of goverment under the rule of Chera kings was a seaport city at<br />the height of prosperity frequented by ships and was of leading<br />importance. Muziris of the Cheras abounds in ships sent there with<br />note this king was the Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan (A.D.74 - 132). </p>
<p>Further reference to Muziris is made in A.D.100 by a Greek historian named Periplus who states "….Musiri<br />was not a desirable place of call, with pirates being in the<br />neighbourhood who occupied a place called Nitrias (the Naruvu as known<br />to Tamils north of Musiri occupied by Kadambar) and besides it is not<br />well supplied with wares for traffic. Ships besides anchor at a great<br />distance from the shore and cargoes have to be landed and shipped by<br />employing boats. During this time the Caelobothras (Keralaputhra) was<br />the sovereign of that country….."   </p>
<p>The Musiri being the seaport city of the Chera kingdom is also confirmed byPtolemy in the year A.D.150. He refers to ".....Musiri Emporium as a sea port city that was ruled at that time by Kerobothras. ...." <br />which is a corruption of Cheraputhras or Keralaputhras, as found in the<br />Asokan Inscriptions, meaning the people of Kerala (Chera) country.</p>
<p>Further from the Ptolemy's geographical cordinates it is clear that<br />the Muziris emporium a seaport city was situated immediately north and<br />at the mouth of the Pseudostomos river, identified as the "specific<br />reference" to the "AanPorunai river" (present Pullut river), entering<br />the sea as a confluence of three rivers the other two being the Periyar<br />and the Chalakkudi rivers.</p>
<p>Hence the sea port city of the Chera Nadu of the first and second<br />century A.D. known as Musiri could be very positively located at the<br />river (mouth) estuary of the confluence of these three rivers the<br />principal river among them being the Periyar river, where they meet the<br />sea around the present Alikode region near the Kodungallur.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references</p>

If the wind called Hippalus be blowing Muziris<br />the nearest mart of India can be reached in forty days.

It lies near a<br />river at a distance from Tyndis of 500 stadia whether measured from<br />river to river or by the length of the sea voyage and it is 20 stadia<br />distant from the mouth of its own river.

<p>(8) Subsequent invasion of Musiri by the Pandiyan king Cheliyan  </p>
<p>"Ahanaanooru" we also come to know that the Pandiyan Cheliyan once<br />raided the ancient estuary (of Periyar) at Musiri (seaport city), where<br />the warlike Cheliyan (Pandiyan king) with tall strong elephant<br />surrounded (the city) to the shock (of the inhabitants) raided in<br />severe battle, and took (to himself) the statue. </p>
<p>Among two other poems from "Ahanaanooru" , one confirms that the<br />Pandiyan (king) Cheliyan raided the city of Musiri at the estuary<br />(Musiri munthurai), while the other refers he having won the Cheral<br />(possibly ruling Musiri), and in both the Cheliyan has been referred to<br />as having "koi suvar puravi kodi ther" meaning the `Cheliyan with<br />chariot having horses of trimmed mane and flag'. Hence the the Pandiyan<br />king Cheliyan was no other than the "Thalai Alanganaththu seru ventra<br />Cheliyan" as seen in one of the latter two poems of Ahanaanooru.</p>
<p>It is noted that there is no reference in these poems to him<br />capturing the Karur or Vanji in the same raid, being the capital city<br />of the Chera kings. This indicates the purpose of the raid by Pandiyan<br />Cheliyan was to `secure to himself a Statue'(padimam vaviya) from the<br />seaport city of Musiri, that has been of much value and importance to<br />him.</p>
<p>At the time of this raid the Kadamba king (known for their pirate<br />activities) named Erumaiyooran ruled from Naravu north of Musiri. </p>
<p>This above are confirmed by the following references</p>
<p>"........valam elu Musiri arrpu ela valaiyee </p>

<p>(9) The Karuvur the earliest known inland capital city of Kerala near Kodungallur  </p>
<p>The inland capital of the earliest known<br />Kerala (Chera) kings was the Karuvur also known as Karur. (The latter<br />is also spelt as Karoor with the same pronounciation) . This capital<br />city was located at the present Karuvapadna, a little distance north<br />from the Kodungallur Lagoon along the present Pullut river (former Aan<br />Porunai river) and on the right side of it near the present Vallivattom<br />bridge. </p>
<p>It is clearly evident that the present Karuvapadna and the region<br />surrounding same were the former Karuvur Pattinam of the Cheras, which<br />is confirmed by the very fact the regions in and around Karuvapadna are<br />known even today as Karoor Paadam, Karoorpadna junction, Karoorpadna<br />Kulam etc. This was undoubtedly the ancient Karur City, and is<br />confirmed in the above reference that it was the royal seat meaning the<br />capital city of the Kerobothras (the Keralas or Cheras). </p>
<p>It is also shown in the Ptolemy's map that it was located a little<br />interior but not far from Musiri, and on the right side of the river<br />Pseudostomos river. Further we are aware that all three rivers namely<br />the Periyar, the Chalakudi, and the Pullut river that meets at the<br />Kodungallur Lagoon and falling into the sea, are not shown in Ptolemy's<br />map. Only one river is shown in same, and is also mentioned that the<br />Karoura - the royal seat of Kerobothras was on its right side adjacent<br />to it.</p>
<p>map, it is clear that the river shown in his map is no other than the<br />"Aan Porunai river" the present Pulut Puzha (not the river Periyaru or<br />the river Chalakudi), which flows adjacent to and on the right side of<br />the present Kodungallur (the region of Vanji Nagar - the later capital<br />of Cheras), and a little distance upstream in the northernly direction<br />it is seen that the "Aan Porunai river" flows adjacent to and on the<br />left side of the present Karuvapadna the region of Karuvur - the former<br />capital of Cheras. The Ptolemy's map refers to it as "Carura Regia<br />Cerobothri" - the Karur kingdom of Cheras. This reference of Ptolemy on<br />Karuvur, is the first evidence available to us presently in any<br />historical or literary documents of that period, as being the captal<br />city of Cheras.</p>
<p>noted that Karuvur was adjacent to the Aan Porunai River. Karuvur<br />served as the earlier interior capital of Cheras, while Musiri remained<br />the seaport capital during this period.</p>
<p>The Ships coming to then Chera Nadu from foreign countries anchored<br />at Musiri harbour the first known seaport city of Cheras which<br />stretched from the seafront near present Alikode upto the of<br />Kodungallur Lagoon. Just little beyond on the north-east of this lagoon<br />along the Pullut River (Aan Porunai river) was the region known as the<br />"Karuvur Munthurai" (Mun Thurai = Harbour Front : Harbour is a section<br />of a river or sea opposite a landmass region used for parking or<br />harbouring - small boats and Thonis or large ships, and Kalangal) which<br />is referred to in the Ahanaanooru as "….more than the sand (crystals)<br />on the high bunds of clear water Aan Porunai river at the Harbour front<br />of the prosperous and wonderous large city of Karuvur of the Kothai<br />(Chera) king, with the strong elephant and tall Chariot….." </p>
<p>note the term "Munthurai" is used to mean the "harbour front". The<br />harbour front of Kaviri river - refers to Poompuhar or<br />Kaviripoompattinam the seaport city of Cholas, the "harbour front" at<br />Kotkai - refers to the Kotkai seaport city of Pandiyas, harbour front<br />at Musiri - refers to the Musiri seaport city of Cheras (Keralas).</p>
<p>Hence it is clear that there was also a "harbour front" opposite<br />Karuvur near the present Vallivattom bridge just beyond the Kodungaloor<br />lagoon along the Pullut River the former Aan Porunai river, up to which<br />it was navigable for small boats and ships, with goods from Musiri port<br />to the interior capital the Karuvur. </p>
<p>king who rose on the throne of Karuvur and ruled Chera Nadu was Koperum<br />Cheral Irumporai.</p>
<p>Important Note : <br />The present Karuvur region near Thirutchiraappalli in TamilNadu, was<br />one of the earliest capital city of the Cholas long before Uraiyur.<br />Some of the Chera kings who became powerfull during the early and<br />medieval periods, also captured this Karuvur city from the Cholas and<br />ruled over same (leaving some inscriptions on their endowments made<br />during that time to the temples in this region), but many times lost<br />same back to Cholas. The Karuvur or Karur of Cheras and that of Cholas<br />are two different entities. </p>
<p>that the Ministers after the death of the Chola king at Karuvur met at<br />a region known as Kalumalam and gave a (trained) Elephant with a<br />garland and instigated it to select by garlanding the next successor to<br />the Chola throne. Accordingly the Elephant went to the city of Karuvur<br />and garlanded on the very young Karikatcholan who was accepted and<br />crowned as the next Chola king at Karuvur, This traditional story is<br />referred to in Palamoli Naanooru as follows.</p>
<p>Further in the Periyapuraanam in the chapter on Puhal Chola<br />Naayanaar a reference again confirms beyond doubt the Karuvur at<br />Thirutchirapalli district was the early traditional capital of the<br />Cholas and not that of Cheras</p>
<p>In the above `further evidence' is thrown to prove that Karuvur at<br />present Thirutchi was the the ancient capital of Cholas and not of<br />Cheras by the mere fact the king of the "kuda pulam" the Cherar brought<br />tributaries to the Chola at Karuvur a procession of tall elephants. </p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references</p>

<p>(10) The change of capital city from Karuvur to Vanji  </p>
<p>The Karuvur didnot last too long as the<br />interior capital city of the Chera Country, possibly because of the<br />geographical location of same. When we have a close look at the present<br />Karuvapadna - north of Kodungallur, we note many water inroads in the<br />region of the main city. This was possibly caused by the flooding of<br />Karuvur "harbour front" region by the waters of Aan Porunai River<br />(Pullut River) during monsoon times, and having more water inroads<br />geographically and making the city more vulnerable, found it necessary<br />for the Cheras to shift their capital city to a more habitable land<br />area on the left side of the Aan Porunai River, but keeping in the<br />close proximity to their seaport city the Musiri, and this region was<br />named as the Vanji Nagar which became the subsequent interior capital<br />city of the Cheras possibly from the first century B.C. </p>
<p>Karuvur and Vanji were not the exactly the same location, but a little<br />distant apart and both being at different locations on either side of<br />the Aan Porunai river (Pullut river) as noted from Ahanaanooru and<br />Silappathikaram.</p>
<p>However the distance being not too far apart from each other made<br />the poets who composed the Tamil Nihandus (ancient Tamil dictionaries)<br />namely the Chudamani Nihandu, Pingala Nihandu etc to mention in their<br />compositions that Karuvur and Vanji are the same.</p>
<p>The Tamil Literary Work Puraranaannoru states the Vanji Nagar city<br />walls was adjacent to the river Aan Porunai (present Pullut river) the<br />waves of which were striking this wall. The Tamil works such<br />Sirrupaanaartrupada i, Silapathikaaram, Puranaanooru confirms the river<br />Aan Porunai was flowing sourrounding by the side of Vanji Nagar. The<br />Cheras were also known as Kuda Naadaan and Vanjikomaan and Kothai kings.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references: </p>

<p>(11) The first Kerala (Chera) Tamil empire of the first century A.D.  </p>
<p>The greatest among the Kerala (Chera) kings<br />throughout the Tamil and Malayalam periods of the Kerala History was<br />the Tamil Chera king Imayavramban Nedun Cheralathan, and his son Cheran Chenguttuvan.</p>
<p>Imayavramban Nedun Cheralathan was the Tamil Chera king who ruled from<br />Vanji Nager (Kodungallur) during the period A.D.74 -132. He was the son<br />of the Chera king Uthiyan Cheralathan and Queen Nallini daughter of the<br />Kerala chieften Veliyan Venmaal. He ruled for 58 years. </p>
<p>He became very powerful and went on a expedition towards north of India<br />and defeated and won over many Aryan kings in the central and northern<br />India, and carved the Chera royal emblem the "bow" on the Himalayan<br />mountain. He also turned his attention on the Indo-Greek king (Yavanar)<br />ruling in then Bactria - a region now covered within the present<br />Pakistan, captured the king and on he agreeing to pay tributes handed<br />his kingdom back to him, and returned back to his kingdom with tributes<br />of diamonds and other valuables from this king. </p>
<p>However he maintained good relations with the other Tamil kingdoms of<br />then South India, namely the Cholas and the Pandiyas. His authority<br />extended over many kingdoms between the Himalayas up to Kanyakumari<br />down south and thus he could be classified as the emperor of the first<br />Kerala (Chera) empire. </p>
<p>Imayavaramban Nedun Cheralathan was succeeded by his able son Cheran<br />Senguttuvan on the Chera throne inheriting the vast empire from his<br />father, and ruled from the Vanji Nagar during the period A.D.132 -187.<br />He was the son of the Chera king Nedun Cheralathan and Queen Manakkilli<br />the daughter of the Chola king Nedumudikkilli ruling Chola Nadu from<br />Kaviripoompattinam (Poompuhar).</p>
<p>Cheran Chenguttuvan in a batlle at Kongu Nadu was assisted by the forces ofthe Cholas and Pandiyas. He ruled for 55 years. </p>
<p>He had a younger brother who abdicated being the Chera prince, and<br />became a Jain Monk and lived in Kunavaayil Kottam (the temple at the<br />eastern entrance of the Vanji Nagar.</p>
<p>With the death of his father Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan in<br />A.D.132 he set out on an expedition towards North India with his mother<br />Manakkilli to enable her perform the religious rights to her husband<br />and have a holy bath at the river Ganges. </p>
<p>On his way to North India he had to meet the stiff resistance from some<br />of the north Indian kings before he reached the Ganges river,<br />eventhough his father defeated these kings earlier and exacted tributes<br />from them..</p>
<p>He thus again defeated the Konkans, Kalingas, Karnatakas, Bangalas,<br />Gangas, the Katiyas (Kakatiyas) with the Aryans of the North who<br />obstructed </p>
<p>The greatness of these two kings namely the father and the son can be<br />seen from the following references in the great Tamil Literary Works of<br />the contemperary period.</p>
<p>"singing the glory of the king who ruled the country of the Yavanas<br />of hard words, the solid big stone (mountain) and the southern Kumari,<br />the one who protects the fame of the countries of Bow, Kayal Fish and<br />Tiger (emblems namely the Chera, Chola and Pandiyas…." </p>
<p>"…..Should this be your effort to make all the lands within the seas<br />from all sides of India to be the TamilNadu then there is no one to<br />oppose you……"</p>
<p>the conquered the Ariyan kings to shout and carved the bow (emblem)<br />on the ancient northern mountain range (Himalayas) and and captured the<br />the fierce kings released the Aryan kings from his intense captivity<br />the son given birth by Manakkilli (daughter) of the Chola king, by the<br />the king of Kuda Nadu the Neduncheralathan with victorius flag praised<br />by the Northerners, went through the jungles fast like the arrow for<br />want of stone for carving the statue of Goddess Paththini defeated the<br />chief of the Ariya kings and reached the Gangai with noisy<br />tributaries…" </p>
<p>the Cheralathan who reigned the world with one rule (from) the Kumari<br />(Kanyakumari) to the northern Himalayas, the daughter of the Chola of<br />shining Solar race who gave birth to the son who, won the Kongu king at<br />the redish battle field, and who went to the shores of the great river<br />Gangai…..</p>
<p>the kings within the range of mountains with of granite stone where<br />the God resides as the northern boundry the Himalayas, and the southern<br />Kumari rose with war drums having big battles, defeated the countries<br />of different languages of their ancient beauty and with warriors of<br />fighting fit thy Kuttuva….</p>
<p>though ruled the prosperous land of the Yavanas (Indo Greeks) of hard words, and 26+</p>
<p>d the mountain range of golden shine (Himalayas)</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references: </p>
<p>This is confirmed by the pathikam (the<br />introductory poem) of the second Paththu of the Tamil Literary work<br />called Pathirtrupatthu, Ahanaanooru and Silappathikaaram, as follows:  </p>

          The great Significance of Kodungallur of Kerala        </div>
      
      <div class="content">

<p>(Copyright reserved to Author)<br />Part - 2 to follow</p>
<p>The great Significance of Kodungallur of Kerala in the history of Kerala<br />&amp; Tamil Nadu : Part - 1</p>
<p>A Prelude to the Research Article on Kodungallur</p>
<p>Kodungallur is a region in the southern tip of the present Thrissur<br />district of Kerala State, South India - adjoining the Arabian sea. Today<br />it remains a city of less commercial and industrial activities and<br />modern buildings. However it has centres of religious worship, namely<br />the Temples, Churches and Mosques.</p>
<p>Kodungallur was also known as Cranganore during the English occupation<br />of the region. It could be placed as the first region of Kerala "of much<br />historical importance", while Thiruvananthapuram the present capital of<br />Kerala could only take the third place, while Kollam takes the second<br />place.</p>
<p>However due to less developments in this region, it has not attracted<br />the attention of many Keralites who are still not aware of "the great<br />historical significance of this region in Kerala history". This could be<br />the possible reason why the Kerala Map Printers too show the name of<br />Kodungallur in tiny letters in their Kerala Maps, and in some Maps it is<br />not shown at all.</p>
<p>The objective of this Article is do give a deep insight into the actual<br />history of Kodungallur hitherto not known to many, and to highlight the<br />great significance of this region supported by evidences.</p>
<p>(1) The two eras of Kerala History</p>
<p>The history of the present Kerala State - South India could be divided<br />into two eras, one ranging from ancient times to the end of the twelth<br />century (A.D.1200) and classified as the Tamil Period of it's History,<br />and the other ranging from the beginning of the thirteenth century<br />(A.D.1201) to this date and classified as the Malayalam Period of it's<br />History.</p>
<p>(2) The traditional geographical boundries of Kerala</p>
<p>Kerala is the Sanskritised version of the Tamil "Chera", and the region<br />of the Chera country had as it's boundries the "Kolikkodu" in the west,<br />"Palani" in the north, "South Kaasi"(Ten Kasi) in the east, and the<br />seafront in the south covering eighty Kavatham of land (Kavatham - a<br />land measure).</p>
<p>Note:The above is better understood, if taken as the Chera country<br />encompassed within the outer boundries Kolikkodu, Palani, Ten Kasi and<br />Sea (south beyond Kovalam).</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following reference:</p>
<p>".....Vadakku thisai Palani vaan Keel Then Kaasi Kudakku thisai<br />Kolikkodaam - Kadatkaraiyil<br />oramo Thetkkahum ulla En Pathi Kavatham<br />Sera Naatu ellai ena seppu....."</p>
<p>Perunthohai by M.Ragavaiyangar, Verse - 2091, Madurai Thamil Sangam<br />Publication 1935 - 1936</p>
<p>(3) The Kings of early Kerala</p>
<p>eastern part of the South India was ruled by Tamil Hindu kings, and many<br />Tamil Literary works of the early and medieval periods of both Kerala<br />and Tamil Nadu refer to them as the Chera kings.</p>
<p>The region of the former Chera country was encompassed within the<br />present Kerala state, while the regions of the former Chola and Pandiya<br />Countries were encompassed within the present Tamil Nadu State, and were<br />known in the early days as the "Muth Thamil Nadu" (three Tamil<br />Countries).</p>
<p>These three Tamil countries from their early days had as their royal<br />emblems the Bow (Chera), Fish (Pandiya), and Tiger (Chola) respectively<br />in their flags.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>
<p>"........vada thisai marungin mannarkku ellaam then Thamil Naattu chelu<br />Vil, Kayal, Puli manthalai aetra varaiha eengu"......."</p>
<p>Silappathikaaram - by Ilango Adihal, Vanji Kaandam, Kaatchi Kaathai<br />U.V.Swaminatha Iyer edition</p>
<p>".......mudi udai venthar moovarullum<br />kudathisai aalum kotram kuntraa<br />aaram maarpit Chera kulathu uthiththor....."</p>
<p>Silappathikaaram - by Ilango Adihal, Vanji Kaandam - Katturai.<br />U.V.Swaminatha Iyer edition</p>
<p>(4) Earliest references to Kerala in early Indian Literature</p>
<p>The earliest known references to the Kerala (Chera Nadu) in the Indian<br />Literature are found in the original Sanskrit epics - namely the<br />Ramaayana of poet Vaalmihi, and the Mahaabhaaratha.of poet Viyaasar.</p>
<p>In Ramaayana it is noted Sukkrivan requesting Anuman to go in search of<br />Sita in the countries in the southern regions of India among the Kerala,<br />Pundhara, Chola and Pandiya countries.</p>
<p>In Mahaabhaaratha we find Sanjayan while mentioning the countries in the<br />south of India to king Thirutharastra, refers to Kerala along with<br />Andhra, Karnataka and Chola. Mahabharatha further states the Keralas<br />along with the Pandiyas and Cholas fought on the side of the Pandavas in<br />the Mahabharatha war.</p>
<p>There are `many' other references to Keralas in the Viyasa's<br />Mahabharatha. (Refer to my thread titled "The references to Tamil<br />dynasties and countries in the Mahabharatha" in this same Website)</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>
<p>"...sarvam eve anupashyata tathaiva Aandhraan ca Pundran ca Colaan,<br />Paandyaan, Keralaan....."</p>
<p>Ramayana - by Valmiki, Kishkinda Kanda,Volume 4, Chapter 41, Lines 12</p>
<p>"??Sanjaya said, listen to me O king (Thiratharastra).......to the<br />names of the provinces as I mention them. They are.......the<br />Keralas......the Andhras......"</p>
<p>".....There are other kingdoms O bull of Bharatha's race, in the south.<br />They are the Dravidas, the Keralas......the Karanatakas......the<br />Cholas......"</p>
<p>Mahabharatha ? by Viyasa, Bhisma Parva, Page 21&amp; 22</p>
<p>"........When that host was being thus struck and slain by heroic<br />warriors, the Parthas headed by Vrikodara advance against us. They<br />consisted of Dhrishtayumna and Sikhandin, and the five sons of Draupadi,<br />and the Prabhadrakes, and Satyaki, and Chekitana with the Dravida<br />forces, and the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas, surrounded by a<br />mighty array,......".</p>
<p>Mahabharatha ? by Viyasa, Karna Parva, Page 25.</p>
<p>(5) The Confederacy of the Kerala (Chera), Chola and Pandiya</p>
<p>In South India there has been a confederacy of the Tamil kingdoms<br />(Tamira Countries) of Chera, Chola, and Pandiya (Muth Tamil Nadu) to<br />jointly prevent the kings of the north and central India from invading<br />their countries. This confederacy that existed for 113 years from<br />B.C.283 was broken by king Karavela of Kalinga in the year B.C.170,<br />which was a potential threat to his own kingdom.</p>
<p>The Tamil kingdoms of Chera, Chola and Pandiya of that period, ensured<br />the unity of the southern Tamil Nadu of that period, even at the times<br />of their individual invasions of the northern Ariyan kings. The Ariyan<br />kings too recognised the unity, and the strength of the Tamil kings and<br />have referred to them as the kings of the Tamil Nadu in the south, who<br />have carved their royal emblems the Bow, Tiger and Fish individually on<br />the mountain range of the Himalayas, at different times.</p>
<p>The Kerala kings too in their North Indian expeditions, considered it as<br />a great pride to have carved their emblem the Bow on the Himalayas, and<br />having seen the Thamilakam (Chera, Chola &amp; Pandiya) of that period bound<br />by seas all round, stressing on their unity.</p>
<p>This confederacy of the three southern Tamil kingdoms the Kerala<br />(Chera), Chola and Pandiya, prevented the Maurya Emperor Asoka too from<br />conquereing their countries in Southern India. This could have been the<br />reason why when his domains extended as far as Mysore, he has referred<br />in his Second Rock Edict that the Kerala (Chera), Chola, and Pandiya<br />countries as being beyond his domains. However King Asoka were<br />successful in penetrating the three Tamil countries as far as<br />Tamiraparni river in south Pandiya Nadu, with his Buddhist Dhamma<br />religious mission</p>
<p>In the above edict the Keralas are mentioned as the Keralaputras, that<br />is the Putras of Kerala, meaning the sons of the soil of Kerala. From<br />the above it is very clear that the Keralas were known to the people of<br />North India also during the period of the Maurya Emperor Asoka, who<br />ruled the Maghada kingdom from B.C.273 - 236.</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Edict of Asokan period has only mentioned of the Cholas<br />and Pandyas, but it is already clear that they knew of the kingdom of<br />Kerala in the South India as seen from the Second Edict.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>

<p>(6) The Rivers flowing in the close vicinity of Kodungallur of Kerala<br />(Chera)</p>
<p>Among all the rivers flowing across Kerala, the longest river is the<br />present Periyar river, flowing in to the Kodungallur Lagoon (Lagoon - a<br />lake fed by sea water). The present Periyar of Kerala was originally<br />known as the Periyaru meaning the big river (in Tamil). However it's<br />original name was not merely Periyaru, but was known as the "Chulliyam<br />Periyaru" of Cheras.</p>
<p>We see many references to different rivers in India with such name<br />combinations namely as Gangai Periyaru, Kaviri Periyaru, Pennai<br />Periyaru, Vaikai Periyaru etc. Hence from the foregoing it is clear the<br />Periyaru has been used in the sense of "Periya Aru" (in Tamil) meaning<br />the big River, with their actual names prefixed to the term Periyaru.<br />Hence it is clear that "Chulliyam" was the original name of the Periyaru<br />of Kerala, which the poet states belonged to the Chera kings (Cheralar).</p>
<p>Also there is another river named Pullut Phuza (Pullut River) which<br />flows from the north of Kerala passing adjacent to the present<br />Kodungallur region - the former Vanchi nagar, and then turns around this<br />region to the west and falls into the same Kodungallur Lagoon. The<br />Pullut Phuza (Phuza in Malayalam = River) was the former Aan Porunai<br />River(in Tamil) mentioned in many Tamil Literary works of the early<br />period, and positively confirmed by Silappathikaram as surrounding the<br />Vanji nagar is of much importance in the Kerala (Chera history).</p>
<p>There is the third river named Chalakkudi which joins with Periyar near<br />present Chowkakadavu and then falls into the Kodungallur Lagoon. From<br />the Kodungallur Lagoon the confluence of these three rivers falls in to<br />the nearby sea at the present Alikode (Aalikkodu), the former region of<br />the famed seaport city of Musiri.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>
<p>In Ahananooru the rivers Chulliyam, Kaviri, Pennai of south India, and<br />Ganga of north India are referred to as Periyaaru.</p>

<p>(7) The Musiri the earliest known Seaport city of Kerala near<br />Kodungallur</p>
<p>The Musiri is the earliest known seaport city of the Kerala<br />(Chera-Kothai) kings at the estuary of the confluence of three rivers,<br />at the present Alikode in west Kerala adjacent to the sea.</p>
<p>The scenic description of the Musiri port is described in the<br />contemporary period Tamil Literary work Puranaanooru as follows: :</p>
<p>"?..With the fish piled up and the paddy heaped within the elevated<br />house of boats (ambi) with the pepper bags (too) within this house<br />(outer) fortification, brought the load to the shore of the sea where<br />the seaport Musiri was situated possibly along the rivers (undoubtedly<br />along Aan Porunai, Chulliam Periyaru, and Chalakkudi), (where) the ships<br />with gifts of gold (too) brought to shore by small ships (thoni) ?<br />(thus) the products of hills and the seas unloaded and distributed to<br />those who came there (for trading) was the Kuttuvan's Musiri (port)<br />with noise of the roaring sea?..".</p>
<p>The Greeks and the Romans with the discovery of the favourable wind<br />named "Hippalus" (in A.D.47), travelled to the nearest seaport of India<br />namely the Musiri in much quicker time of forty days from the Ocelis<br />port of Arabia.</p>
<p>The first known reference to Musiri from the external sources comes from<br />the Roman Historian named Pliny in A.D.77, who refers to Musiri as a<br />seat of goverment under the rule of Chera kings was a seaport city at<br />the height of prosperity frequented by ships and was of leading<br />importance. Muziris of the Cheras abounds in ships sent there with<br />note this king was the Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan (A.D.74 - 132).</p>
<p>Further reference to Muziris is made in A.D.100 by a Greek historian<br />named Periplus who states "?.Musiri was not a desirable place of<br />call, with pirates being in the neighbourhood who occupied a place<br />called Nitrias (the Naruvu as known to Tamils north of Musiri occupied<br />by Kadambar) and besides it is not well supplied with wares for traffic.<br />Ships besides anchor at a great distance from the shore and cargoes have<br />to be landed and shipped by employing boats. During this time the<br />Caelobothras (Keralaputhra) was the sovereign of that<br />country?.."</p>
<p>The Musiri being the seaport city of the Chera kingdom is also confirmed<br />by Ptolemy in the year A.D.150. He refers to ".....Musiri Emporium as a<br />sea port city that was ruled at that time by Kerobothras....." which is<br />a corruption of Cheraputhras or Keralaputhras, as found in the Asokan<br />Inscriptions, meaning the people of Kerala (Chera) country.</p>
<p>Further from the Ptolemy's geographical cordinates it is clear that the<br />Muziris emporium a seaport city was situated immediately north and at<br />the mouth of the Pseudostomos river, identified as the "specific<br />reference" to the "AanPorunai river" (present Pullut river), entering<br />the sea as a confluence of three rivers the other two being the Periyar<br />and the Chalakkudi rivers.</p>
<p>Hence the sea port city of the Chera Nadu of the first and second<br />century A.D. known as Musiri could be very positively located at the<br />river (mouth) estuary of the confluence of these three rivers the<br />principal river among them being the Periyar river, where they meet the<br />sea around the present Alikode region near the Kodungallur.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references</p>
<p>"?.Kothai Musiriyar Koman....."</p>
<p>Muththolaayiram ? section 3 (on Cheras), verse 116</p>
<p>"?..Meen noduththu nelkuvai yi<br />misai ambiyin manai marukkunthu<br />manaikkuvai iya kari moodaiyal<br />kali summaiya karai kalak kurunthu<br />kalam thantha pot parisam<br />kalithoniyaan, karaiserkunthu<br />malai thaaramum kadal thaaramum<br />thalai peithu, varunarkku eeyum<br />punal am kallin polanthaar Kuttuvan<br />mulanghu kadal mulavin Musiri anna....."</p>

If the wind called Hippalus be blowing Muziris<br />the nearest mart of India can be reached in forty days. It is not a<br />desirable place of call, pirates being in the neighbourhood who occupied<br />a place called Nitrias, and besides it is not well supplied with wares<br />for traffic. Ships besides anchor at a great distance from the shore and<br />cargoes have to be landed and shipped by employing boats.

To the kingdom under<br />the sway of Ceprobotras, Tyndis is subject, a village of great note<br />situate near the sea. Muziris which pertains to the same realm is a city<br />at the height of prosperity, frequented as it is by ships. It lies near<br />a river at a distance from Tyndis of 500 stadia whether measured from<br />river to river or by the length of the sea voyage and it is 20 stadia<br />distant from the mouth of its own river. The distance of Nelcynda from<br />Muziris is also nearly 500 stadia whether measured from river to river<br />or by sea voyage but it belongs to Pandion.</p>

It is located on a river distant from<br />Tyndis by river and sea five hundred stadia, and up the river from the<br />shore 20 stadia. Nelcynda is distant from Muziris by river and sea five<br />hundred stadia and is of another kingdom Pandian..."</p>

<p>(8) Subsequent invasion of Musiri by the Pandiyan king Cheliyan</p>
<p>come to know that the Pandiyan Cheliyan once raided the ancient estuary<br />(of Periyar) at Musiri (seaport city), where the warlike Cheliyan<br />(Pandiyan king) with tall strong elephant surrounded (the city) to the<br />shock (of the inhabitants) raided in severe battle, and took (to<br />himself) the statue.</p>
<p>Among two other poems from "Ahanaanooru", one confirms that the<br />Pandiyan (king) Cheliyan raided the city of Musiri at the estuary<br />(Musiri munthurai), while the other refers he having won the Cheral<br />(possibly ruling Musiri), and in both the Cheliyan has been referred to<br />as having "koi suvar puravi kodi ther" meaning the<br />`Cheliyan with chariot having horses of trimmed mane and flag'.<br />Hence the the Pandiyan king Cheliyan was no other than the "Thalai<br />Alanganaththu seru ventra Cheliyan" as seen in one of the latter two<br />poems of Ahanaanooru.</p>
<p>It is noted that there is no reference in these poems to him capturing<br />the Karur or Vanji in the same raid, being the capital city of the Chera<br />kings. This indicates the purpose of the raid by Pandiyan Cheliyan was<br />to `secure to himself a Statue'("padimam vaviya") from the<br />seaport city of Musiri, that has been of much value and importance to<br />him.</p>
<p>At the time of this raid the Kadamba king (known for their pirate<br />activities) named Erumaiyooran ruled from Naravu north of Musiri.</p>
<p>This above are confirmed by the following references</p>
<p>"........valam elu Musiri arrpu ela valaiyee<br />arum samam kadanthu padimam vaviya<br />nedu nal yanai adu por Cheliyan......"</p>

<p>(9) The Karuvur the earliest known inland capital city of Kerala near<br />Kodungallur</p>
<p>The inland capital of the earliest known Kerala (Chera) kings was the<br />Karuvur also known as Karur. (The latter is also spelt as Karoor with<br />the same pronounciation). This capital city was located at the present<br />Karuvapadna, a little distance north from the Kodungallur Lagoon along<br />the present Pullut river (former Aan Porunai river) and on the right<br />side of it near the present Vallivattom bridge.</p>
<p>It is clearly evident that the present Karuvapadna and the region<br />surrounding same were the former Karuvur Pattinam of the Cheras, which<br />is confirmed by the very fact the regions in and around Karuvapadna are<br />known even today as Karoor Paadam, Karoorpadna junction, Karoorpadna<br />Kulam etc. This was undoubtedly the ancient Karur City, and is confirmed<br />in the above reference that it was the royal seat meaning the capital<br />city of the Kerobothras (the Keralas or Cheras).</p>
<p>It is also shown in the Ptolemy's map that it was located a little<br />interior but not far from Musiri, and on the right side of the river<br />Pseudostomos river. Further we are aware that all three rivers namely<br />the Periyar, the Chalakudi, and the Pullut river that meets at the<br />Kodungallur Lagoon and falling into the sea, are not shown in Ptolemy's<br />map. Only one river is shown in same, and is also mentioned that the<br />Karoura - the royal seat of Kerobothras was on its right side adjacent<br />to it.</p>
<p>is clear that the river shown in his map is no other than the "Aan<br />Porunai river" the present Pulut Puzha (not the river Periyaru or the<br />river Chalakudi), which flows adjacent to and on the right side of the<br />present Kodungallur (the region of Vanji Nagar - the later capital of<br />Cheras), and a little distance upstream in the northernly direction it<br />is seen that the "Aan Porunai river" flows adjacent to and on<br />the left side of the present Karuvapadna the region of Karuvur - the<br />former capital of Cheras. The Ptolemy's map refers to it as<br />"Carura Regia Cerobothri" - the Karur kingdom of Cheras. This<br />reference of Ptolemy on Karuvur, is the first evidence available to us<br />presently in any historical or literary documents of that period, as<br />being the captal city of Cheras.</p>
<p>that Karuvur was adjacent to the Aan Porunai River. Karuvur served as<br />the earlier interior capital of Cheras, while Musiri remained the<br />seaport capital during this period.</p>
<p>The Ships coming to then Chera Nadu from foreign countries anchored at<br />Musiri harbour the first known seaport city of Cheras which stretched<br />from the seafront near present Alikode upto the of Kodungallur Lagoon.<br />Just little beyond on the north-east of this lagoon along the Pullut<br />River (Aan Porunai river) was the region known as the "Karuvur<br />Munthurai" (Mun Thurai = Harbour Front : Harbour is a section of a<br />river or sea opposite a landmass region used for parking or harbouring -<br />small boats and Thonis or large ships, and Kalangal) which is referred<br />to in the Ahanaanooru as "?.more than the sand (crystals) on the<br />high bunds of clear water Aan Porunai river at the Harbour front of the<br />prosperous and wonderous large city of Karuvur of the Kothai (Chera)<br />king, with the strong elephant and tall Chariot?.."</p>
<p>the term "Munthurai" is used to mean the "harbour<br />front". The harbour front of Kaviri river - refers to Poompuhar or<br />Kaviripoompattinam the seaport city of Cholas, the "harbour<br />front" at Kotkai - refers to the Kotkai seaport city of Pandiyas,<br />harbour front at Musiri - refers to the Musiri seaport city of Cheras<br />(Keralas).</p>
<p>Hence it is clear that there was also a "harbour front" opposite<br />Karuvur near the present Vallivattom bridge just beyond the Kodungaloor<br />lagoon along the Pullut River the former Aan Porunai river, up to which<br />it was navigable for small boats and ships, with goods from Musiri port<br />to the interior capital the Karuvur.</p>
<p>Chera king who rose on the throne of Karuvur and ruled Chera Nadu was<br />Koperum Cheral Irumporai.</p>
<p>Important Note : The present Karuvur region near Thirutchiraappalli in<br />TamilNadu, was one of the earliest capital city of the Cholas long<br />before Uraiyur. Some of the Chera kings who became powerfull during the<br />early and medieval periods, also captured this Karuvur city from the<br />Cholas and ruled over same (leaving some inscriptions on their<br />endowments made during that time to the temples in this region), but<br />many times lost same back to Cholas. The Karuvur or Karur of Cheras and<br />that of Cholas are two different entities.</p>
<p>that the Ministers after the death of the Chola king at Karuvur met at a<br />region known as Kalumalam and gave a (trained) Elephant with a garland<br />and instigated it to select by garlanding the next successor to the<br />Chola throne. Accordingly the Elephant went to the city of Karuvur and<br />garlanded on the very young Karikatcholan who was accepted and crowned<br />as the next Chola king at Karuvur, This traditional story is referred to<br />in Palamoli Naanooru as follows.</p>
<p>Further in the Periyapuraanam in the chapter on Puhal Chola Naayanaar a<br />reference again confirms beyond doubt the Karuvur at Thirutchirapalli<br />district was the early traditional capital of the Cholas and not that of<br />Cheras</p>
<p>In the above `further evidence' is thrown to prove that Karuvur<br />at present Thirutchi was the the ancient capital of Cholas and not of<br />Cheras by the mere fact the king of the "kuda pulam" the Cherar<br />brought tributaries to the Chola at Karuvur a procession of tall<br />elephants.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references</p>
<p>The Ptolemy's geography states that among the inland cities of Limryke<br />was the :</p>

<p>(10) The change of capital city from Karuvur to Vanji</p>
<p>The Karuvur didnot last too long as the interior capital city of the<br />Chera Country, possibly because of the geographical location of same.<br />When we have a close look at the present Karuvapadna - north of<br />Kodungallur, we note many water inroads in the region of the main city.<br />This was possibly caused by the flooding of Karuvur "harbour<br />front" region by the waters of Aan Porunai River (Pullut River)<br />during monsoon times, and having more water inroads geographically and<br />making the city more vulnerable, found it necessary for the Cheras to<br />shift their capital city to a more habitable land area on the left side<br />of the Aan Porunai River, but keeping in the close proximity to their<br />seaport city the Musiri, and this region was named as the Vanji Nagar<br />which became the subsequent interior capital city of the Cheras possibly<br />from the first century B.C.</p>
<p>Karuvur and Vanji were not the exactly the same location, but a little<br />distant apart and both being at different locations on either side of<br />the Aan Porunai river (Pullut river) as noted from Ahanaanooru and<br />Silappathikaram.</p>
<p>However the distance being not too far apart from each other made the<br />poets who composed the Tamil Nihandus (ancient Tamil dictionaries)<br />namely the Chudamani Nihandu, Pingala Nihandu etc to mention in their<br />compositions that Karuvur and Vanji are the same.</p>
<p>The Tamil Literary Work Puraranaannoru states the Vanji Nagar city walls<br />was adjacent to the river Aan Porunai (present Pullut river) the waves<br />of which were striking this wall. The Tamil works such<br />Sirrupaanaartrupadai, Silapathikaaram, Puranaanooru confirms the river<br />Aan Porunai was flowing sourrounding by the side of Vanji Nagar. The<br />Cheras were also known as Kuda Naadaan and Vanjikomaan and Kothai kings.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>
<p>"........Selvak Kadungo Vaaliyaathan<br />ennaath thevvar uyarkudai paniththu ivan<br />viduvar maatho nedithe ni.......<br />pul elai Vanji pura mathil alaikkum<br />kal en Porunai malinum aangkan<br />pal uur sutriya kalani<br />ellam vilaiyum nellinum palave....."</p>

<p>(11) The first Kerala (Chera) Tamil empire of the first century A.D.</p>
<p>The greatest among the Kerala (Chera) kings throughout the Tamil and<br />Malayalam periods of the Kerala History was the Tamil Chera king<br />Imayavaramban Nedun Cheralathan, and his son Cheran Chenguttuvan.</p>
<p>Imayavramban Nedun Cheralathan was the Tamil Chera king who ruled from<br />Vanji Nager (Kodungallur) during the period A.D.74 -132. He was the son<br />of the Chera king Uthiyan Cheralathan and Queen Nallini daughter of the<br />Kerala chieften Veliyan Venmaal. He ruled for 58 years.</p>
<p>He became very powerful and went on a expedition towards north of India<br />and defeated and won over many Aryan kings in the central and northern<br />India, and carved the Chera royal emblem the "bow" on the<br />Himalayan mountain. He also turned his attention on the Indo-Greek king<br />(Yavanar) ruling in then Bactria - a region now covered within the<br />present Pakistan, captured the king and on he agreeing to pay tributes<br />handed his kingdom back to him, and returned back to his kingdom with<br />tributes of diamonds and other valuables from this king.</p>
<p>However he maintained good relations with the other Tamil kingdoms of<br />then South India, namely the Cholas and the Pandiyas. His authority<br />extended over many kingdoms between the Himalayas up to Kanyakumari down<br />south and thus he could be classified as the emperor of the first Kerala<br />(Chera) empire.</p>
<p>Imayavaramban Nedun Cheralathan was succeeded by his able son Cheran<br />Senguttuvan on the Chera throne inheriting the vast empire from his<br />father, and ruled from the Vanji Nagar during the period A.D.132 -187.<br />He was the son of the Chera king Nedun Cheralathan and Queen Manakkilli<br />the daughter of the Chola king Nedumudikkilli ruling Chola Nadu from<br />Kaviripoompattinam (Poompuhar).</p>
<p>Cheran Chenguttuvan in a battle at Kongu Nadu was assisted by the forces<br />of the Cholas and Pandiyas. He ruled for 55 years.</p>
<p>He had a younger brother who abdicated being the Chera prince, and<br />became a Jain Monk and lived in Kunavaayil Kottam the temple at the<br />eastern entrance of the Vanji Nagar.</p>
<p>With the death of his father Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan in A.D.132<br />he set out on an expedition towards North India with his mother<br />Manakkilli to enable her perform the religious rights to her husband and<br />have a holy bath at the river Ganges.</p>
<p>On his way to North India he had to meet the stiff resistance from some<br />of the north Indian kings before he reached the Ganges river, eventhough<br />his father defeated these kings earlier and exacted tributes from them.</p>
<p>He thus again defeated the Konkans, Kalingas, Karnatakas, Bangalas,<br />Gangas, the Katiyas with the Aryans of the North, who obstructed his<br />Gangetic expedition.</p>
<p>The greatness of these two kings namely the father and the son can be<br />seen from the following references in the great Tamil Literary Works of<br />the contemperary period.</p>
<p>".....singing the glory of the king who ruled the country of the<br />Yavanas of hard words, the solid big stone (Himalayan mountain) and the<br />southern Kumari, the one who protects the fame of the countries of Bow,<br />Kayal Fish and Tiger (emblems of the Chera, Chola and<br />Pandiyas)?."</p>

<p>".....the Cheralathan who reigned the world with one rule (from) the<br />Kumari (Kanyakumari) to the northern Himalayas, (by) the daughter of the<br />Chola of shining Solar race who gave birth to the son who, won the Kongu<br />king at the redish battle field, and who went to the shores of the great<br />river Gangai......"</p>

          The great Significance of Kodungallur of Kerala        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>The great Significance of Kodungallur of Kerala in the history of Kerala<br />&amp; Tamil Nadu : Part - 1</p>
<p>A Prelude to the Research Article on Kodungallur</p>
<p>Kodungallur is a region in the southern tip of the present Thrissur<br />district of Kerala State, South India - adjoining the Arabian sea. Today<br />it remains a city of less commercial and industrial activities and<br />modern buildings. However it has centres of religious worship, namely<br />the Temples, Churches and Mosques.</p>
<p>Kodungallur was also known as Cranganore during the English occupation<br />of the region. It could be placed as the first region of Kerala "of much<br />historical importance", while Thiruvananthapuram the present capital of<br />Kerala could only take the third place, while Kollam takes the second<br />place.</p>
<p>However due to less developments in this region, it has not attracted<br />the attention of many Keralites who are still not aware of "the great<br />historical significance of this region in Kerala history". This could be<br />the possible reason why the Kerala Map Printers too show the name of<br />Kodungallur in tiny letters in their Kerala Maps, and in some Maps it is<br />not shown at all.</p>
<p>The objective of this Article is do give a deep insight into the actual<br />history of Kodungallur hitherto not known to many, and to highlight the<br />great significance of this region supported by evidences.</p>
<p>(1) The two eras of Kerala History</p>
<p>The history of the present Kerala State - South India could be divided<br />into two eras, one ranging from ancient times to the end of the twelth<br />century (A.D.1200) and classified as the Tamil Period of it's History,<br />and the other ranging from the beginning of the thirteenth century<br />(A.D.1201) to this date and classified as the Malayalam Period of it's<br />History.</p>
<p>(2) The traditional geographical boundries of Kerala</p>
<p>Kerala is the Sanskritised version of the Tamil "Chera", and the region<br />of the Chera country had as it's boundries the "Kolikkodu" in the west,<br />"Palani" in the north, "South Kaasi"(Ten Kasi) in the east, and the<br />seafront in the south covering eighty Kavatham of land (Kavatham - a<br />land measure).</p>
<p>Note:The above is better understood, if taken as the Chera country<br />encompassed within the outer boundries Kolikkodu, Palani, Ten Kasi and<br />Sea (south beyond Kovalam).</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following reference:</p>
<p>".....Vadakku thisai Palani vaan Keel Then Kaasi Kudakku thisai<br />Kolikkodaam - Kadatkaraiyil<br />oramo Thetkkahum ulla En Pathi Kavatham<br />Sera Naatu ellai ena seppu....."</p>
<p>Perunthohai by M.Ragavaiyangar, Verse - 2091, Madurai Thamil Sangam<br />Publication 1935 - 1936</p>
<p>(3) The Kings of early Kerala</p>
<p>eastern part of the South India was ruled by Tamil Hindu kings, and many<br />Tamil Literary works of the early and medieval periods of both Kerala<br />and Tamil Nadu refer to them as the Chera kings.</p>
<p>The region of the former Chera country was encompassed within the<br />present Kerala state, while the regions of the former Chola and Pandiya<br />Countries were encompassed within the present Tamil Nadu State, and were<br />known in the early days as the "Muth Thamil Nadu" (three Tamil<br />Countries).</p>
<p>These three Tamil countries from their early days had as their royal<br />emblems the Bow (Chera), Fish (Pandiya), and Tiger (Chola) respectively<br />in their flags.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>
<p>"........vada thisai marungin mannarkku ellaam then Thamil Naattu chelu<br />Vil, Kayal, Puli manthalai aetra varaiha eengu"......."</p>
<p>Silappathikaaram - by Ilango Adihal, Vanji Kaandam, Kaatchi Kaathai<br />U.V.Swaminatha Iyer edition</p>
<p>".......mudi udai venthar moovarullum<br />kudathisai aalum kotram kuntraa<br />aaram maarpit Chera kulathu uthiththor....."</p>
<p>Silappathikaaram - by Ilango Adihal, Vanji Kaandam - Katturai.<br />U.V.Swaminatha Iyer edition</p>
<p>(4) Earliest references to Kerala in early Indian Literature</p>
<p>The earliest known references to the Kerala (Chera Nadu) in the Indian<br />Literature are found in the original Sanskrit epics - namely the<br />Ramaayana of poet Vaalmihi, and the Mahaabhaaratha.of poet Viyaasar.</p>
<p>In Ramaayana it is noted Sukkrivan requesting Anuman to go in search of<br />Sita in the countries in the southern regions of India among the Kerala,<br />Pundhara, Chola and Pandiya countries.</p>
<p>In Mahaabhaaratha we find Sanjayan while mentioning the countries in the<br />south of India to king Thirutharastra, refers to Kerala along with<br />Andhra, Karnataka and Chola. Mahabharatha further states the Keralas<br />along with the Pandiyas and Cholas fought on the side of the Pandavas in<br />the Mahabharatha war.</p>
<p>There are `many' other references to Keralas in the Viyasa's<br />Mahabharatha. (Refer to my thread titled "The references to Tamil<br />dynasties and countries in the Mahabharatha" in this same Website)</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>
<p>"...sarvam eve anupashyata tathaiva Aandhraan ca Pundran ca Colaan,<br />Paandyaan, Keralaan....."</p>
<p>Ramayana - by Valmiki, Kishkinda Kanda,Volume 4, Chapter 41, Lines 12</p>
<p>"??Sanjaya said, listen to me O king (Thiratharastra).......to the<br />names of the provinces as I mention them. They are.......the<br />Keralas......the Andhras......"</p>
<p>".....There are other kingdoms O bull of Bharatha's race, in the south.<br />They are the Dravidas, the Keralas......the Karanatakas......the<br />Cholas......"</p>
<p>Mahabharatha ? by Viyasa, Bhisma Parva, Page 21&amp; 22</p>
<p>"........When that host was being thus struck and slain by heroic<br />warriors, the Parthas headed by Vrikodara advance against us. They<br />consisted of Dhrishtayumna and Sikhandin, and the five sons of Draupadi,<br />and the Prabhadrakes, and Satyaki, and Chekitana with the Dravida<br />forces, and the Pandyas, the Cholas, and the Keralas, surrounded by a<br />mighty array,......".</p>
<p>Mahabharatha ? by Viyasa, Karna Parva, Page 25.</p>
<p>(5) The Confederacy of the Kerala (Chera), Chola and Pandiya</p>
<p>In South India there has been a confederacy of the Tamil kingdoms<br />(Tamira Countries) of Chera, Chola, and Pandiya (Muth Tamil Nadu) to<br />jointly prevent the kings of the north and central India from invading<br />their countries. This confederacy that existed for 113 years from<br />B.C.283 was broken by king Karavela of Kalinga in the year B.C.170,<br />which was a potential threat to his own kingdom.</p>
<p>The Tamil kingdoms of Chera, Chola and Pandiya of that period, ensured<br />the unity of the southern Tamil Nadu of that period, even at the times<br />of their individual invasions of the northern Ariyan kings. The Ariyan<br />kings too recognised the unity, and the strength of the Tamil kings and<br />have referred to them as the kings of the Tamil Nadu in the south, who<br />have carved their royal emblems the Bow, Tiger and Fish individually on<br />the mountain range of the Himalayas, at different times.</p>
<p>The Kerala kings too in their North Indian expeditions, considered it as<br />a great pride to have carved their emblem the Bow on the Himalayas, and<br />having seen the Thamilakam (Chera, Chola &amp; Pandiya) of that period bound<br />by seas all round, stressing on their unity.</p>
<p>This confederacy of the three southern Tamil kingdoms the Kerala<br />(Chera), Chola and Pandiya, prevented the Maurya Emperor Asoka too from<br />conquereing their countries in Southern India. This could have been the<br />reason why when his domains extended as far as Mysore, he has referred<br />in his Second Rock Edict that the Kerala (Chera), Chola, and Pandiya<br />countries as being beyond his domains. However King Asoka were<br />successful in penetrating the three Tamil countries as far as<br />Tamiraparni river in south Pandiya Nadu, with his Buddhist Dhamma<br />religious mission</p>
<p>In the above edict the Keralas are mentioned as the Keralaputras, that<br />is the Putras of Kerala, meaning the sons of the soil of Kerala. From<br />the above it is very clear that the Keralas were known to the people of<br />North India also during the period of the Maurya Emperor Asoka, who<br />ruled the Maghada kingdom from B.C.273 - 236.</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Edict of Asokan period has only mentioned of the Cholas<br />and Pandyas, but it is already clear that they knew of the kingdom of<br />Kerala in the South India as seen from the Second Edict.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>
<p>"............vada Aariyar padai kadanththu<br />then Thamil Naadu orungu kaana........"</p>

<p>Hathigumpha Inscription of Kharavela of Kalinga (B.C.170)<br />Epigraphia Indica - Vol. XX, 86-89.</p>
<p>(6) The Rivers flowing in the close vicinity of Kodungallur of Kerala<br />(Chera)</p>
<p>Among all the rivers flowing across Kerala, the longest river is the<br />present Periyar river, flowing in to the Kodungallur Lagoon (Lagoon - a<br />lake fed by sea water). The present Periyar of Kerala was originally<br />known as the Periyaru meaning the big river (in Tamil). However it's<br />original name was not merely Periyaru, but was known as the "Chulliyam<br />Periyaru" of Cheras.</p>
<p>We see many references to different rivers in India with such name<br />combinations namely as Gangai Periyaru, Kaviri Periyaru, Pennai<br />Periyaru, Vaikai Periyaru etc. Hence from the foregoing it is clear the<br />Periyaru has been used in the sense of "Periya Aru" (in Tamil) meaning<br />the big River, with their actual names prefixed to the term Periyaru.<br />Hence it is clear that "Chulliyam" was the original name of the Periyaru<br />of Kerala, which the poet states belonged to the Chera kings (Cheralar).</p>
<p>Also there is another river named Pullut Phuza (Pullut River) which<br />flows from the north of Kerala passing adjacent to the present<br />Kodungallur region - the former Vanchi nagar, and then turns around this<br />region to the west and falls into the same Kodungallur Lagoon. The<br />Pullut Phuza (Phuza in Malayalam = River) was the former Aan Porunai<br />River(in Tamil) mentioned in many Tamil Literary works of the early<br />period, and positively confirmed by Silappathikaram as surrounding the<br />Vanji nagar is of much importance in the Kerala (Chera history).</p>
<p>There is the third river named Chalakkudi which joins with Periyar near<br />present Chowkakadavu and then falls into the Kodungallur Lagoon. From<br />the Kodungallur Lagoon the confluence of these three rivers falls in to<br />the nearby sea at the present Alikode (Aalikkodu), the former region of<br />the famed seaport city of Musiri.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>
<p>In Ahananooru the rivers Chulliyam, Kaviri, Pennai of south India, and<br />Ganga of north India are referred to as Periyaaru.</p>
<p>"....Cheralar Chulliam Periyaartru vennurai<br />kalanga.......................................................valam elu<br />Musiri"</p>

<p>(7) The Musiri the earliest known Seaport city of Kerala near<br />Kodungallur</p>
<p>The Musiri is the earliest known seaport city of the Kerala<br />(Chera-Kothai) kings at the estuary of the confluence of three rivers,<br />at the present Alikode in west Kerala adjacent to the sea.</p>
<p>The scenic description of the Musiri port is described in the<br />contemporary period Tamil Literary work Puranaanooru as follows: :</p>
<p>"?..With the fish piled up and the paddy heaped within the elevated<br />house of boats (ambi) with the pepper bags (too) within this house<br />(outer) fortification, brought the load to the shore of the sea where<br />the seaport Musiri was situated possibly along the rivers (undoubtedly<br />along Aan Porunai, Chulliam Periyaru, and Chalakkudi), (where) the ships<br />with gifts of gold (too) brought to shore by small ships (thoni) ?<br />(thus) the products of hills and the seas unloaded and distributed to<br />those who came there (for trading) was the Kuttuvan's Musiri (port)<br />with noise of the roaring sea?..".</p>
<p>The Greeks and the Romans with the discovery of the favourable wind<br />named "Hippalus" (in A.D.47), travelled to the nearest seaport of India<br />namely the Musiri in much quicker time of forty days from the Ocelis<br />port of Arabia.</p>
<p>The first known reference to Musiri from the external sources comes from<br />the Roman Historian named Pliny in A.D.77, who refers to Musiri as a<br />seat of goverment under the rule of Chera kings was a seaport city at<br />the height of prosperity frequented by ships and was of leading<br />importance. Muziris of the Cheras abounds in ships sent there with<br />note this king was the Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan (A.D.74 - 132).</p>
<p>Further reference to Muziris is made in A.D.100 by a Greek historian<br />named Periplus who states "?.Musiri was not a desirable place of<br />call, with pirates being in the neighbourhood who occupied a place<br />called Nitrias (the Naruvu as known to Tamils north of Musiri occupied<br />by Kadambar) and besides it is not well supplied with wares for traffic.<br />Ships besides anchor at a great distance from the shore and cargoes have<br />to be landed and shipped by employing boats. During this time the<br />Caelobothras (Keralaputhra) was the sovereign of that<br />country?.."</p>
<p>The Musiri being the seaport city of the Chera kingdom is also confirmed<br />by Ptolemy in the year A.D.150. He refers to ".....Musiri Emporium as a<br />sea port city that was ruled at that time by Kerobothras....." which is<br />a corruption of Cheraputhras or Keralaputhras, as found in the Asokan<br />Inscriptions, meaning the people of Kerala (Chera) country.</p>
<p>Further from the Ptolemy's geographical cordinates it is clear that the<br />Muziris emporium a seaport city was situated immediately north and at<br />the mouth of the Pseudostomos river, identified as the "specific<br />reference" to the "AanPorunai river" (present Pullut river), entering<br />the sea as a confluence of three rivers the other two being the Periyar<br />and the Chalakkudi rivers.</p>
<p>Hence the sea port city of the Chera Nadu of the first and second<br />century A.D. known as Musiri could be very positively located at the<br />river (mouth) estuary of the confluence of these three rivers the<br />principal river among them being the Periyar river, where they meet the<br />sea around the present Alikode region near the Kodungallur.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references</p>
<p>"?.Kothai Musiriyar Koman....."</p>
<p>Muththolaayiram ? section 3 (on Cheras), verse 116</p>

If the wind called Hippalus be blowing Muziris<br />the nearest mart of India can be reached in forty days. It is not a<br />desirable place of call, pirates being in the neighbourhood who occupied<br />a place called Nitrias, and besides it is not well supplied with wares<br />for traffic. Ships besides anchor at a great distance from the shore and<br />cargoes have to be landed and shipped by employing boats. At the time I<br />was writing this Caelobothras was the sovereign of that country......"</p>

Muziris which pertains to the same realm is a city<br />at the height of prosperity, frequented as it is by ships. It lies near<br />a river at a distance from Tyndis of 500 stadia whether measured from<br />river to river or by the length of the sea voyage and it is 20 stadia<br />distant from the mouth of its own river. The distance of Nelcynda from<br />Muziris is also nearly 500 stadia whether measured from river to river<br />or by sea voyage but it belongs to Pandion.</p>

It is located on a river distant from<br />Tyndis by river and sea five hundred stadia, and up the river from the<br />shore 20 stadia. Nelcynda is distant from Muziris by river and sea five<br />hundred stadia and is of another kingdom Pandian..."</p>

<p>(8) Subsequent invasion of Musiri by the Pandiyan king Cheliyan</p>
<p>come to know that the Pandiyan Cheliyan once raided the ancient estuary<br />(of Periyar) at Musiri (seaport city), where the warlike Cheliyan<br />(Pandiyan king) with tall strong elephant surrounded (the city) to the<br />shock (of the inhabitants) raided in severe battle, and took (to<br />himself) the statue.</p>
<p>Among two other poems from "Ahanaanooru", one confirms that the<br />Pandiyan (king) Cheliyan raided the city of Musiri at the estuary<br />(Musiri munthurai), while the other refers he having won the Cheral<br />(possibly ruling Musiri), and in both the Cheliyan has been referred to<br />as having "koi suvar puravi kodi ther" meaning the `Cheliyan<br />with chariot having horses of trimmed mane and flag'. Hence the the<br />Pandiyan king Cheliyan was no other than the "Thalai Alanganaththu<br />seru ventra Cheliyan" as seen in one of the latter two poems of<br />Ahanaanooru.</p>
<p>It is noted that there is no reference in these poems to him capturing<br />the Karur or Vanji in the same raid, being the capital city of the Chera<br />kings. This indicates the purpose of the raid by Pandiyan Cheliyan was<br />to `secure to himself a Statue'(padimam vaviya) from the seaport<br />city of Musiri, that has been of much value and importance to him.</p>
<p>At the time of this raid the Kadamba king (known for their pirate<br />activities) named Erumaiyooran ruled from Naravu north of Musiri.</p>
<p>This above are confirmed by the following references</p>
<p>"........valam elu Musiri arrpu ela valaiyee<br />arum samam kadanthu padimam vaviya<br />nedu nal yanai adu por Cheliyan......"</p>

<p>(9) The Karuvur the earliest known inland capital city of Kerala near<br />Kodungallur</p>
<p>The inland capital of the earliest known Kerala (Chera) kings was the<br />Karuvur also known as Karur. (The latter is also spelt as Karoor with<br />the same pronounciation). This capital city was located at the present<br />Karuvapadna, a little distance north from the Kodungallur Lagoon along<br />the present Pullut river (former Aan Porunai river) and on the right<br />side of it near the present Vallivattom bridge.</p>
<p>It is clearly evident that the present Karuvapadna and the region<br />surrounding same were the former Karuvur Pattinam of the Cheras, which<br />is confirmed by the very fact the regions in and around Karuvapadna are<br />known even today as Karoor Paadam, Karoorpadna junction, Karoorpadna<br />Kulam etc. This was undoubtedly the ancient Karur City, and is confirmed<br />in the above reference that it was the royal seat meaning the capital<br />city of the Kerobothras (the Keralas or Cheras).</p>
<p>It is also shown in the Ptolemy's map that it was located a little<br />interior but not far from Musiri, and on the right side of the river<br />Pseudostomos river. Further we are aware that all three rivers namely<br />the Periyar, the Chalakudi, and the Pullut river that meets at the<br />Kodungallur Lagoon and falling into the sea, are not shown in Ptolemy's<br />map. Only one river is shown in same, and is also mentioned that the<br />Karoura - the royal seat of Kerobothras was on its right side adjacent<br />to it.</p>
<p>is clear that the river shown in his map is no other than the "Aan<br />Porunai river" the present Pulut Puzha (not the river Periyaru or the<br />river Chalakudi), which flows adjacent to and on the right side of the<br />present Kodungallur (the region of Vanji Nagar - the later capital of<br />Cheras), and a little distance upstream in the northernly direction it<br />is seen that the "Aan Porunai river" flows adjacent to and on<br />the left side of the present Karuvapadna the region of Karuvur - the<br />former capital of Cheras. The Ptolemy's map refers to it as<br />"Carura Regia Cerobothri" - the Karur kingdom of Cheras. This<br />reference of Ptolemy on Karuvur, is the first evidence available to us<br />presently in any historical or literary documents of that period, as<br />being the captal city of Cheras.</p>
<p>that Karuvur was adjacent to the Aan Porunai River. Karuvur served as<br />the earlier interior capital of Cheras, while Musiri remained the<br />seaport capital during this period.</p>
<p>The Ships coming to then Chera Nadu from foreign countries anchored at<br />Musiri harbour the first known seaport city of Cheras which stretched<br />from the seafront near present Alikode upto the of Kodungallur Lagoon.<br />Just little beyond on the north-east of this lagoon along the Pullut<br />River (Aan Porunai river) was the region known as the "Karuvur<br />Munthurai" (Mun Thurai = Harbour Front : Harbour is a section of a<br />river or sea opposite a landmass region used for parking or harbouring -<br />small boats and Thonis or large ships, and Kalangal) which is referred<br />to in the Ahanaanooru as "?.more than the sand (crystals) on the<br />high bunds of clear water Aan Porunai river at the Harbour front of the<br />prosperous and wonderous large city of Karuvur of the Kothai (Chera)<br />king, with the strong elephant and tall Chariot?.."</p>
<p>the term "Munthurai" is used to mean the "harbour<br />front". The harbour front of Kaviri river - refers to Poompuhar or<br />Kaviripoompattinam the seaport city of Cholas, the "harbour<br />front" at Kotkai - refers to the Kotkai seaport city of Pandiyas,<br />harbour front at Musiri - refers to the Musiri seaport city of Cheras<br />(Keralas).</p>
<p>Hence it is clear that there was also a "harbour front" opposite<br />Karuvur near the present Vallivattom bridge just beyond the Kodungaloor<br />lagoon along the Pullut River the former Aan Porunai river, up to which<br />it was navigable for small boats and ships, with goods from Musiri port<br />to the interior capital the Karuvur.</p>
<p>Chera king who rose on the throne of Karuvur and ruled Chera Nadu was<br />Koperum Cheral Irumporai.</p>
<p>Important Note : The present Karuvur region near Thirutchiraappalli in<br />TamilNadu, was one of the earliest capital city of the Cholas long<br />before Uraiyur. Some of the Chera kings who became powerfull during the<br />early and medieval periods, also captured this Karuvur city from the<br />Cholas and ruled over same (leaving some inscriptions on their<br />endowments made during that time to the temples in this region), but<br />many times lost same back to Cholas. The Karuvur or Karur of Cheras and<br />that of Cholas are two different entities.</p>
<p>that the Ministers after the death of the Chola king at Karuvur met at a<br />region known as Kalumalam and gave a (trained) Elephant with a garland<br />and instigated it to select by garlanding the next successor to the<br />Chola throne. Accordingly the Elephant went to the city of Karuvur and<br />garlanded on the very young Karikatcholan who was accepted and crowned<br />as the next Chola king at Karuvur, This traditional story is referred to<br />in Palamoli Naanooru as follows.</p>
<p>Further in the Periyapuraanam in the chapter on Puhal Chola Naayanaar a<br />reference again confirms beyond doubt the Karuvur at Thirutchirapalli<br />district was the early traditional capital of the Cholas and not that of<br />Cheras</p>
<p>In the above `further evidence' is thrown to prove that Karuvur<br />at present Thirutchi was the the ancient capital of Cholas and not of<br />Cheras by the mere fact the king of the "kuda pulam" the Cherar<br />brought tributaries to the Chola at Karuvur a procession of tall<br />elephants.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references</p>

<p>(10) The change of capital city from Karuvur to Vanji</p>
<p>The Karuvur didnot last too long as the interior capital city of the<br />Chera Country, possibly because of the geographical location of same.<br />When we have a close look at the present Karuvapadna - north of<br />Kodungallur, we note many water inroads in the region of the main city.<br />This was possibly caused by the flooding of Karuvur "harbour<br />front" region by the waters of Aan Porunai River (Pullut River)<br />during monsoon times, and having more water inroads geographically and<br />making the city more vulnerable, found it necessary for the Cheras to<br />shift their capital city to a more habitable land area on the left side<br />of the Aan Porunai River, but keeping in the close proximity to their<br />seaport city the Musiri, and this region was named as the Vanji Nagar<br />which became the subsequent interior capital city of the Cheras possibly<br />from the first century B.C.</p>
<p>Karuvur and Vanji were not the exactly the same location, but a little<br />distant apart and both being at different locations on either side of<br />the Aan Porunai river (Pullut river) as noted from Ahanaanooru and<br />Silappathikaram.</p>
<p>However the distance being not too far apart from each other made the<br />poets who composed the Tamil Nihandus (ancient Tamil dictionaries)<br />namely the Chudamani Nihandu, Pingala Nihandu etc to mention in their<br />compositions that Karuvur and Vanji are the same.</p>
<p>The Tamil Literary Work Puraranaannoru states the Vanji Nagar city walls<br />was adjacent to the river Aan Porunai (present Pullut river) the waves<br />of which were striking this wall. The Tamil works such<br />Sirrupaanaartrupadai, Silapathikaaram, Puranaanooru confirms the river<br />Aan Porunai was flowing sourrounding by the side of Vanji Nagar. The<br />Cheras were also known as Kuda Naadaan and Vanjikomaan and Kothai kings.</p>
<p>The above are confirmed by the following references:</p>
<p>"........Selvak Kadungo Vaaliyaathan<br />ennaath thevvar uyarkudai paniththu ivan<br />viduvar maatho nedithe ni.......<br />pul elai Vanji pura mathil alaikkum<br />kal en Porunai malinum aangkan<br />pal uur sutriya kalani<br />ellam vilaiyum nellinum palave....."</p>

<p>(11) The first Kerala (Chera) Tamil empire of the first century A.D.</p>
<p>The greatest among the Kerala (Chera) kings throughout the Tamil and<br />Malayalam periods of the Kerala History was the Tamil Chera king<br />Imayavramban Nedun Cheralathan, and his son Cheran Chenguttuvan.</p>
<p>Imayavramban Nedun Cheralathan was the Tamil Chera king who ruled from<br />Vanji Nager (Kodungallur) during the period A.D.74 -132. He was the son<br />of the Chera king Uthiyan Cheralathan and Queen Nallini daughter of the<br />Kerala chieften Veliyan Venmaal. He ruled for 58 years.</p>
<p>He became very powerful and went on a expedition towards north of India<br />and defeated and won over many Aryan kings in the central and northern<br />India, and carved the Chera royal emblem the "bow" on the<br />Himalayan mountain. He also turned his attention on the Indo-Greek king<br />(Yavanar) ruling in then Bactria - a region now covered within the<br />present Pakistan, captured the king and on he agreeing to pay tributes<br />handed his kingdom back to him, and returned back to his kingdom with<br />tributes of diamonds and other valuables from this king.</p>
<p>However he maintained good relations with the other Tamil kingdoms of<br />then South India, namely the Cholas and the Pandiyas. His authority<br />extended over many kingdoms between the Himalayas up to Kanyakumari down<br />south and thus he could be classified as the emperor of the first Kerala<br />(Chera) empire.</p>
<p>Imayavaramban Nedun Cheralathan was succeeded by his able son Cheran<br />Senguttuvan on the Chera throne inheriting the vast empire from his<br />father, and ruled from the Vanji Nagar during the period A.D.132 -187.<br />He was the son of the Chera king Nedun Cheralathan and Queen Manakkilli<br />the daughter of the Chola king Nedumudikkilli ruling Chola Nadu from<br />Kaviripoompattinam (Poompuhar).</p>
<p>Cheran Chenguttuvan in a batlle at Kongu Nadu was assisted by the forces<br />of the Cholas and Pandiyas. He ruled for 55 years.<br />He had a younger brother who abdicated being the Chera prince, and<br />became a Jain Monk and lived in Kunavaayil Kottam (the temple at the<br />eastern entrance of the Vanji Nagar.</p>
<p>With the death of his father Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan in A.D.132<br />he set out on an expedition towards North India with his mother<br />Manakkilli to enable her perform the religious rights to her husband and<br />have a holy bath at the river Ganges.</p>
<p>On his way to North India he had to meet the stiff resistance from some<br />of the north Indian kings before he reached the Ganges river, eventhough<br />his father defeated these kings earlier and exacted tributes from them.</p>
<p>He thus again defeated the Konkans, Kalingas, Karnatakas, Bangalas,<br />Gangas, the Katiyas (Kakatiyas) with the Aryans of the North who<br />obstructed</p>
<p>The greatness of these two kings namely the father and the son can be<br />seen from the following references in the great Tamil Literary Works of<br />the contemperary period.</p>
<p>"singing the glory of the king who ruled the country of the Yavanas<br />of hard words, the solid big stone (mountain) and the southern Kumari,<br />the one who protects the fame of the countries of Bow, Kayal Fish and<br />Tiger (emblems namely the Chera, Chola and Pandiyas?."</p>
<p>"?..Should this be your effort to make all the lands within the<br />seas from all sides of India to be the TamilNadu then there is no one to<br />oppose you??"</p>
<p>the conquered the Ariyan kings to shout and carved the bow (emblem) on<br />the ancient northern mountain range (Himalayas) and and captured the the<br />fierce kings released the Aryan kings from his intense captivity the son<br />given birth by Manakkilli (daughter) of the Chola king, by the the king<br />of Kuda Nadu the Neduncheralathan with victorius flag praised by the<br />Northerners, went through the jungles fast like the arrow for want of<br />stone for carving the statue of Goddess Paththini defeated the chief of<br />the Ariya kings and reached the Gangai with noisy tributaries?"</p>
<p>the Cheralathan who reigned the world with one rule (from) the Kumari<br />(Kanyakumari) to the northern Himalayas, the daughter of the Chola of<br />shining Solar race who gave birth to the son who, won the Kongu king at<br />the redish battle field, and who went to the shores of the great river<br />Gangai?..</p>
<p>the kings within the range of mountains with of granite stone where the<br />God resides as the northern boundry the Himalayas, and the southern<br />Kumari rose with war drums having big battles, defeated the countries of<br />different languages of their ancient beauty and with warriors of<br />fighting fit thy Kuttuva?.</p>
<p>though ruled the prosperous land of the Yavanas (Indo Greeks) of hard<br />words, and 26+<br />d the mountain range of golden shine (Himalayas)</p>
