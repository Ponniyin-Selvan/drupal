This has been a point which has always been left out when<br />the British rule is being defended. Hope somebody can give a good<br />description on this terrible event as a new thread.</p>

<p>    bharathi lived during a time of famines and mass starvation deaths.</p>
<p>    he must have been proud of india today inspite of all our ills and<br />    ailments, corruption and what not.</p>
<p>    we have done extremely well in the path bharathi envisioned for us.</p>

<p>        Hi;         &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We are<br />    discussing his<br />        poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's are one<br />    of our<br />        greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect (among<br />  quite<br />    a few<br />        people), there are statues, places named after the great poet.<br />    School books<br />        have ensured his immortality making sure almost every kid<br />  learns<br />    his poems<br />        during the all important childhood even though they are not too<br />    inclined to<br />        teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i have<br />  left<br />    out a few<br />        more things.</></p>
<p>        Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought to do<br />  for<br />    a poet?<br />        There are instances where somebody has unintentionally been<br />    disrespectful of<br />        this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our hands<br />  to<br />    ensure that<br />        these poems dont fade away with this generation but continue to<br />    inspire more<br />        generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>        Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he was a bad<br />    father and<br />        dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would have<br />    admired his<br />        poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be earning? I<br />    know his<br />        priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but then why<br />  did<br />    he marry?!<br />        Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had commited<br />    suicide and<br />        Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been discussin<br />    him!! I<br />        think it is his wife who has not been getting the accolades she<br />    deserves!!!</p>

<p>          Being a poet, the options to earn are very few in those days.<br />    There is<br />          no<br />          film industry to earn and live in luxary. He has to sing to<br />  the<br />    kings<br />          and zamindars of those days, who themselfs were lying at the<br />    feet of<br />          british.<br />          His pride would have killed him to sing to those guys.</p>
<p>          What is the accolade Bharathi got these days? We discussing<br />  his<br />    poems on<br />          birth anniversary or being mentioned in the school text books?</p>

<p>            I agree with Mr.Venketesh. Bharathi is certainly getting<br />  a<br />    lot of<br />            accolades these days than when he was alive. As<br />  Mr.Venketesh<br />    said he<br />            dint even feed his family, a duty which is of primary<br />    importance.</p>

<p>              the man from an ordinary family. died a pauper. left<br />  behind<br />    a<br />              destitute family whom he couldnt even feed properly<br />  during<br />    his<br />              lifetimes.</p>
<p>              held no post or wielded any power and 125 years have<br />  passed<br />    since he</p>
<p>              was born.<br />              still we hear his patriotic poem and blood races thro the<br />    veins like</p>
<p>              volcanic lava.<br />              we hear his romantic poem and remember the times we loved<br />    and lost</p>
<p>              we hear his poem on social upliftment and are happy our<br />    country has<br />              achieved that.</p>
<p>              125 years is a long time and a man from the past being a<br />    part of our</p>

<p>and incidentally when it is in place it spurs on development and <br />revenues.<br />lazy politicians cannot spur on development because they dont <br />envision new projects.this theory goes wrong only in the case of arms <br />of war.</p>
<p>one small maths. sps can correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>on the old mahabalipuram road which has seen the greatest price rise <br />amongst any property in india in a span of 3 years.</p>
<p>an acre used to cost 5 lakhs say 5 years back.<br />when that land changes hands the government makes 14% by way of <br />registrations.<br />so it amounted to 70,000 rupees.</p>
<p>then the government made a plan for a 6 lane express way on this <br />road. and the land prices hit the roof.</p>
<p>the same land costs a crore per acre now. and changes hands faster. <br />the government makes 14 lakhs now. the politicians make a good cut on <br />the road and everyone is happy.<br />venketesh</p>

They are of the opinion that the reason India tends to <br />lag<br />  behind in some areas is because we have not 'suffered' enough. In <br />these<br />  discussions somehow this 1942 famine gets conveniently left out. To <br />fair to<br />  us i think we have been through more suffering than most countries <br />and are<br />  still at logger-heads with our neighbhours.<br />  Just the fact that we have become one of the fastest growing <br />economies after<br />  loosing more than 5million to famine and a lot more to 2 major wars <br />with our<br />  neighbhours, all in a spcae of 50 years, definitely makes us great.</p>

<p>    On the 16th October 1942 the whole east coast of Bengal and <br />Orissa<br />    was hit by a cyclone. A huge area of rice cultivation up to forty<br />    miles inland was flooded, causing the autumn crop in these areas <br />to<br />    fail. This meant that the peasantry had to eat their surplus, and <br />the<br />    seed that should have been planted in the winter of 1942-3 had <br />been<br />    consumed by the time the hot weather began in May 1943.</p>
<p>    This was worsened by exports of food and appropriation of arable<br />    land. However, nobel laureate Amartya Sen has shown conclusively <br />that<br />    there was no overall shortage of rice in Bengal in 1943: <br />availability<br />    was actually slightly higher than in 1941, when there was no <br />famine</p>
<p>    It was partly this which conditioned the sluggish official <br />response<br />    to the disaster, as there had been no serious crop failures and <br />hence<br />    the famine was unexpected. Its root causes, Sen argues, lay in<br />    rumours of shortage which caused hoarding, and rapid price <br />inflation<br />    caused by war-time demands which made rice stocks an excellent<br />    investment.</p>
<p>    so more than shortage it was the capacity to afford rice at double<br />    the price that caused it.</p>

<p>        famine was common in india. though just after bharathi's <br />death in<br />        1942, 5 million people died in bengal of hunger and related <br />causes</p>
<p>        more than the population of many countries.</p>
<p>        bharathi had truly outline the priorities.</p>

<p>              Hi;               &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We <br />are<br />          discussing his<br />              poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's <br />are<br />    one<br />          of our<br />              greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect <br />(among<br />        quite<br />          a few<br />              people), there are statues, places named after the great<br />    poet.<br />          School books<br />              have ensured his immortality making sure almost every <br />kid<br />        learns<br />          his poems<br />              during the all important childhood even though they are <br />not<br />    too<br />          inclined to<br />              teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i <br />have<br />        left<br />          out a few<br />              more things.</></p>
<p>              Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought <br />to<br />    do<br />        for<br />          a poet?<br />              There are instances where somebody has unintentionally <br />been<br />          disrespectful of<br />              this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our<br />    hands<br />        to<br />          ensure that<br />              these poems dont fade away with this generation but<br />    continue to<br />          inspire more<br />              generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>              Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he <br />was a<br />    bad<br />          father and<br />              dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would <br />have<br />          admired his<br />              poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be<br />    earning? I<br />          know his<br />              priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but <br />then why<br />        did<br />          he marry?!<br />              Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had<br />    commited<br />          suicide and<br />              Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been<br />    discussin<br />          him!! I<br />              think it is his wife who has not been getting the <br />accolades<br />    she<br />          deserves!!!</p>

<p>                      when the new age secularists were sucking their<br />    thumbs,<br />          this man<br />                    has<br />                      already laid down the doctrine, but as usual he<br />    didnt<br />        get<br />          the<br />                    place<br />                      he deserves for this.</p>

        <p>Thats a nice conspiracy theory! But I think you are right! Every state is<br />competing with each other in attracting foriegn companies to invest in thier<br />state. It could be because of the foreign companies are ready to pay huge<br />bribes and start work. TN seems to be getting a lot FDI these days!!!<br />Anyways the bribes are being paid by companies who can afford it and not by<br />the common man. I say let those guys pay the bribes to setup companies here!<br />;)</p>

<p>  on the old mahabalipuram road which has seen the greatest price rise<br />  amongst any property in india in a span of 3 years.</p>
<p>  an acre used to cost 5 lakhs say 5 years back.<br />  when that land changes hands the government makes 14% by way of<br />  registrations.<br />  so it amounted to 70,000 rupees.</p>
<p>  then the government made a plan for a 6 lane express way on this<br />  road. and the land prices hit the roof.</p>
<p>  the same land costs a crore per acre now. and changes hands faster.<br />  the government makes 14 lakhs now. the politicians make a good cut on<br />  the road and everyone is happy.<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>    Hi;     There is a popular belief in the so-called developed countries that<br />  to be<br />    great a country/company/individual has to go through a really<br />  harrowing<br />    experience. They are of the opinion that the reason India tends to<br />  lag<br />    behind in some areas is because we have not 'suffered' enough. In<br />  these<br />    discussions somehow this 1942 famine gets conveniently left out. To<br />  fair to<br />    us i think we have been through more suffering than most countries<br />  and are<br />    still at logger-heads with our neighbhours.<br />    Just the fact that we have become one of the fastest growing<br />  economies after<br />    loosing more than 5million to famine and a lot more to 2 major wars<br />  with our<br />    neighbhours, all in a spcae of 50 years, definitely makes us great.</p>

<p>      On the 16th October 1942 the whole east coast of Bengal and<br />  Orissa<br />      was hit by a cyclone. A huge area of rice cultivation up to forty<br />      miles inland was flooded, causing the autumn crop in these areas<br />  to<br />      fail. This meant that the peasantry had to eat their surplus, and<br />  the<br />      seed that should have been planted in the winter of 1942-3 had<br />  been<br />      consumed by the time the hot weather began in May 1943.</p>
<p>      This was worsened by exports of food and appropriation of arable<br />      land. However, nobel laureate Amartya Sen has shown conclusively<br />  that<br />      there was no overall shortage of rice in Bengal in 1943:<br />  availability<br />      was actually slightly higher than in 1941, when there was no<br />  famine</p>
<p>      It was partly this which conditioned the sluggish official<br />  response<br />      to the disaster, as there had been no serious crop failures and<br />  hence<br />      the famine was unexpected. Its root causes, Sen argues, lay in<br />      rumours of shortage which caused hoarding, and rapid price<br />  inflation<br />      caused by war-time demands which made rice stocks an excellent<br />      investment.</p>
<p>      so more than shortage it was the capacity to afford rice at double<br />      the price that caused it.</p>

<p>          famine was common in india. though just after bharathi's<br />  death in<br />          1942, 5 million people died in bengal of hunger and related<br />  causes</p>

<p>          bharathi had truly outline the priorities.</p>

<p>                Hi;                 &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We<br />  are<br />            discussing his<br />                poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's<br />  are<br />      one<br />            of our<br />                greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect<br />  (among<br />          quite<br />            a few<br />                people), there are statues, places named after the great<br />      poet.<br />            School books<br />                have ensured his immortality making sure almost every<br />  kid<br />          learns<br />            his poems<br />                during the all important childhood even though they are<br />  not<br />      too<br />            inclined to<br />                teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i<br />  have<br />          left<br />            out a few<br />                more things.</></p>
<p>                Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought<br />  to<br />      do<br />          for<br />            a poet?<br />                There are instances where somebody has unintentionally<br />  been<br />            disrespectful of<br />                this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our<br />      hands<br />          to<br />            ensure that<br />                these poems dont fade away with this generation but<br />      continue to<br />            inspire more<br />                generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>                Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he<br />  was a<br />      bad<br />            father and<br />                dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would<br />  have<br />            admired his<br />                poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be<br />      earning? I<br />            know his<br />                priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but<br />  then why<br />          did<br />            he marry?!<br />                Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had<br />      commited<br />            suicide and<br />                Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been<br />      discussin<br />            him!! I<br />                think it is his wife who has not been getting the<br />  accolades<br />      she<br />            deserves!!!</p>

<p>                      volcanic lava.<br />                      we hear his romantic poem and remember the times<br />  we<br />      loved<br />            and lost</p>
<p>                      we hear his poem on social upliftment and are<br />  happy<br />      our<br />            country has<br />                      achieved that.</p>

          1942 Bengal Famine        </div>

        <p>hi Rahul<br />I have this favourite theory o mine. you could call me crazy for that<br />but somehow I fee corruption is the driving force in our progress</p>
<p>only if we put a road a politician can make money.<br />only if we build a dam a politician gets his commision.</p>
<p>and incidentally when it is in place it spurs on development and <br />revenues.<br />lazy politicians cannot spur on development because they dont <br />envision new projects.this theory goes wrong only in the case of arms <br />of war.</p>
<p>one small maths. sps can correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>on the old mahabalipuram road which has seen the greatest price rise <br />amongst any property in india in a span of 3 years.</p>
<p>an acre used to cost 5 lakhs say 5 years back.<br />when that land changes hands the government makes 14% by way of <br />registrations.<br />so it amounted to 70,000 rupees.</p>
<p>then the government made a plan for a 6 lane express way on this <br />road. and the land prices hit the roof.</p>
<p>the same land costs a crore per acre now. and changes hands faster. <br />the government makes 14 lakhs now. the politicians make a good cut on <br />the road and everyone is happy.<br />venketesh</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi;   There is a popular belief in the so-called developed countries that <br />to be<br />  great a country/company/individual has to go through a really <br />harrowing<br />  experience. They are of the opinion that the reason India tends to <br />lag<br />  behind in some areas is because we have not 'suffered' enough. In <br />these<br />  discussions somehow this 1942 famine gets conveniently left out. To <br />fair to<br />  us i think we have been through more suffering than most countries <br />and are<br />  still at logger-heads with our neighbhours.<br />  Just the fact that we have become one of the fastest growing <br />economies after<br />  loosing more than 5million to famine and a lot more to 2 major wars <br />with our<br />  neighbhours, all in a spcae of 50 years, definitely makes us great.</p>

<p>    On the 16th October 1942 the whole east coast of Bengal and <br />Orissa<br />    was hit by a cyclone. A huge area of rice cultivation up to forty<br />    miles inland was flooded, causing the autumn crop in these areas <br />to<br />    fail. This meant that the peasantry had to eat their surplus, and <br />the<br />    seed that should have been planted in the winter of 1942-3 had <br />been<br />    consumed by the time the hot weather began in May 1943.</p>
<p>    This was worsened by exports of food and appropriation of arable<br />    land. However, nobel laureate Amartya Sen has shown conclusively <br />that<br />    there was no overall shortage of rice in Bengal in 1943: <br />availability<br />    was actually slightly higher than in 1941, when there was no <br />famine</p>
<p>    It was partly this which conditioned the sluggish official <br />response<br />    to the disaster, as there had been no serious crop failures and <br />hence<br />    the famine was unexpected. Its root causes, Sen argues, lay in<br />    rumours of shortage which caused hoarding, and rapid price <br />inflation<br />    caused by war-time demands which made rice stocks an excellent<br />    investment.</p>
<p>    so more than shortage it was the capacity to afford rice at double<br />    the price that caused it.</p>

<p>        famine was common in india. though just after bharathi's <br />death in<br />        1942, 5 million people died in bengal of hunger and related <br />causes</p>
<p>        more than the population of many countries.</p>
<p>        bharathi had truly outline the priorities.</p>
<p>        in women's lib and hunger we have exceeded whatever he <br />thought and<br />        sought for us</p>

<p>              Hi;               &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We <br />are<br />          discussing his<br />              poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's <br />are<br />    one<br />          of our<br />              greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect <br />(among<br />        quite<br />          a few<br />              people), there are statues, places named after the great<br />    poet.<br />          School books<br />              have ensured his immortality making sure almost every <br />kid<br />        learns<br />          his poems<br />              during the all important childhood even though they are <br />not<br />    too<br />          inclined to<br />              teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i <br />have<br />        left<br />          out a few<br />              more things.</></p>
<p>              Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought <br />to<br />    do<br />        for<br />          a poet?<br />              There are instances where somebody has unintentionally <br />been<br />          disrespectful of<br />              this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our<br />    hands<br />        to<br />          ensure that<br />              these poems dont fade away with this generation but<br />    continue to<br />          inspire more<br />              generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>              Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he <br />was a<br />    bad<br />          father and<br />              dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would <br />have<br />          admired his<br />              poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be<br />    earning? I<br />          know his<br />              priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but <br />then why<br />        did<br />          he marry?!<br />              Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had<br />    commited<br />          suicide and<br />              Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been<br />    discussin<br />          him!!

          1942 Bengal Famine        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi; There is a popular belief in the so-called developed countries that to be<br />great a country/company/individual has to go through a really harrowing<br />experience. They are of the opinion that the reason India tends to lag<br />behind in some areas is because we have not 'suffered' enough. In these<br />discussions somehow this 1942 famine gets conveniently left out. To fair to<br />us i think we have been through more suffering than most countries and are<br />still at logger-heads with our neighbhours.<br />Just the fact that we have become one of the fastest growing economies after<br />loosing more than 5million to famine and a lot more to 2 major wars with our<br />neighbhours, all in a spcae of 50 years, definitely makes us great.</p>

<blockquote><p>  On the 16th October 1942 the whole east coast of Bengal and Orissa<br />  was hit by a cyclone. A huge area of rice cultivation up to forty<br />  miles inland was flooded, causing the autumn crop in these areas to<br />  fail. This meant that the peasantry had to eat their surplus, and the<br />  seed that should have been planted in the winter of 1942-3 had been<br />  consumed by the time the hot weather began in May 1943.</p>
<p>  This was worsened by exports of food and appropriation of arable<br />  land. However, nobel laureate Amartya Sen has shown conclusively that<br />  there was no overall shortage of rice in Bengal in 1943: availability<br />  was actually slightly higher than in 1941, when there was no famine</p>
<p>  It was partly this which conditioned the sluggish official response<br />  to the disaster, as there had been no serious crop failures and hence<br />  the famine was unexpected. Its root causes, Sen argues, lay in<br />  rumours of shortage which caused hoarding, and rapid price inflation<br />  caused by war-time demands which made rice stocks an excellent<br />  investment.</p>
<p>  so more than shortage it was the capacity to afford rice at double<br />  the price that caused it.</p>

<p>    Hi;     Its good that the "Bengal Famine" has been mentioned even though in<br />  a<br />    different context. This has been a point which has always been left<br />  out when<br />    the British rule is being defended. Hope somebody can give a good<br />    description on this terrible event as a new thread.</p>

<p>      famine was common in india. though just after bharathi's death in<br />      1942, 5 million people died in bengal of hunger and related causes</p>
<p>      more than the population of many countries.</p>
<p>      bharathi had truly outline the priorities.</p>

<p>        bharathi lived during a time of famines and mass starvation<br />  deaths.</p>
<p>        he must have been proud of india today inspite of all our ills<br />  and<br />        ailments, corruption and what not.</p>

<p>            Hi;             &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We are<br />        discussing his<br />            poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's are<br />  one<br />        of our<br />            greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect (among<br />      quite<br />        a few<br />            people), there are statues, places named after the great<br />  poet.<br />        School books<br />            have ensured his immortality making sure almost every kid<br />      learns<br />        his poems<br />            during the all important childhood even though they are not<br />  too<br />        inclined to<br />            teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i have<br />      left<br />        out a few<br />            more things.</></p>
<p>            Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought to<br />  do<br />      for<br />        a poet?<br />            There are instances where somebody has unintentionally been<br />        disrespectful of<br />            this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our<br />  hands<br />      to<br />        ensure that<br />            these poems dont fade away with this generation but<br />  continue to<br />        inspire more<br />            generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>            Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he was a<br />  bad<br />        father and<br />            dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would have<br />        admired his<br />            poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be<br />  earning? I<br />        know his<br />            priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but then why<br />      did<br />        he marry?!<br />            Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had<br />  commited<br />        suicide and<br />            Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been<br />  discussin<br />        him!! I<br />            think it is his wife who has not been getting the accolades<br />  she<br />        deserves!!!</p>

          1942 Bengal Famine        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Amartya Sen was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1998 for his <br />studies of the Bengal famine and other famines in Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>Citing the Bengal Famine and other examples from the world, Amartya <br />Sen argues that famines do not occur in functioning democracies. </p>
<p>During the British rule in India there were approximately 25 major <br />famines spread through states such as Tamil Nadu in South India, <br />Bihar in the north, and Bengal in the east in the latter half of the <br />19th century, killing between 30 and 40 million Indians </p>
<p>Though malnutrition and hunger remain widespread in India, there <br />have been no famines since the end of the British rule in 1947 and <br />the establishment of a democratic government. There has however been <br />a recurrent threat of famine in Bangladesh</p>
<p>Possibly over a million people died in the Bangladesh famine of 1974, <br />and one disturbing fact.At the height of the 1974 famine in the newly <br />born Bangladesh, the US had withheld 2.2 million tonnes of food aid <br />to 'ensure that it abandoned plans to try Pakistani war criminals'</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi;   Its good that the "Bengal Famine" has been mentioned even though in <br />a<br />  different context. This has been a point which has always been left <br />out when<br />  the British rule is being defended. Hope somebody can give a good<br />  description on this terrible event as a new thread.</p>

<p>    famine was common in india. though just after bharathi's death in<br />    1942, 5 million people died in bengal of hunger and related causes</p>
<p>    more than the population of many countries.</p>
<p>    bharathi had truly outline the priorities.</p>
<p>    in women's lib and hunger we have exceeded whatever he thought and<br />    sought for us</p>

<p>      I am using your quote for another observation.</p>
<p>      bharathi lived during a time of famines and mass starvation <br />deaths.</p>
<p>      he must have been proud of india today inspite of all our ills <br />and<br />      ailments, corruption and what not.</p>
<p>      we have done extremely well in the path bharathi envisioned for <br />us.</p>

<p>          Hi;           &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We are<br />      discussing his<br />          poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's are <br />one<br />      of our<br />          greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect (among<br />    quite<br />      a few<br />          people), there are statues, places named after the great <br />poet.<br />      School books<br />          have ensured his immortality making sure almost every kid<br />    learns<br />      his poems<br />          during the all important childhood even though they are not <br />too<br />      inclined to<br />          teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i have<br />    left<br />      out a few<br />          more things.</></p>
<p>          Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought to <br />do<br />    for<br />      a poet?<br />          There are instances where somebody has unintentionally been<br />      disrespectful of<br />          this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our <br />hands<br />    to<br />      ensure that<br />          these poems dont fade away with this generation but <br />continue to<br />      inspire more<br />          generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>          Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he was a <br />bad<br />      father and<br />          dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would have<br />      admired his<br />          poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be <br />earning? I<br />      know his<br />          priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but then why<br />    did<br />      he marry?!<br />          Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had <br />commited<br />      suicide and<br />          Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been <br />discussin<br />      him!! I<br />          think it is his wife who has not been getting the accolades <br />she<br />      deserves!!!</p>

          1942 Bengal Famine        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>On the 16th October 1942 the whole east coast of Bengal and Orissa <br />was hit by a cyclone. A huge area of rice cultivation up to forty <br />miles inland was flooded, causing the autumn crop in these areas to <br />fail. This meant that the peasantry had to eat their surplus, and the <br />seed that should have been planted in the winter of 1942-3 had been <br />consumed by the time the hot weather began in May 1943. </p>
<p>This was worsened by exports of food and appropriation of arable <br />land. However, nobel laureate Amartya Sen has shown conclusively that <br />there was no overall shortage of rice in Bengal in 1943: availability <br />was actually slightly higher than in 1941, when there was no famine </p>
<p>It was partly this which conditioned the sluggish official response <br />to the disaster, as there had been no serious crop failures and hence <br />the famine was unexpected. Its root causes, Sen argues, lay in <br />rumours of shortage which caused hoarding, and rapid price inflation <br />caused by war-time demands which made rice stocks an excellent <br />investment.</p>
<p>so more than shortage it was the capacity to afford rice at double <br />the price that caused it.</p>

<p>    famine was common in india. though just after bharathi's death in<br />    1942, 5 million people died in bengal of hunger and related causes</p>
<p>    more than the population of many countries.</p>
<p>    bharathi had truly outline the priorities.</p>

<p>      I am using your quote for another observation.</p>
<p>      bharathi lived during a time of famines and mass starvation <br />deaths.</p>
<p>      he must have been proud of india today inspite of all our ills <br />and<br />      ailments, corruption and what not.</p>
<p>      we have done extremely well in the path bharathi envisioned for <br />us.</p>

<p>          Hi;           &lt;< What is the accolade Bharathi got these days?   We are<br />      discussing his<br />          poems as are many others in India and abroad (the NRI's are <br />one<br />      of our<br />          greatest assets). The name Bharathi invokes respect (among<br />    quite<br />      a few<br />          people), there are statues, places named after the great <br />poet.<br />      School books<br />          have ensured his immortality making sure almost every kid<br />    learns<br />      his poems<br />          during the all important childhood even though they are not <br />too<br />      inclined to<br />          teach the meanings of those beautiful lines. Im sure i have<br />    left<br />      out a few<br />          more things.</></p>
<p>          Aren't these accolades? What else do you think we ought to <br />do<br />    for<br />      a poet?<br />          There are instances where somebody has unintentionally been<br />      disrespectful of<br />          this great poet but so are they of Gandhi. It is in our <br />hands<br />    to<br />      ensure that<br />          these poems dont fade away with this generation but <br />continue to<br />      inspire more<br />          generations of patriots and lovers.</p>
<p>          Remember for all of Bharathi's greatness as a poet he was a <br />bad<br />      father and<br />          dreadfully bad husband. Do you think his family would have<br />      admired his<br />          poetry when the man of the house was supposed to be <br />earning? I<br />      know his<br />          priorities lay with the Indian freedom movement but then why<br />    did<br />      he marry?!<br />          Try to think in a filmi way...if his wife and kids had <br />commited<br />      suicide and<br />          Bharathi had been hung for that we wouldn't have been <br />discussin<br />      him!! I<br />          think it is his wife who has not been getting the accolades <br />she<br />      deserves!!!</p>
