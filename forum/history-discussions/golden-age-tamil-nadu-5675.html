Like north India, the tamil classical works like collections of Nambi-andar-Nambi,&nbsp;Periyapuranam, Kalingattu Parani and Kambaramayanam were born in those periods.

Economically most of 200 years the chola country was in strongest terms&nbsp;of wealth management..</P <br /></p><P &nbsp;</P <br /></p><P I have taken only positive happenings for defining the Golden Age.

        <p>Dear SPS</p>
<p>I would be curious to know how <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  had held the rule in kingdoms <br />beyond Kalinga. His administration policies, I do not see them as <br />anexures on Kulothunga I or later. Did <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  just plunder those <br />kingdoms for wealth or was he in any way wanting to unite the <br />subcontinent.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Was his purpose of overseas conquest also similar to concept of <br />Alexander or just to get wealth?</p>
<p>If we negate both his subordinate and oversea conquests from his <br />achievement, I would think Vichitra sithan aka M.Varman had a golden <br />rule also and his son had extended the same too... barring the brutal <br />burn down of Vatapi.</p>

<p>  The time frame of Thirumalai Thirudan is post Adhi Rajendra, s/o <br />  Rajendra I. (1070 AD).</p>
<p>  Pls check our Archieves for postings related to Rajendra's Sons .. <br />  They ruled for about 30 years and brought an end to Rajaraja's <br />  hierarchy - through his only son Rajendra's siblings... and the <br />  Empire given by Rajendra I to his sons was NOT held in tact and <br />they <br />  could not match it ever afterwards.</p>
<p>  Kulothunga I stepped in (1071 AD) through Rajaraja's daughter <br />  Kundavi whose husband Vimaladithan hails from Chalukyas - installed <br />  at Vengi (Vizag region).</p>
<p>  Therefore the Spell created by RRC I ended in 1040 with Rajendra I.</p>
<p>  Kulothunga I and Kulothunga II are undoubtedly very Good Rulers..</p>
<p>  Re comparing theirs with the Spell of RRC and Rajendra I ... </p>
<p>  Unfortunately the controversial subjects like Thillai <br />  Govindarajaperumal whether put in sea, whether St Ramanujar was <br />  moved out of Chozha Empire - are related to this period only .. <br />  through very megre mention in some Vaishnavites Bakthi literary <br />  works.</p>
<p>  We have discussed these things also in detail.. ( a sample posted <br />  below) </p>
<p>  With Democratic line of thinking in an Emperor (RRC),<br />  with Secularism embedded in a staunch Saivite Sivapathasekaran <br />(RRC) <br />  &amp; sivasarana sekaran (RjC),<br />  with almost South of Vindhya and Lanka under the rule of RRC and <br />  good number of Far -East annexed under the rule of RjC,<br />  with acknowledged Friends like Bhojan in the North (who warred with <br />  Gazni), I would maintain that the 70 year peak of RRC + RjC is <br />  unparallelled in the 400 years spell of Medevial Chozhas.</p>
<p>  Chithirai Vazhthukkal.</p>

<p>  Tamilnadu Temple Art - R.Nagaswqamy 13283 <br />  dated 25.08.2006</p>
<p>  Dear Friends, recently in Thanjai Rajarajan manimandapam (basement<br />  building where Tiruvalanchuzhi Kshetrabalara &amp; RRCs "mummudichozha<br />  mandalam" inscriptions are stored - along with other Art assets by <br />  the State, I purchased the subject book (Thamizhaga Koirkalaigal) <br />  authored by Dr. Nagaswamy and Ma. Chandramurthy Published in 1973 -</p>
<p>  Third Edition (Not revised) - 2004. Contains only 105 pages <br />devoted <br />  to Sangam Arts, Tamilnadu Temples, Koil ilakkanam, varalaru, <br />  gopurangal, sirpangal, bronze and paintings (all in Tamilnadu <br />  temples). </p>
<p>  Sangam Arts deals with Vaasthu &amp; Building designs (Noolari <br />Pulavar -<br />  Nedunalvadai) - Koil (wood - clay Kottams) - Aranmanai - Entrance <br />in<br />  which elephants with flags could pass through !) - Paintings <br />  ===========================================================<br />  (Chithira maadam) - Thugiligai - Oviam - Chithiram - PADAM - <br />  PADAAM -<br />  =========================================================</p>
<p>    One is Pa- da - m : Picture : of human / natural scenes etc.,<br />  Another is Pa - daam : Picture of God / Goddess.</p>
<p>  In early ages, Sudhai idols were worshipped. Pictures of Gods / <br />  Goddess were painted over the clothes and they were worshipped in <br />  the temples. Eloborate process is also discussed in the subject <br />  book. When the Padaam becomes worn out, it is necessary to replace <br />  the same and the worn-out Padaam is known as NIRMALYAM.</p>
<p>  Present Govindaraja in Thillai is established only in the 15th <br />  Century. </p>
<p>  During Chozhas period padaam of Govindaraja is only to have been <br />  under worship. Nirmalyam - to avoid contact with human foot - used <br />  to be put in the sea - after Balalayam - the Power of God / <br />goddess <br />  transferred temporarily to another object of worhsip till the <br />  ultimate object of worship is put position and life inducted.</p>
<p>  It was only Nirmalyam padaam was put in the sea..</p>
<p>  Chozhas - for that matter all the Tamil Kings - are all more <br />  secular - permitting worship of various Faiths including Buddha / <br />  Jain and gave grants / constructed Viharas. </p>
<p>  Kalki clearly refers this Sundara Chozha Vinnagaram, Kundavai <br />  Jinalayam in Ponniyinselvan.. which I evidenced in my <br />  mail "Ennayiram".</p>

        <p>good number of Far -East annexed under the rule of <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym ,.....</p>
<p>Hi sps sir, not sure we can say annexed. Rajendra efforts were at best clinical assaults aimed at destroying the maritime (ports) power of the srivijayan empire. South east asia maybe...srilanka def yes, maldives ...not sure if it became a domain. Of the far eastern stats - srivijaya based out of modern day palembang to malaya were raised to dust. ( The famous bringing bk of the vijaya thorana)...kambosa desa was showering a lot of gifts ... The chariot inscription plus the kambosa stone. Maybe u could in that sense call them a fiduciary..... So I am not sure if annexation is the right term to put in general. </p>
<p>Infact that is what I feel is the main diff between <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  n <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym . <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  for eg, worked at expanding chola empire ( <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  fought for him though) but he added real terriories, <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym 's ganges campaign has various versions...incl an incursion.</p>

<p>With Democratic line of thinking in an Emperor (RRC),<br />with Secularism embedded in a staunch Saivite Sivapathasekaran (RRC) <br />&amp; sivasarana sekaran (RjC),<br />with almost South of Vindhya and Lanka under the rule of RRC and <br />good number of Far -East annexed under the rule of RjC,<br />with acknowledged Friends like Bhojan in the North (who warred with <br />Gazni), I would maintain that the 70 year peak of RRC + RjC is <br />unparallelled in the 400 years spell of Medevial Chozhas.</p>

<p>Tamilnadu Temple Art - R.Nagaswqamy 13283 <br />dated 25.08.2006</p>
<p>Dear Friends, recently in Thanjai Rajarajan manimandapam (basement<br />building where Tiruvalanchuzhi Kshetrabalara &amp; RRCs "mummudichozha<br />mandalam" inscriptions are stored - along with other Art assets by <br />the State, I purchased the subject book (Thamizhaga Koirkalaigal) <br />authored by Dr. Nagaswamy and Ma. Chandramurthy Published in 1973 - <br />Third Edition (Not revised) - 2004. Contains only 105 pages devoted <br />to Sangam Arts, Tamilnadu Temples, Koil ilakkanam, varalaru, <br />gopurangal, sirpangal, bronze and paintings (all in Tamilnadu <br />temples). </p>
<p>Sangam Arts deals with Vaasthu &amp; Building designs (Noolari Pulavar -<br />Nedunalvadai) - Koil (wood - clay Kottams) - Aranmanai - Entrance in<br />which elephants with flags could pass through !) - Paintings <br />===========================================================<br />(Chithira maadam) - Thugiligai - Oviam - Chithiram - PADAM - <br />PADAAM -<br />=========================================================</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  One is Pa- da - m : Picture : of human / natural scenes etc.,<br />Another is Pa - daam : Picture of God / Goddess.</p></blockquote>
<p>In early ages, Sudhai idols were worshipped. Pictures of Gods / <br />Goddess were painted over the clothes and they were worshipped in <br />the temples. Eloborate process is also discussed in the subject <br />book. When the Padaam becomes worn out, it is necessary to replace <br />the same and the worn-out Padaam is known as NIRMALYAM.</p>
<p>Present Govindaraja in Thillai is established only in the 15th <br />Century. </p>
<p>During Chozhas period padaam of Govindaraja is only to have been <br />under worship. Nirmalyam - to avoid contact with human foot - used <br />to be put in the sea - after Balalayam - the Power of God / goddess <br />transferred temporarily to another object of worhsip till the <br />ultimate object of worship is put position and life inducted.</p>
<p>It was only Nirmalyam padaam was put in the sea..</p>
<p>Chozhas - for that matter all the Tamil Kings - are all more <br />secular - permitting worship of various Faiths including Buddha / <br />Jain and gave grants / constructed Viharas. </p>
<p>Kalki clearly refers this Sundara Chozha Vinnagaram, Kundavai <br />Jinalayam in Ponniyinselvan.. which I evidenced in my <br />mail "Ennayiram".</p>

          Golden Age of Tamil Nadu        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear VK</p>
<p>The chola era was truly a golden era in Indian History though the Indian historians may not want to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>They jump from Golden age of Guptas to Mugals and British.</p>
<p>But there is a 300 year span where a Large Empire existed…spanning half of Indian peninsula, into Maldives and Sri lanka with successful overseas campaigns into Malay peninsula and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Art flourished Chola bronzes are still valuable</p>
<p>Architecture hit the skies</p>
<p>Irrigation and local administration was at its peak</p>
<p>More importantly it was all recorded</p>
<p>I am not sure how many of you viewed the Story of India which Thiru sent…</p>
<p>But the narrator explains why he thinks Chola times were at par with Goldenage of Guptas….</p>
<p>Interesting comment ..you may think the British brought beuracracy and irrigation to India but that was not the case.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Sri</p>

<p>Dear SPS, </p>
<p>In a recent post, you have said that the ruling period of Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra (985 CE to 1044) was said to be a golden period. </p>
<p>In general to define a golden period, what are the credential needed? The Gupta's period during Chandragupta-1 - Samudhra Gupta - &amp; Vikramathiya, was already mentioned in history books of India as 'Golden Age of India'. So many sanscritic classics works were born during that period including Kalidasa.</p>
<p>Rajaraja's rule was remarkably well during that period except some warring times. The wars also were won, and the people said to be living in happy, so that the King was having enough time in spending his concentration on Big Temple and other connected works, apart from the other administrative handlings. The period was generally calm. The King brought out a democratic ruling culture in village level. The able administration was another crediteria so that to keep federal cheif's under the King's control. Most importantly nature also have co-operated so that not many calamities.</p>
<p>But this situation was extended till Kulottungan-2 and even his son that was upto 1185 CE.</p>
<p>So can we say the years of 985 to 1185 CE or upto 1200 CE was the Golden Age of </p>
<p>Tamilnadu? Like north India, the tamil classical works like collections of Nambi-andar-Nambi, Periyapuranam, Kalingattu Parani and Kambaramayanam wereborn in those periods. Scores of Temples were built and art works displayed all over the state. Except some small times during Vikraman ruling there were not much natural calamities. Almost wars ended with Northern neighbores.</p>
<p>These 200 years, the whole Tamilnadu and Kerala as well of eastern part ofpresent Karnataka and Southern Andhra (almost like British Madras State during Pre-independent India,) was under the complete control of Cholas. Mostimportantly except some warring times, the peace prevailed almost in all the part of this particular chola country. </p>
<p>Great Philosophers like Ramanuja, Meykantar were born in this period. And intellectual think-tank was highly seen as satisfactory in this period. Naval strength was commandable. Sea pirates were not seen in the eastern sea, so the merchandism was well handled at ports. Economically most of 200 yearsthe chola country was in strongest terms of wealth management..</p>
<p>I have taken only positive happenings for defining the Golden Age. You can add more inputs. </p>
<p>Dhivakar.</p>
