</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I visited the Chichen Itza in Mexico earlier this week, the temples<br />and its construction was absolutely brilliant, felt for sometime that<br />I was standing in sarabeswarar temple at Tanjore instead of Chichen.</p>
<p>The construction and the rise of their rule (mayan) was in 600 AD to<br />1200 AD, which is pretty much the same time of our rise of II gen Chozas.</p>
<p>Though not highly developed in literature and art, their carvings and<br />construction is simply superb. Instead of a king, they were ruled by a<br />high priest called Kukulcan and here is the deal...he was seated on a<br />throne of Jaguar (their prime symbol is the Jaguar).</p>
<p>Their acoustics in temples was brilliant. </p>
<p>Their religious grouping was based on simple principles, our guide was<br />a mexican christian who felt it was ridiculous that the Mayan thought<br />Rain was God and Sun was God etc... </p>
<p>The evident truth was, not much literature of Mayan, a religion<br />without a spiritual base and not much technical superiority compared<br />to Chola dynasty, however, their construction was similar to our<br />architecture. No one knows the answer to how the construction was<br />done, but they do have explanation on WHY the construction was done.<br />Mayan - the name is however very indian and itza was the community of<br />Mayans who built the temple, it means Magician in ancient mayan<br />language. End of day, all very mysterious and I was wondering with the<br />naval strengths of our guys, mexico is not far away from South asia<br />via Japan.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was an interesting visit and I thought some of our friends<br />here may have some insight to a comparison to the civilization.</p>
<p>incase anyone wants to read more on them wiki has a good write up.<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza</a></p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi,<br />  Talking of religions fighting it out, reminds me of how two big empires<br />  keeping fighting each other and spend all their energies and allow an<br />  entirely king or empire to show up.<br />  Eg:<br />  1. 850AD Pallavas and Pandiyas fight it out - thirupurambiyam, out of it<br />  comes the new empire building by cholas.<br />  2. 15-16th Vijayanagar and Bahmini kingdoms fight it out, result is that<br />  goa comes under permanent portugese territory.<br />  3. Aurangazeb goes into fighting the flourishing maratha kingdom, results<br />  in Punjab sikh kingdom.<br />  4. Aurangazeb goes fighting against the deccan sultanate, results in<br />  Shivaji's maratha empire building.<br />  5. 1st BC/2nd AD Chola and Pandiyas keep fighting, results in Kalapirarars<br />  taking over tamilnadu.<br />  6. Chola and Pandiya fight it out during Kulothunga 2's reign, resulting<br />  in Hoysala someshvara extending his kingdom all the way into samayapuram.</p>
<p>  oops, the list is growing, someone else can add to this list.</p>
<p>  So, if two big enemies fight it out, result is that next level players are<br />  going to get their chance to move up, in this case it could be buddhism and<br />  hinduism.</p>
<p>  Wish you all a very happy new year 2008, and I am praying that this year<br />  brings in peace, health, prosperity and happiness to all.</p>

<p>    Its really very interesting. Some of the points i would like to note<br />    are:</p>
<p>    1. Prior to islam and christianity, almost all people of this planet<br />    were nature worshippers. Europe was full of tribes, with indigneous<br />    culture, worshipping nature. Today, there are around 20 million<br />    paganist &amp; pantheist in europe, who are in search of their ancient<br />    roots through various literatures (particularly german literature),<br />    and trying to rebuild their culture. One such is the fire worship<br />    that one of the german tribes are following.</p>
<p>    2. I remember reading one of the sankarachariyar, saying, California<br />    was nothing but "Kalaprayan" (i dont know the real name).. ie, in our<br />    ancient purana, one of the boar (or pig) dig the earth and reached out<br />    of the other end. and if see the geographical position, california<br />    was exactly the other end of india.</p>
<p>    3. 2012 was going to be most important year for the whole world. In<br />    Hindu prophetism, it was accorded as the year of destruction and havoc.<br />    Similarly, many of astrologers predicted, america is going to perish,<br />    if headed by a woman.. and now hilary is certain to be elected in<br />    2008, can there be any relation b/w events.<br />    Personally, i believe, nothing happens isolated in this world...<br />    rather every event is a chain to some previous events.<br />    In that angle, considering all these, 2012 is going to be auspicious.</p>
<p>    Also, its told that Hinduism will resurge, showing light to the whole<br />    world.<br />    With emergence of Modi, and resurgence of saffron wave, it seems to<br />    come true.</p>
<p>    My prediction is that there will be heavy fight b/w muslims &amp;     Christians, and western nations will attempt to destroy the muslim<br />    world.<br />    India may not join them, and may rather protect our muslim people from<br />    such world wide backslash. Having the centre of islam destructed, our<br />    muslim people will gradually merge with the mainstream thus closing<br />    the cycle of history and embracing their common ancestry with Hindus.<br />    (today, many of the muslims are well aware of the brahmin roots, and<br />    personally &amp; secretly preserving it.

<p>        There are more to the Mayan's, for ex: Sun God is the God of<br />      Energy,<br />        Moon is for fertility, Eagle for sight - dhoora dristi, Jaguar as a<br />        God of Power etc.<br />        Pretty much similar to Surya, Chandra, Garuda etc.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,<br />Talking of religions fighting it out, reminds me of how two big empires keeping fighting each other and spend all their energies and allow an entirely king or empire to show up. <br />Eg:<br />1. 850AD Pallavas and Pandiyas fight it out - thirupurambiyam, out of it comes the new empire building by cholas.<br />2. 15-16th Vijayanagar and Bahmini kingdoms fight it out, result is that goa comes under permanent portugese territory.<br />3. Aurangazeb goes into fighting the flourishing maratha kingdom, results in Punjab sikh kingdom.<br />4. Aurangazeb goes fighting against the deccan sultanate, results in Shivaji's maratha empire building.<br />5. 1st BC/2nd AD Chola and Pandiyas keep fighting, results in Kalapirarars taking over tamilnadu.<br />6. Chola and Pandiya fight it out during Kulothunga 2's reign, resulting in Hoysala someshvara extending his kingdom all the way into samayapuram.</p>
<p>oops, the list is growing, someone else can add to this list. </p>
<p>So, if two big enemies fight it out, result is that next level players are going to get their chance to move up, in this case it could be buddhism and hinduism.</p>
<p>Wish you all a very happy new year 2008, and I am praying that this year brings in peace, health, prosperity and happiness to all.</p>

<p>Hi Senthil,</p>
<p>It was like reading a synopsis of a thriller. </p>
<p>regards,<br />siva.</p>
<p>On Dec 29, 2007 6:45 AM, viru <senthil_nkkl@yahoo.com   wrote:<br />Its really very interesting. Some of the points i would like to note are:</senthil_nkkl@yahoo.com></p>
<p>1. Prior to islam and christianity, almost all people of this planet<br />were nature worshippers. Europe was full of tribes, with indigneous<br />culture, worshipping nature. Today, there are around 20 million<br />paganist &amp; pantheist in europe, who are in search of their ancient <br />roots through various literatures (particularly german literature),<br />and trying to rebuild their culture. One such is the fire worship<br />that one of the german tribes are following.</p>
<p>2. I remember reading one of the sankarachariyar, saying, California<br />was nothing but "Kalaprayan" (i dont know the real name).. ie, in our<br />ancient purana, one of the boar (or pig) dig the earth and reached out <br />of the other end. and if see the geographical position, california<br />was exactly the other end of india.</p>
<p>3. 2012 was going to be most important year for the whole world. In<br />Hindu prophetism, it was accorded as the year of destruction and havoc.<br />Similarly, many of astrologers predicted, america is going to perish, <br />if headed by a woman.. and now hilary is certain to be elected in<br />2008, can there be any relation b/w events.<br />Personally, i believe, nothing happens isolated in this world...<br />rather every event is a chain to some previous events. <br />In that angle, considering all these, 2012 is going to be auspicious.</p>
<p>Also, its told that Hinduism will resurge, showing light to the whole<br />world.<br />With emergence of Modi, and resurgence of saffron wave, it seems to<br />come true.</p>
<p>My prediction is that there will be heavy fight b/w muslims &amp; Christians, and western nations will attempt to destroy the muslim<br />world. <br />India may not join them, and may rather protect our muslim people from <br />such world wide backslash. Having the centre of islam destructed, our<br />muslim people will gradually merge with the mainstream thus closing<br />the cycle of history and embracing their common ancestry with Hindus.<br />(today, many of the muslims are well aware of the brahmin roots, and<br />personally &amp; secretly preserving it. The same with case of malaysian<br />and indonesian leaders, secretly preserving their pre-islamic traditions) </p>

        <p>Thanks Ravi..</p>
<p>I too have the same opinion, that whatever is stated should not be<br />taken as it is..</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that such boar theory could have been evolved<br />as a symbology to indicate the position of kapilaranya region.. (Its<br />better to say scientifically that its 180 degree opposite to us)..</p>
<p>And such truths and interpretations can be realised only by discussion<br />&amp; positive interaction..</p>
<p>Some one commented my first mail as thrillers.. (it appeared to me<br />the same when i read it two days later).. i would like to clarify,<br />that its my imagination and certain level of predictions.. IT need<br />not be true..</p>

<p>    Thanks for that Vijay. However, I would like to have from Senthil <br />at<br />  least<br />    the following so that I can go through the facts myself.</p>
<p>    1. Sankarachariyar's book where he quotes kalaprayan</p>
<p>    2. 2012 - where in hindu 'prophetism' is 2012 marked as the year <br />of<br />    destruction and death</p>
<p>    3. Who and why is it predicted that a women ruling USA would <br />bring havoc</p>
<p>    4. On what basis are the statements 'muslims and christians will<br />  fight' and<br />    'christians will try to destroy the muslim world' based on?</p>

<p>          Its really very interesting. Some of the points i would like<br />  to note<br />          are:</p>
<p>          1. Prior to islam and christianity, almost all people of <br />this<br />  planet<br />          were nature worshippers. Europe was full of tribes, with<br />  indigneous<br />          culture, worshipping nature. Today, there are around 20 <br />million<br />          paganist &amp; pantheist in europe, who are in search of their <br />ancient<br />          roots through various literatures (particularly german<br />  literature),<br />          and trying to rebuild their culture. One such is the fire <br />worship<br />          that one of the german tribes are following.</p>
<p>          2. I remember reading one of the sankarachariyar, saying,<br />  California<br />          was nothing but "Kalaprayan" (i dont know the real name).. <br />ie,<br />  in our<br />          ancient purana, one of the boar (or pig) dig the earth and<br />  reached out<br />          of the other end. and if see the geographical position, <br />california<br />          was exactly the other end of india.</p>
<p>          3. 2012 was going to be most important year for the whole<br />  world. In<br />          Hindu prophetism, it was accorded as the year of <br />destruction and<br />      havoc.<br />          Similarly, many of astrologers predicted, america is going <br />to<br />  perish,<br />          if headed by a woman.. and now hilary is certain to be <br />elected in<br />          2008, can there be any relation b/w events.<br />          Personally, i believe, nothing happens isolated in this <br />world...<br />          rather every event is a chain to some previous events.<br />          In that angle, considering all these, 2012 is going to be<br />  auspicious.</p>
<p>          Also, its told that Hinduism will resurge, showing light to<br />  the whole<br />          world.<br />          With emergence of Modi, and resurgence of saffron wave, it<br />  seems to<br />          come true.</p>
<p>          My prediction is that there will be heavy fight b/w muslims <br />&amp;           Christians, and western nations will attempt to destroy the </p></senthil_nkkl@></p></madanus@></p></ravi_eds@></p></madanus@></p></blockquote>

        <p>Madan,</p>
<p>I just mailed based on various sources that i came across in the past.<br />I dont claim all these to be valid or true, but since, the mail chain<br />was some what related, i shared my views.</p>
<p>Regarding californiam, the actual sanskrit name quoted was<br />kapilaranya.. I dont know if it is sankaracharya, but found this in<br />one of his website. I am giving the following for reference.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part2/chap2.htm" title="http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part2/chap2.htm">http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part2/chap2.htm</a></p>

<p>They also mention adjacent lands like horse land, ash land, .. <br />although there is no concrete proof, i just mentioned it, because of<br />the some similarity to our ancient texts.</p>
<p>On Hindu Prophecy:<br />Again, this is based on my past reading, which i dont remember<br />exactly. A simple google search gave me these links.</p>

<p>On woman president and prediction of havoc, i have to admit that i<br />dont have any proofs.. Somewhere, i heard, one of our film actor <br />(who is good in astrology) saying that in some local newspaper..</p>
<p>On christians attempting to destroy muslims, again, there is no<br />concrete proof.. However, circumstances prevailing now, shows they are<br />at war even in the present time, although in a different mask..</p>
<p>Its a known secret that the vatican aspires to establish christendom<br />throughout world and the same for muslims.. and both are at war now<br />in iraq &amp; afghanistan.. only time will say, how pakistan event will<br />unfold..</p>
<p>So, when fundamentalists take over power in both america &amp; Britain,<br />there may be chances that they may attempt to do it.  </p>
<p>So, as you said, these are all my good imaginations, my small attempt<br />to predict how future would unfold.. :)</p>

<blockquote><p>  Thanks for that Vijay. However, I would like to have from Senthil at<br />least<br />  the following so that I can go through the facts myself.</p>
<p>  1. Sankarachariyar's book where he quotes kalaprayan</p>
<p>  2. 2012 - where in hindu 'prophetism' is 2012 marked as the year of<br />  destruction and death</p>
<p>  3. Who and why is it predicted that a women ruling USA would bring havoc</p>
<p>  4. On what basis are the statements 'muslims and christians will<br />fight' and<br />  'christians will try to destroy the muslim world' based on?</p>
<p>  If not for myself, I would at least like Senthil to question himself on<br />  these aspects - if he is really interested.</p>

<p>    Dear Madan<br />    I think his dialogue needs to be reversed with the base consideration<br />    ...if and only if... Hillary revisits her home prior to a decade. Lets<br />    revisit this conversation in that extreme event .<br />    Boar digging is a metaphor, it must have meant the underworld / base<br />    of universe. Adiyum mudiyum ariya thathuvam should not be compared to<br />    CA vs TN debate.<br />    The Almighty Sri Bhuvaraha murthy lifting earth from under the ocean<br />    is also symbolic of lifting dharma over samsara saagaram as one<br />theory.</p>

<p>        Its really very interesting. Some of the points i would like<br />to note<br />        are:</p>
<p>        1. Prior to islam and christianity, almost all people of this<br />planet<br />        were nature worshippers. Europe was full of tribes, with<br />indigneous<br />        culture, worshipping nature. Today, there are around 20 million<br />        paganist &amp; pantheist in europe, who are in search of their ancient<br />        roots through various literatures (particularly german<br />literature),<br />        and trying to rebuild their culture. One such is the fire worship<br />        that one of the german tribes are following.</p>
<p>        2. I remember reading one of the sankarachariyar, saying,<br />California<br />        was nothing but "Kalaprayan" (i dont know the real name).. ie,<br />in our<br />        ancient purana, one of the boar (or pig) dig the earth and<br />reached out<br />        of the other end. and if see the geographical position, california<br />        was exactly the other end of india.</p>
<p>        3. 2012 was going to be most important year for the whole<br />world. In<br />        Hindu prophetism, it was accorded as the year of destruction and<br />    havoc.<br />        Similarly, many of astrologers predicted, america is going to<br />perish,<br />        if headed by a woman.. and now hilary is certain to be elected in<br />        2008, can there be any relation b/w events.<br />        Personally, i believe, nothing happens isolated in this world...<br />        rather every event is a chain to some previous events.<br />        In that angle, considering all these, 2012 is going to be<br />auspicious.</p>
<p>        Also, its told that Hinduism will resurge, showing light to<br />the whole<br />        world.<br />        With emergence of Modi, and resurgence of saffron wave, it<br />seems to<br />        come true.</p>
<p>        My prediction is that there will be heavy fight b/w muslims &amp;         Christians, and western nations will attempt to destroy the muslim<br />        world.<br />        India may not join them, and may rather protect our muslim<br />people from<br />        such world wide backslash. Having the centre of islam<br />destructed, our<br />        muslim people will gradually merge with the mainstream thus<br />closing<br />        the cycle of history and embracing their common ancestry with<br />Hindus.<br />        (today, many of the muslims are well aware of the brahmin<br />roots, and<br />        personally &amp; secretly preserving it.

<p>      Another point I forgot to mention was the sculpture on the walls.<br />      There is a certain game, of pushing a ball through a hoop<br />    (symbolic of<br />      the cycle of the sun), if the team (comprising of the strongest of<br />      army men) cannot do so, their lead is beheaded. This is according<br />    to<br />      the guide / western archeologists.</p>
<p>      Here is the deal, a few weeks ago, we had discussed about some<br />      sculptures of kumbakonam where arms were chopped off etc, now these<br />      mayan carvings were exactly similar.</p>
<p>      People looking at the person whose head was cut were in a mode of<br />      praying and respect and the person whose head was cut had 7<br />    streams of<br />      blood gushing out (potraying 7 layers of worlds above earth -<br />      something I co-related to be 7 astral planes) and 5 streams of<br />    blood<br />      flowing from the cut head (held by the high priest) fertilizing the<br />      soil and answering to the 5 worlds below earth.<br />      It was an interesting sculpture, when i started to correlate about<br />    our<br />      own carvings. How we view it differently than considering the act<br />    as<br />      barbaric.</p>
<p>      There are more to the Mayan's, for ex: Sun God is the God of<br />    Energy,<br />      Moon is for fertility, Eagle for sight - dhoora dristi, Jaguar as a<br />      God of Power etc.<br />      Pretty much similar to Surya, Chandra, Garuda etc.</p>
<p>      Personally, I believe some mayan's moved down to more land s and</p>
<p>    mixed<br />      with Inca tribe to build maachu pichu (my next travelogue in<br />    summer,<br />      hopefully :-) ).</p>
<p>      My respect for the mayans is that they lived with Nature and<br />    believed<br />      Nature as the prime God. The first thing the spaniard christian<br />      crusaders did was to attack and burn down their temples and<br />    whatever<br />      little literature they have with it.</p>
<p>      Here is a curious note: A segment of native mayans who live, even<br />      today, in central mexico, believe the cycle of earth is to<br />    complete in<br />      2012 and the world order is to change then. For some reason, I<br />    have a<br />      feeling they may be right to some extent, considering the global<br />      challenges we have.</p>

<p>        hi,</p>
<p>        had posted on this earlier ( after watching a history channel<br />        exclusive) - the temple of inscriptions etc. aparently the<br />    mayans did<br />        not use iron /metal tools - then how did they manage to build /<br />    carve -<br />        they used a particular type of glass which was mined out of the<br />        volcanic core - this glass when shredded had such a sharp edge<br />    that<br />        today its been studied to craft surgical instruments.....</p>

<p>        Both in the Vasati temples and in the Maya pyramids the most<br />    sacred<br />        place of the whole structure is located exactly in this square.<br />    The<br />        Mayas call this area Chilambalam, which means sacred room</p>
<p>        Intrigued by the possible relationship between Maya, the Godly<br />        architect in Hindu tradition, and the Mayan people of South and<br />        Central America, he traveled throughout that region visiting<br />    ancient<br />        monuments and meeting with modern Mayan representatives.<br />    Repeatedly he<br />        was astounded by similarities between Hindu construction design<br />    and<br />        that of the Mayans, right down to the use of the same<br />    measurements and<br />        proportions. No explanation has been offered as to how this<br />    occurred,<br />        as the two peoples were never known to have been in Contact.</p>

<p>        Its really very interesting. Some of the points i would like <br />to note<br />        are:</p>
<p>        1. Prior to islam and christianity, almost all people of this <br />planet<br />        were nature worshippers. Europe was full of tribes, with <br />indigneous<br />        culture, worshipping nature. Today, there are around 20 <br />million<br />        paganist &amp; pantheist in europe, who are in search of their <br />ancient<br />        roots through various literatures (particularly german <br />literature),<br />        and trying to rebuild their culture. One such is the fire <br />worship<br />        that one of the german tribes are following.</p>
<p>        2. I remember reading one of the sankarachariyar, saying, <br />California<br />        was nothing but "Kalaprayan" (i dont know the real name).. <br />ie, in our<br />        ancient purana, one of the boar (or pig) dig the earth and <br />reached out<br />        of the other end. and if see the geographical position, <br />california<br />        was exactly the other end of india.</p>
<p>        3. 2012 was going to be most important year for the whole <br />world. In<br />        Hindu prophetism, it was accorded as the year of destruction <br />and<br />    havoc.<br />        Similarly, many of astrologers predicted, america is going to <br />perish,<br />        if headed by a woman.. and now hilary is certain to be <br />elected in<br />        2008, can there be any relation b/w events.<br />        Personally, i believe, nothing happens isolated in this <br />world...<br />        rather every event is a chain to some previous events.<br />        In that angle, considering all these, 2012 is going to be <br />auspicious.</p>
<p>        Also, its told that Hinduism will resurge, showing light to <br />the whole<br />        world.<br />        With emergence of Modi, and resurgence of saffron wave, it <br />seems to<br />        come true.</p>
<p>        My prediction is that there will be heavy fight b/w muslims &amp;         Christians, and western nations will attempt to destroy the <br />muslim<br />        world.<br />        India may not join them, and may rather protect our muslim <br />people from<br />        such world wide backslash. Having the centre of islam <br />destructed, our<br />        muslim people will gradually merge with the mainstream thus <br />closing<br />        the cycle of history and embracing their common ancestry with <br />Hindus.<br />        (today, many of the muslims are well aware of the brahmin <br />roots, and<br />        personally &amp; secretly preserving it. The same with case of <br />malaysian<br />        and indonesian leaders, secretly preserving their pre-islamic<br />    traditions)</p>

<p>            Another point I forgot to mention was the sculpture on <br />the walls.<br />            There is a certain game, of pushing a ball through a hoop<br />          (symbolic of<br />            the cycle of the sun), if the team (comprising of the <br />strongest of<br />            army men) cannot do so, their lead is beheaded. This is <br />according<br />          to<br />            the guide / western archeologists.</p>
<p>            Here is the deal, a few weeks ago, we had discussed about <br />some<br />            sculptures of kumbakonam where arms were chopped off etc, <br />now<br />    these<br />            mayan carvings were exactly similar.</p>
<p>            People looking at the person whose head was cut were in a <br />mode of<br />            praying and respect and the person whose head was cut had <br />7<br />          streams of<br />            blood gushing out (potraying 7 layers of worlds above <br />earth -<br />            something I co-related to be 7 astral planes) and 5 <br />streams of<br />          blood<br />            flowing from the cut head (held by the high priest)<br />    fertilizing the<br />            soil and answering to the 5 worlds below earth.<br />            It was an interesting sculpture, when i started to <br />correlate about<br />          our<br />            own carvings. How we view it differently than considering <br />the act<br />          as<br />            barbaric.</p>
<p>            There are more to the Mayan's, for ex: Sun God is the God <br />of<br />          Energy,<br />            Moon is for fertility, Eagle for sight - dhoora dristi, <br />Jaguar<br />    as a<br />            God of Power etc.<br />            Pretty much similar to Surya, Chandra, Garuda etc.</p>
<p>            Personally, I believe some mayan's moved down to more <br />lands and<br />          mixed<br />            with Inca tribe to build maachu pichu (my next travelogue <br />in<br />          summer,<br />            hopefully :-) ).</p>
<p>            My respect for the mayans is that they lived with Nature <br />and<br />          believed<br />            Nature as the prime God. The first thing the spaniard <br />christian<br />            crusaders did was to attack and burn down their temples <br />and<br />          whatever<br />            little literature they have with it.</p>
<p>            Here is a curious note: A segment of native mayans who <br />live, even<br />            today, in central mexico, believe the cycle of earth is to<br />          complete in<br />            2012 and the world order is to change then. For some <br />reason, I<br />          have a<br />            feeling they may be right to some extent, considering the <br />global<br />            challenges we have.</p>

<p>                I visited the Chichen Itza in Mexico earlier this <br />week, the<br />          temples<br />                and its construction was absolutely brilliant, felt <br />for<br />          sometime that<br />                I was standing in sarabeswarar temple at Tanjore <br />instead of<br />          Chichen.</p>
<p>              hi,</p>
<p>              had posted on this earlier ( after watching a history <br />channel<br />              exclusive) - the temple of inscriptions etc. aparently <br />the<br />          mayans did<br />              not use iron /metal tools - then how did they manage to <br />build /<br />          carve -<br />              they used a particular type of glass which was mined <br />out of the<br />              volcanic core - this glass when shredded had such a <br />sharp edge<br />          that<br />              today its been studied to craft surgical <br />instruments.....</p>
<p>          <a href="http://www.floridavediccollege.edu/vasati/" title="http://www.floridavediccollege.edu/vasati/">http://www.floridavediccollege.edu/vasati/</a><br />vasati_articles_mayas.htm</p>
<p>              Both in the Vasati temples and in the Maya pyramids the <br />most<br />          sacred<br />              place of the whole structure is located exactly in this <br />square.<br />          The<br />              Mayas call this area Chilambalam, which means sacred <br />room</p>
<p>              Intrigued by the possible relationship between Maya, <br />the Godly<br />              architect in Hindu tradition, and the Mayan people of <br />South and<br />              Central America, he traveled throughout that region <br />visiting<br />          ancient<br />              monuments and meeting with modern Mayan representatives.<br />          Repeatedly he<br />              was astounded by similarities between Hindu <br />construction design<br />          and<br />              that of the Mayans, right down to the use of the same<br />          measurements and<br />              proportions. No explanation has been offered as to how <br />this<br />          occurred,<br />              as the two peoples were never known to have been in <br />Contact.</p>

<p>        Its really very interesting. Some of the points i would like to note<br />        are:</p>
<p>        1. Prior to islam and christianity, almost all people of this planet<br />        were nature worshippers. Europe was full of tribes, with indigneous<br />        culture, worshipping nature. Today, there are around 20 million<br />        paganist &amp; pantheist in europe, who are in search of their ancient<br />        roots through various literatures (particularly german literature),<br />        and trying to rebuild their culture. One such is the fire worship<br />        that one of the german tribes are following.</p>
<p>        2. I remember reading one of the sankarachariyar, saying, California<br />        was nothing but "Kalaprayan" (i dont know the real name).. ie, in<br />    our<br />        ancient purana, one of the boar (or pig) dig the earth and reached<br />    out<br />        of the other end. and if see the geographical position, california<br />        was exactly the other end of india.</p>
<p>        3. 2012 was going to be most important year for the whole world. In<br />        Hindu prophetism, it was accorded as the year of destruction and<br />    havoc.<br />        Similarly, many of astrologers predicted, america is going to<br />    perish,<br />        if headed by a woman.. and now hilary is certain to be elected in<br />        2008, can there be any relation b/w events.<br />        Personally, i believe, nothing happens isolated in this world...<br />        rather every event is a chain to some previous events.<br />        In that angle, considering all these, 2012 is going to be<br />    auspicious.</p>
<p>        Also, its told that Hinduism will resurge, showing light to the<br />    whole<br />        world.<br />        With emergence of Modi, and resurgence of saffron wave, it seems to<br />        come true.</p>
<p>        My prediction is that there will be heavy fight b/w muslims &amp;         Christians, and western nations will attempt to destroy the muslim<br />        world.<br />        India may not join them, and may rather protect our muslim people<br />    from<br />        such world wide backslash. Having the centre of islam destructed,<br />    our<br />        muslim people will gradually merge with the mainstream thus closing<br />        the cycle of history and embracing their common ancestry with<br />    Hindus.<br />        (today, many of the muslims are well aware of the brahmin roots, and<br />        personally &amp; secretly preserving it.

<p>            Here is the deal, a few weeks ago, we had discussed about some<br />            sculptures of kumbakonam where arms were chopped off etc, now<br />    these<br />            mayan carvings were exactly similar.</p>
<p>            People looking at the person whose head was cut were in a mode<br />    of<br />            praying and respect and the person whose head was cut had 7<br />          streams of<br />            blood gushing out (potraying 7 layers of worlds above earth -<br />            something I co-related to be 7 astral planes) and 5 streams of<br />          blood<br />            flowing from the cut head (held by the high priest)<br />    fertilizing the<br />            soil and answering to the 5 worlds below earth.<br />            It was an interesting sculpture, when i started to correlate<br />    about<br />          our<br />            own carvings. How we view it differently than considering the<br />    act<br />          as<br />            barbaric.</p>
<p>            There are more to the Mayan's, for ex: Sun God is the God of<br />          Energy,<br />            Moon is for fertility, Eagle for sight - dhoora dristi, Jaguar<br />    as a<br />            God of Power etc.<br />            Pretty much similar to Surya, Chandra, Garuda etc.</p>
<p>            Personally, I believe some mayan's moved down to more lands and<br />          mixed<br />            with Inca tribe to build maachu pichu (my next travelogue in<br />          summer,<br />            hopefully :-) ).</p>
<p>            My respect for the mayans is that they lived with Nature and<br />          believed<br />            Nature as the prime God. The first thing the spaniard christian<br />            crusaders did was to attack and burn down their temples and<br />          whatever<br />            little literature they have with it.</p>
<p>            Here is a curious note: A segment of native mayans who live,<br />    even<br />            today, in central mexico, believe the cycle of earth is to<br />          complete in<br />            2012 and the world order is to change then. For some reason, I<br />          have a<br />            feeling they may be right to some extent, considering the global<br />            challenges we have.</p>

<p>                I visited the Chichen Itza in Mexico earlier this week, the<br />          temples<br />                and its construction was absolutely brilliant, felt for<br />          sometime that<br />                I was standing in sarabeswarar temple at Tanjore instead of<br />          Chichen.</p>
<p>              hi,</p>
<p>              had posted on this earlier ( after watching a history channel<br />              exclusive) - the temple of inscriptions etc. aparently the<br />          mayans did<br />              not use iron /metal tools - then how did they manage to build<br />    /<br />          carve -<br />              they used a particular type of glass which was mined out of<br />    the<br />              volcanic core - this glass when shredded had such a sharp edge<br />          that<br />              today its been studied to craft surgical instruments.....</p>
<p>    <a href="http://www.floridavediccollege.edu/vasati/vasati_articles_mayas.htm" title="http://www.floridavediccollege.edu/vasati/vasati_articles_mayas.htm">http://www.floridavediccollege.edu/vasati/vasati_articles_mayas.htm</a></p>
<p>              Both in the Vasati temples and in the Maya pyramids the most<br />          sacred<br />              place of the whole structure is located exactly in this<br />    square.<br />          The<br />              Mayas call this area Chilambalam, which means sacred room</p>
<p>              Intrigued by the possible relationship between Maya, the Godly<br />              architect in Hindu tradition, and the Mayan people of South<br />    and<br />              Central America, he traveled throughout that region visiting<br />          ancient<br />              monuments and meeting with modern Mayan representatives.<br />          Repeatedly he<br />              was astounded by similarities between Hindu construction<br />    design<br />          and<br />              that of the Mayans, right down to the use of the same<br />          measurements and<br />              proportions. No explanation has been offered as to how this<br />          occurred,<br />              as the two peoples were never known to have been in Contact.</p>

        <p>Thanks for that Vijay. However, I would like to have from Senthil at least<br />the following so that I can go through the facts myself.</p>
<p>1. Sankarachariyar's book where he quotes kalaprayan</p>
<p>2. 2012 - where in hindu 'prophetism' is 2012 marked as the year of<br />destruction and death</p>
<p>3. Who and why is it predicted that a women ruling USA would bring havoc</p>
<p>4. On what basis are the statements 'muslims and christians will fight' and<br />'christians will try to destroy the muslim world' based on?</p>
<p>If not for myself, I would at least like Senthil to question himself on<br />these aspects - if he is really interested.</p>

        <p>Dear Madan<br />I think his dialogue needs to be reversed with the base consideration<br />...if and only if... Hillary revisits her home prior to a decade. Lets<br />revisit this conversation in that extreme event .<br />Boar digging is a metaphor, it must have meant the underworld / base<br />of universe. Adiyum mudiyum ariya thathuvam should not be compared to<br />CA vs TN debate. <br />The Almighty Sri Bhuvaraha murthy lifting earth from under the ocean<br />is also symbolic of lifting dharma over samsara saagaram as one theory.</p>

<p>    Its really very interesting. Some of the points i would like to note<br />    are:</p>
<p>    1. Prior to islam and christianity, almost all people of this planet<br />    were nature worshippers. Europe was full of tribes, with indigneous<br />    culture, worshipping nature. Today, there are around 20 million<br />    paganist &amp; pantheist in europe, who are in search of their ancient<br />    roots through various literatures (particularly german literature),<br />    and trying to rebuild their culture. One such is the fire worship<br />    that one of the german tribes are following.</p>
<p>    2. I remember reading one of the sankarachariyar, saying, California<br />    was nothing but "Kalaprayan" (i dont know the real name).. ie, in our<br />    ancient purana, one of the boar (or pig) dig the earth and reached out<br />    of the other end. and if see the geographical position, california<br />    was exactly the other end of india.</p>
<p>    3. 2012 was going to be most important year for the whole world. In<br />    Hindu prophetism, it was accorded as the year of destruction and<br />havoc.<br />    Similarly, many of astrologers predicted, america is going to perish,<br />    if headed by a woman.. and now hilary is certain to be elected in<br />    2008, can there be any relation b/w events.<br />    Personally, i believe, nothing happens isolated in this world...<br />    rather every event is a chain to some previous events.<br />    In that angle, considering all these, 2012 is going to be auspicious.</p>
<p>    Also, its told that Hinduism will resurge, showing light to the whole<br />    world.<br />    With emergence of Modi, and resurgence of saffron wave, it seems to<br />    come true.</p>
<p>    My prediction is that there will be heavy fight b/w muslims &amp;     Christians, and western nations will attempt to destroy the muslim<br />    world.<br />    India may not join them, and may rather protect our muslim people from<br />    such world wide backslash. Having the centre of islam destructed, our<br />    muslim people will gradually merge with the mainstream thus closing<br />    the cycle of history and embracing their common ancestry with Hindus.<br />    (today, many of the muslims are well aware of the brahmin roots, and<br />    personally &amp; secretly preserving it. The same with case of malaysian<br />    and indonesian leaders, secretly preserving their pre-islamic<br />traditions)</p>

<p>        Another point I forgot to mention was the sculpture on the walls.<br />        There is a certain game, of pushing a ball through a hoop<br />      (symbolic of<br />        the cycle of the sun), if the team (comprising of the strongest of<br />        army men) cannot do so, their lead is beheaded. This is according<br />      to<br />        the guide / western archeologists.</p>
<p>        Here is the deal, a few weeks ago, we had discussed about some<br />        sculptures of kumbakonam where arms were chopped off etc, now<br />these<br />        mayan carvings were exactly similar.</p>
<p>        People looking at the person whose head was cut were in a mode of<br />        praying and respect and the person whose head was cut had 7<br />      streams of<br />        blood gushing out (potraying 7 layers of worlds above earth -<br />        something I co-related to be 7 astral planes) and 5 streams of<br />      blood<br />        flowing from the cut head (held by the high priest)<br />fertilizing the<br />        soil and answering to the 5 worlds below earth.<br />        It was an interesting sculpture, when i started to correlate about<br />      our<br />        own carvings. How we view it differently than considering the act<br />      as<br />        barbaric.</p>
<p>        There are more to the Mayan's, for ex: Sun God is the God of<br />      Energy,<br />        Moon is for fertility, Eagle for sight - dhoora dristi, Jaguar<br />as a<br />        God of Power etc.<br />        Pretty much similar to Surya, Chandra, Garuda etc.</p>
<p>        Personally, I believe some mayan's moved down to more lands and<br />      mixed<br />        with Inca tribe to build maachu pichu (my next travelogue in<br />      summer,<br />        hopefully :-) ).</p>
<p>        My respect for the mayans is that they lived with Nature and<br />      believed<br />        Nature as the prime God. The first thing the spaniard christian<br />        crusaders did was to attack and burn down their temples and<br />      whatever<br />        little literature they have with it.</p>
<p>        Here is a curious note: A segment of native mayans who live, even<br />        today, in central mexico, believe the cycle of earth is to<br />      complete in<br />        2012 and the world order is to change then. For some reason, I<br />      have a<br />        feeling they may be right to some extent, considering the global<br />        challenges we have.</p>

          Mayan civilization        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Its really very interesting. Some of the points i would like to note are:</p>
<p>1. Prior to islam and christianity, almost all people of this planet<br />were nature worshippers. Europe was full of tribes, with indigneous<br />culture, worshipping nature. Today, there are around 20 million<br />paganist &amp; pantheist in europe, who are in search of their ancient<br />roots through various literatures (particularly german literature),<br />and trying to rebuild their culture. One such is the fire worship<br />that one of the german tribes are following.</p>
<p>2. I remember reading one of the sankarachariyar, saying, California<br />was nothing but "Kalaprayan" (i dont know the real name).. ie, in our<br />ancient purana, one of the boar (or pig) dig the earth and reached out<br />of the other end. and if see the geographical position, california<br />was exactly the other end of india.</p>
<p>3. 2012 was going to be most important year for the whole world. In<br />Hindu prophetism, it was accorded as the year of destruction and havoc.<br />Similarly, many of astrologers predicted, america is going to perish,<br />if headed by a woman.. and now hilary is certain to be elected in<br />2008, can there be any relation b/w events.<br />Personally, i believe, nothing happens isolated in this world...<br />rather every event is a chain to some previous events. <br />In that angle, considering all these, 2012 is going to be auspicious.</p>
<p>Also, its told that Hinduism will resurge, showing light to the whole<br />world.<br />With emergence of Modi, and resurgence of saffron wave, it seems to<br />come true.</p>
<p>My prediction is that there will be heavy fight b/w muslims &amp; Christians, and western nations will attempt to destroy the muslim<br />world.  <br />India may not join them, and may rather protect our muslim people from<br />such world wide backslash. Having the centre of islam destructed, our<br />muslim people will gradually merge with the mainstream thus closing<br />the cycle of history and embracing their common ancestry with Hindus.<br />(today, many of the muslims are well aware of the brahmin roots, and<br />personally &amp; secretly preserving it. The same with case of malaysian<br />and indonesian leaders, secretly preserving their pre-islamic traditions)</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Senthil Raja</p>

<p>    Another point I forgot to mention was the sculpture on the walls.<br />    There is a certain game, of pushing a ball through a hoop <br />  (symbolic of<br />    the cycle of the sun), if the team (comprising of the strongest of<br />    army men) cannot do so, their lead is beheaded. This is according <br />  to<br />    the guide / western archeologists.</p>
<p>    Here is the deal, a few weeks ago, we had discussed about some<br />    sculptures of kumbakonam where arms were chopped off etc, now these<br />    mayan carvings were exactly similar.</p>
<p>    People looking at the person whose head was cut were in a mode of<br />    praying and respect and the person whose head was cut had 7 <br />  streams of<br />    blood gushing out (potraying 7 layers of worlds above earth -<br />    something I co-related to be 7 astral planes) and 5 streams of <br />  blood<br />    flowing from the cut head (held by the high priest) fertilizing the<br />    soil and answering to the 5 worlds below earth. <br />    It was an interesting sculpture, when i started to correlate about <br />  our<br />    own carvings. How we view it differently than considering the act <br />  as<br />    barbaric. </p>
<p>    There are more to the Mayan's, for ex: Sun God is the God of <br />  Energy,<br />    Moon is for fertility, Eagle for sight - dhoora dristi, Jaguar as a<br />    God of Power etc. <br />    Pretty much similar to Surya, Chandra, Garuda etc.</p>
<p>    Personally, I believe some mayan's moved down to more lands and <br />  mixed<br />    with Inca tribe to build maachu pichu (my next travelogue in <br />  summer,<br />    hopefully :-) ). </p>
<p>    My respect for the mayans is that they lived with Nature and <br />  believed<br />    Nature as the prime God. The first thing the spaniard christian<br />    crusaders did was to attack and burn down their temples and <br />  whatever<br />    little literature they have with it.</p>
<p>    Here is a curious note: A segment of native mayans who live, even<br />    today, in central mexico, believe the cycle of earth is to <br />  complete in<br />    2012 and the world order is to change then. For some reason, I <br />  have a<br />    feeling they may be right to some extent, considering the global<br />    challenges we have.</p>

        <p>dear ravi</p>
<p>heard this from a friend, maybe you know of this kind of ettiquette <br />for travel in peru.....be careful with the word chola/cholo or <br />cholita, meaning ind?gena. This may be used affectionately among <br />indigenous people (it'a very common appellation for a child, for <br />instance) but is offensive coming from an outsider. </p>

          Mayan civilization        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Another point I forgot to mention was the sculpture on the walls.<br />There is a certain game, of pushing a ball through a hoop (symbolic of<br />the cycle of the sun), if the team (comprising of the strongest of<br />army men) cannot do so, their lead is beheaded. This is according to<br />the guide / western archeologists.</p>
<p>Here is the deal, a few weeks ago, we had discussed about some<br />sculptures of kumbakonam where arms were chopped off etc, now these<br />mayan carvings were exactly similar.</p>
<p>People looking at the person whose head was cut were in a mode of<br />praying and respect and the person whose head was cut had 7 streams of<br />blood gushing out (potraying 7 layers of worlds above earth -<br />something I co-related to be 7 astral planes) and 5 streams of blood<br />flowing from the cut head (held by the high priest) fertilizing the<br />soil and answering to the 5 worlds below earth. <br />It was an interesting sculpture, when i started to correlate about our<br />own carvings. How we view it differently than considering the act as<br />barbaric. </p>
<p>There are more to the Mayan's, for ex: Sun God is the God of Energy,<br />Moon is for fertility, Eagle for sight - dhoora dristi, Jaguar as a<br />God of Power etc. <br />Pretty much similar to Surya, Chandra, Garuda etc.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe some mayan's moved down to more lands and mixed<br />with Inca tribe to build maachu pichu (my next travelogue in summer,<br />hopefully :-) ). </p>
<p>My respect for the mayans is that they lived with Nature and believed<br />Nature as the prime God. The first thing the spaniard christian<br />crusaders did was to attack and burn down their temples and whatever<br />little literature they have with it.</p>
<p>Here is a curious note: A segment of native mayans who live, even<br />today, in central mexico, believe the cycle of earth is to complete in<br />2012 and the world order is to change then. For some reason, I have a<br />feeling they may be right to some extent, considering the global<br />challenges we have.</p>

<p>  hi,</p>
<p>  had posted on this earlier ( after watching a history channel <br />  exclusive) - the temple of inscriptions etc. aparently the mayans did <br />  not use iron /metal tools - then how did they manage to build / carve -<br />  they used a particular type of glass which was mined out of the <br />  volcanic core - this glass when shredded had such a sharp edge that <br />  today its been studied to craft surgical instruments.....</p>

<p>  Both in the Vasati temples and in the Maya pyramids the most sacred <br />  place of the whole structure is located exactly in this square. The <br />  Mayas call this area Chilambalam, which means sacred room</p>

<p>  The construction and the rise of their rule (mayan) was in 600 AD <br />to<br />  1200 AD, which is pretty much the same time of our rise of II gen <br />Chozas.</p>
<p>  Though not highly developed in literature and art, their carvings <br />and<br />  construction is simply superb. Instead of a king, they were ruled <br />by a<br />  high priest called Kukulcan and here is the deal...he was seated <br />on a<br />  throne of Jaguar (their prime symbol is the Jaguar).</p>
<p>  Their acoustics in temples was brilliant. </p>
<p>  Their religious grouping was based on simple principles, our guide <br />was<br />  a mexican christian who felt it was ridiculous that the Mayan <br />thought<br />  Rain was God and Sun was God etc... </p>
<p>  The evident truth was, not much literature of Mayan, a religion<br />  without a spiritual base and not much technical superiority <br />compared<br />  to Chola dynasty, however, their construction was similar to our<br />  architecture. No one knows the answer to how the construction was<br />  done, but they do have explanation on WHY the construction was <br />done.<br />  Mayan - the name is however very indian and itza was the community <br />of<br />  Mayans who built the temple, it means Magician in ancient mayan<br />  language. End of day, all very mysterious and I was wondering with <br />the<br />  naval strengths of our guys, mexico is not far away from South asia<br />  via Japan.</p>
<p>  Anyway, it was an interesting visit and I thought some of our <br />friends<br />  here may have some insight to a comparison to the civilization.</p>
