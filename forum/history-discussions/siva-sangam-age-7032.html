</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>freinds,<br />what iam trying to say is that saivism was prevalent in sangam period. <br />but it was not included in the 18 mel kanakku. this was due to the <br />influence of jains.<br />but they were classified into 11th thirumurai later in 12th century <br />into the saiva canons. this is very much interesting. the works of <br />kabilar,baranar and nakkeerar were excluded from sangam literature on <br />religious bias.</p>
<p>saivism during sangam period is -for obvious political reasons <br />prevailing now in tamilnadu -being sidelined or not projected at all.</p>
<p>11 th thirumurai is a telling example of saivism in sangam age.</p>

        <p>I think this confuses literature with religious practise! The AIYMPERUM KAAPIYANGAL are all either Buddhist or jain only(both religions insist sanyasmin young age). But all talks about love. Seevakasindhamani is also reffered as MANANOOL since it tells about the 8 types of marriages done by Seevakan. But finally it says that he left all his wives and also his kingdom and atlast understood the good of sanyasm. <br />?I remember the story where the author of Seevakasindhamani, Thirthakadevar, was questioned to be a sage because of his writings of love and marriage in the book. Later he proved his sanyasm by touching the fire.<br />?Literatures picturises the practises of that particular time only. They can't portray a whole dream even of the author. We can't say Buddhist or jains didn't get married at all.<br />? On the whole we can't say the books are just the experiences of the author but they can also be what they heard or saw. This can't show what religion Thiruvalluvar followed. But we know well that Thiruvalluvar was married!</p>

<blockquote><p>  My personal thought - when Jainism was preaching sanyasam extensively<br />  (Rajasimha had 'Somaskandha' in all the temples only to break this<br />  Jains influence on Sanyasa, to show the common man that even god is<br />  with family and so we should not get into sanyasa just like that) how<br />  can a jain write a 'kamathu paal' one among the 3 main divisions<br />of<br />  Tirukural? Aram is ok, porul and inbam are definitely not Jains way of<br />  life? (atleast in those days. Today all Pawn brokers are Jains :) )</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>inbam -- there is a story behind Cheevakacithanmani. The writer a jain<br />wrote it as an answer when someone said Jain's cannot write above<br />kadhal. Is it Vanama munivar?? I vaguley remember that from my school<br />days. Just applying logic, if the above said incident is true, either<br />Thiruvalluvar should be a Hindu or should be later then<br />Cheevakacinthamani.</p>

<p>RE:the term kazhu-malam is used to describe seerkazhi town in <br />karikalan"s period. this term has deep saiva siddhantha connotations. <br />this town was an imperial town and it was here kari kalan was garlanded <br />by the royal elephant. it is only 12 kilometers from poompuhar.</p>
<p>so kazhu-malam means palce we get rid of the three malams namely <br />anava,kanma and maya. such a name during karikalans period and a <br />forvery important imperial town-means saiva siddhanrham was significant <br />during that period.</p>
<p>therefore i doubt this observation<br />gandhi</p>

        <p>Ravi , meat processing is gross everywhere except perhaps hygeine <br />wise, what exactly you mean by 'not kasappu kadai style'? Kosher meat?</p>
<p>I remember this mutton market in Kovai where I grew up. The goats <br />used to be held down for slaughter. Once one poor thing escaped after <br />one cut and ran into streets spilling its guts and all.... But you <br />really don't want to know too much about how food is processed for <br />some veggies either, in a way. Most keerais grow close to slums. Not <br />exactly fed by pure water.</p>
<p>Those of us who care about animal rights and find the process gross <br />have to go veggie though that is my thought too. Or just say you eat <br />meat and go ahead and eat it. I dont' understand this whole process <br />of compassion or some funny rights while killing an animal, i mean <br />what is compassionate in killing no matter how you do it? :)</p>

<p>    Hi,</p>
<p>    I some how see the message got misinterpreted some where in this <br />  big <br />    discussion. So let me try to sum up the discussion and why some <br />  points <br />    where made so that it will be clear for every one.</p>
<p>    It started out Shiva being in Sangam Literature- on that <br />discussion<br />    1. Shiva was mentioned in Sangam literature. But might not have <br />    enjoyed the same popularity as he enjoyed in later Bakthi period.<br />    2. The basis of the argument was some poets in 11th Thirumurai <br />were <br />    Sangam poets- but Historically it is proven these poets had the <br />  same <br />    name as the previous Famous Sangam poets but essentially they <br />were <br />    different poets.<br />    Which leaves us with no conclusive evidence that the Saiva <br />  Shiddantha <br />    being a popular religion during the Sangam age(but Shiva worship <br />    existed during that period - only extent of popularity is <br />unknown - <br />  as <br />    of now not very popular based on the textual evidence we have).</p>
<p>    While discussing about whether 11th Thirumurai was as old as <br />Sangam <br />    and left out only because of Jain influence, we discussed about <br />    internal evidence that a literature has. Then I gave Thirukural <br />eg. <br />    where Tamil Nadu govt gives a very early date and Internal <br />evidence <br />    telling us some different later period. Series of discussion <br />  followed <br />    this<br />    Why Thirukkural could have been a later work?<br />    I had posted the following from Smile of Murugan book.just points <br />    below,<br />    1. The language used has some new innovations which was not found <br />  in <br />    any other literature before it.(Either ur text of Tholkappiyam or <br />    Snagam literature) which technicaly makes it not earlier to these <br />    literatures. Also it had great influences of Sanskrit <br />    literatures(which have been dated) so TK was written after the <br />  period <br />    of the original Sanksrit literature.<br />    SO the lower limit is around 3rd Century - end of Sangam period.<br />    2. Then what is the upper limit. The 4th century has seen <br />flourish <br />  in <br />    Jainism and didactic literature. Thirukkural being a didactic <br />    literature and also having certain Jain philosophies should most <br />    probably fit into this period around 4th -5th century.</p>
<p>    Against this theory:<br />    Mention of Thirukkural in Manimekalai and Silapadikaram and an <br />    argument that Silapdikaram has Gayabahu mention which happens in <br />  172 <br />    AD. So Tirukkural was BC.</p>
<p>    The basis of earlier date of Thirukkural lies with Dating of <br />    Silapadikaram. But The dating of Silapadikaram is not conclusive. <br />    Most, if not all scholars date it around 5-6 th century. The <br />Dating <br />  of <br />    Silapadikaram was not discussed in detail in the forum.</p>
<p>    Meat Eating:<br />    In between this there was a pointer from Dr.S.Palaniappan thought <br />  abt <br />    TK,<br />    That meat eating principles during Sangam and TK period are <br />  different <br />    and also period after Sangam had a flourish of Jainism. So the <br />  possibility of Jain influence in meat eating could make TK around <br />4th <br />    century work. This inspired a series of discussion.</p>
<p>    Was influence of Meat eating in TK due to Hinduism or Jainism?<br />    1. This lead us to go to the root of the issue. Did Hinduism <br />  prescribe strict vegetarianism like Jainism?<br />    We came to know about lot of facts,<br />    1. In Hinduism each Varna had different rules on Meat eating.<br />    2. Brahmins just ate some prescribed parts after yagna as prasad.<br />    3. Ksharityas were allowed to eat meat.</p>
<p>    This gave us a view point that though there were severe <br />  restrictions <br />    on meat eating, there was no strict vegetarianism policy in <br />  Hinduism <br />    on the whole. <br />    At the Same time Jains had the Strict vegetarianism policy in <br />their <br />  vegetarianism. This made most of us realize the possibility that <br />    Jainsims influenced the Hindu system of meat eating and pushed <br />    Hinduism to lesser Animal sacrifice and more towards strict <br />  vegetarianism.</p>
<p>    The other Discussion was <br />    Was Valluvar a Jain?<br />    1. We didn't go much into the topic.<br />    2. We decided to end the discussion with the conclusion TK has <br />  influences/ philosophies from Sanskrit literature, Jain <br />Philosophies <br />  as well as indigenous Tamil culture.</p>
<p>    Another less useful discussion was about Masala Dosai<br />    I started out with chilli eg. that Chillis were import and came <br />to <br />    India only after 17 th century. Then we probed masala dosai and <br />  ended <br />    up with chocolates.</p>
<p>    The discussions which came up , but were not discusses to great <br />    detail:<br />    1. Valluvar Jain or Not ?<br />    2. Dating of Silapadigaram dating<br />    3. Tholkappiyam dating and authorship<br />    4. Early Brahmins meat eaters or not ?<br />    5. Animal sacrifice and Soma drink<br />    6. Thirukural presented in Sangam avai or not ?</p>
<p>    The three topics discussed in details were<br />    1. Shiva in sangam age. <br />    2. TK dating.<br />    3. Jain influence in strict vegetarianism. </p>
<p>    As always in a discussion there can be no conclusion. But at <br />least <br />    Three topics were covered in details with pros and cons. </p>
<p>    I am writing this summary so that no one misinterprets this <br />  marathon <br />    discussion reading the recent messages. </p>
<p>    Since it was marathon discussion if any one feels I have missed <br />any <br />    important points in the summary please go on and add it as a <br />reply. <br />    And in case if there were mistakes in my summary please be <br />gracious <br />    and correct it.</p>
<p>    And Thanks to so many people for giving great informations in <br />this <br />    discussion.</p>

<p>      Ravi, I agree with you completely that eating meat for survival <br />  is <br />      not at all against dharma. Also Sri Rama was kshatriya, not a <br />      brahmin. Kshatriyas did eat meat. Ramayana has some interesting <br />      observations on food, it clearly states gluttony or greedy <br />eating <br />  of <br />      food by rakshasas is obscene, not eating meat in itself. It is <br />a <br />      great moral for present day times.</p>
<p>      Durga was originally portrayed as a forest goddess. Durga <br />    worshippers <br />      or Shaktas do sacrifice animals to this day. I see nothing in <br />it <br />      other than a ritual they practice.</p>

<p>        There was one Valluvar, but many avvai's, Edaikkadar, I am <br />not <br />    sure <br />        if there was more than one.</p>
<p>        Hence the thread connects these three people into one time <br />line <br />      with <br />        two constants and one variable - logical conclusion here. <br />      Myth/legend <br />        is about the ressurrection of Kural from the pond, history is <br />    about <br />        their meeting. For the sake of this discussion, lets keep off <br />  the <br />        Kural throwing episode and stick to the meeting.</p>
<p>        Also, Lalitha sahasranama's meaning is different, I will <br />write <br />    that <br />        later. </p>
<p>        I will check with my books and acharyas on the vension meat <br />  food <br />    by <br />        Rama. I believe that the dharma clearly states that you can <br />eat <br />      food <br />        to sustain life when there is no other alternative. So If I <br />  were <br />    at <br />      a <br />        god foresaken forest and there is no edible food around, I <br />wont <br />      have <br />        choice other than to eat meat.</p>

<p>          We have discussed the 'potra marai' kulam legend/myth with <br />    Vairam <br />          before. According to myths The kural was thrown into the <br />  kulam <br />    by <br />          sangam poets who claimed a two liner was not poetry. Avvai <br />  sings <br />      to <br />          God and the kural comes up on the golden lotus with oracle <br />          saying 'valluvar vakke yem vakku'. Hence the pond even gets <br />  the <br />          name 'potramarai' kulam. But looks like valluvar/avvai did <br />  not <br />    co <br />          exist historically so it was probably a story only.</p>
<p>          On the Buddha - the Buddha did not refuse any offerings <br />  devotees <br />          made. All that a poor devotee had was some stale pork so he <br />      offered <br />          it to the Buddha who got sick after eating it and <br />eventually <br />        leading <br />          to his departure from the earth. It is only a story, not <br />          substantiated although Buddhists are not vegetarians and it <br />  is <br />      very <br />          possible it happened.</p>
<p>          Ramayana does say quite clearly that Lakshmana killed deer <br />  and <br />      all <br />        3 <br />          of them enjoyed venison(deer meat). Lalitha Saharsranama <br />  calls <br />      Devi <br />          as 'mamsanna priye..' one who loves well cooked meat. Our <br />  food <br />          preferences are not linked to religion although we may <br />assume <br />      they <br />          are.</p>

<p>            Excellent note.</p>
<p>            I have read some place that Valluvar's thirukural was <br />    presented <br />        to <br />            the Sankam by Avvai and Edaikkadar at the por thamarai <br />  kulam <br />    in <br />            Madurai.</p>
<p>            I would agree to Virarajendra's time frame.</p>
<p>            Satish: Related to your note, I think there was a thread <br />      earlier <br />          that <br />            mentioned Budha was poisoned with salted pork. Again, <br />there <br />    are <br />          many <br />            Buddhas... so either way, i am not sure of any saatvic <br />way <br />  to <br />          process <br />            pork :-) </p>

<p>              Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>              You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>              "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to <br />be <br />      born <br />        50<br />              years before Christ, but the language and the internal <br />      evidence <br />            point<br />              Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...." </p>
<p>              I am very much interested in knowing the internal <br />  evidence <br />      that <br />          you<br />              have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />          Thiruvalluver<br />              was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>              Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets <br />  Ilango <br />          Adikal <br />            and<br />              Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the <br />  Silappathikaaram <br />      and<br />              Manimekalai.</p>
<p>              Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed <br />  during <br />        the <br />            same<br />              period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital <br />  city <br />      of <br />          the<br />              Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present <br />Kodungallur <br />  of <br />            Kerala.  </p>
<p>              Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal <br />  sool <br />        Ilankai<br />              Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration <br />  ceremony <br />      of <br />          the<br />              newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at <br />Vanji <br />        Nagar. </p>
<p>              The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri <br />  Lanka <br />      who <br />          has<br />              been positively dated as ruling during the years <br />A.D.171-<br />  193</p>
<p>              Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and <br />  Manimekalai <br />      with<br />              stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of <br />  Kovalan <br />      and<br />              Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of <br />  Kovalan <br />      by<br />              Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the <br />period <br />  the <br />          Kovalan<br />              Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>              Now what is interesting is both these poets have made <br />use <br />  of <br />      the<br />              Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems. </p>
<p>              We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has <br />  made <br />      use <br />        of<br />              Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>              (1)	"?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai <br />theivam <br />            tholuthahaimai<br />              thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya <br />Kannaki <br />        vinnaka<br />              maatharkku virunthu?."<br />              (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>              (2)	"?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum <br />        pallavaiyor <br />            sollum<br />              paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan <br />thevi<br />              kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />              (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>              In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is <br />as <br />        follows.</p>
<p>              (1)	"??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal <br />peiyennap <br />        peiyum <br />            peru<br />              malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai. <br />              (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai) </p>

<p>              The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava <br />perion <br />  in <br />          Tamil <br />            Nadu.</p>
<p>              Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious <br />  work <br />    in <br />          Tamil<br />              composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of <br />      eleventh<br />              century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar <br />as <br />          follows: </p>

<p>                Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The <br />      question <br />        is <br />            use of <br />                language and other pointers. Every literature has <br />  internal <br />            evidence.</p>
<p>                Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be <br />born <br />  50 <br />          years <br />                before Christ, but the language and the internal <br />  evidence <br />        point <br />                Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. <br />  Kalithokai <br />        and <br />                Paripatal have been found of later classical age <br />  because <br />    of <br />        the <br />                language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with <br />                Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a <br />  very <br />        late <br />            work?<br />                (around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>                There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are <br />        different <br />                Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also <br />  evidence <br />    of <br />        two <br />                Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based <br />on <br />      works <br />        of <br />                Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide <br />  reference <br />    on <br />        any <br />                question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>                In a similar way it would be helpful for all other <br />  members <br />      if <br />          you <br />            can <br />                give the reference book based on which you have come <br />to <br />      your <br />                conclusion. After all this a discussion board , so <br />this <br />      would <br />          be <br />            great <br />                on your side if you can enlighten us with the books <br />  which <br />        have <br />            shaped <br />                your ideas.</p>

        <p>Early brahmins meat eaters or not: <br />According to legend/myth Sg. Agastya has had goat meat during the <br />Vaatapi episode :-)</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, if you get a chance to read the way how meat <br />is processed (its definitely not our indian kasappu kadai style) in <br />the US, I am sure we dont need a discussion to become veggie lovers :-<br />)</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi,</p>
<p>  I some how see the message got misinterpreted some where in this <br />big <br />  discussion. So let me try to sum up the discussion and why some <br />points <br />  where made so that it will be clear for every one.</p>
<p>  It started out Shiva being in Sangam Literature- on that discussion<br />  1. Shiva was mentioned in Sangam literature. But might not have <br />  enjoyed the same popularity as he enjoyed in later Bakthi period.<br />  2. The basis of the argument was some poets in 11th Thirumurai were <br />  Sangam poets- but Historically it is proven these poets had the <br />same <br />  name as the previous Famous Sangam poets but essentially they were <br />  different poets.<br />  Which leaves us with no conclusive evidence that the Saiva <br />Shiddantha <br />  being a popular religion during the Sangam age(but Shiva worship <br />  existed during that period - only extent of popularity is unknown - <br />as <br />  of now not very popular based on the textual evidence we have).</p>
<p>  While discussing about whether 11th Thirumurai was as old as Sangam <br />  and left out only because of Jain influence, we discussed about <br />  internal evidence that a literature has. Then I gave Thirukural eg. <br />  where Tamil Nadu govt gives a very early date and Internal evidence <br />  telling us some different later period. Series of discussion <br />followed <br />  this<br />  Why Thirukkural could have been a later work?<br />  I had posted the following from Smile of Murugan book.just points <br />  below,<br />  1. The language used has some new innovations which was not found <br />in <br />  any other literature before it.(Either ur text of Tholkappiyam or <br />  Snagam literature) which technicaly makes it not earlier to these <br />  literatures. Also it had great influences of Sanskrit <br />  literatures(which have been dated) so TK was written after the <br />period <br />  of the original Sanksrit literature.<br />  SO the lower limit is around 3rd Century - end of Sangam period.<br />  2. Then what is the upper limit. The 4th century has seen flourish <br />in <br />  Jainism and didactic literature. Thirukkural being a didactic <br />  literature and also having certain Jain philosophies should most <br />  probably fit into this period around 4th -5th century.</p>
<p>  Against this theory:<br />  Mention of Thirukkural in Manimekalai and Silapadikaram and an <br />  argument that Silapdikaram has Gayabahu mention which happens in <br />172 <br />  AD. So Tirukkural was BC.</p>
<p>  The basis of earlier date of Thirukkural lies with Dating of <br />  Silapadikaram. But The dating of Silapadikaram is not conclusive. <br />  Most, if not all scholars date it around 5-6 th century. The Dating <br />of <br />  Silapadikaram was not discussed in detail in the forum.</p>
<p>  Meat Eating:<br />  In between this there was a pointer from Dr.S.Palaniappan thought <br />abt <br />  TK,<br />  That meat eating principles during Sangam and TK period are <br />different <br />  and also period after Sangam had a flourish of Jainism. So the <br />possibility of Jain influence in meat eating could make TK around 4th <br />  century work. This inspired a series of discussion.</p>
<p>  Was influence of Meat eating in TK due to Hinduism or Jainism?<br />  1. This lead us to go to the root of the issue. Did Hinduism <br />prescribe strict vegetarianism like Jainism?<br />  We came to know about lot of facts,<br />  1. In Hinduism each Varna had different rules on Meat eating.<br />  2. Brahmins just ate some prescribed parts after yagna as prasad.<br />  3. Ksharityas were allowed to eat meat.</p>
<p>  This gave us a view point that though there were severe <br />restrictions <br />  on meat eating, there was no strict vegetarianism policy in <br />Hinduism <br />  on the whole. <br />  At the Same time Jains had the Strict vegetarianism policy in their <br />vegetarianism. This made most of us realize the possibility that <br />  Jainsims influenced the Hindu system of meat eating and pushed <br />  Hinduism to lesser Animal sacrifice and more towards strict <br />vegetarianism.</p>
<p>  The other Discussion was <br />  Was Valluvar a Jain?<br />  1. We didn't go much into the topic.<br />  2. We decided to end the discussion with the conclusion TK has <br />influences/ philosophies from Sanskrit literature, Jain Philosophies </p></blockquote>
<p>as well as indigenous Tamil culture.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Another less useful discussion was about Masala Dosai<br />  I started out with chilli eg. that Chillis were import and came to <br />  India only after 17 th century. Then we probed masala dosai and <br />ended <br />  up with chocolates.</p>
<p>  The discussions which came up , but were not discusses to great <br />  detail:<br />  1. Valluvar Jain or Not ?<br />  2. Dating of Silapadigaram dating<br />  3. Tholkappiyam dating and authorship<br />  4. Early Brahmins meat eaters or not ?<br />  5. Animal sacrifice and Soma drink<br />  6. Thirukural presented in Sangam avai or not ?</p>
<p>  The three topics discussed in details were<br />  1. Shiva in sangam age. <br />  2. TK dating.<br />  3. Jain influence in strict vegetarianism. </p>
<p>  As always in a discussion there can be no conclusion. But at least <br />  Three topics were covered in details with pros and cons. </p>
<p>  I am writing this summary so that no one misinterprets this <br />marathon <br />  discussion reading the recent messages. </p>
<p>  Since it was marathon discussion if any one feels I have missed any <br />  important points in the summary please go on and add it as a reply. <br />  And in case if there were mistakes in my summary please be gracious <br />  and correct it.</p>
<p>  And Thanks to so many people for giving great informations in this <br />  discussion.</p>

<p>    Ravi, I agree with you completely that eating meat for survival <br />is <br />    not at all against dharma. Also Sri Rama was kshatriya, not a <br />    brahmin. Kshatriyas did eat meat. Ramayana has some interesting <br />    observations on food, it clearly states gluttony or greedy eating <br />of <br />    food by rakshasas is obscene, not eating meat in itself. It is a <br />    great moral for present day times.</p>
<p>    Durga was originally portrayed as a forest goddess. Durga <br />  worshippers <br />    or Shaktas do sacrifice animals to this day. I see nothing in it <br />    other than a ritual they practice.</p>

<p>      There was one Valluvar, but many avvai's, Edaikkadar, I am not <br />  sure <br />      if there was more than one.</p>
<p>      Hence the thread connects these three people into one time line <br />    with <br />      two constants and one variable - logical conclusion here. <br />    Myth/legend <br />      is about the ressurrection of Kural from the pond, history is <br />  about <br />      their meeting. For the sake of this discussion, lets keep off <br />the <br />      Kural throwing episode and stick to the meeting.</p>
<p>      Also, Lalitha sahasranama's meaning is different, I will write <br />  that <br />      later. </p>
<p>      I will check with my books and acharyas on the vension meat <br />food <br />  by <br />      Rama. I believe that the dharma clearly states that you can eat <br />    food <br />      to sustain life when there is no other alternative. So If I <br />were <br />  at <br />    a <br />      god foresaken forest and there is no edible food around, I wont <br />    have <br />      choice other than to eat meat.</p>

<p>        We have discussed the 'potra marai' kulam legend/myth with <br />  Vairam <br />        before. According to myths The kural was thrown into the <br />kulam <br />  by <br />        sangam poets who claimed a two liner was not poetry. Avvai <br />sings <br />    to <br />        God and the kural comes up on the golden lotus with oracle <br />        saying 'valluvar vakke yem vakku'. Hence the pond even gets <br />the <br />        name 'potramarai' kulam. But looks like valluvar/avvai did <br />not <br />  co <br />        exist historically so it was probably a story only.</p>
<p>        On the Buddha - the Buddha did not refuse any offerings <br />devotees <br />        made. All that a poor devotee had was some stale pork so he <br />    offered <br />        it to the Buddha who got sick after eating it and eventually <br />      leading <br />        to his departure from the earth. It is only a story, not <br />        substantiated although Buddhists are not vegetarians and it <br />is <br />    very <br />        possible it happened.</p>
<p>        Ramayana does say quite clearly that Lakshmana killed deer <br />and <br />    all <br />      3 <br />        of them enjoyed venison(deer meat). Lalitha Saharsranama <br />calls <br />    Devi <br />        as 'mamsanna priye..' one who loves well cooked meat.

<p>          Excellent note.</p>
<p>          I have read some place that Valluvar's thirukural was <br />  presented <br />      to <br />          the Sankam by Avvai and Edaikkadar at the por thamarai <br />kulam <br />  in <br />          Madurai.</p>
<p>          I would agree to Virarajendra's time frame.</p>
<p>          Satish: Related to your note, I think there was a thread <br />    earlier <br />        that <br />          mentioned Budha was poisoned with salted pork. Again, there <br />  are <br />        many <br />          Buddhas... so either way, i am not sure of any saatvic way <br />to <br />        process <br />          pork :-) </p>

<p>            Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>            You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>            "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be <br />    born <br />      50<br />            years before Christ, but the language and the internal <br />    evidence <br />          point<br />            Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...." </p>
<p>            I am very much interested in knowing the internal <br />evidence <br />    that <br />        you<br />            have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />        Thiruvalluver<br />            was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>            Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets <br />Ilango <br />        Adikal <br />          and<br />            Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the <br />Silappathikaaram <br />    and<br />            Manimekalai.</p>
<p>            Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed <br />during <br />      the <br />          same<br />            period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital <br />city <br />    of <br />        the<br />            Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur <br />of <br />          Kerala.  </p>
<p>            Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal <br />sool <br />      Ilankai<br />            Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration <br />ceremony <br />    of <br />        the<br />            newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji <br />      Nagar. </p>
<p>            The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri <br />Lanka <br />    who <br />        has<br />            been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-<br />193</p>
<p>            Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and <br />Manimekalai <br />    with<br />            stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of <br />Kovalan <br />    and<br />            Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of <br />Kovalan <br />    by<br />            Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period <br />the <br />        Kovalan<br />            Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>            Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use <br />of <br />    the<br />            Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems. </p>
<p>            We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has <br />made <br />    use <br />      of<br />            Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>            (1)	"?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />          tholuthahaimai<br />            thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki <br />      vinnaka<br />            maatharkku virunthu?."<br />            (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>            (2)	"?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum <br />      pallavaiyor <br />          sollum<br />            paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />            kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />            (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>            In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as <br />      follows.</p>
<p>            (1)	"??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap <br />      peiyum <br />          peru<br />            malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai. <br />            (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai) </p>
<p>    Manimekalai <br />        it <br />          is<br />            very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was <br />    earlier <br />        than<br />            the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>            The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion <br />in <br />        Tamil <br />          Nadu.</p>
<p>            Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious <br />work <br />  in <br />        Tamil<br />            composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of <br />    eleventh<br />            century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as <br />        follows: </p>
<p>            ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori <br />    porul <br />        ithu<br />            entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun <br />muthatkavi <br />        paadiya<br />            Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul <br />nirainthon....." </p>
<p>            Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>            meaning : </p>
<p>            ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of <br />thinking <br />    of <br />        the<br />            Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) <br />Ethics <br />    and<br />            explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the <br />      poets "developing<br />            poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God <br />  Siva)<br />            appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem <br />  (of <br />          praise)<br />            and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai). </p>
<p>    Thamil<br />            Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil <br />  Nadu<br />            government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar <br />was <br />      born <br />        50<br />            years before Christ, </p>

<p>              Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The <br />    question <br />      is <br />          use of <br />              language and other pointers. Every literature has <br />internal <br />          evidence.</p>
<p>              Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born <br />50 <br />        years <br />              before Christ, but the language and the internal <br />evidence <br />      point <br />              Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. <br />Kalithokai <br />      and <br />              Paripatal have been found of later classical age <br />because <br />  of <br />      the <br />              language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with <br />              Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a <br />very <br />      late <br />          work?<br />              (around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>              There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are <br />      different <br />              Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also <br />evidence <br />  of <br />      two <br />              Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based on <br />    works <br />      of <br />              Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide <br />reference <br />  on <br />      any <br />              question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>              In a similar way it would be helpful for all other <br />members <br />    if <br />        you <br />          can <br />              give the reference book based on which you have come to <br />    your <br />              conclusion.

          siva in sangam age        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I some how see the message got misinterpreted some where in this big <br />discussion. So let me try to sum up the discussion and why some points <br />where made so that it will be clear for every one.</p>
<p>It started out Shiva being in Sangam Literature- on that discussion<br />1. Shiva was mentioned in Sangam literature. But might not have <br />enjoyed the same popularity as he enjoyed in later Bakthi period.<br />2. The basis of the argument was some poets in 11th Thirumurai were <br />Sangam poets- but Historically it is proven these poets had the same <br />name as the previous Famous Sangam poets but essentially they were <br />different poets.<br />Which leaves us with no conclusive evidence that the Saiva Shiddantha <br />being a popular religion during the Sangam age(but Shiva worship <br />existed during that period - only extent of popularity is unknown - as <br />of now not very popular based on the textual evidence we have).</p>
<p>While discussing about whether 11th Thirumurai was as old as Sangam <br />and left out only because of Jain influence, we discussed about <br />internal evidence that a literature has. Then I gave Thirukural eg. <br />where Tamil Nadu govt gives a very early date and Internal evidence <br />telling us some different later period. Series of discussion followed <br />this<br />Why Thirukkural could have been a later work?<br />I had posted the following from Smile of Murugan book.just points <br />below,<br />1. The language used has some new innovations which was not found in <br />any other literature before it.(Either ur text of Tholkappiyam or <br />Snagam literature) which technicaly makes it not earlier to these <br />literatures. Also it had great influences of Sanskrit <br />literatures(which have been dated) so TK was written after the period <br />of the original Sanksrit literature.<br />SO the lower limit is around 3rd Century - end of Sangam period.<br />2. Then what is the upper limit. The 4th century has seen flourish in <br />Jainism and didactic literature. Thirukkural being a didactic <br />literature and also having certain Jain philosophies should most <br />probably fit into this period around 4th -5th century.</p>
<p>Against this theory:<br />Mention of Thirukkural in Manimekalai and Silapadikaram and an <br />argument that Silapdikaram has Gayabahu mention which happens in 172 <br />AD. So Tirukkural was BC.</p>
<p>The basis of earlier date of Thirukkural lies with Dating of <br />Silapadikaram. But The dating of Silapadikaram is not conclusive. <br />Most, if not all scholars date it around 5-6 th century. The Dating of <br />Silapadikaram was not discussed in detail in the forum.</p>
<p>Meat Eating:<br />In between this there was a pointer from Dr.S.Palaniappan thought abt <br />TK,<br />That meat eating principles during Sangam and TK period are different <br />and also period after Sangam had a flourish of Jainism. So the possibility of Jain influence in meat eating could make TK around 4th <br />century work. This inspired a series of discussion.</p>
<p>Was influence of Meat eating in TK due to Hinduism or Jainism?<br />1. This lead us to go to the root of the issue. Did Hinduism prescribe strict vegetarianism like Jainism?<br />We came to know about lot of facts,<br />1. In Hinduism each Varna had different rules on Meat eating.<br />2. Brahmins just ate some prescribed parts after yagna as prasad.<br />3. Ksharityas were allowed to eat meat.</p>
<p>This gave us a view point that though there were severe restrictions <br />on meat eating, there was no strict vegetarianism policy in Hinduism <br />on the whole. <br />At the Same time Jains had the Strict vegetarianism policy in their vegetarianism. This made most of us realize the possibility that <br />Jainsims influenced the Hindu system of meat eating and pushed <br />Hinduism to lesser Animal sacrifice and more towards strict vegetarianism.</p>
<p>The other Discussion was <br />Was Valluvar a Jain?<br />1. We didn't go much into the topic.<br />2. We decided to end the discussion with the conclusion TK has influences/ philosophies from Sanskrit literature, Jain Philosophies as well as indigenous Tamil culture.</p>
<p>Another less useful discussion was about Masala Dosai<br />I started out with chilli eg. that Chillis were import and came to <br />India only after 17 th century. Then we probed masala dosai and ended <br />up with chocolates.</p>
<p>The discussions which came up , but were not discusses to great <br />detail:<br />1. Valluvar Jain or Not ?<br />2. Dating of Silapadigaram dating<br />3. Tholkappiyam dating and authorship<br />4. Early Brahmins meat eaters or not ?<br />5. Animal sacrifice and Soma drink<br />6. Thirukural presented in Sangam avai or not ?</p>
<p>The three topics discussed in details were<br />1. Shiva in sangam age. <br />2. TK dating.<br />3. Jain influence in strict vegetarianism. </p>
<p>As always in a discussion there can be no conclusion. But at least <br />Three topics were covered in details with pros and cons. </p>
<p>I am writing this summary so that no one misinterprets this marathon <br />discussion reading the recent messages. </p>
<p>Since it was marathon discussion if any one feels I have missed any <br />important points in the summary please go on and add it as a reply. <br />And in case if there were mistakes in my summary please be gracious <br />and correct it.</p>
<p>And Thanks to so many people for giving great informations in this <br />discussion.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Ravi, I agree with you completely that eating meat for survival is <br />  not at all against dharma. Also Sri Rama was kshatriya, not a <br />  brahmin. Kshatriyas did eat meat. Ramayana has some interesting <br />  observations on food, it clearly states gluttony or greedy eating of <br />  food by rakshasas is obscene, not eating meat in itself. It is a <br />  great moral for present day times.</p>
<p>  Durga was originally portrayed as a forest goddess. Durga <br />worshippers <br />  or Shaktas do sacrifice animals to this day. I see nothing in it <br />  other than a ritual they practice.</p>

<p>    There was one Valluvar, but many avvai's, Edaikkadar, I am not <br />sure <br />    if there was more than one.</p>
<p>    Hence the thread connects these three people into one time line <br />  with <br />    two constants and one variable - logical conclusion here. <br />  Myth/legend <br />    is about the ressurrection of Kural from the pond, history is <br />about <br />    their meeting. For the sake of this discussion, lets keep off the <br />    Kural throwing episode and stick to the meeting.</p>
<p>    Also, Lalitha sahasranama's meaning is different, I will write <br />that <br />    later. </p>

<p>          Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>          You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>          "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be <br />  born <br />    50<br />          years before Christ, but the language and the internal <br />  evidence <br />        point<br />          Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...." </p>
<p>          I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence <br />  that <br />      you<br />          have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />      Thiruvalluver<br />          was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>          Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango <br />      Adikal <br />        and<br />          Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram <br />  and<br />          Manimekalai.</p>
<p>          Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during <br />    the <br />        same<br />          period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city <br />  of <br />      the<br />          Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of <br />        Kerala.  </p>
<p>          Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool <br />    Ilankai<br />          Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony <br />  of <br />      the<br />          newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji <br />    Nagar. </p>
<p>          The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka <br />  who <br />      has<br />          been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>          Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai <br />  with<br />          stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan <br />  and<br />          Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan <br />  by<br />          Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the <br />      Kovalan<br />          Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>          Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of <br />  the<br />          Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems. </p>
<p>          We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made <br />  use <br />    of<br />          Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>          (1)	"?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />        tholuthahaimai<br />          thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki <br />    vinnaka<br />          maatharkku virunthu?."<br />          (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>          (2)	"?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum <br />    pallavaiyor <br />        sollum<br />          paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />          kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />          (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>          In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as <br />    follows.</p>
<p>          (1)	"??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap <br />    peiyum <br />        peru<br />          malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai. <br />          (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai) </p>
<p>  Manimekalai <br />      it <br />        is<br />          very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was <br />  earlier <br />      than<br />          the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>          The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in <br />      Tamil <br />        Nadu.</p>
<p>          Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work <br />in <br />      Tamil<br />          composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of <br />  eleventh<br />          century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as <br />      follows: </p>
<p>          ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori <br />  porul <br />      ithu<br />          entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi <br />      paadiya<br />          Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....." </p>
<p>          Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>          meaning : </p>
<p>          ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking <br />  of <br />      the<br />          Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics <br />  and<br />          explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the <br />    poets "developing<br />          poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God <br />Siva)<br />          appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem <br />(of <br />        praise)<br />          and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai). </p>
<p>  Thamil<br />          Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil <br />Nadu<br />          government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was <br />    born <br />      50<br />          years before Christ, </p>
<p>          Virarajendra</p>

<p>              what iam trying to say is that saivism was prevalent in <br />      sangam <br />            period. <br />              but it was not included in the 18 mel kanakku. this was  <br />    due <br />      to <br />        the <br />              influence of jains.</p>
<p>            Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The <br />  question <br />    is <br />        use of <br />            language and other pointers. Every literature has internal <br />        evidence.</p>
<p>            Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50 <br />      years <br />            before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence <br />    point <br />            Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. Kalithokai <br />    and <br />            Paripatal have been found of later classical age because <br />of <br />    the <br />            language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with <br />            Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a very <br />    late <br />        work?<br />            (around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>            There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are <br />    different <br />            Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also evidence <br />of <br />    two <br />            Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based on <br />  works <br />    of <br />            Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide reference <br />on <br />    any <br />            question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>            In a similar way it would be helpful for all other members <br />  if <br />      you <br />        can <br />            give the reference book based on which you have come to <br />  your <br />            conclusion. After all this a discussion board , so this <br />  would <br />      be <br />        great <br />            on your side if you can enlighten us with the books which <br />    have <br />        shaped <br />            your ideas.</p>

        <p>Ravi, I agree with you completely that eating meat for survival is <br />not at all against dharma. Also Sri Rama was kshatriya, not a <br />brahmin. Kshatriyas did eat meat. Ramayana has some interesting <br />observations on food, it clearly states gluttony or greedy eating of <br />food by rakshasas is obscene, not eating meat in itself. It is a <br />great moral for present day times.</p>
<p>Durga was originally portrayed as a forest goddess. Durga worshippers <br />or Shaktas do sacrifice animals to this day. I see nothing in it <br />other than a ritual they practice.</p>

<p>        Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai <br />with<br />        stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan <br />and<br />        Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan <br />by<br />        Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the <br />    Kovalan<br />        Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>        Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of <br />the<br />        Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems. </p>
<p>        We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made <br />use <br />  of<br />        Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>        (1)	"?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />      tholuthahaimai<br />        thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki <br />  vinnaka<br />        maatharkku virunthu?."<br />        (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>        (2)	"?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum <br />  pallavaiyor <br />      sollum<br />        paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />        kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />        (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>        In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as <br />  follows.</p>
<p>        (1)	"??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap <br />  peiyum <br />      peru<br />        malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai. <br />        (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai) </p>
<p>Manimekalai <br />    it <br />      is<br />        very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was <br />earlier <br />    than<br />        the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>        The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in <br />    Tamil <br />      Nadu.</p>
<p>        Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in <br />    Tamil<br />        composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of <br />eleventh<br />        century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as <br />    follows: </p>
<p>        ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori <br />porul <br />    ithu<br />        entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi <br />    paadiya<br />        Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....." </p>
<p>        Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>        meaning : </p>
<p>        ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking <br />of <br />    the<br />        Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics <br />and<br />        explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the <br />  poets "developing<br />        poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />        appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of <br />      praise)<br />        and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai). </p>
<p>Thamil<br />        Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />        government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was <br />  born <br />    50<br />        years before Christ, </p>

        <p>There was one Valluvar, but many avvai's, Edaikkadar, I am not sure <br />if there was more than one.</p>
<p>Hence the thread connects these three people into one time line with <br />two constants and one variable - logical conclusion here. Myth/legend <br />is about the ressurrection of Kural from the pond, history is about <br />their meeting. For the sake of this discussion, lets keep off the <br />Kural throwing episode and stick to the meeting.</p>
<p>Also, Lalitha sahasranama's meaning is different, I will write that <br />later. </p>
<p>I will check with my books and acharyas on the vension meat food by <br />Rama. I believe that the dharma clearly states that you can eat food <br />to sustain life when there is no other alternative. So If I were at a <br />god foresaken forest and there is no edible food around, I wont have <br />choice other than to eat meat.</p>

<blockquote><p>  We have discussed the 'potra marai' kulam legend/myth with Vairam <br />  before. According to myths The kural was thrown into the kulam by <br />  sangam poets who claimed a two liner was not poetry. Avvai sings to <br />  God and the kural comes up on the golden lotus with oracle <br />  saying 'valluvar vakke yem vakku'. Hence the pond even gets the <br />  name 'potramarai' kulam. But looks like valluvar/avvai did not co <br />  exist historically so it was probably a story only.</p>
<p>  On the Buddha - the Buddha did not refuse any offerings devotees <br />  made. All that a poor devotee had was some stale pork so he offered <br />  it to the Buddha who got sick after eating it and eventually <br />leading <br />  to his departure from the earth. It is only a story, not <br />  substantiated although Buddhists are not vegetarians and it is very <br />  possible it happened.</p>
<p>  Ramayana does say quite clearly that Lakshmana killed deer and all <br />3 <br />  of them enjoyed venison(deer meat). Lalitha Saharsranama calls Devi <br />  as 'mamsanna priye..' one who loves well cooked meat. Our food <br />  preferences are not linked to religion although we may assume they <br />  are.</p>

<p>    Excellent note.</p>
<p>    I have read some place that Valluvar's thirukural was presented <br />to <br />    the Sankam by Avvai and Edaikkadar at the por thamarai kulam in <br />    Madurai.</p>
<p>    I would agree to Virarajendra's time frame.</p>
<p>    Satish: Related to your note, I think there was a thread earlier <br />  that <br />    mentioned Budha was poisoned with salted pork. Again, there are <br />  many <br />    Buddhas... so either way, i am not sure of any saatvic way to <br />  process <br />    pork :-) </p>

<p>      Date: 17-2-2009</p>
<p>      Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>      You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>      "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born <br />50<br />      years before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence <br />    point<br />      Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...." </p>
<p>      I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence that <br />  you<br />      have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />  Thiruvalluver<br />      was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>      Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango <br />  Adikal <br />    and<br />      Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram and<br />      Manimekalai.</p>
<p>      Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during <br />the <br />    same<br />      period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city of <br />  the<br />      Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of <br />    Kerala.  </p>
<p>      Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool <br />Ilankai<br />      Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony of <br />  the<br />      newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji <br />Nagar. </p>
<p>      The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka who <br />  has<br />      been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>      Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai with<br />      stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan and<br />      Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan by<br />      Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the <br />  Kovalan<br />      Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>      Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of the<br />      Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems. </p>
<p>      We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made use <br />of<br />      Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>      (1)	"?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />    tholuthahaimai<br />      thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki <br />vinnaka<br />      maatharkku virunthu?."<br />      (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      (2)	"?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum <br />pallavaiyor <br />    sollum<br />      paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />      kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />      (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as <br />follows.</p>
<p>      (1)	"??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap <br />peiyum <br />    peru<br />      malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai. <br />      (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai) </p>
<p>  it <br />    is<br />      very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was earlier <br />  than<br />      the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>      The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in <br />  Tamil <br />    Nadu.</p>
<p>      Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in <br />  Tamil<br />      composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of eleventh<br />      century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as <br />  follows: </p>
<p>      ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori porul <br />  ithu<br />      entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi <br />  paadiya<br />      Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....." </p>
<p>      Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>      meaning : </p>
<p>      ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking of <br />  the<br />      Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics and<br />      explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the <br />poets "developing<br />      poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />      appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of <br />    praise)<br />      and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai). </p>
<p>      Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />      government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was <br />born <br />  50<br />      years before Christ, </p>

        <p>We have discussed the 'potra marai' kulam legend/myth with Vairam <br />before. According to myths The kural was thrown into the kulam by <br />sangam poets who claimed a two liner was not poetry. Avvai sings to <br />God and the kural comes up on the golden lotus with oracle <br />saying 'valluvar vakke yem vakku'. Hence the pond even gets the <br />name 'potramarai' kulam. But looks like valluvar/avvai did not co <br />exist historically so it was probably a story only.</p>
<p>On the Buddha - the Buddha did not refuse any offerings devotees <br />made. All that a poor devotee had was some stale pork so he offered <br />it to the Buddha who got sick after eating it and eventually leading <br />to his departure from the earth. It is only a story, not <br />substantiated although Buddhists are not vegetarians and it is very <br />possible it happened.</p>
<p>Ramayana does say quite clearly that Lakshmana killed deer and all 3 <br />of them enjoyed venison(deer meat). Lalitha Saharsranama calls Devi <br />as 'mamsanna priye..' one who loves well cooked meat. Our food <br />preferences are not linked to religion although we may assume they <br />are.</p>

<p>    Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>    You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>    "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50<br />    years before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence <br />  point<br />    Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...." </p>
<p>    I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence that <br />you<br />    have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />Thiruvalluver<br />    was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>    Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango <br />Adikal <br />  and<br />    Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram and<br />    Manimekalai.</p>
<p>    Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during the <br />  same<br />    period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city of <br />the<br />    Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of <br />  Kerala.  </p>
<p>    Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool Ilankai<br />    Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony of <br />the<br />    newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji Nagar. </p>
<p>    The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka who <br />has<br />    been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>    Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai with<br />    stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan and<br />    Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan by<br />    Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the <br />Kovalan<br />    Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>    Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of the<br />    Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems. </p>
<p>    We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made use of<br />    Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>    (1)	"?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />  tholuthahaimai<br />    thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki vinnaka<br />    maatharkku virunthu?."<br />    (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>    (2)	"?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor <br />  sollum<br />    paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />    kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />    (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>    In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as follows.</p>
<p>    (1)	"??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap peiyum <br />  peru<br />    malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai. <br />    (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai) </p>
<p>it <br />  is<br />    very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was earlier <br />than<br />    the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>    The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in <br />Tamil <br />  Nadu.</p>
<p>    Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in <br />Tamil<br />    composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of eleventh<br />    century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as <br />follows: </p>
<p>    ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori porul <br />ithu<br />    entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi <br />paadiya<br />    Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....." </p>
<p>    Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>    meaning : </p>
<p>    ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking of <br />the<br />    Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics and<br />    explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets "developing<br />    poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />    appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of <br />  praise)<br />    and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai). </p>
<p>    Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />    government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was born <br />50<br />    years before Christ, </p>
<p>    Virarajendra</p>

<p>      Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The question is <br />  use of <br />      language and other pointers. Every literature has internal <br />  evidence.</p>
<p>      Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50 <br />years <br />      before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence point <br />      Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. Kalithokai and <br />      Paripatal have been found of later classical age because of the <br />      language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with <br />      Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a very late <br />  work?<br />      (around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>      There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are different <br />      Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also evidence of two <br />      Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based on works of <br />      Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide reference on any <br />      question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>      In a similar way it would be helpful for all other members if <br />you <br />  can <br />      give the reference book based on which you have come to your <br />      conclusion. After all this a discussion board , so this would <br />be <br />  great <br />      on your side if you can enlighten us with the books which have <br />  shaped <br />      your ideas.</p>

        <p>Valli has offered Fish , Thinai Maavu, Then to Velavan.<br />Guha offers Fish to Rama (I am not able to find evidence if he <br />consumed the same).<br />Lord Narasimha is still offered meat at one specific temple in <br />Ahobilam.</p>
<p>What I dont understand is what this has to do with Valluvar preaching <br />vegetarianism. I am sure Valluvar did not walk the plank on each of <br />his writings. His writings exceed his life, that being said, his <br />preaching / writing was all "felt" more than walked is what I think.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  An Approximate guess from my side...my answer would be on this <br />point...<br />  Early Hindus/Aryans believed in Animal Sacrifice. Even in Ramayana <br />you<br />  can see Brahmins performing animal sacrifice. Only after arrival one<br />  Upanishads close to the end of BC (probably 2bc or later)..(I forgot<br />  the Name of the Upanishads will verify it)...the animal sacrifice <br />was<br />  replaced...replacement was that the Brahmin now presents his breath <br />as<br />  a sacrifice to the fire. The Animal was substituted by the breath of<br />  the Brahmin. This was very late development and basically after<br />  Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>  As far as I remember from school History , Ashoka after converting <br />to<br />  Buddhism asked his country men to become non meat eaters for at <br />least<br />  a day in a week.</p>
<p>standard<br />  vegetarianism. Probably there was no major rule like that Hinduism<br />  about meat eating in those period.</p>
<p>  Again this is my assumption based on few bits and pieces I have <br />read.<br />  If any one can give a more clear picture it would be helpful.</p>
<p>  And in case of Tamil Nadu... the Sangam Literature has no reference <br />of<br />  strict adherence to vegetarianism. In fact meat eating and divinity<br />  never mixed to my knowledge. Animal sacrifice was major ritual in<br />  worship of Murugan. Ram/Goat was cut in prayers to him. <br />  Then suddenly you have literature which teaches you non meat eating<br />  principles i.e Thirukural. Some where there is a missing continuity.<br />  Which suggest Thirukural cannot be earlier (along with the language<br />  evidence).<br />  It is a known fact Jainism flourished in that period followed by the<br />  revival of Vedic Hinduism in South.<br />  The Two pointers here are,<br />  Indigenous religion or southern Hinduism (before Sanskritisation)<br />  didn't have anything against meat eating.<br />  Period of flourish of Jains before revival of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
<p>  So either Vedic Hinduism influenced Southern Hinduism or Jainism <br />did.<br />  But around 4th century -6th century(end of Early sangam era - era of<br />  least influence of any other culture on south) Jainism was<br />  flourishing. So the logic suggest that Jainism had influenced Tamils<br />  in vegetarianism. </p>

<p>    Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>    You say that since Thirukkural is embedded with a lot of Jain<br />  principles, this is a 4th century work and so you feel this as <br />the<br />  correct dating. A wild question??? Why could not have the Jains<br />  copied the meateating (I mean no meateating) principles.

        <p>Excellent note.</p>
<p>I have read some place that Valluvar's thirukural was presented to <br />the Sankam by Avvai and Edaikkadar at the por thamarai kulam in <br />Madurai.</p>
<p>I would agree to Virarajendra's time frame.</p>
<p>Satish: Related to your note, I think there was a thread earlier that <br />mentioned Budha was poisoned with salted pork. Again, there are many <br />Buddhas... so either way, i am not sure of any saatvic way to process <br />pork :-) </p>

<p>  Date: 17-2-2009</p>
<p>  Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>  You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>  "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50<br />  years before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence <br />point<br />  Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...." </p>
<p>  I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence that you<br />  have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of Thiruvalluver<br />  was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>  Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango Adikal <br />and<br />  Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram and<br />  Manimekalai.</p>
<p>  Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during the <br />same<br />  period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city of the<br />  Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of <br />Kerala.  </p>
<p>  Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool Ilankai<br />  Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony of the<br />  newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji Nagar. </p>
<p>  The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka who has<br />  been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>  Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai with<br />  stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan and<br />  Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan by<br />  Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the Kovalan<br />  Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>  Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of the<br />  Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems. </p>
<p>  We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made use of<br />  Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>  (1)	"?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />tholuthahaimai<br />  thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki vinnaka<br />  maatharkku virunthu?."<br />  (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>  (2)	"?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor <br />sollum<br />  paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />  kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />  (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>  In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as follows.</p>
<p>  (1)	"??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap peiyum <br />peru<br />  malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai. <br />  (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai) </p>
<p>is<br />  very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was earlier than<br />  the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>  The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in Tamil <br />Nadu.</p>
<p>  Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in Tamil<br />  composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of eleventh<br />  century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as follows: </p>
<p>  ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori porul ithu<br />  entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi paadiya<br />  Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....." </p>
<p>  Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>  meaning : </p>
<p>  ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking of the<br />  Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics and<br />  explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets "developing<br />  poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />  appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of <br />praise)<br />  and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai). </p>
<p>  Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />  government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was born 50<br />  years before Christ, </p>

<p>      what iam trying to say is that saivism was prevalent in sangam <br />    period. <br />      but it was not included in the 18 mel kanakku. this was due to <br />the <br />      influence of jains.</p>
<p>    Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The question is <br />use of <br />    language and other pointers. Every literature has internal <br />evidence.</p>
<p>    Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50 years <br />    before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence point <br />    Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. Kalithokai and <br />    Paripatal have been found of later classical age because of the <br />    language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with <br />    Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a very late <br />work?<br />    (around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>    There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are different <br />    Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also evidence of two <br />    Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based on works of <br />    Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide reference on any <br />    question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>    In a similar way it would be helpful for all other members if you <br />can <br />    give the reference book based on which you have come to your <br />    conclusion. After all this a discussion board , so this would be <br />great <br />    on your side if you can enlighten us with the books which have <br />shaped <br />    your ideas.</p>

<p>      saivism during sangam period is -for obvious political reasons <br />      prevailing now in tamilnadu -being sidelined or not projected <br />at <br />    all.</p>
<p>      11 th thirumurai is a telling example of saivism in sangam age.</p>

<p>from <br />  left over dough, the 'filling' dishes were usually idlis or adais. <br />  Dosa was usually served with side of potatoes or some curry. The <br />  stuffing was invented by hotels in Udupi during food shortage in <br />  1930s to minimize the quantity of curry used and became a staple. </p>

        <p>European chocolatiers are great experimenters - with contrasting <br />flavors among others. Clove,cinnamon,chili are all now widely <br />combined with chocolate among other chocoloate makers also. I tasted <br />a 'chai tea' chocolote in Seattle, it was hard to say it was <br />chocoloate, tasted like a burfi from grand sweets.</p>
<p>Sorry for the diversion. Talking of contrasting flavors, nothing <br />beats 'chaat' in that regard.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>around last year a now dormant deepa prakash a member who is a food <br />scientist read the english version of Ponniyin selvan by karthik <br />narayan.<br />she raised the point of the grain MAIZE being used in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  times. she <br />pointed out maize came into india much later and could not have been <br />used a 1000 years back as was written.<br />she was right.<br />what kalki had mentioned in the tamil original was cholam a minor <br />millet an d not makka cholam which was maize. it was an error in <br />translation.</acronym></p>
<p>i guess we should list the things that came in with the europeans and <br />plan a tamil menu without them. some people still do that menu on <br />pongal day but its slowly vanishing.</p>
<p>i think the staple must have been pepper, tamarind, jaggery for the <br />taste, </p>
<p>I guess Vairam should give us a list of sangam age vegetables now <br />that he has finished with the flowers and fishes.</p>

        <p>Animal sacrifice is allowed in some yagnas; this is explained by the<br />Kanchi Shankaracharya in Deivathin Kural.A booklet published by<br />Ramakrishna Mission gives a brief description of the various yagnas,<br />including the special ones in which animals are sacrificed. Sri<br />Ramanujacharya too, I think, in Vedartha Sangraha makes a passing<br />mention of animals sacrificed in some yagnas. But the yagnas were done<br />for obtaining specific material benefits, mainly by the kings.</p>

<p>  Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  Then the most interesting question to be answered here is why Vedic<br />  brahmins/Aryans didn't eat meat?<br />  Jains mainly opposed it since it meant to murder of an living being.<br />  This principle of theirs can be tranced in them not eating anything<br />  grown down the ground and strict Jains wearing a cloth over their<br />  mouth.<br />  It is sort of well documented(Ramayana , Mahabaratha) that early<br />  Aryans/Vedic Brahmins killed animal for sacrifice. So in principle<br />  their non meat eating must have been different from that of the Jain<br />  principle of not killing any living being.</p>
<p>  Another thing to consider is Jainism was popular even during Sangam<br />  age. There are lot of Jain mountain paintings and carvings which are<br />  dated in BC in Tamil Nadu. If I am right they brought down brahmi from<br />  north to spread their religion. Also thing to note is during Ashoka<br />  period lot of northern Bhuddist Monks would entered<br />  Tamil Nadu to<br />  spread their religion. At the same though Vedic Hinduism was brought<br />  down by Brahmins, it didn't receive much wide spread popularity(early<br />  Sangam period), though it was highly respected.</p>
<p>  And again no one can be certain about unwritten history...all we can<br />  try to do is try to bring some logic and assume this must have<br />  happened.</p>
<p>  But the biggest problem which hits Indian History is No culture<br />  /religion develops in Isolation. Each culture influences the other one<br />  in a direct or indirect way. What we have in present is amalgam of so<br />  many cultures. So when we try to trace the origin of something with<br />  current perspective of things it is surely going to mislead us some<br />where.</p>

<p>    Dear Vairam</p>
<p>    Thanks for the clarification. But are we not confusing between<br />  Animal? Sacrifice- Vegetarianism- Ahimsa here.?</p>
<p>    If you see, you say that Animal? Sacrifice was done by Brahmins.<br />  Fine.? But where does it say that Brahmins? ate meat in there?<br />Again,<br />  I ask this question, only because I see that meat was a? discard<br />for<br />  the Brahmins always.? And if the Animal Sacrifice was stopped after<br />  the Jains influence,? it is only the Ahimsa principle which<br />  was? enforced strongly by the Jains, as I see. I? will even<br />agree with<br />  this. Jains and Buddhists did emphasize a lot on Ahimsa and hence<br />  these sacrifices stopped.?</p>
<p>    Regarding Sangam literature not? talking any specifics about?<br />non-<br />  meat? eating, this is precisely why I<br />  said that the Vedic? religion is<br />  somewhat different from the? Tamizh religion. I? had? written<br />earlier<br />  about the? usage of Thali in the marriage rituals.? Thali is<br />essential<br />  part of the Tamizh culture while the Vedic religion adopted it after<br />  the migration. (There was no invasion as? it is being propagated<br />  purportedly now). Also the Vedics used to burn the dead while the<br />  Tamizhs use to bury the dead.</p>
<p>    So? considering the dates of Jains influence on Tamizhs and<br />  the? possibility that Vedics would have influenced the? Tamizhs<br />even<br />  before the change could have been brought about by the Vedic Brahmins<br />  first and later? emphasized by Jains a lot. Again I only see<br />this? as<br />  another possibility as the? "discontinuity" , you pointed, is still<br />a<br />  culprit in understanding the true history.<br />    ?<br />    Regards,</p>

<p>    Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>    An Approximate guess from my side...my answer would be on this<br />  point...<br />    Early Hindus/Aryans believed in Animal Sacrifice. Even in Ramayana<br />  you<br />    can see Brahmins performing animal sacrifice. Only after arrival one<br />    Upanishads close to the end of BC (probably 2bc or later)..(I forgot<br />    the Name of the Upanishads will verify it)...the animal sacrifice<br />  was<br />    replaced...replacem ent was that the Brahmin now presents his breath<br />  as<br />    a<br />  sacrifice to the fire. The Animal was substituted by the breath of<br />    the Brahmin. This was very late development and basically after<br />    Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>    As far as I remember from school History , Ashoka after converting<br />  to<br />    Buddhism asked his country men to become non meat eaters for at<br />  least<br />    a day in a week.</p>
<p>  standard<br />    vegetarianism. Probably there was no major rule like that Hinduism<br />    about meat eating in those period.</p>
<p>    Again this is my assumption based on few bits and pieces I have<br />  read.<br />    If any one can give a more clear picture it would be helpful.</p>
<p>    And in case of Tamil Nadu... the Sangam Literature has no reference<br />  of<br />    strict adherence to vegetarianism. In fact meat eating and divinity<br />    never mixed to my knowledge. Animal sacrifice was<br />  major ritual in<br />    worship of Murugan. Ram/Goat was cut in prayers to him.<br />    Then suddenly you have literature which teaches you non meat eating<br />    principles i.e Thirukural. Some where there is a missing continuity.<br />    Which suggest Thirukural cannot be earlier (along with the language<br />    evidence).<br />    It is a known fact Jainism flourished in that period followed by the<br />    revival of Vedic Hinduism in South.<br />    The Two pointers here are,<br />    Indigenous religion or southern Hinduism (before Sanskritisation)<br />    didn't have anything against meat eating.<br />    Period of flourish of Jains before revival of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
<p>    So either Vedic Hinduism influenced Southern Hinduism or Jainism<br />  did.<br />    But around 4th century -6th century(end of Early sangam era - era of<br />    least influence of any other culture on south) Jainism was<br />    flourishing. So the logic suggest that<br />  Jainism had influenced Tamils<br />    in vegetarianism.</p>

<p>      Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>      You say that since Thirukkural is embedded with a lot of Jain<br />    principles, thisÂ? is aÂ? 4th century work andÂ? so<br />you feel this<br />  as the<br />    correctÂ? dating.Â? A wild question???Â? Why could<br />not have the<br />  Jains<br />    copied the meateating (I meanÂ? no meateating) principles. How<br />sure<br />  are<br />    you that it was theÂ? so called Hindus who copied from the<br />Jains?<br />  Just<br />    curious.</p>

        <p>Usaully when I explain people about one culture's influence over <br />another I try to take this example....</p>
<p>Chilli was brought to India only by the British from South America. So <br />technically we didn't have chillies before 1700s or even 1800s. But <br />nearly we cannot cook with out chilli these days. This is an <br />influence, a british influence in Tamil culture.</p>
<p>Still Sambar is our own dish, still kara poriyals are our dish but the <br />influencing factor was Chilli. No one can say Chilli is British <br />material hence Sambhar is British.</p>
<p>Same way we can find influences which totally shape a culture but <br />still they are only influences. TK has a Jain, Saskrit,Tamil ingredients. As far as the food is good no need to probe into the <br />master recipe!(it is also other way round...just because it is goos <br />people want to know the recipe!)</p>

        <p>Hi Satish,</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the post I would stick on to say Valluvar was knowledgeable in Jainism, Sanskrit Literature and Tamil indigenous culture. I surely wouldn't go into debate of which religion he <br />belonged to.<br />The greatness of the Literature that even after so many years every <br />body from every culture wants to claim its theirs. G.U.Pope claimed it <br />was Christian Literature.<br />TK transcends all religions and is universal truth.<br />To me only claim we can have on that Literature is as Tamilians since <br />it was written in Tamil and we should be proud about it.</p>
<p>And <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym ,<br />Thiruvalluvar dating by govt. is like Tamil New year decision. No one <br />knows the Valid reason! The basic fact is due to the reason they <br />wanted to project Tamil language as very old and before Christian era. <br />But these days we have so many epigraphic proof to show Tamil was very <br />very old.</acronym></p>
<p>And Satish on Tholkappiyam,<br />The text is one of the most interpolated books in the whole world. The <br />Ur text is dated around 100 BC but interpolations have taken place <br />even in 6th 7th century AD. And no major critical study has been done <br />on it. So it is really not safe to quote Tholkappiyam since it is <br />never been accurately dated. All we know is the original Ur text is <br />very old and many people have contributed in the interpolations.<br />And again there is another big contreversy whether Tholkappiyar is <br />Jain or not."Vaiyapuri Pillay has suggested that Tolkappiyanaar may <br />have belonged to a heterodox Jaina grammatical tradition called <br />aintiram(a view which other scholars like Burnell, Takanobu and <br />Zvelebil share) "</p>

But the argument that its a hindu literature and<br />  not a jain literature has more plus points. I dont exactly remember<br />  the source but in 2004/05 when this was discussed in our group, one<br />  member - Priya vaishnava gave beautiful arguments that Tirukural is<br />  Hindu literature and not Jain.(I cannot forget her, as she was the <br />one<br />  who inspired me to read Deivathin Kural). </p>
<p>  My personal thought - when Jainism was preaching sanyasam <br />extensively<br />  (Rajasimha had 'Somaskandha' in all the temples only to break this<br />  Jains influence on Sanyasa, to show the common man that even god is<br />  with family and so we should not get into sanyasa just like that) <br />how<br />  can a jain write a 'kamathu paal' one among the 3 main divisions of<br />  Tirukural? Aram is ok, porul and inbam are definitely not Jains way <br />of<br />  life? (atleast in those days. Today all Pawn brokers are Jains :) )</p>
<p>  Ilavarasi - I have heard the story you said, but I think Agathiyar <br />was<br />  not offered meat, but the asura was killed, burned and the ash was<br />  mixed in a drink (may be juice, I dont remember) and offered to the<br />  sage. I am not sure about which version is true but the crux is he<br />  entered the sage's stomach somehow and the sage digested him by his<br />  power. </p>

<p>[Dear Mouli, Is this what you read in manu smriti too??]</p>
<p>Anthanars as referred in the Tamizh texts is not the same as Brahmins of Vedic culture. AnthaNar = am+thaN+ar. thaN is being cool (namma Rajini style) those who were very much reachable and believable or in clear terms "noble" were called anthaNars. Later, this term became synonymous with Brahmins. Remember Vairam's saying that Vedic Culture and the Brahmins were respected by the Tamizhs. This respect, I think, led to the synonymisation (I dontknow if this is the correct word ) of?"anthaNar" with Brahmins.</p>

<p>Thanks Vairam for this reference. I remember writing this long back,<br />but here its evident that 'Soma' is a plant (mooligai) which was<br />actually used to prepare 'Soma Panam'. Its not liquor as propagated by<br />'intellectuals', who claim that Brahmin's used to drink and make<br />merry. Its a mooligai drink prepared for yagams and consumed as<br />prasadam. Its actually a health drink and not alcohol or arrack as<br />widely propagated.</p>

        <p>Beautiful pointers Vairam et al..</p>
<p>Ahimsa was not new to Hinduism and it was very much preached by the<br />vedas. Saying that Jainism and buddhism only taught Ahimsa is not<br />true. But for sure these sects had a great influence on the Hindu way<br />of life.</p>
<p>Hinduism was not against meat eating. As the members pointed,<br />sacrifices were common. It might not seem right in today's context but<br />on philosophical levels it had great inner meanings. Brahmins did<br />consume meat, but not as food but only as prasadam from yagnas. Vedas<br />specify what animal and what part exactly should be used and only a<br />pepper sized meat from that particular part of the animals body was<br />consumed, not eaten but directly swallowed by brahmins, as prasadam<br />(source Maha periyava in 'Deivathin Kural')</p>
<p>Since Jainism and Bhuddism started taking prominence, Hindus way of<br />life was influenced by these religion and slowly sacrifices were<br />reduced. these should the period under discussion.</p>
<p>I am not sure about vedic Hinduism's influence in Tamil culture and<br />definitely not during the 2 BC to 5AD, because, if I am correct,<br />Tholkappiyam which is the oldest of sangam literature (some say it is<br />from 2500 BC) has references to vedas and 'anthanars'. Experts can<br />correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Buddhist do eat meat. As per Buddhism, a monk should only eat by<br />taking biksha and should not refuse anything that is offered. So even<br />Buddha himself have consumed meat, when it is offered to him, as he<br />should not say no to what is given to him as biksha. This concept was<br />modified a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  and thats why we see the Chinese and Japanese Buddhist<br />do eat everything that has life. :)</acronym></p>
<p>Influence of Jainism and Buddism on Tirukural - this is a highly<br />debatable thing and I think there are lots of arguments and counter<br />arguments for this. But the argument that its a hindu literature and<br />not a jain literature has more plus points. I dont exactly remember<br />the source but in 2004/05 when this was discussed in our group, one<br />member - Priya vaishnava gave beautiful arguments that Tirukural is<br />Hindu literature and not Jain.(I cannot forget her, as she was the one<br />who inspired me to read Deivathin Kural). </p>
<p>My personal thought - when Jainism was preaching sanyasam extensively<br />(Rajasimha had 'Somaskandha' in all the temples only to break this<br />Jains influence on Sanyasa, to show the common man that even god is<br />with family and so we should not get into sanyasa just like that) how<br />can a jain write a 'kamathu paal' one among the 3 main divisions of<br />Tirukural? Aram is ok, porul and inbam are definitely not Jains way of<br />life? (atleast in those days. Today all Pawn brokers are Jains :) )</p>
<p>Ilavarasi - I have heard the story you said, but I think Agathiyar was<br />not offered meat, but the asura was killed, burned and the ash was<br />mixed in a drink (may be juice, I dont remember) and offered to the<br />sage. I am not sure about which version is true but the crux is he<br />entered the sage's stomach somehow and the sage digested him by his<br />power. </p>

        <p>Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>Looks agreeable. But sorry, one more confusion. How did the TN government fix the date for Thiruvalluvar as 50 years before the birth of Christ? Just Curious to see the other perspective.<br /> <br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>Yeah <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym  thats my point, Though Rama was Kshtriya he was a Hindu. I <br />pointed that out to say Hinduism accepted Meat eaters.</acronym></p>
<p>Thirukkural Dating - one thing for sure is, it is after Sangam due to <br />language evidence. The next thing to note is, if its after Sangam then <br />when was it actually written.</p>
<p>So when you probe it you get two sets of events,<br />One th Didactic period in Tamil Literature. Inna Narpathu Iniyavai <br />narpathu , naladiyar,naan mani kadigai etc etc... all telling what you <br />should do and what you shouldn't<br />next is the flourishing Jain religion under Kalabhras between end of <br />Sangam and starting of Bakthi period.</p>
<p>Also there are lot references of Jain philosophies in TK ..(I am not <br />going into the bigger topic of whether Valluvar was Jain or not <br />)..Valluvar was knowledgeable in Sanskrit literature and Jain philosophies as well as all Tamil culture is a safer bet...</p>
<p>So Dr.Zvelebil and other scholars come to conclusion that it must be <br />written in the didactic period i.e 4-6th century. There are many <br />scholars who date it differently but none to my knowledge before BC. <br />Some have dated it even to 10 AD.</p>
<p>But at present at scholars circle Dr.Zvelebil' s dating is widely accepted since it makes more sense than any other dating and logic. If <br />some one comes out with better reasoning then we should move on to <br />that , but till that time Dr.Zvelebil' s dating is a safer and <br />considerably accurate dating!</p>

<p>  Another thing to note here is we are not going totally into issue of <br />  meat eating of Brahmins.<br />  I just remember VJ telling me some time ago that Rama was meat eater <br />  in Ramayana. This simply means that Hinduism accepted meat eating, <br />  While Jains and Buddhists very strictly opposed it.</p>
<p>  "The soma sacrifice was the most important and could last up to <br />twelve <br />  years. Since the soma plant was imported from distant mountains, it <br />  had to be purchased. A ritual drama re-enacted this business and <br />  aggressive Aryan history by showing the buyer snatching back the <br />calf, <br />  which was paid for the soma plant, after the transaction occurs. The <br />  soma plant was then placed in a cart and welcomed as an honored <br />guest <br />  and king at the sacrifice. Animals were slain and cut up in the <br />rites <br />  before their meat was eaten. After various offerings and other <br />  ceremonies the soma juice is poured and toasted to different gods, <br />and <br />  finally the text lists the sacrificial fees, usually goats, cows, <br />  gold, clothes, and food."<br />  <a href="http://www.san" title="http://www.san">http://www.san</a>. beck.org/ EC7-Vedas. html</p>
<p>  The above text I surutified from net , clearly shows that in <br />Hinduism <br />  meat eating was accepted though might not been endorsed. </p>
<p>  Whether Brahmins ate meat or not is not the topic here to my <br />  knowledge. Brahmins participated in such rituals as priests. And <br />hence <br />  I feel strict vegetarianism principle should have been an influence <br />  outside of the religion.</p>

<p>    Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>    Then the most interesting question to be answered here is why <br />Vedic <br />    brahmins/Aryans didn't eat meat? <br />    Jains mainly opposed it since it meant to murder of an living <br />being. <br />    This principle of theirs can be tranced in them not eating <br />anything <br />    grown down the ground and strict Jains wearing a cloth over their <br />    mouth.<br />    It is sort of well documented(Ramayana , Mahabaratha) that early <br />    Aryans/Vedic Brahmins killed animal for sacrifice. So in principle <br />    their non meat eating must have been different from that of the <br />Jain <br />    principle of not killing any living being.</p>
<p>    Another thing to consider is Jainism was popular even during <br />Sangam <br />    age. There are lot of Jain mountain paintings and carvings which <br />are <br />    dated in BC in Tamil Nadu. If I am right they brought down brahmi <br />  from <br />    north to spread their religion. Also thing to note is during <br />Ashoka <br />    period lot of northern Bhuddist Monks would entered<br />    Tamil Nadu to <br />    spread their religion. At the same though Vedic Hinduism was <br />brought <br />    down by Brahmins, it didn't receive much wide spread <br />  popularity(early <br />    Sangam period), though it was highly respected.</p>
<p>    And again no one can be certain about unwritten history...all we <br />can <br />    try to do is try to bring some logic and assume this must have <br />    happened.</p>
<p>    But the biggest problem which hits Indian History is No culture <br />    /religion develops in Isolation. Each culture influences the other <br />  one <br />    in a direct or indirect way. What we have in present is amalgam of <br />  so <br />    many cultures. So when we try to trace the origin of something <br />with <br />    current perspective of things it is surely going to mislead us <br />some <br />  where.</p>

<p>      Dear Vairam</p>
<p>      Thanks for the clarification. But are we not confusing between <br />    AnimalÃ‚Â Sacrifice- Vegetarianism- Ahimsa here.Ã‚Â </p>
<p>      If you see, you say that AnimalÃ‚Â Sacrifice was done by <br />Brahmins. <br />    Fine.Ã‚Â But where does it say that BrahminsÃ‚Â ate meat in there? <br />  Again, <br />    I ask this question, only because I see that meat was aÃ‚Â discard <br />for <br />    the Brahmins always.Ã‚Â And if the Animal Sacrifice was stopped <br />after <br />    the Jains influence,Ã‚Â it is only the Ahimsa principle which <br />    wasÃ‚Â enforced strongly by the Jains, as I see.IÃ‚Â will even <br />agree <br />  with <br />    this. Jains and Buddhists did emphasize a lot on Ahimsa and hence <br />    these sacrifices stopped.Ã‚Â  </p>
<p>      Regarding Sangam literature notÃ‚Â talking anyspecifics <br />aboutÃ‚Â non-<br />    meatÃ‚Â eating, this is precisely why I<br />    said that the VedicÃ‚Â religion is <br />    somewhat different from theÃ‚Â Tamizh religion. <br />IÃ‚Â hadÃ‚Â written <br />  earlier <br />    about theÃ‚Â usage of Thali in the marriage rituals.Ã‚Â Thali is <br />  essential <br />    part of the Tamizh culture while the Vedic religion adopted it <br />after <br />    the migration. (There was no invasion asÃ‚Â it is being propagated <br />    purportedly now). Also the Vedics used to burn the dead while the <br />    Tamizhs use to bury the dead.</p>
<p>      SoÃ‚Â considering the dates of Jains influenceon Tamizhs and <br />    theÃ‚Â possibility that Vedics would have influenced <br />theÃ‚Â Tamizhs even <br />    before the change could have been brought about by the Vedic <br />  Brahmins <br />    first and laterÃ‚Â emphasized by Jains a lot.

<p>      Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>      An Approximate guess from my side...my answer would be on this <br />    point...<br />      Early Hindus/Aryans believed in Animal Sacrifice. Even in <br />Ramayana <br />    you<br />      can see Brahmins performing animal sacrifice. Only after arrival <br />  one<br />      Upanishads close to the end of BC (probably 2bc or later)..(I <br />  forgot<br />      the Name of the Upanishads will verify it)...the animal <br />sacrifice <br />    was<br />      replaced...replacem ent was that the Brahmin now presents his <br />  breath <br />    as<br />      a<br />    sacrifice to the fire. The Animal was substituted by the breath of<br />      the Brahmin. This was very late development and basically after<br />      Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>      As far as I remember from school History , Ashoka after <br />converting <br />    to<br />      Buddhism asked his country men to become non meat eaters for at <br />    least<br />      a day in a week.</p>
<p>    standard<br />      vegetarianism. Probably there was no major rule like that <br />Hinduism<br />      about meat eating in those period.</p>
<p>      Again this is my assumption based on few bits and pieces I have <br />    read.<br />      If any one can give a more clear picture it would be helpful.</p>
<p>      And in case of Tamil Nadu... the Sangam Literature has no <br />  reference <br />    of<br />      strict adherence to vegetarianism. In fact meat eating and <br />  divinity<br />      never mixed to my knowledge. Animal sacrifice was<br />    major ritual in<br />      worship of Murugan. Ram/Goat was cut in prayers to him. <br />      Then suddenly you have literature which teaches you non meat <br />  eating<br />      principles i.e Thirukural. Some where there is a missing <br />  continuity.<br />      Which suggest Thirukural cannot be earlier (along with the <br />  language<br />      evidence).<br />      It is a known fact Jainism flourished in that period followed by <br />  the<br />      revival of Vedic Hinduism in South.<br />      The Two pointers here are,<br />      Indigenous religion or southern Hinduism (before <br />Sanskritisation)<br />      didn't have anything against meat eating.<br />      Period of flourish of Jains before revival of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
<p>      So either Vedic Hinduism influenced Southern Hinduism or Jainism <br />    did.<br />      But around 4th century -6th century(end of Early sangam era - <br />era <br />  of<br />      least influence of any other culture on south) Jainism was<br />      flourishing. So the logic suggest that<br />    Jainism had influenced Tamils<br />      in vegetarianism. </p>

        <p>Yeah <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym  thats my point, Though Rama was Kshtriya he was a Hindu. I <br />pointed that out to say Hinduism accepted Meat eaters.</acronym></p>
<p>Thirukkural Dating - one thing for sure is, it is after Sangam due to <br />language evidence. The next thing to note is, if its after Sangam then <br />when was it actually written.</p>
<p>So when you probe it you get two sets of events,<br />One th Didactic period in Tamil Literature. Inna Narpathu Iniyavai <br />narpathu , naladiyar,naan mani kadigai etc etc... all telling what you <br />should do and what you shouldn't<br />next is the flourishing Jain religion under Kalabhras between end of <br />Sangam and starting of Bakthi period.</p>
<p>Also there are lot references of Jain philosophies in TK ..(I am not <br />going into the bigger topic of whether Valluvar was Jain or not <br />)..Valluvar was knowledgeable in Sanskrit literature and Jain philosophies as well as all Tamil culture is a safer bet...</p>
<p>So Dr.Zvelebil and other scholars come to conclusion that it must be <br />written in the didactic period i.e 4-6th century. There are many <br />scholars who date it differently but none to my knowledge before BC. <br />Some have dated it even to 10 AD.</p>
<p>But at present at scholars circle Dr.Zvelebil's dating is widely accepted since it makes more sense than any other dating and logic. If <br />some one comes out with better reasoning then we should move on to <br />that , but till that time Dr.Zvelebil's dating is a safer and <br />considerably accurate dating!</p>

<p>  Another thing to note here is we are not going totally into issue of <br />  meat eating of Brahmins.<br />  I just remember VJ telling me some time ago that Rama was meat eater <br />  in Ramayana. This simply means that Hinduism accepted meat eating, <br />  While Jains and Buddhists very strictly opposed it.</p>
<p>  "The soma sacrifice was the most important and could last up to <br />twelve <br />  years. Since the soma plant was imported from distant mountains, it <br />  had to be purchased. A ritual drama re-enacted this business and <br />  aggressive Aryan history by showing the buyer snatching back the <br />calf, <br />  which was paid for the soma plant, after the transaction occurs. The <br />  soma plant was then placed in a cart and welcomed as an honored <br />guest <br />  and king at the sacrifice. Animals were slain and cut up in the <br />rites <br />  before their meat was eaten. After various offerings and other <br />  ceremonies the soma juice is poured and toasted to different gods, <br />and <br />  finally the text lists the sacrificial fees, usually goats, cows, <br />  gold, clothes, and food."<br />  <a href="http://www.san" title="http://www.san">http://www.san</a>. beck.org/ EC7-Vedas. html</p>
<p>  The above text I surutified from net , clearly shows that in <br />Hinduism <br />  meat eating was accepted though might not been endorsed. </p>
<p>  Whether Brahmins ate meat or not is not the topic here to my <br />  knowledge. Brahmins participated in such rituals as priests. And <br />hence <br />  I feel strict vegetarianism principle should have been an influence <br />  outside of the religion.</p>

<p>    Dear Vairam,<br />     <br />    Agreed. In fact Mouli's message corrected my views on the <br />  Vegetarianism. If what he said was true (I believe him though) then <br />  I agree to your views that Vegetarianism  amongst the so called <br />Hindus <br />  was the influence of Jains.<br />     <br />    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>    Then the most interesting question to be answered here is why <br />Vedic <br />    brahmins/Aryans didn't eat meat? <br />    Jains mainly opposed it since it meant to murder of an living <br />being. <br />    This principle of theirs can be tranced in them not eating <br />anything <br />    grown down the ground and strict Jains wearing a cloth over their <br />    mouth.<br />    It is sort of well documented(Ramayana , Mahabaratha) that early <br />    Aryans/Vedic Brahmins killed animal for sacrifice. So in principle <br />    their non meat eating must have been different from that of the <br />Jain <br />    principle of not killing any living being.</p>
<p>    Another thing to consider is Jainism was popular even during <br />Sangam <br />    age. There are lot of Jain mountain paintings and carvings which <br />are <br />    dated in BC in Tamil Nadu. If I am right they brought down brahmi <br />  from <br />    north to spread their religion. Also thing to note is during <br />Ashoka <br />    period lot of northern Bhuddist Monks would entered<br />    Tamil Nadu to <br />    spread their religion. At the same though Vedic Hinduism was <br />brought <br />    down by Brahmins, it didn't receive much wide spread <br />  popularity(early <br />    Sangam period), though it was highly respected.</p>
<p>    And again no one can be certain about unwritten history...all we <br />can <br />    try to do is try to bring some logic and assume this must have <br />    happened.</p>
<p>    But the biggest problem which hits Indian History is No culture <br />    /religion develops in Isolation. Each culture influences the other <br />  one <br />    in a direct or indirect way. What we have in present is amalgam of <br />  so <br />    many cultures. So when we try to trace the origin of something <br />with <br />    current perspective of things it is surely going to mislead us <br />some <br />  where.</p>

<p>      Dear Vairam</p>
<p>      Thanks for the clarification. But are we not confusing between <br />    AnimalÂ Sacrifice- Vegetarianism- Ahimsa here.Â </p>
<p>      If you see, you say that AnimalÂ Sacrifice was done by <br />Brahmins. <br />    Fine.Â But where does it say that BrahminsÂ ate meat in there? <br />  Again, <br />    I ask this question, only because I see that meat was aÂ discard <br />for <br />    the Brahmins always.Â And if the Animal Sacrifice was stopped <br />after <br />    the Jains influence,Â it is only the Ahimsa principle which <br />    wasÂ enforced strongly by the Jains, as I see. IÂ will even <br />agree <br />  with <br />    this. Jains and Buddhists did emphasize a lot on Ahimsa and hence <br />    these sacrifices stopped.Â  </p>
<p>      Regarding Sangam literature notÂ talking any specifics <br />aboutÂ non-<br />    meatÂ eating, this is precisely why I<br />    said that the VedicÂ religion is <br />    somewhat different from theÂ Tamizh religion. <br />IÂ hadÂ written <br />  earlier <br />    about theÂ usage of Thali in the marriage rituals.Â Thali is <br />  essential <br />    part of the Tamizh culture while the Vedic religion adopted it <br />after <br />    the migration. (There was no invasion asÂ it is being propagated <br />    purportedly now). Also the Vedics used to burn the dead while the <br />    Tamizhs use to bury the dead.</p>
<p>      SoÂ considering the dates of Jains influence on Tamizhs and <br />    theÂ possibility that Vedics would have influenced <br />theÂ Tamizhs even <br />    before the change could have been brought about by the Vedic <br />  Brahmins <br />    first and laterÂ emphasized by Jains a lot. Again I only see <br />  thisÂ as <br />    another possibility as theÂ "discontinuity" , you pointed, is <br />still <br />  a <br />    culprit in understanding the true history.<br />      Â <br />      Regards,</p>

        <p>Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>Regarding the example of Rama, please note that He was a Kshatriya. I know for sure Hinduism, per se, did not prohibit meat-eating. Rama, as a Kshatriya, was indeed supposed to eat meat. </p>
<p>But as you say the topic is not on whether Brahmins ate meat earlier. Sorry for diverting the topic. Let us come back to dating of Thiruvalluvar. </p>

<p>Another thing to note here is we are not going totally into issue of <br />meat eating of Brahmins.<br />I just remember VJ telling me some time ago that Rama was meat eater <br />in Ramayana. This simply means that Hinduism accepted meat eating, <br />While Jains and Buddhists very strictly opposed it.</p>
<p>"The soma sacrifice was the most important and could last up to twelve <br />years. Since the soma plant was imported from distant mountains, it <br />had to be purchased. A ritual drama re-enacted this business and <br />aggressive Aryan history by showing the buyer snatching back the calf, <br />which was paid for the soma plant, after the transaction occurs. The <br />soma plant was then placed in a cart and welcomed as an honored guest <br />and king at the sacrifice. Animals were slain and cut up in the rites <br />before their meat was eaten. After various offerings and other <br />ceremonies the soma juice is poured and toasted to different gods, and <br />finally the text lists the sacrificial fees, usually goats, cows, <br />gold, clothes, and food."<br /><a href="http://www.san" title="http://www.san">http://www.san</a>. beck.org/ EC7-Vedas. html</p>
<p>The above text I surutified from net , clearly shows that in Hinduism <br />meat eating was accepted though might not been endorsed. </p>
<p>Whether Brahmins ate meat or not is not the topic here to my <br />knowledge. Brahmins participated in such rituals as priests. And hence <br />I feel strict vegetarianism principle should have been an influence <br />outside of the religion.</p>

<p>  Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  Then the most interesting question to be answered here is why Vedic <br />  brahmins/Aryans didn't eat meat? <br />  Jains mainly opposed it since it meant to murder of an living being. <br />  This principle of theirs can be tranced in them not eating anything <br />  grown down the ground and strict Jains wearing a cloth over their <br />  mouth.<br />  It is sort of well documented(Ramayana , Mahabaratha) that early <br />  Aryans/Vedic Brahmins killed animal for sacrifice. So in principle <br />  their non meat eating must have been different from that of the Jain <br />  principle of not killing any living being.</p>
<p>  Another thing to consider is Jainism was popular even during Sangam <br />  age. There are lot of Jain mountain paintings and carvings which are <br />  dated in BC in Tamil Nadu. If I am right they brought down brahmi <br />from <br />  north to spread their religion. Also thing to note is during Ashoka <br />  period lot of northern Bhuddist Monks would entered<br />  Tamil Nadu to <br />  spread their religion. At the same though Vedic Hinduism was brought <br />  down by Brahmins, it didn't receive much wide spread <br />popularity(early <br />  Sangam period), though it was highly respected.</p>
<p>  And again no one can be certain about unwritten history...all we can <br />  try to do is try to bring some logic and assume this must have <br />  happened.</p>
<p>  But the biggest problem which hits Indian History is No culture <br />  /religion develops in Isolation. Each culture influences the other <br />one <br />  in a direct or indirect way. What we have in present is amalgam of <br />so <br />  many cultures. So when we try to trace the origin of something with <br />  current perspective of things it is surely going to mislead us some <br />where.</p>

<p>    Dear Vairam</p>
<p>    Thanks for the clarification. But are we not confusing between <br />  AnimalÂ Sacrifice- Vegetarianism- Ahimsa here.Â </p>

<p>    SoÂ considering the dates of Jains influence on Tamizhs and <br />  theÂ possibility that Vedics would have influenced theÂ Tamizhs even <br />  before the change could have been brought about by the Vedic <br />Brahmins <br />  first and laterÂ emphasized by Jains a lot.

<p>    Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>    An Approximate guess from my side...my answer would be on this <br />  point...<br />    Early Hindus/Aryans believed in Animal Sacrifice. Even in Ramayana <br />  you<br />    can see Brahmins performing animal sacrifice. Only after arrival <br />one<br />    Upanishads close to the end of BC (probably 2bc or later)..(I <br />forgot<br />    the Name of the Upanishads will verify it)...the animal sacrifice <br />  was<br />    replaced...replacem ent was that the Brahmin now presents his <br />breath <br />  as<br />    a<br />  sacrifice to the fire. The Animal was substituted by the breath of<br />    the Brahmin. This was very late development and basically after<br />    Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>    As far as I remember from school History , Ashoka after converting <br />  to<br />    Buddhism asked his country men to become non meat eaters for at <br />  least<br />    a day in a week.</p>
<p>  standard<br />    vegetarianism. Probably there was no major rule like that Hinduism<br />    about meat eating in those period.</p>
<p>    Again this is my assumption based on few bits and pieces I have <br />  read.<br />    If any one can give a more clear picture it would be helpful.</p>
<p>    And in case of Tamil Nadu... the Sangam Literature has no <br />reference <br />  of<br />    strict adherence to vegetarianism. In fact meat eating and <br />divinity<br />    never mixed to my knowledge. Animal sacrifice was<br />  major ritual in<br />    worship of Murugan. Ram/Goat was cut in prayers to him. <br />    Then suddenly you have literature which teaches you non meat <br />eating<br />    principles i.e Thirukural. Some where there is a missing <br />continuity.<br />    Which suggest Thirukural cannot be earlier (along with the <br />language<br />    evidence).<br />    It is a known fact Jainism flourished in that period followed by <br />the<br />    revival of Vedic Hinduism in South.<br />    The Two pointers here are,<br />    Indigenous religion or southern Hinduism (before Sanskritisation)<br />    didn't have anything against meat eating.<br />    Period of flourish of Jains before revival of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
<p>    So either Vedic Hinduism influenced Southern Hinduism or Jainism <br />  did.<br />    But around 4th century -6th century(end of Early sangam era - era <br />of<br />    least influence of any other culture on south) Jainism was<br />    flourishing. So the logic suggest that<br />  Jainism had influenced Tamils<br />    in vegetarianism. </p>

<p>      Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>      You say that since Thirukkural is embedded with a lot of Jain<br />    principles, thisÃ‚Â is aÃ‚Â 4th century work andÃ‚Â so you feel <br />this <br />  as the<br />    correctÃ‚Â dating.Ã‚Â  A wild question???Ã‚Â Why could not have <br />the <br />  Jains<br />    copied the meateating (I meanÃ‚Â no meateating) principles.

<p>    An Approximate guess from my side...my answer would be on this <br />  point...<br />    Early Hindus/Aryans believed in Animal Sacrifice. Even in Ramayana <br />  you<br />    can see Brahmins performing animal sacrifice. Only after arrival <br />one<br />    Upanishads close to the end of BC (probably 2bc or later)..(I <br />forgot<br />    the Name of the Upanishads will verify it)...the animal sacrifice <br />  was<br />    replaced...replacem ent was that the Brahmin now presents his <br />breath <br />  as<br />    a<br />  sacrifice to the fire. The Animal was substituted by the breath of<br />    the Brahmin. This was very late development and basically after<br />    Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>    As far as I remember from school History , Ashoka after converting <br />  to<br />    Buddhism asked his country men to become non meat eaters for at <br />  least<br />    a day in a week.</p>
<p>  standard<br />    vegetarianism. Probably there was no major rule like that Hinduism<br />    about meat eating in those period.</p>
<p>    Again this is my assumption based on few bits and pieces I have <br />  read.<br />    If any one can give a more clear picture it would be helpful.</p>
<p>    And in case of Tamil Nadu... the Sangam Literature has no <br />reference <br />  of<br />    strict adherence to vegetarianism. In fact meat eating and <br />divinity<br />    never mixed to my knowledge. Animal sacrifice was<br />  major ritual in<br />    worship of Murugan. Ram/Goat was cut in prayers to him. <br />    Then suddenly you have literature which teaches you non meat <br />eating<br />    principles i.e Thirukural. Some where there is a missing <br />continuity.<br />    Which suggest Thirukural cannot be earlier (along with the <br />language<br />    evidence).<br />    It is a known fact Jainism flourished in that period followed by <br />the<br />    revival of Vedic Hinduism in South.<br />    The Two pointers here are,<br />    Indigenous religion or southern Hinduism (before Sanskritisation)<br />    didn't have anything against meat eating.<br />    Period of flourish of Jains before revival of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
<p>    So either Vedic Hinduism influenced Southern Hinduism or Jainism <br />  did.<br />    But around 4th century -6th century(end of Early sangam era - era <br />of<br />    least influence of any other culture on south) Jainism was<br />    flourishing. So the logic suggest that<br />  Jainism had influenced Tamils<br />    in vegetarianism. </p>

        <p>I remember something about Agathiar's story. A asuran Vaathabi got the boonthat he can regain his life even when cut into pieces. He used this to kill the sages living there. Vaathabi will change himself into a goat and his friend would cook him to food. Then he would call a sage for a feast that asage should not deny(SIRARTHA BOJANAM). At last when Agathiar was trapped to?it he digested the goat by calling the power of?Lord Vinayaga. This story shows that even sages ate meat on those days. One question. Are sagesthe fore fathers of Brahmins??</p>

<p>Are you sure about this?<br />I was reading manusmriti last week and i could understand that brahmins were allowed to eat meat. But only of certain animals. Also, in 'Engey Brahmaman' by Cho, he opines that during the vedic times, it was not uncommon for the brahmins to hv meat.<br />Now im confused :)</p>

<p>Dear Vairam<br />?<br />Thanks for the clarification. But are we not confusing between Animal?Sacrifice-Vegetaria nism-Ahimsa here.?<br />?<br />If you see, you say that Animal?Sacrifice was done by Brahmins. Fine.?But where does it say that Brahmins?ate meat in there? Again, I ask this question, only because I see that meat was a?discard for the Brahmins always.?And if the Animal Sacrifice was stopped after the Jains influence,?it is only the Ahimsa principle which was?enforced strongly by the Jains,as I see. I?will even agree with this. Jains and Buddhists did emphasizea lot on Ahimsa and hence these sacrifices stopped.? <br />?<br />Regarding Sangam literature not?talking any specifics about?non-meat?eating, this is precisely why I said that the Vedic?religion is somewhat different from the?Tamizh religion. I?had?written earlier about the?usage of Thali in the marriage rituals.?Thali is essential part of theTamizh culture while the Vedic religion adopted it after the migration. (There was no invasion as?it is being propagated purportedly now). Also theVedics used to burn the dead while the Tamizhs use to bury the dead.<br />?<br />So?considering the dates of Jains influence on Tamizhs and the?possibility that Vedics would have influenced the?Tamizhs even before the change could have been brought about by the Vedic Brahmins first and later?emphasized by Jains a lot. Again I only see this?as another possibility as the?"discontinuity" , you pointed, is still a culprit in understanding the true history.<br />?<br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>Agreed. In fact Mouli's message corrected my views on the Vegetarianism. If what he said was true (I believe him though) then I agree to your views that Vegetarianism amongst the so called Hinduswas the influence of Jains.<br /> <br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Then the most interesting question to be answered here is why Vedic <br />brahmins/Aryans didn't eat meat? <br />Jains mainly opposed it since it meant to murder of an living being. <br />This principle of theirs can be tranced in them not eating anything <br />grown down the ground and strict Jains wearing a cloth over their <br />mouth.<br />It is sort of well documented(Ramayana , Mahabaratha) that early <br />Aryans/Vedic Brahmins killed animal for sacrifice. So in principle <br />their non meat eating must have been different from that of the Jain <br />principle of not killing any living being.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is Jainism was popular even during Sangam <br />age. There are lot of Jain mountain paintings and carvings which are <br />dated in BC in Tamil Nadu. If I am right they brought down brahmi from <br />north to spread their religion. Also thing to note is during Ashoka <br />period lot of northern Bhuddist Monks would entered Tamil Nadu to <br />spread their religion. At the same though Vedic Hinduism was brought <br />down by Brahmins, it didn't receive much wide spread popularity(early <br />Sangam period), though it was highly respected.</p>
<p>And again no one can be certain about unwritten history...all we can <br />try to do is try to bring some logic and assume this must have <br />happened.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem which hits Indian History is No culture <br />/religion develops in Isolation. Each culture influences the other one <br />in a direct or indirect way. What we have in present is amalgam of so <br />many cultures. So when we try to trace the origin of something with <br />current perspective of things it is surely going to mislead us some where.</p>

<p>Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Then the most interesting question to be answered here is why Vedic <br />brahmins/Aryans didn't eat meat? <br />Jains mainly opposed it since it meant to murder of an living being. <br />This principle of theirs can be tranced in them not eating anything <br />grown down the ground and strict Jains wearing a cloth over their <br />mouth.<br />It is sort of well documented(Ramayana , Mahabaratha) that early <br />Aryans/Vedic Brahmins killed animal for sacrifice. So in principle <br />their non meat eating must have been different from that of the Jain <br />principle of not killing any living being.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is Jainism was popular even during Sangam <br />age. There are lot of Jain mountain paintings and carvings which are <br />dated in BC in Tamil Nadu. If I am right they brought down brahmi from <br />north to spread their religion. Also thing to note is during Ashoka <br />period lot of northern Bhuddist Monks would entered<br />Tamil Nadu to <br />spread their religion. At the same though Vedic Hinduism was brought <br />down by Brahmins, it didn't receive much wide spread popularity(early <br />Sangam period), though it was highly respected.</p>
<p>And again no one can be certain about unwritten history...all we can <br />try to do is try to bring some logic and assume this must have <br />happened.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem which hits Indian History is No culture <br />/religion develops in Isolation. Each culture influences the other one <br />in a direct or indirect way. What we have in present is amalgam of so <br />many cultures. So when we try to trace the origin of something with <br />current perspective of things it is surely going to mislead us some where.</p>

<p>I ask this question, only because I see that meat was a discard for <br />the Brahmins always. And if the Animal Sacrifice was stopped after <br />the Jains influence, it is only the Ahimsa principle which <br />was enforced strongly by the Jains, as I see. I will even agree with <br />this. Jains and Buddhists did emphasize a lot on Ahimsa and hence <br />these sacrifices stopped.  </p>

<p>said that the Vedic religion is <br />somewhat different from the Tamizh religion.

(There was no invasion as it is being propagated <br />purportedly now). Also the Vedics used to burn the dead while the <br />Tamizhs use to bury the dead.</p>
<blockquote><p>  So considering the dates of Jains influence on Tamizhs and <br />the possibility that Vedics would have influenced the Tamizhs even </p></blockquote>
<p>before the change could have been brought about by the Vedic Brahmins <br />first and later emphasized by Jains a lot. Again I only see this as <br />another possibility as the "discontinuity" , you pointed, is still a <br />culprit in understanding the true history.</p>

<p>  Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  An Approximate guess from my side...my answer would be on this <br />point...<br />  Early Hindus/Aryans believed in Animal Sacrifice. Even in Ramayana <br />you<br />  can see Brahmins performing animal sacrifice. Only after arrival one<br />  Upanishads close to the end of BC (probably 2bc or later)..(I forgot<br />  the Name of the Upanishads will verify it)...the animal sacrifice <br />was<br />  replaced...replacem ent was that the Brahmin now presents his breath <br />as<br />  a<br />sacrifice to the fire. The Animal was substituted by the breath of<br />  the Brahmin. This was very late development and basically after<br />  Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>  As far as I remember from school History , Ashoka after converting <br />to<br />  Buddhism asked his country men to become non meat eaters for at <br />least<br />  a day in a week.</p>
<p>standard<br />  vegetarianism. Probably there was no major rule like that Hinduism<br />  about meat eating in those period.</p>
<p>  Again this is my assumption based on few bits and pieces I have <br />read.<br />  If any one can give a more clear picture it would be helpful.</p>
<p>  And in case of Tamil Nadu... the Sangam Literature has no reference <br />of<br />  strict adherence to vegetarianism. In fact meat eating and divinity<br />  never mixed to my knowledge. Animal sacrifice was<br />major ritual in<br />  worship of Murugan. Ram/Goat was cut in prayers to him. <br />  Then suddenly you have literature which teaches you non meat eating<br />  principles i.e Thirukural. Some where there is a missing continuity.<br />  Which suggest Thirukural cannot be earlier (along with the language<br />  evidence).<br />  It is a known fact Jainism flourished in that period followed by the<br />  revival of Vedic Hinduism in South.<br />  The Two pointers here are,<br />  Indigenous religion or southern Hinduism (before Sanskritisation)<br />  didn't have anything against meat eating.<br />  Period of flourish of Jains before revival of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
<p>  So either Vedic Hinduism influenced Southern Hinduism or Jainism <br />did.<br />  But around 4th century -6th century(end of Early sangam era - era of<br />  least influence of any other culture on south) Jainism was<br />  flourishing. So the logic suggest that<br />Jainism had influenced Tamils<br />  in vegetarianism. </p>

        <p>Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Then the most interesting question to be answered here is why Vedic <br />brahmins/Aryans didn't eat meat? <br />Jains mainly opposed it since it meant to murder of an living being. <br />This principle of theirs can be tranced in them not eating anything <br />grown down the ground and strict Jains wearing a cloth over their <br />mouth.<br />It is sort of well documented(Ramayana, Mahabaratha) that early <br />Aryans/Vedic Brahmins killed animal for sacrifice. So in principle <br />their non meat eating must have been different from that of the Jain <br />principle of not killing any living being.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is Jainism was popular even during Sangam <br />age. There are lot of Jain mountain paintings and carvings which are <br />dated in BC in Tamil Nadu. If I am right they brought down brahmi from <br />north to spread their religion. Also thing to note is during Ashoka <br />period lot of northern Bhuddist Monks would entered Tamil Nadu to <br />spread their religion. At the same though Vedic Hinduism was brought <br />down by Brahmins, it didn't receive much wide spread popularity(early <br />Sangam period), though it was highly respected.</p>
<p>And again no one can be certain about unwritten history...all we can <br />try to do is try to bring some logic and assume this must have <br />happened.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem which hits Indian History is No culture <br />/religion develops in Isolation. Each culture influences the other one <br />in a direct or indirect way. What we have in present is amalgam of so <br />many cultures. So when we try to trace the origin of something with <br />current perspective of things it is surely going to mislead us some where.</p>

<p>  Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  An Approximate guess from my side...my answer would be on this <br />point...<br />  Early Hindus/Aryans believed in Animal Sacrifice. Even in Ramayana <br />you<br />  can see Brahmins performing animal sacrifice. Only after arrival one<br />  Upanishads close to the end of BC (probably 2bc or later)..(I forgot<br />  the Name of the Upanishads will verify it)...the animal sacrifice <br />was<br />  replaced...replacem ent was that the Brahmin now presents his breath <br />as<br />  a sacrifice to the fire. The Animal was substituted by the breath of<br />  the Brahmin. This was very late development and basically after<br />  Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>  As far as I remember from school History , Ashoka after converting <br />to<br />  Buddhism asked his country men to become non meat eaters for at <br />least<br />  a day in a week.</p>
<p>standard<br />  vegetarianism. Probably there was no major rule like that Hinduism<br />  about meat eating in those period.</p>
<p>  Again this is my assumption based on few bits and pieces I have <br />read.<br />  If any one can give a more clear picture it would be helpful.</p>
<p>  And in case of Tamil Nadu... the Sangam Literature has no reference <br />of<br />  strict adherence to vegetarianism. In fact meat eating and divinity<br />  never mixed to my knowledge. Animal sacrifice was major ritual in<br />  worship of Murugan. Ram/Goat was cut in prayers to him. <br />  Then suddenly you have literature which teaches you non meat eating<br />  principles i.e Thirukural. Some where there is a missing continuity.<br />  Which suggest Thirukural cannot be earlier (along with the language<br />  evidence).<br />  It is a known fact Jainism flourished in that period followed by the<br />  revival of Vedic Hinduism in South.<br />  The Two pointers here are,<br />  Indigenous religion or southern Hinduism (before Sanskritisation)<br />  didn't have anything against meat eating.<br />  Period of flourish of Jains before revival of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
<p>  So either Vedic Hinduism influenced Southern Hinduism or Jainism <br />did.<br />  But around 4th century -6th century(end of Early sangam era - era of<br />  least influence of any other culture on south) Jainism was<br />  flourishing. So the logic suggest that Jainism had influenced Tamils<br />  in vegetarianism. </p>

<p>Are you sure about this?<br />I was reading manusmriti last week and i could understand that brahmins were allowed to eat meat. But only of certain animals.
