      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Vairam</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification. But are we not confusing between Animal Sacrifice-Vegetarianism-Ahimsa here. </p>
<p>If you see, you say that Animal Sacrifice was done by Brahmins. Fine. But where does it say that Brahmins ate meat in there? Again, I ask this question, only because I see that meat was a discard for the Brahmins always. And if the Animal Sacrifice was stopped after the Jains influence, it is only the Ahimsa principle which was enforced strongly by the Jains, as I see. I will even agree with this. Jains and Buddhists did emphasize a lot on Ahimsa and hence these sacrifices stopped.  </p>
<p>Regarding Sangam literature not talking any specifics about non-meat eating, this is precisely why I said that the Vedic religion is somewhat different from the Tamizh religion. I had written earlier about the usage of Thali in the marriage rituals. Thaliis essential part of the Tamizh culture while the Vedic religion adopted it after the migration. (There was no invasion as it is being propagated purportedly now). Also the Vedics used to burn the dead while the Tamizhsuse to bury the dead.</p>
<p>So considering the dates of Jains influence on Tamizhs and the possibility that Vedics would have influenced the Tamizhs even before the change could have been brought about by the Vedic Brahmins first and later emphasized by Jains a lot. Again I only see this as another possibility as the "discontinuity", you pointed, is still a culprit in understanding the true history.<br /> <br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>An Approximate guess from my side...my answer would be on this point...<br />Early Hindus/Aryans believed in Animal Sacrifice. Even in Ramayana you<br />can see Brahmins performing animal sacrifice. Only after arrival one<br />Upanishads close to the end of BC (probably 2bc or later)..(I forgot<br />the Name of the Upanishads will verify it)...the animal sacrifice was<br />replaced...replacem ent was that the Brahmin now presents his breath as<br />a sacrifice to the fire. The Animal was substituted by the breath of<br />the Brahmin. This was very late development and basically after<br />Buddhism and Jainism.</p>
<p>As far as I remember from school History , Ashoka after converting to<br />Buddhism asked his country men to become non meat eaters for at least<br />a day in a week.</p>
<p>vegetarianism. Probably there was no major rule like that Hinduism<br />about meat eating in those period.</p>
<p>Again this is my assumption based on few bits and pieces I have read.<br />If any one can give a more clear picture it would be helpful.</p>
<p>And in case of Tamil Nadu... the Sangam Literature has no reference of<br />strict adherence to vegetarianism. In fact meat eating and divinity<br />never mixed to my knowledge. Animal sacrifice was major ritual in<br />worship of Murugan. Ram/Goat was cut in prayers to him. <br />Then suddenly you have literature which teaches you non meat eating<br />principles i.e Thirukural. Some where there is a missing continuity.<br />Which suggest Thirukural cannot be earlier (along with the language<br />evidence).<br />It is a known fact Jainism flourished in that period followed by the<br />revival of Vedic Hinduism in South.<br />The Two pointers here are,<br />Indigenous religion or southern Hinduism (before Sanskritisation)<br />didn't have anything against meat eating.<br />Period of flourish of Jains before revival of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
<p>So either Vedic Hinduism influenced Southern Hinduism or Jainism did.<br />But around 4th century -6th century(end of Early sangam era - era of<br />least influence of any other culture on south) Jainism was<br />flourishing. So the logic suggest that Jainism had influenced Tamils<br />in vegetarianism. </p>

        <p>Venketesh Sir,</p>
<p>Yes, it is one of the 108 divya desams. The one in Madurai city is also a divya desam. It is called the Koodal-azhagar koil. In the pAsurams it is called as "thirukkUdal" while the KaLLazhagar kOil is always called "ThirumAlirunchOlai".</p>
<p>The one in the city is where Periyazhwar is said to have debated and established the supremity of Narayana and started singing "pallANdu pallANdu" which, even now, forms the first verses of recital on any occasion.<br /> <br />Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>dear Vinjamoor Venkatesh </p>
<p>is Azhagar Koil one of the 108 thirupathis.<br />also i saw another alagar koil in madurai city?<br />whats the history?</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<p>is mentioned even in Silappadhikaaram etc which is <br />atleast 600 years before the Madurai Nayaks time. And it is mentioned <br />as temple of Vishnu only.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Vinayagar is very common in any temple. We can see a lot of Vishnu <br />temples with Vinayagar. Thiruvallikkeni Parthasarathy Temple, </p></blockquote>
<p>Kanchipuram Varadarajar Temple, et al are just a few examples. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Namam for Saivite deity in Vishnu temple or Sandhanam with Kunguma <br />pottu for Vishnu in Saivite temples are just out of the local </p></blockquote>
<p>tradition of the temple. No other sanctity for it.</p>

Some where there is a missing continuity.<br />Which suggest Thirukural cannot be earlier (along with the language<br />evidence).<br />It is a known fact Jainism flourished in that period followed by the<br />revival of Vedic Hinduism in South.<br />The Two pointers here are,<br />Indigenous religion or southern Hinduism (before Sanskritisation)<br />didn't have anything against meat eating.<br />Period of flourish of Jains before revival of Vedic Hinduism.</p>
<p>So either Vedic Hinduism influenced Southern Hinduism or Jainism did.<br />But around 4th century -6th century(end of Early sangam era - era of<br />least influence of any other culture on south) Jainism was<br />flourishing. So the logic suggest that Jainism had influenced Tamils<br />in vegetarianism. </p>

<p>What are the evidences for this claim? On the contrary I see that Azhagar Koil is mentioned even in Silappadhikaaram etc which is atleast 600 years before the Madurai Nayaks time. And it is mentioned as temple of Vishnu only.</p>
<p>Vinayagar is very common in any temple. We can see a lot of Vishnu temples with Vinayagar. Thiruvallikkeni Parthasarathy Temple, Kanchipuram Varadarajar Temple, et al are just a few examples. </p>

        <p>Im very glad " VAIRAM"  [ I salute you , sir! ] has stated that there were many  ' Auvaiyaar' s and many ' Nakeerar's.</p>
<p>1) the Auvaiyaar who wrote those great tamil works lke aathi choodi, ? kondrai Ventan' etc, IS  very different from the lady of Paari's era. (andis said to be 3rd Auvaiyar) <br />2 the TIRUMURUGAATRUPADAI  mentions specifially the PRESENT AARU PADAIVEEDU GAL .  I could never accept that a Sangam period Pulavar could be specific in that 1- 3 CE era can mention specific temples which precededthe stone temple era , started by Parameswara Pallavan - at Kuram- now completely lost[ father of Parameswaran the 2nd also known as Rajasimhan of  ' shore temple and ' Kanchi Kailasanathar temple ' fame ].<br />BUT, a Nakkirar of 7- 9 CE can clearly discuss these 6 temples. By the way,much of these temples were improved by the late Sando Sinnapa Devar of movieland fame, BUT, in 1981, [when I first visited these 6 temples ], the temple of the 6th Padai veedu, Pazhamuthir Cholai was a mere shack- the instrangience of the administrators of Alagar Kovil [ ' the land / owners/ gaurdians] blocked every body , even S S Devar. Now of course things are improved...<br />from Ellaar See ( L R C )</p>

        <p>VERY GOOD INPUT.<br />WILL CHECK OTHER SOURCES TOO.</p>

<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vairam" <vairam@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  On Thirukural Dating,<br />  Internal evidence which suggest later age of Thirukkural according <br />to <br />  Dr.Zvelebil in his most famous book ' Smile of Murugan'.</p>
<p>  " A number of important grammatical innovations occur in the <br />language <br />  of this text when compared with early old Tamil of classical <br />period: <br />  the plural suffis -kal is used with bouth nouns of higher and <br />lower <br />  class(cf.263 marraiyavarkal,9191 puriyarkal); the conditional <br />suffix -<br />  el occurs frequently (368 untel,655 ceyvanel , 566 inrel etc.) <br />  negative forms in -amal belong to invotations too (101,103 <br />ceyyamal, <br />  1024 culamal) there are more of such features which show that , <br />  Thirukkural cannot be contemporaneous with (or older than) the <br />  "Cankam" poems but later."</p>
<p>  "There is definitely a hiher percentage of sanskrit loan words in <br />  Thirukkural than in Tolkappiyam and in the "Cankam" works. A <br />compelete <br />  list is given in S.Vaiyapuri pillai's Tamilccutarmanikal pp 72-73."</p>
<p>  Zvelebil goes on to list all these words and differs with <br />Vayapuri's <br />  number of 137 words and rather suggest around 100 words. Which is <br />  still higher compared to Sangam age.</p>
<p>  "A few of the metaphors in the text seem to be loan translations <br />from <br />  Sanskrit, e.g.piravip perun katal " the ocean of rebirths": <br />Sanskrit <br />  Samsarasagara - Just as there is a not negligible influence of <br />  sanskrit vocabulary on Thiruvalluvar's lexis, the author of the <br />Kural <br />  is undoubtedly to some extent indebted to Sanskritic sources like <br />  Manavadharamasastra, Kautily's work etc. Thus Thirukural 43 is <br />almost <br />  a Translation of Manav. iii . 72, Thirukkural 54 is vauge echo of <br />  Manav. ix.12. Thiruk. 58 od Manav. v.155, Thiruk. 396 about <br />learning <br />  has a parallel in Manav. ii. 212. Thiruk. 501 (the method of <br />testing <br />  candidates for ministerial office) is based undoubtedly on <br />Kautilya <br />  I.10 (upadha-"the moral test"), Thiruk. 385 mentions the same four <br />  kinds of acts of a kind as those started in Manav. vii.99,100 and <br />  Kamandaka I.20 etc. How ever ,this is, in itself, of great <br />  importance,it would be foolish to deny Thiruvalluvar, a mind so <br />  universal,cultured,learned and eclectic, knew these basic <br />Sanskritic <br />  sources on dharma and niti . He was without doubt a part of one <br />great <br />  Indian ethical,didactic tradition. It is more important that he <br />was <br />  also integral part of the non-Sanskritic and pre-Sanskritic Tamil <br />  Tradition; this fact is seen not only from his conception of <br />  "pleasure" which so typically a reflection of the akam genre, but <br />also <br />  from the all prevading pragmatic, this -wordly, emperical and ,to <br />  agreat extent, humanisitic and universalistic character of his <br />  particular conception of Dharma and Niti."</p>
<p>  Smile of Murugan page 169-171.</p>
<p>  There are more details on Dating of Thirukkural in his "Tamil <br />  Literature" and "Companion study to History of Tamil Literature" <br />  books. Tired of Typing now will post the details in that book soon.</p>
<p>  Further reading on Language of Thirukkural <br />  " FOr compelete Linguistic analysis of the text cf. <br />  J.J.Glazov,Morphemic Analysis of the language of Thirukkural, in  <br />  Introduction to Historical Grammar of Tamil Language, <br />Moscow,1967,113-<br />  176."</p>

<p>    Hi Vairam,</p>
<p>    One question, the spread of Jain is around 4 CE - agreed. How <br />does<br />    this related to Thirkural? I have heard it has traces of Jainism <br />in<br />    it, Thirukural itself need not to be written when Jainism spread <br />in<br />    TN. Jainism orginated in India around 6BCE, it could have spread <br />in <br />  TN<br />    in 4th CE, but people might have started following it much <br />earlier<br />    than that right? So, only the spread of Jainism is the basis to <br />put<br />    Thirukural as 4CE?</p>

<p>      "As regards teaching of history, it is pathetic. If you read <br />  Zvelebil,<br />      he will date Tiruvalluvar to ca. 4th century AD. I consider <br />that <br />  to be<br />      right. Tirukkural shows the spread of Jain principles as the <br />ideal<br />      throughout the society even though they might not have been <br />  followed<br />      in practice. Also, the attitude towards meateating in TK is <br />very<br />      different from that found in Purananuru, etc. But Tamil <br />  enthusiasts<br />      push back the date of Tiruvalluvar. In 2005, I was one of the <br />  editors<br />      of the souvenir for the FETNA convention. A person/friend who <br />  wrote an<br />      article refused to change the date of Tiruvalluvar. So we had <br />to <br />  add a<br />      disclaimer in the front stating that the contents of the <br />articles<br />      reflect the opinions of authors and not the opinions of the <br />  editors."</p>

<p>           Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>           You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>           "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be <br />  born<br />      50</p>
<p>           years before Christ, but the language and the internal <br />  evidence<br />       point<br />           Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...."</p>
<p>           I am very much interested in knowing the internal <br />evidence <br />  that<br />       you<br />           have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of<br />       Thiruvalluver<br />           was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>           Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets <br />Ilango<br />      Adikal<br />       and<br />           Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the <br />Silappathikaaram <br />  and<br />           Manimekalai.</p>
<p>           Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed <br />during <br />  the<br />       same<br />           period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital <br />city <br />  of<br />       the<br />           Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of<br />      Kerala.</p>
<p>           Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool<br />      Ilankai<br />           Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration <br />ceremony <br />  of<br />       the<br />           newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji <br />  Nagar.</p>
<p>           The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri <br />Lanka <br />  who<br />       has<br />           been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-<br />193</p>
<p>           Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and <br />Manimekalai <br />  with<br />           stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of <br />Kovalan <br />  and<br />           Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of <br />Kovalan <br />  by<br />           Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period <br />the<br />       Kovalan<br />           Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>           Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use <br />of <br />  the<br />           Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems.</p>
<p>           We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has <br />made <br />  use<br />      of<br />           Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>           (1) "?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam<br />       tholuthahaimai<br />           thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki<br />      vinnaka<br />           maatharkku virunthu?."<br />           (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>           (2) "?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum <br />pallavaiyor<br />       sollum<br />           paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />           kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />           (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>           In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as<br />      follows.</p>
<p>           (1) "??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap <br />  peiyum<br />       peru<br />           malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai.<br />           (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai)</p>
<p>  Manimekalai<br />      it<br />       is<br />           very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was <br />  earlier<br />       than<br />           the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>           The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion <br />in<br />      Tamil<br />       Nadu.</p>
<p>           Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work <br />in<br />      Tamil<br />           composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of <br />  eleventh<br />           century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as<br />      follows:</p>
<p>           ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori <br />  porul<br />       ithu<br />           entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun <br />muthatkavi<br />       paadiya<br />           Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul <br />nirainthon....."</p>
<p>           Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>           meaning :</p>
<p>           ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of <br />thinking <br />  of<br />       the<br />           Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) <br />Ethics <br />  and<br />           explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets<br />      "developing<br />           poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God <br />  Siva)<br />           appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem <br />(of<br />       praise)<br />           and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai).</p>
<p>  Thamil<br />           Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil <br />Nadu<br />           government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar <br />was <br />  born<br />       50<br />           years before Christ,</p>

<p>        Date: 17-2-2009</p>
<p>        Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>        You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>        "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born <br />50</p>
<p>        years before Christ, but the language and the internal <br />evidence <br />    point<br />        Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...."</p>
<p>        I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence <br />that <br />    you<br />        have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />    Thiruvalluver<br />        was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>        Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango <br />Adikal <br />    and<br />        Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram <br />and<br />        Manimekalai.</p>
<p>        Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during <br />the <br />    same<br />        period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city <br />of <br />    the<br />        Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of <br />Kerala.</p>
<p>        Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool <br />Ilankai<br />        Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony <br />of <br />    the<br />        newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji <br />Nagar.</p>
<p>        The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka <br />who <br />    has<br />        been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>        Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai <br />with<br />        stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan <br />and<br />        Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan <br />by<br />        Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the <br />    Kovalan<br />        Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>        Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of <br />the<br />        Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems.</p>
<p>        We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made <br />use of<br />        Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>        (1) "?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />    tholuthahaimai<br />        thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki <br />vinnaka<br />        maatharkku virunthu?."<br />        (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>        (2) "?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor <br />    sollum<br />        paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />        kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />        (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>        In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as <br />follows.</p>
<p>        (1) "??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap <br />peiyum <br />    peru<br />        malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai.<br />        (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai)</p>
<p>Manimekalai it <br />    is<br />        very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was <br />earlier <br />    than<br />        the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>        The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in <br />Tamil <br />    Nadu.</p>
<p>        Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in <br />Tamil<br />        composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of <br />eleventh<br />        century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as <br />follows:</p>
<p>        ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori <br />porul <br />    ithu<br />        entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi <br />    paadiya<br />        Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....."</p>
<p>        Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>        meaning :</p>
<p>        ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking <br />of <br />    the<br />        Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics <br />and<br />        explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets <br />"developing<br />        poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />        appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of <br />    praise)<br />        and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai).</p>
<p>Thamil<br />        Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />        government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was <br />born <br />    50<br />        years before Christ,</p>
<p>        Virarajendra</p>

        <p>On Thirukural Dating,<br />Internal evidence which suggest later age of Thirukkural according to <br />Dr.Zvelebil in his most famous book ' Smile of Murugan'.</p>
<p>" A number of important grammatical innovations occur in the language <br />of this text when compared with early old Tamil of classical period: <br />the plural suffis -kal is used with bouth nouns of higher and lower <br />class(cf.263 marraiyavarkal,9191 puriyarkal); the conditional suffix -<br />el occurs frequently (368 untel,655 ceyvanel , 566 inrel etc.) <br />negative forms in -amal belong to invotations too (101,103 ceyyamal, <br />1024 culamal) there are more of such features which show that , <br />Thirukkural cannot be contemporaneous with (or older than) the <br />"Cankam" poems but later."</p>
<p>"There is definitely a hiher percentage of sanskrit loan words in <br />Thirukkural than in Tolkappiyam and in the "Cankam" works. A compelete <br />list is given in S.Vaiyapuri pillai's Tamilccutarmanikal pp 72-73."</p>
<p>Zvelebil goes on to list all these words and differs with Vayapuri's <br />number of 137 words and rather suggest around 100 words. Which is <br />still higher compared to Sangam age.</p>
<p>"A few of the metaphors in the text seem to be loan translations from <br />Sanskrit, e.g.piravip perun katal " the ocean of rebirths": Sanskrit <br />Samsarasagara - Just as there is a not negligible influence of <br />sanskrit vocabulary on Thiruvalluvar's lexis, the author of the Kural <br />is undoubtedly to some extent indebted to Sanskritic sources like <br />Manavadharamasastra, Kautily's work etc. Thus Thirukural 43 is almost <br />a Translation of Manav. iii . 72, Thirukkural 54 is vauge echo of <br />Manav. ix.12. Thiruk. 58 od Manav. v.155, Thiruk. 396 about learning <br />has a parallel in Manav. ii. 212. Thiruk. 501 (the method of testing <br />candidates for ministerial office) is based undoubtedly on Kautilya <br />I.10 (upadha-"the moral test"), Thiruk. 385 mentions the same four <br />kinds of acts of a kind as those started in Manav. vii.99,100 and <br />Kamandaka I.20 etc. How ever ,this is, in itself, of great <br />importance,it would be foolish to deny Thiruvalluvar, a mind so <br />universal,cultured,learned and eclectic, knew these basic Sanskritic <br />sources on dharma and niti . He was without doubt a part of one great <br />Indian ethical,didactic tradition. It is more important that he was <br />also integral part of the non-Sanskritic and pre-Sanskritic Tamil <br />Tradition; this fact is seen not only from his conception of <br />"pleasure" which so typically a reflection of the akam genre, but also <br />from the all prevading pragmatic, this -wordly, emperical and ,to <br />agreat extent, humanisitic and universalistic character of his <br />particular conception of Dharma and Niti."</p>
<p>Smile of Murugan page 169-171.</p>
<p>There are more details on Dating of Thirukkural in his "Tamil <br />Literature" and "Companion study to History of Tamil Literature" <br />books. Tired of Typing now will post the details in that book soon.</p>
<p>Further reading on Language of Thirukkural <br />" FOr compelete Linguistic analysis of the text cf. <br />J.J.Glazov,Morphemic Analysis of the language of Thirukkural, in  <br />Introduction to Historical Grammar of Tamil Language, Moscow,1967,113-<br />176."</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Vairam,</p>
<p>  One question, the spread of Jain is around 4 CE - agreed. How does<br />  this related to Thirkural? I have heard it has traces of Jainism in<br />  it, Thirukural itself need not to be written when Jainism spread in<br />  TN. Jainism orginated in India around 6BCE, it could have spread in <br />TN<br />  in 4th CE, but people might have started following it much earlier<br />  than that right? So, only the spread of Jainism is the basis to put<br />  Thirukural as 4CE?</p>

<p>    "As regards teaching of history, it is pathetic. If you read <br />Zvelebil,<br />    he will date Tiruvalluvar to ca. 4th century AD. I consider that <br />to be<br />    right. Tirukkural shows the spread of Jain principles as the ideal<br />    throughout the society even though they might not have been <br />followed<br />    in practice. Also, the attitude towards meateating in TK is very<br />    different from that found in Purananuru, etc. But Tamil <br />enthusiasts<br />    push back the date of Tiruvalluvar. In 2005, I was one of the <br />editors<br />    of the souvenir for the FETNA convention. A person/friend who <br />wrote an<br />    article refused to change the date of Tiruvalluvar. So we had to <br />add a<br />    disclaimer in the front stating that the contents of the articles<br />    reflect the opinions of authors and not the opinions of the <br />editors."</p>

<p>         Date: 17-2-2009</p>
<p>         Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>         You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>         "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be <br />born<br />    50</p>
<p>         years before Christ, but the language and the internal <br />evidence<br />     point<br />         Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...."</p>
<p>         I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence <br />that<br />     you<br />         have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of<br />     Thiruvalluver<br />         was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>         Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango<br />    Adikal<br />     and<br />         Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram <br />and<br />         Manimekalai.</p>
<p>         Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during <br />the<br />     same<br />         period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city <br />of<br />     the<br />         Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of<br />    Kerala.</p>
<p>         Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool<br />    Ilankai<br />         Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony <br />of<br />     the<br />         newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji <br />Nagar.</p>
<p>         The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka <br />who<br />     has<br />         been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>         Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai <br />with<br />         stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan <br />and<br />         Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan <br />by<br />         Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the<br />     Kovalan<br />         Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>         Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of <br />the<br />         Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems.</p>
<p>         We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made <br />use<br />    of<br />         Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>         (1) "?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam<br />     tholuthahaimai<br />         thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki<br />    vinnaka<br />         maatharkku virunthu?."<br />         (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>         (2) "?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor<br />     sollum<br />         paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />         kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />         (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>         In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as<br />    follows.</p>
<p>         (1) "??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap <br />peiyum<br />     peru<br />         malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai.<br />         (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai)</p>
<p>Manimekalai<br />    it<br />     is<br />         very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was <br />earlier<br />     than<br />         the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>         The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in<br />    Tamil<br />     Nadu.</p>
<p>         Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in<br />    Tamil<br />         composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of <br />eleventh<br />         century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as<br />    follows:</p>
<p>         ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori <br />porul<br />     ithu<br />         entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi<br />     paadiya<br />         Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....."</p>
<p>         Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>         meaning :</p>
<p>         ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking <br />of<br />     the<br />         Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics <br />and<br />         explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets<br />    "developing<br />         poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God <br />Siva)<br />         appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of<br />     praise)<br />         and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai).</p>
<p>Thamil<br />         Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />         government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was <br />born<br />     50<br />         years before Christ,</p>

<p>            what iam trying to say is that saivism was prevalent in<br />    sangam<br />          period.<br />            but it was not included in the 18 mel kanakku. this was <br />due<br />    to<br />     the<br />            influence of jains.</p>
<p>          Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The question <br />is<br />     use of<br />          language and other pointers. Every literature has internal<br />     evidence.</p>
<p>          Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50<br />    years<br />          before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence <br />point<br />          Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. Kalithokai <br />and<br />          Paripatal have been found of later classical age because of <br />the<br />          language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with<br />          Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a very <br />late<br />     work?<br />          (around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>          There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are <br />different<br />          Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also evidence of <br />two<br />          Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based on works <br />of<br />          Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide reference on <br />any<br />          question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>          In a similar way it would be helpful for all other members <br />if<br />    you<br />     can<br />          give the reference book based on which you have come to your<br />          conclusion. After all this a discussion board , so this <br />would<br />    be<br />     great<br />          on your side if you can enlighten us with the books which <br />have<br />     shaped<br />          your ideas.</p>

<p>Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>You say that since Thirukkural is embedded with a lot of Jain principles, this is a 4th century work and so you feel this as the correct dating. A wild question??? Why could not have the Jains copied the meateating (I mean no meateating) principles. How sure are you that it was the so called Hindus who copied from the Jains? Just curious.</p>

<p>Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>You say that since Thirukkural is embedded with a lot of Jain principles, this is a 4th century work and so you feel this as the correct dating. A wild question??? Why could not have the Jains copied the meateating (I mean no meateating) principles. How sure are you that it was the so called Hindus who copied from the Jains? Just curious.</p>

<p>      Date: 17-2-2009</p>
<p>      Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>      You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>      "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50</p>
<p>      years before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence <br />  point<br />      Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...."</p>
<p>      I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence that <br />  you<br />      have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />  Thiruvalluver<br />      was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>      Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango Adikal <br />  and<br />      Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram and<br />      Manimekalai.</p>
<p>      Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during the <br />  same<br />      period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city of <br />  the<br />      Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of Kerala.</p>
<p>      Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool Ilankai<br />      Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony of <br />  the<br />      newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji Nagar.</p>
<p>      The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka who <br />  has<br />      been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>      Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai with<br />      stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan and<br />      Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan by<br />      Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the <br />  Kovalan<br />      Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>      Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of the<br />      Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems.</p>
<p>      We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made use of<br />      Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>      (1) "?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />  tholuthahaimai<br />      thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki vinnaka<br />      maatharkku virunthu?."<br />      (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      (2) "?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor <br />  sollum<br />      paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />      kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />      (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as follows.</p>
<p>      (1) "??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap peiyum <br />  peru<br />      malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai.<br />      (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai)</p>
<p>  is<br />      very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was earlier <br />  than<br />      the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>      The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in Tamil <br />  Nadu.</p>
<p>      Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in Tamil<br />      composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of eleventh<br />      century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as follows:</p>
<p>      ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori porul <br />  ithu<br />      entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi <br />  paadiya<br />      Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....."</p>
<p>      Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>      meaning :</p>
<p>      ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking of <br />  the<br />      Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics and<br />      explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets "developing<br />      poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />      appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of <br />  praise)<br />      and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai).</p>
<p>      Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />      government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was born <br />  50<br />      years before Christ,</p>
<p>      Virarajendra</p>

<p>         what iam trying to say is that saivism was prevalent in sangam<br />       period.<br />         but it was not included in the 18 mel kanakku. this was due to <br />  the<br />         influence of jains.</p>
<p>       Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The question is <br />  use of<br />       language and other pointers. Every literature has internal <br />  evidence.</p>
<p>       Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50 years<br />       before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence point<br />       Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. Kalithokai and<br />       Paripatal have been found of later classical age because of the<br />       language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with<br />       Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a very late <br />  work?<br />       (around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>       There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are different<br />       Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also evidence of two<br />       Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based on works of<br />       Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide reference on any<br />       question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>       In a similar way it would be helpful for all other members if you <br />  can<br />       give the reference book based on which you have come to your<br />       conclusion. After all this a discussion board , so this would be <br />  great<br />       on your side if you can enlighten us with the books which have <br />  shaped<br />       your ideas.</p>

<p>         saivism during sangam period is -for obvious political reasons<br />         prevailing now in tamilnadu -being sidelined or not projected <br />  at<br />       all.</p>
<p>         11 th thirumurai is a telling example of saivism in sangam age.</p>

<p>      years before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence <br />  point<br />      Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...."</p>
<p>      I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence that <br />  you<br />      have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />  Thiruvalluver<br />      was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>      Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango Adikal <br />  and<br />      Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram and<br />      Manimekalai.</p>
<p>      Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during the <br />  same<br />      period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city of <br />  the<br />      Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of Kerala.</p>
<p>      Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool Ilankai<br />      Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony of <br />  the<br />      newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji Nagar.</p>
<p>      The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka who <br />  has<br />      been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>      Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai with<br />      stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan and<br />      Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan by<br />      Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the <br />  Kovalan<br />      Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>      Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of the<br />      Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems.</p>
<p>      We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made use of<br />      Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>      (1) "?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />  tholuthahaimai<br />      thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki vinnaka<br />      maatharkku virunthu?."<br />      (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      (2) "?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor <br />  sollum<br />      paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />      kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />      (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as follows.</p>
<p>      (1) "??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap peiyum <br />  peru<br />      malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai.<br />      (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai)</p>
<p>  is<br />      very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was earlier <br />  than<br />      the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>      The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in Tamil <br />  Nadu.</p>
<p>      Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in Tamil<br />      composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of eleventh<br />      century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as follows:</p>
<p>      ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori porul <br />  ithu<br />      entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi <br />  paadiya<br />      Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....."</p>
<p>      Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>      meaning :</p>
<p>      ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking of <br />  the<br />      Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics and<br />      explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets "developing<br />      poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />      appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of <br />  praise)<br />      and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai).</p>
<p>      Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />      government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was born <br />  50<br />      years before Christ,</p>

        <p>Hi Vairam,</p>
<p>One question, the spread of Jain is around 4 CE - agreed. How does<br />this related to Thirkural? I have heard it has traces of Jainism in<br />it, Thirukural itself need not to be written when Jainism spread in<br />TN. Jainism orginated in India around 6BCE, it could have spread in TN<br />in 4th CE, but people might have started following it much earlier<br />than that right? So, only the spread of Jainism is the basis to put<br />Thirukural as 4CE?</p>

<p>  "As regards teaching of history, it is pathetic. If you read Zvelebil,<br />  he will date Tiruvalluvar to ca. 4th century AD. I consider that to be<br />  right. Tirukkural shows the spread of Jain principles as the ideal<br />  throughout the society even though they might not have been followed<br />  in practice. Also, the attitude towards meateating in TK is very<br />  different from that found in Purananuru, etc. But Tamil enthusiasts<br />  push back the date of Tiruvalluvar. In 2005, I was one of the editors<br />  of the souvenir for the FETNA convention. A person/friend who wrote an<br />  article refused to change the date of Tiruvalluvar. So we had to add a<br />  disclaimer in the front stating that the contents of the articles<br />  reflect the opinions of authors and not the opinions of the editors."</p>

<p>       Date: 17-2-2009</p>
<p>       Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>       You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>       "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born<br />  50</p>
<p>       years before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence<br />   point<br />       Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...."</p>
<p>       I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence that<br />   you<br />       have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of<br />   Thiruvalluver<br />       was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>       Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango<br />  Adikal<br />   and<br />       Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram and<br />       Manimekalai.</p>
<p>       Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during the<br />   same<br />       period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city of<br />   the<br />       Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of<br />  Kerala.</p>
<p>       Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool<br />  Ilankai<br />       Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony of<br />   the<br />       newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji Nagar.</p>
<p>       The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka who<br />   has<br />       been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>       Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai with<br />       stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan and<br />       Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan by<br />       Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the<br />   Kovalan<br />       Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>       Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of the<br />       Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems.</p>
<p>       We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made use<br />  of<br />       Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>       (1) "?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam<br />   tholuthahaimai<br />       thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki<br />  vinnaka<br />       maatharkku virunthu?."<br />       (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>       (2) "?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor<br />   sollum<br />       paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />       kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />       (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>       In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as<br />  follows.</p>
<p>       (1) "??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap peiyum<br />   peru<br />       malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai.<br />       (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai)</p>
<p>  it<br />   is<br />       very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was earlier<br />   than<br />       the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>       The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in<br />  Tamil<br />   Nadu.</p>
<p>       Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in<br />  Tamil<br />       composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of eleventh<br />       century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as<br />  follows:</p>
<p>       ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori porul<br />   ithu<br />       entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi<br />   paadiya<br />       Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....."</p>
<p>       Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>       meaning :</p>
<p>       ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking of<br />   the<br />       Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics and<br />       explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets<br />  "developing<br />       poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />       appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of<br />   praise)<br />       and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai).</p>
<p>       Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />       government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was born<br />   50<br />       years before Christ,</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>I read your article regarding the dating of Silappathikaaram, in which<br />many of your statements are in agreement with me, which finally boils<br />down to the fact that you are inline with what I have mentioned about<br />the two epics as belonging to the period between A.D.171-193. </p>
<p>To any one who have studied the Silappathikarem &amp; Manimekalai it is<br />very clear that their authors (poets)Ilango Adihal - younger brother<br />of Cheran Senguttuvan and Sattanaar lived during the period of this<br />episode. Hence the date of these two epics too falls within this period.</p>
<p>Regarding Thirukkural being earlier than A.D.171 I have pointed out<br />"positive references" in these two Epics itself, to prove my point<br />that Thirukkural is earlier than A.D.171. </p>
<p>Hence I very kindly request you to re-study same and provide "your own<br />independent views" - without relying on other Scholar's views to<br />support you, which may be correct or "may not be correct" in the<br />opinion of many others.</p>
<p>Also did you read my reference to Thirukkural in Kalladam ???<br />What it is your views on same. Also remember 5th century was the dawn<br />of Pallava period. The third Sangam period ended with the Kalabhra<br />invasion around A.D.350(4th century), and Jainism gained a "strong<br />position" in Tamil Nadu, which prevailed in a lesser way during the<br />Sangam period </p>
<p>Regarding Scholars using linguistic variation in the ancient literary<br />works - to date them, I have "my own views" which are as follows:</p>
<p>"....The poets of the Sangam Tamil Acadamy composed literary works to<br />the grammetical norms set in the Agastiyam, Tholkaappiam and other<br />ancient grammetical works, and the Tamil Sangam too was set up with<br />many scholarly poets in Tamil, with the sole intention of devoloping<br />Tamil and producing high standard Tamil literary works of esteem.</p>
<p>Do you think either during Sangam period or post-Sangam period, any<br />other countrymen outside the fold of Sangam Tamil Academy, would have<br />spoken, written, or composed Literary works in Tamil to the same norms<br />set up by Agastiyam &amp; Tholkaappiam linguistically, in high class Tamil.</p>
<p>Hence could we say a literary or religious work composed by them<br />during either of these two periods doesnot fall to that period, simply<br />because they are not in align to Sangam Literary works liguistically,<br />even though many other evidences "point" to such literary or religious<br />work - to be of the above mentioned periods.</p>
<p>Even in a Tamil University of today, a student doing a specialised<br />degee course in Tamil Lanuage will get accustomed to writing or<br />composing Literary work of scholarly Tamil than the others who didnot<br />have any such specialised study, but the average knowledge of Tamil in<br />their schools and colleges.</p>
<p>Kavignar Vairamutthu and any average laymen of today, composing a poem<br />each, could both be of the same linguistic scholarship. Could people<br />many centuries later point to the poem composed by the average layman<br />and say he doesnot belong the period of Kavignar Vairamutthu being<br />year 2009.</p>
<p>Today we hear of Chennai Tamil, Thirutchi Tamil, Thirunelveli Tamil,<br />Mathurai Tamil, Koyaamuththoor Tamil, which are not only<br />linguistically slight different - as spoken and written Tamil, but<br />even some words used too are different. Can the people centuries later<br />taking the composition of the Thirutchi Tamils as yardstick and say<br />the composition of the people of the other regions of today's<br />TamilNadu, doesnot belong to year 2009.</p>
<p>Hence trying to estimate the period of a Literary or Religious<br />compositions "purly" on the linguistic basis or etymological basis by<br />Scholars cannot always be taken as the positive guidance in estimating<br />the period of a work. It could be a "rough guidance" in the absense of<br />any other evidences, but not in the face of many other evidences which<br />are already available.</p>
<p>Please provide your views in connection with same</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>      Date: 17-2-2009</p>
<p>      Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>      You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>      "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50</p>
<p>      years before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence <br />  point<br />      Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...."</p>
<p>      I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence that <br />  you<br />      have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />  Thiruvalluver<br />      was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>      Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango Adikal <br />  and<br />      Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram and<br />      Manimekalai.</p>
<p>      Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during the <br />  same<br />      period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city of <br />  the<br />      Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of Kerala.</p>
<p>      Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool Ilankai<br />      Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony of <br />  the<br />      newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji Nagar.</p>
<p>      The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka who <br />  has<br />      been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>      Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai with<br />      stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan and<br />      Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan by<br />      Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the <br />  Kovalan<br />      Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>      Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of the<br />      Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems.</p>
<p>      We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made use of<br />      Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>      (1) "?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />  tholuthahaimai<br />      thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki vinnaka<br />      maatharkku virunthu?."<br />      (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      (2) "?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor <br />  sollum<br />      paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />      kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />      (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as follows.</p>
<p>      (1) "??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap peiyum <br />  peru<br />      malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai.<br />      (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai)</p>
<p>  is<br />      very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was earlier <br />  than<br />      the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>      The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in Tamil <br />  Nadu.</p>
<p>      Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in Tamil<br />      composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of eleventh<br />      century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as follows:</p>
<p>      ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori porul <br />  ithu<br />      entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi <br />  paadiya<br />      Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....."</p>
<p>      Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>      meaning :</p>
<p>      ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking of <br />  the<br />      Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics and<br />      explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets "developing<br />      poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />      appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of <br />  praise)<br />      and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai).</p>
<p>      Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />      government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was born <br />  50<br />      years before Christ,</p>
<p>      Virarajendra</p>

<p>         what iam trying to say is that saivism was prevalent in sangam<br />       period.<br />         but it was not included in the 18 mel kanakku. this was due to <br />  the<br />         influence of jains.</p>
<p>       Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The question is <br />  use of<br />       language and other pointers. Every literature has internal <br />  evidence.</p>
<p>       Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50 years<br />       before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence point<br />       Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. Kalithokai and<br />       Paripatal have been found of later classical age because of the<br />       language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with<br />       Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a very late <br />  work?<br />       (around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>       There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are different<br />       Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also evidence of two<br />       Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based on works of<br />       Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide reference on any<br />       question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>       In a similar way it would be helpful for all other members if you <br />  can<br />       give the reference book based on which you have come to your<br />       conclusion. After all this a discussion board , so this would be <br />  great<br />       on your side if you can enlighten us with the books which have <br />  shaped<br />       your ideas.</p>

<p>         saivism during sangam period is -for obvious political reasons<br />         prevailing now in tamilnadu -being sidelined or not projected <br />  at<br />       all.</p>
<p>         11 th thirumurai is a telling example of saivism in sangam age.</p>

        <p>Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>You say that since Thirukkural is embedded with a lot of Jain principles, this is a 4th century work and so you feel this as the correct dating. A wild question??? Why could not have the Jains copied the meateating (I mean no meateating) principles. How sure are you that it was the so called Hindus who copied from the Jains? Just curious.</p>

        <p>And for Thirukural Dating there are various papers available and this <br />is part of my personal communication with Dr. S. Palaniappan Ph.D.<br />President<br />South Asia Research and Information Institute</p>
<p>"As regards teaching of history, it is pathetic. If you read Zvelebil, <br />he will date Tiruvalluvar to ca. 4th century AD. I consider that to be <br />right. Tirukkural shows the spread of Jain principles as the ideal <br />throughout the society even though they might not have been followed <br />in practice. Also, the attitude towards meateating in TK is very <br />different from that found in Purananuru, etc. But Tamil enthusiasts <br />push back the date of Tiruvalluvar. In 2005, I was one of the editors <br />of the souvenir for the FETNA convention. A person/friend who wrote an <br />article refused to change the date of Tiruvalluvar. So we had to add a <br />disclaimer in the front stating that the contents of the articles <br />reflect the opinions of authors and not the opinions of the editors."</p>

<p>      Date: 17-2-2009</p>
<p>      Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>      You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>      "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born <br />50</p>
<p>      years before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence <br />  point<br />      Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...."</p>
<p>      I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence that <br />  you<br />      have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of <br />  Thiruvalluver<br />      was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>      Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango <br />Adikal <br />  and<br />      Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram and<br />      Manimekalai.</p>
<p>      Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during the <br />  same<br />      period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city of <br />  the<br />      Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of <br />Kerala.</p>
<p>      Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool <br />Ilankai<br />      Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony of <br />  the<br />      newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji Nagar.</p>
<p>      The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka who <br />  has<br />      been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>      Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai with<br />      stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan and<br />      Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan by<br />      Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the <br />  Kovalan<br />      Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>      Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of the<br />      Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems.</p>
<p>      We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made use <br />of<br />      Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>      (1) "?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam <br />  tholuthahaimai<br />      thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki <br />vinnaka<br />      maatharkku virunthu?."<br />      (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      (2) "?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor <br />  sollum<br />      paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />      kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />      (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>      In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as <br />follows.</p>
<p>      (1) "??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap peiyum <br />  peru<br />      malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai.<br />      (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai)</p>
<p>it <br />  is<br />      very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was earlier <br />  than<br />      the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>      The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in <br />Tamil <br />  Nadu.</p>
<p>      Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in <br />Tamil<br />      composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of eleventh<br />      century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as <br />follows:</p>
<p>      ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori porul <br />  ithu<br />      entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi <br />  paadiya<br />      Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....."</p>
<p>      Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>      meaning :</p>
<p>      ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking of <br />  the<br />      Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics and<br />      explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets <br />"developing<br />      poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />      appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of <br />  praise)<br />      and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai).</p>
<p>      Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />      government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was born <br />  50<br />      years before Christ,</p>

        <p>wow. Viraranjendra sir beautiful post. What is the period of 1 and 2nd<br />sangam period?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />siva.</p>

<p>  Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>  You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>
<p>  "......Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50</p>
<p>  years before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence point<br />  Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century...."</p>
<p>  I am very much interested in knowing the internal evidence that you<br />  have detected in Thirukkural, which proves the work of Thiruvalluver<br />  was of the period 4-5 th century.</p>
<p>  Two couplets of Thirukkkural have been used by Poets Ilango Adikal and<br />  Saththanaar in their epic poems, namely the Silappathikaaram and<br />  Manimekalai.</p>
<p>  Sillapathikaarem and Manimekalai - both were composed during the same<br />  period by these two poets from Vanji Nagar, the capital city of the<br />  Chera king Cheran Senguttuvan - the present Kodungallur of Kerala.</p>
<p>  Silappathikarem specifically mentions that "....kadal sool Ilankai<br />  Kayavaahu venthan..." was there at the consecration ceremony of the<br />  newly built Kannahi Temple by Cheran Senguttuvan at Vanji Nagar.</p>
<p>  The Kayavahu Venthan was the king Gajabahu - 1 of Sri Lanka who has<br />  been positively dated as ruling during the years A.D.171-193</p>
<p>  Hence it is clear that the Silappathikarem and Manimekalai with<br />  stories inter-related to each other, one speaking of Kovalan and<br />  Kannaki and the other of Manimekalai the daughter of Kovalan by<br />  Mathavi belongs to the period of A.D.171-193, the period the Kovalan<br />  Kannaki episode took place.</p>
<p>  Now what is interesting is both these poets have made use of the<br />  Thiruvalluvar's couplets in their epic poems.</p>
<p>  We shall first see the work Silappathikaarem which has made use of<br />  Thirukkural at two places.</p>
<p>  (1) "?.Theivam tholaa al kolunat troluvaalai theivam tholuthahaimai<br />  thinnithaal theivamaai mannaha maatharku aniyaaya Kannaki vinnaka<br />  maatharkku virunthu?."<br />  (refer Katturai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>  (2) "?..Allavai seithaarkku aram kootramaam ennum pallavaiyor sollum<br />  paluthantre - pollaa vaduvinaiye seitha vaya venthan thevi<br />  kadivinaiyen seivathoo ung kaan?.."<br />  (refer Valakkurai kaathai of Silappathikaaram)</p>
<p>  In Manimekalai we find the Thirukkural made use of is as follows.</p>
<p>  (1) "??Theivam tholaa al kolunat trolutheluvaal peiyennap peiyum peru<br />  malai?.." yentravap poiyyil pulavan porulurai therai.<br />  (refer Sirai sei kaathai of Manimekalai)</p>
<p>  very clear the period of composition of Thirukkural was earlier than<br />  the period A.D.171, and not of the 4th or 5th century.</p>
<p>  The 4th or 5th century was the dawn of the Pallava perion in Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>  Further a reference in "Kallaadam" a Saiva religious work in Tamil<br />  composed by poet Kallaadanaar - dated to the period of eleventh<br />  century TamilNadu - have mentioned about Thiruvalluvar as follows:</p>
<p>  ".....Samaya Kanakkar mathi vali kooraathu Ulakiyal koori porul ithu<br />  entra Valluvan thannakku, valar kavi Pulavar mun muthatkavi paadiya<br />  Mukkan Perumaan Maathudan thontri Koodalul nirainthon....."</p>
<p>  Kallaadam by Kallaadanaar, verse ? 14</p>
<p>  meaning :</p>
<p>  ".....The Valluvan 'without' stating in the line of thinking of the<br />  Religious Saints, preached (the) Universal (Code of) Ethics and<br />  explained what (they) meant - to him amidst the poets "developing<br />  poetic tradition"(Thamil Sangam) the Mukkan Perumaan(God Siva)<br />  appeared with Maathu(Shakthi) and composed the first poem (of praise)<br />  and brightened the Koodal(Mathurai).</p>
<p>  Sangam period, which falls in line with the "......Tamil Nadu<br />  government declaration that the Sage/Poet Thiruvalluvar was born 50<br />  years before Christ,</p>

<p>   Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The question is use of<br />   language and other pointers. Every literature has internal evidence.</p>
<p>   Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50 years<br />   before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence point<br />   Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. Kalithokai and<br />   Paripatal have been found of later classical age because of the<br />   language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with<br />   Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a very late work?<br />   (around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>   There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are different<br />   Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also evidence of two<br />   Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based on works of<br />   Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide reference on any<br />   question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>   In a similar way it would be helpful for all other members if you can<br />   give the reference book based on which you have come to your<br />   conclusion. After all this a discussion board , so this would be great<br />   on your side if you can enlighten us with the books which have shaped<br />   your ideas.</p>

<p>Dear Thiru Vairam,</p>
<p>You have mentioned in your post as follows:</p>

<p>Keep aside the anthologies and other influence. The question is use of <br />language and other pointers. Every literature has internal evidence.</p>
<p>Tamil Nadu government declares Thiruvalluvar to be born 50 years <br />before Christ, but the language and the internal evidence point <br />Thirukural to be written around 4-5 th century. Kalithokai and <br />Paripatal have been found of later classical age because of the <br />language usage and internal evidence. Same thing with <br />Thirumurgatrupadai of Nakeerer. It was found to be a very late work?<br />(around 7-8th century AD).</p>
<p>There are clear cut evidence to prove that there are different <br />Auvaiyar, Nakkirar and Agathiyar. There is also evidence of two <br />Kapilars,Patinathar. This is my understanding based on works of <br />Dr.Kamil Zvelebil. I would be happy to provide reference on any <br />question you have on my notes.</p>
<p>In a similar way it would be helpful for all other members if you can <br />give the reference book based on which you have come to your <br />conclusion. After all this a discussion board , so this would be great <br />on your side if you can enlighten us with the books which have shaped <br />your ideas.</p>

<blockquote><p>  freinds,<br />  what iam trying to say is that saivism was prevalent in sangam <br />period. <br />  but it was not included in the 18 mel kanakku. this was due to the <br />  influence of jains.<br />  but they were classified into 11th thirumurai later in 12th century <br />  into the saiva canons. this is very much interesting. the works of <br />  kabilar,baranar and nakkeerar were excluded from sangam literature <br />on <br />  religious bias.</p>
<p>  saivism during sangam period is -for obvious political reasons <br />  prevailing now in tamilnadu -being sidelined or not projected at <br />all.</p>
<p>  11 th thirumurai is a telling example of saivism in sangam age.</p>
