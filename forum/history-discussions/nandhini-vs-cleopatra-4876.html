<p>below is written about cleopatra ...</p>
<p>For her actual beauty, it is said, was not in itself so remarkable <br />that none could be compared with her, or that no one could see her <br />without being struck by it, but the contact of her presence, if you <br />lived with her, was irresistible; the attraction of her person, <br />joining with the charm of her conversation, and the character that <br />attended all she said or did, was something bewitching. It was a <br />pleasure merely to hear the sound of her voice, with which, like an <br />instrument of many strings, she could pass from one language to <br />another; so that there were few of the barbarian nations that she <br />answered by an interpreter.</p>

        <p>accept yours. but the pandyas did outlive the cholas..</p>
<p>while on the subject</p>
<p>Pandalam in Kerala is the chosen and blessed place where Lord <br />Ayyappa, the presiding deity of Sabarimala had had His human sojourn <br />as the son of the Raja of Pandalam. The Pandalam kingdom was <br />established around 79 ME (903 AD) by the Pandalam royal family who <br />are the descendents of the Pandya kings of Madurai. The Pandya royal <br />family had to flee Madurai because of threats to their lives posed <br />by their own ministers. A branch of the fleeing family moved <br />westward, briefly staying at various places it acquired by purchase. <br />The family kept on the move for over a century, finally reaching <br />Pandalam in 79 ME. This was chosen to be the permanent home for the <br />royal family. The then ruler of Venad (later Travancore) helped to <br />establish the kingdom at Pandalam. According to the Travancore State <br />Manual, the Rajas of Pandalam " were always friendly to the Kings of <br />Travancore</p>

<p>      To all those who support nandini and are aganist vasanthasena,</p>
<p>      I read all the mails and noted the contents. But you should <br />also <br />    appriciate<br />      the point that Manohara is a Movie 180 minutes where as <br />ponniyin <br />    Selvan is a<br />      novel spanning 5 Volumes</p>
<p>      I am sure many of you in this group might have read The Da <br />Vinci <br />    Code and<br />      some might have seen the movie as well, apart from reading the <br />    book. Well, I<br />      belong to the second category. When we saw the movie at home. <br />    Every 10th or<br />      15th minute I had to pause the movie give them the background <br />of <br />    the scene<br />      so that my family members could also appriciate, what was <br />written <br />    in that<br />      book and how the same has been condensed into a movie.</p>
<p>      The point I am trying to drive here is Had Ponniyin Selvan <br />been <br />    made into a<br />      film, we might not know how the Nandhini charecter would have <br />    shaped out<br />      finally. On the contrary only our CM will know how Vasantha <br />  Sena's <br />    charecter<br />      would have shaped had Manohara been written as a Novel.</p>
<p>      Well, Athai-kku Meesai mulacha Chitappa! (Athaikku Meesai <br />    Molachathaane<br />      Chitappa, neither was PS taken into a movie nor manohara into <br />a <br />    novel.) I<br />      will salute the democracy and will accept the verdict of the <br />    majority.</p>

<p>    To all those who support nandini and are aganist vasanthasena,</p>
<p>    I read all the mails and noted the contents. But you should also <br />  appriciate<br />    the point that Manohara is a Movie 180 minutes where as ponniyin <br />  Selvan is a<br />    novel spanning 5 Volumes</p>
<p>    I am sure many of you in this group might have read The Da Vinci <br />  Code and<br />    some might have seen the movie as well, apart from reading the <br />  book. Well, I<br />    belong to the second category. When we saw the movie at home. <br />  Every 10th or<br />    15th minute I had to pause the movie give them the background of <br />  the scene<br />    so that my family members could also appriciate, what was written <br />  in that<br />    book and how the same has been condensed into a movie.</p>
<p>    The point I am trying to drive here is Had Ponniyin Selvan been <br />  made into a<br />    film, we might not know how the Nandhini charecter would have <br />  shaped out<br />    finally. On the contrary only our CM will know how Vasantha <br />Sena's <br />  charecter<br />    would have shaped had Manohara been written as a Novel.</p>
<p>    Well, Athai-kku Meesai mulacha Chitappa! (Athaikku Meesai <br />  Molachathaane<br />    Chitappa, neither was PS taken into a movie nor manohara into a <br />  novel.) I<br />    will salute the democracy and will accept the verdict of the <br />  majority.</p>

          nandhini Vs cleopatra        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>To all those who support nandini and are aganist vasanthasena,</p>
<p>I read all the mails and noted the contents. But you should also appriciate<br />the point that Manohara is a Movie 180 minutes where as ponniyin Selvan is a<br />novel spanning 5 Volumes</p>
<p>I am sure many of you in this group might have read The Da Vinci Code and<br />some might have seen the movie as well, apart from reading the book. Well, I<br />belong to the second category. When we saw the movie at home. Every 10th or<br />15th minute I had to pause the movie give them the background of the scene<br />so that my family members could also appriciate, what was written in that<br />book and how the same has been condensed into a movie.</p>
<p>The point I am trying to drive here is Had Ponniyin Selvan been made into a<br />film, we might not know how the Nandhini charecter would have shaped out<br />finally. On the contrary only our CM will know how Vasantha Sena's charecter<br />would have shaped had Manohara been written as a Novel.</p>
<p>Well, Athai-kku Meesai mulacha Chitappa! (Athaikku Meesai Molachathaane<br />Chitappa, neither was <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  taken into a movie nor manohara into a novel.) I<br />will salute the democracy and will accept the verdict of the majority.</acronym></p>
<p>luv,</p>

<p>This statue was installed some time in 70's in remembrance of <br />abolition of Horse Racing in Chennai. There were reports that statue <br />of the man is made with the features of Vandhiya Thevan of Kalki's <br />Ponniyin Selvan. Two identical statues are installed on both sides <br />of Anna Flyover</p>

<p>you are right about kundavai ( who hated her from first sight - <br />maybe she felt jealous of her beauty over hers!!! we can have a <br />discussion on that as well, but i think in terms of sheer physcial <br />beauty ( animal attraction) nandhini wins hands down.</p>
<p>anirudhar, chinna pazhuvetayar.. yes but Tirumalai always had a <br />soft corner for his adopted sister - infact he was cross with periya <br />pazhuvetayar for having married her - for he wanted to devot her <br />into service of god...</p>
<p>as regards the people who fell for her - periya pazhuvetayar/ <br />kandamaaran and parthibendra pallavan .... but you cant say that <br />about VT - VT flirted with almost all the women characters in PS - <br />starting with manimegalai, nandhini, kundavai and even poonguzhali, <br />but fell only for kundavai.</p>
<p>but i think there is one diff between vasanta sena and nandhini - in <br />terms of their objective - vasanta sena's was sheer power whereas <br />kalki gives a patriotic color to nandhini's quest at the same time - <br />he never degrades her character/morality - that is the genius of <br />kalki - his master stroke - the villain characters are not the dumb <br />stupid ones portrayed in todays movies - but steady, strond willed, <br />deep charactered gems - be it naaganandhi in SS and <br />nandhini/ravidasan in PS </p>

        <p>Vasantha sena was a classic, T.R.Rajakumari's voice modulation and her presentation was the closest you can get to imagining Nandini. </p>
<p>As for Dr.KK's closeness to the epic, you can check out the horse rider near anna flyover, the looks fall in place to our hero of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ( the General of Chola army....<br />He was installed during the then regime.</acronym></p>

        <p>Again I beg to differ ... Nandini's words neither Kundavi nor Anirudhar or<br />Tirumalai or for that matter anyone from the chola family liked her /<br />believed in her sweet words. if I am not mistekn not even chinna<br />Pazhuvetarayar had high regards for his sister in law. It was Peria<br />Pazhuvetarayar / Vallavarayan Vandhiya Thevan / Pallava kumaran who believed<br />in him. Adavadhu mohathil mayangiyavargall. Whats the difference between her<br />and Vasanthasena ... Who seduced kesarivarman / Manohara's father /<br />Uggirasenan? Love is blind so people ...</p>

<p>    I am not sure what generated Nandini but there was a character very<br />    similar to her in the movie Manohara released in 1954. Vasantha Sena was in<br />    all modes same as Nandhini.<br />    Those who have seen Manohara would know this person, also equally<br />    intriguing is the fact that Nandini being a fictional frame and Vasantha<br />    Sena being a fictional person too, both stories are based out of chola<br />    dynasty!</p>

<p>while on the same subject - the robe 1953 and its sequel demetrius <br />and teh galdiators 1954 ( 20th C fox) has a few scenes which are <br />amazingly similar to a particular episode in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ....the early <br />christians in the movies are shown to secretly identify themselves <br />to each other by drawing the sign of the fish ( on their foreheads, <br />on the ground etc).....a la ravidasan to alwarkadian on the river <br />front...</acronym></p>
<p>Incidentally - the Greek word for fish (ichthus, spelled: Iota Chi <br />Theta Upsilon Sigma). That is an acrostic for "Jesus Christ, of God, <br />the Son, the Savior" [Iesous (Jesus) CHristos (Christ) THeou (of <br />God) Uiou (the Son) Soter (the Savior)]. An acrostic is <br />an "arrangement of words in which the first letter of each line <br />ordinarily combines with others to form a word or words or the <br />alphabet..</p>
<p></p>

        <p>Precisely, Vasantha sena had 3 husbands, one was manohara's father. Her 1st one happens to kill her.<br />Nandini on the other hand, tried to rope in Aaditya, took over the falling veera pandya, married the age old Pazhuvettayar ... and eventually fell for Vallavarayan.</p>
<p>Both characters are closely over, both falling in the chola lineage add a mystery. Was Nandini entirely fictional?</p>

          nandhini Vs cleopatra        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Find replace_ Caesar with AK, Brutus n others with nandhini, <br />ravidasan, soman etc etc , the priests with kudanthai josier.....in <br />this account of Assasination of Caesar:</p>
<p>Nicolaus of Damascus wrote his account of the murder of Caesar a few <br />years after the event. He was not actually present when the <br />assassination occurred but had the opportunity to speak with those <br />who were. He was a friend of Herod the Great and gathered his <br />information during a visit to Rome. His account is thought to be <br />reliable. </p>
<p>The Plan: </p>
<p>"The conspirators never met openly, but they assembled a few at a <br />time in each others' homes. There were many discussions and <br />proposals, as might be expected, while they investigated how and <br />where to execute their design. Some suggested that they should make <br />the attempt as he was going along the Sacred Way, which was one of <br />his favorite walks. Another idea was for it to be done at the <br />elections during which he bad to cross a bridge to appoint the <br />magistrates in the Campus Martius; they should draw lots for some to <br />push him from the bridge and for others to run up and kill him. A <br />third plan was to wait for a coming gladiatorial show. The advantage <br />of that would be that, because of the show, no suspicion would be <br />aroused if arms were seen prepared for the attempt. But the majority <br />opinion favored killing him while he sat in the Senate, where he <br />would be by himself since non-Senators would not be admitted, and <br />where the many conspirators could hide their daggers beneath their <br />togas. This plan won the day." </p>
<p>Brutus Persuades Caesar to Ignore his Apprehensions: </p>
<p>"...his friends were alarmed at certain rumors and tried to stop him <br />going to the Senate-house, as did his doctors, for he was suffering <br />from one of his occasional dizzy spells. His wife, Calpurnia, <br />especially, who was frightened by some visions in her dreams, clung <br />to him and said that she would not let him go out that day. But <br />Brutus, one of the conspirators who was then thought of as a firm <br />friend, came up and said, 'What is this, Caesar? Are you a man to <br />pay attention to a woman's dreams and the idle gossip of stupid men, <br />and to insult the Senate by not going out, although it has honored <br />you and has been specially summoned by you? But listen to me, cast <br />aside the forebodings of all these people, and come. The Senate has <br />been in session waiting for you since early this morning.' This <br />swayed Caesar and he left." </p>
<p>Bad Omens: </p>
<p>"Before he entered the chamber, the priests brought up the victims <br />for him to make what was to be his last sacrifice. The omens were <br />clearly unfavorable. After this unsuccessful sacrifice, the priests <br />made repeated other ones, to see if anything more propitious might <br />appear than what had already been revealed to them. In the end they <br />said that they could not clearly see the divine intent, for there <br />was some transparent, malignant spirit hidden in the victims. Caesar <br />was annoyed and abandoned divination till sunset, though the priests <br />continued all the more with their efforts. </p>
<p>Those of the murderers present were delighted at all this, though <br />Caesar's friends asked him to put off the meeting of the Senate for <br />that day because of what the priests had said, and he agreed to do <br />this. But some attendants came up, calling him and saying that the <br />Senate was full. He glanced at his friends, but Brutus approached <br />him again and said, 'Come, good sir, pay no attention to the <br />babblings of these men, and do not postpone what Caesar and his <br />mighty power has seen fit to arrange. Make your own courage your <br />favorable omen.' He convinced Caesar with these words, took him by <br />the right hand, and led him to the Senate which was quite near. <br />Caesar followed in silence." </p>
<p>The Attack: </p>
<p>"The Senate rose in respect for his position when they saw him <br />entering. Those who were to have part in the plot stood near him. <br />Right next to him went Tillius Cimber, whose brother had been exiled <br />by Caesar. Under pretext of a humble request on behalf of this <br />brother, Cimber approached and grasped the mantle of his toga, <br />seeming to want to make a more positive move with his hands upon <br />Caesar. Caesar wanted to get up and use his hands, but was prevented <br />by Cimber and became exceedingly annoyed. </p>
<p>That was the moment for the men to set to work. All quickly <br />unsheathed their daggers and rushed at him. First Servilius Casca <br />struck him with the point of the blade on the left shoulder a little <br />above the collar-bone. He had been aiming for that, but in the <br />excitement he missed. Caesar rose to defend himself, and in the <br />uproar Casca shouted out in Greek to his brother. The latter heard <br />him and drove his sword into the ribs. After a moment, Cassius made <br />a slash at his face, and Decimus Brutus pierced him in the side. <br />While Cassius Longinus was trying to give him another blow he missed <br />and struck Marcus Brutus on the hand. Minucius also hit out at <br />Caesar and hit Rubrius in the thigh. They were just like men doing <br />battle against him. </p>
<p>Under the mass of wounds, he fell at the foot of Pompey's statue. <br />Everyone wanted to seem to have had some part in the murder, and <br />there was not one of them who failed to strike his body as it lay <br />there, until, wounded thirty-five times, he breathed his last. " </p>

<p>dumas is a must read - count of monte cristo would have been my <br />first choice ( even though the later portions do drag a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym )...while <br />the man in the iron mask has been remade twice in tamil ( switching <br />of the prince!)... the three musk...was good for the comedy stuff, <br />my first choice would be the count of monte cristo for its depth of <br />story line and stong narration...a man jailed without trail, <br />seperated from his lady love, ailing father - snatched away just <br />when he was about to have everything that he wished for - a captains <br />job, wedlock to his lady love-----kept in solitary confinement for <br />years - left to ponder on what went wrong, left to relive his last <br />few days of freedom in his mind - dissecting every act, every <br />person ....and then to understand the conspiracy..it was truely <br />amazing read.</acronym></p>

        <p>Vijay; You want someone (fictional or real) close in character to Nandhini, try<br />Milady De Winter from Alexander Dumas' "The Three Musketeers". i have<br />already bought this up in this group but anyways as this is always an<br />interesting topic.<br />Also whilst you are into the book (if you haven't read it already) im sure<br />you will find a lot of similarities between <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and 3 Musketeers!!</p>
