<p>Dr.A.Padmavathy</p>
<p>An inscription in the Natraja temple of Chidambaram, dated in the <br />reign of the Pandya ruler Jatavarman Sundara Panya refers to a land <br />gift made for the maintenance of a Manuscript Library in the Temple <br />of Natraja at Chidambaram.[2] The date of the inscription is around <br />1263 CE. It refers to the maintenance of the Library, conservation <br />of its palm leaf manuscripts collections, recopying old worn our <br />manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the copying the Mss and such <br />other works. The manuscripts preserved in the Library were in <br />different languages and scripts. Twenty Pundits were appointed for <br />copying manuscripts. Their work not only included copying on new <br />leaves but also comparing them with the original manuscripts. There <br />were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which were recopied. Among <br />many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta Ratnakara receives <br />special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge of the Library who <br />supervised the development of the Library, the works of the Pundits, <br />and also the administration of the manuscripts Library.</p>
<p>It is known that the word Swamidevar was used to denote the <br />Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial Chola times, <br />particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3]. Many Rajagurus are <br />mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in the Royal inscriptions<br />[4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5]. The Swamidevar <br />mentioned in the record served obviously as the Rajaguru. It is <br />interesting to note that another inscription from Chidambaram, dated <br />one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of Pallava chieftain <br />Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva , a Royal priest <br />(Udaiyar) who hailed from Dakshina Radha in the Uttara-patha. This <br />Isvara Siva had another name Thiruc-cirrambalam Udaiyan who made a <br />gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the same Isvara Siva who  <br />supervised the Manuscript Library at Chidambaram. </p>
<p>I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram inscription on the Manuscript <br />Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text Siddhanta ratnakara  <br />among the manuscripts collection. It is known that the Royal <br />preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the text Siddhanta <br />Ratnakara</p>
<p>around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the record is the same <br />written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this text has not survived. <br />The other point worthy of note is that this Royal preceptor was also <br />named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the author of the text and <br />the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were the same. The <br />manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called Sarswati Bhandara <br />i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in inscription. It would thus be <br />evident that the Manuscript Library was in existence in the <br />Chidambaram temple even from the time of Kulottunga II, (1150 CE)<br />before the time of the Pandyan record.</p>
<p>The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar on the lives of <br />Saivite Nayanm?rs was written in Chidambarm. It is well known that <br />Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in writing his work. His <br />work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is not unlikely that <br />he had access to a manuscript Library when he composed his text. <br />Sekkilar was at first a court poet under Kulottunga II (1133 to <br />1150). This would take the date of the Library to the mid 12th Cent.</p>
<p>Another record at Chidambaram mentions many gifts made by one <br />Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I and his son Vikrama <br />Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among various gifts he made <br />is a unique work that deserves special attention. He got all the <br />Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering about 8000 verses <br />engraved on copper plates and deposited them in the Chidambaram <br />temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses should have been <br />deposited in the Library of the temple. This would advance the date <br />of the Library to the beginning of the 12th cent.</p>
<p>An important event associated with the Tevaram hymns is the <br />discovery of the manuscripts by Rajaraja Chola I and Nambi Andar <br />Nambi around 1000 CE., mentioned in a mediaeval text ascribed to <br />Umapati Sivam. According to this episode Rajaraja discovered the <br />Tevaram manuscripts, with the help of Nambi, in a locked room, in a <br />corner of the Chidambaram temple. When Rajaraja discovered them, a <br />considerable number of the leaves of the text were eaten by white <br />ants and the bundles were found covered by an ant hill. Obviously <br />these manuscripts were part of a Library that was in a state of <br />neglect and it was Rajaraja who discovered them. The event points <br />out to the existence of the Library in the time of Rajaraja in the <br />beginning of the 11th cent.</p>
<p>Nambi Andar Nambi who helped Rajaraja to discover the manuscripts <br />wrote one hundred verses on the lives of the 63 Saivite saints.[10] <br />The work is called Thrut-tondar Thiru-antati.. it is known that this <br />text was based on the work Thirut-tondat-tokai of Saint Sundaramurti <br />Nayanar. This text of Saint Sundaramurti begins with the praise of <br />the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram (Tillai vaz ant?ar). Also it <br />gives the exploits of the 63 Saiva saints. Obviously Nambi Andar <br />Nambi was inspired by this text of Sundaramurti when he discovered <br />the manuscripts with Rajaraja. Tradition recorded in Umapati's work  <br />avers that the manuscripts were discovered in the north western <br />corner of the Second enclosure of the Nataraja temple. The image of <br />Ganesa nearby is said to have pointed to the direction where the <br />room with the manuscripts was located. The inscription of Sundara <br />Pandya referring to the manuscript Library is found in the north <br />western wall of the second enclosure, where the library is said to <br />have been located. The existence of the manuscript library could <br />now be traced to the time of Saint Sundara murti in the 8th cent. <br />The library existed with fluctuating fortunes for nearly 500 years <br />in the temple of Nataraja. </p>

<p>one small trivia.<br />why was the metal detector invented.<br />not for treasure or mines.<br />it was invented for finding bullets within a dying Us president who <br />had been shot by none other than alexander graham bell.<br />Alexander Graham Bell, instantaneously fabricated and used such a <br />device to attempt to locate a bullet lodged in the chest of American <br />President James Garfield in 1881, though the attempt was unsuccessful <br />because the metal bed Garfield was lying on confused the detector.</p>

<p>The equipment which i am working on is multipurpose earth scan.</p>
<p>using GPS as a base and go for contour map with the help of <br />electrical resistance to point out that area of operations specically <br />then using of GPR using radio frequencies to find out the objects up <br />to 30 meters without any trenching.this will be helpful to recover <br />copper plates and tresaure boxes.</p>
<p>in case if you find the objects , using latest drilling systems u can <br />particularly locate and remove it through inwell techniques.</p>
<p>My equipments can be used even for cavity findings, marine archealogy.<br />through optical fibre tech. remote cameras and gas analysing methods.</p>
<p>if any one need specically can be contactd me through personal mails.</p>

<p>      Dr.A.Padmavathy</p>
<p>      An inscription in the Natraja temple of Chidambaram,<br />      dated in the <br />      reign of the Pandya ruler Jatavarman Sundara Panya<br />      refers to a land <br />      gift made for the maintenance of a Manuscript<br />      Library in the Temple <br />      of Natraja at Chidambaram.[2] The date of the<br />      inscription is around <br />      1263 CE. It refers to the maintenance of the<br />      Library, conservation <br />      of its palm leaf manuscripts collections, recopying<br />      old worn our <br />      manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the copying<br />      the Mss and such <br />      other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />      Library were in <br />      different languages and scripts. Twenty Pundits<br />      were appointed for <br />      copying manuscripts. Their work not only included<br />      copying on new <br />      leaves but also comparing them with the original<br />      manuscripts. There <br />      were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which were<br />      recopied. Among <br />      many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />      Ratnakara receives <br />      special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge of the<br />      Library who <br />      supervised the development of the Library, the works<br />      of the Pundits, <br />      and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />      Library.</p>
<p>      It is known that the word Swamidevar was used to<br />      denote the <br />      Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial Chola<br />      times, <br />      particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3]. Many<br />      Rajagurus are <br />      mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in the<br />      Royal inscriptions<br />      [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5]. The<br />      Swamidevar <br />      mentioned in the record served obviously as the<br />      Rajaguru. It is <br />      interesting to note that another inscription from<br />      Chidambaram, dated <br />      one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of Pallava<br />      chieftain <br />      Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva , a<br />      Royal priest <br />      (Udaiyar) who hailed from Dakshina Radha in the<br />      Uttara-patha. This <br />      Isvara Siva had another name Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />      Udaiyan who made a <br />      gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the same<br />      Isvara Siva who  <br />      supervised the Manuscript Library at Chidambaram. </p>
<p>      I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram inscription<br />      on the Manuscript <br />      Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />      Siddhanta ratnakara  <br />      among the manuscripts collection. It is known that<br />      the Royal <br />      preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the text<br />      Siddhanta <br />      Ratnakara</p>
<p>      around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the record<br />      is the same <br />      written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this text has<br />      not survived. <br />      The other point worthy of note is that this Royal<br />      preceptor was also <br />      named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the author<br />      of the text and <br />      the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were the<br />      same. The <br />      manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called Sarswati<br />      Bhandara <br />      i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in inscription.<br />      It would thus be <br />      evident that the Manuscript Library was in existence<br />      in the <br />      Chidambaram temple even from the time of Kulottunga<br />      II, (1150 CE)<br />      before the time of the Pandyan record.</p>
<p>      The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar on<br />      the lives of <br />      Saivite Nayanm?rs was written in Chidambarm. It is<br />      well known that <br />      Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in<br />      writing his work. His <br />      work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is not<br />      unlikely that <br />      he had access to a manuscript Library when he<br />      composed his text. <br />      Sekkilar was at first a court poet under Kulottunga<br />      II (1133 to <br />      1150). This would take the date of the Library to<br />      the mid 12th Cent.</p>
<p>      Another record at Chidambaram mentions many gifts<br />      made by one <br />      Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I and<br />      his son Vikrama <br />      Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />      various gifts he made <br />      is a unique work that deserves special attention. He<br />      got all the <br />      Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering about<br />      8000 verses <br />      engraved on copper plates and deposited them in the<br />      Chidambaram <br />      temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses<br />      should have been <br />      deposited in the Library of the temple. This would<br />      advance the date <br />      of the Library to the beginning of the 12th cent.</p>
<p>      An important event associated with the Tevaram hymns<br />      is the <br />      discovery of the manuscripts by Rajaraja Chola I and<br />      Nambi Andar <br />      Nambi around 1000 CE., mentioned in a mediaeval text<br />      ascribed to <br />      Umapati Sivam. According to this episode Rajaraja<br />      discovered the <br />      Tevaram manuscripts, with the help of Nambi, in a<br />      locked room, in a <br />      corner of the Chidambaram temple. When Rajaraja<br />      discovered them, a <br />      considerable number of the leaves of the text were<br />      eaten by white <br />      ants and the bundles were found covered by an ant<br />      hill. Obviously <br />      these manuscripts were part of a Library that was in<br />      a state of <br />      neglect and it was Rajaraja who discovered them. The<br />      event points <br />      out to the existence of the Library in the time of<br />      Rajaraja in the <br />      beginning of the 11th cent.</p>
<p>      Nambi Andar Nambi who helped Rajaraja to discover<br />      the manuscripts <br />      wrote one hundred verses on the lives of the 63<br />      Saivite saints.[10] <br />      The work is called Thrut-tondar Thiru-antati.. it is<br />      known that this <br />      text was based on the work Thirut-tondat-tokai of<br />      Saint Sundaramurti <br />      Nayanar. This text of Saint Sundaramurti begins with<br />      the praise of <br />      the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram (Tillai vaz<br />      ant?ar). Also it <br />      gives the exploits of the 63 Saiva saints. Obviously<br />      Nambi Andar <br />      Nambi was inspired by this text of Sundaramurti when<br />      he discovered <br />      the manuscripts with Rajaraja. Tradition recorded in<br />      Umapati's work  <br />      avers that the manuscripts were discovered in the<br />      north western <br />      corner of the Second enclosure of the Nataraja<br />      temple. The image of <br />      Ganesa nearby is said to have pointed to the<br />      direction where the <br />      room with the manuscripts was located. The<br />      inscription of Sundara <br />      Pandya referring to the manuscript Library is found<br />      in the north <br />      western wall of the second enclosure, where the<br />      library is said to <br />      have been located. The existence of the manuscript<br />      library could <br />      now be traced to the time of Saint Sundara murti in<br />      the 8th cent. </p>

        <p>I am not a technical guy on this - but someone can check and advise <br />if we can use metal detectors to to detect metals underneath floors <br />or inside walls - they do use electromagnetic induction to detect <br />metal - and we see them being used extensively even by novices on <br />beach sand. the other questions if you would be allowed to do such <br />inside our temples.</p>

<p>    Dr.A.Padmavathy</p>
<p>    An inscription in the Natraja temple of Chidambaram,<br />    dated in the <br />    reign of the Pandya ruler Jatavarman Sundara Panya<br />    refers to a land <br />    gift made for the maintenance of a Manuscript<br />    Library in the Temple <br />    of Natraja at Chidambaram.[2] The date of the<br />    inscription is around <br />    1263 CE. It refers to the maintenance of the<br />    Library, conservation <br />    of its palm leaf manuscripts collections, recopying<br />    old worn our <br />    manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the copying<br />    the Mss and such <br />    other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />    Library were in <br />    different languages and scripts. Twenty Pundits<br />    were appointed for <br />    copying manuscripts. Their work not only included<br />    copying on new <br />    leaves but also comparing them with the original<br />    manuscripts. There <br />    were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which were<br />    recopied. Among <br />    many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />    Ratnakara receives <br />    special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge of the<br />    Library who <br />    supervised the development of the Library, the works<br />    of the Pundits, <br />    and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />    Library.</p>
<p>    It is known that the word Swamidevar was used to<br />    denote the <br />    Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial Chola<br />    times, <br />    particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3]. Many<br />    Rajagurus are <br />    mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in the<br />    Royal inscriptions<br />    [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5]. The<br />    Swamidevar <br />    mentioned in the record served obviously as the<br />    Rajaguru. It is <br />    interesting to note that another inscription from<br />    Chidambaram, dated <br />    one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of Pallava<br />    chieftain <br />    Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva , a<br />    Royal priest <br />    (Udaiyar) who hailed from Dakshina Radha in the<br />    Uttara-patha. This <br />    Isvara Siva had another name Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />    Udaiyan who made a <br />    gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the same<br />    Isvara Siva who  <br />    supervised the Manuscript Library at Chidambaram. </p>
<p>    I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram inscription<br />    on the Manuscript <br />    Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />    Siddhanta ratnakara  <br />    among the manuscripts collection. It is known that<br />    the Royal <br />    preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the text<br />    Siddhanta <br />    Ratnakara</p>
<p>    around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the record<br />    is the same <br />    written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this text has<br />    not survived. <br />    The other point worthy of note is that this Royal<br />    preceptor was also <br />    named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the author<br />    of the text and <br />    the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were the<br />    same. The <br />    manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called Sarswati<br />    Bhandara <br />    i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in inscription.<br />    It would thus be <br />    evident that the Manuscript Library was in existence<br />    in the <br />    Chidambaram temple even from the time of Kulottunga<br />    II, (1150 CE)<br />    before the time of the Pandyan record.</p>
<p>    The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar on<br />    the lives of <br />    Saivite Nayanm?rs was written in Chidambarm. It is<br />    well known that <br />    Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in<br />    writing his work. His <br />    work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is not<br />    unlikely that <br />    he had access to a manuscript Library when he<br />    composed his text. <br />    Sekkilar was at first a court poet under Kulottunga<br />    II (1133 to <br />    1150). This would take the date of the Library to<br />    the mid 12th Cent.</p>
<p>    Another record at Chidambaram mentions many gifts<br />    made by one <br />    Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I and<br />    his son Vikrama <br />    Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />    various gifts he made <br />    is a unique work that deserves special attention. He<br />    got all the <br />    Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering about<br />    8000 verses <br />    engraved on copper plates and deposited them in the<br />    Chidambaram <br />    temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses<br />    should have been <br />    deposited in the Library of the temple. This would<br />    advance the date <br />    of the Library to the beginning of the 12th cent.</p>
<p>    An important event associated with the Tevaram hymns<br />    is the <br />    discovery of the manuscripts by Rajaraja Chola I and<br />    Nambi Andar <br />    Nambi around 1000 CE., mentioned in a mediaeval text<br />    ascribed to <br />    Umapati Sivam. According to this episode Rajaraja<br />    discovered the <br />    Tevaram manuscripts, with the help of Nambi, in a<br />    locked room, in a <br />    corner of the Chidambaram temple. When Rajaraja<br />    discovered them, a <br />    considerable number of the leaves of the text were<br />    eaten by white <br />    ants and the bundles were found covered by an ant<br />    hill. Obviously <br />    these manuscripts were part of a Library that was in<br />    a state of <br />    neglect and it was Rajaraja who discovered them. The<br />    event points <br />    out to the existence of the Library in the time of<br />    Rajaraja in the <br />    beginning of the 11th cent.</p>
<p>    Nambi Andar Nambi who helped Rajaraja to discover<br />    the manuscripts <br />    wrote one hundred verses on the lives of the 63<br />    Saivite saints.[10] <br />    The work is called Thrut-tondar Thiru-antati.. it is<br />    known that this <br />    text was based on the work Thirut-tondat-tokai of<br />    Saint Sundaramurti <br />    Nayanar. This text of Saint Sundaramurti begins with<br />    the praise of <br />    the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram (Tillai vaz<br />    ant?ar). Also it <br />    gives the exploits of the 63 Saiva saints. Obviously<br />    Nambi Andar <br />    Nambi was inspired by this text of Sundaramurti when<br />    he discovered <br />    the manuscripts with Rajaraja. Tradition recorded in<br />    Umapati's work  <br />    avers that the manuscripts were discovered in the<br />    north western <br />    corner of the Second enclosure of the Nataraja<br />    temple. The image of <br />    Ganesa nearby is said to have pointed to the<br />    direction where the <br />    room with the manuscripts was located. The<br />    inscription of Sundara <br />    Pandya referring to the manuscript Library is found<br />    in the north <br />    western wall of the second enclosure, where the<br />    library is said to <br />    have been located. The existence of the manuscript<br />    library could <br />    now be traced to the time of Saint Sundara murti in<br />    the 8th cent. </p>

<p>        An inscription in the Natraja temple of<br />    Chidambaram,<br />        dated in the <br />        reign of the Pandya ruler Jatavarman Sundara<br />    Panya<br />        refers to a land <br />        gift made for the maintenance of a Manuscript<br />        Library in the Temple <br />        of Natraja at Chidambaram.[2] The date of the<br />        inscription is around <br />        1263 CE.

<p>        It is known that the word Swamidevar was used to<br />        denote the <br />        Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial<br />    Chola<br />        times, <br />        particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3]. Many<br />        Rajagurus are <br />        mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in the<br />        Royal inscriptions<br />        [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5]. The<br />        Swamidevar <br />        mentioned in the record served obviously as the<br />        Rajaguru.

The <br />        manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called<br />    Sarswati<br />        Bhandara <br />        i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in<br />    inscription.<br />        It would thus be <br />        evident that the Manuscript Library was in<br />    existence<br />        in the <br />        Chidambaram temple even from the time of<br />    Kulottunga<br />        II, (1150 CE)<br />        before the time of the Pandyan record.</p>
<p>        The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar<br />    on<br />        the lives of <br />        Saivite Nayanm?rs was written in Chidambarm. It<br />    is<br />        well known that <br />        Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in<br />        writing his work. His <br />        work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is<br />    not<br />        unlikely that <br />        he had access to a manuscript Library when he<br />        composed his text. <br />        Sekkilar was at first a court poet under<br />    Kulottunga<br />        II (1133 to <br />        1150). This would take the date of the Library<br />    to<br />        the mid 12th Cent.</p>
<p>        Another record at Chidambaram mentions many<br />    gifts<br />        made by one <br />        Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I<br />    and<br />        his son Vikrama <br />        Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />        various gifts he made <br />        is a unique work that deserves special<br />    attention. He<br />        got all the <br />        Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering<br />    about<br />        8000 verses <br />        engraved on copper plates and deposited them in<br />    the<br />        Chidambaram <br />        temple[9].

<p>    Where do you live? You are sending so much of valuable<br />    information everyday... Keep it up.</p>
<p>    So there could be many more such palm leaf manuscripts<br />    waiting out there to be located / published... ( One<br />    of my ambition is to bring out such a sankam age text<br />    thought to be lost. I hope I can do that in my<br />    lifetime. )</p>
<p>    Do you have a list of these private collectors? We can<br />    write to them and request them to help us to publish<br />    the contents ( they can continue to own the palm leaf<br />    in their collection. all we need is the content )</p>
<p>    Recently the TN govt also did a survey and found<br />    several thousand palm leaf texts in the possession of<br />    individuals in southern cities.. dont know what<br />    happened to that.. but alteast bringing their contents<br />    out is lot more easier than dealing with our Mysore<br />    friends.. </p>
<p>    Like the temple cleaners group, we should also have a<br />    palm leaf rescuers group as well.</p>

<p>            Dr.A.Padmavathy</p>
<p>            An inscription in the Natraja temple of<br />      Chidambaram,<br />            dated in the <br />            reign of the Pandya ruler Jatavarman Sundara<br />      Panya<br />            refers to a land <br />            gift made for the maintenance of a Manuscript<br />            Library in the Temple <br />            of Natraja at Chidambaram.[2] The date of the<br />            inscription is around <br />            1263 CE. It refers to the maintenance of the<br />            Library, conservation <br />            of its palm leaf manuscripts collections,<br />      recopying<br />            old worn our <br />            manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the<br />      copying<br />            the Mss and such <br />            other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />            Library were in <br />            different languages and scripts. Twenty<br />      Pundits<br />            were appointed for <br />            copying manuscripts. Their work not only<br />      included<br />            copying on new <br />            leaves but also comparing them with the<br />      original<br />            manuscripts. There <br />            were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which<br />      were<br />            recopied. Among <br />            many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />            Ratnakara receives <br />            special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge<br />      of the<br />            Library who <br />            supervised the development of the Library, the<br />      works<br />            of the Pundits, <br />            and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />            Library.</p>
<p>            It is known that the word Swamidevar was used<br />      to<br />            denote the <br />            Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial<br />      Chola<br />            times, <br />            particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3].<br />      Many<br />            Rajagurus are <br />            mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in<br />      the<br />            Royal inscriptions<br />            [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5].<br />      The<br />            Swamidevar <br />            mentioned in the record served obviously as<br />      the<br />            Rajaguru. It is <br />            interesting to note that another inscription<br />      from<br />            Chidambaram, dated <br />            one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of<br />      Pallava<br />            chieftain <br />            Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva ,<br />      a<br />            Royal priest <br />            (Udaiyar) who hailed from Dakshina Radha in<br />      the<br />            Uttara-patha. This <br />            Isvara Siva had another name<br />      Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />            Udaiyan who made a <br />            gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the<br />      same<br />            Isvara Siva who  <br />            supervised the Manuscript Library at<br />      Chidambaram. </p>
<p>            I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram<br />      inscription<br />            on the Manuscript <br />            Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />            Siddhanta ratnakara  <br />            among the manuscripts collection. It is known<br />      that<br />            the Royal <br />            preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the<br />      text<br />            Siddhanta <br />            Ratnakara</p>
<p>            around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the<br />      record<br />            is the same <br />            written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this<br />      text has<br />            not survived. <br />            The other point worthy of note is that this<br />      Royal<br />            preceptor was also <br />            named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the<br />      author<br />            of the text and <br />            the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were<br />      the<br />            same.

<p>  Recently the TN govt also did a survey and found<br />  several thousand palm leaf texts in the possession of<br />  individuals in southern cities.. dont know what<br />  happened to that.. but alteast bringing their contents<br />  out is lot more easier than dealing with our Mysore<br />  friends.. </p>
<p>  Like the temple cleaners group, we should also have a<br />  palm leaf rescuers group as well.</p>

<p>          Dr.A.Padmavathy</p>
<p>          An inscription in the Natraja temple of<br />    Chidambaram,<br />          dated in the <br />          reign of the Pandya ruler Jatavarman Sundara<br />    Panya<br />          refers to a land <br />          gift made for the maintenance of a Manuscript<br />          Library in the Temple <br />          of Natraja at Chidambaram.[2] The date of the<br />          inscription is around <br />          1263 CE. It refers to the maintenance of the<br />          Library, conservation <br />          of its palm leaf manuscripts collections,<br />    recopying<br />          old worn our <br />          manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the<br />    copying<br />          the Mss and such <br />          other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />          Library were in <br />          different languages and scripts. Twenty<br />    Pundits<br />          were appointed for <br />          copying manuscripts. Their work not only<br />    included<br />          copying on new <br />          leaves but also comparing them with the<br />    original<br />          manuscripts. There <br />          were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which<br />    were<br />          recopied. Among <br />          many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />          Ratnakara receives <br />          special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge<br />    of the<br />          Library who <br />          supervised the development of the Library, the<br />    works<br />          of the Pundits, <br />          and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />          Library.</p>
<p>          It is known that the word Swamidevar was used<br />    to<br />          denote the <br />          Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial<br />    Chola<br />          times, <br />          particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3].<br />    Many<br />          Rajagurus are <br />          mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in<br />    the<br />          Royal inscriptions<br />          [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5].<br />    The<br />          Swamidevar <br />          mentioned in the record served obviously as<br />    the<br />          Rajaguru. It is <br />          interesting to note that another inscription<br />    from<br />          Chidambaram, dated <br />          one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of<br />    Pallava<br />          chieftain <br />          Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva ,<br />    a<br />          Royal priest <br />          (Udaiyar) who hailed from Dakshina Radha in<br />    the<br />          Uttara-patha. This <br />          Isvara Siva had another name<br />    Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />          Udaiyan who made a <br />          gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the<br />    same<br />          Isvara Siva who  <br />          supervised the Manuscript Library at<br />    Chidambaram. </p>
<p>          I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram<br />    inscription<br />          on the Manuscript <br />          Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />          Siddhanta ratnakara  <br />          among the manuscripts collection. It is known<br />    that<br />          the Royal <br />          preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the<br />    text<br />          Siddhanta <br />          Ratnakara</p>
<p>          around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the<br />    record<br />          is the same <br />          written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this<br />    text has<br />          not survived. <br />          The other point worthy of note is that this<br />    Royal<br />          preceptor was also <br />          named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the<br />    author<br />          of the text and <br />          the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were<br />    the<br />          same. The <br />          manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called<br />    Sarswati<br />          Bhandara <br />          i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in<br />    inscription.<br />          It would thus be <br />          evident that the Manuscript Library was in<br />    existence<br />          in the <br />          Chidambaram temple even from the time of<br />    Kulottunga<br />          II, (1150 CE)<br />          before the time of the Pandyan record.</p>
<p>          The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by<br />    Sekkilar on<br />          the lives of <br />          Saivite Nayanm?rs was written in Chidambarm.<br />    It <br />  === message truncated ===</p>

<p>      Dr.A.Padmavathy</p>
<p>      An inscription in the Natraja temple of<br />  Chidambaram,<br />      dated in the <br />      reign of the Pandya ruler Jatavarman Sundara<br />  Panya<br />      refers to a land <br />      gift made for the maintenance of a Manuscript<br />      Library in the Temple <br />      of Natraja at Chidambaram.[2] The date of the<br />      inscription is around <br />      1263 CE. It refers to the maintenance of the<br />      Library, conservation <br />      of its palm leaf manuscripts collections,<br />  recopying<br />      old worn our <br />      manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the<br />  copying<br />      the Mss and such <br />      other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />      Library were in <br />      different languages and scripts. Twenty Pundits<br />      were appointed for <br />      copying manuscripts. Their work not only<br />  included<br />      copying on new <br />      leaves but also comparing them with the original<br />      manuscripts. There <br />      were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which were<br />      recopied. Among <br />      many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />      Ratnakara receives <br />      special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge of<br />  the<br />      Library who <br />      supervised the development of the Library, the<br />  works<br />      of the Pundits, <br />      and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />      Library.</p>
<p>      It is known that the word Swamidevar was used to<br />      denote the <br />      Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial<br />  Chola<br />      times, <br />      particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3]. Many<br />      Rajagurus are <br />      mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in the<br />      Royal inscriptions<br />      [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5]. The<br />      Swamidevar <br />      mentioned in the record served obviously as the<br />      Rajaguru. It is <br />      interesting to note that another inscription<br />  from<br />      Chidambaram, dated <br />      one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of<br />  Pallava<br />      chieftain <br />      Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva , a<br />      Royal priest <br />      (Udaiyar) who hailed from Dakshina Radha in the<br />      Uttara-patha. This <br />      Isvara Siva had another name Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />      Udaiyan who made a <br />      gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the<br />  same<br />      Isvara Siva who <br />      supervised the Manuscript Library at<br />  Chidambaram. </p>
<p>      I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram<br />  inscription<br />      on the Manuscript <br />      Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />      Siddhanta ratnakara <br />      among the manuscripts collection. It is known<br />  that<br />      the Royal <br />      preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the<br />  text<br />      Siddhanta <br />      Ratnakara</p>
<p>      around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the<br />  record<br />      is the same <br />      written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this text<br />  has<br />      not survived. <br />      The other point worthy of note is that this<br />  Royal<br />      preceptor was also <br />      named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the<br />  author<br />      of the text and <br />      the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were<br />  the<br />      same. The <br />      manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called<br />  Sarswati<br />      Bhandara <br />      i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in<br />  inscription.<br />      It would thus be <br />      evident that the Manuscript Library was in<br />  existence<br />      in the <br />      Chidambaram temple even from the time of<br />  Kulottunga<br />      II, (1150 CE)<br />      before the time of the Pandyan record.</p>
<p>      The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar<br />  on<br />      the lives of <br />      Saivite Nayanm?rs was written in Chidambarm. It<br />  is<br />      well known that <br />      Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in<br />      writing his work. His <br />      work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is<br />  not<br />      unlikely that <br />      he had access to a manuscript Library when he<br />      composed his text. <br />      Sekkilar was at first a court poet under<br />  Kulottunga<br />      II (1133 to <br />      1150). This would take the date of the Library<br />  to<br />      the mid 12th Cent.</p>
<p>      Another record at Chidambaram mentions many<br />  gifts<br />      made by one <br />      Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I<br />  and<br />      his son Vikrama <br />      Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />      various gifts he made <br />      is a unique work that deserves special<br />  attention. He<br />      got all the <br />      Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering<br />  about<br />      8000 verses <br />      engraved on copper plates and deposited them in<br />  the<br />      Chidambaram <br />      temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses<br />      should have been </p>

<p>      I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram inscription<br />      on the Manuscript <br />      Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />      Siddhanta ratnakara  <br />      among the manuscripts collection.

Unfortunately this text has<br />      not survived. <br />      The other point worthy of note is that this Royal<br />      preceptor was also <br />      named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the author<br />      of the text and <br />      the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were the<br />      same. The <br />      manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called Sarswati<br />      Bhandara <br />      i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in inscription.<br />      It would thus be <br />      evident that the Manuscript Library was in existence<br />      in the <br />      Chidambaram temple even from the time of Kulottunga<br />      II, (1150 CE)<br />      before the time of the Pandyan record.</p>
<p>      The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar on<br />      the lives of <br />      Saivite Nayanm?rs was written in Chidambarm. It is<br />      well known that <br />      Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in<br />      writing his work. His <br />      work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is not<br />      unlikely that <br />      he had access to a manuscript Library when he<br />      composed his text. <br />      Sekkilar was at first a court poet under Kulottunga<br />      II (1133 to <br />      1150). This would take the date of the Library to<br />      the mid 12th Cent.</p>
<p>      Another record at Chidambaram mentions many gifts<br />      made by one <br />      Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I and<br />      his son Vikrama <br />      Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />      various gifts he made <br />      is a unique work that deserves special attention. He<br />      got all the <br />      Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering about<br />      8000 verses <br />      engraved on copper plates and deposited them in the<br />      Chidambaram <br />      temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses<br />      should have been <br />      deposited in the Library of the temple. This would<br />      advance the date <br />      of the Library to the beginning of the 12th cent.</p>
<p>      An important event associated with the Tevaram hymns<br />      is the <br />      discovery of the manuscripts by Rajaraja Chola I and<br />      Nambi Andar <br />      Nambi around 1000 CE., mentioned in a mediaeval text<br />      ascribed to <br />      Umapati Sivam. According to this episode Rajaraja<br />      discovered the <br />      Tevaram manuscripts, with the help of Nambi, in a<br />      locked room, in a <br />      corner of the Chidambaram temple. When Rajaraja<br />      discovered them, a <br />      considerable number of the leaves of the text were<br />      eaten by white <br />      ants and the bundles were found covered by an ant<br />      hill. Obviously <br />      these manuscripts were part of a Library that was in<br />      a state of <br />      neglect and it was Rajaraja who discovered them. The<br />      event points <br />      out to the existence of the Library in the time of<br />      Rajaraja in the <br />      beginning of the 11th cent.</p>
<p>      Nambi Andar Nambi who helped Rajaraja to discover<br />      the manuscripts <br />      wrote one hundred verses on the lives of the 63<br />      Saivite saints.[10] <br />      The work is called Thrut-tondar Thiru-antati.. it is<br />      known that this <br />      text was based on the work Thirut-tondat-tokai of<br />      Saint Sundaramurti <br />      Nayanar. This text of Saint Sundaramurti begins with<br />      the praise of <br />      the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram (Tillai vaz<br />      ant?ar). Also it <br />      gives the exploits of the 63 Saiva saints. Obviously<br />      Nambi Andar <br />      Nambi was inspired by this text of Sundaramurti when<br />      he discovered <br />      the manuscripts with Rajaraja.

<p>    Dr.A.Padmavathy</p>
<p>    An inscription in the Natraja temple of Chidambaram,<br />    dated in the <br />    reign of the Pandya ruler Jatavarman Sundara Panya<br />    refers to a land <br />    gift made for the maintenance of a Manuscript<br />    Library in the Temple <br />    of Natraja at Chidambaram.[2] The date of the<br />    inscription is around <br />    1263 CE. It refers to the maintenance of the<br />    Library, conservation <br />    of its palm leaf manuscripts collections, recopying<br />    old worn our <br />    manuscripts, appointment of Pundits for the copying<br />    the Mss and such <br />    other works. The manuscripts preserved in the<br />    Library were in <br />    different languages and scripts. Twenty Pundits<br />    were appointed for <br />    copying manuscripts. Their work not only included<br />    copying on new <br />    leaves but also comparing them with the original<br />    manuscripts. There <br />    were many works in Tamil and Sanskrit which were<br />    recopied. Among <br />    many Sanskrit manuscripts one named Siddhanta<br />    Ratnakara receives <br />    special mention. One Swamidevar was in charge of the<br />    Library who <br />    supervised the development of the Library, the works<br />    of the Pundits, <br />    and also the administration of the manuscripts<br />    Library.</p>
<p>    It is known that the word Swamidevar was used to<br />    denote the <br />    Rajaguru, the Royal preceptor in the Imperial Chola<br />    times, <br />    particularly from the time of Rajaraja[3]. Many<br />    Rajagurus are <br />    mentioned in the 11th to 13th centuries in the<br />    Royal inscriptions<br />    [4]. A number of them hailed from Bengal[5]. The<br />    Swamidevar <br />    mentioned in the record served obviously as the<br />    Rajaguru. It is <br />    interesting to note that another inscription from<br />    Chidambaram, dated <br />    one year earlier, in 1262 in the reign of Pallava<br />    chieftain <br />    Kopperuncinga mentions a certain Isvara Siva , a<br />    Royal priest <br />    (Udaiyar) who hailed from Dakshina Radha in the<br />    Uttara-patha. This <br />    Isvara Siva had another name Thiruc-cirrambalam<br />    Udaiyan who made a <br />    gift of flower garden.[6] Evidently it is the same<br />    Isvara Siva who  <br />    supervised the Manuscript Library at Chidambaram. </p>
<p>    I have mentioned that the Chidmabaram inscription<br />    on the Manuscript <br />    Library specially refers to a Sanskrit text<br />    Siddhanta ratnakara  <br />    among the manuscripts collection. It is known that<br />    the Royal <br />    preceptor to Kulottunga Chola III[7] wrote the text<br />    Siddhanta <br />    Ratnakara</p>
<p>    around 1200 CE and the text mentioned in the record<br />    is the same <br />    written by Isvara Siva.. Unfortunately this text has<br />    not survived. <br />    The other point worthy of note is that this Royal<br />    preceptor was also <br />    named Isvara Siva[8] . In all likelihood the author<br />    of the text and <br />    the supervisor of the Manuscript Library were the<br />    same. The <br />    manuscript Library at Chidambaram is called Sarswati<br />    Bhandara <br />    i.e. "Treasure house of knowledge", in inscription.<br />    It would thus be <br />    evident that the Manuscript Library was in existence<br />    in the <br />    Chidambaram temple even from the time of Kulottunga<br />    II, (1150 CE)<br />    before the time of the Pandyan record.</p>
<p>    The great Tamil text Periya Puranam by Sekkilar on<br />    the lives of <br />    Saivite Nayanm?rs was written in Chidambarm. It is<br />    well known that <br />    Sekkilar consulted many valuable documents in<br />    writing his work. His <br />    work contains many Siddhantic thoughts and it is not<br />    unlikely that <br />    he had access to a manuscript Library when he<br />    composed his text. <br />    Sekkilar was at first a court poet under Kulottunga<br />    II (1133 to <br />    1150). This would take the date of the Library to<br />    the mid 12th Cent.</p>
<p>    Another record at Chidambaram mentions many gifts<br />    made by one <br />    Naralokaviran, a Commander under Kulottunga I and<br />    his son Vikrama <br />    Chola in the beginning of the 12th cent. Among<br />    various gifts he made <br />    is a unique work that deserves special attention. He<br />    got all the <br />    Tevaram hymns of the Saivite saints numbering about<br />    8000 verses <br />    engraved on copper plates and deposited them in the<br />    Chidambaram <br />    temple[9]. The copper plates carrying the verses<br />    should have been <br />    deposited in the Library of the temple. This would<br />    advance the date <br />    of the Library to the beginning of the 12th cent.</p>
<p>    An important event associated with the Tevaram hymns<br />    is the <br />    discovery of the manuscripts by Rajaraja Chola I and<br />    Nambi Andar <br />    Nambi around 1000 CE., mentioned in a mediaeval text<br />    ascribed to <br />    Umapati Sivam. According to this episode Rajaraja<br />    discovered the <br />    Tevaram manuscripts, with the help of Nambi, in a<br />    locked room, in a <br />    corner of the Chidambaram temple. When Rajaraja<br />    discovered them, a <br />    considerable number of the leaves of the text were<br />    eaten by white <br />    ants and the bundles were found covered by an ant<br />    hill. Obviously <br />    these manuscripts were part of a Library that was in<br />    a state of <br />    neglect and it was Rajaraja who discovered them. The<br />    event points <br />    out to the existence of the Library in the time of<br />    Rajaraja in the <br />    beginning of the 11th cent.</p>
<p>    Nambi Andar Nambi who helped Rajaraja to discover<br />    the manuscripts <br />    wrote one hundred verses on the lives of the 63<br />    Saivite saints.[10] <br />    The work is called Thrut-tondar Thiru-antati.. it is<br />    known that this <br />    text was based on the work Thirut-tondat-tokai of<br />    Saint Sundaramurti <br />    Nayanar. This text of Saint Sundaramurti begins with<br />    the praise of <br />    the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram (Tillai vaz<br />    ant?ar). Also it <br />    gives the exploits of the 63 Saiva saints. Obviously<br />    Nambi Andar <br />    Nambi was inspired by this text of Sundaramurti when<br />    he discovered <br />    the manuscripts with Rajaraja. Tradition recorded in<br />    Umapati's work  <br />    avers that the manuscripts were discovered in the<br />    north western <br />    corner of the Second enclosure of the Nataraja<br />    temple. The image of <br />    Ganesa nearby is said to have pointed to the<br />    direction where the <br />    room with the manuscripts was located. The<br />    inscription of Sundara <br />    Pandya referring to the manuscript Library is found<br />    in the north <br />    western wall of the second enclosure, where the<br />    library is said to <br />    have been located. The existence of the manuscript<br />    library could <br />    now be traced to the time of Saint Sundara murti in<br />    the 8th cent. </p>

The existence of the manuscript<br />  library could <br />  now be traced to the time of Saint Sundara murti in<br />  the 8th cent. </p>

<p>Introduction: The sacred sequence of the Sixty-Three Nayanars By <br />Vidya Dehejia</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skandagurunatha.org/deities/siva/nayanars/introduction_sac" title="http://www.skandagurunatha.org/deities/siva/nayanars/introduction_sac">http://www.skandagurunatha.org/deities/siva/nayanars/introduction_sac</a><br />red_sequence.asp</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------</p>
<p>Inspired by Siva, the Saint Sundarar who lived in the eighth <br />century, sang the Thiru-Thondar-Thogai pathigam at the temple of <br />Thiruvarur.</p>
<p>Proper english pronunciation = "thiru-thoNdar-thOgai path-ee-gam" ? <br />a song about the "Assembly of the sacred slaves at thiru-vaa-roor" <br />temple. </p>
<p>This hymn is the original list of the Saiva Saints, and Sundarar <br />apparently listed the names in the order in which he happened to <br />recollect them. The list follows a random sequence, being neither <br />chronological, nor alphabetical, nor grouped according to caste or <br />occupation. Since Sundarar sang the glory of the saints at the <br />command of God Siva himself, the list became a sanctified one. It <br />was elaborated by Nambi-Andar-Nambi in the tenth century and <br />codified by Sekkilaar in the twelfth-century work ? the Periya-<br />Puranam ? but the sequence remained unaltered. The order of this <br />list is meticulously followed in the temples for the placement of <br />bronze or stone images of the Nayanars, as also for their figures on <br />the temple walls.</p>
<p>God Siva's 63 Nayanars:<br />(as given by Saint Sundarar)</p>
<p>01. Thiru-Nilakantar 02. Iyarpagai 03. (Ilaiyangudi) Marar   <br />04. Meyporul 05. Viranmindar 06. Amarnithi 07. Eripathar 08. <br />Enathi 09. Kanappar 10. (Kungiliya) Kalayar 11.
