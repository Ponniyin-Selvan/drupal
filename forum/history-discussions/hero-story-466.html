</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I saw that there was a signigicant discussion of who actually was the hero Vandhiyadevan or arulmozhi....It was very interesting to see all your veiws about kalki trying to sideline <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  and his personality and popularity making him immortal...lets face it If he has made a charecter being analysed after so many decades of his creation is the author's victory....</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is most historic novels use charectors in the sideline as major players because you can use them with a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of Creator's imagination and liberty as opposed to certified figures of history..</p>
<p>Eg Paranchothi in Sivagamiyin sabatham though the main charector is Narasimha pallava.</p>
<p>Parthiban Kanavu...Parthiban though the main Hero is Mahindra varma Palava</p>
<p>Vanthiyadevan in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym </p>
<p>Ilango in Vengaiin mainthan(Akilan)..though the main charector is Rajendra Chola and his victories</p>
<p>Ilayapallavan in KadalPura (Sandilyan)...which was set in the later period of cholas During the Kalingathu parani era featuring Abaya Kulothunga</p>
<p>Ilanchelian in Yavanarani.(Sandilyan)set during the ascension of Karikalan of sangam period</p>
<p>It just enables the authors to mix facts with fiction and give us a blend.For Historic novel buff Kadakpura and Yavanarani are a must read...</p>

        <p>hi <br />i really enjoy those movies. I think those people suit those <br />charecters well. MGR and sarojadevi as well as jemini and vijayanthi. <br />Especially vijayanthi suits well for the charecter of kundavai with <br />that "gambeeram and beauti" . I like MGR for the role of narasimma <br />with since he was romantic and strengthy hero. And even i imagine our <br /><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  only through him. But i cant imagine the heroines of our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . Do u <br />have any choice<br />with regards<br />dzam<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "R.venketesh" <abhivencat@...  <br />wrote:</abhivencat@...></acronym></p>
<blockquote><p>  hi <br />  if you have seen the movie kalangarai vilakkam ( mgr and saroja <br />devi <br />  in "pon ezhil poothathu puthu vaanil" song) or parthiban kanavu( <br />  gemini and vyjyanthimala) and then read kalki's books you tend to <br />  imagine the charecters the same way<br />  if its the other way about you hate the movies.</p>

<p>    ok ok..............let me come to an end. I didnt analysed all <br />  these. I thought of only about our tamil film heroes with the <br />  qualifications of our tamil culture like "Kadal , Veeram and so <br />  on.........." in that aspect i imagine Narasimma varmar and VT. <br />    thanks <br />    dzam</p>

<p>    for argument sake - first we need to define who a hero is - hero <br />in <br />    fiction, hero's in flims ( ok we need to sub group - english film <br />    hero ,cartoon film hero, tamil film hero, telugu film hero, <br />    malayalam film hero, bengali film hero.....) and then there are <br />    double act ( dual role), thankfully dasavartharam is not released <br />    yet.</p>
<p>    If you ask me in SS, there are many heros - Naganandhi adigal - <br />he <br />    moves right through the book, even though you would call him the <br />    villan - but infact the villan is pulikesi. whereas adigal is <br />    represented as a person of great capacity - who gives up his <br />throne <br />    for his brother, then gives up his invincible cloak - his <br />venomous <br />    indistructible body ( a la karanan)to be with his lady love, <br />  finally <br />    ditches his own brother for his lady - he sacrifices everything <br />he <br />    has in his life for sivagami. </p>
<p>    mahendra pallavar - a connossieur of art, a thoughful king - <br />  careful <br />    planner and who looks at the welfare of his people even before <br />the <br />    likes of his dearest son...</p>
<p>    infact in the first half of ss, narasimha pallavar doesnt do much <br />    except for some romantice interludes with sivagami. Its <br />paranjyothi <br />    and mahendrar who move the plot.</p>
<p>    i just compared this ( style) to introducing Arulmozhi later into <br />    the story ( atleast in person)...</p></dzamroodh@></p></blockquote>

        <p>hi <br />if you have seen the movie kalangarai vilakkam ( mgr and saroja devi <br />in "pon ezhil poothathu puthu vaanil" song) or parthiban kanavu( <br />gemini and vyjyanthimala) and then read kalki's books you tend to <br />imagine the charecters the same way<br />if its the other way about you hate the movies.</p>

<p>  for argument sake - first we need to define who a hero is - hero in <br />  fiction, hero's in flims ( ok we need to sub group - english film <br />  hero ,cartoon film hero, tamil film hero, telugu film hero, <br />  malayalam film hero, bengali film hero.....) and then there are <br />  double act ( dual role), thankfully dasavartharam is not released <br />  yet.</p>
<p>  If you ask me in SS, there are many heros - Naganandhi adigal - he <br />  moves right through the book, even though you would call him the <br />  villan - but infact the villan is pulikesi. whereas adigal is <br />  represented as a person of great capacity - who gives up his throne <br />  for his brother, then gives up his invincible cloak - his venomous <br />  indistructible body ( a la karanan)to be with his lady love, <br />finally <br />  ditches his own brother for his lady - he sacrifices everything he <br />  has in his life for sivagami. </p>
<p>  mahendra pallavar - a connossieur of art, a thoughful king - <br />careful <br />  planner and who looks at the welfare of his people even before the <br />  likes of his dearest son...</p>
<p>  infact in the first half of ss, narasimha pallavar doesnt do much <br />  except for some romantice interludes with sivagami. Its paranjyothi <br />  and mahendrar who move the plot.</p>
<p>  i just compared this ( style) to introducing Arulmozhi later into <br />  the story ( atleast in person)...</p>

<p>    sorry Mr. vj i cant agree with yr statements. Ok thats yr <br />opinion. <br />    But according to me and for most of the readers Narasimma <br />pallavar <br />  in <br />    SS and Vandhiyathevan for PS are the heroes. Even kalki tells in <br />  two <br />    or three places of PS ,VT as "namadhu kadhanayagan <br />vandhiyathecan" <br />    and that is the fact and he depicts Arul moli as just the name <br />  giver <br />    of the novel PS.--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay <br />    Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@  wrote:</p>
<p>      Hi,</p>
<p>      please bear in mind that most of Kalki's works were weekly <br />  issues - <br />      meaning kalki developed the plot along the way. ( this is seen <br />  from <br />      the way the reader's attn is kept through each episode), its <br />    kalki's <br />      style to introduce his main characters along the way - while <br />the <br />      initial focus is on another character - for eg, Vandiyathevan <br />in <br />  PS <br />      (there could be healthy disc on who is the actual hero but as <br />  per <br />      tile ps is Arulmozhi), similarly in SS, the initial lime light <br />  is <br />      stolen by Paranjyothi. Further kalki wrote parthiban kanavu <br />  before <br />      ss ( even though technically pk is a sequel to ss) - further of <br />  the <br />      three ss, ps and pk - pk has the least historical <br />  backing/support - <br />      of the few real characters in pk - siruthondar is real, not <br />much <br />      kalki could do with that character once it took on thuravam. <br />    whereas <br />      is ss, kalki had the liberty to build around his early <br />militiary <br />      exploits in more depth. so in that sense for atleast a <br />  considerable <br />      portion of ss, parajyothi is the hero.</p>

<p>        to Mr. Vijayakumar <br />        I read yr mail about paranjyothi. He cannot be a hero in <br />    anyway. <br />      He s a good warrior . no doubt in that. but he is not <br />continuing <br />    his <br />      carreer as such. If u read "parthiban kanavu" which goes as a <br />      continuationn of SS we could realise this well. Great mamalla <br />      chakravarthi does his charecter as a hero even after becoming <br />  the <br />      father a young girl and guy namely kumdavai and magendran. <br />kalki <br />      poses all the heroic images on him the great narasimma pallava <br />    only. <br />      Due to their "perunthanmai " mamalla and mahendra pallava are <br />      admiring paranjyothi Ofcourse v cannot his courageous works to <br />  the <br />      kingdom as a thalapathi. But always he s a thalapathi only and <br />  he <br />      cant be a king .</p>

<p>        though kalki does use a bit of imagination in SS on the role <br />  of <br />        paranjyothi - i think they all pertain to the early part of <br />  his <br />        character ( till he and Mahendra Pallavar gang up and ambush <br />        pulikesi's men in the hill/canyon)....6 months pass and kalki <br />      immdly <br />        portrays Paranjyothiyar as a mature battle hardeded veteran <br />  and <br />        right hand of mahendra pallavar. below is an account of his <br />      heroics <br />        and later life as a saint .....</p>
<p>        chiRuththoNda nAyanAr aka paranychOdhiyAr</p>
<p>        <a href="http://www.shaivam.org/nachirut.html" title="http://www.shaivam.org/nachirut.html">http://www.shaivam.org/nachirut.html</a></p>
<p>        Burnt the lust, which could burn all the discipline, with the <br />        beautiful eye between the brows - that Lord's graceful abode <br />  is <br />        thiruchcheN^kAttaN^kudi . In that town came the man of <br />      unimaginable <br />        great deeds paranychOdhiyAr . He learnt AyurvEdam, <br />saMskR^itam <br />    and <br />        the usage of arms in a flawless way. With a matured knowledge <br />  he <br />        came to the conclusion that crown all the arts is crawling <br />  snake <br />        ornated God's feet and nurtured steadily the growing love for <br />    that <br />        comforting feet. Serving the devotees of the Deedless, he <br />      undertook <br />        the position of the head of the king's army. He won the <br />battle <br />  of <br />        vAdhApi exhibiting his splendid valiance, brilliance and <br />      knowledge. <br />        When the king was wondering about his magnificent performance <br />  the <br />        ministers told him as paranychOdhiyAr was the servant of the <br />    Three-<br />        eyed Lord there was nobody to defeat him. Hearing that he was <br />  a <br />        devotee the judicious king was afraid that he had sent a <br />  devotee <br />      to <br />        the killing battlefield. He gave him a lots of gifts and <br />      properties <br />        and requested him to serve the Lord dedicating his time for <br />  that. <br />        paranychOdhiyAr returned to his town and spent the all time <br />in <br />        serving the sha.nkara at the gaNapathIchcharam temple of the <br />    town. <br />        He got married to the girl veNkAttu n^aN^gai who stood for <br />the <br />        principles of the devotee. </p>
<p>        For the devotees of the God ornated by feather, flowers and <br />      flowing <br />        river, the devotee of thriuchcheN^kAttaN^kudi everyday used <br />to <br />      host <br />        feast and then only eat. This he followed as a ritual without <br />        failure and his hospitality was known in all the directions. <br />  He <br />        being so humble in the presence of the limitlessly famed <br />  devotees <br />      he <br />        was known as chiRuth thoNdar (small servant). While his <br />  service <br />      was <br />        continuing blissfully praying the unmeasurable feet of the <br />  Lord <br />      the <br />        couple got a child. They named him chIrALa dhEvar . To <br />  celebrate <br />      the <br />        birth of the child who arrived like the fruit of the <br />  austerities <br />      the <br />        devotee made it a grand festival for the entire town. He <br />  donated <br />        liberally to the devotees and made all the rituals with the <br />  sound <br />      of <br />        vEdas reverberating the sky. The kid was brought up with <br />  utmost <br />      care <br />        of the parents. When he was three years old they sent him to <br />  the <br />        school to learn the worth learning arts. That time the Sun <br />  that <br />      rose <br />        to drive away the illusions and enlighten the world in <br />  shaivam - <br />      the <br />        prodigy thirunyAnachampan^dhar (1) came there. Holding his <br />  soft <br />      feet <br />        on his head and heart the devotee saluted him. The saint <br />  stayed <br />    in <br />        his place for some days and he praised the honest and whole-<br />      hearted <br />        service of chiRuththoNdar in the hymn he sang there. </p>
<p>        The Lord who is independent of external enjoyment wanted to <br />        demonstrate that the great are capable of doing deeds which <br />  are <br />        terrific even to think of for others. In place of lightning <br />  like <br />        matted hair He took dark cloud like matted hair, in place of <br />  the <br />        young growing crescent - a crescent shaped stripes of Holy <br />  ash, <br />    in <br />        place of snake ear-ring - a floral ring, in place of the <br />  ornament <br />      of <br />        skulls - a shining string of white stones, in place of the <br />  fierce <br />        elephant skin cladding - cladded in clothe, obscuring the <br />  black <br />        throat, with unlimited grace in the eyes, smile in the lips, <br />      beauty <br />        throughout the body, holding up the spear, the kazal worn in <br />  the <br />        legs inviting everybody to salute that form of Mercy, the <br />  Supreme <br />        came in the form of a bhairAgi. The God who feeds the entire <br />      world, <br />        acting as if He was terribly hungry came to the devotees <br />house <br />        enquiring where it is. Only his wife was there in the house. <br />  The <br />        Lord in the form of bhairAgi asked was there the servant of <br />  Lord <br />      in <br />        the house who everyday gives food for the devotees. Realizing <br />  a <br />      sage <br />        had come the chaste thiruveNkAttun^aN^gaiyAr came out and <br />said <br />        saluting him that her husband had gone out and invited Him to <br />    come <br />        inside the house. The bhairAgi replied He would not come <br />  inside <br />      the <br />        house where a woman is alone. Immediately the humble lady <br />went <br />  to <br />        the other extreme of the house and told Him that as her <br />  husband <br />      did <br />        not find any devotee that day to host he had gone searching <br />  for <br />      one <br />        and would be really happy if he knew that a devotee had come <br />  on <br />      his <br />        own. She asked Him to sit inside the house. The Lord <br />  appreciated <br />      her <br />        that they followed in the right way the discipline of family <br />    life, <br />        but still He would not enter the house without the devotee <br />    present <br />        and would be waiting for him under a tree near the temple. </p>
<p>        To the sincere servant who came back sad unable to find any <br />      devotee, <br />        his matched wife told that a devotee from the north in the <br />  form <br />    of <br />        bhairAgi came there and was waiting near the temple tree for <br />  him. <br />        With growing eagerness he went to the bhairAgi and saluted to <br />  be <br />        asked by Him "Are you the great small servant ?". The great <br />  even <br />        though they consider themselves small would be acknowledged <br />as <br />      great <br />        only by the Truth ! The humble servant replied that he was <br />not <br />        praisable in the group of devotees but out of mercy the <br />  devotees <br />        call him so. He told it was the effect of all the good deeds <br />  he <br />        would have done, for Him to come to his house. The sage who <br />      claimed <br />        to come from the north said the food He wanted was very <br />  difficult <br />      to <br />        prepare. He wanted a life to be cooked that too a human in <br />the <br />    age <br />        not exceeding five, having no physical impairments, should be <br />  the <br />        only child for the family and the child s parents should cook <br />  it <br />        happily ! The devotee with uncomparable dedication said there <br />  is <br />        nothing in the world that is impossible to achieve for the <br />      devotees. <br />        Saluting Him he came back home. </p>
<p>        The devotee told his wife the type of food the sage asked <br />for. <br />      They <br />        decided to cook their loving young son for the devotee to <br />have <br />      food. <br />        Father went and brought the child from the school. He bathed <br />  him, <br />        cleaned his body completely. With the mother holding the <br />child <br />  s <br />        hands and legs, the child enjoying their great deed, father <br />  cut <br />      his <br />        head and did the unimaginable deed. The couple of <br />synchronized <br />        thoughts were not sad but were happy about serving the <br />  devotee. <br />        Removing the head considering it would not be good for feast <br />  the <br />        loving mother cooked the rest with other food materials. Then <br />  the <br />        superior servant invited the sage to accept the feast, <br />begging <br />        pardon for any delay he would have made in preparing the <br />  feast. <br />        Washing the Feet that kicked the death to death, they <br />  sprinkled <br />      that <br />        holy water on themselves and throughout the house. His <br />  principled <br />        wife served the rice, meat and all the food materials in a <br />  plate <br />        over a white cloth. The sage asked them whether they cooked <br />  all <br />      the <br />        parts of the child. They replied in affirmative but said that <br />  as <br />      the <br />        head would not be good for the feast they did not cook it. <br />The <br />        playful Lord said He liked that too. The worry of that <br />  wonderable <br />        couple vanished when a helper chan^dhanaththAr came forward <br />  and <br />      said <br />        that she cooked the head too thinking that it would be useful <br />    when <br />        the devotee eats, and gave that part too. </p>
<p>        Now the Lord ordered him to bring a devotee to eat with Him. <br />      chiRuth <br />        thoNdar perumAn searched but came back unable to find one. To <br />  the <br />        worrying devotee He said he himself was a good devotee and <br />  asked <br />      him <br />        to eat. When chiRuth thoNdar was about to eat from the food <br />  that <br />      his <br />        wife served similarly for him in order to make the sage <br />accept <br />    the <br />        feast, the bhairAgi stopped him asking what was his hurry <br />  while <br />    He <br />        Himself who eat once in six months had not started. He asked <br />  him <br />      to <br />        call his son. Shocked the devotee replied his son would not <br />be <br />        helpful then. But the sage refused to eat without his son <br />  being <br />        present. Highly anxious the patient devotee went outside and <br />      called <br />        out his son loudly. His caring wife also shouted calling the <br />    child <br />      s <br />        name, "Oh! my dear child, chIrALA ! come fast to make the <br />  devotee <br />        have his feast !!". Who knows the grace of God !! Their son <br />  came <br />        running as if he was returning from the school. The couple <br />      embraced <br />        him and kissed him thinking they could now be blessed by the <br />      devotee <br />        accepting their feast ! When they came inside the house they <br />  were <br />        shocked at the absence of the bhairAgi as well as the meat <br />  that <br />      was <br />        cooked. Removing all their worries, removing their bonds, <br />    removing <br />        their source of birth, the Remover of pains the Lord who <br />      disappeared <br />        appeared as the form of grace with the Daughter of Himalayas <br />  and <br />      the <br />        young beautiful son murugan on the Holy Bull. Blessing the <br />      devotee, <br />        his beloved wife and loving son the Lord, His inseparable <br />  shakti <br />      and <br />        the Son who destroyed the sUra took them giving place in <br />their <br />      feet <br />        that is ultimate the price for great deeds. Let the <br />marveylous <br />        dedication of chiRuththoNdar stay in the mind. </p>

          Hero of the Story?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>ok ok..............let me come to an end. I didnt analysed all these. I thought of only about our tamil film heroes with the qualifications of our tamil culture like "Kadal , Veeram and so on.........." in that aspect i imagine Narasimma varmar and <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym . <br />thanks <br />dzam</acronym></p>

<p>for argument sake - first we need to define who a hero is - hero in <br />fiction, hero's in flims ( ok we need to sub group - english film <br />hero ,cartoon film hero, tamil film hero, telugu film hero, <br />malayalam film hero, bengali film hero.....) and then there are <br />double act ( dual role), thankfully dasavartharam is not released <br />yet.</p>
<p>If you ask me in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym , there are many heros - Naganandhi adigal - he <br />moves right through the book, even though you would call him the <br />villan - but infact the villan is pulikesi. whereas adigal is <br />represented as a person of great capacity - who gives up his throne <br />for his brother, then gives up his invincible cloak - his venomous <br />indistructible body ( a la karanan)to be with his lady love, finally <br />ditches his own brother for his lady - he sacrifices everything he <br />has in his life for sivagami. </acronym></p>
<p>mahendra pallavar - a connossieur of art, a thoughful king - careful <br />planner and who looks at the welfare of his people even before the <br />likes of his dearest son...</p>
<p>infact in the first half of <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym , narasimha pallavar doesnt do much <br />except for some romantice interludes with sivagami. Its paranjyothi <br />and mahendrar who move the plot.</acronym></p>
<p>i just compared this ( style) to introducing Arulmozhi later into <br />the story ( atleast in person)...</p>

<blockquote><p>  sorry Mr. vj i cant agree with yr statements. Ok thats yr opinion. <br />  But according to me and for most of the readers Narasimma pallavar <br />in <br />  SS and Vandhiyathevan for PS are the heroes. Even kalki tells in <br />two <br />  or three places of PS ,VT as "namadhu kadhanayagan vandhiyathecan" <br />  and that is the fact and he depicts Arul moli as just the name <br />giver <br />  of the novel PS.--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay <br />  Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@  wrote:</p>
<p>    Hi,</p>
<p>    please bear in mind that most of Kalki's works were weekly <br />issues - <br />    meaning kalki developed the plot along the way. ( this is seen <br />from <br />    the way the reader's attn is kept through each episode), its <br />  kalki's <br />    style to introduce his main characters along the way - while the <br />    initial focus is on another character - for eg, Vandiyathevan in <br />PS <br />    (there could be healthy disc on who is the actual hero but as <br />per <br />    tile ps is Arulmozhi), similarly in SS, the initial lime light <br />is <br />    stolen by Paranjyothi. Further kalki wrote parthiban kanavu <br />before <br />    ss ( even though technically pk is a sequel to ss) - further of <br />the <br />    three ss, ps and pk - pk has the least historical <br />backing/support - <br />    of the few real characters in pk - siruthondar is real, not much <br />    kalki could do with that character once it took on thuravam. <br />  whereas <br />    is ss, kalki had the liberty to build around his early militiary <br />    exploits in more depth. so in that sense for atleast a <br />considerable <br />    portion of ss, parajyothi is the hero.</p>

<p>      to Mr. Vijayakumar <br />      I read yr mail about paranjyothi. He cannot be a hero in <br />  anyway. <br />    He s a good warrior . no doubt in that. but he is not continuing <br />  his <br />    carreer as such. If u read "parthiban kanavu" which goes as a <br />    continuationn of SS we could realise this well. Great mamalla <br />    chakravarthi does his charecter as a hero even after becoming <br />the <br />    father a young girl and guy namely kumdavai and magendran. kalki <br />    poses all the heroic images on him the great narasimma pallava <br />  only. <br />    Due to their "perunthanmai " mamalla and mahendra pallava are <br />    admiring paranjyothi Ofcourse v cannot his courageous works to <br />the <br />    kingdom as a thalapathi.

<p>      though kalki does use a bit of imagination in SS on the role <br />of <br />      paranjyothi - i think they all pertain to the early part of <br />his <br />      character ( till he and Mahendra Pallavar gang up and ambush <br />      pulikesi's men in the hill/canyon)....6 months pass and kalki <br />    immdly <br />      portrays Paranjyothiyar as a mature battle hardeded veteran <br />and <br />      right hand of mahendra pallavar. below is an account of his <br />    heroics <br />      and later life as a saint .....</p>
<p>      chiRuththoNda nAyanAr aka paranychOdhiyAr</p>
<p>      <a href="http://www.shaivam.org/nachirut.html" title="http://www.shaivam.org/nachirut.html">http://www.shaivam.org/nachirut.html</a></p>
<p>      Burnt the lust, which could burn all the discipline, with the <br />      beautiful eye between the brows - that Lord's graceful abode <br />is <br />      thiruchcheN^kAttaN^kudi . In that town came the man of <br />    unimaginable <br />      great deeds paranychOdhiyAr . He learnt AyurvEdam, saMskR^itam <br />  and <br />      the usage of arms in a flawless way. With a matured knowledge <br />he <br />      came to the conclusion that crown all the arts is crawling <br />snake <br />      ornated God's feet and nurtured steadily the growing love for <br />  that <br />      comforting feet. Serving the devotees of the Deedless, he <br />    undertook <br />      the position of the head of the king's army. He won the battle <br />of <br />      vAdhApi exhibiting his splendid valiance, brilliance and <br />    knowledge. <br />      When the king was wondering about his magnificent performance <br />the <br />      ministers told him as paranychOdhiyAr was the servant of the <br />  Three-<br />      eyed Lord there was nobody to defeat him. Hearing that he was <br />a <br />      devotee the judicious king was afraid that he had sent a <br />devotee <br />    to <br />      the killing battlefield. He gave him a lots of gifts and <br />    properties <br />      and requested him to serve the Lord dedicating his time for <br />that. <br />      paranychOdhiyAr returned to his town and spent the all time in <br />      serving the sha.nkara at the gaNapathIchcharam temple of the <br />  town. <br />      He got married to the girl veNkAttu n^aN^gai who stood for the <br />      principles of the devotee. </p>
<p>      For the devotees of the God ornated by feather, flowers and <br />    flowing <br />      river, the devotee of thriuchcheN^kAttaN^kudi everyday used to <br />    host <br />      feast and then only eat. This he followed as a ritual without <br />      failure and his hospitality was known in all the directions. <br />He <br />      being so humble in the presence of the limitlessly famed <br />devotees <br />    he <br />      was known as chiRuth thoNdar (small servant). While his <br />service <br />    was <br />      continuing blissfully praying the unmeasurable feet of the <br />Lord <br />    the <br />      couple got a child. They named him chIrALa dhEvar . To <br />celebrate <br />    the <br />      birth of the child who arrived like the fruit of the <br />austerities <br />    the <br />      devotee made it a grand festival for the entire town. He <br />donated <br />      liberally to the devotees and made all the rituals with the <br />sound <br />    of <br />      vEdas reverberating the sky. The kid was brought up with <br />utmost <br />    care <br />      of the parents. When he was three years old they sent him to <br />the <br />      school to learn the worth learning arts. That time the Sun <br />that <br />    rose <br />      to drive away the illusions and enlighten the world in <br />shaivam - <br />    the <br />      prodigy thirunyAnachampan^dhar (1) came there. Holding his <br />soft <br />    feet <br />      on his head and heart the devotee saluted him. The saint <br />stayed <br />  in <br />      his place for some days and he praised the honest and whole-<br />    hearted <br />      service of chiRuththoNdar in the hymn he sang there. </p>
<p>      The Lord who is independent of external enjoyment wanted to <br />      demonstrate that the great are capable of doing deeds which <br />are <br />      terrific even to think of for others. In place of lightning <br />like <br />      matted hair He took dark cloud like matted hair, in place of <br />the <br />      young growing crescent - a crescent shaped stripes of Holy <br />ash, <br />  in <br />      place of snake ear-ring - a floral ring, in place of the <br />ornament <br />    of <br />      skulls - a shining string of white stones, in place of the <br />fierce <br />      elephant skin cladding - cladded in clothe, obscuring the <br />black <br />      throat, with unlimited grace in the eyes, smile in the lips, <br />    beauty <br />      throughout the body, holding up the spear, the kazal worn in <br />the <br />      legs inviting everybody to salute that form of Mercy, the <br />Supreme <br />      came in the form of a bhairAgi. The God who feeds the entire <br />    world, <br />      acting as if He was terribly hungry came to the devotees house <br />      enquiring where it is. Only his wife was there in the house. <br />The <br />      Lord in the form of bhairAgi asked was there the servant of <br />Lord <br />    in <br />      the house who everyday gives food for the devotees. Realizing <br />a <br />    sage <br />      had come the chaste thiruveNkAttun^aN^gaiyAr came out and said <br />      saluting him that her husband had gone out and invited Him to <br />  come <br />      inside the house. The bhairAgi replied He would not come <br />inside <br />    the <br />      house where a woman is alone. Immediately the humble lady went <br />to <br />      the other extreme of the house and told Him that as her <br />husband <br />    did <br />      not find any devotee that day to host he had gone searching <br />for <br />    one <br />      and would be really happy if he knew that a devotee had come <br />on <br />    his <br />      own. She asked Him to sit inside the house. The Lord <br />appreciated <br />    her <br />      that they followed in the right way the discipline of family <br />  life, <br />      but still He would not enter the house without the devotee <br />  present <br />      and would be waiting for him under a tree near the temple. </p>
<p>      To the sincere servant who came back sad unable to find any <br />    devotee, <br />      his matched wife told that a devotee from the north in the <br />form <br />  of <br />      bhairAgi came there and was waiting near the temple tree for <br />him. <br />      With growing eagerness he went to the bhairAgi and saluted to <br />be <br />      asked by Him "Are you the great small servant ?". The great <br />even <br />      though they consider themselves small would be acknowledged as <br />    great <br />      only by the Truth ! The humble servant replied that he was not <br />      praisable in the group of devotees but out of mercy the <br />devotees <br />      call him so. He told it was the effect of all the good deeds <br />he <br />      would have done, for Him to come to his house. The sage who <br />    claimed <br />      to come from the north said the food He wanted was very <br />difficult <br />    to <br />      prepare. He wanted a life to be cooked that too a human in the <br />  age <br />      not exceeding five, having no physical impairments, should be <br />the <br />      only child for the family and the child s parents should cook <br />it <br />      happily ! The devotee with uncomparable dedication said there <br />is <br />      nothing in the world that is impossible to achieve for the <br />    devotees. <br />      Saluting Him he came back home. </p>
<p>      The devotee told his wife the type of food the sage asked for. <br />    They <br />      decided to cook their loving young son for the devotee to have <br />    food. <br />      Father went and brought the child from the school. He bathed <br />him, <br />      cleaned his body completely. With the mother holding the child <br />s <br />      hands and legs, the child enjoying their great deed, father <br />cut <br />    his <br />      head and did the unimaginable deed. The couple of synchronized <br />      thoughts were not sad but were happy about serving the <br />devotee. <br />      Removing the head considering it would not be good for feast <br />the <br />      loving mother cooked the rest with other food materials. Then <br />the <br />      superior servant invited the sage to accept the feast, begging <br />      pardon for any delay he would have made in preparing the <br />feast. <br />      Washing the Feet that kicked the death to death, they <br />sprinkled <br />    that <br />      holy water on themselves and throughout the house. His <br />principled <br />      wife served the rice, meat and all the food materials in a <br />plate <br />      over a white cloth. The sage asked them whether they cooked <br />all <br />    the <br />      parts of the child. They replied in affirmative but said that <br />as <br />    the <br />      head would not be good for the feast they did not cook it. The <br />      playful Lord said He liked that too. The worry of that <br />wonderable <br />      couple vanished when a helper chan^dhanaththAr came forward <br />and <br />    said <br />      that she cooked the head too thinking that it would be useful <br />  when <br />      the devotee eats, and gave that part too. </p>
<p>      Now the Lord ordered him to bring a devotee to eat with Him. <br />    chiRuth <br />      thoNdar perumAn searched but came back unable to find one. To <br />the <br />      worrying devotee He said he himself was a good devotee and <br />asked <br />    him <br />      to eat. When chiRuth thoNdar was about to eat from the food <br />that <br />    his <br />      wife served similarly for him in order to make the sage accept <br />  the <br />      feast, the bhairAgi stopped him asking what was his hurry <br />while <br />  He <br />      Himself who eat once in six months had not started. He asked <br />him <br />    to <br />      call his son. Shocked the devotee replied his son would not be <br />      helpful then. But the sage refused to eat without his son <br />being <br />      present. Highly anxious the patient devotee went outside and <br />    called <br />      out his son loudly. His caring wife also shouted calling the <br />  child <br />    s <br />      name, "Oh! my dear child, chIrALA ! come fast to make the <br />devotee <br />      have his feast !!". Who knows the grace of God !! Their son <br />came <br />      running as if he was returning from the school. The couple <br />    embraced <br />      him and kissed him thinking they could now be blessed by the <br />    devotee <br />      accepting their feast ! When they came inside the house they <br />were <br />      shocked at the absence of the bhairAgi as well as the meat <br />that <br />    was <br />      cooked. Removing all their worries, removing their bonds, <br />  removing <br />      their source of birth, the Remover of pains the Lord who <br />    disappeared <br />      appeared as the form of grace with the Daughter of Himalayas <br />and <br />    the <br />      young beautiful son murugan on the Holy Bull. Blessing the <br />    devotee, <br />      his beloved wife and loving son the Lord, His inseparable <br />shakti <br />    and <br />      the Son who destroyed the sUra took them giving place in their <br />    feet <br />      that is ultimate the price for great deeds. Let the marveylous <br />      dedication of chiRuththoNdar stay in the mind. </p>

          Hero of the Story?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>That the beauty with kalki's works, we can argue for ever ( there is <br />never a need to agree in an argument of this kind...)</p>
<p>for argument sake - first we need to define who a hero is - hero in <br />fiction, hero's in flims ( ok we need to sub group - english film <br />hero ,cartoon film hero, tamil film hero, telugu film hero, <br />malayalam film hero, bengali film hero.....) and then there are <br />double act ( dual role), thankfully dasavartharam is not released <br />yet.</p>
<p>If you ask me in <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym , there are many heros - Naganandhi adigal - he <br />moves right through the book, even though you would call him the <br />villan - but infact the villan is pulikesi. whereas adigal is <br />represented as a person of great capacity - who gives up his throne <br />for his brother, then gives up his invincible cloak - his venomous <br />indistructible body ( a la karanan)to be with his lady love, finally <br />ditches his own brother for his lady - he sacrifices everything he <br />has in his life for sivagami. </acronym></p>
<p>mahendra pallavar - a connossieur of art, a thoughful king - careful <br />planner and who looks at the welfare of his people even before the <br />likes of his dearest son...</p>
<p>infact in the first half of <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym , narasimha pallavar doesnt do much <br />except for some romantice interludes with sivagami. Its paranjyothi <br />and mahendrar who move the plot.</acronym></p>
<p>i just compared this ( style) to introducing Arulmozhi later into <br />the story ( atleast in person)...</p>

<blockquote><p>  sorry Mr. vj i cant agree with yr statements. Ok thats yr opinion. <br />  But according to me and for most of the readers Narasimma pallavar <br />in <br />  SS and Vandhiyathevan for PS are the heroes. Even kalki tells in <br />two <br />  or three places of PS ,VT as "namadhu kadhanayagan vandhiyathecan" <br />  and that is the fact and he depicts Arul moli as just the name <br />giver <br />  of the novel PS.--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay <br />  Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@  wrote:</p>
<p>    Hi,</p>
<p>    please bear in mind that most of Kalki's works were weekly <br />issues - <br />    meaning kalki developed the plot along the way. ( this is seen <br />from <br />    the way the reader's attn is kept through each episode), its <br />  kalki's <br />    style to introduce his main characters along the way - while the <br />    initial focus is on another character - for eg, Vandiyathevan in <br />PS <br />    (there could be healthy disc on who is the actual hero but as <br />per <br />    tile ps is Arulmozhi), similarly in SS, the initial lime light <br />is <br />    stolen by Paranjyothi. Further kalki wrote parthiban kanavu <br />before <br />    ss ( even though technically pk is a sequel to ss) - further of <br />the <br />    three ss, ps and pk - pk has the least historical <br />backing/support - <br />    of the few real characters in pk - siruthondar is real, not much <br />    kalki could do with that character once it took on thuravam. <br />  whereas <br />    is ss, kalki had the liberty to build around his early militiary <br />    exploits in more depth. so in that sense for atleast a <br />considerable <br />    portion of ss, parajyothi is the hero.</p>

<p>      to Mr. Vijayakumar <br />      I read yr mail about paranjyothi. He cannot be a hero in <br />  anyway. <br />    He s a good warrior . no doubt in that. but he is not continuing <br />  his <br />    carreer as such. If u read "parthiban kanavu" which goes as a <br />    continuationn of SS we could realise this well. Great mamalla <br />    chakravarthi does his charecter as a hero even after becoming <br />the <br />    father a young girl and guy namely kumdavai and magendran. kalki <br />    poses all the heroic images on him the great narasimma pallava <br />  only. <br />    Due to their "perunthanmai " mamalla and mahendra pallava are <br />    admiring paranjyothi Ofcourse v cannot his courageous works to <br />the <br />    kingdom as a thalapathi. But always he s a thalapathi only and <br />he <br />    cant be a king .</p>

<p>      though kalki does use a bit of imagination in SS on the role <br />of <br />      paranjyothi - i think they all pertain to the early part of <br />his <br />      character ( till he and Mahendra Pallavar gang up and ambush <br />      pulikesi's men in the hill/canyon)....6 months pass and kalki <br />    immdly <br />      portrays Paranjyothiyar as a mature battle hardeded veteran <br />and <br />      right hand of mahendra pallavar. below is an account of his <br />    heroics <br />      and later life as a saint .....</p>
<p>      chiRuththoNda nAyanAr aka paranychOdhiyAr</p>
<p>      <a href="http://www.shaivam.org/nachirut.html" title="http://www.shaivam.org/nachirut.html">http://www.shaivam.org/nachirut.html</a></p>
<p>      Burnt the lust, which could burn all the discipline, with the <br />      beautiful eye between the brows - that Lord's graceful abode <br />is <br />      thiruchcheN^kAttaN^kudi . In that town came the man of <br />    unimaginable <br />      great deeds paranychOdhiyAr . He learnt AyurvEdam, saMskR^itam <br />  and <br />      the usage of arms in a flawless way. With a matured knowledge <br />he <br />      came to the conclusion that crown all the arts is crawling <br />snake <br />      ornated God's feet and nurtured steadily the growing love for <br />  that <br />      comforting feet. Serving the devotees of the Deedless, he <br />    undertook <br />      the position of the head of the king's army. He won the battle <br />of <br />      vAdhApi exhibiting his splendid valiance, brilliance and <br />    knowledge. <br />      When the king was wondering about his magnificent performance <br />the <br />      ministers told him as paranychOdhiyAr was the servant of the <br />  Three-<br />      eyed Lord there was nobody to defeat him. Hearing that he was <br />a <br />      devotee the judicious king was afraid that he had sent a <br />devotee <br />    to <br />      the killing battlefield. He gave him a lots of gifts and <br />    properties <br />      and requested him to serve the Lord dedicating his time for <br />that. <br />      paranychOdhiyAr returned to his town and spent the all time in <br />      serving the sha.nkara at the gaNapathIchcharam temple of the <br />  town. <br />      He got married to the girl veNkAttu n^aN^gai who stood for the <br />      principles of the devotee. </p>
<p>      For the devotees of the God ornated by feather, flowers and <br />    flowing <br />      river, the devotee of thriuchcheN^kAttaN^kudi everyday used to <br />    host <br />      feast and then only eat. This he followed as a ritual without <br />      failure and his hospitality was known in all the directions. <br />He <br />      being so humble in the presence of the limitlessly famed <br />devotees <br />    he <br />      was known as chiRuth thoNdar (small servant). While his <br />service <br />    was <br />      continuing blissfully praying the unmeasurable feet of the <br />Lord <br />    the <br />      couple got a child. They named him chIrALa dhEvar . To <br />celebrate <br />    the <br />      birth of the child who arrived like the fruit of the <br />austerities <br />    the <br />      devotee made it a grand festival for the entire town. He <br />donated <br />      liberally to the devotees and made all the rituals with the <br />sound <br />    of <br />      vEdas reverberating the sky. The kid was brought up with <br />utmost <br />    care <br />      of the parents. When he was three years old they sent him to <br />the <br />      school to learn the worth learning arts. That time the Sun <br />that <br />    rose <br />      to drive away the illusions and enlighten the world in <br />shaivam - <br />    the <br />      prodigy thirunyAnachampan^dhar (1) came there. Holding his <br />soft <br />    feet <br />      on his head and heart the devotee saluted him. The saint <br />stayed <br />  in <br />      his place for some days and he praised the honest and whole-<br />    hearted <br />      service of chiRuththoNdar in the hymn he sang there. </p>
<p>      The Lord who is independent of external enjoyment wanted to <br />      demonstrate that the great are capable of doing deeds which <br />are <br />      terrific even to think of for others. In place of lightning <br />like <br />      matted hair He took dark cloud like matted hair, in place of <br />the <br />      young growing crescent - a crescent shaped stripes of Holy <br />ash, <br />  in <br />      place of snake ear-ring - a floral ring, in place of the <br />ornament <br />    of <br />      skulls - a shining string of white stones, in place of the <br />fierce <br />      elephant skin cladding - cladded in clothe, obscuring the <br />black <br />      throat, with unlimited grace in the eyes, smile in the lips, <br />    beauty <br />      throughout the body, holding up the spear, the kazal worn in <br />the <br />      legs inviting everybody to salute that form of Mercy, the <br />Supreme <br />      came in the form of a bhairAgi. The God who feeds the entire <br />    world, <br />      acting as if He was terribly hungry came to the devotees house <br />      enquiring where it is. Only his wife was there in the house. <br />The <br />      Lord in the form of bhairAgi asked was there the servant of <br />Lord <br />    in <br />      the house who everyday gives food for the devotees. Realizing <br />a <br />    sage <br />      had come the chaste thiruveNkAttun^aN^gaiyAr came out and said <br />      saluting him that her husband had gone out and invited Him to <br />  come <br />      inside the house. The bhairAgi replied He would not come <br />inside <br />    the <br />      house where a woman is alone. Immediately the humble lady went <br />to <br />      the other extreme of the house and told Him that as her <br />husband <br />    did <br />      not find any devotee that day to host he had gone searching <br />for <br />    one <br />      and would be really happy if he knew that a devotee had come <br />on <br />    his <br />      own. She asked Him to sit inside the house. The Lord <br />appreciated <br />    her <br />      that they followed in the right way the discipline of family <br />  life, <br />      but still He would not enter the house without the devotee <br />  present <br />      and would be waiting for him under a tree near the temple. </p>
<p>      To the sincere servant who came back sad unable to find any <br />    devotee, <br />      his matched wife told that a devotee from the north in the <br />form <br />  of <br />      bhairAgi came there and was waiting near the temple tree for <br />him. <br />      With growing eagerness he went to the bhairAgi and saluted to <br />be <br />      asked by Him "Are you the great small servant ?". The great <br />even <br />      though they consider themselves small would be acknowledged as <br />    great <br />      only by the Truth ! The humble servant replied that he was not <br />      praisable in the group of devotees but out of mercy the <br />devotees <br />      call him so. He told it was the effect of all the good deeds <br />he <br />      would have done, for Him to come to his house. The sage who <br />    claimed <br />      to come from the north said the food He wanted was very <br />difficult <br />    to <br />      prepare. He wanted a life to be cooked that too a human in the <br />  age <br />      not exceeding five, having no physical impairments, should be <br />the <br />      only child for the family and the child s parents should cook <br />it <br />      happily ! The devotee with uncomparable dedication said there <br />is <br />      nothing in the world that is impossible to achieve for the <br />    devotees. <br />      Saluting Him he came back home. </p>
<p>      The devotee told his wife the type of food the sage asked for. <br />    They <br />      decided to cook their loving young son for the devotee to have <br />    food. <br />      Father went and brought the child from the school. He bathed <br />him, <br />      cleaned his body completely. With the mother holding the child <br />s <br />      hands and legs, the child enjoying their great deed, father <br />cut <br />    his <br />      head and did the unimaginable deed. The couple of synchronized <br />      thoughts were not sad but were happy about serving the <br />devotee. <br />      Removing the head considering it would not be good for feast <br />the <br />      loving mother cooked the rest with other food materials. Then <br />the <br />      superior servant invited the sage to accept the feast, begging <br />      pardon for any delay he would have made in preparing the <br />feast. <br />      Washing the Feet that kicked the death to death, they <br />sprinkled <br />    that <br />      holy water on themselves and throughout the house. His <br />principled <br />      wife served the rice, meat and all the food materials in a <br />plate <br />      over a white cloth. The sage asked them whether they cooked <br />all <br />    the <br />      parts of the child. They replied in affirmative but said that <br />as <br />    the <br />      head would not be good for the feast they did not cook it. The <br />      playful Lord said He liked that too. The worry of that <br />wonderable <br />      couple vanished when a helper chan^dhanaththAr came forward <br />and <br />    said <br />      that she cooked the head too thinking that it would be useful <br />  when <br />      the devotee eats, and gave that part too. </p>
<p>      Now the Lord ordered him to bring a devotee to eat with Him. <br />    chiRuth <br />      thoNdar perumAn searched but came back unable to find one. To <br />the <br />      worrying devotee He said he himself was a good devotee and <br />asked <br />    him <br />      to eat. When chiRuth thoNdar was about to eat from the food <br />that <br />    his <br />      wife served similarly for him in order to make the sage accept <br />  the <br />      feast, the bhairAgi stopped him asking what was his hurry <br />while <br />  He <br />      Himself who eat once in six months had not started. He asked <br />him <br />    to <br />      call his son. Shocked the devotee replied his son would not be <br />      helpful then. But the sage refused to eat without his son <br />being <br />      present. Highly anxious the patient devotee went outside and <br />    called <br />      out his son loudly. His caring wife also shouted calling the <br />  child <br />    s <br />      name, "Oh! my dear child, chIrALA ! come fast to make the <br />devotee <br />      have his feast !!". Who knows the grace of God !! Their son <br />came <br />      running as if he was returning from the school. The couple <br />    embraced <br />      him and kissed him thinking they could now be blessed by the <br />    devotee <br />      accepting their feast ! When they came inside the house they <br />were <br />      shocked at the absence of the bhairAgi as well as the meat <br />that <br />    was <br />      cooked. Removing all their worries, removing their bonds, <br />  removing <br />      their source of birth, the Remover of pains the Lord who <br />    disappeared <br />      appeared as the form of grace with the Daughter of Himalayas <br />and <br />    the <br />      young beautiful son murugan on the Holy Bull. Blessing the <br />    devotee, <br />      his beloved wife and loving son the Lord, His inseparable <br />shakti <br />    and <br />      the Son who destroyed the sUra took them giving place in their <br />    feet <br />      that is ultimate the price for great deeds. Let the marveylous <br />      dedication of chiRuththoNdar stay in the mind. </p>

<p>        I saw that there was a signigicant discussion of who <br />actually <br />    was <br />      the hero Vandhiyadevan or arulmozhi....It was very interesting <br />to <br />      see all your veiws about kalki trying to sideline VD and his <br />      personality and popularity making him immortal...lets face it <br />If <br />    he <br />      has made a charecter being analysed after so many decades of <br />his <br />      creation is the author's victory....</p>
<p>        But the fact of the matter is most historic novels use <br />    charectors <br />      in the sideline as major players because you can use them with <br />a <br />    bit <br />      of Creator's imagination and liberty as opposed to certified <br />    figures <br />      of history..</p>
<p>        Eg Paranchothi in Sivagamiyin sabatham though the main <br />  charector <br />      is Narasimha pallava.</p>
<p>        Parthiban Kanavu...Parthiban though the main Hero is <br />Mahindra <br />      varma Palava</p>
<p>        Vanthiyadevan in PS</p>
<p>        Ilango in Vengaiin mainthan(Akilan)..though the main <br />charector <br />    is <br />      Rajendra Chola and his victories</p>
<p>        Ilayapallavan in KadalPura (Sandilyan)...which was set in <br />the <br />      later period of cholas During the Kalingathu parani era <br />featuring <br />      Abaya Kulothunga</p>
<p>        Ilanchelian in Yavanarani.(Sandilyan)set during the <br />ascension <br />  of <br />      Karikalan of sangam period</p>
<p>        It just enables the authors to mix facts with fiction and <br />give <br />    us <br />      a blend.For Historic novel buff Kadakpura and Yavanarani are a <br />    must <br />      read...</p>

          Hero of the Story?        </div>

        <p>sorry Mr. vj i cant agree with yr statements. Ok thats yr opinion. <br />But according to me and for most of the readers Narasimma pallavar in <br /><acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  and Vandhiyathevan for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  are the heroes. Even kalki tells in two <br />or three places of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  ,<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  as "namadhu kadhanayagan vandhiyathecan" <br />and that is the fact and he depicts Arul moli as just the name giver <br />of the novel <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com, "Vijay <br />Kumar .S" <vj_episteme@...  wrote:</p>

Further kalki wrote parthiban kanavu before <br />  ss ( even though technically pk is a sequel to ss) - further of the <br />  three ss, ps and pk - pk has the least historical backing/support - <br />  of the few real characters in pk - siruthondar is real, not much <br />  kalki could do with that character once it took on thuravam. <br />whereas <br />  is ss, kalki had the liberty to build around his early militiary <br />  exploits in more depth. so in that sense for atleast a considerable <br />  portion of ss, parajyothi is the hero.</p>

<p>    Burnt the lust, which could burn all the discipline, with the <br />    beautiful eye between the brows - that Lord's graceful abode is <br />    thiruchcheN^kAttaN^kudi . In that town came the man of <br />  unimaginable <br />    great deeds paranychOdhiyAr . He learnt AyurvEdam, saMskR^itam <br />and <br />    the usage of arms in a flawless way. With a matured knowledge he <br />    came to the conclusion that crown all the arts is crawling snake <br />    ornated God's feet and nurtured steadily the growing love for <br />that <br />    comforting feet. Serving the devotees of the Deedless, he <br />  undertook <br />    the position of the head of the king's army. He won the battle of <br />    vAdhApi exhibiting his splendid valiance, brilliance and <br />  knowledge. <br />    When the king was wondering about his magnificent performance the <br />    ministers told him as paranychOdhiyAr was the servant of the <br />Three-<br />    eyed Lord there was nobody to defeat him. Hearing that he was a <br />    devotee the judicious king was afraid that he had sent a devotee <br />  to <br />    the killing battlefield. He gave him a lots of gifts and <br />  properties <br />    and requested him to serve the Lord dedicating his time for that. <br />    paranychOdhiyAr returned to his town and spent the all time in <br />    serving the sha.nkara at the gaNapathIchcharam temple of the <br />town. <br />    He got married to the girl veNkAttu n^aN^gai who stood for the <br />    principles of the devotee. </p>
<p>    For the devotees of the God ornated by feather, flowers and <br />  flowing <br />    river, the devotee of thriuchcheN^kAttaN^kudi everyday used to <br />  host <br />    feast and then only eat. This he followed as a ritual without <br />    failure and his hospitality was known in all the directions. He <br />    being so humble in the presence of the limitlessly famed devotees <br />  he <br />    was known as chiRuth thoNdar (small servant). While his service <br />  was <br />    continuing blissfully praying the unmeasurable feet of the Lord <br />  the <br />    couple got a child. They named him chIrALa dhEvar . To celebrate <br />  the <br />    birth of the child who arrived like the fruit of the austerities <br />  the <br />    devotee made it a grand festival for the entire town. He donated <br />    liberally to the devotees and made all the rituals with the sound <br />  of <br />    vEdas reverberating the sky. The kid was brought up with utmost <br />  care <br />    of the parents. When he was three years old they sent him to the <br />    school to learn the worth learning arts. That time the Sun that <br />  rose <br />    to drive away the illusions and enlighten the world in shaivam - <br />  the <br />    prodigy thirunyAnachampan^dhar (1) came there. Holding his soft <br />  feet <br />    on his head and heart the devotee saluted him. The saint stayed <br />in <br />    his place for some days and he praised the honest and whole-<br />  hearted <br />    service of chiRuththoNdar in the hymn he sang there. </p>
<p>    The Lord who is independent of external enjoyment wanted to <br />    demonstrate that the great are capable of doing deeds which are <br />    terrific even to think of for others. In place of lightning like <br />    matted hair He took dark cloud like matted hair, in place of the <br />    young growing crescent - a crescent shaped stripes of Holy ash, <br />in <br />    place of snake ear-ring - a floral ring, in place of the ornament <br />  of <br />    skulls - a shining string of white stones, in place of the fierce <br />    elephant skin cladding - cladded in clothe, obscuring the black <br />    throat, with unlimited grace in the eyes, smile in the lips, <br />  beauty <br />    throughout the body, holding up the spear, the kazal worn in the <br />    legs inviting everybody to salute that form of Mercy, the Supreme <br />    came in the form of a bhairAgi. The God who feeds the entire <br />  world, <br />    acting as if He was terribly hungry came to the devotees house <br />    enquiring where it is. Only his wife was there in the house. The <br />    Lord in the form of bhairAgi asked was there the servant of Lord <br />  in <br />    the house who everyday gives food for the devotees. Realizing a <br />  sage <br />    had come the chaste thiruveNkAttun^aN^gaiyAr came out and said <br />    saluting him that her husband had gone out and invited Him to <br />come <br />    inside the house. The bhairAgi replied He would not come inside <br />  the <br />    house where a woman is alone. Immediately the humble lady went to <br />    the other extreme of the house and told Him that as her husband <br />  did <br />    not find any devotee that day to host he had gone searching for <br />  one <br />    and would be really happy if he knew that a devotee had come on <br />  his <br />    own. She asked Him to sit inside the house. The Lord appreciated <br />  her <br />    that they followed in the right way the discipline of family <br />life, <br />    but still He would not enter the house without the devotee <br />present <br />    and would be waiting for him under a tree near the temple. </p>
<p>    To the sincere servant who came back sad unable to find any <br />  devotee, <br />    his matched wife told that a devotee from the north in the form <br />of <br />    bhairAgi came there and was waiting near the temple tree for him. <br />    With growing eagerness he went to the bhairAgi and saluted to be <br />    asked by Him "Are you the great small servant ?". The great even <br />    though they consider themselves small would be acknowledged as <br />  great <br />    only by the Truth ! The humble servant replied that he was not <br />    praisable in the group of devotees but out of mercy the devotees <br />    call him so. He told it was the effect of all the good deeds he <br />    would have done, for Him to come to his house. The sage who <br />  claimed <br />    to come from the north said the food He wanted was very difficult <br />  to <br />    prepare. He wanted a life to be cooked that too a human in the <br />age <br />    not exceeding five, having no physical impairments, should be the <br />    only child for the family and the child s parents should cook it <br />    happily ! The devotee with uncomparable dedication said there is <br />    nothing in the world that is impossible to achieve for the <br />  devotees. <br />    Saluting Him he came back home. </p>
<p>    The devotee told his wife the type of food the sage asked for. <br />  They <br />    decided to cook their loving young son for the devotee to have <br />  food. <br />    Father went and brought the child from the school. He bathed him, <br />    cleaned his body completely. With the mother holding the child s <br />    hands and legs, the child enjoying their great deed, father cut <br />  his <br />    head and did the unimaginable deed. The couple of synchronized <br />    thoughts were not sad but were happy about serving the devotee. <br />    Removing the head considering it would not be good for feast the <br />    loving mother cooked the rest with other food materials. Then the <br />    superior servant invited the sage to accept the feast, begging <br />    pardon for any delay he would have made in preparing the feast. <br />    Washing the Feet that kicked the death to death, they sprinkled <br />  that <br />    holy water on themselves and throughout the house. His principled <br />    wife served the rice, meat and all the food materials in a plate <br />    over a white cloth. The sage asked them whether they cooked all <br />  the <br />    parts of the child. They replied in affirmative but said that as <br />  the <br />    head would not be good for the feast they did not cook it. The <br />    playful Lord said He liked that too. The worry of that wonderable <br />    couple vanished when a helper chan^dhanaththAr came forward and <br />  said <br />    that she cooked the head too thinking that it would be useful <br />when <br />    the devotee eats, and gave that part too. </p>
<p>    Now the Lord ordered him to bring a devotee to eat with Him. <br />  chiRuth <br />    thoNdar perumAn searched but came back unable to find one. To the <br />    worrying devotee He said he himself was a good devotee and asked <br />  him <br />    to eat. When chiRuth thoNdar was about to eat from the food that <br />  his <br />    wife served similarly for him in order to make the sage accept <br />the <br />    feast, the bhairAgi stopped him asking what was his hurry while <br />He <br />    Himself who eat once in six months had not started. He asked him <br />  to <br />    call his son. Shocked the devotee replied his son would not be <br />    helpful then. But the sage refused to eat without his son being <br />    present. Highly anxious the patient devotee went outside and <br />  called <br />    out his son loudly. His caring wife also shouted calling the <br />child <br />  s <br />    name, "Oh! my dear child, chIrALA ! come fast to make the devotee <br />    have his feast !!". Who knows the grace of God !! Their son came <br />    running as if he was returning from the school. The couple <br />  embraced <br />    him and kissed him thinking they could now be blessed by the <br />  devotee <br />    accepting their feast ! When they came inside the house they were <br />    shocked at the absence of the bhairAgi as well as the meat that <br />  was <br />    cooked. Removing all their worries, removing their bonds, <br />removing <br />    their source of birth, the Remover of pains the Lord who <br />  disappeared <br />    appeared as the form of grace with the Daughter of Himalayas and <br />  the <br />    young beautiful son murugan on the Holy Bull. Blessing the <br />  devotee, <br />    his beloved wife and loving son the Lord, His inseparable shakti <br />  and <br />    the Son who destroyed the sUra took them giving place in their <br />  feet <br />    that is ultimate the price for great deeds. Let the marveylous <br />    dedication of chiRuththoNdar stay in the mind. </p>

<p>      I saw that there was a signigicant discussion of who actually <br />  was <br />    the hero Vandhiyadevan or arulmozhi....It was very interesting to <br />    see all your veiws about kalki trying to sideline VD and his <br />    personality and popularity making him immortal...lets face it If <br />  he <br />    has made a charecter being analysed after so many decades of his <br />    creation is the author's victory....</p>
<p>      But the fact of the matter is most historic novels use <br />  charectors <br />    in the sideline as major players because you can use them with a <br />  bit <br />    of Creator's imagination and liberty as opposed to certified <br />  figures <br />    of history..</p>
<p>      Eg Paranchothi in Sivagamiyin sabatham though the main <br />charector <br />    is Narasimha pallava.</p>
<p>      Parthiban Kanavu...Parthiban though the main Hero is Mahindra <br />    varma Palava</p>
<p>      Vanthiyadevan in PS</p>
<p>      Ilango in Vengaiin mainthan(Akilan)..though the main charector <br />  is <br />    Rajendra Chola and his victories</p>
<p>      Ilayapallavan in KadalPura (Sandilyan)...which was set in the <br />    later period of cholas During the Kalingathu parani era featuring <br />    Abaya Kulothunga</p>
<p>      Ilanchelian in Yavanarani.(Sandilyan)set during the ascension <br />of <br />    Karikalan of sangam period</p>
<p>      It just enables the authors to mix facts with fiction and give <br />  us <br />    a blend.For Historic novel buff Kadakpura and Yavanarani are a <br />  must <br />    read...</p>

Hearing that he was a <br />  devotee the judicious king was afraid that he had sent a devotee <br />to <br />  the killing battlefield. He gave him a lots of gifts and <br />properties <br />  and requested him to serve the Lord dedicating his time for that. <br />  paranychOdhiyAr returned to his town and spent the all time in <br />  serving the sha.nkara at the gaNapathIchcharam temple of the town. <br />  He got married to the girl veNkAttu n^aN^gai who stood for the <br />  principles of the devotee. </p>
<p>  For the devotees of the God ornated by feather, flowers and <br />flowing <br />  river, the devotee of thriuchcheN^kAttaN^kudi everyday used to <br />host <br />  feast and then only eat. This he followed as a ritual without <br />  failure and his hospitality was known in all the directions. He <br />  being so humble in the presence of the limitlessly famed devotees <br />he <br />  was known as chiRuth thoNdar (small servant). While his service <br />was <br />  continuing blissfully praying the unmeasurable feet of the Lord <br />the <br />  couple got a child. They named him chIrALa dhEvar . To celebrate <br />the <br />  birth of the child who arrived like the fruit of the austerities <br />the <br />  devotee made it a grand festival for the entire town. He donated <br />  liberally to the devotees and made all the rituals with the sound <br />of <br />  vEdas reverberating the sky. The kid was brought up with utmost <br />care <br />  of the parents. When he was three years old they sent him to the <br />  school to learn the worth learning arts. That time the Sun that <br />rose <br />  to drive away the illusions and enlighten the world in shaivam - <br />the <br />  prodigy thirunyAnachampan^dhar (1) came there. Holding his soft <br />feet <br />  on his head and heart the devotee saluted him. The saint stayed in <br />  his place for some days and he praised the honest and whole-<br />hearted <br />  service of chiRuththoNdar in the hymn he sang there. </p>
<p>  The Lord who is independent of external enjoyment wanted to <br />  demonstrate that the great are capable of doing deeds which are <br />  terrific even to think of for others. In place of lightning like <br />  matted hair He took dark cloud like matted hair, in place of the <br />  young growing crescent - a crescent shaped stripes of Holy ash, in <br />  place of snake ear-ring - a floral ring, in place of the ornament <br />of <br />  skulls - a shining string of white stones, in place of the fierce <br />  elephant skin cladding - cladded in clothe, obscuring the black <br />  throat, with unlimited grace in the eyes, smile in the lips, <br />beauty <br />  throughout the body, holding up the spear, the kazal worn in the <br />  legs inviting everybody to salute that form of Mercy, the Supreme <br />  came in the form of a bhairAgi. The God who feeds the entire <br />world, <br />  acting as if He was terribly hungry came to the devotees house <br />  enquiring where it is. Only his wife was there in the house. The <br />  Lord in the form of bhairAgi asked was there the servant of Lord <br />in <br />  the house who everyday gives food for the devotees. Realizing a <br />sage <br />  had come the chaste thiruveNkAttun^aN^gaiyAr came out and said <br />  saluting him that her husband had gone out and invited Him to come <br />  inside the house. The bhairAgi replied He would not come inside <br />the <br />  house where a woman is alone. Immediately the humble lady went to <br />  the other extreme of the house and told Him that as her husband <br />did <br />  not find any devotee that day to host he had gone searching for <br />one <br />  and would be really happy if he knew that a devotee had come on <br />his <br />  own. She asked Him to sit inside the house. The Lord appreciated <br />her <br />  that they followed in the right way the discipline of family life, <br />  but still He would not enter the house without the devotee present <br />  and would be waiting for him under a tree near the temple. </p>
<p>  To the sincere servant who came back sad unable to find any <br />devotee, <br />  his matched wife told that a devotee from the north in the form of <br />  bhairAgi came there and was waiting near the temple tree for him. <br />  With growing eagerness he went to the bhairAgi and saluted to be <br />  asked by Him "Are you the great small servant ?". The great even <br />  though they consider themselves small would be acknowledged as <br />great <br />  only by the Truth ! The humble servant replied that he was not <br />  praisable in the group of devotees but out of mercy the devotees <br />  call him so. He told it was the effect of all the good deeds he <br />  would have done, for Him to come to his house. The sage who <br />claimed <br />  to come from the north said the food He wanted was very difficult <br />to <br />  prepare. He wanted a life to be cooked that too a human in the age <br />  not exceeding five, having no physical impairments, should be the <br />  only child for the family and the child s parents should cook it <br />  happily ! The devotee with uncomparable dedication said there is <br />  nothing in the world that is impossible to achieve for the <br />devotees. <br />  Saluting Him he came back home. </p>
<p>  The devotee told his wife the type of food the sage asked for. <br />They <br />  decided to cook their loving young son for the devotee to have <br />food. <br />  Father went and brought the child from the school. He bathed him, <br />  cleaned his body completely. With the mother holding the child s <br />  hands and legs, the child enjoying their great deed, father cut <br />his <br />  head and did the unimaginable deed. The couple of synchronized <br />  thoughts were not sad but were happy about serving the devotee. <br />  Removing the head considering it would not be good for feast the <br />  loving mother cooked the rest with other food materials. Then the <br />  superior servant invited the sage to accept the feast, begging <br />  pardon for any delay he would have made in preparing the feast. <br />  Washing the Feet that kicked the death to death, they sprinkled <br />that <br />  holy water on themselves and throughout the house. His principled <br />  wife served the rice, meat and all the food materials in a plate <br />  over a white cloth. The sage asked them whether they cooked all <br />the <br />  parts of the child. They replied in affirmative but said that as <br />the <br />  head would not be good for the feast they did not cook it. The <br />  playful Lord said He liked that too. The worry of that wonderable <br />  couple vanished when a helper chan^dhanaththAr came forward and <br />said <br />  that she cooked the head too thinking that it would be useful when <br />  the devotee eats, and gave that part too. </p>
<p>  Now the Lord ordered him to bring a devotee to eat with Him. <br />chiRuth <br />  thoNdar perumAn searched but came back unable to find one. To the <br />  worrying devotee He said he himself was a good devotee and asked <br />him <br />  to eat. When chiRuth thoNdar was about to eat from the food that <br />his <br />  wife served similarly for him in order to make the sage accept the <br />  feast, the bhairAgi stopped him asking what was his hurry while He <br />  Himself who eat once in six months had not started. He asked him <br />to <br />  call his son. Shocked the devotee replied his son would not be <br />  helpful then. But the sage refused to eat without his son being <br />  present. Highly anxious the patient devotee went outside and <br />called <br />  out his son loudly. His caring wife also shouted calling the child <br />s <br />  name, "Oh! my dear child, chIrALA ! come fast to make the devotee <br />  have his feast !!". Who knows the grace of God !! Their son came <br />  running as if he was returning from the school. The couple <br />embraced <br />  him and kissed him thinking they could now be blessed by the <br />devotee <br />  accepting their feast ! When they came inside the house they were <br />  shocked at the absence of the bhairAgi as well as the meat that <br />was <br />  cooked. Removing all their worries, removing their bonds, removing <br />  their source of birth, the Remover of pains the Lord who <br />disappeared <br />  appeared as the form of grace with the Daughter of Himalayas and <br />the <br />  young beautiful son murugan on the Holy Bull. Blessing the <br />devotee, <br />  his beloved wife and loving son the Lord, His inseparable shakti <br />and <br />  the Son who destroyed the sUra took them giving place in their <br />feet <br />  that is ultimate the price for great deeds. Let the marveylous <br />  dedication of chiRuththoNdar stay in the mind. </p>

<p>    But the fact of the matter is most historic novels use <br />charectors <br />  in the sideline as major players because you can use them with a <br />bit <br />  of Creator's imagination and liberty as opposed to certified <br />figures <br />  of history..</p>
<p>    Eg Paranchothi in Sivagamiyin sabatham though the main charector <br />  is Narasimha pallava.</p>
<p>    Parthiban Kanavu...Parthiban though the main Hero is Mahindra <br />  varma Palava</p>
<p>    Vanthiyadevan in PS</p>
<p>    Ilango in Vengaiin mainthan(Akilan)..though the main charector <br />is <br />  Rajendra Chola and his victories</p>
<p>    Ilayapallavan in KadalPura (Sandilyan)...which was set in the <br />  later period of cholas During the Kalingathu parani era featuring <br />  Abaya Kulothunga</p>
<p>    Ilanchelian in Yavanarani.(Sandilyan)set during the ascension of <br />  Karikalan of sangam period</p>
<p>    It just enables the authors to mix facts with fiction and give <br />us <br />  a blend.For Historic novel buff Kadakpura and Yavanarani are a <br />must <br />  read...</p>

        <p>to Mr. Vijayakumar <br />I read yr mail about paranjyothi. He cannot be a hero in anyway. He s a good warrior . no doubt in that. but he is not continuing his carreer as such. If u read "parthiban kanavu" which goes as a continuationn of <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  we could realise this well. Great mamalla chakravarthi does his charecter as a hero even after becoming the father a young girl and guy namely kumdavai and magendran. kalki poses all the heroic images on him the great narasimma pallava only. Due to their "perunthanmai " mamalla and mahendra pallava are admiring paranjyothi Ofcourse v cannot his courageous works to the kingdom as a thalapathi. But always he s a thalapathi only and he cant be a king .</p>

<p>Burnt the lust, which could burn all the discipline, with the <br />beautiful eye between the brows - that Lord's graceful abode is <br />thiruchcheN^kAttaN^kudi . In that town came the man of unimaginable <br />great deeds paranychOdhiyAr . He learnt AyurvEdam, saMskR^itam and <br />the usage of arms in a flawless way. With a matured knowledge he <br />came to the conclusion that crown all the arts is crawling snake <br />ornated God's feet and nurtured steadily the growing love for that <br />comforting feet. Serving the devotees of the Deedless, he undertook <br />the position of the head of the king's army. He won the battle of <br />vAdhApi exhibiting his splendid valiance, brilliance and knowledge. <br />When the king was wondering about his magnificent performance the <br />ministers told him as paranychOdhiyAr was the servant of the Three-<br />eyed Lord there was nobody to defeat him. Hearing that he was a <br />devotee the judicious king was afraid that he had sent a devotee to <br />the killing battlefield. He gave him a lots of gifts and properties <br />and requested him to serve the Lord dedicating his time for that. <br />paranychOdhiyAr returned to his town and spent the all time in <br />serving the sha.nkara at the gaNapathIchcharam temple of the town. <br />He got married to the girl veNkAttu n^aN^gai who stood for the <br />principles of the devotee. </p>
<p>For the devotees of the God ornated by feather, flowers and flowing <br />river, the devotee of thriuchcheN^kAttaN^kudi everyday used to host <br />feast and then only eat. This he followed as a ritual without <br />failure and his hospitality was known in all the directions. He <br />being so humble in the presence of the limitlessly famed devotees he <br />was known as chiRuth thoNdar (small servant). While his service was <br />continuing blissfully praying the unmeasurable feet of the Lord the <br />couple got a child. They named him chIrALa dhEvar . To celebrate the <br />birth of the child who arrived like the fruit of the austerities the <br />devotee made it a grand festival for the entire town. He donated <br />liberally to the devotees and made all the rituals with the sound of <br />vEdas reverberating the sky. The kid was brought up with utmost care <br />of the parents. When he was three years old they sent him to the <br />school to learn the worth learning arts. That time the Sun that rose <br />to drive away the illusions and enlighten the world in shaivam - the <br />prodigy thirunyAnachampan^dhar (1) came there. Holding his soft feet <br />on his head and heart the devotee saluted him. The saint stayed in <br />his place for some days and he praised the honest and whole-hearted <br />service of chiRuththoNdar in the hymn he sang there. </p>
<p>The Lord who is independent of external enjoyment wanted to <br />demonstrate that the great are capable of doing deeds which are <br />terrific even to think of for others. In place of lightning like <br />matted hair He took dark cloud like matted hair, in place of the <br />young growing crescent - a crescent shaped stripes of Holy ash, in <br />place of snake ear-ring - a floral ring, in place of the ornament of <br />skulls - a shining string of white stones, in place of the fierce <br />elephant skin cladding - cladded in clothe, obscuring the black <br />throat, with unlimited grace in the eyes, smile in the lips, beauty <br />throughout the body, holding up the spear, the kazal worn in the <br />legs inviting everybody to salute that form of Mercy, the Supreme <br />came in the form of a bhairAgi. The God who feeds the entire world, <br />acting as if He was terribly hungry came to the devotees house <br />enquiring where it is. Only his wife was there in the house. The <br />Lord in the form of bhairAgi asked was there the servant of Lord in <br />the house who everyday gives food for the devotees. Realizing a sage <br />had come the chaste thiruveNkAttun^aN^gaiyAr came out and said <br />saluting him that her husband had gone out and invited Him to come <br />inside the house. The bhairAgi replied He would not come inside the <br />house where a woman is alone. Immediately the humble lady went to <br />the other extreme of the house and told Him that as her husband did <br />not find any devotee that day to host he had gone searching for one <br />and would be really happy if he knew that a devotee had come on his <br />own.

<p>To the sincere servant who came back sad unable to find any devotee, <br />his matched wife told that a devotee from the north in the form of <br />bhairAgi came there and was waiting near the temple tree for him. <br />With growing eagerness he went to the bhairAgi and saluted to be <br />asked by Him "Are you the great small servant ?". The great even <br />though they consider themselves small would be acknowledged as great <br />only by the Truth ! The humble servant replied that he was not <br />praisable in the group of devotees but out of mercy the devotees <br />call him so. He told it was the effect of all the good deeds he <br />would have done, for Him to come to his house. The sage who claimed <br />to come from the north said the food He wanted was very difficult to <br />prepare. He wanted a life to be cooked that too a human in the age <br />not exceeding five, having no physical impairments, should be the <br />only child for the family and the child s parents should cook it <br />happily ! The devotee with uncomparable dedication said there is <br />nothing in the world that is impossible to achieve for the devotees. <br />Saluting Him he came back home. </p>
<p>The devotee told his wife the type of food the sage asked for. They <br />decided to cook their loving young son for the devotee to have food. <br />Father went and brought the child from the school. He bathed him, <br />cleaned his body completely.

        <p>Hi<br />Kalki had the habit of pulling in real charecters who lived in the <br />time of his storyline.</p>

<blockquote><p>  dear sridhar,</p>
<p>  though kalki does use a bit of imagination in SS on the role of <br />  paranjyothi - i think they all pertain to the early part of his <br />  character ( till he and Mahendra Pallavar gang up and ambush <br />  pulikesi's men in the hill/canyon)....6 months pass and kalki <br />immdly <br />  portrays Paranjyothiyar as a mature battle hardeded veteran and <br />  right hand of mahendra pallavar. below is an account of his heroics <br />  and later life as a saint .....</p>
<p>  chiRuththoNda nAyanAr aka paranychOdhiyAr</p>

<p>  Burnt the lust, which could burn all the discipline, with the <br />  beautiful eye between the brows - that Lord's graceful abode is <br />  thiruchcheN^kAttaN^kudi . In that town came the man of unimaginable <br />  great deeds paranychOdhiyAr . He learnt AyurvEdam, saMskR^itam and <br />  the usage of arms in a flawless way. With a matured knowledge he <br />  came to the conclusion that crown all the arts is crawling snake <br />  ornated God's feet and nurtured steadily the growing love for that <br />  comforting feet. Serving the devotees of the Deedless, he undertook <br />  the position of the head of the king's army. He won the battle of <br />  vAdhApi exhibiting his splendid valiance, brilliance and knowledge. <br />  When the king was wondering about his magnificent performance the <br />  ministers told him as paranychOdhiyAr was the servant of the Three-<br />  eyed Lord there was nobody to defeat him. Hearing that he was a <br />  devotee the judicious king was afraid that he had sent a devotee to <br />  the killing battlefield. He gave him a lots of gifts and properties <br />  and requested him to serve the Lord dedicating his time for that. <br />  paranychOdhiyAr returned to his town and spent the all time in <br />  serving the sha.nkara at the gaNapathIchcharam temple of the town. <br />  He got married to the girl veNkAttu n^aN^gai who stood for the <br />  principles of the devotee. </p>
<p>  For the devotees of the God ornated by feather, flowers and flowing <br />  river, the devotee of thriuchcheN^kAttaN^kudi everyday used to host <br />  feast and then only eat. This he followed as a ritual without <br />  failure and his hospitality was known in all the directions. He <br />  being so humble in the presence of the limitlessly famed devotees <br />he <br />  was known as chiRuth thoNdar (small servant). While his service was <br />  continuing blissfully praying the unmeasurable feet of the Lord the <br />  couple got a child. They named him chIrALa dhEvar . To celebrate <br />the <br />  birth of the child who arrived like the fruit of the austerities <br />the <br />  devotee made it a grand festival for the entire town. He donated <br />  liberally to the devotees and made all the rituals with the sound <br />of <br />  vEdas reverberating the sky. The kid was brought up with utmost <br />care <br />  of the parents. When he was three years old they sent him to the <br />  school to learn the worth learning arts. That time the Sun that <br />rose <br />  to drive away the illusions and enlighten the world in shaivam - <br />the <br />  prodigy thirunyAnachampan^dhar (1) came there. Holding his soft <br />feet <br />  on his head and heart the devotee saluted him. The saint stayed in <br />  his place for some days and he praised the honest and whole-hearted <br />  service of chiRuththoNdar in the hymn he sang there. </p>
<p>  The Lord who is independent of external enjoyment wanted to <br />  demonstrate that the great are capable of doing deeds which are <br />  terrific even to think of for others. In place of lightning like <br />  matted hair He took dark cloud like matted hair, in place of the <br />  young growing crescent - a crescent shaped stripes of Holy ash, in <br />  place of snake ear-ring - a floral ring, in place of the ornament <br />of <br />  skulls - a shining string of white stones, in place of the fierce <br />  elephant skin cladding - cladded in clothe, obscuring the black <br />  throat, with unlimited grace in the eyes, smile in the lips, beauty <br />  throughout the body, holding up the spear, the kazal worn in the <br />  legs inviting everybody to salute that form of Mercy, the Supreme <br />  came in the form of a bhairAgi. The God who feeds the entire world, <br />  acting as if He was terribly hungry came to the devotees house <br />  enquiring where it is. Only his wife was there in the house. The <br />  Lord in the form of bhairAgi asked was there the servant of Lord in <br />  the house who everyday gives food for the devotees. Realizing a <br />sage <br />  had come the chaste thiruveNkAttun^aN^gaiyAr came out and said <br />  saluting him that her husband had gone out and invited Him to come <br />  inside the house. The bhairAgi replied He would not come inside the <br />  house where a woman is alone. Immediately the humble lady went to <br />  the other extreme of the house and told Him that as her husband did <br />  not find any devotee that day to host he had gone searching for one <br />  and would be really happy if he knew that a devotee had come on his <br />  own. She asked Him to sit inside the house. The Lord appreciated <br />her <br />  that they followed in the right way the discipline of family life, <br />  but still He would not enter the house without the devotee present <br />  and would be waiting for him under a tree near the temple. </p>
<p>  To the sincere servant who came back sad unable to find any <br />devotee, <br />  his matched wife told that a devotee from the north in the form of <br />  bhairAgi came there and was waiting near the temple tree for him. <br />  With growing eagerness he went to the bhairAgi and saluted to be <br />  asked by Him "Are you the great small servant ?". The great even <br />  though they consider themselves small would be acknowledged as <br />great <br />  only by the Truth ! The humble servant replied that he was not <br />  praisable in the group of devotees but out of mercy the devotees <br />  call him so. He told it was the effect of all the good deeds he <br />  would have done, for Him to come to his house. The sage who claimed <br />  to come from the north said the food He wanted was very difficult <br />to <br />  prepare. He wanted a life to be cooked that too a human in the age <br />  not exceeding five, having no physical impairments, should be the <br />  only child for the family and the child s parents should cook it <br />  happily ! The devotee with uncomparable dedication said there is <br />  nothing in the world that is impossible to achieve for the <br />devotees. <br />  Saluting Him he came back home. </p>
<p>  The devotee told his wife the type of food the sage asked for. They <br />  decided to cook their loving young son for the devotee to have <br />food. <br />  Father went and brought the child from the school. He bathed him, <br />  cleaned his body completely. With the mother holding the child s <br />  hands and legs, the child enjoying their great deed, father cut his <br />  head and did the unimaginable deed. The couple of synchronized <br />  thoughts were not sad but were happy about serving the devotee. <br />  Removing the head considering it would not be good for feast the <br />  loving mother cooked the rest with other food materials. Then the <br />  superior servant invited the sage to accept the feast, begging <br />  pardon for any delay he would have made in preparing the feast. <br />  Washing the Feet that kicked the death to death, they sprinkled <br />that <br />  holy water on themselves and throughout the house. His principled <br />  wife served the rice, meat and all the food materials in a plate <br />  over a white cloth. The sage asked them whether they cooked all the <br />  parts of the child. They replied in affirmative but said that as <br />the <br />  head would not be good for the feast they did not cook it. The <br />  playful Lord said He liked that too. The worry of that wonderable <br />  couple vanished when a helper chan^dhanaththAr came forward and <br />said <br />  that she cooked the head too thinking that it would be useful when <br />  the devotee eats, and gave that part too. </p>
<p>  Now the Lord ordered him to bring a devotee to eat with Him. <br />chiRuth <br />  thoNdar perumAn searched but came back unable to find one. To the <br />  worrying devotee He said he himself was a good devotee and asked <br />him <br />  to eat. When chiRuth thoNdar was about to eat from the food that <br />his <br />  wife served similarly for him in order to make the sage accept the <br />  feast, the bhairAgi stopped him asking what was his hurry while He <br />  Himself who eat once in six months had not started. He asked him to <br />  call his son. Shocked the devotee replied his son would not be <br />  helpful then. But the sage refused to eat without his son being <br />  present. Highly anxious the patient devotee went outside and called <br />  out his son loudly. His caring wife also shouted calling the child <br />s <br />  name, "Oh! my dear child, chIrALA ! come fast to make the devotee <br />  have his feast !!". Who knows the grace of God !! Their son came <br />  running as if he was returning from the school. The couple embraced <br />  him and kissed him thinking they could now be blessed by the <br />devotee <br />  accepting their feast ! When they came inside the house they were <br />  shocked at the absence of the bhairAgi as well as the meat that was <br />  cooked. Removing all their worries, removing their bonds, removing <br />  their source of birth, the Remover of pains the Lord who <br />disappeared <br />  appeared as the form of grace with the Daughter of Himalayas and <br />the <br />  young beautiful son murugan on the Holy Bull. Blessing the devotee, <br />  his beloved wife and loving son the Lord, His inseparable shakti <br />and <br />  the Son who destroyed the sUra took them giving place in their feet <br />  that is ultimate the price for great deeds. Let the marveylous <br />  dedication of chiRuththoNdar stay in the mind. </p>

<p>    I saw that there was a signigicant discussion of who actually was <br />  the hero Vandhiyadevan or arulmozhi....It was very interesting to <br />  see all your veiws about kalki trying to sideline VD and his <br />  personality and popularity making him immortal...lets face it If he <br />  has made a charecter being analysed after so many decades of his <br />  creation is the author's victory....</p>
<p>    But the fact of the matter is most historic novels use charectors <br />  in the sideline as major players because you can use them with a <br />bit <br />  of Creator's imagination and liberty as opposed to certified <br />figures <br />  of history..</p>
<p>    Eg Paranchothi in Sivagamiyin sabatham though the main charector <br />  is Narasimha pallava.</p>
<p>    Parthiban Kanavu...Parthiban though the main Hero is Mahindra <br />  varma Palava</p>
<p>    Vanthiyadevan in PS</p>
<p>    Ilango in Vengaiin mainthan(Akilan)..though the main charector is <br />  Rajendra Chola and his victories</p>
<p>    Ilayapallavan in KadalPura (Sandilyan)...which was set in the <br />  later period of cholas During the Kalingathu parani era featuring <br />  Abaya Kulothunga</p>
<p>    Ilanchelian in Yavanarani.(Sandilyan)set during the ascension of <br />  Karikalan of sangam period</p>
<p>    It just enables the authors to mix facts with fiction and give us <br />  a blend.For Historic novel buff Kadakpura and Yavanarani are a must <br />  read...</p>

Their son came <br />running as if he was returning from the school. The couple embraced <br />him and kissed him thinking they could now be blessed by the devotee <br />accepting their feast ! When they came inside the house they were <br />shocked at the absence of the bhairAgi as well as the meat that was <br />cooked. Removing all their worries, removing their bonds, removing <br />their source of birth, the Remover of pains the Lord who disappeared <br />appeared as the form of grace with the Daughter of Himalayas and the <br />young beautiful son murugan on the Holy Bull. Blessing the devotee, <br />his beloved wife and loving son the Lord, His inseparable shakti and <br />the Son who destroyed the sUra took them giving place in their feet <br />that is ultimate the price for great deeds. Let the marveylous <br />dedication of chiRuththoNdar stay in the mind. </p>
