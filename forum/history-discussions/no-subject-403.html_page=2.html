<p>IT is not easy to see paintings in Tamil Nadu prior to those of the Vijayanagara period. Why? This is because they are either situated in remote places far from the tourist beat, (like Sittannavasal), or are in a terrible state of disrepair that very little is visible (like Pannamalai) or are locked up and visitors kept out (as in Thanjavur). Thus the two books photographed, designed and produced by C. Nachiappan (now Sri-la-Sri Nachiappa Swami of Koviloor Mutt) with assistance from the Rukmini Devi Foundation and published by Kalakshetra Publications, Chennai, are a valuable documentation of the great Tamil heritage of painting. <br />The first book records the paintings at Sittannavasal, Panamalai and Thanjavur, covering the early Pandya, the early Pallava and the early Chola periods respectively. These sites, which are not easy to visit, were photographed 50 years ago by the Koviloor Swamy. He used an ancient 5"x4" Linhof camera for the Archaelogical Survey of India (<acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym ) and sent the transparencies to Saraswathy Press in Calcutta for exposing. But they got burnt under powerful lights and were never printed. The Swami retained a set of transparencies that were enhanced by computer technology, recreating the colours that would have brightened up the temples once upon a time. The text is written by the eminent scholar Professor P.R. Srinivasan, although he has quoted extensively from earlier works. <br />Sittannavasal is an "elongated mass of granite", a remote village 15 km beyond Pudukottai town, not far from the early Chola temples of Narthamalai, consisting of the Eladipattam, a natural cave on top of the hill with beds and pillows cut into the stone floor for use by the monks, and Arivarkovil or the Temple of the (Jaina) Arihants. There is a First Century Tamil Brahmi inscription on a cave bed, and a Ninth Century inscription on a rock nearby informing us of the renovation of the temple. The cave temple has simple pillars and sculptures of Jaina Tirthankaras. The paintings currently visible probably belong to the Seventh Century, since they have Pallava features and are reminiscent of later Ajanta paintings. <br />The paintings include a dharmachakra on the ceiling, a lotus tank with frolicking animals, creepers and lotuses, young men collecting flowers, dancing apsaras and a barely-visible king and queen, bringing to life the Jaina philosophy of ahimsa and harmony in nature. One apsara, with her right hand in the pataka mudra and the left in the danda hasta, is reminiscent of the bronze figures of the dancing Balakrishna and Balasubrahmanya, while the other is performing the bhujangatrasita karana, associated with the dance of Shiva at Chidambaram. The base of the Sittannavasal paintings is well consolidated, firm yet thin lime plaster, also used for the binding. The painted stucco is made up of three layers: rough plaster, fine plaster and a covering layer of paint. <br />Little remains of these paintings today, making their appearance in the book a valuable contribution to South Indian art history. As a frequent visitor to Sittanavasal, I have seen the paintings gradually disappear, thanks to the pollution from the stone quarries, which is also probably weakening the hill. The lone watchman belies the archaeological importance of the site, surrounded by ancient dolmens and sacred groves with enormous and elaborately decorated terracotta horses. <br />The Talagirishvara Temple at Panamalai is rarely visited, but is notable for the single remnant painting of an exquisite female figure, her leg gently bent and resting against a wall, standing beneath a royal umbrella, wearing a tall bejewelled kirita and jewellery typical of the Pallava period. The figure has been shaded to make it appear three-dimensional. This single figure is one of the most beautiful paintings in India, reminiscent of the women of Ajanta, and the photograph brings out all her glory. She resembles Parvati of the Kailasanatha temple, Kanchipuram, and the Ajanta frescoes. There are traces of painting elsewhere in the temple, but nothing identifiable. The fresco secco method was used here as at Sittannavasal. <br />The best paintings are, of course, those found inside the vimana in the Brihadishvara temple at Thanjavur. The delicate nature of the paintings and the gradual erosion due to pollution have resulted in the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  locking them up. Today they can only be seen by special permission. The paintings depict scenes from the Shiva Purana. But the elaborate tableaux of domestic, public and palace scenes are an excellent source of information about the Chola period and the court of Rajaraja, who commissioned them. The paintings are huge and animated, bringing alive the greatness of the Lord who destroys evil and ensures peace. <br />There is a barely-visible Dakshinamurti beneath a banyan tree on which monkeys are playing, while rishis and animals live together in the forest. There is a stillness of body and reverence on the face of the sages worshipping Dakshinamurti, in contrast to the vivacious animals. Flying apsaras and gandharvas complete the scene of palatial proportions. <br />The Sundaramurty Nayanar story depicts a magnificent Cheraman Perumal on a bejewelled white horse, while an angry Sundaramurti Nayanar wears a white coat! Shiva, in this scene, is an old man. A beautiful tableau is that of Rajaraja listening to his preceptor Karur Devar, the two faces a study of intense concentration. <br />In another panel, dancing apsaras &#151; their faces a study of abhinaya &#151; and Rajaraja and his wives watch in awe the magnificent ananda tandava, the dance of Nataraja performed in the golden mandapam of Chidambaram. Exquisite jewellery, jasmine-bedecked hairstyles, and beautifully featured people with eyebrows like a bow and compassionate eyes bring alive the massive compositions in bright colours. </acronym></acronym></p>
<p>The best painting is that of Tripurantaka, Shiva as the destroyer of the demon Tripura. With wide-open eyes and raised arms, Shiva prepares to slay the demon. An animated Durga seated on her roaring lion prepares to attack the demon's hordes with her raised sword. Brahma is a charioteer, while Shukracharya leads the asuras (demons). <br />What is significant about the Chola paintings of Thanjavur is that there is great emotion in all the faces, whether it is the compassion of the guru counselling Rajaraja, or a contemplative rishi, a devout queen, an animated dancer or an angry Shiva. The photos bring out the varied emotions on the many faces, a feature rarely seen in Indian art. </p>

<p>We have a few feats We have a few big names who have left us for various reasons but My request is to have a moderate balance</p>
<p>Just a humble request<br />I see you guys are infront of your compuers Chandra nad Diwa can you check out the templates we have in the files section and give your valued and esteemed comments</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I was just voicing my thoughts in the group too. Please do not take <br />it as a personal mail.</p>
<p>Since, it was also coming as a sequel to other mails on the same <br />subject, i took the liberty of using the opportunity to continue <br />the thread.</p>
<p>Yes, i completely agree to your view that all elderly knowledgeable <br />people should at all cost be retained in this group. But i dont <br />understand what ridicule has been made. </p>
<p>May be some ridiculing might have happenned in the background which <br />i may not be aware. Iam not interested in knowing that too. But <br />anyway, if such ridiculing has happenned it should be condemned in <br />the strongest of words.</p>
<p>What i wanted to convey too is that the honble prof has made some <br />remarks in the second part of the mail too , which has easily been <br />forgotton and sidelined . </p>
<p>Let us also give a thought to that also. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Diwakar,<br />  I no where mentioned your name in my reply for this subject. I was <br />  surprised why you replied back to me!!<br />  Having known your knowledge in various subjects to ponder, your <br />this <br />  reply to me was much informative than many other mails of <br />ridicule. I <br />  also am not interested in pin pointing anyone. Did I? When <br />Dr.Sridhar <br />  Ratnam quoted..`my head hung in shame.' I too felt the same way. <br />But <br />  it should not be to an extent of making an elderly scholar leave <br />our <br />  group. Mockey or ridicule may not be taken easily by members of <br />all <br />  age group. Isn't it? Where we have to give respect, we have to. To <br />  get back the same respect- as you said the other side of the coin <br />  need not be checked for people beyond our age group and reach. If <br />  possible you can read through what he writes, or otherwise you <br />have <br />  the choice of moving on to the next message. Similarly myself- I <br />just <br />  skip on such mails of personal chat or mockery w/o substance. <br />  But the main theme of this subject should not be lost- we should <br />  leave no stone unturned to bring back men like Prof. who are more <br />  knowledgeable and informative to group like ours. That was the <br />point <br />  I was trying to prove. Nothing else.</p>
<p>  Also, a humble request. When members reply back, they can please <br />  remove the messages that are stuck along- ( Should I explain? I <br />don't <br />  think it is needed! But still I have to say..Just take the cursor <br />  within the reply box, click, go to edit|select all|delete). Then <br />the <br />  whole reply box becomes empty and clean. Members can type their <br />  messages henceforth and on.. <br />  I wish this suggestion will allow us to not read the same message <br />  many a time, in form of attached reply messages! :(<br />  Chandrasekaran</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I was just voicing my thoughts in the group too. Please do not take <br />it as a personal mail.</p>
<p>Since, it was also coming as a sequel to other mails on the same <br />subject, i took the liberty of using the opportunity to continue <br />the thread.</p>
<p>Yes, i completely agree to your view that all elderly knowledgeable <br />people should at all cost be retained in this group. But i dont <br />understand what ridicule has been made. </p>
<p>May be some ridiculing might have happenned in the background which <br />i may not be aware. Iam not interested in knowing that too. But <br />anyway, if such ridiculing has happenned it should be condemned in <br />the strongest of words.</p>
<p>What i wanted to convey too is that the honble prof has made some <br />remarks in the second part of the mail too , which has easily been <br />forgotton and sidelined . </p>
<p>Let us also give a thought to that also. </p>
<p>With Regards</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Diwakar,<br />  I no where mentioned your name in my reply for this subject. I was <br />  surprised why you replied back to me!!<br />  Having known your knowledge in various subjects to ponder, your <br />this <br />  reply to me was much informative than many other mails of <br />ridicule. I <br />  also am not interested in pin pointing anyone. Did I? When <br />Dr.Sridhar <br />  Ratnam quoted..`my head hung in shame.' I too felt the same way. <br />But <br />  it should not be to an extent of making an elderly scholar leave <br />our <br />  group. Mockey or ridicule may not be taken easily by members of <br />all <br />  age group. Isn't it? Where we have to give respect, we have to. To <br />  get back the same respect- as you said the other side of the coin <br />  need not be checked for people beyond our age group and reach. If <br />  possible you can read through what he writes, or otherwise you <br />have <br />  the choice of moving on to the next message. Similarly myself- I <br />just <br />  skip on such mails of personal chat or mockery w/o substance. <br />  But the main theme of this subject should not be lost- we should <br />  leave no stone unturned to bring back men like Prof. who are more <br />  knowledgeable and informative to group like ours. That was the <br />point <br />  I was trying to prove. Nothing else.</p>
<p>  Also, a humble request. When members reply back, they can please <br />  remove the messages that are stuck along- ( Should I explain? I <br />don't <br />  think it is needed! But still I have to say..Just take the cursor <br />  within the reply box, click, go to edit|select all|delete). Then <br />the <br />  whole reply box becomes empty and clean. Members can type their <br />  messages henceforth and on.. <br />  I wish this suggestion will allow us to not read the same message <br />  many a time, in form of attached reply messages! :(<br />  Chandrasekaran</p>

        <p>Angkor Wat in Cambodia.<br />The temples there are older than Thanjavur ...<br />They are so big that it takes one a whole day of<br />bicycling in the hot sun to cover the 26-km<br />circumference of the main temple complex. Intricate<br />kalvettu there too.</p>

        <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>My daughter is studying in Chinmaya International<br />Residential School, Coimbatore, which is one of the<br />best schools in India. They have a heritage club but<br />with very little activity.</p>
<p>I spoke to them about <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Group and the recent trip.<br />The Vice-Principal Mrs.Jayanthi Thiagarajan is highly<br />impressed. </acronym></p>
<p>She wants to know whether any one from the group can<br />come and address the children on Chola History (though<br />they do not have it in their syllabus and hence not<br />useful for "exam"), she wants children to get exposed<br />to our rich heritage. If a group can come and address<br />on different issues, it is all the more welcome.</p>
<p>The target audience would be 6th, 7th 8th standard<br />children. They should feel history is interesting and<br />Tamil History has so much to know - is the goal.</p>
<p>Mr.SB, Venkatesh, Swetha, Ram, Lavanya, Kamal... what<br />do you say? She wants this session sometime in the<br />last week of October. </p>

Anyway, whether you<br />believe what vallalar or siddhargal says is upto you. As for me, I<br />dont have a problem living with the evolutionary theory and praying to<br />the beauty of Thillai Nataraja. It seamlessly intertwine with each other.</mprakas@yahoo.com></p>

Its actually fascinating to read<br />  about the search for the missing links..<br />  AS for cockroaches, there are 3500 species known in world and so<br />  saying that cockroaches did not evolve is not correct.

<p>    Evaluation is like tree with one cell ameba as root.<br />    Lot of branches but all terminate at one point. At<br />    monkeys junction one branch evolves and terminates in<br />    human via the apes. My wild guess.</p>

        <p>Huh..now we are mixing religion and science..Evolution is something<br />that is based on the observance of the physical world around us and<br />infering that this is what has happened. And it fits beautifully with<br />the Geological view and other corresponding scientific views. Thats<br />why it is hard to discredit it although the Christian Creationists<br />have tried their best for the past 150 years. Anyway, whether you<br />believe what vallalar or siddhargal says is upto you. As for me, I<br />dont have a problem living with the evolutionary theory and praying to<br />the beauty of Thillai Nataraja. It seamlessly intertwine with each other.</p>
<p>But, before Mr. Sridhar points out, WTH this has to do with Ponniyin<br />Selvan?</p>

<p>    Evaluation is like tree with one cell ameba as root.<br />    Lot of branches but all terminate at one point. At<br />    monkeys junction one branch evolves and terminates in<br />    human via the apes. My wild guess.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>1. There is a table of all the chola kings with their<br />capitals in one of KNS books but it is only for later<br />Gangaikondacholapuram are the ones mentioned.<br />Puhar/Kaveripoompattinam may have been a capital<br />during the early cholas period but not sure.</p>
<p>2. An illustrated book on 'Vanthiyathevan's journey'<br />is a fantastic idea. It would make many more people to<br />take these routes and get them interested in our<br />heritage.</p>
<p>3. "Aa Northern style Sivanadiar - typical Kashmiri -<br />(present day Bajrang Dal type - with Soolam - Harahara<br />Mahadev type!). Siruthondar happily sacrifices him to<br />Lord Siva!?" - Rather than caricature him as a bajrang<br />dal type, I think the sivanadiyar will be close to the<br />Kalamugargal mentioned by Kalki in both <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym .<br />Infact, mahendravarman appears as one in most of the<br /><acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  as one. And ofcourse, the cult of veera saivas and<br />veera vaishnavas existed in this period of huge<br />bhakthi revivalism and thus he may have been a veera<br />saiva also (like the one Alwarkadiyan picks up his<br />fights with!). </acronym></acronym></p>
<p>I am just repeating what Kalki wrote in his mudivurai.<br />He mentions that there are no records as to the way AK<br />was murdered. In fact he cites a seppedu or kalvettu<br />which just mentions the death and says something in<br />the lines of 'sooriyan marrainthathu..ulagai irul<br />soolnthathu'. There is no concrete evidence as to the<br />site of murder or the time of murder. Is there any<br />progress from the days of Kalki on this front (other<br />than more speculations)?. Of course, we know who did<br />it (ravidasan &amp; co) but how did they do it?. </p>

        <p>The below are the excepts from the book &#147;Naval warfare in Ancient India&#148; by Prithwis Chandra Chakravarti</p>
<p>The facts cited above will amply testify to the sea-faring and adventurous character of the earlypeople of Tamilakam. It was because of the nautical resources of their people, that the Tamil kings had to face no difficulty in creating a navy for offensive and defensive warfare. The sculptor found excellent granite lying about him, and he shaped it into a solid pillar of strength.</p>
<p>We are not sure whether the Pandya kings (whose territory was approximately equivalent to modern Madura and Tinnevelley districts, with part of</p>
<p>Trichinopoly and sometimes also Travancore) ever maintained any fighting squadron. Extreme paucity of materials hinders any inference on this point. But that the Ceras and the Colas came to recognise the importance of naval forces, even before the beginning of the Christian era, there is enough evidence to prove, The Tamil poet, Madalan, refers to an unnamed predecessor of the famous Cenkuttuvan as "he who conquered the Kadambu in the middle of the sea."(1) According to early Tamil authors, Cenkuttuvan, who was contemporary more or less to Nedum-celiyan, the Pandya, and Nedmudi Killi Cola, the grandson of Karikala, as well as to Gajabahu I of Ceylon, led an expedition to the Gangetic valley, and in that expedition"the journey from the Cera kingdom to Orissa was performed by sea." At the end of one poem, Cenkuttuvan is praised as the king "who with his army crossed the sea and reached the banks of the Ganges.(2) Another<br />achievement of the Cera navy under Cenkuttuvan was the victory it won over the Yavanas at sea. The Padirruppattu relates that the victory was so complete and overwhelming that Cenkuttuvan was able to capture his enemies, and punish them by tying their hands behind their back, pouring oil or ghee on their heads.(3)There are other allusions to the naval strength of Cenkuttuvan, and, as Dr. Krishnaswami lyanger points out, the one compliment the poets never miss an opportunity of bestowing upon the Red-cera is that the "Chera fleet sailed on the waters of that littoral with sense of dominion and security."(1) Dr. Aiyangar has also sought to prove that the Cera navy under Cenkuttuvan and his father made a strenuous attempt to check piracy on the western or Konkan coast.(2)</p>
<p>It was under the Colas that the naval power of the Tamil land attained its culminating point. Very early in their history, the Cola kings appear to have organised a fleet of ships, which enabled their troops to cross over the ocean and invade the neighbouring island of Ceylon. According to the Mahavamsa, there were in the first century immediately preceding Christ as many as six Tamil usurpers from the country of 'Soli' (Cola).(1) The first historical or semihistorical Cola monarch Karikala is represented by the early Tamil poets as having invaded Ceylon and carried off three thousand captives to work on the embankments of the Kaveri river, which he constructed.(2) In the fourth decade of the tenth century, Parantaka I repeated the naval expedition to Ceylon and probably won some advantage over its king. It has already been stated that Rajaraja I defeated the Cera navy at Kandalur. Ukkal (Visnu temple) Tamil inscription,<br />belonging to the 29th year of Rajarajadeva, credits</p>
<p>this monarch with having subjugated not merely Ceylon, but "twelve thousand ancient islands of the sea".(3) According to Dr. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, the islands referred to "are apparently the islands along the coast in the Arabian sea".(4) </p>
<p>the triumphal <acronym title="Archaeology" ARCH </acronym with its great doors set with jewels and trap-doors; Pannai, 'watered by the river'; Malai-yur of ancient fame having for its ramparts many hills; Mayirudingam, surrounded by the deep sea as a moat;</p>
<p>Ilanga-sogam, undaunted in fierce battles; Mappappalam, surrounded by deep waters let in for defence; Mevilimbangam with well defended fortress walls; Valaippanduru, possessing both cultivated land and jungle; Talaittakkolam, praised by greatmen versed in the sciences; Madammalingam, firm in great and fierce battles; Ilamuridesam, defended by a strong fleet of ships; Manakkavaram, whose flower-gardens resembled the girdle of the nymph of the southern ocean; and Kadaram, defended in great strength by the sea which touches it.</p>
<p>The identification of place-names mentioned in the above list is beset with great difficulties, and, moreover, may not be quite relevent in the present paper. We would only refer to a valuable contribution on the subject which appeared in the pages of the Bulletin de l'Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient as far back as 1918. The writer of the article is M. Coedes. His conclusions, based on a close and intimate acquaintance with the history of the Far East, stand generally on a surer foundation than those arrived at by Indian scholars. It appears from his article that the countries referred to as having been subjugated by Rajendracola covered the Nikobar Islands, the isthmus of Kra, Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This was the climax of Cola naval achievement. It gave Rajendra one of the great strategic keys of the world. The Bay of Bengal was, so to say, converted into a Cola lake, and a strong impetus was given to that movement of colonisation <br />which had been ushered in many centuries earlier.</p>
<p>The naval supremacy of the Colas continued under the immediate suc cessors of Rajendra. Rajadhiraja, as stated above, not only defeated and destroyed the</p>
<p>Cera fleet at Kandalur but sent out his squadrons on an expedition against Ceylon. The evidence of the Kalingattuparani indicates that Kulottungacoladeva (1070-1118 A.D.) repeated the naval venture of Rajendra and reconquered Kadaram.(1)</p>

        <p>Tha great Raja Raja Chola, defeated Baskara Ravivarma in this battle and also destroyed his naval fleet at Kandalur. It was because one of his envoys to Udaigai, asking for 'Kappam' was arrested by Baskara Ravivarman. This will enrage RajaRaja Cholan to wage the war agaist Cheras.</p>
<p>There was a school in Kandalur to teach usage of Arms and that was destroyd by Cholas. This seems Raja Rajas first war after he came to throne, before defeating Amarabhujanga Pandyan.</p>
<p>I am looking out for a book titled " Vennilavu Penarasi"..This speak in depth about Kandalur Salai. I someone come to know, please let me know, where I can get one.</p>

<p>****************<br />that in the twelfth year of the reign of Rajaraja I,<br />the Cera fleet fought with the Cola navy in the<br />'Roads of Kandalur,' but was routed. The Cera navy<br />was no doubt weakened by this defeat. <br />*****************</p>
<p>It is not twelfth year of Rajaraja. Kandalur saalai war happened during his<br />second year of the reign.</p>

        <p>Few lines from the book, very good...</p>
<p>The facts cited above will amply testify to the<br />sea-faring and adventurous character of the early<br />people of Tamilakam. It was because of the nautical<br />resources of their people, that the Tamil kings had<br />to face no difficulty in creating a navy for<br />offensive and defensive warfare. The sculptor found<br />excellent granite lying about him, and he shaped it<br />into a solid pillar of strength.<br />We are not sure whether the Pandya kings (whose<br />territory was approximately equivalent to modern<br />Madura and Tinnevelley districts, with part of<br />Trichinopoly and sometimes also Travancore) ever<br />maintained any fighting squadron. Extreme paucity of<br />materials hinders any inference on this point. But<br />that the Ceras and the Colas came to recognise the<br />importance of naval forces, even before the beginning<br />of the Christian era, there is enough evidence to<br />prove, The Tamil poet, Madalan, refers to an unnamed<br />predecessor of the famous Cenkuttuvan as "he who<br />conquered the Kadambu in the middle of the sea."(1)<br />According to early Tamil authors, Cenkuttuvan, who<br />was contemporary more or less to Nedum-celiyan, the<br />Pandya, and Nedmudi Killi Cola, the grandson of<br />Karikala, as well as to Gajabahu I of Ceylon, led an<br />expedition to the Gangetic valley, and in that<br />expedition"the journey from the Cera kingdom to<br />Orissa was performed by sea." At the end of one<br />poem, Cenkuttuvan is praised as the king "who with<br />his army crossed the sea and reached the banks of the<br />Ganges.(2) Another achievement of the Cera navy under<br />Cenkuttuvan was the victory it won over the Yavanas<br />at sea. The Padirruppattu relates that the victory<br />was so complete and overwhelming that Cenkuttuvan was<br />able to capture his enemies, and punish them by tying<br />their hands behind their back, pouring oil or ghee on<br />their heads.(3)There are other allusions to the naval<br />strength of Cenkuttuvan, and, as Dr. Krishnaswami<br />lyanger points out, the one compliment the poets<br />never miss an opportunity of bestowing upon the Red-cera is that the "Chera<br />fleet sailed on the waters of that littoral with<br />sense of dominion and security."(1) Dr. Aiyangar has<br />also sought to prove that the Cera navy under<br />Cenkuttuvan and his father made a strenuous attempt<br />to check piracy on the western or Konkan coast.(2)<br />After Cenkuttuvan, the power of the Cera kingdom<br />appears to have been eclipsed by that of the Pandyas,<br />and an almost impenetrable veil is cast over Cera<br />naval operations till we come down to the palmy days<br />that in the twelfth year of the reign of Rajaraja I,<br />the Cera fleet fought with the Cola navy in the<br />'Roads of Kandalur,' but was routed. The Cera navy<br />was no doubt weakened by this defeat. But it survived<br />the shock, and in the time of Rajadhiraja (1042-52<br />A.D.) it again fought its Cola rival at<br />Kandalur-salai, "on the never-decreasing ocean." This<br />second venture was attended with no better fate than<br />the first. The Cera fleet was again defeated and<br />probably destroyed.(3)<br />It was under the Colas that the naval power of<br />the Tamil land attained its culminating point. Very<br />early in their history, the Cola kings appear to have<br />organised a fleet of ships, which enabled their<br />troops to cross over the ocean and invade the<br />neighbouring island of Ceylon. According to the Mahavamsa, there were in the<br />first century immediately preceding Christ as many as<br />six Tamil usurpers from the country of 'Soli'<br />(Cola).(1) The first historical or semihistorical<br />Cola monarch Karikala is represented by the early<br />Tamil poets as having invaded Ceylon and carried off<br />three thousand captives to work on the embankments of<br />the Kaveri river, which he constructed.(2) In the<br />fourth decade of the tenth century, Parantaka I<br />repeated the naval expedition to Ceylon and probably<br />won some advantage over its king. It has already been<br />stated that Rajaraja I defeated the Cera navy at<br />Kandalur. Ukkal (Visnu temple) Tamil inscription,<br />belonging to the 29th year of Rajarajadeva, credits<br />this monarch with having subjugated not merely<br />Ceylon, but "twelve thousand ancient islands of the<br />sea".(3) According to Dr. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, the<br />islands referred to "are apparently the islands along<br />the coast in the Arabian sea".(4)<br />Emboldened by these naval triumphs, the Cola<br />fleet under Rajendra Gangaikondacola pushed out on<br />84 of Cannapatna in the Bangalore District, it<br />appears that by the thirteenth year of his reign,<br />Rajendra equipped and floated a grand armada, which<br />sailing "across the middle of the sea lashing with<br />waves", conquered extensive districts in the Far<br />East. These over-sea conquests of Rajendra have been<br />recorded in many of his inscriptions. For instance,<br />an epigraph inscribed on the Rajarajesvara Temple at<br />Tanjavur and belonging to the nineteenth year of his<br />reign, states that he "despatched many ships in the<br />midst of the rolling sea" against<br />Samgramavijayottungavarman, the king of Kadaram,<br />captured him with all his fighting elephants, and<br />took away from him his huge treasures, He then took<br />possession of Sri Vijaya in the midst of which was<br />set the 'vidyadhara-torana', the triumphal <acronym title="Archaeology" ARCH </acronym with<br />its great doors set with jewels and trap-doors; <br />Pannai, 'watered by the river'; Malai-yur of ancient<br />fame having for its ramparts many hills; Mayirudingam, surrounded by the deep sea as a moat; Ilanga-sogam, undaunted in fierce battles; Mappappalam, surrounded by deep waters let in for<br />defence; Mevilimbangam with well defended fortress<br />walls; Valaippanduru, possessing both cultivated land<br />and jungle; Talaittakkolam, praised by greatmen<br />versed in the sciences; Madammalingam, firm in great<br />and fierce battles; Ilamuridesam, defended by a<br />strong fleet of ships; Manakkavaram, whose<br />flower-gardens resembled the girdle of the nymph of<br />the southern ocean; and Kadaram, defended in great<br />strength by the sea which touches it.<br />The identification of place-names mentioned in<br />the above list is beset with great difficulties, and,<br />moreover, may not be quite relevent in the present<br />paper. We would only refer to a valuable contribution<br />on the subject which appeared in the pages of the<br />Bulletin de l'Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient as far<br />back as 1918. The writer of the article is M. Coedes.<br />His conclusions, based on a close and intimate<br />acquaintance with the history of the Far East, stand<br />generally on a surer foundation than those arrived at<br />by Indian scholars. It appears from his article that<br />the countries referred to as having been subjugated<br />by Rajendracola covered the Nikobar Islands, the<br />isthmus of Kra, Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This was<br />the climax of Cola naval achievement. It gave<br />Rajendra one of the great strategic keys of the<br />world. The Bay of Bengal was, so to say, converted<br />into a Cola lake, and a strong impetus was given to<br />that movement of colonisation which had been ushered<br />in many centuries earlier.<br />The naval supremacy of the Colas continued under<br />the immediate successors of Rajendra. Rajadhiraja, as<br />stated above, not only defeated and destroyed the<br />Cera fleet at Kandalur but sent out his squadrons on<br />an expedition against Ceylon. The evidence of the<br />Kalingattuparani indicates that Kulottungacoladeva<br />(1070-1118 A.D.) repeated the naval venture of<br />Rajendra and reconquered Kadaram.(1)</acronym></p>

        <p>CHULAMANIPANMA VIHARE OF NAGAPATTINAM <br />(A Brief Study) </p>
<p>With the beginning of the tenth century the Cholas with their capital <br />in Thanjavur in Tamilnadu, emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty after <br />a long spell in partial obscurity in the political scene of South <br />India. </p>
<p>In the year A.D.985 king Rajaraja Chola-1(A.D.985-1014) ascended the <br />throne as the next successor of the Chola kingdom. He gradually <br />conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within the <br />Indian continent forming a great Chola empire. </p>
<p>He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his political <br />ingenuity and well streamlined administrative system backed by a <br />powerful army and naval power which made it to grow steadily into an <br />overseas empire. </p>
<p>During this period in South-East Asia there existed the mighty Sri <br />Vijayan empire ruled by a royal dynasty named the Sailendras. This <br />kingdom of Sri Vijaya was located at the lower part of Sumatra in <br />Indonesia, with its capital in the present Palembang. </p>
<p>At the time of Rajaraja on the Chola throne, king Chulamanivarman <br />(A.D. 998-1008) was ruling the Sri Vijaya empire, which encompassed <br />the whole of Sumatra. </p>
<p>In the same period in Malaysia there existed the famed kingdom of <br />Kadaram covering the present Kedah and Perak states adjoining the sea <br />in the north-west coast of the peninsular Malaysia. </p>
<p>However during the period of Rajaraja Chola, the kingdom of Kadarem <br />too came under the sway of the Sri Vijaya empire of Sumatra, with <br />king Chulamanivarman being the overlord of this kingdom. </p>
<p>The trade of Tamilnadu with Sumatra and peninsular Malaysia increased <br />during the reign of Rajaraja Chola. Many Traders flocked to these <br />countries from the Chola country and found settlements and establised <br />units if their trading guilds. </p>
<p>The Traders from Kadarem and Sri Vijaya too crossed the seas to the <br />Chola country with their commodities of trade. The iron ore and the <br />teakwood from Kadarem being two of the commodioties were known as <br />Kadaraththu Irumbu and Kidaravan in the Chola country. </p>
<p>The good trade relations thus established paved way for better <br />diplomatic understanding between these two countries. </p>
<p>The Traders from Kadarem mainly Buddhists by religion sought the <br />assistance of their overlord king Chulamanivarman of Sri Vijaya who <br />too was a Buddhist, to construct a Buddhist Vihare at Nagapattinam in <br />the Chola country. </p>
<p>The Nagapattinam was the seaport city of the Cholas and was well <br />known to the traders of South-East Asia and China, where traders from <br />eighteen different countries traded in their commodities. </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola on the request of Chulamanivarman granted land at <br />Shythiriya Sihamani Valanadu at Nagapattinam to build a Buddhist <br />temple under the name of "Chulamanipanma Vihare". </p>
<p>In the year A.D.1006 a village called Aanaimangalam closer to this <br />site was surveyed and donated to upkeep this vihare from its revenues <br />which were exempted from taxes. </p>
<p>In the following years, in A.D.1008 Rajaraja Chola confirmed on <br />copper plates the earlier grants made by him to the "Chulamanipanma <br />Vihare" at Nagapattinam and exempted same from taxes.. </p>
<p>While the vihare was still under construction king Chulamanivarman of <br />Sri Vijaya died in A.D.1008, and his successor the son <br />Maravijayotungavarman (A.D.1008-1020) completed the construction of <br />this temple, which was also known as the Rajrajaperumpalli. </p>
<p>In the year A.D.1014 Rararaja Chola died after twenty nine years of <br />rule and was succeeded by his son Rajendra Chola-1 (A.D.1012-1044) on <br />the throne of the Chola empire. </p>
<p>After the ascension of Rajendra Chola, king Maravijayotungavarman of <br />Sri Vijaya requested him to reconfirm the grants made earlier by his <br />father to the "Chulamanipanma Vihare" built at Nagapattinam. </p>
<p>This request was granted and Thuvavuran Annukan the agent of the <br />ruler of Kadarem arranged the record of the history relating to the <br />construction of the vihare, and the grant of the Anaimangalam village <br />by Rajaraja which was written on copper plates by one Thillaiyali. </p>
<p>It is evident there has also been another Buddhist Temple built at <br />Nagapattinam at the request of Maravijayotungavarman during the rule <br />of Rajendra Chola-1. Whether that too was named after the king of Sri <br />Vijaya the Maravijayotungavarman is not known, but it has been called <br />as Rajendra Chola Perumpalli. </p>
<p>At Sri Vijaya with the demise of Maravijayotungavarman in A.D.1020 <br />his son Sangirama Vijayotungavarman (A.D.1020-1022) succeeded on the <br />throne. During his rule however the good hostilities that existed <br />between these two empires broke, probabely due to some sort of <br />interference or hinderence to the flourishing Chola trade which would <br />have sparked off the anger of the Cholas. </p>
<p>The strain in the Chola-Sri Vijaya relationship caused Rajendra -1 to <br />send a big naval expedition with a large fleet of ships to South-East <br />Asia in the year A.D.1022. </p>
<p>The Cholas defeated Sri Vijaya, Kadarem, and many other kingdoms in <br />the present Malaysia, and in Sumatra of Indonesia, and it appears <br />eventually the Cholas handed back the kingdoms to the respective <br />rulers on they accepting the authority and agreeing to pay tributes. </p>
<p>However over a period of time gradually the good relations between <br />the Chola country and Kadarem was re-established. During the rule of <br />Kulothunga Chola - 1 (A.D.1071-1120) the king of Kadarem through his <br />envoys Rajavidyadara Sri Samandan and Abimanothunga Samanthan in the <br />year A.D.1091 requested him to reconfirm on copper plates the earlier <br />grants made to the Buddhist temples Rajendra Chola Perumpalli and <br />Rajaraja Perumpalli alias Sailendra Chulamanivarma Vihare built by <br />his predecessors at Nagapattinam in Shythiriya Shihamani Valanadu of <br />the Chola country. </p>
<p>This request was granted by Kulothunga Chola, and in the year <br />A.D.1090 the officers Rajavallaba Pallavaraiyan and Rajendrasinga <br />Muvendavelan arranged confirmation of same on copper plates. </p>
<p>Towards this period the seaport city of Nagapattinam was renamed as <br />Cholakulavalli Pattinam after one of Kulothunga's consorts, and <br />Shythiriya Shihamani valanadu as Keyamanikka valanadu. </p>
<p>These temples no longer exist today. However among the Bronze Buddha <br />Statues excavated in this area by the Archaeological Department. two <br />of them have the following inscribed words on their pedestal <br />confirming the location of the Chulamanipanma Vihare and that they <br />were kept enshrined in them. </p>
<p>(1) "......Chola Perumpalli Alvaar......" (seated Buddha) <br />(2) "......Chola Perumpalli Nayakar....." (standing Buddha) </p>
<p>The exact version of the inscription found on the Item (2) above<br />is as follows.</p>
<p>"(This is) the alvar for a festival procession of the temple of <br />Akkasalai-perumpalli in Rajendra Chola-perumpalli. This alvar was<br />set by Nalan-gunakara-udaiyar of Chirutavur.</p>
<p>Let it be auspicious (This alvar called) Akkasalaikal-nayakar is for <br />all the Padinen-vishayam"</p>

        <p>Krupps - naan eppo thungiye aganum or I will have no time to pack <br />and miss my flight tomorrow.<br />so ciao everyone</p>
<p>Latha - Phew! Glad to have found a fellow feminist.</p>
<p>An IITian on the web has this to say about the translation:</p>
<p>The translation is Great! The **Mann Vaasanai** (nativity) has been <br />retained by using tamil words as forms of address. The translation <br />is so good that one gets a feeling of traversing the Kollidam and <br />Ilangai. It is indeed rare to see translations that can keep up to <br />the authenticity of the original. Although I have not read the <br />complete original, the parts that I read, I thought were superbly <br />translated. Hats off to Mr. Karthik Narayanan for opening the doors <br />of the Chola empire to English readers. </p>
<p>I am planning to buy the books for my husband who can't read Tamil.</p>
<p>I mean afterall he should know whwre I ahd vanished to in the three <br />months it took me to read the book.</p>

        <p>I received a private email from one among your group.</p>
<p>Its about Cholzas before Vijayalaya. </p>
<p>Where were they?</p>
<p>Were they around? </p>
<p>Yes, they were around. </p>
<p>The wife of the Pandya king NinRa Siir Nedumaran, <br />was Mangaiyarkkarasi. She invited Saint ThiruGnyana <br />Sambandhar to rid Pandya country of Jainism and <br />uphold Saivism.</p>
<p>She was a Cholza princess. </p>
<p>During the time of Appar, he found the Siva temple of <br />URaiyuur being concealed by a Jain paLLi. </p>
<p>He started a fast and a satyagrha. </p>
<p>The Cholza ruling in URiayuur had a dream and then<br />he saw Appar, and got rid of the Jains and reopened <br />the temple.</p>
<p>These are instances from ThEvaram times.</p>

        <p>Dear All</p>
<p>I thought the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  website plans were put on hold for the moment till Raja finalised his touches...</p>
<p>But I just stumbled into one of the templates in </p>
<p>www.ponniyinselvan.net.</p>
<p>I am quite surprised and upset because it is done in a half baked way because half the links are not working...</p>
<p>second it relates to discussions in april but with missing links...</p>
<p>It says Ponniyinselvan yahoo groups I thought we all agreed on ponniyinselvan E group</p>
<p>If we place ourselves in the public domain before we are completely ready we are only going to deter people from visiting us later...</p>
<p>whats happening guys? Ram? Raja? Gokul? Kamal?Pavithra?Krupa?</p>
<p>Please let us know</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

        <p>Guys, <br />Looks like we might have arrived a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  early to take the guided tour <br />of "Temples built by Rajaraja I". So lets continue to read some more about <br />Rajaraja I as by Dr.SRB... </acronym></p>
<p>Rajaraja I organised a highly bureaucratic system of administration which <br />aimed at central stability and local autonomy. His revenue administration <br />in particular was noteworthy. By his 17th regnal year, he had completed a <br />land survey of his empire; land as small in extent as 1/52,428,800,000 of a <br />veli was measured and assessed to revenue; there was an elaborate cadre of <br />revenue officers such as accountants, ledger-keepers, issuers of royal <br />orders and executors of royal decrees, at all levels - village, district <br />and central. It is of interest to note that some decades later in England, <br />William I (the conqueror) organized the land-survey was recorded in the <br />Domesday Book. Rajaraja's survey was as elaborate as that of William I, as <br />evidenced by the detailed descriptions of the lands, boundaries, systems of <br />irrigation, revenues to be collected and revenue-exemptions in respect of <br />lands endowed to Rajarajesvaram and other temples in his vast empire.</p>
<p><jana  This is amazing isnt it. I never knew before about existence of such <br />a precise land survey being taken during that period. Well, that's it for <br />today guys... will see u guys tomorrow...</jana></p>

<p>It is like seeing our ancestors in a particular form...it is like <br />speaking with them by seeing/hearing what they have done and <br />appreciating that.</p>

<p>College/school premesis and stories are of 25/50 years old. Imagine <br />the same thing for places, stories which are more than 100, 1000 <br />years! We are identifying our ancestors, and thus ourselves. Maybe <br />sort of "thoandralin pugazhodu thondruga"?</p>

<p>without knowing the consequences, you have left your mouth (vaayai <br />vittutteenga) about your "KUSUMBU" group proposal. You know what is <br />going to happen to you?
