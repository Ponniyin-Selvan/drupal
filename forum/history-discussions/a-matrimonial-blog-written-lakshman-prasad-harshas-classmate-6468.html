<p>This is a FWD.</p>
<p>In our forum people are talking about art / culture / temples and their own<br />contribution in these field.</p>
<p>When compared to that this is crap. But thought I will FWD this to you all.</p>
<p>The person who wrote this blog and myself share a common friend</p>
<p>~ Udanx<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Matrimonial Hunt...<http://lvprasad.blogspot.com/2008/10/matrimonial-hunt.html <br />Are you a Vadama ? atleast a Tam Brahm ? Do you have H1, if yes can you<br />please move closer to bay area ? I am 5ft 2 inches, I need a boy who is<br />atleast 5'10" if not shorter than kobe bryant ? We prefer iyers from<br />Palakad, if not preferably from pittsburgh. Give me a break.</http://lvprasad.blogspot.com/2008/10/matrimonial-hunt.html></p>
<p>Broadminded / like minded / Innocent Divorcee / Chennai Only / H1B holder /<br />East (or) West Coast - The List is endless.If you look into / get a chance<br />to browse any of the matrimonial sites / the sunday edition of Hindu /<br />vernaculars / matrimonial communities which are located in different pockets<br />of Chennai / South India, you would have definitely come across these above<br />stated preferences.</p>
<p>What does H1B / anywhere in bay area going to do with your partner ? If i<br />have preferences of settling in US, I would have accpeted to live as an<br />american and marry an american. What do they mean broadminded ? - I might be<br />broadminded but not to the extent of Shoba de. I have seen profiles of<br />Innocent Divorcees on paper, with the alarming rates of divorces in india,<br />how come all the divorcees are innocent and ignorant. G.O.K</p>
<p>I had chat with my friend sowmi recently and she confided that it is too<br />difficult to identify, choose according to one's preferences. I hear similar<br />stories from few other friends as well. Marriages of late for the last<br />decade (or) even before has become more a matter of convenience, than<br />anything beyond that. If you go to the "Tathpariyams" of marriages, to<br />understand why we need to go for them, understanding the importance /<br />sanctity of the age old institution, we can understand that the modern day<br />marriages have digressed far from the real truth.</p>
<p>I had even heard debates about love marriages vs arranged marriages and I<br />solemnly believe that there is nothing called love-marriages. According to<br />me, there are only two kinds of marriages either you arrange yourself (which<br />others deemed to believe that love exists in them) and the ones which all<br />the mamas and mamis arrange. If at all there exists love, I solemnly believe<br />most of the couples experience that feeling when they cross 50. To me modern<br />day marriages are happening like yet another One day match series which our<br />BCCI keeps arranging with Pakistan/Australia without any reason.</p>
<p>If this is the case with Indian Marriages, Western marriages are much more<br />worse. I had a discussion with my english friend O'shaughnessy and he told<br />me that marriages are more likely to be prelude to go for progeny.<br />Ironically, what i never understand even after my conversation with him, how<br />come people go for livein relationships and stay for so many years with a<br />person and finally decided to marry the same guy and ending up with divorce<br />immediately.</p>
<p>Preferences of modern day youth (both Men and Women) have changed over the<br />period. Its no more about complexion,vital statistics etc which matters the<br />most, but everybody has their own preferences which ranges from the place of<br />origin to your career ambitions. Probably the truth with modern day are<br />people are tired of relationships, they are struggling to find a new<br />partner, new person in their lives. Forget partners, it is very difficult in<br />the modern day to identify few good friends in your life.</p>
<p>Probably this is not an outlet to express my frustration on the hunt rather<br />its the attitude of people (particularly Brahm Community) and so called<br />modern day mindset which is nothing but b****it.</p>
<p>Happy searching if you're in the hunt and if you're already married - all<br />the best for your remaining part of your life.</p>

<p>Stars are too far away to affect us; stars making up each<br />sign of the zodiac are made up of stars from many different<br />galaxies, of many unrelated, incomprehensible distances from earth.<br />They only appear to be related to each other.</p>

        <p>I agree with you entirely when you say "science is science." It is the<br />seeking of truth. A whole bunch of pseudo swamis and such like have<br />corrupted the vedic science and the onslaught of British rule for a 100<br />years has relegated a wealth of knowledge into degradation.</p>
<p>People talk of "eastern science" and "western science" because such a<br />distinction has unfortunately been made. I think this happened as a<br />consequence of British rule. We are led to believe that the so called<br />Western Science is superior due to the evident progress over the last 100+<br />years. So, since science is science, we need to at least re-look at our own<br />known tradition of more than 5000 years.</p>
<p>If you are able to read the books I gave you, it will be worth it. To know<br />spiritual science and truth, we need to listen only to enlightened souls.<br />The Nithyananda videos on youtube are a treasure house of information on<br />vedic tradition from this uniquely enlightened person who is only in his<br />early 30s.</p>
<p>You may also watch Sadgur Jaggi Vasudev, another enlightened person. There<br />are videos in both English and Tamil.<br /><swf file="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v={v}" height="344" width="425" action="swftools_swf_display_direct">=</swf></p>

<blockquote><p>  Sampath,<br />  I see a basic disconnect here between my position and others so far. And<br />  that is this: Somehow, people talk about "eastern science" and "western<br />  science".. to me, science is science..the truth, period. Doesn't matter who<br />  says it. As the Vedas say, "Let good thoughts come to us from all sides"..<br />  this is equally true of good science. Just because something was done in<br />  antiquity in India does not automatically grant it the status of "good<br />  science" just as not every bit of science coming out of the western world is<br />  "valid" or "bad".</p>
<p>  Science is truth.. the way I see it. Now, if people argue that astrology is<br />  science, then they ought to be ready for questions challenging that and<br />  asking for lines of evidence. At least as Sandeep has provided with some<br />  "videos", we can take a look at them. Whether I personally would consider<br />  them as scientific evidence, I can only say after watching them.</p>

<p>    Hi</p>
<p>    You might like to refer to the books I recommended. After reading those<br />    (only after), you can also read "Light on Life:An Introduction to the<br />    Astrology of India," You may also read "Ayurveda:Life Health and Longevity"<br />    Both these are by the same author Robert Svoboda. You may also read<br />    simultaneously - Paramahamsa Yogananda-Autobiography of a Yogi.</p>
<p>    The reason why I am recommending you to read is because without a basic<br />    understanding of the concepts or possibilities, it will be difficult to<br />    comprehend or accept. I myself was in a similar position a couple of years<br />    back.</p>
<p>    If you want to watch some interesting scientific (not western science!)<br />    discourses, you may like to watch a few videos of Paramahamsa Nithyananda on<br />    youtube. I think there are more than 400 videos but you may start watching<br />    them in the following order</p>
<p>    <a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4</a><br />    <a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc</a></p>

<p>    After watching these and if you relate to it, you may check out the rest.<br />    <a href="http://in.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=LifeBlissFoundation" title="http://in.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=LifeBlissFoundation">http://in.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=LifeBlissFoundation</a><br />    or<br />    <a href="http://in.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=LifeBlissFoundation" title="http://in.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=LifeBlissFoundation">http://in.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=LifeBlissFoundation</a></p>

<p>     Agree with your point about us not knowing everything. And about how<br />     it all originated.. there are still a number of hypothesis about that and it<br />     will probably never get solved to everyone's satisfaction.<br />     You again state that "there is a vast science associated with<br />     astrology".

<p>      Yes I do.</p>
<p>       What do you mean by "where did this arise from"? It is a completely<br />       biological process. And then the growth of the body is based on the<br />       nutrients it receives.. so again conservation of mass and energy.</p>
<p>      What I mean is, science as we are generally familiar with, does not<br />      have a proper explanation on the origin of any mass. We are only working<br />      with a few proposed theories. This is vastly different from conducting a<br />      regular scientific experiment to repeat it and get the exact results. There<br />      are just too many factors around that we still have absolutely no clue of.<br />      So we are only relying on what is currently established by (modern) science<br />      and we most definitely can not accept that as the absolute proof for<br />      everything that happens in life. There are vast realms of unproven content<br />      that defy (so called) scientific proof. For this biological process as you<br />      have outlined, there must surely be a bio-memory. Even if you may call it<br />      (simplistically) as a genetic code, did it just happen? Is there any<br />      accountable scientific proof of how that happened yet?</p>
<p>      I didn't say life and death are not scientific facts.. but the premise<br />      of "life" and "death" as some sort of alternate forms of energy is not<br />      scientific.. life and death as spoken about by "spiritual" people are<br />      abstract concepts.</p>
<p>      We will be coming back to where we started! It is not scientific as in<br />      western science that we are so devotedly attached to now for the last maybe<br />      300 years. We have rejected our own systems to follow the 'advanced'<br />      countries. 3000 years back we even had a guild of physicians with laws in<br />      medicine and medical practice. Now the medical council of India gives<br />      prominence to western medicine over our own systems of medicines.This is<br />      just one example.</p>
<p>      Under these tenants, surely astrology can not be accepted as a science.<br />      However, there is a vast science associated with it (as with most other<br />      areas of life) that has been long forgotten.</p>
<p>      You might like to read this book "Aghora - At the left hand of God" by<br />      Robert Svoboda. Its possible that the very foundations of your beliefs can<br />      be shaken. If you can relate to it, you may read the next 2 parts "Aghora<br />      II-Kundalini and "Aghora III-The Law of Karma." Its also available as a set.<br />      Should be available in most good book shops.</p>

<p>         hmmm life is not equal to energy.. that is a fallacy in your<br />         proposition. the "matter" in the body is conserved as ash.. and hence energy<br />         and mass conservations are not violated.</p>
<p>        Even if life is looked at as a period, there was a mass that<br />        functioned with energy and as established by present day science, had its<br />        own energy. But then, where and how did this energy (and mass) arise from,<br />        in the first place, and where did it go? Is there any statistical (or any<br />        other type of) proof with science on this?</p>
<p>         Death and life are abstract concepts.. you can't really bring them<br />         into the equation here.</p>

But whatever little they<br />              have<br />              said, everything has happend....so far.... for that matter my<br />              family<br />              never go behind astrologers...only for my marraige jadagam<br />              matching<br />              they went to an outside astrologer..never before never<br />              after...once in<br />              a blue moon my grandfather or my chittappa (both are good at<br />              this) do<br />              throw something here and there during casual chat...never<br />              looked at my<br />              jadagam fully. Just by my rasi, nakshatram...thats it. So i do<br />              believe<br />              in it. Probably it can be generalization...but still many say<br />              its a<br />              science..</p>

        <p>Sampath,<br />I see a basic disconnect here between my position and others so far. And<br />that is this: Somehow, people talk about "eastern science" and "western<br />science".. to me, science is science..the truth, period. Doesn't matter who<br />says it. As the Vedas say, "Let good thoughts come to us from all sides"..<br />this is equally true of good science. Just because something was done in<br />antiquity in India does not automatically grant it the status of "good<br />science" just as not every <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of science coming out of the western world is<br />"valid" or "bad".</acronym></p>
<p>Science is truth.. the way I see it. Now, if people argue that astrology is<br />science, then they ought to be ready for questions challenging that and<br />asking for lines of evidence. At least as Sandeep has provided with some<br />"videos", we can take a look at them. Whether I personally would consider<br />them as scientific evidence, I can only say after watching them.</p>

<p>   Hi</p>
<p>   You might like to refer to the books I recommended. After reading those<br />   (only after), you can also read "Light on Life:An Introduction to the<br />   Astrology of India," You may also read "Ayurveda:Life Health and Longevity"<br />   Both these are by the same author Robert Svoboda. You may also read<br />   simultaneously - Paramahamsa Yogananda-Autobiography of a Yogi.</p>
<p>   The reason why I am recommending you to read is because without a basic<br />   understanding of the concepts or possibilities, it will be difficult to<br />   comprehend or accept. I myself was in a similar position a couple of years<br />   back.</p>
<p>   If you want to watch some interesting scientific (not western science!)<br />   discourses, you may like to watch a few videos of Paramahamsa Nithyananda on<br />   youtube. I think there are more than 400 videos but you may start watching<br />   them in the following order</p>
<p>   <a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4</a><br />   <a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc</a></p>

<p>     Yes I do.</p>
<p>      What do you mean by "where did this arise from"? It is a completely<br />      biological process. And then the growth of the body is based on the<br />      nutrients it receives.. so again conservation of mass and energy.</p>
<p>     What I mean is, science as we are generally familiar with, does not have<br />     a proper explanation on the origin of any mass. We are only working with a<br />     few proposed theories. This is vastly different from conducting a regular<br />     scientific experiment to repeat it and get the exact results. There are just<br />     too many factors around that we still have absolutely no clue of. So we are<br />     only relying on what is currently established by (modern) science and we<br />     most definitely can not accept that as the absolute proof for everything<br />     that happens in life. There are vast realms of unproven content that defy<br />     (so called) scientific proof. For this biological process as you have<br />     outlined, there must surely be a bio-memory. Even if you may call it<br />     (simplistically) as a genetic code, did it just happen? Is there any<br />     accountable scientific proof of how that happened yet?</p>
<p>     I didn't say life and death are not scientific facts.. but the premise<br />     of "life" and "death" as some sort of alternate forms of energy is not<br />     scientific.. life and death as spoken about by "spiritual" people are<br />     abstract concepts.</p>
<p>     We will be coming back to where we started! It is not scientific as in<br />     western science that we are so devotedly attached to now for the last maybe<br />     300 years. We have rejected our own systems to follow the 'advanced'<br />     countries. 3000 years back we even had a guild of physicians with laws in<br />     medicine and medical practice. Now the medical council of India gives<br />     prominence to western medicine over our own systems of medicines.This is<br />     just one example.</p>
<p>     Under these tenants, surely astrology can not be accepted as a science.<br />     However, there is a vast science associated with it (as with most other<br />     areas of life) that has been long forgotten.</p>
<p>     You might like to read this book "Aghora - At the left hand of God" by<br />     Robert Svoboda. Its possible that the very foundations of your beliefs can<br />     be shaken. If you can relate to it, you may read the next 2 parts "Aghora<br />     II-Kundalini and "Aghora III-The Law of Karma." Its also available as a set.<br />     Should be available in most good book shops.</p>

<p>        hmmm life is not equal to energy.. that is a fallacy in your<br />        proposition. the "matter" in the body is conserved as ash.. and hence energy<br />        and mass conservations are not violated.</p>
<p>       Even if life is looked at as a period, there was a mass that<br />       functioned with energy and as established by present day science, had its<br />       own energy. But then, where and how did this energy (and mass) arise from,<br />       in the first place, and where did it go? Is there any statistical (or any<br />       other type of) proof with science on this?</p>
<p>        Death and life are abstract concepts.. you can't really bring them<br />        into the equation here.</p>
<p>       So if death and life are abstract concepts, are we to assume they are<br />       not scientific facts?!</p>

<p>             Everyone can have their own view....I am not promoting<br />             Jadagam....but<br />             my personal experience....astrologers seldom tell anything on my<br />             jadagam, because they say, yours is kalasarpa jadagam and hence<br />             only<br />             Ragu and Kethu can direct your future. But whatever little they<br />             have<br />             said, everything has happend....so far.... for that matter my<br />             family<br />             never go behind astrologers...only for my marraige jadagam<br />             matching<br />             they went to an outside astrologer..never before never<br />             after...once in<br />             a blue moon my grandfather or my chittappa (both are good at<br />             this) do<br />             throw something here and there during casual chat...never looked<br />             at my<br />             jadagam fully. Just by my rasi, nakshatram...thats it. So i do<br />             believe<br />             in it. Probably it can be generalization...but still many say<br />             its a<br />             science..</p>

<p>There are many votaries for hard sciences, but few for soft sciences.</p>
<p>There are two accepted norms:</p>
<p>Everybody is innocent till proved guilty.<br />The accused has to prove his innocence.</p>
<p>Whether 'astrology' is a science or not is fought in several forums; if<br />'definition of science' is the criteria, no problem, as definitions also<br />evolve and mutate.</p>
<p>Just on the lighter side, the british metro rail system has vastly<br />reduced overcrowding in trains, when objected to by auditors - by<br />changing the definition.</p>
<p>More than 10 standing passengers for every hundred means overcrowding.<br />Now the overcrowding limit is raised to 30 per 100.</p>
<p>My point is, it is OK to discuss the scientific or unscientific nature<br />of astrology; but the knowledge and wisdom preserved over thousands of<br />years must not be allowed to perish.<br />Sampath</p>

        <p>Kathie,<br />:) Well, there are more religious people and believers than "others".. so I<br />am not at all surprised. But it has been a good discussion, without rancor.<br />I am willing to take a look at the videos that Sandeep suggested.. after all<br />a scientific temper implies the willingness to test every hypothesis. :)</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi</p>
<p>  You might like to refer to the books I recommended. After reading those<br />  (only after), you can also read "Light on Life:An Introduction to the<br />  Astrology of India," You may also read "Ayurveda:Life Health and Longevity"<br />  Both these are by the same author Robert Svoboda. You may also read<br />  simultaneously - Paramahamsa Yogananda-Autobiography of a Yogi.</p>
<p>  The reason why I am recommending you to read is because without a basic<br />  understanding of the concepts or possibilities, it will be difficult to<br />  comprehend or accept. I myself was in a similar position a couple of years<br />  back.</p>
<p>  If you want to watch some interesting scientific (not western science!)<br />  discourses, you may like to watch a few videos of Paramahamsa Nithyananda on<br />  youtube. I think there are more than 400 videos but you may start watching<br />  them in the following order</p>
<p>  <a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4</a><br />  <a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc</a></p>

<p>     What do you mean by "where did this arise from"? It is a completely<br />     biological process. And then the growth of the body is based on the<br />     nutrients it receives.. so again conservation of mass and energy.</p>
<p>    What I mean is, science as we are generally familiar with, does not have<br />    a proper explanation on the origin of any mass. We are only working with a<br />    few proposed theories. This is vastly different from conducting a regular<br />    scientific experiment to repeat it and get the exact results. There are just<br />    too many factors around that we still have absolutely no clue of. So we are<br />    only relying on what is currently established by (modern) science and we<br />    most definitely can not accept that as the absolute proof for everything<br />    that happens in life. There are vast realms of unproven content that defy<br />    (so called) scientific proof. For this biological process as you have<br />    outlined, there must surely be a bio-memory. Even if you may call it<br />    (simplistically) as a genetic code, did it just happen? Is there any<br />    accountable scientific proof of how that happened yet?</p>
<p>    I didn't say life and death are not scientific facts.. but the premise of<br />    "life" and "death" as some sort of alternate forms of energy is not<br />    scientific.. life and death as spoken about by "spiritual" people are<br />    abstract concepts.</p>
<p>    We will be coming back to where we started! It is not scientific as in<br />    western science that we are so devotedly attached to now for the last maybe<br />    300 years. We have rejected our own systems to follow the 'advanced'<br />    countries. 3000 years back we even had a guild of physicians with laws in<br />    medicine and medical practice. Now the medical council of India gives<br />    prominence to western medicine over our own systems of medicines.This is<br />    just one example.</p>
<p>    Under these tenants, surely astrology can not be accepted as a science.<br />    However, there is a vast science associated with it (as with most other<br />    areas of life) that has been long forgotten.</p>
<p>    You might like to read this book "Aghora - At the left hand of God" by<br />    Robert Svoboda. Its possible that the very foundations of your beliefs can<br />    be shaken. If you can relate to it, you may read the next 2 parts "Aghora<br />    II-Kundalini and "Aghora III-The Law of Karma." Its also available as a set.<br />    Should be available in most good book shops.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>You might like to refer to the books I recommended. After reading those<br />(only after), you can also read "Light on Life:An Introduction to the<br />Astrology of India," You may also read "Ayurveda:Life Health and Longevity"<br />Both these are by the same author Robert Svoboda. You may also read<br />simultaneously - Paramahamsa Yogananda-Autobiography of a Yogi.</p>
<p>The reason why I am recommending you to read is because without a basic<br />understanding of the concepts or possibilities, it will be difficult to<br />comprehend or accept. I myself was in a similar position a couple of years<br />back.</p>
<p>If you want to watch some interesting scientific (not western science!)<br />discourses, you may like to watch a few videos of Paramahamsa Nithyananda on<br />youtube. I think there are more than 400 videos but you may start watching<br />them in the following order</p>
<p><a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=9q7pkfh1PN4</a><br /><a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=MLeVLc07Bpc</a><br /><a href="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=F2rFMZxkbrA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=8D81B3AA3D2EC094&amp;index=2" title="http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=F2rFMZxkbrA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=8D81B3AA3D2EC094&amp;index=2">http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=F2rFMZxkbrA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=8D81B3AA3D2...</a></p>
<p>After watching these and if you relate to it, you may check out the rest.<br /><a href="http://in.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=LifeBlissFoundation" title="http://in.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=LifeBlissFoundation">http://in.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=LifeBlissFoundation</a><br />or<br /><a href="http://in.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=LifeBlissFoundation" title="http://in.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=LifeBlissFoundation">http://in.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=LifeBlissFoundation</a></p>
<p>There is a huge wealth of information you can get from this enlightened<br />master.</p>

<p>    What do you mean by "where did this arise from"? It is a completely<br />    biological process. And then the growth of the body is based on the<br />    nutrients it receives.. so again conservation of mass and energy.</p>
<p>   What I mean is, science as we are generally familiar with, does not have a<br />   proper explanation on the origin of any mass. We are only working with a few<br />   proposed theories. This is vastly different from conducting a regular<br />   scientific experiment to repeat it and get the exact results. There are just<br />   too many factors around that we still have absolutely no clue of.

        <p>Agree with your point about us not knowing everything. And about how it all<br />originated.. there are still a number of hypothesis about that and it will<br />probably never get solved to everyone's satisfaction.<br />You again state that "there is a vast science associated with astrology".<br />Can you please show some snippets from that? What do you mean by "science"<br />in this regard?</p>

<p>   What do you mean by "where did this arise from"? It is a completely<br />   biological process. And then the growth of the body is based on the<br />   nutrients it receives.. so again conservation of mass and energy.</p>
<p>  What I mean is, science as we are generally familiar with, does not have a<br />  proper explanation on the origin of any mass. We are only working with a few<br />  proposed theories. This is vastly different from conducting a regular<br />  scientific experiment to repeat it and get the exact results. There are just<br />  too many factors around that we still have absolutely no clue of. So we are<br />  only relying on what is currently established by (modern) science and we<br />  most definitely can not accept that as the absolute proof for everything<br />  that happens in life. There are vast realms of unproven content that defy<br />  (so called) scientific proof. For this biological process as you have<br />  outlined, there must surely be a bio-memory. Even if you may call it<br />  (simplistically) as a genetic code, did it just happen? Is there any<br />  accountable scientific proof of how that happened yet?</p>

<p>  I didn't say life and death are not scientific facts.. but the premise of<br />  "life" and "death" as some sort of alternate forms of energy is not<br />  scientific.. life and death as spoken about by "spiritual" people are<br />  abstract concepts.</p>
<p>  We will be coming back to where we started! It is not scientific as in<br />  western science that we are so devotedly attached to now for the last maybe<br />  300 years. We have rejected our own systems to follow the 'advanced'<br />  countries. 3000 years back we even had a guild of physicians with laws in<br />  medicine and medical practice. Now the medical council of India gives<br />  prominence to western medicine over our own systems of medicines.This is<br />  just one example.</p>
<p>  Under these tenants, surely astrology can not be accepted as a science.<br />  However, there is a vast science associated with it (as with most other<br />  areas of life) that has been long forgotten.</p>
<p>  You might like to read this book "Aghora - At the left hand of God" by<br />  Robert Svoboda. Its possible that the very foundations of your beliefs can<br />  be shaken. If you can relate to it, you may read the next 2 parts "Aghora<br />  II-Kundalini and "Aghora III-The Law of Karma." Its also available as a set.<br />  Should be available in most good book shops.</p>

<p>     hmmm life is not equal to energy.. that is a fallacy in your<br />     proposition. the "matter" in the body is conserved as ash.. and hence energy<br />     and mass conservations are not violated.</p>
<p>    Even if life is looked at as a period, there was a mass that functioned<br />    with energy and as established by present day science, had its own energy.<br />    But then, where and how did this energy (and mass) arise from, in the first<br />    place, and where did it go? Is there any statistical (or any other type of)<br />    proof with science on this?</p>
<p>     Death and life are abstract concepts.. you can't really bring them into<br />     the equation here.</p>

        <p>Sampath,<br />Completely agree here. Well an "isolated" system can be as large or small as<br />one wants.. so we can model it anyway we want. However, I agree with you<br />that science and "spirituality" are two different streams. My objection was<br />to using "pseudo-science" to bolster up spirituality .. which is actually a<br />matter of belief.</p>

<p>Nopes.. I don't believe in life after death. Again, I guess our definitionsof what science is, varies. And I can't see any science in how planets/stars can affect our life. (Yes, there is pseudo-science available with claimsabout the gravitational fields of planets etc.. but while that might have an effect at a material level, I genuinely do not see how that can affect my actions).</p>
<p>Anyway, like I said, beliefs can't be debated with!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Sandeep,</p>
<p>  Am enjoying this :)</p>
<p>  Like I said, "there was a mass that functioned"... that mass was either<br />  burnt and converted to ash and other forms of energy.. so the law of<br />  conservation of mass and energy work very well there.</p>
<p>  There is no confusion abou tthat. Do you agree with that?</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Yes I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>  What do you mean by "where did this arise from"? It is a completely<br />  biological process. And then the growth of the body is based on the<br />  nutrients it receives.. so again conservation of mass and energy.</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>What I mean is, science as we are generally familiar with, does not have a<br />proper explanation on the origin of any mass. We are only working with a few<br />proposed theories. This is vastly different from conducting a regular<br />scientific experiment to repeat it and get the exact results. There are just<br />too many factors around that we still have absolutely no clue of. So we are<br />only relying on what is currently established by (modern) science and we<br />most definitely can not accept that as the absolute proof for everything<br />that happens in life. There are vast realms of unproven content that defy<br />(so called) scientific proof. For this biological process as you have<br />outlined, there must surely be a bio-memory. Even if you may call it<br />(simplistically) as a genetic code, did it just happen? Is there any<br />accountable scientific proof of how that happened yet?</p>
<p>I didn't say life and death are not scientific facts.. but the premise of<br />"life" and "death" as some sort of alternate forms of energy is not<br />scientific.. life and death as spoken about by "spiritual" people are<br />abstract concepts.</p>
<p>We will be coming back to where we started! It is not scientific as in<br />western science that we are so devotedly attached to now for the last maybe<br />300 years. We have rejected our own systems to follow the 'advanced'<br />countries. 3000 years back we even had a guild of physicians with laws in<br />medicine and medical practice. Now the medical council of India gives<br />prominence to western medicine over our own systems of medicines.This is<br />just one example.</p>
<p>Under these tenants, surely astrology can not be accepted as a science.<br />However, there is a vast science associated with it (as with most other<br />areas of life) that has been long forgotten.</p>
<p>You might like to read this book "Aghora - At the left hand of God" by<br />Robert Svoboda. Its possible that the very foundations of your beliefs can<br />be shaken. If you can relate to it, you may read the next 2 parts "Aghora<br />II-Kundalini and "Aghora III-The Law of Karma." Its also available as a set.<br />Should be available in most good book shops.</p>

        <p>Sandeep,</p>
<p>Am enjoying this :)</p>
<p>Like I said, "there was a mass that functioned"... that mass was either<br />burnt and converted to ash and other forms of energy.. so the law of<br />conservation of mass and energy work very well there.</p>
<p>There is no confusion abou tthat. Do you agree with that?<br />What do you mean by "where did this arise from"? It is a completely<br />biological process. And then the growth of the body is based on the<br />nutrients it receives.. so again conservation of mass and energy.</p>
<p>I didn't say life and death are not scientific facts.. but the premise of<br />"life" and "death" as some sort of alternate forms of energy is not<br />scientific.. life and death as spoken about by "spiritual" people are<br />abstract concepts.</p>

        <p>hmmm life is not equal to energy.. that is a fallacy in your proposition.<br />the "matter" in the body is conserved as ash.. and hence energy and mass<br />conservations are not violated. Death and life are abstract concepts.. you<br />can't really bring them into the equation here.</p>

        <p>The science that you refer to is material science. Spiritual science is much<br />more vast. Understanding that requires many many life times. Astrology is a<br />small part of it.</p>

        <p>No comments - for or against. Just thought will share what I came across.</p>
<p>A couple of years back, my Sisters family started looking for a girl<br />for my sisters machinan's son. he is in auto industry, decent pay, his<br />father is in business for almost 3 generations...a decent well to do<br />family. They searched a bride for more than 2 years (ofcourse he got<br />married last Jan)..</p>
<p>The demands that they came across....<br />The guy should earn atleast a lakh per month (i commented, they should<br />look for a guy in late forties and not late 20's, because only at that<br />age, there is a remote possibility of earning 1 lakh per month even in<br />IT industry)<br />Girls mother to the boys mother - can I go to US for delivery??</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>I have many telungu friends from my MCA (no offense meant to Telungu<br />people). The guys will say, I am doing PG to increase my dowry. The<br />girls will say, I doing PG to decrease my dowry...<br />veetukku veedu vaasappadi...</p>

Do you have a Green Card? guy answered no<br />? 2.)? Do you work on mainframe or midrange? guy answered mainframe<br />? 3.)? Do you live in Bay area? No<br />?<br />?

<p>Matrimonial Hunt... </p>
<p>Are you a Vadama ? atleast a Tam Brahm ? Do you have H1, if yes can you please move closer to bay area ? I am 5ft 2 inches, I need a boy who is atleast 5'10" if not shorter than kobe bryant ? We prefer iyers from Palakad, if not preferably from pittsburgh. Give me a break. </p>
<p>Broadminded / like minded / Innocent Divorcee / Chennai Only / H1B holder /East (or) West Coast - The List is endless.If you look into / get a chanceto browse any of the matrimonial sites / the sunday edition of Hindu / vernaculars / matrimonial communities which are located in different pockets of Chennai / South India, you would have definitely come across these above stated preferences.</p>
<p>What does H1B / anywhere in bay area going to do with your partner ? If i have preferences of settling in US, I would have accpeted to live as an american and marry an american. What do they mean broadminded ? - I might be broadminded but not to the extent of Shoba de. I have seen profiles of Innocent Divorcees on paper, with the alarming rates of divorces in india, how come all the divorcees are innocent and ignorant. G.O.K</p>
<p>I had chat with my friend sowmi recently and she confided that it is too difficult to identify, choose according to one's preferences. I hear similar stories from few other friends as well. Marriages of late for the last decade (or) even before has become more a matter of convenience, than anything beyond that. If you go to the "Tathpariyams" of marriages, to understand why we need to go for them, understanding the importance / sanctity of the age old institution, we can understand that the modern day marriages have digressed far from the real truth.</p>
<p>I had even heard debates about love marriages vs arranged marriages and I solemnly believe that there is nothing called love-marriages. According to me, there are only two kinds of marriages either you arrange yourself (whichothers deemed to believe that love exists in them) and the ones which all the mamas and mamis arrange. If at all there exists love, I solemnly believe most of the couples experience that feeling when they cross 50. To me modern day marriages are happening like yet another One day match series whichour BCCI keeps arranging with Pakistan/Australia without any reason. </p>
<p>If this is the case with Indian Marriages, Western marriages are much more worse. I had a discussion with my english friend O'shaughnessy and he told me that marriages are more likely to be prelude to go for progeny. Ironically, what i never understand even after my conversation with him, how come people go for livein relationships and stay for so many years with a person and finally decided to marry the same guy and ending up with divorce immediately. </p>
<p>Preferences of modern day youth (both Men and Women) have changed over the period. Its no more about complexion,vital statistics etc which matters themost, but everybody has their own preferences which ranges from the place of origin to your career ambitions. Probably the truth with modern day are people are tired of relationships, they are struggling to find a new partner, new person in their lives. Forget partners, it is very difficult in the modern day to identify few good friends in your life. </p>
<p>Probably this is not an outlet to express my frustration on the hunt ratherits the attitude of people (particularly Brahm Community) and so called modern day mindset which is nothing but b****it.</p>
<p>Happy searching if you're in the hunt and if you're already married - all the best for your remaining part of your life.</p>

<p>  Hi Rahul</p>
<p>  this was just one case of nri matrimonial system</p>
<p>  since tam bramhins are the most visible amongst nris they have been <br />  chosen as a background.<br />  i am sure many castes have overtaken bramin emigrant numbers.</p>
<p>  even percentage wise <br />  some communities like the nagarathars have almost a tenth of their <br />  population abroad.<br />  i used to have a classmate who didnt get married till he was 30. he <br />  was n the us. his mother used to plead" caste not important, <br />jathakam <br />  not important, money not important ponnu computer padichirutnhaa <br />  pothum" this was in the early ninetes.</p>
<p>  we used to poke fun at her ( may her soul now rest in peace) <br />  aunty you can marry off your son to a computer. athu better.<br />  it was very common to seek employable brides in us those days.<br />  things change but expectations remain.<br />  just like the rajarika marriages of ponniyin selvan.</p>

We<br />prefer<br />  iyers <br />  from<br />      Palakad, if not preferably from pittsburgh. Give me a break.</http://lvprasad.blogspot.com/2008/10/<br></p>
<p>      Broadminded / like minded / Innocent Divorcee / Chennai Only / <br />  H1B holder /<br />      East (or) West Coast - The List is endless.If you look into / <br />get <br />  a chance<br />      to browse any of the matrimonial sites / the sunday edition of <br />  Hindu /<br />      vernaculars / matrimonial communities which are located in <br />  different pockets<br />      of Chennai / South India, you would have definitely come across <br />  these above<br />      stated preferences.</p>
<p>      What does H1B / anywhere in bay area going to do with your <br />  partner ? If i<br />      have preferences of settling in US, I would have accpeted to <br />live <br />  as an<br />      american and marry an american. What do they mean broadminded ? <br />- <br />  I might be<br />      broadminded but not to the extent of Shoba de. I have seen <br />  profiles of<br />      Innocent Divorcees on paper, with the alarming rates of <br />divorces <br />  in india,<br />      how come all the divorcees are innocent and ignorant. G.O.K</p>
<p>      I had chat with my friend sowmi recently and she confided that <br />it <br />  is too<br />      difficult to identify, choose according to one's<br />preferences. I <br />  hear similar<br />      stories from few other friends as well. Marriages of late for <br />the <br />  last<br />      decade (or) even before has become more a matter of <br />convenience, <br />  than<br />      anything beyond that. If you go to the "Tathpariyams"<br />of <br />  marriages, to<br />      understand why we need to go for them, understanding the <br />  importance /<br />      sanctity of the age old institution, we can understand that the <br />  modern day<br />      marriages have digressed far from the real truth.</p>
<p>      I had even heard debates about love marriages vs arranged <br />  marriages and I<br />      solemnly believe that there is nothing called love-marriages. <br />  According to<br />      me, there are only two kinds of marriages either you arrange <br />  yourself (which<br />      others deemed to believe that love exists in them) and the ones <br />  which all<br />      the mamas and mamis arrange. If at all there exists love, I <br />  solemnly believe<br />      most of the couples experience that feeling when they cross 50. <br />  To me modern<br />      day marriages are happening like yet another One day match <br />series <br />  which our<br />      BCCI keeps arranging with Pakistan/Australia without any reason.</p>
<p>      If this is the case with Indian Marriages, Western marriages <br />are <br />  much more<br />      worse. I had a discussion with my english friend<br />O'shaughnessy <br />  and he told<br />      me that marriages are more likely to be prelude to go for <br />progeny.<br />      Ironically, what i never understand even after my conversation <br />  with him, how<br />      come people go for livein relationships and stay for so many <br />  years with a<br />      person and finally decided to marry the same guy and ending up <br />  with divorce<br />      immediately.</p>
<p>      Preferences of modern day youth (both Men and Women) have <br />changed <br />  over the<br />      period. Its no more about complexion,vital statistics etc which <br />  matters the<br />      most, but everybody has their own preferences which ranges from <br />  the place of<br />      origin to your career ambitions. Probably the truth with modern <br />  day are<br />      people are tired of relationships, they are struggling to find <br />a <br />  new<br />      partner, new person in their lives. Forget partners, it is very <br />  difficult in<br />      the modern day to identify few good friends in your life.</p>
<p>      Probably this is not an outlet to express my frustration on the <br />  hunt rather<br />      its the attitude of people (particularly Brahm Community) and <br />so <br />  called<br />      modern day mindset which is nothing but b****it.</p>
<p>      Happy searching if you're in the hunt and if you're<br />already <br />  married - all<br />      the best for your remaining part of your life.</p>

I had a discussion with my english friend O'shaughnessy <br />  and he told<br />      me that marriages are more likely to be prelude to go for <br />progeny.<br />      Ironically, what i never understand even after my conversation <br />  with him, how<br />      come people go for livein relationships and stay for so many <br />  years with a<br />      person and finally decided to marry the same guy and ending up <br />  with divorce<br />      immediately.</p>
<p>      Preferences of modern day youth (both Men and Women) have <br />changed <br />  over the<br />      period. Its no more about complexion,vital statistics etc which <br />  matters the<br />      most, but everybody has their own preferences which ranges from <br />  the place of<br />      origin to your career ambitions. Probably the truth with modern <br />  day are<br />      people are tired of relationships, they are struggling to find <br />a <br />  new<br />      partner, new person in their lives. Forget partners, it is very <br />  difficult in<br />      the modern day to identify few good friends in your life.</p>
<p>      Probably this is not an outlet to express my frustration on the <br />  hunt rather<br />      its the attitude of people (particularly Brahm Community) and <br />so <br />  called<br />      modern day mindset which is nothing but b****it.</p>
<p>      Happy searching if you're in the hunt and if you're already <br />  married - all<br />      the best for your remaining part of your life.</p>

<p>Hi Rahul</p>
<p>this was just one case of nri matrimonial system</p>
<p>since tam bramhins are the most visible amongst nris they have been <br />chosen as a background.<br />i am sure many castes have overtaken bramin emigrant numbers.</p>
<p>even percentage wise <br />some communities like the nagarathars have almost a tenth of their <br />population abroad.<br />i used to have a classmate who didnt get married till he was 30. he <br />was n the us. his mother used to plead" caste not important, jathakam <br />not important, money not important ponnu computer padichirutnhaa <br />pothum" this was in the early ninetes.</p>
<p>we used to poke fun at her ( may her soul now rest in peace) <br />aunty you can marry off your son to a computer. athu better.<br />it was very common to seek employable brides in us those days.<br />things change but expectations remain.<br />just like the rajarika marriages of ponniyin selvan.</p>

<p>    Broadminded / like minded / Innocent Divorcee / Chennai Only / <br />H1B holder /<br />    East (or) West Coast - The List is endless.If you look into / get <br />a chance<br />    to browse any of the matrimonial sites / the sunday edition of <br />Hindu /<br />    vernaculars / matrimonial communities which are located in <br />different pockets<br />    of Chennai / South India, you would have definitely come across <br />these above<br />    stated preferences.</p>
<p>    What does H1B / anywhere in bay area going to do with your <br />partner ? If i<br />    have preferences of settling in US, I would have accpeted to live <br />as an<br />    american and marry an american. What do they mean broadminded ? - <br />I might be<br />    broadminded but not to the extent of Shoba de. I have seen <br />profiles of<br />    Innocent Divorcees on paper, with the alarming rates of divorces <br />in india,<br />    how come all the divorcees are innocent and ignorant. G.O.K</p>
<p>    I had chat with my friend sowmi recently and she confided that it <br />is too<br />    difficult to identify, choose according to one's preferences. I <br />hear similar<br />    stories from few other friends as well. Marriages of late for the <br />last<br />    decade (or) even before has become more a matter of convenience, <br />than<br />    anything beyond that. If you go to the "Tathpariyams" of <br />marriages, to<br />    understand why we need to go for them, understanding the <br />importance /<br />    sanctity of the age old institution, we can understand that the <br />modern day<br />    marriages have digressed far from the real truth.</p>
<p>    I had even heard debates about love marriages vs arranged <br />marriages and I<br />    solemnly believe that there is nothing called love-marriages. <br />According to<br />    me, there are only two kinds of marriages either you arrange <br />yourself (which<br />    others deemed to believe that love exists in them) and the ones <br />which all<br />    the mamas and mamis arrange.

        <p>Udanx; I too have a cousin who fits the very same profile you are citing. The<br />reason he's still unmarried is because he takes the "jaadagam matching"<br />criteria too far. Your friends probably have such a criteria.<br />Ask them to give a honest reason on why they haven't found(thats the word,<br />shouldn't use the word "got") a match. Trust me, they would have rejected a<br />few for a particular reason which they are unable to compromise.</p>

Do you have H1, if yes can you<br />      please move closer to bay area ? I am 5ft 2 inches, I need a boy who is<br />      atleast 5'10" if not shorter than kobe bryant ? We prefer iyers from<br />      Palakad, if not preferably from pittsburgh. Give me a break.</http://lvprasad.blogspot.com/2008/10/matrimonial-hunt.html></p>
<p>      Broadminded / like minded / Innocent Divorcee / Chennai Only / H1B<br />      holder / East (or) West Coast - The List is endless.If you look into / get a<br />      chance to browse any of the matrimonial sites / the sunday edition of Hindu<br />      / vernaculars / matrimonial communities which are located in different<br />      pockets of Chennai / South India, you would have definitely come across<br />      these above stated preferences.</p>
<p>      What does H1B / anywhere in bay area going to do with your partner ? If<br />      i have preferences of settling in US, I would have accpeted to live as an<br />      american and marry an american. What do they mean broadminded ? - I might be<br />      broadminded but not to the extent of Shoba de. I have seen profiles of<br />      Innocent Divorcees on paper, with the alarming rates of divorces in india,<br />      how come all the divorcees are innocent and ignorant. G.O.K</p>
<p>      I had chat with my friend sowmi recently and she confided that it is<br />      too difficult to identify, choose according to one's preferences. I hear<br />      similar stories from few other friends as well. Marriages of late for the<br />      last decade (or) even before has become more a matter of convenience, than<br />      anything beyond that. If you go to the "Tathpariyams" of marriages, to<br />      understand why we need to go for them, understanding the importance /<br />      sanctity of the age old institution, we can understand that the modern day<br />      marriages have digressed far from the real truth.</p>
<p>      I had even heard debates about love marriages vs arranged marriages and<br />      I solemnly believe that there is nothing called love-marriages. According to<br />      me, there are only two kinds of marriages either you arrange yourself (which<br />      others deemed to believe that love exists in them) and the ones which all<br />      the mamas and mamis arrange. If at all there exists love, I solemnly believe<br />      most of the couples experience that feeling when they cross 50. To me modern<br />      day marriages are happening like yet another One day match series which our<br />      BCCI keeps arranging with Pakistan/Australia without any reason.</p>
<p>      If this is the case with Indian Marriages, Western marriages are much<br />      more worse. I had a discussion with my english friend O'shaughnessy and he<br />      told me that marriages are more likely to be prelude to go for progeny.<br />      Ironically, what i never understand even after my conversation with him, how<br />      come people go for livein relationships and stay for so many years with a<br />      person and finally decided to marry the same guy and ending up with divorce<br />      immediately.</p>
<p>      Preferences of modern day youth (both Men and Women) have changed over<br />      the period. Its no more about complexion,vital statistics etc which matters<br />      the most, but everybody has their own preferences which ranges from the<br />      place of origin to your career ambitions. Probably the truth with modern day<br />      are people are tired of relationships, they are struggling to find a new<br />      partner, new person in their lives. Forget partners, it is very difficult in<br />      the modern day to identify few good friends in your life.</p>
<p>      Probably this is not an outlet to express my frustration on the hunt<br />      rather its the attitude of people (particularly Brahm Community) and so<br />      called modern day mindset which is nothing but b****it.</p>
<p>      Happy searching if you're in the hunt and if you're already married -<br />      all the best for your remaining part of your life.</p>

        <p>Its a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  like the Muslims claiming everything is a Zionist conspiracy.. :)<br />In our house we have made a joke of that.. anytime we can't explain<br />something.. we put it down to "Zionist conspiracy"..</acronym></p>
<p>Having said that, I don't think Udanx was making an anti-Brahmin statement..<br />I think the blog writer just happened to be a TamBrahm but the issue is the<br />same across caste-lines in India</p>

Do you have H1, if yes can you<br />    please move closer to bay area ? I am 5ft 2 inches, I need a boy who is<br />    atleast 5'10" if not shorter than kobe bryant ? We prefer iyers from<br />    Palakad, if not preferably from pittsburgh. Give me a break.</http://lvprasad.blogspot.com/2008/10/matrimonial-hunt.html></p>
<p>    Broadminded / like minded / Innocent Divorcee / Chennai Only / H1B holder<br />    / East (or) West Coast - The List is endless.If you look into / get a chance<br />    to browse any of the matrimonial sites / the sunday edition of Hindu /<br />    vernaculars / matrimonial communities which are located in different pockets<br />    of Chennai / South India, you would have definitely come across these above<br />    stated preferences.</p>
<p>    What does H1B / anywhere in bay area going to do with your partner ? If i<br />    have preferences of settling in US, I would have accpeted to live as an<br />    american and marry an american. What do they mean broadminded ? - I might be<br />    broadminded but not to the extent of Shoba de. I have seen profiles of<br />    Innocent Divorcees on paper, with the alarming rates of divorces in india,<br />    how come all the divorcees are innocent and ignorant. G.O.K</p>
<p>    I had chat with my friend sowmi recently and she confided that it is too<br />    difficult to identify, choose according to one's preferences. I hear similar<br />    stories from few other friends as well. Marriages of late for the last<br />    decade (or) even before has become more a matter of convenience, than<br />    anything beyond that. If you go to the "Tathpariyams" of marriages, to<br />    understand why we need to go for them, understanding the importance /<br />    sanctity of the age old institution, we can understand that the modern day<br />    marriages have digressed far from the real truth.</p>
<p>    I had even heard debates about love marriages vs arranged marriages and I<br />    solemnly believe that there is nothing called love-marriages. According to<br />    me, there are only two kinds of marriages either you arrange yourself (which<br />    others deemed to believe that love exists in them) and the ones which all<br />    the mamas and mamis arrange. If at all there exists love, I solemnly believe<br />    most of the couples experience that feeling when they cross 50. To me modern<br />    day marriages are happening like yet another One day match series which our<br />    BCCI keeps arranging with Pakistan/Australia without any reason.</p>
<p>    If this is the case with Indian Marriages, Western marriages are much<br />    more worse. I had a discussion with my english friend O'shaughnessy and he<br />    told me that marriages are more likely to be prelude to go for progeny.<br />    Ironically, what i never understand even after my conversation with him, how<br />    come people go for livein relationships and stay for so many years with a<br />    person and finally decided to marry the same guy and ending up with divorce<br />    immediately.</p>
<p>    Preferences of modern day youth (both Men and Women) have changed over<br />    the period. Its no more about complexion,vital statistics etc which matters<br />    the most, but everybody has their own preferences which ranges from the<br />    place of origin to your career ambitions. Probably the truth with modern day<br />    are people are tired of relationships, they are struggling to find a new<br />    partner, new person in their lives. Forget partners, it is very difficult in<br />    the modern day to identify few good friends in your life.</p>
<p>    Probably this is not an outlet to express my frustration on the hunt<br />    rather its the attitude of people (particularly Brahm Community) and so<br />    called modern day mindset which is nothing but b****it.</p>
<p>    Happy searching if you're in the hunt and if you're already married - all<br />    the best for your remaining part of your life.</p>

I am just pointing out that girls these days are demanding as the guys<br />use to be a couple of decades back OR even before that.<br />4. I am posing a question to this forum - Whether this trend is good or<br />bad. Nothing against Tam Bram for that matter any community.</p>

<p>   This is a FWD.</p>
<p>   In our forum people are talking about art / culture / temples and their<br />   own contribution in these field.</p>
<p>   When compared to that this is crap. But thought I will FWD this to you<br />   all.</p>

<p>   Broadminded / like minded / Innocent Divorcee / Chennai Only / H1B holder<br />   / East (or) West Coast - The List is endless.If you look into / get a chance<br />   to browse any of the matrimonial sites / the sunday edition of Hindu /<br />   vernaculars / matrimonial communities which are located in different pockets<br />   of Chennai / South India, you would have definitely come across these above<br />   stated preferences.</p>
<p>   What does H1B / anywhere in bay area going to do with your partner ? If i<br />   have preferences of settling in US, I would have accpeted to live as an<br />   american and marry an american. What do they mean broadminded ? - I might be<br />   broadminded but not to the extent of Shoba de. I have seen profiles of<br />   Innocent Divorcees on paper, with the alarming rates of divorces in india,<br />   how come all the divorcees are innocent and ignorant. G.O.K</p>
<p>   I had chat with my friend sowmi recently and she confided that it is too<br />   difficult to identify, choose according to one's preferences. I hear similar<br />   stories from few other friends as well. Marriages of late for the last<br />   decade (or) even before has become more a matter of convenience, than<br />   anything beyond that. If you go to the "Tathpariyams" of marriages, to<br />   understand why we need to go for them, understanding the importance /<br />   sanctity of the age old institution, we can understand that the modern day<br />   marriages have digressed far from the real truth.</p>
<p>   I had even heard debates about love marriages vs arranged marriages and I<br />   solemnly believe that there is nothing called love-marriages. According to<br />   me, there are only two kinds of marriages either you arrange yourself (which<br />   others deemed to believe that love exists in them) and the ones which all<br />   the mamas and mamis arrange. If at all there exists love, I solemnly believe<br />   most of the couples experience that feeling when they cross 50. To me modern<br />   day marriages are happening like yet another One day match series which our<br />   BCCI keeps arranging with Pakistan/Australia without any reason.</p>
<p>   If this is the case with Indian Marriages, Western marriages are much more<br />   worse. I had a discussion with my english friend O'shaughnessy and he told<br />   me that marriages are more likely to be prelude to go for progeny.<br />   Ironically, what i never understand even after my conversation with him, how<br />   come people go for livein relationships and stay for so many years with a<br />   person and finally decided to marry the same guy and ending up with divorce<br />   immediately.</p>
<p>   Preferences of modern day youth (both Men and Women) have changed over the<br />   period. Its no more about complexion,vital statistics etc which matters the<br />   most, but everybody has their own preferences which ranges from the place of<br />   origin to your career ambitions. Probably the truth with modern day are<br />   people are tired of relationships, they are struggling to find a new<br />   partner, new person in their lives. Forget partners, it is very difficult in<br />   the modern day to identify few good friends in your life.</p>
<p>   Probably this is not an outlet to express my frustration on the hunt<br />   rather its the attitude of people (particularly Brahm Community) and so<br />   called modern day mindset which is nothing but b****it.</p>
<p>   Happy searching if you're in the hunt and if you're already married - all<br />   the best for your remaining part of your life.</p>
