<p>s.balasubramani <br />098531 25026<br />Bhubaneswar</p>
<p>Detail History of Orissa related with Tamil country during chola period<br />The Imperial Gangas<br />The Eastern Gangas who started their rule in Kalinga about the end of the 5 th century A.D. continued as a petty power till the time of Vajrahasta V who came to the throne in 1038 A.D. As mentioned above he was the son of Kamarnava II by his queen Vinaya Mahadevi. He made Kalinga independent by defeating the Somavamsis and declared himself Maharajadhiraja. He also received the title of Trikalingadhipati. He made matrimonial alliance with the Kalachuris of Kosala and also with the ruling family of Ceylone. This helped him in consolidating the political power of his family. He was succeeded in 1070 A.D. by his son Rajrajdev I born of his queen Anangadevi. Rajarajdev was faced with his enemies, the Somavamsis of Utkal in the north and the Chalukya of Vengi in the south. By 1075 A.D. his Commander Vanapati of Vengi obtained victory over the kings of Chola, Utkal, Khemundi, Kosala, Gidvisingi and Vengi. The Somavamsi king Janamejaya II was defeated but succeeded in protecting<br />his kingdom. By that time Kulattunga was the ruler of the Chola kingdom. By that time Kulattunga was the ruler of the Choloa kingdom. His General Daddarnava who was the Governor of Vengi was defeated and killed by Vanapati.</p>
<p>Rajarajdev married Rajasundari, the daughter of Kulattunga who was then known as Rajendra Chola II.<br />Rajrajdev had a premature death in 1077 A.D. He left two young sons, the elder Chola Gangadeva being of two years in age. This young boy was crowned at Kalinganagar in February, 1078 A.D. Vira Choda, the third son of Kulattunga, was the Viceroy of Vengi till 1093 A.D. He was supporting the Gangas of Kalinga and in 1093 A.D., Chodagangadeva married Chodadevi, the daughter of Vira Choda. As a result of that Vira Choda was removed from power and expelled from Vengi by his father Kulattunga. Vira Choda was of great help to Chodagangadeva in his wars against Vengi and Utkal. The first war against Vengi was fought in 1093-94 A.D. in which the Gangas were defeated and the southern part of Kalinga was occupied by the Cholas. The second Vengi-Kalinga war took place in 1110 A.D. and this time also Kalinga sustained heavy loss. But Chodaganga was succeeded in his war against Utkal. Kamadeva, the Somavamsi King of Utkal was defeated in 1110 A.D. It appears that the wars against Vengi<br />and against Utkal were fought simultaneously. Jayasimha, the Chief of Dandabhukti who was feudatory of Ramapala of Gauda, helped Kamadeva at the time of his defeat at the hands of Cholagangadeva, as a result of which Chodagangadeva allowed the defeated King Kamadeva to continue his rule as a vassal chief. After consolidating his power Chodagangadeva marched towards the north and overran Dandabhukti. After that he occupied the Sumha territory where he appointed his nominee Samantasena as ruler. Subsequently Samantasena founded the Sen dynasty in Bengal.<br />Kulattunga died in 1118 A.D. and with his detath the power of the Chodas began to decline. By 1118 A.D. Chodagangadeva annexed Utkal and Vengi to his empire which by that time extended from the Ganga in the north to the Godavari in the south. After the occupation of Utkal Chodagangadeva had to face with the powerful Kalachuri king-Jajalladeva who by that time had extended his power up to Suvarnapura of South Kosala. Chodaganga had a design to occupy the Sonepur region which was once under the rule of the Somavamsis. But he was defeated by the Kalachuri king Ratnadeva II, son and successor of Jajalladeva. In course of the war Purusottama, the General of Ratnadeva II, occupied Kalinga (modern Khiching in Mayurbhanj district). Chodagangadeva recovered Khijjinga but could not fulfill his deream of occupying Sonapur region. <br />Chodagangadeva supported the western Chalukyas against the Chola power in the south but Vikrama Choda succeeded in defeating the combined army of the western Chalukya king Somesvara III and Chodagangadeva. Because of these defeats the political power of Chodaganga declined for sometime. Taking opportunity of that there were rebellions against his authority in different parts of his empire. He, however, succeeded in suppressing the rebellions and in re-establishing his supremacy over the entire territory from the Ganga to the Godavarari by 1135 A.D.<br />Chodagangadeva like his ancestors was a great devotee of Siva. He was, however, found inclined towards Vaishnavism at times. The great Vaishnava, Acharya Ramanuja visited Utkal during his time. It is supposed by scholars that Chodaganga was converted to Vaishnavism by Ramanuja and constructed the temple of Purusottama at Puri under the influence of that Vaishnava Acharya. This, however, appears to be wrong because Ramanuja came to Utkal after 1122 A.D. and the records of Chodaganga after that date indicate that he was more inclined to Saivism then to Vaishnavism. Long before the conquest of Utkal by Chodaganga, Puri (Shrikshetra) was a place of worship of Purusottama and Chodaganga constructed the gigantic temple for the Lord to respect the religious sentiment of the people of the newly conquered territory rather than to obey the dictates of the Vaishnava Acharya Ramanuja. Chodaganga also constructed Vishnu temples at Mukhalingam, Srikakulam and Simhachalam.<br />Chodagangadeva died in 1147 A.D. and was succeeded by his eldest son Kamarnavadeva. The Ganga-Kalachuri war was continuing by that time and Kamarnava was defeated by the Kalachuri king Prithideva II, son and successor of Ratnadeva II. After the death of Kamarnava, the second son of Chodaganga named Raghava became the king in 1158 A.D. During his time poet Jayadeva is known to have composed his famous work Gitagovinda. Raghava died in 1170 A.D. and was succeeded by Rajraj II, the third son of Chodagangadeva. Next ruler was Anangnagabhimadeva II, the fourth and last son of Chodagangadeva. He was the only son of Chodaganga to have a son Rajraj III, who succeeded him after his death in 1198 A.D. During the time of Rajraj III, the Muslim power dominated over northern India from the Punjab to Bengal. Bhaktiyar Khalji, the first Muslim ruler of Bengal sent two Khilji Amins named Mahammed-I-Sheran and Ahmed-I-Sheran against Orissa in 1205 A.D. This was the first Muslim invasion<br />of Orissa. Rajraj III defeated the Sheran brothers and killed many Muslim warriors.<br />Rajraj III died in 1211 A.D. and was succeeded by his son Anangabhimadeva III. During his time Ghiyathu&#146;d-din Iawz, ruler of Bengal, invaded Orissa. Taking advantage of this invasion the Kalachuri king of Tommana also declared war and the age long Ganga-Kalachuri war continued. At this critical time Vishnu,.the General of Angnagabhimadeva III, not only repulsed the invasion of the Muslim but also decisively defeated the Kalachuris on the bank of the Bhima river and near the Vindhya hills. After his victory the Gangas occupied the Sonapur region. Anangabhimadeva III gave his daughter Chandrika in marriage to the Kalachuri prince Paramardideva. By that he could win the friendship of the Kalachuris who were of great strength to the Gangas in their war against the Muslims. Anangabhimadeva was also successful in his work in the south and his empire extended up to the mouth of the Krishna river. Anangabhima was a devout worshipper of Vishnu &#150; Lord Purushottama. At the beginning<br />he was the worshipper of three deities &#150; Purosottama, Rudra and Durga but later on he extensively became a devotee of Purushottama. He dedicated his empire to God Purushottama and declined himself as His deputy.<br />Anangabhimadeva established a new city at the bifurcation of the Mahanadi and the Kathajodi which was called Abhinava Varanasi Kataka. By 1230 A.D. he transferred the headquarters to this new city where he constructed a big temple of Lord Purushottama.<br />Anangabhimadeva III died in 1238 A.D. and was succeeded by his son Narasimhadeva I. By that time Izzu&#146;d-din Tughril Tughan Khan was the Governor of Bengal and had semi-independent status. Narasimhadeva, apprehending danger from him, mobilized his forces against his territory. Izzu&#146;d-din Tughril probably anticipated this attack and in the war that took place he obtained initial victory but subsequently the Muslims were completely defeated with heavy loss. Izzud&#146;d-din himself fled away from the battle to save his life. On his request the Sultan of Delhi sent Qamaru&#146;d-din Tamur Khan, the Governor of Oudh to help the army of Bengal but before the arrival of Oudh army the War at Bengal hnd already ended. The next year (1244 A.D.) Narasimhadeva invaded Bengal for the second time and the Orissan army attacked Lakhnor, the headquarters of Radha, and killed the Muslim commander and a large number of his troops. Quar&#146;d-din Tamur Khan quarreled with the Governor of Bengal at the<br />time the Orissan army plundered the muslim territory. The leader of the Orissan army was Paramardideva, the son-in-law of Anangabhimadeva III, who struck terror among the Muslim forces.<br />The war with Bengal renewed in 1247 A.D. and this time also Paramardideva led the Orissan army and defeated Ikhtiyar Uddin Yuzbak, the newly appointed Governor of Bengal, but after getting assistance from Delhi, Yuzbak made offensive attack and advanced up to Umardan where Paramardideva was killed in the battle in 1255 A.D.<br />Narasimhadeva I was successful in his campaigns against the Muslims and humbled the pride of his enemy. Like his father he was a devotee of Lord Purushottama. He is remembered in history as the builder of the world famous temple at Konarka.<br />In 1264 A.D. Narasimhadeva I was succeeded by his son Bhanudeva I born of queen Sitadevi. During his time Narahari Tirtha the disciple of Ananda Tirtha (Madhdavacharya) had great influence in Orissa. He was even appointed as a Governor of Kalinga. During the rule of Bhanudeva, Chandrikadevi, the daughter of Anangabhimadeva I, constructed the Ananta Basudev temple at Bhubaneswar in 1278 A.D. That year Bhanudeva died and his son Narasimhadeva II was an infant. Narahari Tirtha worked as regent for long twelve years. Narasimhadeva II is known to have fought against the Muslims of Bengal the results of which were indecisive. His long reign from 1278 to 1306 was peaceful and eventless. He was succeeded by his son Bhanudeva II. R.D. Benerji states that one Purushottamadeva ruled Orissa up to 1312 A.D. making Bhanudeva II a prisoner in his palace. This is however not a fact. Purushottamadeva ruled over southern part of Kalinga as a feudatory of Bhanudeva II.<br />In 1321 A.D. Ghiyathu&#146;d-din Tughluq, Sultan of Delhi, sent his son Ulugh Khan against Warangal and Telengana. After defeating these territories Ulugh Khan invaded Orissa. But seeing the organized army under the General of Sri Rama Senapati, Ulugh Khan avoided war. Ghiyathu&#146;d-din Tughluq after reducing Bengal in 1324 marched towards Orissa but was repulsed by Bhanudeva II.<br />Narasimhadeva III succeeded Bhanudeva II in 1328 A.D. Very little information is obtained regarding his political activities. He was succeeded by his son Bhanudeva III in 1352 A.D. In 1353 Shamsud&#146;-din Ilyas Shah invaded Orissa but he retreated after obtaining few elephants. It was by that time that Prince Sangama, the nephew of Bukkaraya I of Vijayanagar, invaded Orissa and defeated Bhanudeva III. As a result of this victory Bukkaraya occupied souther portion of the Ganga kingdom. In 1361 A.D., Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq invaded the Ganga kingdom. He defeated the forces of the Gangas and occupied Varanasi Kataka. Bhanudeva III fled away and took shelter with his family and courtiers in an island probably inside Chilika lake. Sultan Firuz Shah destroyed the temple of Purushottama built by Anangabhimadeva III and disgraced the idols. Bhanudeva III made a treaty with the Sultan by offering twenty big elephants and agreeing to give annual tribute. Thus during Bhanudeva III<br />the prestige and power of the Gangas greatly declined. He died in 1378 A.D. and was succeeded by his son Narasimhadeva IV. During his rule Khwajah-i-Jahan, the Sharqi Sultan of Jaunpur invaded Bengal and Orissa. It was probably a mere raid.<br />By that time the Reddy dynasty in the south became powerful and Anavema Reddy marched up to Simhachalam. In 1381 Sangama II who killed Anavema Reddy also overran the Ganga kingdom up to Simhachalam. Narasimhadeva IV was further defeated by Kumaragiri Reddy twice in 1391 and 1398. Inspite of these defeats Narasimhadeva continued his hold over South Kalinga. At the beginning of the 15 th century A.D. there were civil wars in the Reddy kingdom, taking advantage of which Narasimhadeva organized the southern part of his territory against future danger from the side of the Reddys. Narasimhadeva IV was a devout worshipper of Siva but he was also a devotee of Purushottama.<br />He was succeeded by his son Bhanudeva IV in 1414 A.D. Ibrahim Shah, the Sharqi Sultan of Jaunpur invaded Orissa many times to obtain elephants. He was, however, subsequently defeated by Hussang Ghori, the Sultan of Malwa. It is said that Hussang Ghori came to Orissa in the guise of a horse dealer and captured Bhanudeva IV as a result of which Bhanudeva had to present him a number of elephants and purchased his release. This account, however, appears to be fictitious.<br />Bhanudeva IV was a weak and imbecile ruler. In 1435 he went to the South to fight against the Reddy power taking advantage of which Kapileswara Routray, the General, seized the throne and founded the rule of his own dynasty.<br />The Suryavamsi<br />Kapilendradeva belonged to the Solar dynasty. His ancestors were feudatory Chiefs under the Gangas. When he usurped the throne in 1435 A.D. many feudatory Chiefs challenged his authority. At the time of this internal danger Sultan Ahmed Shah of Bengal invaded Orissa but he was defeated by Minister Gopinath Mahapatra while Kapilendradeva suppressed the internal rebellion with strong hands. By 1443 A.D., Kapilendradeva succeeded in consolidating his power over the newly acquired kingdom but in 1444 he had to fight against the combined army of the Reddy of Rajamundry and king Devaraya II of Vijayanagar who invaded the southern part of his territory. Just by that time Mahamud shah, the Sharqui Sultan of Jaunpur invaded from the north. Faced with these two invasions Kapilendradeva gave his wholehearted attention to drive out Muslims from the north neglecting the south. Mahamud Shah was defeated and retreated from northern Orissa after which Hamvira, the son of Kapilendra,<br />fought against the Reddy&#146;s of Rajahmundry and scored a victory over them. Mallikarjuna, the successor of Devaraya II, the king of Vikayanagar, could not come to the rescue of the Reddys&#146; Hamvira, the son of Kapilendradeva, marched against Vijayanagar and defeated the forces of Mallikarjuna. By 1454 the whole of Kondavidu territory came under the possession of the army led by Hamvira. Udayagiri and Chandragiri, the two important territories, were occupied in 1460 and 1464 respectively. Thus Kapilendradeva could occupy almost the entire seaboard of Vijayanagar up to the Kaveri. Dakshina Kapilesvara, his grandson, was appointed as the Parichha of the newly conquered territory.<br />In 1448 Hamvira defeated the Bahmany Sultan Allauddin II after which this Sultan had friendly relation with Orissa. In 1457 Sultan Allauddin II helped Kapilendradeva in defeating Mahmad Khalji, the Sultan of Malwa. After the death of Allauddin II his son Humayun Shah invaded Debarkonda, the Chief of which sought help from Kapilendradeva. Hamviradeva defeated the Bahmany forces in 1459 as a result of which Telengana was occupied by Kapilendradeva and the Velama Chief of Debarkonda became his subordinate. In 1461 Humayun Shah was succeeded by his minor son Nizam Shah taking advantage of which Kapilendradeva invaded the Bahmany kingdom but by that time the Sharqi Sultan Hussan Shah invaded Orissa from the north and Kapilendradeva had to fight with him withdrawing his army from the south. Consequently the young Nizam Shah achieved victory over the enemies. After driving out the Sharqui Sultan from the north Kapilendradeva invaded the Bahmany kingdom and conquered Vidar and<br />other important strongholds.<br />The last days of Kapilendra were not peaceful. His entire career was spent in wars and he acquired many enemies both inside and outside his kingdom. He chose Purushottam, his youngest son, to be his successor. So his heroic son Hamvira revolted against him. Kapilendradeva was a great devotee of Jagannath and constructed the outer walls of Jagannath temple. He died in 1468.<br />After the death of Kapilendradeva his son Purushottam born of a Brahmin lady called Parvatidevi succeeded to the throne. Hamaviradeva, the eldest son, could not accept the rule of Purushottam and revolted against him. The civil war continued for two years and when Hamvira was unable to defeat Purushottam who had popular support and the State resources at his command, he sought the help of Bahmany Sultan who deputed Hussan Bheiry to support Hamvira. In 1472 Hamvira with the support of Hussan Bheiry defeated Purushottam and occupied the throne. He gave Kondapalli and Rajahmundry to the Bahmany Sultan in return of his help. But Purushottam later on defeated Hamvira in 1476 and re-occupied the throne. A treaty was concluded between the two brothers according to which Hamvira was given the Khemundi territory to rule as a feudatory.<br />` After becoming king, Purushottam tried to get back Kondapalli and Rajahmundry from the Bahmany Sultan. He also tried to occupy the territory snatched away by Saluva Narasimha during the civil war. Purushottamdeva with a view to restore the lost territory mobilized his army against Sultan Mahmad Shah III Bahmany. He besieged Rajahmundry but without fighting any battle made an alliance with the Sultan. After that the relation between Bahmany and Vijayanagar became very bitter and stray battles took place between the forces of these two kingdoms. In 1481 Sultan Mahammad died and was succeeded by his young son Mahmad Shah. When the Bahmany kingdom was in chaotic condition Purushottam mobilised his forces and occupied Rajahmundry and Kondapalli. He further sent his army to occupy Udayagiri which had been taken away by Saluva Narasimha. Udayagiri was occupied and Saluva Narasimha was taken captive. Thus Purushottam could restore his power and glory during his last days and<br />then devoted his attention for promotion or religion and culture. He died in 1497 A.D. and was succeeded by his son Prataprudradeva.</p>

<p>Dear Dr. Sri, Uma &amp; Gokul,</p>
<p>Our group upon having established very good contacts with Tamil <br />Sangam Delhi, Mumbai and now Orissa, can plan Zonal activities - <br />identifying active participants in North Zone (Delhi), East (Orisa), <br />West (Mumbai) and South Zone (Chennai - Bangalore).</p>
<p>We have established an ad-hoc committee in the name of <br />Ponniyinselvan Varalatru Peravai (<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym ). With four zones, we will <br />examine possibility of registering this using 4 offices and then <br />expand to Overseas operations as well.</acronym></p>
<p>P S V P will be a bonding factor for all of us and a member of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  <br />group will be deemed to be a member of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan Varalaatru Pervai" PSVP</acronym . Will go into earlier <br />mails and re-draft contour of activities.</acronym></acronym></p>
