<p>Bhuvana sagodhari, thank you. I agree with you on why<br />people do not like <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  is a little beyond me too.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell you one thing though, enakku sila<br />samayam kashtamaga irukku, educated ladies thinking<br />some characters are great like vanavan madhevi. A lady<br />in any time who wants to allow her husband to be with<br />someone else...adhulla ennanga periya perumai???<br />Sivakami was not a historical figure so whether the<br />real vanavam madhevi was like that or not is not<br />really an issue. And Kalki many times wrote to cater<br />to audience taste of his time. Why did he not allow<br />Sivakami to think like that? To be a second wife to<br />Narasimha after he was married? No, she was too<br />dignified and proud to become that way and I find it<br />easy to respect her for that.</p>
<p>Munnam avan naamam kettal patri neengal solvadhu<br />mutrilum sariye....sorry if I hurt your sentiments but<br />I just wanted to share some thoughts, that is all.</p>

<p>hi all,</p>
<p>i've not participated in many of ur discussions ..but<br />read everything..</p>
<p>i couldn't get why people don't like(0r not that<br />interested to read) <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym ...</p>
<p>it is one of the greatest novel of kalki..</p>
<p>vanmadevi's character will be wonderfully portrayed by<br />kalki..indeed the character's explanation will be<br />given in one chapter that worth the novel....her<br />affection towards narashimapallavan. ..her magnanimity<br />towards sivakami, to even giveup her princess<br />position,from her character kalki means to say how a<br />wife should be...though there are many other<br />characters.. .i've strong bond towards vanamadevi.. .<br />And also in the song "munnam avanudaya nammam kettal "<br />from thiruvarur thandagam..i bet u can never find<br />anyother song like that which depicts thalaivi's<br />kathal especially the line "annaiyum atthanayum andre<br />neethal ,agandral agalidathar, asarathai thanai<br />maranthal than namam kettal thalaipattal nagai<br />thalaivan thale"... i firmly believe <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  is one of the<br />greatest literary work of kalki...</acronym></p>

        <p>Dear vijay<br />Thank you very much about the detailed history of the indra haram and mani makudam. <br />It is true that every kingdom has such property. Pandyain kingdom was no exception. I agreed that pandiyan kingdom was also having such royal property. <br />I am just telling the various interesting stories about indraharam manimakudam or senkol. These stories are much interesting and many may not exactly equivalent to the history. For example what is the evidence that only indran has given the malai to pandyas?. <br />However these stories about indra haram mani makudam or senkol are much interesting and liked by many readers including me.<br />I will enclose my story for members in next mail<br />thank you<br />yours faithfully,<br />lkailasam </p>

<p>Hi sir</p>
<p>with all due respects, the pandia haram is indeed one of the <br />greatest REAL things to be discussed - we just recently two weeks <br />back read about the same being referred to as early as in <br />silapadigaram. (B)</p>
<p>the diadem( crown jewel) finds mention in the mahavamsa (A) below - <br />the buddhist chronicles of srilanka ( for the sake of argument - <br />cross reference from the other side)</p>
<p>the meeikirthi of rajendra sings his praise for bringing this back...</p>
<p>Tirumalai Rock inscription(2) of Rajendra <br />having seized the crown of the king of Ilam (on) the<br />tempestuous ocean; the exceedingly fine crowns of the<br />queens of that (king); the beautiful crown and the<br />necklace of Indra, which the king of the South (i.e.<br />the Pandya) had previously deposited with that (king<br />of Ilam); the whole Ila-mandala (on) the transparent<br />sea."</p>
<p>A) </p>
<p>quoting from the<br />Mahavamsam account( srilanka)</p>
<p>During the reign of Dappula V (918-930), a Pandya<br />king came to Ceylon to ask for Dappula's help<br />against the Colas. Since the assistance was refused<br />he betook himself to the Kerala country, leaving his<br />diadem in Ceylon (Mahav. 53, 5ff). Under king Udaya<br />II (942-950) a Cola king sent his army to Ceylon to<br />fetch the Pandya crown (Mahav, 53, 40ff.) But<br />although the Colas were victorious in battle and<br />conquered the northern provinces, Udaya succeeded in<br />escaping to Rohana with the crown and other<br />treasures. The victorious Cola king was no doubt<br />again Parantaka I (907-947), mentioned above, for he<br />calls himself in his latest inscriptions conqueror of<br />Ilam i.e, Ceylon.(1)</p>
<p>A diadem (from the Greek 'diadema' from 'diadeo' to bind round, or<br />fasten) was originally a white ribbon, ending in a knot and two<br />strips that were placed often on the shoulders, that surrounded the<br />head of the king to denote his authority.By extension, this term was<br />applied later to a crown, generally with a circular shape.</p>
<p>(Author?&#128;&#153;s Note: Chola inscriptions found in India by King Rajendra<br />Chola indicates Pandu King<br />fled to Lanka and left the diadem in Lanka. It further states that<br />he brought back the diadem from<br />Lanka.</p>
<p>Udaya IV: (955 AD ?&#128;" 964 AD)<br />After Sena, Udaya became the King.<br />Chola Attack:<br />During King Udaya?&#128;&#153;s time, Chola King, sent messengers demanding the<br />diadem left by the Pandu<br />King. King Udaya refused to send the diadem to the Chola King. Chola<br />King sent a huge army and<br />defeated King Udaya?&#128;&#153;s army. King Udaya fled to Rohana.</p>
<p>In A.D. 981 the weak king Mahinda V ascended the<br />throne of Ceylon. Since he was unable to pay them,<br />tile Kerala and other mercenaries rebelled. Mahinda<br />fled to Rohana, but in Northern Ceylon the<br />mercenaries carried on a military dictatorship. The<br />Cola king, turning the confusion in Ceylon to his own<br />advantage, sent troops to tile island (Mahav. 55, 14<br />ff.). The Colas advanced on Rohana, captured the king<br />and the queen alive and brought them with all their<br />treasures to India. This took place in the 36th year<br />of Mahinda's reign, i.e. A.D. 1017,</p>

<p>wow vairam,</p>
<p>Nice one - and see the link to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  - the line below</p>
<p>"<br />It blows through the palace of great Pandya king,who wears on his<br />broad chest a chain of gold that the king of the gods once gave him"</p>
<p>this is the royal diadem - pandya haram - king of gods ( indra??)<br />indra haramum - so this was well known even during the<br />silapathigaram days .....true to its claim..... in whose pursuit<br />arulmozhi goes to lanka - which is finally retrived by rajendra -<br />and sung its praise in his meeikirthi.</p>

<p>mahinda V - year of ascession - AD 981<br />as per mahavamsa accounts he ruled for 36 years...AD 1017.<br />the mahavamsa clearly states that the king and queen were captured <br />and brought back to india with all their treasures...</p>
<p>this is an abstract from the mahavamsa...</p>
<p>In A.D. 981 the weak king Mahinda V ascended the<br />throne of Ceylon. Since he was unable to pay them,<br />tile Kerala and other mercenaries rebelled. Mahinda<br />fled to Rohana, but in Northern Ceylon the<br />mercenaries carried on a military dictatorship. The<br />Cola king, turning the confusion in Ceylon to his own<br />advantage, sent troops to tile island (Mahav. 55, 14<br />ff.). The Colas advanced on Rohana, captured the king<br />and the queen alive and brought them with all their<br />treasures to India. This took place in the 36th year<br />of Mahinda's reign, i.e. A.D. 1017,</p></vj.episteme@...></p>

<p>hi venkat</p>
<p>whatever your reason, we would always argue - but then indirectly you <br />are meaning that <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym 's claim to fame was actually a sham - his <br />prasithi is boasting!. when we do have such cases of contradicting <br />info - for eg of even <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  conquest of rattapadi - from inscriptions of <br />the other side - similar pulikesi's inscriptions on the conqest of <br />kanchi (<acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym ) ....but in that case are your doubting <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym 's ganges <br />campaign ( maybe he just went on a teertha yarta), his overseas <br />maritime exploits....only proof again for this is his prasithi. but <br />now even experts this side are agreeing that this was a fact.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>you say versions from the pandya side... lets see what you have. such <br />a jewel of such immense respect and awe - when for eg sundara pandya <br />when he wrecks havoc on uraiyur and tanjore - the now famous ploughing <br />with donkey etc - if he had retrived the haram, he must have put it as <br />a crowning accomplishment - but cant find...</p>

        <p>Hi Vijay<br />the entire kaviri maindhan takes place during uthama's period.</p>
<p>half way thro the research for the novel i was convinced by quite a <br />few factors mainly the pandya version that the cholas never laid <br />their hands on it or something to that sort.<br />there also existed a possibility that there could have been more than <br />one set.<br />the rest was as you say the imaginative licence.<br />of course i have a chapter when every one feels te pandya jewels <br />after being found are quite unlucky and the PM wants it inside a box <br />for some future king to use when needed.something like the l;ast <br />scene in raiders of the lost ark.<br />if you notice well enough loka- the name was actually chosen because <br />it sounded better. actually rajendran's favourite step mother was  <br />panchavan madevi. ( another recent book as mentioned her as a temple <br />dancer and I did not want to evoke those memories in the reader)<br />so you may consider her a part of fiction too.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>That is a great account. Waiting to hear from you more.</p>
<p>=====Quote====<br />There is no mention of it being found in uttama times ( dont<br />remember venkat mentioning so in KM). <br />====Unquote===</p>
<p>Oh no! Even I am not saying that Venketesh, verbally said so. <br />According to Kaviri Mainthan, the finding of the haram and <br />maNimakudam<br />by KandamaRan, along with Loka, happens while Utthama Choza was <br />ruling. That is why I said so.</p>
<p>Venketesh,</p>
<p>I am not arguing here. But I would be definitely interested on your <br />comments as to how you chose to protray KandamaRan to have found it. </p>

<p>  Hi venkatesh,</p>
<p>  on kandamaran finding it - you can argue that with the author of <br />  kaveri mainthan ( our) venkatesh. if you read vengaiyin mainthan <br />the <br />  author akilan would have his hero elango credited with finding the <br />  haram ( interesting account of a lake being guarded by a huge <br />  crocodile and here too the hero is assisted or directed by his <br />lady <br />  love....in this case the lankan beauty ...)</p>
<p>  There is no mention of it being found in uttama times ( dont <br />  remember venkat mentioning so in KM). infact during uttama times - <br />  there seems to general stoppage of all external aggression - that <br />is <br />  what we can gather from the inscriptions - mostly temple building <br />  attributed to uttama's mother sembian madevi....</p>
<p>  it was only after arulmozhi takes over the reigns that the <br />overseas <br />  conquests start. and as far as i know, as per inscriptional and <br />  other evidences cited above - the indira haram was retrived during <br />  rajendra's times - if you want to know how we can be so sure - the <br />  finding of the diadem is linked to rajendra obtaining the crown <br />  jewels of elam ( lanka) and the capture and restraining of the <br />  lankan king mahinda in a palace in madurai for 12 years.</p>
<p>  i had posted such under an another post some time back</p>
<p>  Below is from Historical inscriptions of south india: sit back and<br />  enjoy the amount of work that went into interwining fact with<br />  fiction to give PS its timeless allure:</p>
<p>  [A.D. c. 916-17. The reign of Kassapa V, king of Ceylon, came to an<br />  end, according to Hultzsch's revised chronology, in A.D. 916, or<br />  perhaps 917. His successors reigned only seven months, and then<br />  Dappula V obtained the throne in 917. Shortly before the death of<br />  Kassapa V, we are told in the Mahavamsa (ch. 1ii), the Pandya king,<br />  Rajasimha III, sent many presents to, and begged aid from Kassapa<br />  against the Cholas who had seized his country in or before A.D. <br />909.<br />  Kassapa sent over to the mainland an army to his assistance.<br />  Rajasimha led both armies against</p>
<p>  Parantaka's troops but was defeated and retired leaving the<br />  singhalese to carry on the war alone.But their army was attacked by<br />  disease and their general died from it, and they returned to <br />Ceylon.</p>
<p>  Dappula V having become king of the island, Rajasimha, driven to<br />  desperation, crossed over to Ceylon, and the two kings prepared for<br />  a fresh war against the Cholas. But owing to grave internal<br />  disturbances Dappula had to abandon the enterprise. And the Pandya<br />  king fled to the Kerala country, leaving his crown and other<br />  apparel ' in Ceylon. This event may have taken place in A.D. 917-<br />18.<br />  Amongst the apparel was ' the necklace of Indra ', as we learn from<br />  the story of what took place later. (Mahawamsa, ch. 1iii )</p>
<p>  This was the second war with Ceylon of Parantaka I, who then <br />assumed<br />  the title ' Samagrama Raghava.</p>
<p>  [A;D. 952. King Mahindu IV of Ceylon came to the throne in this<br />  year according to Dr. Hultzsch's Singhalese chronology. He was<br />  attacked by an army sent from the Tamil country by .a king whom the<br />  Mahavamsa, calls the ''chola-Vallabha?.* It Is not known 'to<br />  whom this refers. ' Vallabha 'is a Chalukya title. The Chola kings<br />  of the time of Mahinda IV (A.D. 952-968) were Gangaraditya and<br />  Arinijaya. (Mahavamsa, ch. 1 iv]</p>
<p>  This was the first year of Parantaka Chola II, alias Sundara ChSla,<br />  Rajakesarivarman. Two of his queens are named, one being a Chera<br />  princess who lived till 1012. He had a general named siriya-<br />  Velar, who was killed in Ceylon in the king's ninth year (see 116 <br />of<br />  1895). This would be in A.D. 963-64, during the reign of Mahindu <br />IV,<br />  king of Ceylon, and the war in which he lost his life would be the<br />  same as is referred to above (s. v., A. D. 952).</p>

If any body is unable to get the story kindly <br />  inform me i will give the same<br />    yours<br />    lkailasam</p>
<p>  Hi sir</p>
<p>  with all due respects, the pandia haram is indeed one of the <br />  greatest REAL things to be discussed - we just recently two weeks <br />  back read about the same being referred to as early as in <br />  silapadigaram. (B)</p>
<p>  the diadem( crown jewel) finds mention in the mahavamsa (A) below -</p>
<p>  the buddhist chronicles of srilanka ( for the sake of argument - <br />  cross reference from the other side)</p>
<p>  the meeikirthi of rajendra sings his praise for bringing this <br />back...</p>
<p>  Tirumalai Rock inscription(2) of Rajendra <br />  having seized the crown of the king of Ilam (on) the<br />  tempestuous ocean; the exceedingly fine crowns of the<br />  queens of that (king); the beautiful crown and the<br />  necklace of Indra, which the king of the South (i.e.<br />  the Pandya) had previously deposited with that (king<br />  of Ilam); the whole Ila-mandala (on) the transparent<br />  sea."</p>
<p>  A) </p>
<p>  quoting from the<br />  Mahavamsam account( srilanka)</p>
<p>  During the reign of Dappula V (918-930), a Pandya<br />  king came to Ceylon to ask for Dappula's help<br />  against the Colas. Since the assistance was refused<br />  he betook himself to the Kerala country, leaving his<br />  diadem in Ceylon (Mahav. 53, 5ff). Under king Udaya<br />  II (942-950) a Cola king sent his army to Ceylon to<br />  fetch the Pandya crown (Mahav, 53, 40ff.) But<br />  although the Colas were victorious in battle and<br />  conquered the northern provinces, Udaya succeeded in<br />  escaping to Rohana with the crown and other<br />  treasures. The victorious Cola king was no doubt<br />  again Parantaka I (907-947), mentioned above, for he<br />  calls himself in his latest inscriptions conqueror of<br />  Ilam i.e, Ceylon.(1)</p>
<p>  A diadem (from the Greek 'diadema' from 'diadeo' to bind round, or<br />  fasten) was originally a white ribbon, ending in a knot and two<br />  strips that were placed often on the shoulders, that surrounded the<br />  head of the king to denote his authority.By extension, this term <br />was<br />  applied later to a crown, generally with a circular shape.</p>
<p>  (Author’s Note: Chola inscriptions found in India by King <br />Rajendra<br />  Chola indicates Pandu King<br />  fled to Lanka and left the diadem in Lanka. It further states that<br />  he brought back the diadem from<br />  Lanka.</p>
<p>  Udaya IV: (955 AD ??" 964 AD)<br />  After Sena, Udaya became the King.<br />  Chola Attack:<br />  During King Udaya’s time, Chola King, sent messengers demanding <br />the<br />  diadem left by the Pandu<br />  King. King Udaya refused to send the diadem to the Chola King. <br />Chola<br />  King sent a huge army and<br />  defeated King Udaya’s army. King Udaya fled to Rohana.</p>
<p>  In A.D. 981 the weak king Mahinda V ascended the<br />  throne of Ceylon. Since he was unable to pay them,<br />  tile Kerala and other mercenaries rebelled. Mahinda<br />  fled to Rohana, but in Northern Ceylon the<br />  mercenaries carried on a military dictatorship. The<br />  Cola king, turning the confusion in Ceylon to his own<br />  advantage, sent troops to tile island (Mahav. 55, 14<br />  ff.). The Colas advanced on Rohana, captured the king<br />  and the queen alive and brought them with all their<br />  treasures to India. This took place in the 36th year<br />  of Mahinda's reign, i.e. A.D. 1017,</p>

<p>  wow vairam,</p>
<p>  Nice one - and see the link to PS - the line below</p>
<p>  "<br />  It blows through the palace of great Pandya king,who wears on his<br />  broad chest a chain of gold that the king of the gods once gave <br />him"</p>
<p>  this is the royal diadem - pandya haram - king of gods ( indra??)<br />  indra haramum - so this was well known even during the<br />  silapathigaram days .....true to its claim..... in whose pursuit<br />  arulmozhi goes to lanka - which is finally retrived by rajendra -<br />  and sung its praise in his meeikirthi.</p>

<p>  Hi sir</p>
<p>  with all due respects, the pandia haram is indeed one of the <br />  greatest REAL things to be discussed - we just recently two weeks <br />  back read about the same being referred to as early as in <br />  silapadigaram. (B)</p>
<p>  the diadem( crown jewel) finds mention in the mahavamsa (A) below -</p>
<p>  the buddhist chronicles of srilanka ( for the sake of argument - <br />  cross reference from the other side)</p>
<p>  the meeikirthi of rajendra sings his praise for bringing this <br />back...</p>
<p>  Tirumalai Rock inscription(2) of Rajendra <br />  having seized the crown of the king of Ilam (on) the<br />  tempestuous ocean; the exceedingly fine crowns of the<br />  queens of that (king); the beautiful crown and the<br />  necklace of Indra, which the king of the South (i.e.<br />  the Pandya) had previously deposited with that (king<br />  of Ilam); the whole Ila-mandala (on) the transparent<br />  sea."</p>
<p>  A) </p>
<p>  quoting from the<br />  Mahavamsam account( srilanka)</p>
<p>  During the reign of Dappula V (918-930), a Pandya<br />  king came to Ceylon to ask for Dappula's help<br />  against the Colas. Since the assistance was refused<br />  he betook himself to the Kerala country, leaving his<br />  diadem in Ceylon (Mahav. 53, 5ff). Under king Udaya<br />  II (942-950) a Cola king sent his army to Ceylon to<br />  fetch the Pandya crown (Mahav, 53, 40ff.) But<br />  although the Colas were victorious in battle and<br />  conquered the northern provinces, Udaya succeeded in<br />  escaping to Rohana with the crown and other<br />  treasures. The victorious Cola king was no doubt<br />  again Parantaka I (907-947), mentioned above, for he<br />  calls himself in his latest inscriptions conqueror of<br />  Ilam i.e, Ceylon.(1)</p>
<p>  A diadem (from the Greek 'diadema' from 'diadeo' to bind round, or<br />  fasten) was originally a white ribbon, ending in a knot and two<br />  strips that were placed often on the shoulders, that surrounded the<br />  head of the king to denote his authority.By extension, this term <br />was<br />  applied later to a crown, generally with a circular shape.</p>
<p>  (Author’s Note: Chola inscriptions found in India by King Rajendra<br />  Chola indicates Pandu King<br />  fled to Lanka and left the diadem in Lanka. It further states that<br />  he brought back the diadem from<br />  Lanka.</p>
<p>  Udaya IV: (955 AD …quot; 964 AD)<br />  After Sena, Udaya became the King.<br />  Chola Attack:<br />  During King Udaya’s time, Chola King, sent messengers demanding the<br />  diadem left by the Pandu<br />  King. King Udaya refused to send the diadem to the Chola King. <br />Chola<br />  King sent a huge army and<br />  defeated King Udaya’s army. King Udaya fled to Rohana.</p>
<p>  In A.D. 981 the weak king Mahinda V ascended the<br />  throne of Ceylon. Since he was unable to pay them,<br />  tile Kerala and other mercenaries rebelled. Mahinda<br />  fled to Rohana, but in Northern Ceylon the<br />  mercenaries carried on a military dictatorship. The<br />  Cola king, turning the confusion in Ceylon to his own<br />  advantage, sent troops to tile island (Mahav. 55, 14<br />  ff.). The Colas advanced on Rohana, captured the king<br />  and the queen alive and brought them with all their<br />  treasures to India. This took place in the 36th year<br />  of Mahinda's reign, i.e. A.D. 1017,</p>
<p>  B)</p>

<p>  wow vairam,</p>
<p>  Nice one - and see the link to PS - the line below</p>
<p>  "<br />  It blows through the palace of great Pandya king,who wears on his<br />  broad chest a chain of gold that the king of the gods once gave <br />him"</p>
<p>  this is the royal diadem - pandya haram - king of gods ( indra??)<br />  indra haramum - so this was well known even during the<br />  silapathigaram days .....true to its claim..... in whose pursuit<br />  arulmozhi goes to lanka - which is finally retrived by rajendra -<br />  and sung its praise in his meeikirthi.</p>
