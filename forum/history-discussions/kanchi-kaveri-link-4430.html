<p>Dear nandakumar selvaraj/sps</p>
<p>sending here with information on </p>
<p>kanchi kaveri link</p>
<p>It seems that at 1487 King of Puri, Purusottama Dev, was to marry a <br />princess padmavati who was the daughter of a king, Maharaja Salluva <br />Narasingha, from the kingdom of Kanchi. When the Ratha-Yatra <br />festival was to take place, the father of the princess was invited, <br />but sent his minister Chinnubhatta Godaranga instead. </p>
<p>When he attended, the King of Puri performed the devotional <br />tradition of sweeping the road in front of the carts. The visiting <br />minister, however, rather than being impressed with the devotion of <br />the King for Lord Jagannatha, did not approve of him sweeping the <br />road, even if it was for the Lord.</p>
<p>When he reported this to King Salluva Narasingha, the king objected <br />to the idea of his daughter marrying the King of Puri since he was <br />merely a street sweeper. </p>
<p>Purusottama Dev was extremely angry that he, as the servant of Lord <br />Jagannatha, would be insulted for his service like that. So he <br />gathered his troupes and went to Kanchi to teach King Salluva a <br />lesson. Unfortunately, King Purusottama Dev was badly defeated by a <br />massive bee formation from the trunk of vadabi ganesh ,soldiers <br />unable to fight with the saluva troup. </p>
<p>On returning to Puri in such a downcast mood, he stopped at the <br />simple cottage of Saikatacharya, a great ascetic, householder <br />devotee of Lord Jagannatha. </p>
<p>This devotee pointed out that the King had forgotten to ask <br />permission from Lord Jagannatha before he went to attack King <br />Sallwo. With this realization, the King returned to Puri and visited <br />the temple of the Lord, crying over his defeat, asking why the Lord <br />had let this happen. He spent the night in the temple, and with <br />doors closed, before the night came to an end, the King heard a <br />voice asking why he was so distraught over such a simple thing. The <br />voice said to go gather his troupes again, and that we two brothers, <br />Jagannatha and Balarama, would go along to fight on the King's <br />behalf. As the news spread, many people, both old and young, joined <br />the King's forces to fight with Their Lordships. However, as they <br />went, the King was filled with some doubts whether Their Lordships <br />were really going with him. </p>
<p>While the King and his army went onward, far ahead were two soldiers <br />that rode on one black horse and one white horse. They stopped to <br />quench Their thirst at a small village near Chilika Lake by buying <br />some yogurt from a devotee named Manika. </p>
<p>She offered Them yogurt, but when she asked for payment, they said <br />They had no money. Instead They gave her a jeweled ring and told her <br />to give it to King Purusottama Dev, who would then give her payment. </p>
<p>After some time, the King caught up to the lady, who flagged him <br />down to give him the ring and asked for payment for the soldiers' <br />drink. The king was shocked to see the ratnamudrika ring of Lord <br />Jagannatha and then regained his confidence that, indeed, Their <br />Lordships had certainly come with him. In payment for the ring, the <br />king gave her the whole village, which is still named Manikapatna. </p>
<p>After this the king and his troupes were victorious over King <br />Sallwo, and he also took King Sallwo's daughter as well. </p>
<p>However, he did not marry her after the insult her father had given <br />him. He instructed his minister to see that she get married to a <br />qualified sweeper.</p>
<p>After one year, at the next Ratha-Yatra, the King again performed <br />his sweeping ceremony. At that time, the king's minister announced <br />that the king was the most qualified sweeper, since he swept for <br />Lord Jagannatha, and that the princess, Padmavati, should marry him. </p>
<p>Then Maharaja Purusottama Dev married the princess and she later <br />gave birth to a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, who became known as <br />King Prataparudra. Anyway, at some point after this, the King of <br />Puri discontinued sweeping the streets and now sweeps the carts. </p>
<p>still vadaabi ganesh is at puri jagannath mandir front gate people <br />are worshipping him as a prisonar of jagannath.</p>
<p>as what i told this ganesh was brought by narshimma pallava from <br />vaddabi.</p>
<p>as per the myth of puri vadabi ganesh was brought as a victory <br />against kanchi after the war.</p>
<p>even 2nd pulikesi was controlling orissa some years,his <br />contemoporary were harshavardhan and sasanka gouda.</p>
<p>There was a severe war for capturing palur port those days.</p>
<p>during suryavamsi period </p>
<p>till cavery was ruled by orissa king hamivera mahapatra brother of <br />puroshtma dev for a period of 7 years</p>

<p>Dear nandakumar selvaraj/sps</p>
<p>sending here with information on </p>
<p>kanchi kaveri link</p>
<p>It seems that at 1487 King of Puri, Purusottama Dev, was to marry a <br />princess padmavati who was the daughter of a king, Maharaja Salluva <br />Narasingha, from the kingdom of Kanchi. When the Ratha-Yatra <br />festival was to take place, the father of the princess was invited, <br />but sent his minister Chinnubhatta Godaranga instead. </p>
<p>When he attended, the King of Puri performed the devotional <br />tradition of sweeping the road in front of the carts. The visiting <br />minister, however, rather than being impressed with the devotion of <br />the King for Lord Jagannatha, did not approve of him sweeping the <br />road, even if it was for the Lord.</p>
<p>When he reported this to King Salluva Narasingha, the king objected <br />to the idea of his daughter marrying the King of Puri since he was <br />merely a street sweeper. </p>
<p>Purusottama Dev was extremely angry that he, as the servant of Lord <br />Jagannatha, would be insulted for his service like that. So he <br />gathered his troupes and went to Kanchi to teach King Salluva a <br />lesson. Unfortunately, King Purusottama Dev was badly defeated by a <br />massive bee formation from the trunk of vadabi ganesh ,soldiers <br />unable to fight with the saluva troup. </p>
<p>On returning to Puri in such a downcast mood, he stopped at the <br />simple cottage of Saikatacharya, a great ascetic, householder <br />devotee of Lord Jagannatha. </p>
<p>This devotee pointed out that the King had forgotten to ask <br />permission from Lord Jagannatha before he went to attack King <br />Sallwo. With this realization, the King returned to Puri and visited <br />the temple of the Lord, crying over his defeat, asking why the Lord <br />had let this happen. He spent the night in the temple, and with <br />doors closed, before the night came to an end, the King heard a <br />voice asking why he was so distraught over such a simple thing. The <br />voice said to go gather his troupes again, and that we two brothers, <br />Jagannatha and Balarama, would go along to fight on the King's <br />behalf. As the news spread, many people, both old and young, joined <br />the King's forces to fight with Their Lordships. However, as they <br />went, the King was filled with some doubts whether Their Lordships <br />were really going with him. </p>
<p>While the King and his army went onward, far ahead were two soldiers <br />that rode on one black horse and one white horse. They stopped to <br />quench Their thirst at a small village near Chilika Lake by buying <br />some yogurt from a devotee named Manika. </p>
<p>She offered Them yogurt, but when she asked for payment, they said <br />They had no money. Instead They gave her a jeweled ring and told her <br />to give it to King Purusottama Dev, who would then give her payment. </p>
<p>After some time, the King caught up to the lady, who flagged him <br />down to give him the ring and asked for payment for the soldiers' <br />drink. The king was shocked to see the ratnamudrika ring of Lord <br />Jagannatha and then regained his confidence that, indeed, Their <br />Lordships had certainly come with him. In payment for the ring, the <br />king gave her the whole village, which is still named Manikapatna. </p>
<p>After this the king and his troupes were victorious over King <br />Sallwo, and he also took King Sallwo's daughter as well. </p>
<p>However, he did not marry her after the insult her father had given <br />him. He instructed his minister to see that she get married to a <br />qualified sweeper.</p>
<p>After one year, at the next Ratha-Yatra, the King again performed <br />his sweeping ceremony. At that time, the king's minister announced <br />that the king was the most qualified sweeper, since he swept for <br />Lord Jagannatha, and that the princess, Padmavati, should marry him. </p>
<p>Then Maharaja Purusottama Dev married the princess and she later <br />gave birth to a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, who became known as <br />King Prataparudra. Anyway, at some point after this, the King of <br />Puri discontinued sweeping the streets and now sweeps the carts. </p>
<p>still vadaabi ganesh is at puri jagannath mandir front gate people <br />are worshipping him as a prisonar of jagannath.</p>
<p>as what i told this ganesh was brought by narshimma pallava from <br />vaddabi.</p>
<p>as per the myth of puri vadabi ganesh was brought as a victory <br />against kanchi after the war.</p>
<p>even 2nd pulikesi was controlling orissa some years,his <br />contemoporary were harshavardhan and sasanka gouda.</p>
<p>There was a severe war for capturing palur port those days.</p>
<p>during suryavamsi period </p>
<p>till cavery was ruled by orissa king hamivera mahapatra brother of <br />puroshtma dev for a period of 7 years</p>

        <p>Beautiful account, Bala ! I was shocked when you concluded that the<br />two were parants of chaitanya mahaprabhu !</p>
<p>There is something most interesting about puri jagannatha. Every 12<br />years or so, the wooden deities are demolished and new deities are<br />installed in puri.</p>
<p>During this process, a specific person from a designated family locks<br />himself in a room and transfers some holy contents from the present<br />moorthies to the new images. He ties his eyes with cloth so that he<br />does not see these contents. There was a very detailed article in week<br />long back on these traditions - even the selection of tree out of<br />which new images are made is a very elaborate process</p>
<p>By the way, puri is one rare example of main moorthies being made out<br />of wood. Aagamas recognize wood as one of the possible substances out<br />of which the deities can be constructed - But we do not have many<br />examples. Thirukkovilur ulagalanthan is the only exception in south india.</p>
