<p>As far as I know British are good for uniting/building<br />India.</p>
<p>Politicians are rubbish systematically killed good<br />governance left by British.</p>
<p>I remember one bridge collapsed during 1997-1999 near<br />Chennai on east coast road constructed at that time.<br />The comedy was authorities tried to demolish(by<br />blasting) old bridge built by British didn't collpase<br />but due to impact on the new bridge completely fallen.</p>
<p>The whole day I was unable to control my laugh reading<br />this funny!</p>
<p>So post independence Indian politics/governance infact<br />worsened itself made British better like the above<br />incident.</p>
<p>There were 180 ponds/lakes until 1947 in Chennai<br />effectively helping water supply/drainage. All become<br />residential areas and nowadays in Chennai, rain <br />making 1000 lakes. What a reverse comedy!!</p>
<p>I am not justifying British atrocities but the "We<br />OUR" done/doing more atrocities.</p>

<p>  ----- Original Message ----<br />  From: Sivapathasekaran <sps10142004@yahoo.co.in <br />  To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />  Sent: Friday, November 23, 2007 9:22:12 AM<br />  Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: interesting question</sps10142004@yahoo.co.in></p>
<p>  We should definitely record our appreciation and<br />  gratitude to the <br />  British for having shown keenness in knowing Indian<br />  History, <br />  particularly the South Indian History - through<br />  epigrahy - thanks to <br />  the efforts of their renowned Archeologists - like<br />  Heultz and others.</p>
<p>  They have furnished unbiased History from what they<br />  have decyphered.</p>
<p>  Venkayya and other epigraphists assisted them in<br />  great way. But they <br />  had details of various inscriptions. Not much<br />  co-related.</p>
<p>  KA Neelakanta Sastry, who was Professor in Madras /<br />  Mysore <br />  Universities, assembled almost every piece of<br />  inscription and given <br />  shape to HISTORY of Southern India!</p>
<p>  His " The Colas" is a manumental work.</p>
<p>  Subsequently Sadasiva Pandarathar of Annamalai<br />  University came out <br />  with his book Chozhar varalaaru .. followed by Dr.<br />  Maa. <br />  Raasamaanickanar.</p>
<p>  This is the Greatness of KAN.</p>
<p>  Among several thousand such inscriptions, Kalki<br />  chose one inscription <br />  from Udayarkudi @ Kaatumannargudi (which is located<br />  on the banks of <br />  Veeranam lake - just one KM north of Veeranarayana<br />  perumal temple) - <br />  which was published by KAN Sastry in Epigraphia<br />  Indica and wrote the <br />  magnum opus PONNIYINSELVAN.</p>
<p>  This inscription is still there on the Northern wall<br />  of the sanctum of <br />  Anantheeswarar temple - wherein the 4 characters<br />  namely Ravidasan - <br />  Parameswaran and his two other brothers figure along<br />  with Aditha <br />  karikalan !</p>
<p>  We have extensively discussed this : check<br />  Udayarkudi inscriptions / <br />  Aditha karikalan murder etc., etc., in the<br />  Archieves.</p>
<p>  Iamgine KALKI wrote 5 volumes on one inscription -<br />  published and <br />  narrated by KAN !</p>
<p>  That is the Greatness of Kalki. </p>
<p>  Both are complimentary to each other ..</p>

<p>Vajrahasta One Who Has A Thunderbolt In His Hands </p>
<p>- the vajra find repeated mention in various cultures</p>
<p>- Zeus resorted to his famous keraun?s to defeat Typhon and the <br />Biblical Yahweh subjected Leviathan or Yamm with a similar device</p>
<p>- indra weilds it ( interesting account of how it was made - will <br />post it later)<br />- the japanese call is Kong<br />- buddha holds the Rdo-rje<br />- scandanavia - Thor's Hammer </p>
<p>The form of the vajra as a sceptre or a weapon appears to have its <br />origin in the single or double trident, which arose as a symbol of <br />the thunderbolt or lightning in many ancient civilizations of the <br />Near and Middle East. Parallels are postulated with the meteoric <br />hammer of the Teutonic sky-god Thor, the thunderbolt and sceptre of <br />the Greek sky-god Zeus, and the three thunderbolts of the Roman god <br />Jupiter. As a hurled weapon the indestructible thunderbolt blazed <br />like a meteoric fireball across the heavens, in a maelstrom of <br />thunder, fire and lightning."</p>
<p>what strikes me is the design of the vajra and its usage - the <br />commondality spans the entire earth/ with its uniformity in design. <br />ofcourse it is a thunderbolt making machine but it does have anusual <br />shape for a lightning thrower, some people describe this design as a <br />manifestation of the visible world axis during one of its most <br />complex phases. The little sphere in the centre represented the seed <br />from which the universe was thought to have arisen and the <br />two `lotus blossoms' at the opposite ends symbolised the poles of <br />the universe connected by the central axis mundi.</p>
<p>Lightning is one of the primary manifestations of plasma in the <br />ionosphere and the atmosphere of the earth. It is intriguing, <br />therefore, that the complex morphology displayed in the vajr? and <br />other ancient forms of the thunderbolt is matched by laboratory <br />experiments involving a high-energy z-pinch plasma discharge. This <br />striking convergence poses the question if ancient societies could <br />have correctly remembered some of the most complex stages of a real <br />display of plasma in the sky.</p>
<p>Vajras may have nine, five or three spokes. The spokes of a peaceful <br />Vajra meet at the tip whereas those of a wrathful vajra are slightly <br />splayed at the end. When paired with a bell their length can vary <br />from four finger-widths to twenty-eight finger widths.</p>
<p>Vajra in design</p>
<p>The upper sets of spokes of a five-spoked vajra symbolize the <br />five wisdoms, which are:</p>
<p>1) The mirror like wisdom-that which reflects all sense perceptions <br />is purified when one attains enlightenment and becomes the mirror <br />like wisdom. <br />2) The wisdom of equality-arises after all the feelings of <br />pleasantness, unpleasantness and indifference have been purified. <br />3) The wisdom of individual analysis-arises when the factor of <br />discrimination, which distinguishes one object from another is <br />purified. It enables one to benefit each sentient being according to <br />his or her needs and disposition. <br />4) The wisdom of accomplishing activity-arises when the basic <br />ability to perform acts according to particular circumstances is <br />purified. <br />5) The wisdom of the sphere of reality-arises when consciousness is <br />purified and becomes the mind that is the seed of the wisdom truth <br />body of a Buddha. The five lower spokes symbolize have five mothers. </p>
<p>Vajra in Hinduism</p>
<p>Indra - the holder of vajra</p>
<p>"More than 250 hymns have been dedicated to Indra in Rigveda. <br />Another fifty plus hymns sing the praises of Indra in combination <br />with other gods like Vayu, Varuna, Agni, Vishnu, Soma and <br />Brihaspati. Vedic sages do not get tired of describing the glorious <br />deeds of Indra. More than one fourth of the Rig-Vedic verses are <br />about Indra. </p>
<p>Rig-Veda 2.12</p>
<p>13. For whom earth and heaven bow, whose strength mountains fear, <br />who drinks and protects Soma, who holds Vajra in his hand, he, O <br />people, is Indra. </p>
<p>Rigveda 1.32</p>
<p>1. Now I describe the glorious deeds of Indra, who holds Vajra. He <br />killed the serpent and made waters flow. He broke the hearts of <br />mountains.</p>
<p>5. Indra severed and killed the great coverer Vritra by mighty <br />devastating Vajra. Like a trunk of a tree cut down by axe, serpent <br />was lying on earth.</p>
<p>15. Indra, who holds Vajra in his hand, is the king of moving and <br />stationary, of peaceful and horned animals. He is the king of men. <br />He is enveloping like the felly of wheel surrounds spokes."</p>
<p>Vajrayana Buddhism</p>
<p>Sanskrit: Vehicle of the Diamond [or Thunderbolt], also called <br />Tantric Buddhism, important development within Buddhism in India and <br />neighbouring countries, notably Tibet. Vajrayana, in the history of <br />Buddhism, marks the transition from Mahayana speculative thought to <br />the enactment of Buddhist ideas in individual life. The term vajra <br />(Sanskrit: "diamond," or "thunderbolt") is used to signify the <br />absolutely real and indestructible in man, as opposed to the <br />fictions an individual entertains about himself and his nature; yana <br />is the spiritual pursuit of the ultimately valuable and <br />indestructible.</p>

        <p>Hi SPS</p>
<p>Chinese martial arts was to have come from India... according to one belief. We look at them with awe where we are losing the ancient art to modern forms of Karate etc..<br />During time of Budha the map was totally different of what is china or what is india. <br />Kailasam was in India then I believe...</p>

        <p>China was united under Qin, the dude who started the Great wall which was completed by Ming dynasty.<br />They were not speaking different languages (dialects were different) but for most part they were big time clan based (even now).<br />The reason why I thought they were a closer possiblity were<br />a. Beliefs ( ancestor - pithru based prayers - hence the clan possesive model).<br />b. Area - larger than India and the larger the territory - the more difficult to rule.<br />c. Good literacy foundations and evolved humanity. <br />d. Many cultural similarities.</p>
<p>PS: Bogar &amp; his Guru (chinese) and disciples- had migrated back and forth with China - not my theory, but documented - in palani temple walls too.<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogar" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogar">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogar</a><br />- which also makes me wonder how come these dudes in BC could speak chinese where as my neighbors here are chinese and I cannot understand their english to start with :-) .... </p>

        <p>MYSORE MAHARAJA PALACE used to amaze me.. A British Architect has <br />designed this Palace .. budgetted at Rs. 15.00 Lakhs.. Tastefully <br />designed with Lavishness that does not irritate.</p>
<p>See the collections they had about 100 years back..</p>
<p>Royalty in Blood appears to be something very different ....... !</p>
<p>Saw Helen of Troy recently ..</p>
<p>The War sequence was excellent ..</p>
<p>During Seize, they rolled down oil-dipped chute-balls from high points <br />and set fire which caused death several in the lower plains !</p>
<p>Viyugams were well planned..</p>
<p>Reminded me of several Wars we read of our Emperors ..</p>
<p>With linguistic barriers in alien territories 1000 years back our <br />Emperors could fight and Win Battles and hold the Territories for <br />about a Century atleast ! </p>
<p>Congress which Party fought for the Freedom of our Nation could not <br />hold on even for 30 years in one go !</p>
<p>With little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of exposure to World History - I found that Chinese <br />History was something remarkable and the Whites could hardly keep them <br />suppressed for long time!</acronym></p>
<p>European History was something similar to ours - like our several <br />smaller Rajs with heavy infighting - succumbed to mightier Nations - <br />Hunger caused by the extravaganze of Rulers turned Revolution - Pre &amp; <br />Post Nepoleon Era etc., etc.</p>
<p>American History is interesting to study, particularly the Land <br />Developments by Migrants .. away from the Coast - in lands / plains - <br />then mountains / coasts .. North South devide .. etc. in a span of <br />less than 300 years .....</p>
<p>Japanese History was similar to Chinese - traditional yet more open to <br />adaption..</p>
<p>Chinese History appears to be mystry shrouded .. !</p>

<p>am sure you have watched the last emperor - anyway read this account</p>
<p><a href="http://www.royalty.nu/Asia/China/PuYi.html" title="http://www.royalty.nu/Asia/China/PuYi.html">http://www.royalty.nu/Asia/China/PuYi.html</a></p>
<p>The last emperor of China was Henry P'u Yi, pronounced "Poo yee." His <br />name is also sometimes spelled P'u-i, Puyi, Pu-Yi, or Buyi.</p>
<p>P'u Yi was a member of the Ch'ing (or Qing) Dynasty -- a Manchu. The <br />Manchu were originally nomads from Manchuria, northeast of China. They <br />conquered China in 1644, but kept themselves largely separated from <br />the Chinese. They retained their own language and fashions, lived <br />apart, and married other Manchus. For a long time Chinese people <br />weren't even permitted to settle in the Manchu homeland.</p>
<p>By the time P'u Yi was born on February 7, 1906, the Ch'ing Dynasty <br />was in trouble. China had come to be dominated by foreign powers, <br />mainly Westerners. The country was ruled by Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi <br />(or Cixi), who had imprisoned the nominal emperor, Kuang Hsu, for <br />conspiring against her. On her deathbed the empress named young P'u <br />Yi -- the son of the imprisoned emperor's brother -- to succeed her. <br />To make sure the current emperor didn't interfere in her plans, it is <br />said, she had him poisoned. P'u Yi was nearly three years old when the <br />dowager empress died. As emperor he was given the reign name Hsuan <br />Tung.</p></sps10142004@...></p>

<p>The Forbidden City was run by eunuchs, and P'u Yi didn't meet another <br />child until he was seven, when his brother and sister visited him. The <br />children played hide and seek and had a good time until P'u Yi noticed <br />the color of the lining of his brother's sleeve. It was yellow! <br />Outraged, P'u Yi screamed at his brother, who stood at attention and <br />said, "It isn't yellow, sire. It is apricot, Your Imperial Majesty."</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He became emperor at age three and didn't see his mother again until <br />he was 10</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>When he wanted to eat he commanded, "Bring the food!" and immediately <br />the eunuchs brought him six tables full of food: two tables of main <br />dishes, one table of vegetables, and three tables of rice and cakes. <br />He was "limited" to 25 dishes per meal; previous emperors had been <br />served at least 100 dishes. The Forbidden City's cooks prepared food <br />constantly, day and night, so that it would be ready at P'u Yi's whim.</p>

<p>  Spoken Chinese is distinguished by its high level of internal <br />  diversity, though all spoken varieties of Chinese are tonal and <br />  analytic. There are between six and twelve main regional groups of <br />  Chinese (depending on classification scheme), of which the most <br />  populous (by far) is Mandarin (c. 850 million), followed by Wu (c. <br />  90 million), Min (c. 70 million) and Cantonese (c. 70 million). <br />Most <br />  of these groups are mutually unintelligible, though some, like <br />Xiang <br />  and the Southwest Mandarin dialects, may share common terms and <br />some <br />  degree of intelligibility. Chinese is classified as a <br />macrolanguage <br />  with 13 sub-languages in ISO 639-3, though the identification of <br />the <br />  varieties of Chinese as multiple "languages" or as "dialects" of a <br />  single language is a contentious issue.</p>
<p>  The standardized form of spoken Chinese is Standard Mandarin <br />  (Putonghua/Guoyu), based on the Beijing dialect. Standard Mandarin <br />  is the official language of the People's Republic of China, the <br />  Republic of China in Taiwan, as well as one of four official <br />  languages of Singapore. Chinese?de facto, Standard Mandarin?is one <br />  of the six official languages of the United Nations. Of the other <br />  varieties, Standard Cantonese is common and influential in <br />Cantonese-<br />  speaking overseas communities, and remains one of the official <br />  languages of Hong Kong (together with English) and of Macau <br />  (together with Portuguese). Min Nan, part of the Min language <br />group, <br />  is widely spoken in southern Fujian, in Taiwan (where it is known <br />as <br />  Taiwanese or Hoklo) and in Southeast Asia (where it dominates in <br />  Singapore and Malaysia and is known as Hokkien).</p>

<p>  SRIDHAR RATHINAM WROTE ::</p>
<p>  Dear All</p>
<p>  I am not swayed one way or the other</p>
<p>  I am a proud of my country and its ancient heritage at the same time<br />  I am not blind to the facts<br />  ==================================<br />  Fact: 1:: look around the world of places colonised by the powers<br />  and whats left behind?<br />  ==================================<br />  Persions, Afghans and Mughals ...you dont see much of the ancient<br />  hindu heritage in north India...</p>
<p>  Spanish...The natives were completely wiped out of north and southa<br />  merica French ....left the far east in such a state after looting<br />  them they are still in the dogs Like wise the French colonies of<br />  Africa Germany ....I think we all know our history....Well some<br />  believe hitler did it for the better ment of Aryan race...even in<br />  india America....</p>
<p>  I dont deny the fact that the British benefited from Indian wealth<br />  initially it was the EIC then it was a bit moderated with the<br />  Crown....RRC did that 1000 years ago</p>
<p>  They did not have to reform certain civil inequalities...well Sati,<br />  Child marraige and women's right werent social evil in some opinions<br />  Ill reserve my opinion on that...They shouldnt have cared to change<br />  those they were hear only for the money....</p>
<p>  OOPs they did that to show how Hindu were barbarians and to convert<br />  to Christianity ....Yes like the spaniards converted the whole of goa<br />  into catholics...</p>
<p>  Aparthied and the KKK are good examples and thats because they dont<br />  considered coloured as humans at all...If we are proud to consider a<br />  fellow indian as not human so we go and clean ourselves...We have to<br />  be proud of ourselves...cant argue with that...</p>
<p>  I dont deny that exists even today...but still people speak out and<br />  are outraged I am sure we all know of stephen lawrence case which is<br />  still supported by locals...</p>
<p>  Come on I and vijay can choose the British PM just because i lived<br />  in a counytry once ruled by the crown Yes a valid resident of<br />  commonwealth has voting rights in England</p>
<p>  We may all be talking Persian,Tamil, Sanskrit or whatever...Even<br />  today I get asked ''Aap Bharat mein hain Hindi kya bolnahi<br />  sakthi??'' Oh by the way matey My language is older than yours and<br />  yours is only spoken purely by four states maybe more with the<br />  dissections...</p>
<p>  We talked about our Half naked savior he was Ivy league type till he<br />  was brought to harsh reality in the middle of the night in a train in<br />  south africa....He chose to change many dont....<br />  =============<br />  Do you know the support he had from the average white man in England<br />  because he was changing humanity and people recognised it<br />  =============<br />  You can call Tata a saviour but he was a business man</p>
<p>  You can blame the British for the Caste system, the hindu moslem<br />  issues but then if you werent fighting where was the place for the<br />  third man...If ChandaSahib and Mohamed ali didnot go to the French<br />  and English history might be different</p>
<p>  I would recomend you all to read a chapter in Freedom at Midnight<br />  not on Mahatmas exploits but our native maharajas ....Two of them had<br />  a bet on how many girls they could deflower in a month (the custom is<br />  virgins wear a mookuthi and removed it if they were no longer so...)<br />  one of them was able to make a crown out of it....<br />  =================<br />  Well that takes you back to 15th 16th century britain when the<br />  nobels had the right of PrimaNocte...spending the first night with<br />  all their subjects was their right.<br />  =================<br />  Gandhi was astute he ammassed people but it was our own Indians who<br />  were against our own blood as officers and sepoys who beat all those<br />  ahimsa wadis...thats where we went wrong!!!<br />  ==================<br />  Gandhi fought for the british during the war...He gained what he<br />  needed after the war...If britain wanted to do what US is doing in<br />  Afghanistan and Iraq we would not have had any choice...because they<br />  were victorious but they kept their word.</p>
<p>  The notion of Pakistan a hindu state was by a muslim student in<br />  Cambridge which even Jinnah felt was not possible...It happened</p>
<p>  The first Indo pak war was won or atleast not lost thanks to two old<br />  fellow officers talking to each other to save a great war in a<br />  country already tiorn by a partition...It was the Pakistani Chief of<br />  Staff who phoned his indian counterpart both british ofcourse.</p>
<p>  The list is endless.....</p>
<p>  The bottomline We were a great nation with Heritage university<br />  Script and knowledge when the west except Rome and Greece were in<br />  caves...</p>
<p>  We let it slip in the middle thanks to false interpretation of our<br />  own values it was enhanced by foreign intervention but we were to<br />  blam not them</p>
<p>  If we accept that with humility we will progress...</p>
<p>  Thanks</p>

<p>    Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>    I have given enough proofs for my points, and please refer to them.</p>
<p>    "We should see history as it is, and NOT As we are"</p>
<p>    If we judge history by our own morals, then it would not be<br />  history. but<br />    bunch of facts to be hated by us.</p>
<p>    I feel, you havent countered my arguments, in particular.. rather<br />  you<br />    have been replyin in general, that we should accept our wrongs, and<br />    should not hide it under the guise of patriotism..</p>
<p>    I agree.. and we are not hiding any thing.. But, your generic (&amp;     generous) branding of our history as barbarious without british,<br />  is not<br />    only offensive, but of highly ill taste.</p>
<p>    I would like to know the morals in which you brand a thing as right<br />  &amp;     wrong. Or, on what basis did you term those things as problematic<br />  or<br />    barbaric.</p>
<p>    So, the basic question itself is not answered..</p>
<p>    By the way, in your own arguments, that we have to accept our<br />  wrongs of<br />    ours.. Agreed.. But shouldn't we accept the atrocities, and<br />  barbaric<br />    activities of the britishers too?</p>
<p>    What i understood from your point is "Britishers did lot of wrong..<br />  but<br />    let's praise them for their goodness.. whereas, we too had lot of<br />    wrongs, and let us criticise us" ..</p>
<p>    I dont know how far, this argument is valid and just..</p>
<p>    You are so easily terming sati (which is almost voluntary ) as<br />  barbaric,<br />    and yet, look down upon the Jallianwala bagh killing as a mere<br />  historic<br />    incident.</p>
<p>    You are ought to treat untouchability as barbaric/evil, and yet,<br />  the Goa<br />    Inquisition, where the most brutalities and barbaric atrocities<br />  (like<br />    inserting knife in to the YOni of Hindu women, raping them in front<br />  of<br />    their husband) by the dutch christians doesnt appear big enough to<br />  you..</p>
<p>    You ought to treat devdaasi system as barbaric, but failed to agree<br />  the<br />    fact, that Red-light prostitution were introduced by the britishers<br />  in<br />    Mumbai and calcutta... (You might feel, the red-light prostitution<br />  of<br />    mumbai would be better than devdaasi system)..</p>
<p>    And for your info, in christian culture, the a virgin women should<br />    accept jesus as her husband, before entering in to the state of<br />  nun..<br />    (this is exactly the same as devdaasi system, where our women<br />  accepted<br />    god as their husband and inturn developed various arts and dances)..<br />    And this accepting of jesus as husband goes on till today in<br />  Europe..<br />    Would you term them as Barbaric? (you may say it happens in<br />  europe..<br />    but certainly they donot illtreat themselves out of it.. and also<br />  the<br />    fact, that the nuns are produced &amp; misused in india too)</p>
<p>    So, where lies the problem? THe problem of selective reading of<br />    history, and the problem of choosing positives for the british and<br />    negatives for our country?</p>
<p>    I have given you enough links in my previous mail.. Please go<br />  through<br />    those links for once, and then counter them with facts, rather than<br />    vague opinionist argument.</p>
<p>    We are ready to accept our faults.. But, not in terms set by you..<br />  but<br />    in a term, based on true understanding of india. (we are really<br />    becoming lame dumb at this very argument, that we should accept our<br />    mistakes.. a clever argument propogated by the western media<br />  controlled<br />    still by the colonial rulers)</p>

<p>      -Hi<br />      everybody is entitled to his opinion and there is no point getting<br />      personal or emotional about it.</p>
<p>      that was a long reply and befor vk replies i'll just like to add<br />      santayana's statement on history</p>
<p>      'those who ignore the lessons of histroy are forced to repeat it"</p>
<p>      just brushing under the carpet all our minus points wont make us a<br />      confident indian.<br />      its just hogwash.<br />      the first step towards solving a problem is recognising there is a<br />      problem.</p>
<p>      we had all these problems, slavery, women diempowerment, devadasi<br />      system,. all of them were great social problems. justifying them<br />  or<br />      placing the blame on muslim invaders wont do any good.</p>
<p>      in your account anybody who talks about nandigram or polic<br />  excesses<br />      in kashmir is unpatriotic.<br />      its a very wrong approach to hide behind a shield of so called<br />      patriotism when mistakes are pointed out.<br />      i guess a true patriot is one who realises there are follies in<br />  his<br />      society and points out to them bravely.</p>
<p>      its not really a continuation of slave mentality as you point<br />  out.</p>

<p>We talked about our Half naked savior he was Ivy league type till he <br />was brought to harsh reality in the middle of the night in a train in <br />south africa....He chose to change many dont....<br />=============<br />Do you know the support he had from the average white man in England <br />because he was changing humanity and people recognised it <br />=============<br />You can call Tata a saviour but he was a business man</p>
<p>You can blame the British for the Caste system, the hindu moslem <br />issues but then if you werent fighting where was the place for the <br />third man...If ChandaSahib and Mohamed ali didnot go to the French <br />and English history might be different</p>
<p>I would recomend you all to read a chapter in Freedom at Midnight <br />not on Mahatmas exploits but our native maharajas ....Two of them had <br />a bet on how many girls they could deflower in a month (the custom is <br />virgins wear a mookuthi and removed it if they were no longer so...)<br />one of them was able to make a crown out of it....<br />================= <br />Well that takes you back to 15th 16th century britain when the <br />nobels had the right of PrimaNocte...spending the first night with <br />all their subjects was their right.<br />=================<br />Gandhi was astute he ammassed people but it was our own Indians who <br />were against our own blood as officers and sepoys who beat all those <br />ahimsa wadis...thats where we went wrong!!!<br />================== <br />Gandhi fought for the british during the war...He gained what he <br />needed after the war...If britain wanted to do what US is doing in <br />Afghanistan and Iraq we would not have had any choice...because they <br />were victorious but they kept their word.</p>
<p>The notion of Pakistan a hindu state was by a muslim student in <br />Cambridge which even Jinnah felt was not possible...It happened</p>
<p>The first Indo pak war was won or atleast not lost thanks to two old <br />fellow officers talking to each other to save a great war in a <br />country already tiorn by a partition...It was the Pakistani Chief of <br />Staff who phoned his indian counterpart both british ofcourse.</p>
<p>The list is endless.....</p>
<p>The bottomline We were a great nation with Heritage university <br />Script and knowledge when the west except Rome and Greece were in <br />caves...</p>
<p>We let it slip in the middle thanks to false interpretation of our <br />own values it was enhanced by foreign intervention but we were to <br />blam not them</p>
<p>If we accept that with humility we will progress...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>  I have given enough proofs for my points, and please refer to them.</p>
<p>  "We should see history as it is, and NOT As we are"</p>
<p>  If we judge history by our own morals, then it would not be <br />history. but<br />  bunch of facts to be hated by us.</p>
<p>  I feel, you havent countered my arguments, in particular.. rather <br />you<br />  have been replyin in general, that we should accept our wrongs, and<br />  should not hide it under the guise of patriotism..</p>
<p>  I agree.. and we are not hiding any thing.. But, your generic (&amp;   generous) branding of our history as barbarious without british,  <br />is not<br />  only offensive, but of highly ill taste.</p>
<p>  I would like to know the morals in which you brand a thing as right <br />&amp;   wrong. Or, on what basis did you term those things as problematic </p></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote><p>  barbaric.</p>
<p>  So, the basic question itself is not answered..</p>
<p>  By the way, in your own arguments, that we have to accept our <br />wrongs of<br />  ours.. Agreed.. But shouldn't we accept the atrocities, and <br />barbaric<br />  activities of the britishers too?</p>
<p>  What i understood from your point is "Britishers did lot of wrong.. <br />but<br />  let's praise them for their goodness.. whereas, we too had lot of<br />  wrongs, and let us criticise us" ..</p>
<p>  I dont know how far, this argument is valid and just..</p>
<p>  You are so easily terming sati (which is almost voluntary ) as <br />barbaric,<br />  and yet, look down upon the Jallianwala bagh killing as a mere <br />historic<br />  incident.</p>
<p>  You are ought to treat untouchability as barbaric/evil, and yet, <br />the Goa<br />  Inquisition, where the most brutalities and barbaric atrocities <br />(like<br />  inserting knife in to the YOni of Hindu women, raping them in front <br />of<br />  their husband) by the dutch christians doesnt appear big enough to <br />you..</p>
<p>  You ought to treat devdaasi system as barbaric, but failed to agree <br />the<br />  fact, that Red-light prostitution were introduced by the britishers <br />in<br />  Mumbai and calcutta... (You might feel, the red-light prostitution <br />of<br />  mumbai would be better than devdaasi system)..</p>
<p>  And for your info, in christian culture, the a virgin women should<br />  accept jesus as her husband, before entering in to the state of <br />nun.. <br />  (this is exactly the same as devdaasi system, where our women <br />accepted<br />  god as their husband and inturn developed various arts and dances)..<br />  And this accepting of jesus as husband goes on till today in <br />Europe.. <br />  Would you term them as Barbaric? (you may say it happens in <br />europe..<br />  but certainly they donot illtreat themselves out of it.. and also <br />the<br />  fact, that the nuns are produced &amp; misused in india too)</p>
<p>  So, where lies the problem? THe problem of selective reading of<br />  history, and the problem of choosing positives for the british and<br />  negatives for our country?</p>
<p>  I have given you enough links in my previous mail.. Please go <br />through<br />  those links for once, and then counter them with facts, rather than<br />  vague opinionist argument.</p>
<p>  We are ready to accept our faults.. But, not in terms set by you.. <br />but<br />  in a term, based on true understanding of india. (we are really<br />  becoming lame dumb at this very argument, that we should accept our<br />  mistakes.. a clever argument propogated by the western media <br />controlled<br />  still by the colonial rulers)</p>

<p>    we had all these problems, slavery, women diempowerment, devadasi<br />    system,. all of them were great social problems. justifying them <br />or<br />    placing the blame on muslim invaders wont do any good.</p>
<p>    in your account anybody who talks about nandigram or polic <br />excesses<br />    in kashmir is unpatriotic.<br />    its a very wrong approach to hide behind a shield of so called<br />    patriotism when mistakes are pointed out.<br />    i guess a true patriot is one who realises there are follies in <br />his<br />    society and points out to them bravely.</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Venkat,</p>
<p>I accept your view, that the entity of india was british creation.. we<br />are lands of small kingdoms, which existed under large kingdoms.</p>
<p>But, i would like to emphasize that we are culturally united, and the<br />common masses in our ancient india existed as separate entity than the<br />political entity. Political fights are regarded as normal between the<br />kshatriyas, and whoever wins over, taken over the control, and the<br />people accepted their rule, as long as they followed dharma.</p>
<p>The britishers, united the whole of india, because, not for the purpose<br />of uniting us, but for their consolidation for the administrative<br />purposes.</p>
<p>I would like to highlight one of Gandhiji's reply to such question.</p>
<p>The britishers colonised Africa, middle east, and southeast asia.. But<br />they could not establish a single state for the whole of africa or the<br />middle east? Instead they created government of rwanda, congo,<br />southafrice etc etc.. on the other hand, they established Government of<br />India, rather than government of bengal, or government of madras..</p>
<p>Could you please explain why?</p>
<p>Its because, the people of the whole india rallied behind the half-naked<br />man.. and how is that possible? Because, the people of india regarding<br />rishis and saints in high respect, and they saw gandhi as a saint and<br />hence rallied behind this.</p>
<p>now this culture of people is the uniting force, that made britishers to<br />see the unity among whole of india.. and the reason for this culture is<br />that people were largely existed as separate entity than the political<br />entity.</p>
<p>Ok.. coming to your point, should we thank them for creating a single<br />india? (ofcourse, its not them who integrated india, but our great<br />sardar vallabhai patel.. if it had been nehru, then it would be total<br />chaos)..</p>
<p>Infact, they are the ones, who separated the nation in to two with the<br />aim of checkmating such a great nation rising as super power in future..<br />The partition was opposed by majority of people in pakistan itself, but<br />because it suited britishers, they divided it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the kashmir was their own creation, and it was exposed in the<br />recent news article, that mountbatted used his wife to influence nehru<br />to accept kashmir's reference to UN..</p>
<p>Thirdly, till 1990's the british conspired with americans and made all<br />attempts against india to contain it..</p>
<p>Inspite of all these recent historic facts, do you want to get excited<br />at their so called goodness to us?</p>
<p>After all, the very reason they left india was, that there was nothing<br />left over to exploit us.</p>

<p>  today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we<br />  should hate them.<br />  the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi<br />  driver in ajman UAE.</p>
<p>  borders change, and so does history with it.<br />  european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic<br />  tracts as single entities .<br />  indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />  while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir,<br />  or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting<br />  incompatible people.<br />  in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese<br />  and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the case<br />  against them.</p>

<p>    Dear Venkatesh</p>
<p>    Your view is of a burned down India, negative critic at the best.<br />  You can keep on complaining woefully that India would have been a<br />  bunch of tribals or a ill equiped lot of villages. Well, ask the<br />  remaining of community to see who can beat spielberg in recreating<br />  history.</p>
<p>    Paying taxes or attending to schools were a force of rule. Looks<br />  like people such as your self would always prefer to be a slave to<br />  white skin and sing their lullaby anytime.</p>
<p>    Give me a single reason:<br />    Why would the so called tribal indians, who are barbaric and had<br />  been binded to so many social evils and did not speak 'one' language<br />  'unite' against a massive british 'Godly' rule and take them down in<br />  the path that has NEVER ever before been done in the history of the<br />  world. What made these dumb guys so patriotic that they could not<br />  tolerate the british but could tolerate every other ruler even as<br />  horrible as aurangazeb ?</p>
<p>    Oh I forgot, we were split into so many zamindars and duh how the<br />  heck did they all unite under a half naked man ?</p>
<p>    Every country has its dark age, every economy has its fall, every<br />  kingdom has to crash, every corporate has to buckle sometime, law of<br />  nature.<br />    5th century to 1000 AD was british dark age, India started from<br />  1100 to 1700 - not as a dark age but as unstable period. 1300 - 1600<br />  was mugal peak time, there were a lot of disturbances (many people<br />  opposing the mugal autocratic rule) during that time when the country<br />  was 'rediscovering' itself, which people like you conveniently call<br />  as ignorance. India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals ruled<br />  for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250.<br />  Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many<br />  states, so what ? US is 50+ states, china was so many states the<br />  biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of<br />  the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma. Sanskrit was<br />  spoken widely before the british split us, tamil was in tamil<br />  heartland, we used to speak many languages in indian country.</p>
<p>    Ghori / Ghazni plundered the country, we bounced back, mughals<br />  tried to break the hindu culture and failed miserably, Nadir shah<br />  ripped us we rebound back.... then came the british, fresh out of<br />  their dark age, exploring new territories looking for places were<br />  they can spread their culture, education (as if no one else was<br />  educated), systematically ripped us of our minds and caused people<br />  such as yourself who believe in their dominion after 60 years. Whilst<br />  you speak of us going the African way, why wont you think of us going<br />  the Chinese way ? There lies a mind set, again british preset.</p>
<p>    India, an internal economy, there in was her strength, the british<br />  wanted to develop their country and started levying heavy taxes on<br />  Indian goods and exported european goods. Coincided with the<br />  industrial revolution in england...fact or fiction ? Read the<br />  Imperial Gazzetter of 1881:<br />    some experts<br />    1903-04 Data is Lakh Rupees (Rupees of that Era)<br />    Items Imports Exports (Textile)<br />    Apparels 172 16<br />    Raw Cotton 5 2438<br />    Cotton Goods 31288 10<br />    Wool Items 215 27<br />    My country paid (imported) Rs 31,680 lakhs and sold (exported)<br />  Rs.2500 lakh... rocket science on the numbers. This is only in<br />  textile, go for many many other imports and exports you will see that<br />  a billion of dollar value would be transfered every damn year for 100<br />  years of british rule, and here we have patrons to be so happy with<br />  their rule.</p>
<p>    Gandhi systematically counteracted them by dismantling their<br />  managerial capacities, hitting them where it mattered the most, Tata<br />  built its steel plant and rose against the empire, luckily for Tata,<br />  they happened to find customers in british during WW II. Gandhi and<br />  Tata worked closely in removing the steel trade of british from<br />  India. Check the public documents of Birmingham and Sheffield.<br />    Next - salt, monopoly of salt trade, british hit us with that and<br />  that was when our power as a nation moved full surge ahead.<br />    You can be proud that we helped england rebuild itself with our<br />  money.<br />    And coming to think of the tribal chieftains, they are still<br />  available today... they just kept changing names.. from sitrarasan of<br />  chola period to chieftains of mugal rules to zamindars of british<br />  rule to MLA's of republic of India. We are still at war with our<br />  neighbors, for water for trade for space for land etc... We will<br />  always be at war, it is our family, we will come to a compromise<br />  today or tomorrow. your motive says that just because karnataka wont<br />  release water, get whites to rule us.... how cool!</p>
<p>    This is a great country, no matter how many people work hard on<br />  demotivating us or plundering us, we will prove our mettle. One thing<br />  is for sure, it is immaterial if Maculay really said his famous quote<br />  in 1835, what is alleged definitely is happening today. They have<br />  successfully planted their domain in minds of many indians. It is<br />  another test for the great nation and I am sure she will come good as<br />  usual.</p>

<p>    Hi Venu<br />    I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />    thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid their<br />    taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.</p>
<p>    most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs who<br />    saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh<br />  war.<br />    the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />    what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful<br />    nation called india in say 1600.<br />    if you were born in 1600 ( or as you say 1970 if the british had<br />  not<br />    come at all) you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of<br />    pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of<br />  ramnad<br />    or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of<br />    madurai.<br />    that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />    you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great<br />  show<br />    of unity united on their own in the national interest and then<br />  opened<br />    negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of<br />    hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of tranvancore,<br />    the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin.<br />    this would have united south india.<br />    then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern<br />  hindu<br />    muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings( ar you will be<br />    calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon) to<br />    unite one democratic nation called india.<br />    you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />    even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the<br />  sardar<br />    to join the indian confedration.<br />    the maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and<br />    you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and pelf<br />  so<br />    that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />    its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.</p>
<p>    have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited<br />    in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been<br />    discussing.</p>
<p>    to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but<br />    trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>    patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should<br />  not<br />    be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>    what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or<br />  the<br />    slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un<br />  united<br />    india.<br />    regards<br />    venketesh</p>
<p>      Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric<br />    tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a<br />    shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters....<br />  pathetic<br />    and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how<br />    people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence<br />  India<br />    is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is<br />    childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<p>      Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability,<br />    child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly<br />    set afire by the British.</p>
<p>      Sati:<br />      1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core<br />  of<br />    issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British never<br />    allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have<br />    added more points below.)<br />      2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at<br />    that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage.<br />  honestly<br />    how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life<br />    is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of<br />    treatment she gets even today.<br />      We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where<br />    there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people,<br />    there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs<br />    during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />      The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted<br />    by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have<br />    lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the<br />    1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of<br />    compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the<br />    hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do<br />    with western explorers landing in India...)<br />      Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It ties<br />    up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now<br />    where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<p>      Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a<br />    concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the<br />    middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not<br />  open.<br />    Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies<br />    etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old<br />    book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that<br />    untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a<br />    1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new<br />    definition as caste politics now.</p>
<p>      Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan<br />  kaamanai<br />    vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during<br />    the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of<br />    Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when<br />    their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet'<br />  was<br />    to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that<br />    reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think<br />    what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex,<br />  dating<br />    was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for<br />    reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model<br />    and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex<br />  is<br />    taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our<br />  great<br />    grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they<br />  were<br />    children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare<br />    the success of child<br />      mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out<br />  dated<br />    concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) to<br />    follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer<br />    our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where<br />    girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life.<br />    Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on<br />    internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the<br />    energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into<br />    'talent'.</p>
<p>      A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the<br />    African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious<br />  comment<br />    or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not<br />    understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare<br />    India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one<br />  serious<br />    literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations<br />  in<br />    Africa is more or less degrading my country.</p>
<p>      A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did,<br />    by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy<br />    trains vs the TUBE in london).<br />      There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant<br />  management<br />    people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />      people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like<br />    dyre or jackson the<br />      british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />      supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have<br />    even<br />      caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the<br />  british<br />    to rethink a motive. That<br />      is management strategy not to be confused as 'Oh Almighty British<br />  -<br />    I see your Grace in the bread we eat'.</p>
<p>      Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />      patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on<br />  india<br />    was<br />      definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read<br />    Kalki's<br />      comments on Churchill's thoughts on India. Make no mistake,<br />  Britain<br />    is a great country for the British, but to even think that they<br />  were<br />    the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note.</p>
<p>      Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are<br />  worthless<br />    and sing<br />      hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India<br />    does<br />      not exist without the west.</p>
<p>      Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />      equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain<br />  is<br />    Europe's crime<br />      hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation<br />    recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is<br />    like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them<br />  making<br />    mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather<br />  than<br />    adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<p>      A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more<br />  worry.<br />      What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor<br />  citizens<br />      who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.</p>
<p>      I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real<br />    Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>      On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british<br />  able<br />    to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were<br />    Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have<br />  an<br />    idea now.</p>

<p>      Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>      I would definitely be against all your points. What you<br />  described,<br />    may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the<br />    characteristics of india.</p>
<p>      I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing<br />    our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill<br />    of ourself.</p>
<p>      Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>      1) The Sati system<br />      The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history.<br />    Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the<br />  women.<br />      Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain<br />    areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request<br />  you<br />    to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to<br />  a<br />    women committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<p>      <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>      2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>      I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards<br />    this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We<br />    should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the<br />  dress<br />    style is entirely different..</p>
<p>      3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>      This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts.<br />    Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower<br />    caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the<br />    SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<p>      Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those<br />    semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in<br />  india,<br />    the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the<br />    semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>      The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation.</p>
<p>      4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>      Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your<br />    ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools<br />  in<br />    Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of<br />    today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.<br />      The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in<br />    all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>      You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>
<p>      <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /<br />  3beautiful-<br />    tree.zip </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>      5) Fate of widows<br />      You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But<br />    they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the<br />    western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th<br />    century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>      6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>      Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system<br />    were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the<br />    devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />      <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>      The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the<br />    highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as<br />    sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and<br />    devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of<br />    choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life.<br />  the<br />    concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism<br />  effect.)</p>
<p>      See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the<br />  bharatanatyam,<br />    were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like<br />    lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />      Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as<br />    prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam<br />    cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded<br />  to<br />    prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British<br />    rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<p>      7. Slavery:<br />      Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of<br />    time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>      8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>      Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a<br />    usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close<br />    relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the<br />    girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The<br />    girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her<br />    childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<p>      Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those<br />    days.</p>
<p>      "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in<br />  the<br />    west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>      If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why<br />    it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>      9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>      Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication,<br />  and<br />    spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every<br />    profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested<br />  with<br />    brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with<br />    vellalars.</p>
<p>      also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be<br />    priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of<br />    untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>      So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few<br />    castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed<br />    priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>      10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>      This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our<br />    mother tongues..</p>
<p>      11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>      Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the<br />    animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its<br />  sacrificed<br />    in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer..</p>
<p>      Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated<br />    slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />      Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own<br />    community (not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious,<br />    and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>      Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>      Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like<br />  that,<br />    let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>      we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>      I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who<br />    committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa<br />    Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism,<br />    committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<p>      <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br />      <http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>      Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one<br />    is barbaric.</p>
<p>      No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really<br />    a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of<br />  our<br />    culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going<br />    to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a<br />    paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition,<br />    still india is our only land for us)</p>

<p>        The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />        about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />        really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />        those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />        society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />        today, when compared with contemporary nations:</p>
<p>        1) The Sati system<br />        2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />        garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />        3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />        4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />        5) Fate of widows<br />        6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />        devadasi system<br />        7) Slavery<br />        8) Marriage at childhood<br />        9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />        10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />        11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>        But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />        main crux to be focussed.</p>
<p>        The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />        children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />        pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />        truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />        enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />        should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />        illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />        they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Venkat,</p>
<p>You are referring to the select few maharajas, that too under the<br />british rule..</p>
<p>We had numerous other examples.. for example, i have read an article<br />in tamil magazine "vaaramalar", where the travancore maharaja was<br />under immense pressure from the british collector to pay the tax, but<br />that year there was very little tax collected due to famine. He was<br />ready to get arrested, but the next day, the whole people of his<br />dominion, came forward and offered all their golds, and some women<br />even her gold mangala (thaali), and saved their maharaja from getting<br />arrested.</p>
<p>There are numerous such incidents that occurred, but we are not taught<br />about these.. and because we are not taught about those, we are so<br />less, in confidence, that we often denigrate ourselves under the grab<br />of "Accepting the truth"...</p>
<p>Ok.. what i ask is how could india be the richest country, when<br />britishers came, under the same maharajas?</p>
<p>Please see how wealthy, the empire of vijayanagar.. Please read the<br />book "The forgotten empire" in the following link</p>
<p><http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3310 </p>
<p>Again, what you term is another peculiar disease of degrading our own<br />kings, and place them in par with the invaders, as though we are third<br />persons having no relation to them.. this is another theory and<br />argument propogated by the wester imperialistic english media.</p>
<p>Our kings are part of us unlike the invaders who came to loot us.. <br />Our kings protected us, administered us, and under their rule, our<br />people were far far richer than the rest of the world. accusing our<br />kings of luxuries is completely out of context, and a gross<br />mis-representation.</p>
<p>The main reason, why our kings were lost is because we had the raja<br />dharma, followed by almost all our ancient kings. Prithviraj chauhan<br />forgiving ghori is because of our epic example of ramayana.. there is<br />least probability that he might have expected ghori to be so barbaric,..</p>
<p>We had our rajadharma, where the enemy is also treated wisely..</p>
<p>Its our great virtues which led to our demise, rather than our<br />dis-unity. BEcause, the kind of warfare that the muslims and<br />christians fought, were completely alien to us.. We could very well<br />compare the invasion of alexander with the later muslims and christian<br />kingdoms..  </p>
<p>In that context, it was first the king of orissa, who employed equal<br />brutal tactics to drive away the invading muslims and then later<br />followed by the shivaji maharaj..</p>
<p>And the whole of south india rallied behind the vijayanagara rulers,<br />to fight against the muslim invaders.. Arent this, not a sign of unity?</p>
<p>Again, i would like to highligh.. our kings failed mostly because of<br />our virtues inspired from our epics, and partly, the ruthless war<br />tactics followed by the invading forces, which is completely alien to us.</p>

<p>    Your view is of a burned down India, negative critic at the best. <br />  You can keep on complaining woefully that India would have been a <br />  bunch of tribals or a ill equiped lot of villages. Well, ask the <br />  remaining of community to see who can beat spielberg in recreating <br />  history.</p>
<p>  Never<br />  I am an indian who is proud of his heritage, ashamed of the ills of <br />  the country with an unvarnished view of history where I want to give <br />  credit to those who deserve it. <br />  And I certainly dont need lessons in patriotism.</p>
<p>  we have achieved a lot yes but was that possible being a subhject of <br />  maharaja ofpudukottai or the zamindar of banganapalle.</p>
<p>  the maharajah of pudukottai marthanda pairava thondaiman married and <br />  australian and was chucked out by the british who wanted a blue <br />  blooded indian royal to inherit his gaddi.<br />  as a compensation marthana a top horse owner in australia demanded <br />  and got 20 lakh rupees which was one years tazation income in <br />  pudukottai. that year incidentaly 10, 000 of his subjects died due to <br />  starvation and disease in a drought.</p>
<p>  the lives and leisures of the maharajahs would have made india a <br />  bankrupt nation.<br />  its not singing the english lullaby to give cresit to the british for <br />  chucking out these blod thirsty mosquitoes.<br />  venketesh</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>I have given enough proofs for my points, and please refer to them.</p>
<p>"We should see history as it is, and NOT As we are"</p>
<p>If we judge history by our own morals, then it would not be history. but<br />bunch of facts to be hated by us.</p>
<p>I feel, you havent countered my arguments, in particular.. rather you<br />have been replyin in general, that we should accept our wrongs, and<br />should not hide it under the guise of patriotism..</p>
<p>I agree.. and we are not hiding any thing.. But, your generic (&amp; generous) branding of our history as barbarious without british, is not<br />only offensive, but of highly ill taste.</p>
<p>I would like to know the morals in which you brand a thing as right &amp; wrong. Or, on what basis did you term those things as problematic or<br />barbaric.</p>
<p>So, the basic question itself is not answered..</p>
<p>By the way, in your own arguments, that we have to accept our wrongs of<br />ours.. Agreed.. But shouldn't we accept the atrocities, and barbaric<br />activities of the britishers too?</p>
<p>What i understood from your point is "Britishers did lot of wrong.. but<br />let's praise them for their goodness.. whereas, we too had lot of<br />wrongs, and let us criticise us" ..</p>
<p>I dont know how far, this argument is valid and just..</p>
<p>You are so easily terming sati (which is almost voluntary ) as barbaric,<br />and yet, look down upon the Jallianwala bagh killing as a mere historic<br />incident.</p>
<p>You are ought to treat untouchability as barbaric/evil, and yet, the Goa<br />Inquisition, where the most brutalities and barbaric atrocities (like<br />inserting knife in to the YOni of Hindu women, raping them in front of<br />their husband) by the dutch christians doesnt appear big enough to you..</p>
<p>You ought to treat devdaasi system as barbaric, but failed to agree the<br />fact, that Red-light prostitution were introduced by the britishers in<br />Mumbai and calcutta... (You might feel, the red-light prostitution of<br />mumbai would be better than devdaasi system)..</p>
<p>And for your info, in christian culture, the a virgin women should<br />accept jesus as her husband, before entering in to the state of nun.. <br />(this is exactly the same as devdaasi system, where our women accepted<br />god as their husband and inturn developed various arts and dances)..<br />And this accepting of jesus as husband goes on till today in Europe.. <br />Would you term them as Barbaric? (you may say it happens in europe..<br />but certainly they donot illtreat themselves out of it.. and also the<br />fact, that the nuns are produced &amp; misused in india too)</p>
<p>So, where lies the problem? THe problem of selective reading of<br />history, and the problem of choosing positives for the british and<br />negatives for our country?</p>
<p>I have given you enough links in my previous mail.. Please go through<br />those links for once, and then counter them with facts, rather than<br />vague opinionist argument.</p>
<p>We are ready to accept our faults.. But, not in terms set by you.. but<br />in a term, based on true understanding of india. (we are really<br />becoming lame dumb at this very argument, that we should accept our<br />mistakes.. a clever argument propogated by the western media controlled<br />still by the colonial rulers)</p>

<blockquote><p>  -Hi<br />  everybody is entitled to his opinion and there is no point getting<br />  personal or emotional about it.</p>
<p>  that was a long reply and befor vk replies i'll just like to add<br />  santayana's statement on history</p>
<p>  'those who ignore the lessons of histroy are forced to repeat it"</p>
<p>  just brushing under the carpet all our minus points wont make us a<br />  confident indian.<br />  its just hogwash.<br />  the first step towards solving a problem is recognising there is a<br />  problem.</p>
<p>  we had all these problems, slavery, women diempowerment, devadasi<br />  system,. all of them were great social problems. justifying them or<br />  placing the blame on muslim invaders wont do any good.</p>
<p>  in your account anybody who talks about nandigram or polic excesses<br />  in kashmir is unpatriotic.<br />  its a very wrong approach to hide behind a shield of so called<br />  patriotism when mistakes are pointed out.<br />  i guess a true patriot is one who realises there are follies in his<br />  society and points out to them bravely.</p>
<p>  its not really a continuation of slave mentality as you point out.</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi sathish</p>
<p>the basic question where this discussion started whas who united <br />india as it is today?</p>
<p>you said if the british didnt do it then somebody else would have.<br />thats not how we approach a problem.<br />be specific,<br />who else?<br />there must have been 4-5000 countries in this land when the mughals <br />broke up.<br />who could have united them.</p>
<p>a colonialist takes over a country for his own interests . not <br />charity.<br />india took over kashmir and sikkim for its own benefit not for <br />charity.<br />inspite of that as sri said the british cared to reform what they <br />could.<br />the presidency college in chennai stared by the british has produced <br />2 nobel laureates. one before freedom and one after.</p>
<p>thats why i asked you a question<br />whose rule was better?<br />today you live under a chief minister who denies the existence of <br />your very god. i dont think the british ever went to that extent.</p>
<p>you live in a country where the government employs goons to thrash <br />and kill people in 17,000 acres, rape their women, burn their houses <br />because the communist( ha ha) government have sold the land to a <br />foreign company.<br />is this any better than jallinwalla bagh.?</p>

<blockquote><p>  I dont think this argument is going anywhere. But I feel Sri and <br />  Venkat refuses to accept the ill's the british has left back.</p>
<p>  I clearly said - British rule is like giving a pot full of rice to <br />a <br />  hungry person with a drop of poison in it. Simple, loud and clear.</p>
<p>  A small drop in a potfull might not kill the person, but surely <br />will <br />  have some side effects, and ofcourse ill effects. Thats what <br />British <br />  rule has led us to.</p>
<p>  I didnt get any impression from Ravi's mail that he was supporting <br />  Aurangzeb's rule to British rule. I wonder whether I got it wrong <br />of <br />  Venkat got it wrong, and why should I be questioned for this. :)</p>
<p>  Venkat was the one who told me (taught me) that for almost 80 years <br />  of Muslim rule in Madurai there were no Hindu celebrations. Later I <br />  learnt it when I read 'Thiruvarangan Ula'. For nearly 5 century's <br />  Bhrath was plundered by muslim invasion and the foundations of <br />  sanathana dharma was shaken. Then came Sivaji to rebuild the Hindu <br />  good, a concept of Hindu liberty. But what did we get out of <br />British <br />  rule, apart from Indian Railways and the corrupted adminstrative <br />  system. Thats whay I meant by 'a potful of rice with a drop of <br />  poison'. A evil in the disguise of good.</p>
<p>  When Sri and Venkat say that we should look at our ills, I am <br />asking <br />  them, why dont you look at the goods we had? I strongly feel that <br />  taking a balanced look at of our goods and bads and taking the good <br />  and leaving the bad behind is the path to success. Pondering over <br />  the bads alone will take us no where. you are saying the glass i <br />  half empty, people like me and Ravi say the glass is half full. <br />Same <br />  points in different perspective.</p>
<p>  What has happened has happened. We cant change it. But we should <br />  admit that amidst a few good, the British has done a lot of harm to <br />  us. Material development can be achived only if we have a strong <br />  minds. British gave us material development but ruined our thought <br />  process. Thats a hard fact which everyone should accept.</p>
<p>  Saying that without english (meaning without British coming to <br />  India), we could not have become global IT power, is baseless. What <br />  about China? They are equally good. Only problem they have is lack <br />  of English. Now they have realized it and started learning english. <br />  In next 10 years, they will also be good in English. Its a matter <br />of <br />  time. If we were not talking english, we would have in next 10 <br />  years. Matter of time. compulsion of time. No one can go against <br />it. <br />  Just for giving english knowledge, we should not say British did a <br />  lot of good to us. They did equal amount of good and equal amount <br />of <br />  bad. But the bad's have a long lasting impact than the good they <br />  did. Lets accept it.</p>

<p>One man's gain is other man's loss - its survival of the fittest and <br />has been in vougue from time immemorial. its the unwritten code of <br />nature - a marauding male lion on taking over a pride ensures that <br />it kills every cub of his predessesor - so that lionesses can beget <br />his progency quicker and he can ensure his succession. the lioness <br />too carries no ill accepts fate and communes with the killer of its <br />cubs!!! thats the harsh truth of survival.</p>
<p>every conquerer plundered - gold, god - glory. the anals of history <br />dont often bear signs of the vanquished - so you often get to see <br />only one side....was <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  a plunderer - when he got back the pandya <br />diadem along with the lankan crown jewels - the sri lankan anals <br />talk of wholesome destruction of buddhist stupas/ scultures etc. war <br />trophies....right from pallava times kings have brought back war <br />trophies - do you think they were gifts - vatapi was burned - wealth <br />( gold, statutes, men, women)were brought back to be lavished on our <br />temples..... not that we were foreever humble people not interfering <br />in others affairs...how many times have the moovendars interfered in <br />the affairs of lanka....why did <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  capture maldives of all places - <br />to safe gaurd his growing sea trade, similar designs have been <br />attributed to <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym 's kedaram campaign. ....the tide was turned during <br />kafur period. just like a once powerful lion with the passage of <br />time, gets weaker and is displaced by a younger more powerful one - <br />just this time, it was from a distant, different tribe and more <br />ferocious. </acronym></acronym></acronym></p></satisharun@...></p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Venkat,</p>
<p>There is no odd notion here. And you have also been attaching an emotional outcry without attempting to understand or completely read what I had mentioned. And I do not need lessons to patriotism either. Your grasp on my words as usual have been an impatient gesture to contradict what is said. Thats how you got to 'derive' some odd statement that Aurangazeb rule was better.... I am thinking how complex of a theorem you had to build to come into that conclusion through multiple iterations... </p>
<p>Aurangazeb did gross injustice,then Shivaji happened, but that was not a national fight...yet, before it got there...aurangazeb left the planet. Aurangazeb had to struggle for every inch of land he conquered. By the time he touched the Deccan plateau he was drowning. He ruled less than 1/4th of what is today's mainland india. He ruled for 48 years of which the second half was spent in the deccan losing to Shivaji. Aurangazeb is not the context of discussion but british are. Aurangazeb is a whole different story all together.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, I do live in the west and I am not sure what that has to do with thoughts on India. In the US, you are free to criticize anything you want, their iraq war, their foreign policies etc... but I am yet to see any critic on their freedom fighters. Please do not say US does not have issues... </p>
<p>I have been insisting that our democracy - dharma - is the way of life. I had quoted places from the Gita and other practices, in all essence there should be quite a lot for you to splits i guess :-) </p>
<p>Travancore Dewan:<br />And again, why would you mix two entities into one common port , seshaya shastry - one of the sponsors of Ravi Varma and Seshaya shastry the british appointed dewan of travancore...every coin has another side is what I say, I for one, do not want to believe what a british appointed dewan wrote, without researching more into it.</p>
<p>Patriotism is key to bringing forward a country, the sense of my country, my people is key for us to build a stronger country. A soldier needs to look at his dead peer to feel the adrenaline and seek revenge, but he needs patriotism to be at the war front in the first place. A non patriotic soldier is no use for his peers or his country.</p>
<p>Covering up under the rug is the accusation, in a family if there are situations where there is a problem child, we try to rectify it in our home, not seek help from thugs. Post independance india has issues, too many issues, we are breathing free <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym after a long time, it takes time and cycles to settle down. What is the point in analyzing history if we do not learn from it. Ridiculing almost all of our freedom struggle attempts are not for my favor at anytime. </p>
<p>Gandi's movement:<br />Yes there were periods of gaps in Gandhi's movements as pointed out by Muruganandam... however he also points that..Gandhi worked during pauses to collect mass support. I dont think any of us here were witness to the freedom stuggle and to go by logic on 10% support of 30 cr may not be a right number. There may have been atleast more than 20% of people like myself or some others... The world knew of a great man in Gandhi, he taught the world a lot, even if there are people who are critics of Gandhi the man, the mahatma had done a lot for not just India but for the whole world...and was rightly called the mahatma.. You all have read great books written by many authors for your wide knowledge, I would humbly request a read of Gandhi's Gita. Only a person of great and vast knowledge and ...spiritually evolved, can write so.</p>
<p>I would be lying if I say I am not emotional and cold on facts only, agreed. I do not know how many others feel same way, every topic other than national sentiments can be debated upon with a balanced view, this is something that needs a dash of color to it. Every one is entitled to their own views on religion, language or any subject. Forsome reason, I feel the whole issue of freedom is bound to have emotions attached for simple people such as me. Nothing personal against venkat or sridhar but freedom struggle is definitely an emotional one for me. </p>
<p>In the movie, Gandhi.. there is a statement at last when the general points out that without the british there will be so many indias inside india... for which members of our first congress replies that it would not be britain's problem to deal with but ours. I stand by that. I always will.</p>
<p>Again, there is nothing to say, the discussion became pointless, when freedom fighters and their cause is thrown to depths. Respecting and honoring our statesmen is the very least we can do to appreciate what they did. Finally, the catalyst for english lullaby started from the note on 'your freedom fighters', rightly it should have atleast been...i say again, atleast it should have been 'our freedom fighters'. </p>

<p>Hi ravi<br />it would be a great conversation if you dont keep dropping words like <br />supporters of british or singing the british lullaby or slave to the <br />white skin.</p>
<p>the british left india sixty years back and you have such strong <br />feelings on racism. I guess you must be living in the west.<br />jut talking facts has brought this group to this level. over heated <br />emotions have very little place.</p>
<p>as for the nautch girls issue in pudukottai, details were given by <br />sesshaiyaa sastri the great administrator of travancore and <br />pudukottai.( also the first sponsor of ravivarma the painter)<br />seshaiya was the person who reformed the pudukottai state when it was <br />in doldrums.</p>

<p>  Hi Sri<br />  thanks a lot .</p>
<p>  but then i wasnt really insulted by ravi's mention of my zamindari <br />  back ground.<br />  my anscestors did so much for hindu religion and tamil culture and <br />  music that any mention of their political leanings would have no <br />  substance at all.<br />  if your anscestor was a zamindar, or a clerk in the british <br />  government it mattered the same. you had accepted their supremacy.<br />  the same went on for studying in british started schools, paying <br />the <br />  taxes. the fact is greater part of the nation had accepted british <br />  rule gladly because they knew what was happening in the <br />neighbouring <br />  princely state.it was a terrible state of affairs.<br />  even in a small state like pudukottai the british had to <br />occasionally <br />  enter the palace to chase out the hundreds of nautch girls in the <br />  palace and send the king to a sanatorium.<br />  why do we have contreversies that the national anthem jana gana <br />mana <br />  was really sung for the british emperor<br />  why was it that the freedom movement was greatly planned by UK <br />  returned leaders.</p>
<p>  and its news to me that aurangazeb was greatly tolerated by the <br />  people of india by any other emotion other than fear.</p>

<p>    Dear All<br />    I thing we are getting too emotional and personal here I think <br />Ravi <br />  owes an apology to venkat for bring his ancestors into this...<br />    Can we have a discusiion from the Head and not from the Heart <br />  blinded by fictious facts.</p>
<p>    I am not swayed one way or the other</p>
<p>    I am a proud of my country and its ancient heritage at the same <br />  time I am not blind to the facts</p>
<p>    Fact: look around the world of places colonised by the powers and <br />  whats left behind?</p>
<p>    Persions, Afghans and Mughals ...you dont see much of the ancient <br />  hindu heritage in north India...</p>
<p>    Spanish...The natives were completely wiped out of north and <br />southa <br />  merica<br />    French ....left the far east in such a state after looting them <br />  they are still in the dogs Like wise the French colonies of Africa<br />    Germany ....I think we all know our history....Well some believe <br />  hitler did it for the better ment of Aryan race...even in india<br />    America....</p>
<p>    I dont deny the fact that the British benefited from Indian <br />wealth <br />  initially it was the EIC then it was a bit moderated with the <br />  Crown....RRC did that 1000 years ago</p>
<p>    They did not have to reform certain civil inequalities. ..well <br />Sati, <br />  Child marraige and women's right werent social evil in some <br />opinions <br />  Ill reserve my opinion on that...They shouldnt have cared to change <br />  those they were hear only for the money....</p>
<p>    OOPs they did that to show how Hindu were barbarians and to <br />convert <br />  to Christianity ....Yes like the spaniards converted the whole of <br />goa <br />  into catholics...</p>
<p>    Satish <br />    Aparthied and the KKK are good examples and thats because they <br />dont <br />  considered coloured as humans at all...If we are proud to consider <br />a <br />  fellow indian as not human so we go and clean ourselves... We have <br />to <br />  be proud of ourselves... cant argue with that...<br />    I dont deny that exists even today...but still people speak out <br />and <br />  are outraged I am sure we all know of stephen lawrence case which <br />is <br />  still supported by locals...</p>
<p>    Come on I and vijay can choose the British PM just because i <br />lived <br />  in a counytry once ruled by the crown Yes a valid resident of <br />  commonwealth has voting rights in England</p>
<p>    We may all be talking Persian,Tamil, Sanskrit or whatever...Even <br />  today I get asked ''Aap Bharat mein hain Hindi kya bolnahi <br />  sakthi??'' Oh by the way matey My language is older than yours and <br />  yours is only spoken purely by four states maybe more with the <br />  dissections. ..</p>
<p>    We talked about our Half naked savior he was Ivy league type till <br />  he was brought to harsh reality in the middle of the night in a <br />train <br />  in south africa....He chose to change many dont....<br />    Do you know the support he had from the average white man in <br />  England because he was changing humanity and people recognised it <br />    You can call Tata a saviour but he was a business man</p>
<p>    You can blame the British for the Caste system, the hindu moslem <br />  issues but then if you werent fighting where was the place for the <br />  third man...If ChandaSahib and Mohamed ali didnot go to the French <br />  and English history might be different</p>
<p>    I would recomend you all to read a chapter in Freedom at Midnight <br />  not on Mahatmas exploits but our native maharajas ....Two of them <br />had <br />  a bet on how many girls they could deflower in a month (the custom <br />is <br />  virgins wear a mookuthi and removed it if they were no longer <br />  so...)one of them was able to make a crown out of it....</p>
<p>    Well that takes you back to 15th 16th century britain when the <br />  nobels had the right of PrimaNocte.. .spending the first night with <br />  all their subjects was their right.</p>
<p>    Gandhi was astute he ammassed people but it was our own Indians <br />who <br />  were against our own blood as officers and sepoys who beat all <br />those <br />  ahimsa wadis...thats where we went wrong!!!</p>
<p>    Gandhi fought for the british during the war...He gained what he <br />  needed after the war...If britain wanted to do what US is doing in <br />  Afghanistan and Iraq we would not have had any choice...because <br />they <br />  were victorious but they kept their word.</p>
<p>    The notion of Pakistan a hindu state was by a muslim student in <br />  Cambridge which even Jinnah felt was not possible...It happened</p>
<p>    The first Indo pak war was won or atleast not lost thanks to two <br />  old fellow officers talking to each other to save a great war in a <br />  country already tiorn by a partition... It was the Pakistani Chief <br />of <br />  Staff who phoned his indian counterpart both british ofcourse.</p>
<p>    The list is endless.....</p>
<p>    The bottomline We were a great nation with Heritage university <br />  Script and knowledge when the west except Rome and Greece were in <br />  caves...</p>
<p>    We let it slip in the middle thanks to false interpretation of <br />our <br />  own values it was enhanced by foreign intervention but we were to <br />  blam not them</p>
<p>    If we accept that with humility we will progress...</p>
<p>    Thanks</p>
<p>    Regards</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>There is a book by Dharampal called 'Beautiful tree'. It is an<br />online book from the website 'www.dharampal. net.' This book shows the<br />picture of Indian society in 18th century during the beginning of<br />british rule. This book is an eye opener to me and it changed many of<br />my views about british rule. It also helps me to understand the<br />lifestyle, characters and living conditions of our ancestors 200yrs<br />back and I no longer think of them as docile people who surrendered to<br />the foreign invasion without much fight. This book is relevant to this<br />current topic in discussion.I would like to know if any of you had<br />read this book and what is its impact on your opinion about India<br />under british rule.</p>

<p>Say we all agree that the British did a whole lot of good to our country.<br />Then why did whole idea of Independence start? what is the significance of<br />Aug 15th? what was the necessity to chase these 'gentlemen' out? are we<br />trying to prove a whole generation of Indians wrong by saying that we were<br />better of under the british?</p>

<p></p></blockquote>
<p>dear Ravi,</p>
<p>its just a question of scale, agree that diversity in india hinders <br />effective comparison, but again you and i are not submitting phd <br />thesis. this is just an intelletual argument and we cannot always <br />come up with a defense saying we are unique, we do need to sometimes <br />stop and look at what has transpired around us. take sin for <br />instance ( again dont shoot me down saying its a city state etc <br />etc) - its had its share of ethinic issues, lack of resources -even <br />tdy power, water, sand,vegetables/fruits...everything is <br />imported....but its political will has carried it on at a much <br />brisker pace than us ( am comparing the first formative couple of <br />decades post independance)...again i quote the man who made sin what <br />it is today - politics is not populism, politics is about <br />governance...</p>
<p>...when singapore got free, it lacked even the basic rudiments of an <br />army/police, does anyone know which country they sent their recruits <br />for training....Israel. </p>
<p>1970. they sent top delegates from to study the operations of <br />chennai port...today sin is the numero uno port of call in the world.</p>
<p>the first telgraph line connecting singapore was via chennai in the <br />late 70's.</p>
<p>when faced with the question of welfare for the aged ( they felt too <br />many people would become lazy if sponsored / sustained by the state) <br />they withdrew it..meaning you got to work if you need to eat. a <br />brave step - but a much needed one. in most cases once welfare <br />measures are put in place they are most often misused and can never <br />be taken back. it takes a lot of guts to do that. a small amount of <br />pain need to be endured for the greater good. welfare schemes need <br />to come with an auto expiry date!!</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There is a book by Dharampal called 'Beautiful tree'. It is an<br />online book from the website 'www.dharampal.net.' This book shows the<br />picture of Indian society in 18th century during the beginning of<br />british rule. This book is an eye opener to me and it changed many of<br />my views about british rule. It also helps me to understand the<br />lifestyle, characters and living conditions of our ancestors 200yrs<br />back and I no longer think of them as docile people who surrendered to<br />the foreign invasion without much fight. This book is relevant to this<br />current topic in discussion.I would like to know if any of you had<br />read this book and what is its impact on your opinion about India<br />under british rule.</p>

His major<br />mass movements are in 1920, 1930 and 1942. If you see in between years, you<br />would notice that Gandhi would have gone on pause mode. The main reason<br />being freedom movement was not having MASS SUPPORT as reported in many of<br />the articles. It is confined only to Major cities, towns, educated class<br />etc., Just apply common sense. Population of United India at that time was<br />30 crores. Did 10% of this population took part in all of the freedom<br />struggle ? Cannot be. Practically also it is not possible. But, Gandhi's<br />freedom movements did make a big impact many of the Indian masses (unlike<br />other congress leaders who did not understand the pulse of the problem).<br />Whether Gandhi's propaganda of Grama munnetram, kaiththozil, etc., will<br />take us forward ?</p>
<p>8) medicos problem - oru varusham graamaththila poi sevai pannungannu sonnaa<br />poraattaththila kudhikkiraanga. (I do not really know the gravity of the<br />problem; but the media is not allowing people to really understand both<br />sides of the issues).<br />9) See the amount of money poured into IITs by Governments; as a matter of<br />fact in all premium institutions. Let us all be honest (including myself)<br />whether we have done justice to this. What will be the cost of education (of<br />similar standards in overseas) and what we have actually paid ? Whether we<br />are returning back to the nation ?<br />We are ready to do service to the nation but there are lot of corruption,<br />bureaucracy, etc., nu jalli adikkaatheenga. Intha negative points ulla<br />nation thaan, intha inefficient government thaan majority of the educated<br />class uruvaavadharku responsible enbathai naam maranthu vidakkoodaathu.</p>
<p>Ippadi negative points eththanaiyoo irundhaalum, we have lot to cheer about<br />in the positive aspects. But none of the media is honestly putting efforts<br />in this direction. (including this forum).</p>
<p>The bottom line is "let us facts as facts". As Venkatesh rightly pointed out<br />"pushing the rubbish under the carpet does not mean everything is clean and<br />rosy".<br />We still have negatives and only thing that is making us moving forward is<br />not patriotism, i repeat it is not patriotism it is purely survival of the<br />fittest.</p>
<p>Once I read an article by Sujatha. Soldiers in the warfront do have<br />different set of mindset when they are in distress. When a co-soldier is<br />killed by an enemy gunshot, a soldier is not fired up by patriotism it is<br />his acquaintance with the co-soldier that drives the soldier to take<br />revenge. I agree to this theory.</p>

<p>  Hi Sri<br />  thanks a lot .</p>
<p>  but then i wasnt really insulted by ravi's mention of my zamindari<br />  back ground.<br />  my anscestors did so much for hindu religion and tamil culture and<br />  music that any mention of their political leanings would have no<br />  substance at all.<br />  if your anscestor was a zamindar, or a clerk in the british<br />  government it mattered the same. you had accepted their supremacy.<br />  the same went on for studying in british started schools, paying<br />the<br />  taxes. the fact is greater part of the nation had accepted british<br />  rule gladly because they knew what was happening in the<br />neighbouring<br />  princely state.it was a terrible state of affairs.<br />  even in a small state like pudukottai the british had to<br />occasionally<br />  enter the palace to chase out the hundreds of nautch girls in the<br />  palace and send the king to a sanatorium.<br />  why do we have contreversies that the national anthem jana gana<br />mana<br />  was really sung for the british emperor<br />  why was it that the freedom movement was greatly planned by UK<br />  returned leaders.</p>
<p>  and its news to me that aurangazeb was greatly tolerated by the<br />  people of india by any other emotion other than fear.</p>

<p>    Dear All<br />    I thing we are getting too emotional and personal here I think<br />Ravi<br />  owes an apology to venkat for bring his ancestors into this...<br />    Can we have a discusiion from the Head and not from the Heart<br />  blinded by fictious facts.</p>
<p>    I am not swayed one way or the other</p>
<p>    I am a proud of my country and its ancient heritage at the same<br />  time I am not blind to the facts</p>
<p>    Fact: look around the world of places colonised by the powers and<br />  whats left behind?</p>
<p>    Persions, Afghans and Mughals ...you dont see much of the ancient<br />  hindu heritage in north India...</p>
<p>    Spanish...The natives were completely wiped out of north and<br />southa<br />  merica<br />    French ....left the far east in such a state after looting them<br />  they are still in the dogs Like wise the French colonies of Africa<br />    Germany ....I think we all know our history....Well some believe<br />  hitler did it for the better ment of Aryan race...even in india<br />    America....</p>
<p>    I dont deny the fact that the British benefited from Indian<br />wealth<br />  initially it was the EIC then it was a bit moderated with the<br />  Crown....RRC did that 1000 years ago</p>
<p>    They did not have to reform certain civil inequalities. ..well<br />Sati,<br />  Child marraige and women's right werent social evil in some<br />opinions<br />  Ill reserve my opinion on that...They shouldnt have cared to change<br />  those they were hear only for the money....</p>
<p>    OOPs they did that to show how Hindu were barbarians and to<br />convert<br />  to Christianity ....Yes like the spaniards converted the whole of<br />goa<br />  into catholics...</p>
<p>    Satish<br />    Aparthied and the KKK are good examples and thats because they<br />dont<br />  considered coloured as humans at all...If we are proud to consider<br />a<br />  fellow indian as not human so we go and clean ourselves... We have<br />to<br />  be proud of ourselves... cant argue with that...<br />    I dont deny that exists even today...but still people speak out<br />and<br />  are outraged I am sure we all know of stephen lawrence case which<br />is<br />  still supported by locals...</p>
<p>    Come on I and vijay can choose the British PM just because i<br />lived<br />  in a counytry once ruled by the crown Yes a valid resident of<br />  commonwealth has voting rights in England</p>
<p>    We may all be talking Persian,Tamil, Sanskrit or whatever...Even<br />  today I get asked ''Aap Bharat mein hain Hindi kya bolnahi<br />  sakthi??'' Oh by the way matey My language is older than yours and<br />  yours is only spoken purely by four states maybe more with the<br />  dissections. ..</p>
<p>    We talked about our Half naked savior he was Ivy league type till<br />  he was brought to harsh reality in the middle of the night in a<br />train<br />  in south africa....He chose to change many dont....<br />    Do you know the support he had from the average white man in<br />  England because he was changing humanity and people recognised it<br />    You can call Tata a saviour but he was a business man</p>
<p>    You can blame the British for the Caste system, the hindu moslem<br />  issues but then if you werent fighting where was the place for the<br />  third man...If ChandaSahib and Mohamed ali didnot go to the French<br />  and English history might be different</p>
<p>    I would recomend you all to read a chapter in Freedom at Midnight<br />  not on Mahatmas exploits but our native maharajas ....Two of them<br />had<br />  a bet on how many girls they could deflower in a month (the custom<br />is<br />  virgins wear a mookuthi and removed it if they were no longer<br />  so...)one of them was able to make a crown out of it....</p>
<p>    Well that takes you back to 15th 16th century britain when the<br />  nobels had the right of PrimaNocte.. .spending the first night with<br />  all their subjects was their right.</p>
<p>    Gandhi was astute he ammassed people but it was our own Indians<br />who<br />  were against our own blood as officers and sepoys who beat all<br />those<br />  ahimsa wadis...thats where we went wrong!!!</p>
<p>    Gandhi fought for the british during the war...He gained what he<br />  needed after the war...If britain wanted to do what US is doing in<br />  Afghanistan and Iraq we would not have had any choice...because<br />they<br />  were victorious but they kept their word.</p>
<p>    The notion of Pakistan a hindu state was by a muslim student in<br />  Cambridge which even Jinnah felt was not possible...It happened</p>
<p>    The first Indo pak war was won or atleast not lost thanks to two<br />  old fellow officers talking to each other to save a great war in a<br />  country already tiorn by a partition... It was the Pakistani Chief<br />of<br />  Staff who phoned his indian counterpart both british ofcourse.</p>
<p>    The list is endless.....</p>
<p>    The bottomline We were a great nation with Heritage university<br />  Script and knowledge when the west except Rome and Greece were in<br />  caves...</p>
<p>    We let it slip in the middle thanks to false interpretation of<br />our<br />  own values it was enhanced by foreign intervention but we were to<br />  blam not them</p>
<p>    If we accept that with humility we will progress...</p>

        <p>Prior to any further note, I dont think I had insulted any one's background or ancestor. If there has been any accidental mention, I would appologize for it. <br />However there were mentions of sarcassm towards freedom fighters and Gandhi too. Emotions aside, it would be prudent to bring in Gandhi's personal life or his early life. Something that is not fair too.</p>

<p>Hi Sri<br />thanks a lot .</p>
<p>but then i wasnt really insulted by ravi's mention of my zamindari <br />back ground.<br />my anscestors did so much for hindu religion and tamil culture and <br />music that any mention of their political leanings would have no <br />substance at all.<br />if your anscestor was a zamindar, or a clerk in the british <br />government it mattered the same. you had accepted their supremacy.<br />the same went on for studying in british started schools, paying the <br />taxes. the fact is greater part of the nation had accepted british <br />rule gladly because they knew what was happening in the neighbouring <br />princely state.it was a terrible state of affairs.<br />even in a small state like pudukottai the british had to occasionally <br />enter the palace to chase out the hundreds of nautch girls in the <br />palace and send the king to a sanatorium.<br />why do we have contreversies that the national anthem jana gana mana <br />was really sung for the british emperor<br />why was it that the freedom movement was greatly planned by UK <br />returned leaders.</p>
<p>and its news to me that aurangazeb was greatly tolerated by the <br />people of india by any other emotion other than fear.</p>

<p>frankly sri I think this conversation is pointless and leading to <br />nowhere. its upto you to terminate it.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  Hi ravi<br />  you and i could go on and on without convincing each other and <br />  boring others to the bottoms of their limits.</p>
<p>  but just tell me <br />  what was the status of the entity called india in 1950, 1900, 1850, <br />  1800, 1750, 1700, before that<br />  if we honestly refer history we would know there<br />  existed no such <br />  entity.</p>
<p>  today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we <br />  should hate them.<br />  the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi <br />  driver in ajman UAE.</p>
<p>  borders change, and so does history with it.<br />  european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic <br />  tracts as single entities .<br />  indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />  while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir, <br />  or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting <br />  incompatible people.<br />  in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese <br />  and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the <br />case <br />  against them.</p>

<p>    Dear Venkatesh</p>
<p>    Your view is of a burned down India, negative critic at the best. <br />  You can keep on complaining woefully that India would have been a <br />  bunch of tribals or a ill equiped lot of villages. Well, ask the <br />  remaining of community to see who can beat spielberg in recreating <br />  history.</p>
<p>    Paying taxes or attending to schools were a force of rule. Looks <br />  like people such as your self would always prefer to be a slave to <br />  white skin and sing their lullaby anytime. </p>
<p>    Give me a single reason:<br />    Why would the so called tribal indians, who are barbaric and had <br />  been binded to so many social evils and did not speak 'one' <br />language <br />  'unite' against a massive british 'Godly' rule and take them down <br />in <br />  the path that has NEVER ever before been done in the history of the <br />  world. What made these dumb guys so patriotic that they could not <br />  tolerate the british but could<br />  tolerate every other ruler even as <br />  horrible as aurangazeb ? </p>
<p>    Oh I forgot, we were split into so many zamindars and duh how the <br />  heck did they all unite under a half naked man ? </p>
<p>    Every country has its dark age, every economy has its fall, every <br />  kingdom has to crash, every corporate has to buckle sometime, law <br />of <br />  nature. <br />    5th century to 1000 AD was british dark age, India started from <br />  1100 to 1700 - not as a dark age but as unstable period. 1300 - <br />1600 <br />  was mugal peak time, there were a lot of disturbances (many people <br />  opposing the mugal autocratic rule) during that time when the <br />country <br />  was 'rediscovering' itself, which people like you conveniently call <br />  as ignorance. India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals <br />ruled <br />  for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250. <br />  Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many <br />  states, so what ? US is 50+ states,<br />  china was so many states the <br />  biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of <br />  the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma. Sanskrit was <br />  spoken widely before the british split us, tamil was in tamil <br />  heartland, we used to speak many languages in indian country. </p>
<p>    Ghori / Ghazni plundered the country, we bounced back, mughals <br />  tried to break the hindu culture and failed miserably, Nadir shah <br />  ripped us we rebound back.... then came the british, fresh out of <br />  their dark age, exploring new territories looking for places were <br />  they can spread their culture, education (as if no one else was <br />  educated), systematically ripped us of our minds and caused people <br />  such as yourself who believe in their dominion after 60 years. <br />Whilst <br />  you speak of us going the African way, why wont you think of us <br />going <br />  the Chinese way ? There lies a mind set, again british preset.</p>
<p>    India, an internal<br />  economy, there in was her strength, the british <br />  wanted to develop their country and started levying heavy taxes on <br />  Indian goods and exported european goods. Coincided with the <br />  industrial revolution in england...fact or fiction ? Read the <br />  Imperial Gazzetter of 1881:<br />    some experts<br />    1903-04 Data is Lakh Rupees (Rupees of that Era)<br />    Items Imports Exports (Textile)<br />    Apparels 172 16<br />    Raw Cotton 5 2438<br />    Cotton Goods 31288 10<br />    Wool Items 215 27<br />    My country paid (imported) Rs 31,680 lakhs and sold (exported) <br />  Rs.2500 lakh... rocket science on the numbers. This is only in <br />  textile, go for many many other imports and exports you will see <br />that <br />  a billion of dollar value would be transfered every damn year for <br />100 <br />  years of british rule, and here we have patrons to be so happy with <br />  their rule.</p>
<p>    Gandhi systematically counteracted them by dismantling their <br />  managerial capacities,<br />  hitting them where it mattered the most, Tata <br />  built its steel plant and rose against the empire, luckily for <br />Tata, <br />  they happened to find customers in british during WW II. Gandhi and <br />  Tata worked closely in removing the steel trade of british from <br />  India. Check the public documents of Birmingham and Sheffield. <br />    Next - salt, monopoly of salt trade, british hit us with that and <br />  that was when our power as a nation moved full surge ahead. <br />    You can be proud that we helped england rebuild itself with our <br />  money. <br />    And coming to think of the tribal chieftains, they are still <br />  available today... they just kept changing names.. from sitrarasan <br />of <br />  chola period to chieftains of mugal rules to zamindars of british <br />  rule to MLA's of republic of India. We are still at war with our <br />  neighbors, for water for trade for space for land etc... We will <br />  always be at war, it is our family, we will come to a compromise <br />  today or<br />  tomorrow. your motive says that just because karnataka wont <br />  release water, get whites to rule us.... how cool! </p>
<p>    This is a great country, no matter how many people work hard on <br />  demotivating us or plundering us, we will prove our mettle. One <br />thing <br />  is for sure, it is immaterial if Maculay really said his famous <br />quote <br />  in 1835, what is alleged definitely is happening today. They have <br />  successfully planted their domain in minds of many indians. It is <br />  another test for the great nation and I am sure she will come good <br />as  <br />  usual.</p>

<p>    Hi Venu<br />    I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />    thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid <br />their <br />    taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.</p>
<p>    most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs <br />who <br />    saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh <br />  war. <br />    the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />    what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful <br />    nation called india in say 1600.<br />    if you were born in 1600 ( or as you say 1970 if the british had <br />  not <br />    come at all) you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of <br />    pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of <br />  ramnad <br />    or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of </p>
<p>  madurai.<br />    that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />    you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great <br />  show <br />    of unity united on their own in the national interest and then <br />  opened <br />    negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of <br />    hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of <br />tranvancore, <br />    the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin. <br />    this would have united south india.<br />    then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern <br />  hindu <br />    muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings( ar you will <br />be <br />    calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon) <br />to <br />    unite one democratic nation called india.<br />    you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />    even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the <br />  sardar <br />    to join the indian confedration.<br />    the<br />  maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and <br />    you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and <br />pelf <br />  so <br />    that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />    its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.</p>
<p>    have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things <br />exisited <br />    in this part of the world along with the social evils we have <br />been <br />    discussing.</p>
<p>    to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />    trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>    patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should <br />  not <br />    be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>    what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or <br />  the <br />    slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un <br />  united <br />    india.<br />    regards<br />    venketesh</p>
<p>      Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a <br />barbaric <br />    tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in <br />a <br />    shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... <br />  pathetic <br />    and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how <br />    people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence <br />  India <br />    is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is <br />    childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<p>      Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, <br />untouchability, <br />    child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and <br />clearly <br />    set afire by the British. </p>
<p>      Sati: <br />      1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core <br />  of <br />    issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British <br />never <br />    allow any controversy to brew,excellent management<br />  strategy, i have <br />    added more points below.)<br />      2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at <br />    that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. <br />  honestly <br />    how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows <br />life <br />    is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />    treatment she gets even today.<br />      We had been a warring community according to some,by logic,  <br />where <br />    there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, <br />    there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />    during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />      The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was <br />opted <br />    by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they <br />have <br />    lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />    1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out<br />  of <br />    compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />    hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to <br />do <br />    with western explorers landing in India...)<br />      Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It <br />ties <br />    up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like <br />now <br />    where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<p>      Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a <br />    concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the <br />    middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not <br />  open. <br />    Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />    etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />    book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />    untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />    1000 years now. It is not<br />  called untouchability now, it has a new <br />    definition as caste politics now.</p>
<p>      Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan <br />  kaamanai <br />    vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, <br />during <br />    the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model <br />of <br />    Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />    their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' <br />  was <br />    to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />    reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to <br />think <br />    what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, <br />  dating <br />    was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />    reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western <br />model <br />    and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where <br />sex <br />  is <br />    taboo. We know what many<br />  teens of our era are doing vs what our <br />  great <br />    grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they <br />  were <br />    children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. <br />Compare <br />    the success of child<br />      mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out <br />  dated <br />    concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) <br />to <br />    follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an <br />answer <br />    our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, <br />where <br />    girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. <br />    Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />    internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or <br />the <br />    energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />    'talent'. </p>
<p>      A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the <br />    African way. I<br />  would first need to know if that is a serious <br />  comment <br />    or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />    understand the basics of India can really try very hard and <br />compare <br />    India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one <br />  serious <br />    literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations <br />  in <br />    Africa is more or less degrading my country. </p>
<p>      A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really <br />did, <br />    by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy <br />    trains vs the TUBE in london).<br />      There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant <br />  management <br />    people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />      people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard <br />like <br />    dyre or jackson the<br />      british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />      supporters of<br />  the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have <br />    even<br />      caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the <br />  british <br />    to rethink a motive. That<br />      is management strategy not to be confused as 'Oh Almighty <br />British <br />  - <br />    I see your Grace in the bread we eat'.</p>
<p>      Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - <br />english<br />      patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on <br />  india <br />    was<br />      definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read <br />    Kalki's<br />      comments on Churchill's thoughts on India. Make no mistake, <br />  Britain <br />    is a great country for the British, but to even think that they <br />  were <br />    the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. </p>
<p>      Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are</p>
<p>  worthless <br />    and sing<br />      hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the <br />India <br />    does<br />      not exist without the west. </p>
<p>      Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here <br />is<br />      equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain <br />  is <br />    Europe's crime<br />      hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation <br />    recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It <br />is <br />    like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them <br />  making <br />    mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather <br />  than <br />    adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<p>      A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more <br />  worry.<br />      What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor <br />  citizens<br />      who helped the british then, only that we are<br />  all indians.</p>
<p>      I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the <br />real <br />    Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>      On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british <br />  able <br />    to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were <br />    Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have <br />  an <br />    idea now. </p>

<p>      Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>      I would definitely be against all your points. What you <br />  described, <br />    may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the <br />    characteristics of india.</p>
<p>      I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in <br />capturing <br />    our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak <br />ill <br />    of ourself.</p>
<p>      Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>      1) The Sati system<br />      The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />    Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the <br />  women.<br />      Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />    areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request <br />  you <br />    to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke <br />to <br />  a <br />    women committing sati. (page#8 in<br />  the following link)</p>
<p>      <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /<br />vol1.pdf </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>      2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>      I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />    this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. <br />We <br />    should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the <br />  dress <br />    style is entirely different..</p>
<p>      3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>      This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />    Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower <br />    caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, <br />the <br />    SC castes do not drink water in other SC<br />  caste's family.</p>
<p>      Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than <br />those <br />    semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in <br />  india, <br />    the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />    semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>      The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british <br />creation. </p>
<p>      4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>      Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />    ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools <br />  in <br />    Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />    today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.<br />      The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />    all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>      You can find more details in the following book of<br />  dharampal.</p>
<p>      <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /<br />  3beautiful- <br />    tree.zip </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>      5) Fate of widows<br />      You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />    they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the <br />    western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th <br />    century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>      6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>      Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />    were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the <br />    devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />      <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>      The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with <br />the <br />    highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as <br />    sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />    devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />    choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. <br />  the <br />    concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism <br />  effect.)</p>
<p>      See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the <br />  bharatanatyam, <br />    were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, <br />like <br />    lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />      Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />    prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam <br />    cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are<br />  degraded <br />  to <br />    prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />    rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<p>      7. Slavery:<br />      Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point <br />of <br />    time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim <br />invaders.</p>
<p>      8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>      Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />    usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close <br />    relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that <br />the <br />    girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The <br />    girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her <br />    childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<p>      Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />    days.</p>
<p>      "When comparing to the<br />  sexual abuse of girl child happening in <br />  the <br />    west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>      If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on <br />why <br />    it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>      9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>      Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, <br />  and <br />    spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every <br />    profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested <br />  with <br />    brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />    vellalars.</p>
<p>      also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to <br />be <br />    priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of <br />    untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>      So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few <br />    castes are allowed.. its not<br />  like that.. the people who performed <br />    priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our <br />country.</p>
<p>      10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>      This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all <br />our <br />    mother tongues..</p>
<p>      11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>      Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that <br />the <br />    animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its <br />  sacrificed <br />    in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. </p>
<p>      Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated <br />    slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />      Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own <br />    community (not to our god..) according to tradition is <br />barbarious, <br />    and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>  Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>      Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like <br />  that, <br />    let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>      we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>      I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who <br />    committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa <br />    Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, <br />    committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<p>      <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br />      <http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>      Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which <br />one</p>
<p>    is barbaric. </p>
<p>      No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its <br />really <br />    a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form  <br />of <br />  our <br />    culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we <br />going <br />    to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a <br />    paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, <br />    still india is our only land for us)</p>

<p>        The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />        about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />        really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />        those modern thinking, some of the elements of<br />  our<br />        society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />        today, when compared with contemporary nations:</p>
<p>        1) The Sati system<br />        2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />        garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />        3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />        4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />        5) Fate of widows<br />        6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />        devadasi system<br />        7) Slavery<br />        8) Marriage at childhood<br />        9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />        10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />        11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>        But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />        main crux to<br />  be focussed. </p>
<p>        The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />        children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />        pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />        truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />        enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />        should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />        illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />        they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

        <p>Hi<br />I always felt history books should be read like physics or chemistry <br />books. then you dont get emotional about boyle's law.</p>
<p>the resistance against mughals, men riding out to the last battle and <br />the women commiting jauhar is still acknowledged in the west and <br />north parts of india. to them its more emotional than the struggle <br />against the british.</p>
<p>the war against the mughals by the sikhs, rajputs, and the marattas <br />was eternal. it was an on going process for 300 years.<br />the shiv sena is based on those ideals.<br />the hindu muslim issues including babri masjid are ofshoots of those.</p>
<p>people blame the british for the india pakistan divide. but just <br />imagine with a 17 percent population we have so much friction. what <br />if they had occupied 45 percent in an udivided india.</p>

        <p>Hello...what is there to contradict ? British were monarch's... india is a natural democracy. british looted and systematically broke us down. British took our culture and portrayed us like barbarians...and unfortunately many indians find pleasure in that. <br />We never fought against any of the other rulers as a unit, but we did against british as a nation... <br />We have been debating the ghajini gori's of british india and from this part of the river it looks like you have been arguing to stake the british claim.</p>

<p>Dear Sridhar</p>
<p>I sure do not<br />understand your point... Aurangazeb vs Sivaji was not a national struggle nor was Kalinga vs Ashoka... our freedom struggle was unique, we wanted a new country under our native dharma... that is why Gandhi is a name that sells.</p>
<p>Ashoka figured that out and took over ahimsa himself...fyi.</p>
<p>This Bharatam cannot be slaved or ruled by monarch's, we can only work by the law of dharma...which may sound stupid to overcivilized individuals but I am sure it makes sense to a lot of other people.</p>

<p>Dear Ravi<br />I am afraid your arguement is hollow</p>
<p>Tamilnadu is just one example...you just have to turn into history books to see the sects and sections good example rajputs...marathas. ..</p>
<p>Who said people didnt fight against them <br />History books again Kalingas resisted Ashoka...Bloody War<br />Pulikesin resisted Harshavardana<br />Sivaji fought Aurangazeb.. ...</p>
<p>The only difference between Then and the British for 300 years the Indians<br />were enslaved the free ones that is under the british and joined a man who cared for them....<br />the Maharajas were still bystnaders negotiating their future with the brits...OOOps the enemies</p>

<p>:-) Agreed to that point. <br />And it is true that I will never accept the supremacy of the crown.</p>
<p>Pakistan vs India is something of a different ghost and<br />again points to british (may be i can give them credit for a useful side effect).</p>
<p>What was india called before ... this is funny, it just shows that your argument is very very limited to tamil nadu, i dont blame it but then thats what the english achieved. There was a country called 'BHARAT' or as we say ' Bharatam'. Does the name Bharatham make any sense ?</p>
<p>Read thirupugazh (1400 AD) and you will know how much of sanskrit and other bharat languages are mixed in that... mixing up dark ages with the light of a train coming out of a dark tunnel is not in the best interests of bharat.</p>

<p>Hi ravi<br />you and i could go on and on without convincing each other and <br />boring others to the bottoms of their limits.</p>
<p>but just tell me <br />what was the status of the entity called india in 1950, 1900, 1850, <br />1800, 1750, 1700, before that<br />if we honestly refer history we would know there<br />existed no such <br />entity.</p>
<p>today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we <br />should hate them.<br />the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi <br />driver in ajman UAE.</p>
<p>borders change, and so does history with it.<br />european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic <br />tracts as single entities .<br />indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir, <br />or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting <br />incompatible people.<br />in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese <br />and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the case <br />against them.</p>

Yes we were many <br />states, so what ? US is 50+ states,<br />china was so many states the <br />biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of <br />the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma.

<p>  have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited <br />  in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been <br />  discussing.</p>
<p>  to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />  trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>  patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should <br />not <br />  be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>  what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or <br />the <br />  slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un <br />united <br />  india.<br />  regards<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric <br />  tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a <br />  shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... <br />pathetic <br />  and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how <br />  people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence <br />India <br />  is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is <br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<p>    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability, <br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly <br />  set afire by the British. </p>
<p>    Sati: <br />    1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core <br />of <br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British never <br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management<br />strategy, i have <br />  added more points below.)<br />    2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at <br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. <br />honestly <br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life <br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where <br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, <br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted <br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have <br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />  1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out<br />of <br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />  hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do <br />  with western explorers landing in India...)<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It ties <br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now <br />  where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<p>    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a <br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the <br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not <br />open. <br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />  1000 years now. It is not<br />called untouchability now, it has a new <br />  definition as caste politics now.</p>
<p>    Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan <br />kaamanai <br />  vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during <br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of <br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' <br />was <br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think <br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, <br />dating <br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model <br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex <br />is <br />  taboo. We know what many<br />teens of our era are doing vs what our </p></blockquote>
<p>great </p>
<blockquote><p>  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they <br />were <br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare <br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out <br />dated <br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) to <br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer <br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where <br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. <br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the <br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />  'talent'. </p>
<p>    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the <br />  African way. I<br />would first need to know if that is a serious </p></blockquote>
<p>comment </p>
<blockquote><p>  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare <br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one <br />serious <br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations <br />in <br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country. </p>
<p>    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did, <br />  by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy <br />  trains vs the TUBE in london).<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant <br />management <br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like <br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of<br />the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have <br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the <br />british <br />  to rethink a motive.

Make no mistake, <br />Britain <br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they <br />were <br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. </p>

<p>    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain <br />is <br />  Europe's crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation <br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is <br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them <br />making <br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather <br />than <br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<p>    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more <br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor <br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are<br />all indians.</p>
<p>    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real <br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british <br />able <br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were <br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have <br />an <br />  idea now. </p>

<p>    Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>    I would definitely be against all your points. What you <br />described, <br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the <br />  characteristics of india.</p>
<p>    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing <br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill <br />  of ourself.</p>
<p>    Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>    1) The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the <br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request <br />you <br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to <br />a <br />  women committing sati. (page#8 in<br />the following link)</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>    2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We <br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the <br />dress <br />  style is entirely different..</p>
<p>    3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower <br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the <br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC<br />caste's family.</p>
<p>    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those <br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in <br />india, <br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation. </p>
<p>    4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />  ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools <br />in <br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />  today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />  all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>    You can find more details in the following book of<br />dharampal.</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /<br />3beautiful- <br />  tree.zip </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>    5) Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the <br />  western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th <br />  century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>    6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the <br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the <br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as <br />  sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. <br />the <br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism <br />effect.)</p>
<p>    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the <br />bharatanatyam, <br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like <br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam <br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are<br />degraded </p></http://www.samanvay></p></blockquote>
<p>to </p>
<blockquote><p>  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<p>    7. Slavery:<br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of <br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>    8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>    Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close <br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the <br />  girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The <br />  girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her <br />  childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<p>    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />  days.</p>
<p>    "When comparing to the<br />sexual abuse of girl child happening in </p></blockquote>
<p>the </p>
<blockquote><p>  west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why <br />  it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>    9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, <br />and <br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every <br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested <br />with <br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />  vellalars.</p>
<p>    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be <br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of <br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few <br />  castes are allowed.. its not<br />like that.. the people who performed <br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>    10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our <br />  mother tongues..</p>
<p>    11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the <br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its <br />sacrificed <br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. </p>
<p>    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated <br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own <br />  community (not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, <br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like <br />that, <br />  let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who <br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa <br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, <br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<p>    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br />    <http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one</p>
<p>  is barbaric. </p>
<p>    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really <br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of <br />our <br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going <br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a <br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, <br />  still india is our only land for us)</p>

<p>      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers.

<p>      But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />      main crux to<br />be focussed. </p>
<p>      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage.

<p>I sure do not understand your point... Aurangazeb vs Sivaji was not a national struggle nor was Kalinga vs Ashoka... our freedom struggle was unique, we wanted a new country under our native dharma... that is why Gandhi is a name that sells.</p>
<p>Ashoka figured that out and took over ahimsa himself...fyi.</p>
<p>This Bharatam cannot be slaved or ruled by monarch's, we can only work by the law of dharma...which may sound stupid to overcivilized individuals but I am sure it makes sense to a lot of other people.</p>

<p>Dear Ravi<br />I am afraid your arguement is hollow</p>
<p>Tamilnadu is just one example...you just have to turn into history books to see the sects and sections good example rajputs...marathas. ..</p>
<p>Who said people didnt fight against them <br />History books again Kalingas resisted Ashoka...Bloody War<br />Pulikesin resisted Harshavardana<br />Sivaji fought Aurangazeb.. ...</p>
<p>The only difference between Then and the British for 300 years the Indians were enslaved the free ones that is under the british and joined a man who cared for them....<br />the Maharajas were still bystnaders negotiating their future with the brits...OOOps the enemies</p>

<p>:-) Agreed to that point. <br />And it is true that I will never accept the supremacy of the crown.</p>
<p>Pakistan vs India is something of a different ghost and again points to british (may be i can give them credit for a useful side effect).</p>
<p>What was india called before ... this is funny, it just shows that your argument is very very limited to tamil nadu, i dont blame it but then thats what the english achieved. There was a country called 'BHARAT' or as we say ' Bharatam'. Does the name Bharatham make any sense ?</p>
<p>Read thirupugazh (1400 AD) and you will know how much of sanskrit and other bharat languages are mixed in that... mixing up dark ages with the light of a train coming out of a dark tunnel is not in the best interests of bharat.</p>

<p>Hi ravi<br />you and i could go on and on without convincing each other and <br />boring others to the bottoms of their limits.</p>
<p>but just tell me <br />what was the status of the entity called india in 1950, 1900, 1850, <br />1800, 1750, 1700, before that<br />if we honestly refer history we would know there existed no such <br />entity.</p>
<p>today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we <br />should hate them.<br />the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi <br />driver in ajman UAE.</p>
<p>borders change, and so does history with it.<br />european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic <br />tracts as single entities .<br />indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir, <br />or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting <br />incompatible people.<br />in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese <br />and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the case <br />against them.</p>

<p>was mugal peak time, there were a lot of disturbances (many people <br />opposing the mugal autocratic rule) during that time when the country <br />was 'rediscovering' itself, which people like you conveniently call <br />as ignorance. India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals ruled <br />for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250. <br />Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many <br />states, so what ? US is 50+ states, china was so many states the <br />biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of <br />the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma. Sanskrit was <br />spoken widely before the british split us, tamil was in tamil <br />heartland, we used to speak many languages in indian country. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Ghori / Ghazni plundered the country, we bounced back, mughals <br />tried to break the hindu culture and failed miserably, Nadir shah </p></blockquote>
<p>ripped us we rebound back.... then came the british, fresh out of <br />their dark age, exploring new territories looking for places were <br />they can spread their culture, education (as if no one else was <br />educated), systematically ripped us of our minds and caused people <br />such as yourself who believe in their dominion after 60 years. Whilst <br />you speak of us going the African way, why wont you think of us going <br />the Chinese way ? There lies a mind set, again british preset.</p>

<p>textile, go for many many other imports and exports you will see that <br />a billion of dollar value would be transfered every damn year for 100 <br />years of british rule, and here we have patrons to be so happy with <br />their rule.</p>

<p>  most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs who <br />  saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh <br />war. <br />  the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />  what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful <br />  nation called india in say 1600.<br />  if you were born in 1600 ( or as you say 1970 if the british had <br />not <br />  come at all) you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of <br />  pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of <br />ramnad <br />  or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of <br />  madurai.<br />  that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />  you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great <br />show <br />  of unity united on their own in the national interest and then <br />opened <br />  negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of <br />  hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of tranvancore, <br />  the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin. <br />  this would have united south india.<br />  then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern <br />hindu <br />  muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings( ar you will be <br />  calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon) to <br />  unite one democratic nation called india.<br />  you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />  even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the <br />sardar <br />  to join the indian confedration.<br />  the maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and <br />  you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and pelf <br />so <br />  that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />  its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.</p>
<p>  have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited <br />  in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been <br />  discussing.</p>
<p>  to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />  trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>  patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should <br />not <br />  be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>  what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or <br />the <br />  slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un <br />united <br />  india.<br />  regards<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric <br />  tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a <br />  shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... <br />pathetic <br />  and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how <br />  people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence <br />India <br />  is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is <br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<p>    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability, <br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly <br />  set afire by the British. </p>
<p>    Sati: <br />    1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core <br />of <br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British never <br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have <br />  added more points below.)<br />    2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at <br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. <br />honestly <br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life <br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where <br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, <br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted <br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have <br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />  1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of <br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />  hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do <br />  with western explorers landing in India...)<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It ties <br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now <br />  where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<p>    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a <br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the <br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not <br />open. <br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />  1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new <br />  definition as caste politics now.</p>
<p>    Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan <br />kaamanai <br />  vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during <br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of <br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' <br />was <br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think <br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, <br />dating <br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model <br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex <br />is <br />  taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our <br />great <br />  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they <br />were <br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare <br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out <br />dated <br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) to <br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer <br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where <br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. <br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the <br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />  'talent'. </p>
<p>    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the <br />  African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious <br />comment <br />  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare <br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one <br />serious <br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations <br />in <br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country. </p>
<p>    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did, <br />  by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy <br />  trains vs the TUBE in london).<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant <br />management <br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like <br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have <br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the <br />british <br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as 'Oh Almighty British <br />- <br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat'.</p>
<p>    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on <br />india <br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read <br />  Kalki's<br />    comments on Churchill's thoughts on India. Make no mistake, <br />Britain <br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they <br />were <br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. </p>
<p>    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are <br />worthless <br />  and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India <br />  does<br />    not exist without the west. </p>
<p>    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain <br />is <br />  Europe's crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation <br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is <br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them <br />making <br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather <br />than <br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<p>    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more <br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor <br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.</p>
<p>    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real <br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british <br />able <br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were <br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have <br />an <br />  idea now. </p>

<p>    Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>    I would definitely be against all your points. What you <br />described, <br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the <br />  characteristics of india.</p>
<p>    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing <br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill <br />  of ourself.</p>
<p>    Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>    1) The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the <br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request <br />you <br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to <br />a <br />  women committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>    2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We <br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the <br />dress <br />  style is entirely different..</p>
<p>    3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower <br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the <br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<p>    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those <br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in <br />india, <br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation. </p>
<p>    4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />  ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools <br />in <br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />  today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />  all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>    You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /<br />3beautiful- <br />  tree.zip </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>    5) Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the <br />  western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th <br />  century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>    6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the <br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the <br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as <br />  sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. <br />the <br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism <br />effect.)</p>
<p>    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the <br />bharatanatyam, <br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like <br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam <br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded <br />to <br />  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<p>    7. Slavery:<br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of <br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>    8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>    Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close <br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the <br />  girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The <br />  girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her <br />  childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<p>    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />  days.</p>
<p>    "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in <br />the <br />  west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why <br />  it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>    9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, <br />and <br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every <br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested <br />with <br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />  vellalars.</p>
<p>    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be <br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of <br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few <br />  castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed <br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>    10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our <br />  mother tongues..</p>
<p>    11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the <br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its <br />sacrificed <br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. </p>
<p>    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated <br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own <br />  community (not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, <br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>    Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like <br />that, <br />  let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who <br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa <br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, <br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<p>    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br />    <http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one <br />  is barbaric. </p>
<p>    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really <br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of <br />our <br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going <br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a <br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, <br />  still india is our only land for us)</p>

<p>      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />      those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />      society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />      today, when compared with contemporary nations:</p>
<p>      1) The Sati system<br />      2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />      garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />      3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />      4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />      5) Fate of widows<br />      6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />      devadasi system<br />      7) Slavery<br />      8) Marriage at childhood<br />      9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />      10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />      11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>      But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />      main crux to be focussed. </p>
<p>      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

        <p>Dear Sridhar</p>
<p>I sure do not understand your point... Aurangazeb vs Sivaji was not a national struggle nor was Kalinga vs Ashoka... our freedom struggle was unique, we wanted a new country under our native dharma... that is why Gandhi is a name that sells.</p>
<p>Ashoka figured that out and took over ahimsa himself...fyi.</p>
<p>This Bharatam cannot be slaved or ruled by monarch's, we can only work by the law of dharma...which may sound stupid to overcivilized individuals but I am sure it makes sense to a lot of other people.</p>

<p>Dear Ravi<br />I am afraid your arguement is hollow</p>
<p>Tamilnadu is just one example...you just have to turn into history books to see the sects and sections good example rajputs...marathas. ..</p>
<p>Who said people didnt fight against them <br />History books again Kalingas resisted Ashoka...Bloody War<br />Pulikesin resisted Harshavardana<br />Sivaji fought Aurangazeb.. ...</p>
<p>The only difference between Then and the British for 300 years the Indians were enslaved the free ones that is under the british and joined a man who cared for them....<br />the Maharajas were still bystnaders negotiating their future with the brits...OOOps the enemies</p>

<p>Pakistan vs India is something of a different ghost and again points to british (may be i can give them credit for a useful side effect).</p>
<p>What was india called before ... this is funny, it just shows that your argument is very very limited to tamil nadu, i dont blame it but then thats what the english achieved. There was a country called 'BHARAT' or as we say ' Bharatam'. Does the name Bharatham make any sense ?</p>
<p>Read thirupugazh (1400 AD) and you will know how much of sanskrit and other bharat languages are mixed in that... mixing up dark ages with the light of a train coming out of a dark tunnel is not in the best interests of bharat.</p>

<p>Hi ravi<br />you and i could go on and on without convincing each other and <br />boring others to the bottoms of their limits.</p>
<p>but just tell me <br />what was the status of the entity called india in 1950, 1900, 1850, <br />1800, 1750, 1700, before that<br />if we honestly refer history we would know there existed no such <br />entity.</p>
<p>today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we <br />should hate them.<br />the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi <br />driver in ajman UAE.</p>
<p>borders change, and so does history with it.<br />european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic <br />tracts as single entities .<br />indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir, <br />or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting <br />incompatible people.<br />in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese <br />and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the case <br />against them.</p>

India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals ruled <br />for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250. <br />Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many <br />states, so what ? US is 50+ states, china was so many states the <br />biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of <br />the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma.

<p>  Hi Venu<br />  I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />  thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid their <br />  taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.</p>
<p>  most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs who <br />  saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh <br />war. <br />  the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />  what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful <br />  nation called india in say 1600.<br />  if you were born in 1600 ( or as you say 1970 if the british had <br />not <br />  come at all) you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of <br />  pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of <br />ramnad <br />  or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of <br />  madurai.<br />  that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />  you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great <br />show <br />  of unity united on their own in the national interest and then <br />opened <br />  negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of <br />  hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of tranvancore, <br />  the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin. <br />  this would have united south india.<br />  then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern <br />hindu <br />  muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings( ar you will be <br />  calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon) to <br />  unite one democratic nation called india.<br />  you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />  even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the <br />sardar <br />  to join the indian confedration.<br />  the maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and <br />  you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and pelf <br />so <br />  that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />  its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.</p>
<p>  have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited <br />  in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been <br />  discussing.</p>
<p>  to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />  trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>  patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should <br />not <br />  be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>  what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or <br />the <br />  slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un <br />united <br />  india.<br />  regards<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric <br />  tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a <br />  shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... <br />pathetic <br />  and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how <br />  people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence <br />India <br />  is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is <br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<p>    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability, <br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly <br />  set afire by the British. </p>
<p>    Sati: <br />    1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core <br />of <br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British never <br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have <br />  added more points below.)<br />    2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at <br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. <br />honestly <br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life <br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where <br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, <br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted <br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have <br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />  1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of <br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />  hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do <br />  with western explorers landing in India...)<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It ties <br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now <br />  where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<p>    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a <br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the <br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not <br />open. <br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />  1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new <br />  definition as caste politics now.</p>
<p>    Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan <br />kaamanai <br />  vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during <br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of <br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' <br />was <br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think <br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, <br />dating <br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model <br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex <br />is <br />  taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our <br />great <br />  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they <br />were <br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare <br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out <br />dated <br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) to <br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer <br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where <br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. <br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the <br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />  'talent'. </p>
<p>    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the <br />  African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious <br />comment <br />  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare <br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one <br />serious <br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations <br />in <br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country. </p>
<p>    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did, <br />  by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy <br />  trains vs the TUBE in london).<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant <br />management <br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like <br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have <br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the <br />british <br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as 'Oh Almighty British <br />- <br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat'.</p>
<p>    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on <br />india <br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read <br />  Kalki's<br />    comments on Churchill's thoughts on India. Make no mistake, <br />Britain <br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they <br />were <br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. </p>
<p>    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are <br />worthless <br />  and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India <br />  does<br />    not exist without the west. </p>
<p>    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain <br />is <br />  Europe's crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation <br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is <br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them <br />making <br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather <br />than <br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<p>    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more <br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor <br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.</p>
<p>    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real <br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british <br />able <br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were <br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have <br />an <br />  idea now. </p>

<p>    Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>    I would definitely be against all your points. What you <br />described, <br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the <br />  characteristics of india.</p>
<p>    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing <br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill <br />  of ourself.</p>
<p>    Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>    1) The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the <br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request <br />you <br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to <br />a <br />  women committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>    2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We <br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the <br />dress <br />  style is entirely different..</p>
<p>    3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower <br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the <br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<p>    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those <br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in <br />india, <br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation. </p>
<p>    4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />  ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools <br />in <br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />  today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />  all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>    You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>

<p>    5) Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the <br />  western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th <br />  century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>    6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the <br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the <br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as <br />  sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. <br />the <br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism <br />effect.)</p>
<p>    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the <br />bharatanatyam, <br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like <br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam <br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded <br />to <br />  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<p>    7. Slavery:<br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of <br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>    8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>    Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close <br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the <br />  girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The <br />  girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her <br />  childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<p>    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />  days.</p>
<p>    "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in <br />the <br />  west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why <br />  it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>    9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, <br />and <br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every <br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested <br />with <br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />  vellalars.</p>
<p>    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be <br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of <br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few <br />  castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed <br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>    10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our <br />  mother tongues..</p>
<p>    11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the <br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its <br />sacrificed <br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. </p>
<p>    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated <br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own <br />  community (not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, <br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>    Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like <br />that, <br />  let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who <br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa <br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, <br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<p>    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br />    <http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one <br />  is barbaric. </p>
<p>    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really <br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of <br />our <br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going <br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a <br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, <br />  still india is our only land for us)</p>

<p>      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />      those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />      society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />      today, when compared with contemporary nations:</p>
<p>      1) The Sati system<br />      2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />      garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />      3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />      4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />      5) Fate of widows<br />      6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />      devadasi system<br />      7) Slavery<br />      8) Marriage at childhood<br />      9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />      10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />      11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>      But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />      main crux to be focussed. </p>
<p>      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Here i will be using your last line as my first.</p>
<p>If we accept that with humility we will progress...<br />Humility is our main weapon, as citizens of bharat, we all humble enough to have accepted many rulers and many opinions, bharat is a natural democracy, kings were a part of the democracy. They assumed they were monarch and we were blinded by that over time. Our shanmadhams are common across the country from afganistan to srilanka there are temples, I consider temples that were atleast 3000 years old to start with, how did the people so far and across pray the same god as the people down south ? If we were never united how did that happen ?</p>
<blockquote><p>   We may all be talking Persian,Tamil, Sanskrit or whatever...Even today I get asked ''Aap Bharat mein hain Hindi kya bolnahi sakthi??'' Oh by the way matey My language is older than yours and yours is only spoken purely by four states maybe more with the dissections. ..<br />So this goes into a language discussion ? I dont remember language being a barrier when Vatapi was conquered and when gangai konda cholapuram was built or saraboji ruled south.... the british could not understand what the heck we speak or how the hell we communicated... hence the rift was build. Please read Feb 19th 1835 UK parliment address of Lord Maculay. Today they accomplished something that is amazing, many of us do not know what is north about...we all know a laloo or a ambani or a nandhigram but there will be avatars at every place, which we fail to recognize.</p></blockquote>
<p>Krishna's statement ' I will be there when adharma rules' has always been true, except that He does not show up in blue color with a chakra / bow n arrow on his hand. Cholas were drowned by Jatavarma pandyan... Mugals were countered by Shivaji... after aurangazeb they declined and British came in, which is in a way a balance to what was happening for a short period when Bharat shook. Unless Duryodhana had taken up the pandava land we would not have the Gita. Our argument is saying just because we have the Gita - duryodhana was rule was the best and pandavas were in a polyandry situation so they are evil... :-) the bigger scheme of things...</p>
<p>We talked about our Half naked savior he was Ivy league type till he was brought to harsh reality in the middle of the night in a train in south africa....He chose to change many dont....<br />Do you know the support he had from the average white man in England because he was changing humanity and people recognised it <br />You can call Tata a saviour but he was a business man</p>
<blockquote><p>   Does it matter ? Arunagiri was a womanizer prior to writing thirupugazh, valmiki was a thief prior to writing ramayana... so what ? It is not the question of what we did, but how soon we realize and what happened after that. Like I said, there are sensible people across the globe. There are honest god and peace abiding citizens everywhere, they see the difference between how or what is happening, the public opinion is bound to go towards the supressed and justice. The concept of public jury in the US lives and is a great way of providing justice. <br />India has a lot to offer the world, it will and it does. Yes, there is the western culture that is dominating us now and we are falling for that, earlier they took our money and now they are dismantling our culture (not the one that a few people talk of deflowering or later end of devadasi cultures). A part of western process was to lure the concept of lust , greed and arrogance into our country. The very concept our shanmadhams fight against. </p></blockquote>
<p>I would recomend you all to read a chapter in Freedom at Midnight not on Mahatmas exploits but our native maharajas ....Two of them had a bet on how many girls they could deflower in a month (the custom is virgins wear a mookuthi and removed it if they were no longer so...)one of them was able to make a crown out of it....</p>
<blockquote><p>   Wow that is disgusting... wondering who wrote it ? lapierre and collins... hmmm.. I would not even be surprised if Mountbatten funded the tennis courts and academies they built. Again, we accept anything we get. What Gandhi did in his personal life is of no consequence to us and it would be vulgar to think follow collins into 'gandhi and his 'girls' ' concepts. </p></blockquote>
<p>Well that takes you back to 15th 16th century britain when the nobels had the right of PrimaNocte.. .spending the first night with all their subjects was their right.</p>

<p>Gandhi was astute he ammassed people but it was our own Indians who were against our own blood as officers and sepoys who beat all those ahimsa wadis...thats where we went wrong!!!</p>

<p>Gandhi fought for the british during the war...He gained what he needed after the war...If britain wanted to do what US is doing in Afghanistan and Iraq we would not have had any choice...because they were victorious but they kept their word.<br />-- this is a funny argument, ever seen pictures of england after the nazis gave them a run down ? right, they were like afganistant two years from now :-) and Gandhi was a thorn in their flesh - do they have a choice ? India became more of a problem than as a party at that time. Never fight two wars at the same time, simple policy. British had no choice. They needed India however had no other choice. Infact Mr.Churchil thought it was stupid to release us... he wanted to 'milk' us and rebuild England.... </p>
<p>The first Indo pak war was won or atleast not lost thanks to two old fellow officers talking to each other to save a great war in a country already tiorn by a partition... It was the Pakistani Chief of Staff who phoned his indian counterpart both british ofcourse.<br />--- yeah right, the british had nothing to do with the partition or its after math.</p>
<p>The bottomline We were a great nation with Heritage university Script and knowledge when the west except Rome and Greece were in caves...<br />We let it slip in the middle thanks to false interpretation of our own values it was enhanced by foreign intervention but we were to blam not them.<br />-- True, but it is still slipping as we still keep thinking west as the savior. Unless we recognize the fact that our country and culture teaches us the true human values, we will not progress much anyway.</p>

        <p>Dear Ravi<br />I am afraid your arguement is hollow</p>
<p>Tamilnadu is just one example...you just have to turn into history books to see the sects and sections good example rajputs...marathas...</p>
<p>Who said people didnt fight against them <br />History books again Kalingas resisted Ashoka...Bloody War<br />Pulikesin resisted Harshavardana<br />Sivaji fought Aurangazeb.....</p>
<p>The only difference between Then and the British for 300 years the Indians were enslaved the free ones that is under the british and joined a man who cared for them....<br />the Maharajas were still bystnaders negotiating their future with the brits...OOOps the enemies</p>

<p>Pakistan vs India is something of a different ghost and again points to british (may be i can give them credit for a useful side effect).</p>
<p>What was india called before ... this is funny, it just shows that your argument is very very limited to tamil nadu, i dont blame it but then thats what the english achieved. There was a country called 'BHARAT' or as we say ' Bharatam'. Does the name Bharatham make any sense ?</p>
<p>Read thirupugazh (1400 AD) and you will know how much of sanskrit and other bharat languages are mixed in that... mixing up dark ages with the light of a train coming out of a dark tunnel is not in the best interests of bharat.</p>

<p>Hi ravi<br />you and i could go on and on without convincing each other and <br />boring others to the bottoms of their limits.</p>
<p>but just tell me <br />what was the status of the entity called india in 1950, 1900, 1850, <br />1800, 1750, 1700, before that<br />if we honestly refer history we would know there existed no such <br />entity.</p>
<p>today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we <br />should hate them.<br />the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi <br />driver in ajman UAE.</p>
<p>borders change, and so does history with it.<br />european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic <br />tracts as single entities .<br />indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir, <br />or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting <br />incompatible people.<br />in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese <br />and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the case <br />against them.</p>

India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals ruled <br />for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250. <br />Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many <br />states, so what ? US is 50+ states, china was so many states the <br />biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of <br />the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma.

<p>  Hi Venu<br />  I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />  thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid their <br />  taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.</p>
<p>  most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs who <br />  saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh <br />war. <br />  the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />  what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful <br />  nation called india in say 1600.<br />  if you were born in 1600 ( or as you say 1970 if the british had <br />not <br />  come at all) you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of <br />  pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of <br />ramnad <br />  or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of <br />  madurai.<br />  that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />  you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great <br />show <br />  of unity united on their own in the national interest and then <br />opened <br />  negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of <br />  hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of tranvancore, <br />  the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin. <br />  this would have united south india.<br />  then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern <br />hindu <br />  muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings( ar you will be <br />  calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon) to <br />  unite one democratic nation called india.<br />  you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />  even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the <br />sardar <br />  to join the indian confedration.<br />  the maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and <br />  you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and pelf <br />so <br />  that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />  its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.</p>
<p>  have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited <br />  in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been <br />  discussing.</p>
<p>  to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />  trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>  patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should <br />not <br />  be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>  what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or <br />the <br />  slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un <br />united <br />  india.<br />  regards<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric <br />  tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a <br />  shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... <br />pathetic <br />  and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how <br />  people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence <br />India <br />  is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is <br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<p>    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability, <br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly <br />  set afire by the British. </p>
<p>    Sati: <br />    1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core <br />of <br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British never <br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have <br />  added more points below.)<br />    2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at <br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. <br />honestly <br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life <br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where <br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, <br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted <br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have <br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />  1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of <br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />  hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do <br />  with western explorers landing in India...)<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It ties <br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now <br />  where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<p>    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a <br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the <br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not <br />open. <br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />  1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new <br />  definition as caste politics now.</p>
<p>    Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan <br />kaamanai <br />  vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during <br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of <br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' <br />was <br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think <br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, <br />dating <br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model <br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex <br />is <br />  taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our <br />great <br />  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they <br />were <br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare <br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out <br />dated <br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) to <br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer <br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where <br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. <br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the <br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />  'talent'. </p>
<p>    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the <br />  African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious <br />comment <br />  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare <br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one <br />serious <br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations <br />in <br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country. </p>
<p>    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did, <br />  by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy <br />  trains vs the TUBE in london).<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant <br />management <br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like <br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have <br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the <br />british <br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as 'Oh Almighty British <br />- <br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat'.</p>
<p>    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on <br />india <br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read <br />  Kalki's<br />    comments on Churchill's thoughts on India. Make no mistake, <br />Britain <br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they <br />were <br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. </p>
<p>    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are <br />worthless <br />  and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India <br />  does<br />    not exist without the west. </p>
<p>    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain <br />is <br />  Europe's crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation <br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is <br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them <br />making <br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather <br />than <br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<p>    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more <br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor <br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.</p>
<p>    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real <br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british <br />able <br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were <br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have <br />an <br />  idea now. </p>

<p>    Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>    I would definitely be against all your points. What you <br />described, <br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the <br />  characteristics of india.</p>
<p>    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing <br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill <br />  of ourself.</p>
<p>    Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>    1) The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the <br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request <br />you <br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to <br />a <br />  women committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>    2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We <br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the <br />dress <br />  style is entirely different..</p>
<p>    3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower <br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the <br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<p>    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those <br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in <br />india, <br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation. </p>
<p>    4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />  ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools <br />in <br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />  today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />  all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>    You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /<br />3beautiful- <br />  tree.zip </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>    5) Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the <br />  western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th <br />  century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>    6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the <br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the <br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as <br />  sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. <br />the <br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism <br />effect.)</p>
<p>    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the <br />bharatanatyam, <br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like <br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam <br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded <br />to <br />  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<p>    7. Slavery:<br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of <br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>    8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>    Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close <br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the <br />  girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The <br />  girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her <br />  childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<p>    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />  days.</p>
<p>    "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in <br />the <br />  west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why <br />  it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>    9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, <br />and <br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every <br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested <br />with <br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />  vellalars.</p>
<p>    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be <br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of <br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few <br />  castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed <br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>    10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our <br />  mother tongues..</p>
<p>    11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the <br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its <br />sacrificed <br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. </p>
<p>    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated <br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own <br />  community (not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, <br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>    Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like <br />that, <br />  let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who <br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa <br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, <br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<p>    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br />    <http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one <br />  is barbaric. </p>
<p>    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really <br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of <br />our <br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going <br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a <br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, <br />  still india is our only land for us)</p>

<p>      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />      those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />      society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />      today, when compared with contemporary nations:</p>
<p>      1) The Sati system<br />      2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />      garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />      3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />      4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />      5) Fate of widows<br />      6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />      devadasi system<br />      7) Slavery<br />      8) Marriage at childhood<br />      9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />      10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />      11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>      But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />      main crux to be focussed. </p>
<p>      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

        <p>:-) Agreed to that point. <br />And it is true that I will never accept the supremacy of the crown.</p>
<p>Pakistan vs India is something of a different ghost and again points to british (may be i can give them credit for a useful side effect).</p>
<p>What was india called before ... this is funny, it just shows that your argument is very very limited to tamil nadu, i dont blame it but then thats what the english achieved. There was a country called 'BHARAT' or as we say ' Bharatam'. Does the name Bharatham make any sense ?</p>
<p>Read thirupugazh (1400 AD) and you will know how much of sanskrit and other bharat languages are mixed in that... mixing up dark ages with the light of a train coming out of a dark tunnel is not in the best interests of bharat.</p>

<p>Hi ravi<br />you and i could go on and on without convincing each other and <br />boring others to the bottoms of their limits.</p>
<p>but just tell me <br />what was the status of the entity called india in 1950, 1900, 1850, <br />1800, 1750, 1700, before that<br />if we honestly refer history we would know there existed no such <br />entity.</p>
<p>today we are patriotically told pakistanis are our enemies and we <br />should hate them.<br />the only pakistani i have ever spoken to was a damn friendly taxi <br />driver in ajman UAE.</p>
<p>borders change, and so does history with it.<br />european invaders were responsible for uniting large geographic <br />tracts as single entities .<br />indonesia, malysia, india, african states.<br />while we in india refuse to give them the credit people in kashmir, <br />or sri lanka blame european colonialists for wrongly uniting <br />incompatible people.<br />in one of the earlier mails you had said british divided sinhalese <br />and the tamils. actually they wrongly united them should be the case <br />against them.</p>

India had peace under many of its rulers. Mugals ruled <br />for 300 - 400 years approximately. Cholas were from 850 to 1250. <br />Ashoka the great united India under one roof. Yes we were many <br />states, so what ? US is 50+ states, china was so many states the <br />biggest difference in India was that from the length and breadth of <br />the country, we all used to believe in Hindu dharma. Sanskrit was <br />spoken widely before the british split us, tamil was in tamil <br />heartland, we used to speak many languages in indian country. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Ghori / Ghazni plundered the country, we bounced back, mughals <br />tried to break the hindu culture and failed miserably, Nadir shah </p></blockquote>
<p>ripped us we rebound back.... then came the british, fresh out of <br />their dark age, exploring new territories looking for places were <br />they can spread their culture, education (as if no one else was <br />educated), systematically ripped us of our minds and caused people <br />such as yourself who believe in their dominion after 60 years. Whilst <br />you speak of us going the African way, why wont you think of us going <br />the Chinese way ? There lies a mind set, again british preset.</p>
<blockquote><p>  India, an internal economy, there in was her strength, the british <br />wanted to develop their country and started levying heavy taxes on </p></blockquote>
<p>Indian goods and exported european goods. Coincided with the <br />industrial revolution in england...fact or fiction ? Read the <br />Imperial Gazzetter of 1881:</p>

This is only in </p></blockquote>
<p>textile, go for many many other imports and exports you will see that <br />a billion of dollar value would be transfered every damn year for 100 <br />years of british rule, and here we have patrons to be so happy with <br />their rule.</p>

<p>built its steel plant and rose against the empire, luckily for Tata, <br />they happened to find customers in british during WW II. Gandhi and <br />Tata worked closely in removing the steel trade of british from <br />India. Check the public documents of Birmingham and Sheffield. </p>
<blockquote><p>  Next - salt, monopoly of salt trade, british hit us with that and <br />that was when our power as a nation moved full surge ahead. <br />  You can be proud that we helped england rebuild itself with our <br />money. <br />  And coming to think of the tribal chieftains, they are still <br />available today... they just kept changing names.. from sitrarasan of </p></blockquote>
<p>chola period to chieftains of mugal rules to zamindars of british <br />rule to MLA's of republic of India. We are still at war with our <br />neighbors, for water for trade for space for land etc... We will <br />always be at war, it is our family, we will come to a compromise <br />today or tomorrow. your motive says that just because karnataka wont <br />release water, get whites to rule us.... how cool! </p>

<p>is for sure, it is immaterial if Maculay really said his famous quote <br />in 1835, what is alleged definitely is happening today. They have <br />successfully planted their domain in minds of many indians. It is <br />another test for the great nation and I am sure she will come good as <br />usual.</p>

<p>  Hi Venu<br />  I am so glad you anscestors did not co operate with the british.<br />  thats outright patriotism.I am sure they would not have paid their <br />  taxes to british, ttended their schools or used their facilities.</p>
<p>  most communities in india did co operate for example the sikhs who <br />  saw the british as liberators even after losing the anglos sikh <br />war. <br />  the gurkhs too joined the british armies after losing a war.<br />  what was the geographical or political status of this wonderful <br />  nation called india in say 1600.<br />  if you were born in 1600 ( or as you say 1970 if the british had <br />not <br />  come at all) you would have ben born in the thondaiman kingdom of <br />  pudukottai, serfoji kingdom of tanjore or maravar kingdoms of <br />ramnad <br />  or sivaganga or the nawabs kingdom of arcot or naik kingdom of <br />  madurai.<br />  that was the geographical condition when the british entered.<br />  you have a lot of imagination to say all these states in a great <br />show <br />  of unity united on their own in the national interest and then <br />opened <br />  negotiations with the telugu kingdoms and the muslim nizam of <br />  hydrabad and wodeyars of mysore and padmanabadasas of tranvancore, <br />  the zamorins of calicut and kings of cochin. <br />  this would have united south india.<br />  then they would have opened negotiations with the 1000 northern <br />hindu <br />  muslim sikh kingdoms, convinced their despot kings( ar you will be <br />  calling them noble men who descended from the sun and the moon) to <br />  unite one democratic nation called india.<br />  you beat most of the fiction writers today to propose this.<br />  even in 1947 land locked kingdoms had to be arm twisted by the <br />sardar <br />  to join the indian confedration.<br />  the maharajas were the most decandent selfish mosquitoes we had and <br />  you hope they would have voluntarily given up their power and pelf <br />so <br />  that you or I could have a democratic country.<br />  its just not reasonable even to entertain this thought.</p>
<p>  have you heard of thuggery, human sacrifice,. these things exisited <br />  in this part of the world along with the social evils we have been <br />  discussing.</p>
<p>  to turn a blind eye to the social evils that existed is bad but <br />  trying to justify them as right is ridiculous.</p>
<p>  patriotism is a feeling that a country should improve. it should <br />not <br />  be misconstrued as " nothing about my country can be wrong"</p>
<p>  what happened in nandigram is as bad as the civilwar in sudan or <br />the <br />  slaughter in congo. it would have been a daily event in an un <br />united <br />  india.<br />  regards<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    Degrading our country and making it sound like we were a barbaric <br />  tribe begging for a deliverer in the british empire, which is in a <br />  shade worse than even commenting on our freedom fighters.... <br />pathetic <br />  and a horrendous shame, honestly I am searching for words on how <br />  people can degrade the nation. Frustration on post independence <br />India <br />  is not to be diverted as 'oh the british were better', that is <br />  childish and namesake pathetic argument.</p>
<p>    Blowing out of proportion in things such as Sati, untouchability, <br />  child mairrage, caste system etc were created by mugals and clearly <br />  set afire by the British. </p>
<p>    Sati: <br />    1. A certain 'indian' by name Raja Ram Mohan Roy made it a core <br />of <br />  issue causing the British to forcibly pass the law. (British never <br />  allow any controversy to brew,excellent management strategy, i have <br />  added more points below.)<br />    2.Talk about a widow's life without her husband was not easy at <br />  that time. This is clearly in tie up with widow re-mairrage. <br />honestly <br />  how many widows get remarried today ? What happens in a widows life <br />  is not debatable, I think all rational people know what kind of <br />  treatment she gets even today.<br />    We had been a warring community according to some,by logic, where <br />  there is war, there are dead people, when there are dead people, <br />  there are widows, i dont remember reading any big mass burn outs <br />  during chola empire or even when early mugals ruled.<br />    The Sati was not a practice by law or rule or force, it was opted <br />  by wives who chose NOT to live without their partners who they have <br />  lived with since they were children. It became a rule after the <br />  1800's which is what Raja Ram opposed. Which is again out of <br />  compulsion, to give away life is a strict no-no according to the <br />  hindu dharma. (hmmm why am I thinking that this has something to do <br />  with western explorers landing in India...)<br />    Ever reasoned why our elders say 'sumangaliya poyidanum'. It ties <br />  up with child mairrage also, they used live as ONE and not like now <br />  where we need 'our own space'.</p>
<p>    Untouchability: Oh please give me a break, untouchability is a <br />  concept that takes a lot of mind and bravery to convert after the <br />  middle ages... this is existant even today, just that it is not <br />open. <br />  Untouchability was defined in other terms too as Race and Darkies <br />  etc... the british supporters practically put a new cover for old <br />  book. If you read the proper context of vedas, you will know that <br />  untouchability was not from ages ago and it was practically for a <br />  1000 years now. It is not called untouchability now, it has a new <br />  definition as caste politics now.</p>
<p>    Child mairrage: The term 'kanavanin thunaiyai kondu thaan <br />kaamanai <br />  vella vendum' has a lot of meaning to this specific concept, during <br />  the mid ages, the teen hormone transit was diverted into a model of <br />  Child mairrage, the couple was to be friends during teen age when <br />  their sexual hormones in body was raging up, the 'sexual outlet' <br />was <br />  to be controlled instead of falling to false morals. I know that <br />  reading with a non rational mind it will be even difficult to think <br />  what I mentioned here. In western culture there was free sex, <br />dating <br />  was simple and a model for that. Indian culture sex is for <br />  reproduction and considered a Godly. A combination of western model <br />  and conservative indian thoughts brought about a process where sex <br />is <br />  taboo. We know what many teens of our era are doing vs what our <br />great <br />  grand parents were. Most of our ancestors had married when they <br />were <br />  children. One in a 100 complained, that is bound to happen. Compare <br />  the success of child<br />    mairrage vs divorce ratio's. Agreed child mairrage is an out <br />dated <br />  concept, we are neither naive nor innocent (thanks to the west) to <br />  follow that tradition, we have moved out of it, that was an answer <br />  our ancestors had for adolescence. We are not in early ages, where <br />  girls matured at 16 and boys were following Rama's model of life. <br />  Today hormones are different and ...porn is the largest seller on <br />  internet. So instead of child mairrage, the 'sexual outlet' or the <br />  energy that drives us to what we are needs to be channelized into <br />  'talent'. </p>
<p>    A few more to add on the comment that India would have gone the <br />  African way. I would first need to know if that is a serious <br />comment <br />  or a desperate stab in the dark. Only ignorant people who do not <br />  understand the basics of India can really try very hard and compare <br />  India with Africa. In my ignorant best I am not aware of one <br />serious <br />  literacy that africa produced. Comparing India to warring nations <br />in <br />  Africa is more or less degrading my country. </p>
<p>    A rational mind is needed to look at what the British really did, <br />  by looking at bridges and railways (oh great again we have lousy <br />  trains vs the TUBE in london).<br />    There were a few rational people and a lot of brilliant <br />management <br />  people in the British, ofcourse there are sane<br />    people everywhere.. .even in Africa. By remanding a bastard like <br />  dyre or jackson the<br />    british thought they can impress some indians who were hardcore<br />    supporters of the crown. An unattended jalianwallahbad would have <br />  even<br />    caused the coldest and darkest of indian hearts aiding the <br />british <br />  to rethink a motive. That<br />    is management strategy not to be confused as 'Oh Almighty British <br />- <br />  I see your Grace in the bread we eat'.</p>
<p>    Churchill the prime minister of england was a great man - english<br />    patriot / freedom fighter and a strategist, but churchill on <br />india <br />  was<br />    definitely not the man on mark. I would be interested to read <br />  Kalki's<br />    comments on Churchill's thoughts on India. Make no mistake, <br />Britain <br />  is a great country for the British, but to even think that they <br />were <br />  the rulers for our country is nothing short of traitor note. </p>
<p>    Post Independence, we have our own people thinking we are <br />worthless <br />  and sing<br />    hosanas of the western empire and believe strongly that the India <br />  does<br />    not exist without the west. </p>
<p>    Yes as in any nation, there will be atrocities, Nandhigram here is<br />    equivalent to Columbine in US or other issues anywhere. Britain <br />is <br />  Europe's crime<br />    hotspots according the the Guardian in Feb 2007. How the nation <br />  recoups is key and we can be a critic or rebuild it stronger. It is <br />  like making mistakes, you do not disown your children for them <br />making <br />  mistakes. A country makes mistakes, we need to correct it rather <br />than <br />  adopting a gutter mongering pig to rule us.</p>
<p>    A nation that does not believe in itself will only cause more <br />worry.<br />    What we are today is a trend of the british and our traitor <br />citizens<br />    who helped the british then, only that we are all indians.</p>
<p>    I guess I am one of the guys who feels we can learn from the real <br />  Indian history and not that what the thieving morons left behind.</p>
<p>    On hind sight: I have always wondered... how were the british <br />able <br />  to rule a great nation as India, it was believed that there were <br />  Indians who for petty measures helped the British. I think I have <br />an <br />  idea now. </p>

<p>    Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>    I would definitely be against all your points. What you <br />described, <br />  may have happened in few places. But they were definitely NOT the <br />  characteristics of india.</p>
<p>    I feel, the major success of the britishers were not in capturing <br />  our territory. But making persons like Venkateswaran, to speak ill <br />  of ourself.</p>
<p>    Ok. let me counter your points.</p>
<p>    1) The Sati system<br />    The sati system were entirely mis-represented in our history. <br />  Actually, this is a voluntary ritual, willingly accepted by the <br />women.<br />    Secondly, it did not happen in all places. But only in certain <br />  areas of North india, like Rajasthan, Bihar etc. I would request <br />you <br />  to read a first hand account of an european traveller, who spoke to <br />a <br />  women committing sati. (page#8 in the following link)</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /vol1.pdf </p>
<p>    2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper garments</p>
<p>    I agree that this happened. But, we dont know from when onwards <br />  this started. And it happened only in a few places, like kerala. We <br />  should also consider, that on those days, prior to british, the <br />dress <br />  style is entirely different..</p>
<p>    3. Untouchability:</p>
<p>    This is a bad one.. but again its one of mis-represented facts. <br />  Untouchability is not a thing done by higher caste against lower <br />  caste. Rather, its practiced by all castes equally. Even today, the <br />  SC castes do not drink water in other SC caste's family.</p>
<p>    Again, although this is a drawback, its far far better than those <br />  semitic religions, which had masterminded, mass murder, and in <br />india, <br />  the Goa Inquisition. Untouchability is far far better than the <br />  semitic concept "Only my god is true and all others are satan".</p>
<p>    The concept of upper caste and lower caste were british creation. </p>
<p>    4. Education &amp; Employment:</p>
<p>    Again, you are grossly misrepresenting india out of your <br />  ignorance. As per dharampal's finding, there were 1 laksh schools <br />in <br />  Bengal province. Almost all villages had schools, and most of <br />  today's BC/MBC &amp; some SC castes received education.<br />    The same case in Madras presidency. There were 1 lakh schols in <br />  all over madras presidency.</p>
<p>    You can find more details in the following book of dharampal.</p>
<p>    <http://www.samanvay a.com/dharampal/ frames/downloads /<br />3beautiful- <br />  tree.zip </http://www.samanvay></p>
<p>    5) Fate of widows<br />    You need to explain this. Widow remarriage is not allowed.. But <br />  they had their means of support and survival.. Unlike, in the <br />  western nations, where women is an use &amp; throw entity till 19th <br />  century, we had adequate representation &amp; protection of women .</p>
<p>    6. Devadasi:</p>
<p>    Again, this is a mis-represented factor. The devadasi system <br />  were meant for a noble cause, and before muslim invasion, the <br />  devadaasis enjoyed high status. Please refer the following link.<br />    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Devadasi</p>
<p>    The system degraded further, after the british conquest, with the <br />  highly narrow views of semitic faiths of sex outside marriage as <br />  sin. (whereas in hinduism, sex is recognized spiritually, and <br />  devadasis, while enjoying high status, also had the privilege of <br />  choosing her partner. Because, in hinduism, sex is part of life. <br />the <br />  concept of brahmacharya and celebacy came only after buddhism <br />effect.)</p>
<p>    See.. the various arts and dances, particularly the <br />bharatanatyam, <br />  were pioneered by devadaasis,. . Many of the popular artists, like <br />  lata mangeskar, trace their legacy to devadasi system.<br />    Its really a self degrading statement, to classify them as <br />  prostitutes. . Noble and sophisticated dances like Bharatnatyam <br />  cannot originate from a prostitutes. . The devadasis are degraded <br />to <br />  prostitution, because of loss of their patronage, during British <br />  rule, as they took over all sources of wealth.</p>
<p>    7. Slavery:<br />    Needless to say, slavery doesnt existed in india at any point of <br />  time.. probably, a lot of slaves were taken by the muslim invaders.</p>
<p>    8. Child Marriage:</p>
<p>    Its really researchable, what's wrong in child marriage. Its a <br />  usual practice that most of the marriages happen among close <br />  relatives till few decades back.. and its a common belief, that the <br />  girl child should reach her husband's house, before puberty. The <br />  girl child grows as part of her husband's family, right from her <br />  childhood and get adapted to it.</p>
<p>    Child marriage is irrelevant in modern times, but NOT in those <br />  days.</p>
<p>    "When comparing to the sexual abuse of girl child happening in <br />the <br />  west even today, child marriage is far far better"</p>
<p>    If you are countering, please reply with factual analysis, on why <br />  it is considered as evil.</p>
<p>    9. Priestly Class</p>
<p>    Priestly class requires lot of self discipline, and dedication, <br />and <br />  spiritual knowledge to perform pujas and rituals. Since every <br />  profession is associated with castes, the priestly duties rested <br />with <br />  brahmins, just like trading with chettiyars, agricultural with <br />  vellalars.</p>
<p>    also, contrary to the propogation, no other castes claimed to be <br />  priest.. infact, on those days, every caste, inspite of <br />  untouchability, gave basic recognition to other castes duties.</p>
<p>    So, the very basic intention is malicious to say, that only few <br />  castes are allowed.. its not like that.. the people who performed <br />  priestly hood is few, and its the same in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>    10. Suppression of mother tongues:</p>
<p>    This is utter nonsense.. Infact, the british suppressed all our <br />  mother tongues..</p>
<p>    11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>    Yes.. this happen even today.. But, the core concept is that the <br />  animal to be killed should reach god, and that's why, its <br />sacrificed <br />  in temples. God is both the saviour and destroyer.. </p>
<p>    Ok.. why dont we feel it as barbaric, the fully automated <br />  slaughtering house, killing thousands of bulls per day..<br />    Is it that, if a few animal sacrificed in temple of their own <br />  community (not to our god..) according to tradition is barbarious, <br />  and killing thousands in a slaughter house is NOT..</p>
<p>    Arent we contradiction at our own statements.</p>
<p>    Let those people follow their own tradition. if we dont like <br />that, <br />  let's stay away from them, rather than ridiculing them.</p>
<p>    we need to understand our culture before we start degrading it.</p>
<p>    I dont know how you brand european thinking as modern, who <br />  committed numerous atrocities on the world population. The Goa <br />  Inquisition is one of the worst act of cruelty and barbarism, <br />  committed by the europeans. Refer the below links.</p>
<p>    <a href="http://en.wikipedia" title="http://en.wikipedia">http://en.wikipedia</a> .org/wiki/ Goa_Inquisition<br />    <http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Inquisition </p>
<p>    Now its very imperative to know which one is modern and which one <br />  is barbaric. </p>
<p>    No one abandons his mother, even if she is rude.. But, its really <br />  a continuation of slave mentality to still trash at every form of <br />our <br />  culture.. It doesnt reflect a confident indian.. what are we going <br />  to achieve by this negationist attitude? Are we going to get a <br />  paradise in the western nation? Inspite of all these opposition, <br />  still india is our only land for us)</p>

<p>      The new ideas and the "questioning attitude" that came<br />      about in the Europe during the renaissance period<br />      really spread to India through the Britishers. Without<br />      those modern thinking, some of the elements of our<br />      society would have turned our state truly "barbaric"<br />      today, when compared with contemporary nations:</p>
<p>      1) The Sati system<br />      2) Women of many caste were not allowed to wear upper<br />      garments - no hooks, buttons were sold to them.<br />      3) Untouchability &amp; bad treatment of lower caste.<br />      4) Education and employment only for elite classes.<br />      5) Fate of widows<br />      6) Marriage of girls to gods ( pottu kattutal ) &amp; the<br />      devadasi system<br />      7) Slavery<br />      8) Marriage at childhood<br />      9) Only few castes can be of priestly class<br />      10) Suppression of mother tongues.<br />      11) Sacrifice of animals in rituals.</p>
<p>      But how are we spending our freedom today? Thats the<br />      main crux to be focussed. </p>
<p>      The real freedom of India can be fought only by<br />      children today. The nation will change, only if they<br />      pursuade their parents to follow the path of the<br />      truth. Only the children can do - no law, no<br />      enforcement can make about this change. The children<br />      should walk away from parents that take bribe or do<br />      illegal things and seek shelter in an orphanage. If<br />      they do this, the whole nation will change in a week!</p>

        <p>Sporadic incidents cannot be termed in general. You are confusing democracy and imperialism. <br />You cannot do these in democracy but monarchs can. You are only talking of TN where there were so many states in the country. <br />British unification was an accident, managerial strategies. </p>
<p>Ashoka had bloody wars so did <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  so did Harsha true, it is not like the british were patrons of ahimsa. If at all any credit to be given to the crown, yea there is one, they were better than aurangazeb in one segment of their rule. </p>
<p>However, you have not responded on my question, why the indians never united to fight against the mugals or ashoka or harsha but against the british? </p>

<p>Never<br />I am an indian who is proud of his heritage, ashamed of the ills of <br />the country with an unvarnished view of history where I want to give <br />credit to those who deserve it. <br />And I certainly dont need lessons in patriotism.</p>
<p>we have achieved a lot yes but was that possible being a subhject of <br />maharaja ofpudukottai or the zamindar of banganapalle.</p>
<p>the maharajah of pudukottai marthanda pairava thondaiman married and <br />australian and was chucked out by the british who wanted a blue <br />blooded indian royal to inherit his gaddi.<br />as a compensation marthana a top horse owner in australia demanded <br />and got 20 lakh rupees which was one years tazation income in <br />pudukottai. that year incidentaly 10, 000 of his subjects died due to <br />starvation and disease in a drought.</p>
<p>the lives and leisures of the maharajahs would have made india a <br />bankrupt nation.<br />its not singing the english lullaby to give cresit to the british for <br />chucking out these blod thirsty mosquitoes.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  but then i wasnt really insulted by ravi's mention of my zamindari <br />  back ground.<br />  my anscestors did so much for hindu religion and tamil culture and <br />  music that any mention of their political leanings would have no <br />  substance at all.<br />  if your anscestor was a zamindar, or a clerk in the british <br />  government it mattered the same. you had accepted their supremacy.<br />  the same went on for studying in british started schools, paying <br />the <br />  taxes. the fact is greater part of the nation had accepted british <br />  rule gladly because they knew what was happening in the <br />neighbouring <br />  princely state.it was a terrible state of affairs.<br />  even in a small state like pudukottai the british had to <br />occasionally <br />  enter the palace to chase out the hundreds of nautch girls in the <br />  palace and send the king to a sanatorium.<br />  why do we have contreversies that the national anthem jana gana <br />mana <br />  was really sung for the british emperor<br />  why was it that the freedom movement was greatly planned by UK <br />  returned leaders.</p>

<p>    Dear All<br />    I thing we are getting too emotional and personal here I think <br />Ravi <br />  owes an apology to venkat for bring his ancestors into this...<br />    Can we have a discusiion from the Head and not from the Heart <br />  blinded by fictious facts.</p>
<p>    I am not swayed one way or the other</p>
<p>    I am a proud of my country and its ancient heritage at the same <br />  time I am not blind to the facts</p>
<p>    Fact: look around the world of places colonised by the powers and <br />  whats left behind?</p>
<p>    Persions, Afghans and Mughals ...you dont see much of the ancient <br />  hindu heritage in north India...</p>
<p>    Spanish...The natives were completely wiped out of north and <br />southa <br />  merica<br />    French ....left the far east in such a state after looting them <br />  they are still in the dogs Like wise the French colonies of Africa<br />    Germany ....I think we all know our history....Well some believe <br />  hitler did it for the better ment of Aryan race...even in india<br />    America....</p>
<p>    I dont deny the fact that the British benefited from Indian <br />wealth <br />  initially it was the EIC then it was a bit moderated with the <br />  Crown....RRC did that 1000 years ago</p>
<p>    They did not have to reform certain civil inequalities...well <br />Sati, <br />  Child marraige and women's right werent social evil in some <br />opinions <br />  Ill reserve my opinion on that...They shouldnt have cared to change <br />  those they were hear only for the money....</p>
<p>    OOPs they did that to show how Hindu were barbarians and to <br />convert <br />  to Christianity ....Yes like the spaniards converted the whole of <br />goa <br />  into catholics...</p>
<p>    Satish <br />    Aparthied and the KKK are good examples and thats because they <br />dont <br />  considered coloured as humans at all...If we are proud to consider <br />a <br />  fellow indian as not human so we go and clean ourselves...We have <br />to <br />  be proud of ourselves...cant argue with that...<br />    I dont deny that exists even today...but still people speak out <br />and <br />  are outraged I am sure we all know of stephen lawrence case which <br />is <br />  still supported by locals...</p>
<p>    Come on I and vijay can choose the British PM just because i <br />lived <br />  in a counytry once ruled by the crown Yes a valid resident of <br />  commonwealth has voting rights in England</p>
<p>    We may all be talking Persian,Tamil, Sanskrit or whatever...Even <br />  today I get asked ''Aap Bharat mein hain Hindi kya bolnahi <br />  sakthi??'' Oh by the way matey My language is older than yours and <br />  yours is only spoken purely by four states maybe more with the <br />  dissections...</p>
<p>    We talked about our Half naked savior he was Ivy league type till <br />  he was brought to harsh reality in the middle of the night in a <br />train <br />  in south africa....He chose to change many dont....<br />    Do you know the support he had from the average white man in <br />  England because he was changing humanity and people recognised it <br />    You can call Tata a saviour but he was a business man</p>
<p>    You can blame the British for the Caste system, the hindu moslem <br />  issues but then if you werent fighting where was the place for the <br />  third man...If ChandaSahib and Mohamed ali didnot go to the French <br />  and English history might be different</p>
<p>    I would recomend you all to read a chapter in Freedom at Midnight <br />  not on Mahatmas exploits but our native maharajas ....Two of them <br />had <br />  a bet on how many girls they could deflower in a month (the custom <br />is <br />  virgins wear a mookuthi and removed it if they were no longer <br />  so...)one of them was able to make a crown out of it....</p>
<p>    Well that takes you back to 15th 16th century britain when the <br />  nobels had the right of PrimaNocte...spending the first night with <br />  all their subjects was their right.</p>
<p>    Gandhi was astute he ammassed people but it was our own Indians <br />who <br />  were against our own blood as officers and sepoys who beat all <br />those <br />  ahimsa wadis...thats where we went wrong!!!</p>
<p>    Gandhi fought for the british during the war...He gained what he <br />  needed after the war...If britain wanted to do what US is doing in <br />  Afghanistan and Iraq we would not have had any choice...because <br />they <br />  were victorious but they kept their word.</p>
<p>    The notion of Pakistan a hindu state was by a muslim student in <br />  Cambridge which even Jinnah felt was not possible...It happened</p>
<p>    The first Indo pak war was won or atleast not lost thanks to two <br />  old fellow officers talking to each other to save a great war in a <br />  country already tiorn by a partition...It was the Pakistani Chief <br />of <br />  Staff who phoned his indian counterpart both british ofcourse.</p>
<p>    The list is endless.....</p>
<p>    The bottomline We were a great nation with Heritage university <br />  Script and knowledge when the west except Rome and Greece were in <br />  caves...</p>
<p>    We let it slip in the middle thanks to false interpretation of <br />our <br />  own values it was enhanced by foreign intervention but we were to <br />  blam not them</p>
<p>    If we accept that with humility we will progress...</p>
<p>    Thanks</p>
<p>    Regards</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Sri<br />thanks a lot .</p>
<p>but then i wasnt really insulted by ravi's mention of my zamindari <br />back ground.<br />my anscestors did so much for hindu religion and tamil culture and <br />music that any mention of their political leanings would have no <br />substance at all.<br />if your anscestor was a zamindar, or a clerk in the british <br />government it mattered the same. you had accepted their supremacy.<br />the same went on for studying in british started schools, paying the <br />taxes. the fact is greater part of the nation had accepted british <br />rule gladly because they knew what was happening in the neighbouring <br />princely state.it was a terrible state of affairs.<br />even in a small state like pudukottai the british had to occasionally <br />enter the palace to chase out the hundreds of nautch girls in the <br />palace and send the king to a sanatorium.<br />why do we have contreversies that the national anthem jana gana mana <br />was really sung for the british emperor<br />why was it that the freedom movement was greatly planned by UK <br />returned leaders.</p>
<p>and its news to me that aurangazeb was greatly tolerated by the <br />people of india by any other emotion other than fear.</p>

          British India vs Post Independence India        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>You can't analyze history with counting your<br />patriotism.</p>
<p>In history emperors/kings plundered countries, killed<br />people. Asoka the great was no different from Hitler.</p>
<p>Rajaraja cholan was no different from Alexander the<br />great.</p>
<p>British were no different from Post Independence<br />Indian governments.</p>
<p>At the end of the day achievement matters.</p>
<p>India might have been Indonesia if British not arrived<br />at that time. Mugal emperor was still in power at that<br />time regardless of his puppet stature and meaning less<br />to talk about something never happened that north<br />kings might have allied and ousted Mugals because the<br />very same north kings betrayed Prithviraj and arranged<br />their self defeat.</p>
<p>This is something a football team with a leading goal<br />has more possibilities to win the match than opponent<br />team with out any goal. If opponent team make their<br />same side goal would be bonuses for the goal leading<br />team and fun for everyone!</p>
<p>Team 1:</p>
<p>Pre British-mogul era Indian kings they already done<br />same side goal betraying Prithviraj and assured their<br />early defeat. The same kings become puppet later!<br />A self defeated team!</p>
<p>Team 2:</p>
<p>British prevented India becoming Indonesia, united and<br />built India. A winning team!</p>
<p>Team 3:</p>
<p>Post Indian governments betrayed our own people and<br />their achievements is poor.</p>
<p>A self defeated team!</p>
<p>Simple football analysis!</p>

<blockquote><p>  So saying that ony Brits united us as a single country is just an <br />  incident in Indian history. If not for brits, someone else would <br />  have done it, its the compulsion of time. But at the same time, I <br />  really appreciate Brits for doing this.</p></blockquote>
<p>.... as one unified entity. with one single conciousness as an indian <br />and not a tamilian or a kannadiga.<br />it never happenned before and ashoka's unity was more bloody and <br />would have been thro sub kings.</p>
<p>okay you talk about the great indian unity which was inherent.<br />if tomorrow somebody in power announces any state can seccede from <br />the indian union, how many will stay back?</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<blockquote><p>  If something has to happen, it will...maybe through someone. As a <br />  good human, I should thank that person whole heartedly, but should <br />  not belive that, if not for that person, my life would have come to <br />  a standstill. if not that person some xyz would have come my way. <br />  But at the same time, i should not take this arguement and be <br />  thankless to the person who helped. The same is my feelign towards <br />  brits.</p>
<p>  Comapring the rule of different rulers, everyone has their own pros <br />  and cons. Ofcourse the maharaja's period were the dark ages, <br />because <br />  India didnt get a great leader during those times. Saying british <br />  rule was better than muslim rule, is like saying one fire wood is <br />  better than the other. Everyone ruined us in their own ways. If you <br />  say, British gave us all the technology we have today, the muslims <br />  gave us all the architecture marvels we have today. Taj has brought <br />  India more pride than Indian Railways. So will you accept if I say <br />  that Mogul rule was better than British rule, because Moguls gave <br />an <br />  identity to India?</p>
<p>  VK arguement - we have a level playing field after the british <br />  period. Great joke. Can i contest an election and do good for this <br />  country today? You will yes, but its possible only in papers...as <br />  per law, yes I can. but practicality??? Can a qualified person get <br />  the required thing life, let it be education or job...are we <br />treated <br />  equally in India? NO. Who brought these caste discriminations? <br />  Sanathana dharma had only varna's which is profession based and <br />  never caste based. Its the brain child of the 'divide and rule' <br />  policy, which we suffer till date.</p>
<p>  Comparing congress and non congress party - Except for a five year <br />  BJP rule and 2 year JP rule, when was India ruled by Non congress <br />  party? comparing 7 years to 53 years is kidding.</p>
<p>  I am ready to accept any facts...will the govt. be bold enough to <br />  publicise it? Forget Gandhi's personal life, no one is going to <br />gain <br />  anything out of it. But how many facts which affect the common <br />  masses have been suppressed in India? Why dont you point those <br />  facts...who cares if Gandhi had an affair with a married women or <br />  Nehru had an affair with Mrs.MB. They were public figures who did a <br />  great deal to the nation.Period. If they prove to be unfit leaders, <br />  as an Individual its my liberty to change my mind. Nation is in no <br />  way getting affected by this. But surely the nation is affected by <br />  many a false propaganda which the brits sow seeds for.</p>
<p>  British rule is like this - Giving a hungry man a pot full of rice <br />  with a drop of poison mixed in it. They gave India whatever we have <br />  today, but with a poisioned minds all around. </p>

<p>    could you list the wrongs the british did for discussion purpose?</p>
<p>    and who would you rate as our best rulers.<br />    the moslems<br />    the maharajahs<br />    the british<br />    the congress party<br />    the non congress parties.</p>
<p>    Vk was saying india is a much level playing field for all people <br />    after the british came and left.<br />    evils are every where and india is able to sort out its problems</p>
<p>    a false shield of patrioism is being raised by many to hide <br />behind <br />    unanswerable problems.</p>
<p>    if somebody said mahatma gandhi had an affair with a married <br />woman <br />    after he took control of the freedom struggle and had 4 grown up <br />  sons <br />    would you term it un patriotic.</p>
<p>    what if his own grandson researches and finds it.</p>
<p>    thats the main subject of the book that was released a year back.<br />    arent patriotism and the unvarnished truth compatible????<br />    venketesh</p></abhivencat@></p></blockquote>
