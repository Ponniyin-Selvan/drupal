<p>It was the time of the Car Festival. The rituals began, with the king sweeping that part of the chariot where the deity was to be placed. This signified that even the king was a humble servant of the Lord. (The custom continues-the descendants of the former kings of Puri still performing the rite.) </p>
<p>But the Kanchi minister thought such sweeping was an act unworthy of a king. "We cannot make a sweeper-king our son-in-law!" he said to his master, whereupon the king of Kanchi withdrew his consent to the proposal. </p>
<p>The infuriated Purushottam Dev marched upon Kanchi, but was defeated. On returning to Puri, he prostrated himself before Sri Jagannath, praying for victory or death! The Lord assured him in a dream that he would win on a second expedition. </p>
<p>A further assurance of victory was provided soon. As he rode behind his army near Lake Chilika, a milkmaid signaled to him to stop. " A little before the army passed, two riders, one dark, the other fair, ate my curds and gave me this ring, assuring me that a rider would soon follow who would pay me my dues and recover the ring. They were in a hurry to reach Kanchi, to fight on behalf of our king!" she said. </p>
<p>The king recognised the diamond ring-it was the one he had recently offered to Jagannath. </p>
<p>He was sure that the riders were none other than Jagannath and Balabhadra! </p>
<p>The king won the battle, took princess Padmavati prisoner and returned to Puri. But that was not compensation enough for his earlier humiliation. He ordered his minister to give the princess in marriage to a sweeper! </p>
<p>The minister was a wise man. He let a few months pass. It was once more time for the Car Festival. </p>
<p>As the king climbed the chariot and stooped to sweep its platform, two tender hands put a garland round his neck. Behind the young girl stood the minister. </p>
<p>"My Lord," he said, "where could I find a more eligible sweeper to win the hand of princess Padmavati?" Thus the princess of Kanchi became the queen of Kalinga. </p>
<p>=====================================</p>
<p>Puri Rath Yatra - A Long Waiting Event to Celebrate</p>
<p>Since time immemorial, Puri the city on the eastern cost of India has been claiming as a major attraction for saints and servants of different faiths who usually visit for Salvation. Puri is known to the world over for its great temple of Lord Jagannath, which is one among the four holiest places of pilgrimate (Chaturdham) in India. Lord Jagnnath, the presiding deity and center of assimilation of various religious and faiths and believes has been worshipped by the savara tribals from 240 B.C. The cult of Jagannath which accepts the philosophical aspects of all religious and faith and which has survived and sustained throughout the course of history is the quistessence of Orissan life and culture. He is really the synthesis of the essence of Jainism, Buddhism, Tantricism and Vaishnavism, the ritualistic aspects of which are manifested in his daily worship. Hence all claim Jagannath to be their symbolical deity for all times to come.<br />Jagannath is neither a seculpture nor a painting worshipped n an uniconic form without hands, legs and other human features unlike the deities of Hind Pantheon. Many stories and legends around this God made him highly controversial and yet most acceptable and adorable. But the all accepted appropriate tale clarifies, king Indradyumna assigned the job to Viswakarma with a condition to dazzle the God by his own creation but Viswakarma requested the kind of be absolutely alone till the completion of work and orders accordingly accorded. Months passed and getting impatient, the king was forced by his beloved queen to open the doors. And since from that day the deities are found an incomplete shape. According to legend, tribal king Bniswabasu in the form of Nalamadhava was worshiping the Lord. But subsequently king Indradymna constructed a temple in the honour of lord. This temple was destroyed in course of time. After some centuries king Jajati created another temple and<br />worshipped the deities Balabhadra, Jagannath and Subhadra. The present gigantic temple that dominate the landscape for kilometers around were build only in the 12th century AD by king Chodaganga Dev.<br />Shun the mortal barriers of cast, creed and distinciton, Lord Jagannath the embodiment of universalism rightly claims to the Lord of Universe. He is not only a god enshrined in the highest alters of divinity but come down to the people and even takes the guise of soliders in order to help their devout king and to save the country which are fabricated in the legend of Kanchvijaya and events of Ratha Yatra.</p>
<p>If any festival is considered as a grant event, Rath yatra may be occupying a prominent place in the world event list. This festival falls tow days after new moon day in the month of Ashadha. Pandas carry Lord Jagannath, his brother Balabhadara and sister Subhadra being dressed elegantly on their shoulders up to the newly built chariots with a great pom &amp; ceremony. </p>
<p>This particular moment turns the atmosphere into a holly patch of the rhythmic clang of mental gongs, blowing of conches and trumpet and chanting of holy men. </p>
<p>The ecstatic cries of &#147;Jai Jagannath&#148; rock the entire environment when the overwhelmed jubliant crowds perceive and witness the first appearance of their judictious God amidst them. The large hypnotic eyes of their believed lords as if mesmerize them to work themselves in to a state of devotional frenzy.<br />The all waited patiently magic moment comes to an end when the most beautifully decorated palanquin following procession or elephant and horses of Gajapati - the traditional king of Puri arrives. </p>
<p>As per tradition the king of the king become CHNDALA (Sweeper) and performs the duty of &#147;CHHERA PAHARA&#148; (sweeping activities) of the charitors. The mythology about this traditional sweeping evolves the king as living incarnation of God also accomplish work like a servant on this special occasion which is considered as best example of none valuation and indiscrimination in big and small job. According to one out of lot of stories and traditions, the deities embark on chariots to visit their aunt&#146;s house, which is known, as MAUSIMA TEMPLE is 3 kms away from singhadwar.</p>
<p>NABAKALEBAR is earmarked as a special occasion with newly constructed deities, placed on the chariots after lot of rituals including change of Brahma from the old deities to the New Delhi deities prior to car festival. This Rathyatra is observed as the festival of &#147;Nabakalebar&#148; which falls when tow months of ashada fall in one year. This double ashada occurs at intervals of 8 to 19 years. Around 1072 pieces of wood neither more of less are brought from the earmarked forest for construction of these massive chariots. Assigning the job to the 3 head capenters one for each chariot, the king of Puri instructs to maintain sanctity. </p>
<p>The car of Balabhadara called &#147;Taladwhaja&#148; clads in green and red cloths are 13.2 meters high and are supported by 14 massive wheels. 763 pieces of wood are used for its construciton. The four wooden horses attached to the car are named as Rig, Yaju, Sam and Atharva, which symbolize the four Vedas.</p>
<p>The car of Subhadra otherwise known as &#147;Padmadwhaja&#148; or &#147;Darpadalana&#148; clads with black and red cloth is 12.90 meters high and is supported by 12 wheels. 593 pieces of wood are used in this car. </p>
<p>The four wooden horses attached to this car are named as Prajana, Anupa, Ghose and Agrachi. This largest among the three is &#147;Nandighosa", the car of Lord Jagannath. The height of this legendry can is 13.71 meters and is supported by 16 wheels each of 2.13 meter diameter and adorned with stripes of dazzling yellow and red clothes. The four wooden horses attached to the car are Sankhika, Rochik, Moohika and Twalini.</p>
<p>The deities stay in the Gundicha temple for 9 days. On the 9th day they return to the temple on the chariot &amp; this festivity is called &#147;Bahuda Yatra&#148; (the return for car). On way back to home the deities remain at some places among them one a Mausima temple (his aunt&#146;s mandir). The deities as per custom are offered &#147;Baked cake&#148; known as &#147;PODAPITHA". </p>
<p>After reaching at the main gate of temple the deities wear gold ornaments. Devotees throughout the night celebrate this special day as &#147;SUNABESA". &#147;Adharapana&#148; like sabant (Lasi) is the last offer to God &amp; on the next day of Sunabesa, the deities are taken into the temple to Ratnavedi. This ends the most spectacular RATHA YATRA FOR YEAR.</p>
<p>According to tradition, this festival of Lord is celebrated because of restriction for non-Hindus to see the Lord inside the Sanctum of the Temple. Hence God steps outside so people of all religions and caste can pay their obeisance. </p>
<p>This special darshan of God to common and all castes is envisaged &#147;PATITAPABANA DARSANA". It means the entire communities shall get a chance to communicate their all odds and miseries for quick settlement by the God. </p>
<p>TOPONYMICAL PROBE TRACING ONENESS OF HUMANITY </p>
<p>Pondicherry is a melting pot of various linguistic groups and cultures. Therefore it is no surprise that lot of people from Orissa have found a haven in Pondicherry. Trailing them to study for his research papers R.Balakrishnan I.A.S, often visits Pondicherry.</p>
<p>There is another dimension to his visits, which is to pay respects to his teacher Dr.Vijayavenugopal of Ecole Francaise D&#146;Extreme Orient. Mr.Balakrishnan had presented numerous research papers and he specializes in toponymical probe.</p>
<p>&#147;Place names are fossilized representations of the past. In retracing the footprints of our ancestral migrations, place names can be our guiding stars. </p>
<p>Our case in this regard is built on the foundation that the migrating people do carry their place names and reuse them in new found homeland as a mark of continuity with past.&#148; says R.Balakrishnan explaining the rationale of the toponymical probe he had ventured into.<br />In an article that appeared in the International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, R.Balakrishnan throws &#147;New lights on ancient contacts between Kalinga and Indonesia&#148;.</p>
<p>A study conducted by him revealed remarkable similarities between the place names of Java, Sumatra and Bali regions of Indonesia on one hand and the places of Southern Orissa on the other hand. The Chilka region of Orissa seems to have been the focal point of Kalingan interactions with South East Asia.</p>
<p>Balakrishnan is serious in his research and had done extensive travel to remote regions to draw similarities of place names. In another research paper titled Tamil: A Toponymical Probe he had given a long list of place names that bear the &#147;Tam&#148; prefixes. In a state wise alphabetical list of Tam prefixed place names in India, he states that in Andhra Pradesh [29], Arunachal Pradesh [11], Assam [38], Bihar [53], Gujarat [5), Goa [1], Haryana [3], Himachal Pradesh [34], Karnataka [24], Maharastra [120], Meghalaya [5], Manipur [14], Madya Pradesh [60], Nagaland [4], Orissa [84], Punjab [4], Rajasthan [26], Tamil Nadu [10], Uttar Praseh [64], West Bengal [24] with a grand total of 612 places names resembling Tamil and Tamil influences do occur.</p>
<p>The spread of Tamil conquests and migration <br />This research may sound funny, but researches are always working out new avenues to trace truths of the past. One of the pioneers of rice research in India Mr.Ramiah had identified Jeypore region of Orissa as another independent center of origin of rice. </p>
<p>Subsequent researches established that broad geographical region comprising Jharkand; Chattisgarh, Western Orissa and Jeypore tracts of Orissa satisfy the basic requirements to claim as center of origin of cultivated rice. If one can trace roots of rice cultivation why not trace roots of a civilization and its spread, asks Dr.Arivunambi, Dean of Tamil Studies in Pondicherry University.</p>
<p>&#147;In the Godda District of Bihar there is a village named Tamilgoda. In that District alone there are 12 place names, which end goda Tamilgoda is one of them. </p>
<p>In the Puri District of Orissa a place name called Tamilikudi draws our immediate attention. There is no need to establish the Dravidian etymology of the suffix kudi. </p>
<p>Tamilikudi is not an isolate case of occurrence as there are 37 place names with kudi suffix within the administrative boundary of Orissa.<br />&#147;In the process of locating Tamil related place names the entire list of India was scrutinized and I found a name called Tamia in Chindwara District of Madya Pradesh. Having come across Tamilgoda and Tamilkudi is not surprising to me.</p>
<p>However when this name was noticed in the surprising company of such typical Tamil place names Palani, Tekadi, Theni, Bodi and many other geographical names that are in currency in the Madurai region of Tamilnadu and its adjoining upcountry neighbor Idukki, its significance and implications could be understood,&#148; says Balakrishnan.</p>
<p>Another research paper titled &#147;Toponymy of Konark&#148;, by Balakrishnan traces the spread of the word Kona. The place name of Konark is a combination of two words kona and arka. </p>
<p>A search for Kona as a place name prefix reveals as many as 249 occurrences. Out of this Kona, a mono word place name has been used at least in 13 places [4 in Andhra Pradesh, 3 in Uttar Pradesh, 2 in Madya Pradesh one each in Orissa, Bihar, Haryana and Maharastra]. </p>
<p>Kon seems to be a universal term. &#145;The primitive tribes of Austro-Asiatic and Dravidian origin use the term as much as the speakers of Indo-Aryan do. Even the English terms such as cone, conical based on Latin conus (derived from Greek konus) show definite affinity with the term. <br />Depending on the context, Vedic people used a number of terms to denote angle and most common of them is Karna. </p>
<p>The term Karna means Sun, the son of Kunti by Surya and hence the sun nexus of the term would be obvious. Karna denoting ray or beam of light is considered to be the basis for the Greek term Karneios that means radiant. This establishes the nexus between the angle and ray. </p>
<p>The Peruvian prefix Kon means Sun and the mythical Sun king who claimed direct descent from Sun is called Kon-Tiki. So goes on Balakrishnan identifying in Iran on the Gulf of Oman just 3 km away from main coastline a village called Konark. </p>
<p>About 5 kms away from Persian Gulf he traces another village Konark. Again in the plateau of Iran he finds Konark. The toponymical probe is a new way to establish oneness of the human race. Deveneya Paavanar and his successor R.Madhivanan have used etymological probes to prove that all languages emanated from one common language. </p>
<p>As all continents were once united in Pangea that in Latin means All Earth, the distribution of place names across continents in another way proves continental drift and the migration of human race from one place to another.<br />source from; <a href="http://nandhivarman.tripod.com/" title="http://nandhivarman.tripod.com/">http://nandhivarman.tripod.com/</a><br />courtesy: The New Indian Express -weekend-18.06-2005</p>
