<p>Its amazing how fortunes change - having recd bonus for 2007 @ $18.8<br />billion pool - . The payouts average $600,000 for each of its near<br />30,000 staff worldwide. To being on the streets the next year.</p>
<p>Really sad to see these cream of finance industry on the street.<br />Lehman was the top address you would want to land in - a dream job. <br />with rising paypackets and lot of business that are more intangible as<br />against tangible ( to be read as manufacturing) - guess the youth of<br />today need to look at long term sustenance vs short term rewards.</p>
<p>in our industry ( shipping) which is low pay on entry level and you<br />grow slowly - its been really tough to get new blood - who are happy<br />to answer calls in a different accent, rather than rough it out and<br />get their hands dirty. with the current recession, slow down in the<br />IT industry, we read news of even large outfits keeping people in the<br />bench, having weekly performance tests, campus interview recruitments<br />being delayed even after having given them appointments- guess the<br />youth of today need to make some hard rational decisions.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi,</p>
<p>Whoa.. Louisville eh?:) I was there in February this year for an interview..<br />got the job but finally decided to move back to India instead :)</p>
<p>Anyway, I understand the need to conserve and be environmentally friendly. I<br />am that way too. I also completely agree with our need to reduce dependence<br />on pesticides etc. The GM crops that are being researched into are mainly<br />for that.. how to reduce pesticides.. how to reduce infection by pests.. how<br />to boost yield/acre.. so unlike what is being made out.. agri-biotech firms<br />are not creating franken-foods.. they are trying to solve a very real<br />problem.</p>
<p>Like I said, organic food is not something everyone can afford.. and with<br />the population exploding, we need to find ways to improve our yield.. there<br />are different techniques being tried including molecular breeding as well as<br />biotech food.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Kathie, thank you, am sort of a jack of all trades, when you say<br />  'knowledgable in so many subjects' :)) But perhaps not ignorant generally<br />  speaking :)</p>
<p>  The way you describe your locally grown produce makes my mouth water :) I<br />  live in Kentucky, ranked among the unhealthiest states in the nation. When I<br />  came here there was only one small local health food store that sold among<br />  vitamins and beauty products, a really small quantity of organic produce.<br />  After than Wild Oats and Whole Foods came in and now things have changed<br />  pretty dramatically. Lots of people shop health conscious, atleast here in<br />  Louisville. Although cost remains a fact that has led the Walmarts and<br />  Krogers to stock affordable organic produce , so it is actually a good<br />  thing!! Our farmers markets do well in summer but dont' somehow have the<br />  variety you describe. Or perhaps am too used to whole foods and expect too<br />  much :)<br />  To me in many ways eating wholesome food is a journey back home :) We grew<br />  up that way in India, atleast in my home my grandmother grew most of our<br />  vegetables in the backyard, we had cows and milk/milk products were all home<br />  made too. Quite unimaginable in India now.</p>
<p>  I have issues with people, lots of people including several indians who<br />  think of health food as a 'new age fad' and environmental concerns as<br />  'exaggerated'. It is not at all a 'republican' thing, it is all over as it<br />  challenges the traditional beliefs of 'science' and lifestyle itself in a<br />  way. To this day you cannot talk to several Indians including my own dad on<br />  the ills and side effects of western medicine (just an example).</p>
<p>  Am going on and on as always, sorry. Yes we should talk more. Have you read<br />  Madhur Jaffrey, Indian cookbook writer's memoir - Climbing the Mango Tree?<br />  I'd love to send you a copy. It is a treat on food and home made, healthy<br />  cooking and life of olden days.</p>
<p>  More later,</p>

        <p>Dear Kathie, thank you, am sort of a jack of all trades, when you say 'knowledgable in so many subjects' :)) But perhaps not ignorant generally speaking :)<br />?<br />The way you describe your locally grown produce makes my mouth water :) I live in Kentucky, ranked among the unhealthiest states in the nation. When Icame here there was only one small local health food store that sold amongvitamins and beauty products, a really small quantity of organic produce. After than Wild Oats and Whole Foods came in and now things have changed pretty dramatically. Lots of people shop health conscious, atleast here in Louisville. Although cost remains a fact that has led the Walmarts and Krogers to stock affordable organic produce , so it is actually a good thing!! Our farmers markets do well in summer but dont' somehow have the variety you describe. Or perhaps am too used to whole foods and expect too much :)</p>
<p>To me in many ways eating wholesome food is a journey back home :) We grew up that way in India, atleast in my home my grandmother grew most of our vegetables in the backyard, we had cows and milk/milk products were all home made too. Quite unimaginable in India now. <br />?<br />I have issues with people, lots of people including several indians who think of health food as a 'new age fad' and environmental concerns as 'exaggerated'. It is not at all a 'republican' thing, it is all over as it challenges the traditional beliefs of 'science' and lifestyle itself in a way. To this day you cannot talk to several Indians including my own dad on the illsand side effects of western medicine (just an example). <br />?<br />Am going on and on as always, sorry. Yes we should talk more. Have you readMadhur Jaffrey, Indian cookbook writer's memoir - Climbing the Mango Tree?I'd love to send you a copy. It is a treat on food and home made, healthy cooking and life of olden days.<br />?<br />More later,<br />?<br />Malathi<br />--- On Mon, 9/22/08, Katherine Brobeck <sivadasi@erols.com  wrote:</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Arun/Venkat and all, sorry to jump into this discussion so late but thanks to Hurricane Ike I just got my power back after 8 days. This is a very interesting/close to heart subject for me , am no bio scientist or agri grad but just a foodie and environment conscious person, that is all. <br />?<br />I am not hugely into organic food - or any other fad. But I do care about how my food tastes and what goes into it and must say that I can afford to care.?I started caring many years ago when the quality of vegetables (and milk) in Bangalore declined rather obviously. Bangalore is very well known for juicy tasty veggies and fruit. Towards the time when I left the city for good?(early 90s) most commercially sold veggies started tasting like plastic. House sparrows disappeared due to heavy usage of some pesticide and weeds that hugely promote allergies became rampant. In fact you cannot evenwalk a few steps in Bangalore without seeing weeds. I know little to nothing about organic food in India and how much it costs, just that pesticide based pollution and decline in vegetable taste is 100% real, not imaginary.<br />?<br />The taste of produce in US is what led me to adapt organic produce. A commercially grown tomato in America tastes 100% like plastic. Carrots like rubber. Organic carrots and tomotoes are awesome to taste. Yes expensive I don't disagree but getting to be more affordable, defnitely. I compare costs every week at the local commerical and organic food stores. If you shop smartyou eat tasty food without spending a whole lot extra. Seeraga chamba..yesperhaps exotic rice. But can give Basmati a run for its money. Too bad nobody really popularized it. <br />?<br />Lastly on social issues..how viable is organic farming, how many people it can feed in long run and so on. To my sittravu, that is a veritable chickenand egg story only. To a starving person definitely a commercially grown tomato is a viable option and commerical farming has saved many from starvation. But would every person eat the same 'basic' that a starving person eats? And how about health effects of eating like that? Do I eat commercial and live with all the pollution caused by producing it, or do I try to do what I can, organic or otherwise?<br />?<br />Would love to learn more from all,<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>. Even think about why "organic" </p>
<blockquote><p>  foods are<br />    so expensive?</p></blockquote>
<p>a rather rich farmer from chingelpet brings his organic produce to <br />sell in chennai. only wekends. the sale happens in his house next to <br />MCTM school on alwarpet corner.<br />rarely i find somebody without a car come and buy there.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Very true Arun<br />  i possess a degree in agriculture and did my college project on <br />  organic agriculture.<br />  the organic is successful as a fad for the rich.<br />  its just not possible to feed the teeming millions with organics.<br />  i may not be accurate in comparison but it is like four cartloads <br />of <br />  cowdung versus two sacks of urea. we dont have so much organic <br />  fertiliser nor the logistics to transport so much.</p>
<p>  its just not right to compare ancient agriculture methods. even now <br />  selceted farms grow some ethnic varieties of rice like seeraka <br />samba. <br />  its yield must be about a tenth of what we get even for ir <br />varieties.<br />  yanai katti por adiththathu is all okay but never has agricultural <br />  production per acre or for the whole state ever been so high</p>

<p>    I can expound more on this if there is a general interest in <br />  debating this<br />    issue. If people have already made up their minds, then there is <br />no <br />  point in<br />    discussing it :)</p>

<p>      Very true Divakar. I am no expert in this (ethula tan naan <br />  expert?? :) )</p>
<p>      A couple of months back, i read an article, how big fertilizer <br />  giants<br />      and genetically engineered seed producers break the backbone of<br />      farming. they give free samples to farmers (unofficially) <br />telling <br />  them<br />      to try it out in just a part of their field. Unsuspecting <br />farmers,<br />      when they try it in just less than 10% of their land, find that <br />  the<br />      growth is much more compared to rest of the field. And this<br />      genetically engineered seed, pollinates through air and its <br />more <br />  than<br />      enough to contaminate the rest of the field. So in less than a <br />  decade,<br />      the entire farm is contaminated and can survive only by their <br />seed<br />      variety. Then the govt. will also do research and officially <br />  approve<br />      the new variety of the seed and ten the companies come into <br />  picture<br />      officially and sell their seeds at high price. This has <br />happened <br />  in<br />      the US and now the firms are targeting India. (atleast this is <br />the<br />      summary of what i understand from the article. maybe I am <br />wrong).</p>
<p>      Unless we go back to organic farming and the govt. doesnt do <br />any <br />  good<br />      for the agricultural industry, our future is not guaranteed.</p>

        <p>absolutely.. our average life expectancy has grown tremendously over the<br />last century. And that IS because of human intervention.. so I suppose<br />people would still be dying from typhoid and small pox if we had not<br />intervened.. is that ok? Let's not give polio vaccines then ,... why<br />intervene with loving nature?:p</p>

<p>Hi <br />I joined agriculture mainly because i was intereted in rural energy. <br />and i think right now the demand for historical novelists is <br />higher.....</p>
<p>anyway went to my college reunion, and though the bulk are teachers <br />and scientists we had a handful in other fields. a parliament member, <br />a police dsp, a top executive in coke etc.( and of course a lot of <br />housewives)</p>

<p>But if you look at our older practice, Cow was the jeeva naadi of<br />Indian system. Everyone will be having atleast a few cows and farmers<br />surely will be having 100s (enakku therinche till late 80's my thatha<br />patti had 4 cows in their place in Vellore). Then where comes the<br />matter of transporting? ?namma munnorgal romba buthisaali sir. namathan<br />pazhaya panchagamnu solli othikitom.</p>
<p>Also read somewhere that, it was Robert Clive who, understood this<br />Indian system and cleverly created 1000's of cow butchering centers <br />(with capacity of killing 10000 cows per day) and started killing cows<br />in huge numbers so that modern fertilizers from Europe can be imported<br />to India. This is a double edged strategy, to increase their business<br />as well as to break the backbone of Indian (Hindu) system of life.<br />Again a disclaimer - not sure how far this is true. </p>

        <p>Hi,<br /> <br />How many people are aware of a magazine called "Pasumai vikatan" from vikatan group? This magazine is a good place for the learning natural farming(I am not meaning organic farming). <br /> <br />Difference between organic products and natural products is that natural products marketing does not need a certifying authority, but organic productsneed a certificate from a certifying authority hence making it a costly option.<br /> <br />Regards<br />Nanda</p>

<p>"Anything against nature is not good for us".. </p>
<p>So Satheesh, how about all the medicines we all take? Nature has both good and bad. So shall we stop fighting cancer, Aids etc since that is nature? Also, agriculture is against nature right? Man has been doing selective breeding of animals and crops since the dawn of civilization. . is that not against nature too? </p>

<p>Arun,</p>
<p>Thanks for your expert comments. I understand your point. But again,<br />not just the recent article I read, even years back, i read that<br />genetically modified seeds have adverse effect on the land. Like, only<br />if the same seed is sown, we will get crops, there wont be pollination<br />etc. I think Mansanto (?) faced the protest for this reason. </p>
<p>these are really scary to read, only time has to address these issues :)<br />But I strongly feel, anything against nature is not good for us.</p>

        <p>Sorry Satish :) (and btw, it's Arun .. not Dr. etc :))</p>
<p>In medicine also you are putting in things into your body that are not<br />natural.. chemotherapy, radiation therapy, most drug molecules.. the way<br />drug molecules work is to go and block some protein from doing it's job. So<br />nothing natural about that. It is just in a mindset people have.. when one<br />is sick, one just wants relief.. and doesn't want to ask about what exactly<br />the medicine is.. you DO know that all drugs are tested on mice right?<br />Thousands and thousands of mice are killed before one drug comes onto the<br />market.. I have seen mice with tumor induced in them.. HUGE lumps on them..<br />that of course will take us into a whole different realm of what is ethical<br />and what is not..</p>
<p>What I am saying is that we have been manipulating nature for a long time...<br />Any cross-breeding or selective breeding is a manipulation of nature.</p>

<p>i finished agriculture degree in late eighties. it was a terrible <br />time.<br />scientists like ms swaminathan who spear headed the green revolution <br />dumped tonnes of urea and dap into the field had made a round about.<br />they got awards for fertiliser based agriculture research and <br />continued getting awards telling what a great mistake it was to have <br />done so.</p>

<p>You saw that programme. she said she was the first woman to enter the <br />kitchens of that temple. but i enjoyed the programme.<br />and in this spain programme the dish was chicken rice and prawn with <br />a lot of saffron cooked over a open fire in fish and chicken stock.<br />and she kept tasting it in various stages of cooking.</p>

        <p>I read this thread in bits a pieces ...<br />But my two cents</p>
<p>Farming has to be integrated ... In the sense you should do agriculture /<br />have cattle Goats included / Poultry depending upon the land you have.</p>
<p>1. Planting Agathi Trees around your field and CO - 3 / CO - 4 will take<br />care of the green fodder requirement for your cattle. Since you are doing<br />agriculture there will be plenty of dry fodder available.<br />2. The animal waste will take care your bio fertilizer which you are in<br />need of, provided you save all your animal waste for fertilizer rather than<br />using it for Vaasal Thelikkaradhu / Veedu Mozhugaradhu</p>

<p>   1. Gujarat has considerably incresed the yield of bio cotton, and is in<br />   no. 1 position in India.<br />   2. Many paddy growers have also reported increse in yield when the land<br />   virtually made infertile with chemical fertilisers is exposed to organic<br />   forming.<br />   3. One 80 plus farmer in Gujarat, who was just eaking out a living with<br />   his 10 acre land all his life, has seen income grow in geometric<br />   proportion in the last 5 years; from a few thousand to about 10 crores.<br />   As he paid full tax, income tax officials visited his farm in the last<br />   two years to check. He switched to intensive farming of potatoes with<br />   the help of Mc Donald, and his total produce is bought by Mc Donald.</p>
<p>   There are many such success stories and sob stories. We are in a flux,<br />   and we have to evolve our own model; copying western models will not<br />   work.</p>

<p>     As someone who does research in the biotech field (GM crops), I must<br />   say<br />     that a lot of what seems to have been written in the paper is not<br />   true. THe<br />     population of the world is going to increase to 9 billion in another<br />   40<br />     years. We will have to generate as much food in a decade as was done<br />   in the<br />     previous 10,000 years put together. Add to that water shortages,<br />   global<br />     warming, drought conditions, pestilences and so on. Normal techniques<br />   are<br />     unfortunately not going to cut it. Even think about why "organic"<br />   foods are<br />     so expensive?</p>
<p>     I can expound more on this if there is a general interest in debating<br />   this<br />     issue. If people have already made up their minds, then there is no<br />   point in<br />     discussing it :)</p>

<p>       Very true Divakar. I am no expert in this (ethula tan naan<br />   expert?? :) )</p>
<p>       A couple of months back, i read an article, how big fertilizer<br />   giants<br />       and genetically engineered seed producers break the backbone of<br />       farming. they give free samples to farmers (unofficially) telling<br />   them<br />       to try it out in just a part of their field. Unsuspecting farmers,<br />       when they try it in just less than 10% of their land, find that the<br />       growth is much more compared to rest of the field. And this<br />       genetically engineered seed, pollinates through air and its more<br />   than<br />       enough to contaminate the rest of the field. So in less than a<br />   decade,<br />       the entire farm is contaminated and can survive only by their seed<br />       variety. Then the govt. will also do research and officially approve<br />       the new variety of the seed and ten the companies come into picture<br />       officially and sell their seeds at high price. This has happened in<br />       the US and now the firms are targeting India. (atleast this is the<br />       summary of what i understand from the article. maybe I am wrong).</p>
<p>       Unless we go back to organic farming and the govt. doesnt do any<br />   good<br />       for the agricultural industry, our future is not guaranteed.</p>

One 80 plus farmer in Gujarat, who was just eaking out a living with<br />  his 10 acre land all his life, has seen income grow in geometric<br />  proportion in the last 5 years; from a few thousand to about 10 crores.<br />  As he paid full tax, income tax officials visited his farm in the last<br />  two years to check. He switched to intensive farming of potatoes with<br />  the help of Mc Donald, and his total produce is bought by Mc Donald.</p>
<p>  There are many such success stories and sob stories. We are in a flux,<br />  and we have to evolve our own model; copying western models will not<br />  work.</p>

<p>    As someone who does research in the biotech field (GM crops), I must<br />  say<br />    that a lot of what seems to have been written in the paper is not<br />  true. THe<br />    population of the world is going to increase to 9 billion in another<br />  40<br />    years. We will have to generate as much food in a decade as was done<br />  in the<br />    previous 10,000 years put together. Add to that water shortages,<br />  global<br />    warming, drought conditions, pestilences and so on. Normal techniques<br />  are<br />    unfortunately not going to cut it.

<p>  Very true Arun<br />  i possess a degree in agriculture and did my college project on<br />  organic agriculture.<br />  the organic is successful as a fad for the rich.<br />  its just not possible to feed the teeming millions with organics.<br />  i may not be accurate in comparison but it is like four cartloads of<br />  cowdung versus two sacks of urea. we dont have so much organic<br />  fertiliser nor the logistics to transport so much.</p>
<p>  its just not right to compare ancient agriculture methods. even now<br />  selceted farms grow some ethnic varieties of rice like seeraka samba.<br />  its yield must be about a tenth of what we get even for ir varieties.<br />  yanai katti por adiththathu is all okay but never has agricultural<br />  production per acre or for the whole state ever been so high</p>

        <p>Satheesh,<br />That is a common fallacy. Genetically modified seeds don't affect land. For<br />eg, for Bt cotton, it has been proven that you need less fertilizers and<br />less spraying of insecticides etc.</p>
<p>The other fallacy is about the same seed being sold. This is not a problem<br />with GM crops. this is a problem with Hybrid plants.. any hybrid plants. The<br />reason is that there is a divergence of the trait.</p>
<p>If you think about your Mendelian genetics, let us say there are two pure<br />varieties of plants with traits <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  and <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym ; if you cross them you will get an<br />RS trait. Let us assume this is the hybrid with the good features. If you<br />now cross an RS plant with another RS plant, you can get four different<br />types: <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym , <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym , RS, SR so you see there is dilution even at this stage. If<br />you end up with an <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  or <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  crop unknowingly.. you lose the trait.. or the<br />efficiency decreases. This is why companies selling hybrid seeds insist on<br />buying new seeds every year. It is just science. Unfortunately most people<br />don't understand this. The government of India comes out with Hybrid seeds<br />too .. and this rule applies to that too.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Also, as Venketesh rightly pointed out, we have some of the most inefficient<br />(in terms of yield per acre) agricultural practices in the world. For a<br />burgeoning population, this is not enough. As for organic food, only the<br />rich really eat them, the poor and the hungry millions can't really afford<br />them.</p>

<p>Shriram, Rahul,</p>
<p>Sorry to digress.</p>
<p>I agree with both of you. We cant generalize, but atleast in IT<br />industry, the freshers from the past few years batch (again...please<br />dont take it in wrong sense) people are like what Shriram said.<br />Ofcourse there are gems in the garbage too....but my personal<br />experience and from what I heard from my other colleagues, friends<br />from other companies etc. this is, TO SOME EXTENT TRUE.<br />People dont want to work.Straight from college they want only latest<br />technology projects, in 6 months they want to go onsite, 1 year they<br />want promotion and should be drawing 6 or 8 lakhs (nijama sir,<br />kekaranungale).

<p>But if you look at our older practice, Cow was the jeeva naadi of<br />Indian system. Everyone will be having atleast a few cows and farmers<br />surely will be having 100s (enakku therinche till late 80's my thatha<br />patti had 4 cows in their place in Vellore).

<p>Also read somewhere that, it was Robert Clive who, understood this<br />Indian system and cleverly created 1000's of cow butchering centers <br />(with capacity of killing 10000 cows per day) and started killing cows<br />in huge numbers so that modern fertilizers from Europe can be imported<br />to India. This is a double edged strategy, to increase their business<br />as well as to break the backbone of Indian (Hindu) system of life.<br />Again a disclaimer - not sure how far this is true. </p>

        <p>Arun,</p>
<p>Thanks for your expert comments. I understand your point. But again,<br />not just the recent article I read, even years back, i read that<br />genetically modified seeds have adverse effect on the land. Like, only<br />if the same seed is sown, we will get crops, there wont be pollination<br />etc. I think Mansanto (?) faced the protest for this reason. </p>
<p>these are really scary to read, only time has to address these issues :)<br />But I strongly feel, anything against nature is not good for us.</p>

        <p>Hi Sampath,</p>
<p>You are correct. But like industrialization, the govt should initiate<br />agriculturalization. If it is more commercialised no subsidy is required for<br />the farmers. There is a dept. available in india which is called agriculture<br />dept., which should be improved, aanai katti poradikka vaendaam, but the<br />govt. should buy the hi fi equipments to support the agriculture.</p>
<p>As you said again its debatable but should be addressed seriously.</p>

<p>    Hi Friends,</p>
<p>    There has been lot of changes in our country in the past 15 to 20<br />  years.<br />    For eg.,<br />    * People who uses physical strength doesn't get much money<br />    * Oneside people in IT Sector, Engg' sector, Real estate are making<br />  more<br />    money</p>
<p>    On seeing this the farmers mind is seriously disturbed, I have seen<br />  many<br />    farmers in Trichy and Thanjai areas sold their land (In main areas) to<br />  real<br />    estate people and enjoying the money. On seeing those former farmers<br />  the<br />    others also start thinking to sell their farming lands!! If this<br />  situation<br />    continues it will spread to the interior villages slowly then what<br />  will<br />    happen??</p>
<p>    So the first thing we need is best returns for the farmers, once the<br />    Uzhavars get what they deserved only we can stop this conversion of<br />  farming<br />    land to concrete jungle.</p>
<p>    You remember the uzhavar sandhai's, this was one of a good initiative<br />  but<br />    unfortunately failed...</p>

<p>      A couple of months back, i read an article, how big fertilizer<br />  giants<br />      and genetically engineered seed producers break the backbone of<br />      farming. they give free samples to farmers (unofficially) telling<br />  them<br />      to try it out in just a part of their field. Unsuspecting farmers,<br />      when they try it in just less than 10% of their land, find that the<br />      growth is much more compared to rest of the field. And this<br />      genetically engineered seed, pollinates through air and its more<br />  than<br />      enough to contaminate the rest of the field. So in less than a<br />  decade,<br />      the entire farm is contaminated and can survive only by their seed<br />      variety. Then the govt. will also do research and officially approve<br />      the new variety of the seed and ten the companies come into picture<br />      officially and sell their seeds at high price. This has happened in<br />      the US and now the firms are targeting India. (atleast this is the<br />      summary of what i understand from the article. maybe I am wrong).</p>
<p>      Unless we go back to organic farming and the govt. doesnt do any<br />  good<br />      for the agricultural industry, our future is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>Very true Arun<br />i possess a degree in agriculture and did my college project on <br />organic agriculture.<br />the organic is successful as a fad for the rich.<br />its just not possible to feed the teeming millions with organics.<br />i may not be accurate in comparison but it is like four cartloads of <br />cowdung versus two sacks of urea. we dont have so much organic <br />fertiliser nor the logistics to transport so much.</p>
<p>its just not right to compare ancient agriculture methods. even now <br />selceted farms grow some ethnic varieties of rice like seeraka samba. <br />its yield must be about a tenth of what we get even for ir varieties.<br />yanai katti por adiththathu is all okay but never has agricultural <br />production per acre or for the whole state ever been so high</p>

<p>    A couple of months back, i read an article, how big fertilizer <br />giants<br />    and genetically engineered seed producers break the backbone of<br />    farming. they give free samples to farmers (unofficially) telling <br />them<br />    to try it out in just a part of their field. Unsuspecting farmers,<br />    when they try it in just less than 10% of their land, find that <br />the<br />    growth is much more compared to rest of the field. And this<br />    genetically engineered seed, pollinates through air and its more <br />than<br />    enough to contaminate the rest of the field. So in less than a <br />decade,<br />    the entire farm is contaminated and can survive only by their seed<br />    variety. Then the govt. will also do research and officially <br />approve<br />    the new variety of the seed and ten the companies come into <br />picture<br />    officially and sell their seeds at high price. This has happened <br />in<br />    the US and now the firms are targeting India. (atleast this is the<br />    summary of what i understand from the article. maybe I am wrong).</p>
<p>    Unless we go back to organic farming and the govt. doesnt do any <br />good<br />    for the agricultural industry, our future is not guaranteed.</p>

        <p>Hi Satheesh,<br /> <br />Yes. you are right. Everybody must have some beauty sense. But in india, our ancestors and our ancient people had a verygood esthetic sense. (their buildings are evidences for this).<br /> <br />Do everything in a tourism aspect. for example in the southern Belgium there is a place called Rochehaut (high rock). it is small village.. but they promote tourism like anything. <br />Here we dont need money. just some innovative thoughts. <br /> <br />Shri</p>

<p>Hi Friends,</p>
<p>There has been lot of changes in our country in the past 15 to 20 years.<br />For eg.,<br />* People who uses physical strength doesn't get much money<br />* Oneside people in IT Sector, Engg' sector, Real estate are making more money</p>
<p>On seeing this the farmers mind is seriously disturbed, I have seen many farmers in Trichy and Thanjai areas sold their land (In main areas) to real estate people and enjoying the money. On seeing those former farmers the others also start thinking to sell their farming lands!! If this situation continues it will spread to the interior villages slowly then what will happen?? </p>
<p>So the first thing we need is best returns for the farmers, once the Uzhavars get what they deserved only we can stop this conversion of farming land to concrete jungle.</p>
<p>You remember the uzhavar sandhai's, this was one of a good initiative but unfortunately failed...</p>
<p>Like shri said we need to market the products, but not for the individuals something should be developed...</p>
<p>Lets think..</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satheesh kumar R</p>
<p>2008/9/18 Shriram Rajaram <szriram@yahoo. es </p>
<p>Hi Venkatesh,<br /> <br />Yes, at earlier stage it is difficult. For example, in southern France, theNice (nees) beach was dirty like anything in the early 1900s. But now you see... it is one of the best beaches!<br /> <br />We can start this idea with small groups. first for indians. then slowly people will be aware of this and we can educate them on this. <br /> <br />Please dont mistake me...The Europeans know how to make money out of everything.but in a honest way!  But indians want money without work! (good people please dont get offensive). <br /> <br />Let us think positive!<br /> <br />:)<br /> <br />Shri</p>

<p>Hi <br />great idea for a small state.<br />but I wish you guys will come into the realm of reality.<br />but total agricultre area in tamilnadu alone is 53,200 km². 80 <br />percent of it cant be reached by a tar road.<br />and who is interested in eeing a rice farm.<br />the superimposition of european and american ideas wont work all the <br />time.<br />i saw in travel and living channel a competition on de staminating <br />the saffron flower in spain. it was compered by padma lakshmi of <br />course. all that is lovely to watch on tv. but the reality is grim .<br />venketesh</p>
<p>If the farmers give an ad like this, many</p>
<blockquote><p>  people and academic people can visit these gardens and have an idea <br />on<br />  the flowers etc. this will give some monetory benefits to the <br />farmers<br />  as well..<br />    Â <br />    I have seen this kind of things in France. In india also i wish to<br />  see such things! <br />    Â <br />    Please help me find people and let us join together to work it <br />out.<br />    Â <br />    Shri</p>
<p>  Yes Shriram. you are right.</p>
<p>  In US too, I came across 'Strawberry Picking', 'Apple picking' etc.<br />  Public are allowed in the field with baskets to pick strawberry or<br />  apple, without limits. and they have to pay for the weight of what<br />  they have picked. Much cheaper than the shop and we get fresh goods.<br />  The point is, they pick all the first quality stuff ahead of this, <br />and<br />  the remaining, which are sure to be wasted in transportation or not<br />  worth for sales (like smaller in size and very ripe which might get<br />  damaged) are allowed to the public. Both get benefited. Public get<br />  fresh product for a cheaper rate (good stuff. Does a big or small<br />  strawberry matters as long as its fresh and tastes good?) and the<br />  farmers avoid their wastage (labour, damages, transportation etc). <br />And<br />  you can eat as much as you like in the field for free :) . </p>
<p>  Indirect benefit - public will know what farming is and how it looks<br />  like. I was thinking why we dont do it in India. 'uzhavar sandhai' <br />was<br />  a good concept, but practically failed (even in US we have farmers<br />  market, once a week in some areas).</p>
<p>  The urban life has deprived the new generation from the knowledge of<br />  basics (I heard that in US, many do not know how we get milk. <br />Because<br />  they just pick it from the shop. In wisconsin, there is an annual<br />  festival to show the public how cow is milked :) ).</p>
<p>  I think soon, India will need such things :)</p>

        <p>I have visited a 'self-pick' farm, near Birmingham, UK, several times.<br />You can pick vegetables - potatoes, beans, peas, cabbage and tomatoes,<br />fruits - apple, strawberry - eat as much as you want and pay only for<br />the produce picked. How much can one eat - 3 or 4 apples, 20-25<br />strawberries? and pay for about 5 kgs of each. The fellow at the till<br />does a rough weighing and grunts - 10 pounds.<br />It is a good day's outing; in fact the farm also sells cakes,<br />sandwitches, soft drinks and ice cremes, at (you guessed it) higher<br />prices. One has to drive 40 miles, 65 kms. to do all this. OK as a<br />picnic, not viable financially for the 'picker'.

<blockquote><p>  people and academic people can visit these gardens and have an idea <br />on<br />  the flowers etc. this will give some monetory benefits to the <br />farmers<br />  as well..<br />    Â <br />    I have seen this kind of things in France. In india also i wish to<br />  see such things! <br />    Â <br />    Please help me find people and let us join together to work it <br />out.<br />    Â <br />    Shri</p>
<p>  Yes Shriram. you are right.</p>
<p>  In US too, I came across 'Strawberry Picking', 'Apple picking' etc.<br />  Public are allowed in the field with baskets to pick strawberry or<br />  apple, without limits. and they have to pay for the weight of what<br />  they have picked. Much cheaper than the shop and we get fresh goods.<br />  The point is, they pick all the first quality stuff ahead of this, <br />and<br />  the remaining, which are sure to be wasted in transportation or not<br />  worth for sales (like smaller in size and very ripe which might get<br />  damaged) are allowed to the public. Both get benefited. Public get<br />  fresh product for a cheaper rate (good stuff. Does a big or small<br />  strawberry matters as long as its fresh and tastes good?) and the<br />  farmers avoid their wastage (labour, damages, transportation etc). <br />And<br />  you can eat as much as you like in the field for free :) . </p>
<p>  Indirect benefit - public will know what farming is and how it looks<br />  like. I was thinking why we dont do it in India. 'uzhavar sandhai' <br />was<br />  a good concept, but practically failed (even in US we have farmers<br />  market, once a week in some areas).</p>
<p>  The urban life has deprived the new generation from the knowledge of<br />  basics (I heard that in US, many do not know how we get milk. <br />Because<br />  they just pick it from the shop. In wisconsin, there is an annual<br />  festival to show the public how cow is milked :) ).</p>
<p>  I think soon, India will need such things :)</p>

        <p>:O Europeans want to transfer work to indians?<br /> <br />This is the first time im hearing such a statement. It is usually Americanswho do this! Since they have presence of their companies in Europe to, they check for people in other parts of the world. <br /> <br />Since i have lived in Europe and studied their language and culture, i havelearnt many good things from them. especially French! they are more service oriented and know to enjoy life too...<br /> <br />:)  <br /> <br />friendly,<br />Shriram</p>

<p>Shriram; Good that you mentioned "good people please dont get offensive"! Because what you declared is quite an offensive statement. You probably know more about Europe but from my own experiences of dealing with Europeans for the past few years what you have declared is totally false. Europeans are more than happy to transfer work to us, Indians, than do it themselves.<br />I dont want to change the subject of this thread. Im stopping here.</p>

        <p>Hi Friends,</p>
<p>There has been lot of changes in our country in the past 15 to 20 years.<br />For eg.,<br />* People who uses physical strength doesn't get much money<br />* Oneside people in IT Sector, Engg' sector, Real estate are making more<br />money</p>
<p>On seeing this the farmers mind is seriously disturbed, I have seen many<br />farmers in Trichy and Thanjai areas sold their land (In main areas) to real<br />estate people and enjoying the money. On seeing those former farmers the<br />others also start thinking to sell their farming lands!! If this situation<br />continues it will spread to the interior villages slowly then what will<br />happen??</p>
<p>So the first thing we need is best returns for the farmers, once the<br />Uzhavars get what they deserved only we can stop this conversion of farming<br />land to concrete jungle.</p>
<p>You remember the uzhavar sandhai's, this was one of a good initiative but<br />unfortunately failed...</p>
<p>Like shri said we need to market the products, but not for the individuals<br />something should be developed...</p>
<p>Lets think..</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satheesh kumar R</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  Yes, at earlier stage it is difficult. For example, in southern France, the<br />  Nice (nees) beach was dirty like anything in the early 1900s. But now you<br />  see... it is one of the best beaches!</p>
<p>  We can start this idea with small groups. first for indians. then slowly<br />  people will be aware of this and we can educate them on this.</p>
<p>  Please dont mistake me...The Europeans know how to make money out of<br />  everything.but in a honest way! But indians want money without work! (good<br />  people please dont get offensive).</p>
<p>  Let us think positive!</p>

<p>  If the farmers give an ad like this, many<br />    people and academic people can visit these gardens and have an idea<br />  on<br />    the flowers etc. this will give some monetory benefits to the<br />  farmers<br />    as well..<br />      ?<br />      I have seen this kind of things in France.

<p>    Yes Shriram. you are right.</p>
<p>    In US too, I came across 'Strawberry Picking', 'Apple picking' etc.<br />    Public are allowed in the field with baskets to pick strawberry or<br />    apple, without limits. and they have to pay for the weight of what<br />    they have picked. Much cheaper than the shop and we get fresh goods.<br />    The point is, they pick all the first quality stuff ahead of this,<br />  and<br />    the remaining, which are sure to be wasted in transportation or not<br />    worth for sales (like smaller in size and very ripe which might get<br />    damaged) are allowed to the public. Both get benefited. Public get<br />    fresh product for a cheaper rate (good stuff. Does a big or small<br />    strawberry matters as long as its fresh and tastes good?) and the<br />    farmers avoid their wastage (labour, damages, transportation etc).<br />  And<br />    you can eat as much as you like in the field for free :) .</p>
<p>    Indirect benefit - public will know what farming is and how it looks<br />    like. I was thinking why we dont do it in India. 'uzhavar sandhai'<br />  was<br />    a good concept, but practically failed (even in US we have farmers<br />    market, once a week in some areas).</p>
<p>    The urban life has deprived the new generation from the knowledge of<br />    basics (I heard that in US, many do not know how we get milk.<br />  Because<br />    they just pick it from the shop.

        <p>Shriram; Good that you mentioned "good people please dont get offensive"! Because<br />what you declared is quite an offensive statement. You probably know more<br />about Europe but from my own experiences of dealing with Europeans for the<br />past few years what you have declared is totally false. Europeans are more<br />than happy to transfer work to us, Indians, than do it themselves.<br />I dont want to change the subject of this thread. Im stopping here.</p>

        <p>Hi Venkatesh,<br /> <br />Yes, at earlier stage it is difficult. For example, in southern France, theNice (nees) beach was dirty like anything in the early 1900s. But now you see... it is one of the best beaches!<br /> <br />We can start this idea with small groups. first for indians. then slowly people will be aware of this and we can educate them on this. <br /> <br />Please dont mistake me...The Europeans know how to make money out of everything.but in a honest way!  But indians want money without work!

        <p>Satish,</p>
<p>As someone who does research in the biotech field (GM crops), I must say<br />that a lot of what seems to have been written in the paper is not true. THe<br />population of the world is going to increase to 9 billion in another 40<br />years. We will have to generate as much food in a decade as was done in the<br />previous 10,000 years put together. Add to that water shortages, global<br />warming, drought conditions, pestilences and so on. Normal techniques are<br />unfortunately not going to cut it. Even think about why "organic" foods are<br />so expensive?</p>
<p>I can expound more on this if there is a general interest in debating this<br />issue. If people have already made up their minds, then there is no point in<br />discussing it :)</p>

<p>  A couple of months back, i read an article, how big fertilizer giants<br />  and genetically engineered seed producers break the backbone of<br />  farming. they give free samples to farmers (unofficially) telling them<br />  to try it out in just a part of their field. Unsuspecting farmers,<br />  when they try it in just less than 10% of their land, find that the<br />  growth is much more compared to rest of the field. And this<br />  genetically engineered seed, pollinates through air and its more than<br />  enough to contaminate the rest of the field. So in less than a decade,<br />  the entire farm is contaminated and can survive only by their seed<br />  variety. Then the govt. will also do research and officially approve<br />  the new variety of the seed and ten the companies come into picture<br />  officially and sell their seeds at high price. This has happened in<br />  the US and now the firms are targeting India. (atleast this is the<br />  summary of what i understand from the article. maybe I am wrong).</p>
<p>  Unless we go back to organic farming and the govt. doesnt do any good<br />  for the agricultural industry, our future is not guaranteed.</p>

        <p>yes...what you say is correct..<br /> <br />Is there anybody in the group who has farm lands or know some friendly farmers with whom we can start this concept.<br /> <br />Please support us finding people!<br /> <br />Shri</p>

<p>people and academic people can visit these gardens and have an idea on<br />the flowers etc. this will give some monetory benefits to the farmers<br />as well..</p>

<p>Yes Shriram. you are right.</p>
<p>In US too, I came across 'Strawberry Picking', 'Apple picking' etc.<br />Public are allowed in the field with baskets to pick strawberry or<br />apple, without limits. and they have to pay for the weight of what<br />they have picked. Much cheaper than the shop and we get fresh goods.<br />The point is, they pick all the first quality stuff ahead of this, and<br />the remaining, which are sure to be wasted in transportation or not<br />worth for sales (like smaller in size and very ripe which might get<br />damaged) are allowed to the public. Both get benefited. Public get<br />fresh product for a cheaper rate (good stuff. Does a big or small<br />strawberry matters as long as its fresh and tastes good?) and the<br />farmers avoid their wastage (labour, damages, transportation etc). And<br />you can eat as much as you like in the field for free :) . </p>
<p>Indirect benefit - public will know what farming is and how it looks<br />like. I was thinking why we dont do it in India. 'uzhavar sandhai' was<br />a good concept, but practically failed (even in US we have farmers<br />market, once a week in some areas).</p>
<p>The urban life has deprived the new generation from the knowledge of<br />basics (I heard that in US, many do not know how we get milk. Because<br />they just pick it from the shop. In wisconsin, there is an annual<br />festival to show the public how cow is milked :) ).</p>
<p>I think soon, India will need such things :)</p>
