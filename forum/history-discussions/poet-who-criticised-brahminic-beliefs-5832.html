<p>Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the Brahmin<br />dominated society and caste system of his period. I have given two<br />poems below which echo this feelings,</p>
<p>In bricks and in granite,</p>
<p>in the red rubbed lingam,</p>
<p>in copper and brass,</p>
<p>is Siva's adobe-</p>
<p>thats what you tell us,</p>
<p>and you are wrong.</p>
<p>Stay where you are</p>
<p>and study your own selves.</p>
<p>Then you will BECOME</p>
<p>the Temple of GOD,</p>
<p>full of his dance and spell</p>
<p>and song.</p>
<p>??..<br />?..<br />..</p>
<p>What does it mean - a Pariah woman?</p>
<p>What does it mean - a Brahmin women?</p>
<p>Is there any difference in flesh,</p>
<p>skin,or bones?</p>
<p>Do you feel any difference when you sleep</p>
<p>with a Pariah or Brahmin woman?</p>

<p>  and the basic introduction as<br />  'Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the <br />established<br />  religious structure and caste system of his period. I have given <br />two<br />  poems below which echo this feelings'.</p>
<p>  Thank you for all the members who contributed in this thread and<br />  presented their view and helped me understand the poems better.</p>

          Poet who criticised the Brahminic beliefs        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,<br />Based on discussions on this forum and Mintamil forum(where<br />Dr.N.Kannan had given a beautiful explanation about these two shidda<br />poems) , I have changed by blog title to<br />'Poet who criticized the prevalent religious beliefs -Civavakiyar<br />poems - Civavakaiyam'</p>
<p>and the basic introduction as<br />'Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the established<br />religious structure and caste system of his period. I have given two<br />poems below which echo this feelings'.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the members who contributed in this thread and<br />presented their view and helped me understand the poems better.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The facts about Civavakkiyar is as below,</p>
<p>Name:<br />Legend: He uttered the word Shiva while he was born.<br />Possible truth: Named after his work Civavakkiyam.</p>
<p>Period:<br />First there needs this clarification - There are two Pattinattar in<br />Tamil literature.<br />One in 10th century and author of Thriuvidamarudur Mummani Kovai<br />other in 14th - 15th century.<br />Other in 14-15th century and his works are compiled as Ptinathar Padalgal.</p>
<p>The first Patinathar quoted a Civavakkiya Tevar in his poem. This<br />makes age of Civavakkiyar earlier to 10th century.</p>
<p>But Author of Civavakkiyam seems to have great knowledge in Saiva<br />Shiddantha and has used Urdu loan words in his work. This makes his <br />works dated to later period.</p>
<p>He is quoted by Tattuvaryar(14century) and Civananavallal(15 century)<br />and commentary of Maraianacampanthar. This puts in a Age before 16th<br />century.</p>
<p>The solution provided by scholars is that possibly Civavakkiyatevar<br />was different from the author of Civavakkiyam.</p>
<p>This puts the dating of Author of Civavakkiyam- Civavakkiyar to around<br />13-15th century.</p>
<p>Life:<br />Legend: Born as a Brahmin, married a low community women(Kuravar<br />women), received initiations form guru Konkanar and started performing<br />miracles.He is supposed to have made pilgrimage to Benares(this might<br />be based on allusions in one of his poems).</p>

<p>  ===================<br />  PN Bose :: Epoches of Civilisation.</p>
<p>  Judged by the standard of the motive or the ruling idea alone, each<br />  of the Literature can be classified under the Naturalistic, the<br />  Ethical and the Religeous.</p>
<p>  The poem composed during the Naturalistic period, man's life and his<br />  surroundings are dealt with in their most elementary phases and the<br />  poets, one and all, seem occupied with depicting these in<br />  their "unadorned simplicity".</p>
<p>  In the Ethical period, however they try to grapple with the<br />  questions of conduct and character arising from the various complex<br />  relations of life in soceity and appear generally preoccupied with<br />  the evolution of a code of morals and polity to form the basis of an<br />  ordered social life;   <br />  In the Religeous period, the Poets seem to quit man's earthly<br />  existence and his limited interests therein and turned on a higher<br />  and grander sphere, the destiny of his soul beyond time.</p>
<p>  In the first period, their lives took on a secular colour and came<br />  to be reflected as such in the literature of that period. The<br />  impulse of religion, which came to possess them at a later period,<br />  was then absent...,,,,</p>
<p>  ....... the Jains and the Buddhists seem to have been the earlier<br />  batches, all facts and traditions considered..xxxxxxx</p>
<p>  " Sangam " was a College / Institution of Jain (Buddhist) ascetics.<br />  till 7th AD. The very name " Sangam " unknown to early Tamils<br />  proclaims its late origin..since in NONE OF THE SANGAM works, there<br />  is any reference to Sangam....</p>
<p>  XXXXX The period of duration of 3 academies put together is 9990<br />  years - distributed among 197 Pandya Kings..</p>
<p>  Thalayanganathu Pandiayns Capital was KUDAL .. and naming of Mathura<br />  should have been a later addition...</p>
<p>  Now recall AINKURUNURU by Pulathurai mutriya Kudalur Kizhar during<br />  Yanaikkann chei Mandarilurnchera Irumborai.. !</p>
<p>  In this, Marutham by Orambokiyar;   Neythal by Ammuvanar;   Kurinji by Kapilar;   Paalai by Otal Anthaiyar; and<br />  Mullai by Peryanar.</p>
<p>  Now ORAMBOKIYAR has contributed 2 Marutham poems in Agananuru;   2 in Natrinai;   4 in Kurunthogai.</p>
<p>  Ammuvanar has contributed 5 Neythal poems in Agananuru;   10 in Natrinai;   11 in Kurunthogai;   <br />  Kapilar has contributed 17 Kurunji + 1 paalai poems in Agnanuru;   19 in Natrinai;   29 in Kurunthogai;   31 in Purananuru.</p>
<p>  Otalantaiyar contributed 3 palai poems inKuruntogai.</p>
<p>  Peyanar contributed 1 Mullai song in Agananuru;   4 in Kuruntogai.</p>
<p>  Perundevanar has compiled these..<br />  ===============================</p>
<p>  Dear Vairam,</p>
<p>  These details are in our Archieves ..</p>
<p>  Let us try to place Siva vaickiar's period ...</p>
<p>  and Siddhars in detail..</p>
<p>  Dr. jaybee has contributed widely in his viswacomplex archieves..</p>
<p>  We can furnish details acknowledging his contributions..</p>
<p>  thanks and regards / sps</p>
<p>    It is widely accepted that these two Nakkirars are same....<br />    There are also poets named Nakkirar in 11 th century and <br />  later...but<br />    their works are no way famous and no where near good...so they are<br />    believed to be poets with same names...and not the same poet....<br />    And there are at least 3 poets with name Nakkirar....<br />    similar trend is with Agathiyar and Auvaiyar....Atleast Auvaiyar <br />  was<br />    Sangam poet whose name was used by subsequent poets....but <br />  Agathiyar<br />    is total mythical character to bring in Aryan religion into Tamil's<br />    Divinity and his name is used from naadi edu to shidda medical <br />  text...</p>
<p>    Nakkirar is of third sangam...as there is no proof for existence of<br />    first two sangams.....<br />    The three sangam concepts were only introduced by Nakkirar some <br />  where<br />    between 6-9th century in his commentary to Iraivanar Agaporul....<br />    None of the literature before has any reference to three<br />    sangams...even in sangam literature there is no reference...</p>
<p>    There are reference in Jain sources that Jains started a Sangam for<br />    Tamil in Madurai...<br />    There are also reference here and there that there might have been<br />    committee of poets setup in and around Madurai ....<br />    So the possiblity is there was some kind of Academy of poets in<br />    Madurai and surely it was not as big and as organized as it is <br />  quoted<br />    by Nakkirar(i.e the three sangam lasted for so many thousand years)</p>
<p>    No idea about Bogar as of now....But there are more myths than <br />  facts<br />    concerned with Bogar.</p>

<p>      The words in tamil sound different from words in english...to me <br />      atleast. <br />      As with any words, it is in the eye of the beholder.<br />      I read it as a hardcore siva thathuvam and i would also deduce <br />  the <br />      pariah / brahmin to iccha/kriya to be embedded inside the body.<br />      I am not to believe Sivavakiyar was into social reforms and <br />  there is <br />      no reason to believe so. His words from other poems also seem <br />      pointing to a higher end of philosophy and siva thathuvams.<br />      --- etho yen sitrarivukku yettiyathu...</p>
<p>      Mr.Vairam, revisiting the older thread, has there been any study <br />  of <br />      the St.Bogar and his uruva vazhipadu of Lord Muruga compared to <br />  the <br />      1st sangam age? <br />      Any documentation of Bogar's time line to Nakeerar or pallava <br />      dynasty, i would be curious.</p>

<p>        Vairam,</p>
<p>        Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your <br />  site, i <br />      was wondering about the <br />        intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about <br />      criticizing a community (atleast <br />        to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in <br />  any <br />      of the sitthar songs</p>
<p>        First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />  Second <br />      is just a comparison to <br />        say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />  method <br />      of comparison.</p>
<p>        Can you post the full song and the translation from the book <br />  are <br />      quoting this? Please post <br />        from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses <br />  were <br />      criticizing brahmin <br />        dominated community?</p>
<p>        Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those <br />  years. </p>

<p>In the Ethical period, however they try to grapple with the<br />questions of conduct and character arising from the various complex<br />relations of life in soceity and appear generally preoccupied with<br />the evolution of a code of morals and polity to form the basis of an<br />ordered social life;</p>
<p>In the Religeous period, the Poets seem to quit man's earthly<br />existence and his limited interests therein and turned on a higher<br />and grander sphere, the destiny of his soul beyond time.</p>
<p>In the first period, their lives took on a secular colour and came<br />to be reflected as such in the literature of that period. The<br />impulse of religion, which came to possess them at a later period,<br />was then absent...,,,,</p>
<p>....... the Jains and the Buddhists seem to have been the earlier<br />batches, all facts and traditions considered..xxxxxxx</p>
<p>" Sangam " was a College / Institution of Jain (Buddhist) ascetics.<br />till 7th AD. The very name " Sangam " unknown to early Tamils<br />proclaims its late origin..since in NONE OF THE SANGAM works, there<br />is any reference to Sangam....</p>
<p>XXXXX The period of duration of 3 academies put together is 9990<br />years - distributed among 197 Pandya Kings..</p>
<p>Thalayanganathu Pandiayns Capital was KUDAL .. and naming of Mathura<br />should have been a later addition...</p>
<p>Now recall AINKURUNURU by Pulathurai mutriya Kudalur Kizhar during<br />Yanaikkann chei Mandarilurnchera Irumborai.. !</p>
<p>In this, Marutham by Orambokiyar; Neythal by Ammuvanar; Kurinji by Kapilar; Paalai by Otal Anthaiyar; and<br />Mullai by Peryanar.</p>
<p>Now ORAMBOKIYAR has contributed 2 Marutham poems in Agananuru; 2 in Natrinai; 4 in Kurunthogai.</p>
<p>Ammuvanar has contributed 5 Neythal poems in Agananuru; 10 in Natrinai; 11 in Kurunthogai;</p>
<p>Kapilar has contributed 17 Kurunji + 1 paalai poems in Agnanuru; 19 in Natrinai; 29 in Kurunthogai; 31 in Purananuru.</p>

<p>Dr. jaybee has contributed widely in his viswacomplex archieves..</p>
<p>We can furnish details acknowledging his contributions..</p>

<blockquote><p>  It is widely accepted that these two Nakkirars are same....<br />  There are also poets named Nakkirar in 11 th century and <br />later...but<br />  their works are no way famous and no where near good...so they are<br />  believed to be poets with same names...and not the same poet....<br />  And there are at least 3 poets with name Nakkirar....<br />  similar trend is with Agathiyar and Auvaiyar....Atleast Auvaiyar <br />was<br />  Sangam poet whose name was used by subsequent poets....but <br />Agathiyar<br />  is total mythical character to bring in Aryan religion into Tamil's<br />  Divinity and his name is used from naadi edu to shidda medical <br />text...</p>
<p>  Nakkirar is of third sangam...as there is no proof for existence of<br />  first two sangams.....<br />  The three sangam concepts were only introduced by Nakkirar some <br />where<br />  between 6-9th century in his commentary to Iraivanar Agaporul....<br />  None of the literature before has any reference to three<br />  sangams...even in sangam literature there is no reference...</p>
<p>  There are reference in Jain sources that Jains started a Sangam for<br />  Tamil in Madurai...<br />  There are also reference here and there that there might have been<br />  committee of poets setup in and around Madurai ....<br />  So the possiblity is there was some kind of Academy of poets in<br />  Madurai and surely it was not as big and as organized as it is <br />quoted<br />  by Nakkirar(i.e the three sangam lasted for so many thousand years)</p>
<p>  No idea about Bogar as of now....But there are more myths than <br />facts<br />  concerned with Bogar.</p>

<p>      Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your <br />site, i <br />    was wondering about the <br />      intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about <br />    criticizing a community (atleast <br />      to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in <br />any <br />    of the sitthar songs</p>
<p>      First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />Second <br />    is just a comparison to <br />      say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />method <br />    of comparison.</p>
<p>      Can you post the full song and the translation from the book <br />are <br />    quoting this? Please post <br />      from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses <br />were <br />    criticizing brahmin <br />      dominated community?</p>

<p>    Bogar samadhi and Palani temple have been real so point of <br />contention <br />    by logic is, when was the statue made (in nava pashanam) and who <br />made <br />    it if Bogar is a myth.

          Poet who criticised the Brahminic beliefs        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Well then, that is the rule of thumb to any saint.<br />A person in Civavakiyar's position can obviously say that 'hariyum <br />sivanum onnu ariyatavar vayile mannu'. But that does not work from <br />day one for any person. It would rather land up as dangerous, I <br />personally believe these rebellious messages landed up in period of <br />time where there was discrimination against some communities, while <br />not exactly liberating others.</p>
<p>He was a great saint, I am sure he had brahmin devotees at his time <br />and I am sure he has worshipped idols on his way too. I do not think <br />it is fair to read his works with a narrow thought process. A person <br />who see's multiple samathuvams in one, is bound to see humans as one <br />and idols to non idols. That level is not reached in day 1 of <br />progress.</p>
<p>I would suggest reading his works with a way too broader mind than <br />constraining it to a small social reforming path. I am reading the <br />verses and to me it is extraordinary genius.</p>

<p>    Dear Vairam</p>
<p>    I dont really see any brahminical criticisum in here. His model <br />of <br />    work is again different from the vedic prescribed paths. He jus <br />    advocates the yogi/sanyasi path.</p>
<p>    I can only conclude two things from these poems, either he is <br />talking <br />    highest epitome of self realization or just dismiss them as <br />rumblings <br />    of a person with unstable mind.</p>
<p>    Either case, it is difficult for me to correlate a social <br />denouncing <br />    of brahmins, especially if I were to consider him to be a person <br />of <br />    serious spiritual nature. </p>
<p>    It would be interesting to read other people's interpretations.</p>

<p>        Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your <br />site, i<br />      was wondering about the <br />        intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about<br />      criticizing a community (atleast <br />        to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in <br />any <br />    of<br />      the sitthar songs</p>
<p>        First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />Second <br />    is<br />      just a comparison to <br />        say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />method <br />    of<br />      comparison.</p>
<p>        Can you post the full song and the translation from the book <br />are<br />      quoting this? Please post <br />        from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses <br />were<br />      criticizing brahmin <br />        dominated community?</p>
<p>        Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those <br />years. </p>

<p>          Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the <br />Brahmin<br />          dominated society and caste system of his period. I have <br />given <br />    two<br />          poems below which echo this feelings,</p>

          Poet who criticised the Brahminic beliefs        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>The exact words of Kamil Zvelebil are as below<br />"Civavakkiyar was one of the greatest rebels against the hindu<br />establishment,particularly against the brahminic order of things,he<br />denounces the Brahmans,the authority of vedas and the aagamas,he<br />condemns idol worship and temple cermonies.He is implacable opponent<br />of caste system.He is against all forms of orthodoxy.He ignores the<br />division between the Saivites and Vaishnavites.Such rebellion against<br />relegious orthodoxy and sacerdotalism was simply ignored by the<br />established tradition,and his poems,numbering 527 stanzas,were left<br />out of Saiva canonical literature."</p>
<p>And these are words of T.P.Meenakshisundaram from A history of Tamil<br />Literature "There is forceful clarity,shocking us sometimes by its<br />forthright directness;he is not even afraid of using terms that prigs<br />will call vulgar or obsene"</p>
<p>And again words of Kamil V Z "Civavakkiyar may be considered as a<br />landmark in the history of Tamil thought and writing."</p>

<p>  Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your site, i<br />was wondering about the <br />  intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about<br />criticizing a community (atleast <br />  to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in any of<br />the sitthar songs</p>
<p>  First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. Second is<br />just a comparison to <br />  say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this method of<br />comparison.</p>
<p>  Can you post the full song and the translation from the book are<br />quoting this? Please post <br />  from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses were<br />criticizing brahmin <br />  dominated community?</p>
<p>  Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those years. </p>

None of the two stanza's talk anything about <br />    criticizing a community (atleast <br />      to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in <br />any <br />    of the sitthar songs</p>
<p>      First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />Second <br />    is just a comparison to <br />      say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />method <br />    of comparison.</p>
<p>      Can you post the full song and the translation from the book <br />are <br />    quoting this? Please post <br />      from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses <br />were <br />    criticizing brahmin <br />      dominated community?</p>
<p>      Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those years. </p>
<p>      Regards,<br />      Satish</p>

          Poet who criticised the Brahminic beliefs        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Vairam</p>
<p>I dont really see any brahminical criticisum in here. His model of <br />work is again different from the vedic prescribed paths. He jus <br />advocates the yogi/sanyasi path.</p>
<p>I can only conclude two things from these poems, either he is talking <br />highest epitome of self realization or just dismiss them as rumblings <br />of a person with unstable mind.</p>
<p>Either case, it is difficult for me to correlate a social denouncing <br />of brahmins, especially if I were to consider him to be a person of <br />serious spiritual nature. </p>
<p>It would be interesting to read other people's interpretations.</p>
<p>PS: Going by his words in as is where model, there are 7 worlds <br />(however it be in spit), I will be curious to find the factual <br />evidence of these worlds.</p>

<blockquote><p>  HI ,<br />  This is a quick reply....<br />  There are series of poems,where he questions the rituals of <br />brahmins....<br />  Kamil Zvelebil goes on to say he questioned the Brahmin domination <br />in<br />  relegion so much that....even though his work was about Siva and was<br />  deeply philosophical it was not added to the Saiva Cannon.....I will<br />  soon quote the exact words of Zvelebil</p>
<p>  this is one of my old post<br />  <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/cittar-poems-" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/cittar-poems-">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/cittar-poems-</a><br />civavakkiyar/</p>

<p>  you who take always sacred baths</p>
<p>  you who kindle sacrifical fires</p>
<p>  you who pour in tons of ghee</p>

<p>  hear</p>

<p>  The veda you recite is spit. The mantras in it are - spit.</p>
<p>  All pleasures are but spit. All seven worlds are - spit.</p>
<p>  Honeyed sperm is spit.Intellect is spit.Enlightment is - spit</p>
<p>  There is nothing, indeed, nothing that is not spit!</p>
<p>  These two poems directly attack the brahminic practices....<br />  I usally post Civavakiyar at times since it add variety to my<br />  blog...my blogs are usually devoted to Sangam literature....<br />  His poetry is pretty hard and not soft coated as we expect a<br />  devotional song to be...<br />  And Cittar padalgal are bit unexplored area as well....</p>
<p>  If you want further reference....i will quote soon....I just saw ur<br />  post now...so i am answering imm..i dont have any of my books with <br />me now</p>

        <p>Nakkirar is dated any where between 6-9 th century<br />The most famous work of this Nakkirar is a commentary to Iraivanar<br />Agaporul....since time period of Thirumurgatrupadai is also same...<br />It is widely accepted that these two Nakkirars are same....<br />There are also poets named Nakkirar in 11 th century and later...but<br />their works are no way famous and no where near good...so they are<br />believed to be poets with same names...and not the same poet....<br />And there are at least 3 poets with name Nakkirar....<br />similar trend is with Agathiyar and Auvaiyar....Atleast Auvaiyar was<br />Sangam poet whose name was used by subsequent poets....but Agathiyar<br />is total mythical character to bring in Aryan religion into Tamil's<br />Divinity and his name is used from naadi edu to shidda medical text...</p>
<p>Nakkirar is of third sangam...as there is no proof for existence of<br />first two sangams.....<br />The three sangam concepts were only introduced by Nakkirar some where<br />between 6-9th century in his commentary to Iraivanar Agaporul....<br />None of the literature before has any reference to three<br />sangams...even in sangam literature there is no reference...</p>
<p>There are reference in Jain sources that Jains started a Sangam for<br />Tamil in Madurai...<br />There are also reference here and there that there might have been<br />committee of poets setup in and around Madurai ....<br />So the possiblity is there was some kind of Academy of poets in<br />Madurai and surely it was not as big and as organized as it is quoted<br />by Nakkirar(i.e the three sangam lasted for so many thousand years)</p>
<p>No idea about Bogar as of now....But there are more myths than facts<br />concerned with Bogar.</p>

          Poet who criticised the Brahminic beliefs        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>HI ,<br />This is a quick reply....<br />There are series of poems,where he questions the rituals of brahmins....<br />Kamil Zvelebil goes on to say he questioned the Brahmin domination in<br />relegion so much that....even though his work was about Siva and was<br />deeply philosophical it was not added to the Saiva Cannon.....I will<br />soon quote the exact words of Zvelebil</p>
<p>this is one of my old post<br /><a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/cittar-poems-civavakkiyar/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/cittar-poems-civavakkiyar/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/cittar-poems-civavakkiyar/</a></p>
<p>Listen</p>
<p>you who take always sacred baths</p>
<p>you who kindle sacrifical fires</p>
<p>you who pour in tons of ghee</p>
<p>hear words of wisdom</p>
<p>hear</p>
<p>The Fires and holy waters</p>
<p>are within</p>
<p>Behold</p>
<p>remember and attest</p>
<p>An endless undiminished light</p>
<p>will appear and union in oneness</p>
<p>be </p>
<p>41.</p>
<p>The veda you recite is spit. The mantras in it are - spit.</p>
<p>All pleasures are but spit. All seven worlds are - spit.</p>
<p>Honeyed sperm is spit.Intellect is spit.Enlightment is - spit</p>
<p>There is nothing, indeed, nothing that is not spit!</p>
<p>These two poems directly attack the brahminic practices....<br />I usally post Civavakiyar at times since it add variety to my<br />blog...my blogs are usually devoted to Sangam literature....<br />His poetry is pretty hard and not soft coated as we expect a<br />devotional song to be...<br />And Cittar padalgal are <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  unexplored area as well....</p>
<p>If you want further reference....i will quote soon....I just saw ur<br />post now...so i am answering imm..i dont have any of my books with me now</p>

<p>  Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your site, i<br />was wondering about the <br />  intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about<br />criticizing a community (atleast <br />  to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in any of<br />the sitthar songs</p>
<p>  First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. Second is<br />just a comparison to <br />  say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this method of<br />comparison.</p>
<p>  Can you post the full song and the translation from the book are<br />quoting this? Please post <br />  from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses were<br />criticizing brahmin <br />  dominated community?</p>
<p>  Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those years. </p>

<p>    Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the Brahmin<br />    dominated society and caste system of his period. I have given two<br />    poems below which echo this feelings,</p>

        <p>The words in tamil sound different from words in english...to me <br />atleast. <br />As with any words, it is in the eye of the beholder.<br />I read it as a hardcore siva thathuvam and i would also deduce the <br />pariah / brahmin to iccha/kriya to be embedded inside the body.<br />I am not to believe Sivavakiyar was into social reforms and there is <br />no reason to believe so. His words from other poems also seem <br />pointing to a higher end of philosophy and siva thathuvams.<br />--- etho yen sitrarivukku yettiyathu...</p>
<p>Mr.Vairam, revisiting the older thread, has there been any study of <br />the St.Bogar and his uruva vazhipadu of Lord Muruga compared to the <br />1st sangam age? <br />Any documentation of Bogar's time line to Nakeerar or pallava <br />dynasty, i would be curious.</p>
