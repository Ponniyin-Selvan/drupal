        <p>I disagree. What you has to do with you and your personality, it is not possible to delink the two. I did not attack you I just said what you said sounded ungrateful that is all. And if you live abroad you develop certain perspectives that people living in India don't.<br />?<br />What exactly is wrong with that? Venkat, I am very much hurt and disappointed with your response.?I have made my subscription to read from the site and am not sure want to write any more. I hope you don't mind reading what is knowledgable here. If not let me know, no problem.<br />?<br />Thanks<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi <br />I agree. true. gandhi evokes different emotions from different people <br />ranging from reverence to highly critical.</p>
<p>i am sure Gandhi himself was a person with a keen sense of history <br />and knew the future would judge him for every action of his. it is <br />very evident from many of his acts.</p>
<p>so as historians lets keep this debate impersonal. the more personal <br />we get we deter new opinions as well as run the risk of the heated <br />thread being discontinued by the moderators.</p>

<p>    I am sorry Sampath, that is a very ungrateful thing to say for <br />someone<br />  who gave his life towards a bigger cause and perhaps the only human<br />  being who never held an office and yet had his funeral attended by<br />  dignitaries the world over. Gandhi's impact was not just the freedom<br />  struggle it is world over, the principle of non violence and passive<br />  resistance is too valuable to be throw under the foot as nothing.</p>
<p>    I dont' have any problem discussing Gandhi but we do so with <br />respect -<br />  say I don't understand this and that of what he did. Fine. But to <br />say we<br />  could have done it without him is downright ungrateful and <br />simplistic.<br />  Simply because you cannot rewrite history to see what it would have <br />been<br />  without any major figure.We could have had software without Bill <br />Gates<br />  (poor poor Steve Jobs), we could have had someone else invent <br />theory of<br />  relativity if Einstein did not (because Einsteins personal life <br />sucked<br />  you know so toss him aside as well), we could have had tamil cinema<br />  without Sivaji and MGR (oh well you they dominated and suppressed so<br />  many others so who cares)..where do we stop with this?</p>
<p>    Also dont know which part of the world you live in but to most <br />people<br />  foreigners India is still Gandhi and Gandhi is India. It would be <br />best<br />  to discuss with respect, and not trivialise what he did even if you <br />do<br />  not agree.</p>

<p>Hi <br />I agree. true. gandhi evokes different emotions from different people <br />ranging from reverence to highly critical.</p>
<p>i am sure Gandhi himself was a person with a keen sense of history <br />and knew the future would judge him for every action of his. it is <br />very evident from many of his acts.</p>
<p>so as historians lets keep this debate impersonal. the more personal <br />we get we deter new opinions as well as run the risk of the heated <br />thread being discontinued by the moderators.</p>

<p>    I am sorry Sampath, that is a very ungrateful thing to say for <br />someone<br />  who gave his life towards a bigger cause and perhaps the only human<br />  being who never held an office and yet had his funeral attended by<br />  dignitaries the world over. Gandhi's impact was not just the freedom<br />  struggle it is world over, the principle of non violence and passive<br />  resistance is too valuable to be throw under the foot as nothing.</p>
<p>    I dont' have any problem discussing Gandhi but we do so with <br />respect -<br />  say I don't understand this and that of what he did. Fine. But to <br />say we<br />  could have done it without him is downright ungrateful and <br />simplistic.<br />  Simply because you cannot rewrite history to see what it would have <br />been<br />  without any major figure.We could have had software without Bill <br />Gates<br />  (poor poor Steve Jobs), we could have had someone else invent <br />theory of<br />  relativity if Einstein did not (because Einsteins personal life <br />sucked<br />  you know so toss him aside as well), we could have had tamil cinema<br />  without Sivaji and MGR (oh well you they dominated and suppressed so<br />  many others so who cares)..where do we stop with this?</p>
<p>    Also dont know which part of the world you live in but to most <br />people<br />  foreigners India is still Gandhi and Gandhi is India. It would be <br />best<br />  to discuss with respect, and not trivialise what he did even if you <br />do<br />  not agree.</p>

        <p>Yes Sampath, i completely agree with what Malathi's views are. It <br />would never have been possible to get freedom without Gandhi. To  <br />my knowledge Britishers were very versatile in doing Divide and <br />Rule. The mandatory quality to break it was a disciplined and <br />selfless person to bring mass together with the aligned motto.  <br />Only Gandhi was able to do it. Ofcourse there were extremist <br />factions who tried the best, which everytime backfired as Britishers <br />had more advanced arms than the factions had.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Britishers were dumb and helpless in front of Ahimsa <br />were they had no arms up against and had to abide by our rules.  <br />Only because of Gandhi we were able to make it.</p>
<p>As malathi rightly said, let us not go into Pros and Cons of Gandhi, <br />but accept the reality.</p>
<p>He infact gave a very true definition to what heights a human can go <br />by selfless service and still give the universal meaning to his <br />actions, instead of leaving the meaning to individual's <br />interpretation.</p>
<p>P.S: ONE MORE SMALL REQUEST, A FEW DAYS BACK I HAD REQUESTED THE <br />GROUP TO HELP ME WITH THE LINK TO DOWNLOAD KALKI's PARTHIBAN KANAVU, <br />AS BEING A DIE HARD FAN WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT MOVIE. WILL <br />SOMEBODY PLEASE.</p>

        <p>There are many forums where pro and anti Gandhi groups exchange<br />passionate postings. This is not the place for such discussions.</p>
<p>One thing can be said: India would have got the freedom without Gandhi; both internal and external environments were favourable for India's<br />freedom from foreign yoke.</p>
<p>But without <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , the big temple would not have been built.</p>

        <p>Lol Satish, ennappa neenga, ellaam correcta sollittu do you have to end with another kamal blooper? Oscars *do* have a foreign film category and many films do qualify. The indian films nominated were mother india, lagaan and water. Water was made in Canada though, not strictly an indian nomination. <br />?<br />?I have seen many *dumb* east european and chinese movies win oscars!! Some are really good too like 'wonderful life' the italian movie a few years ago that was widely televised. In fact there were even reviews in AV and magazines that Kamal would have played the lead better than the italian actor!<br />?<br />Anyway, completely outside the subject. Right on with Gandhi.<br />?</p>

<p>Good that everyone are in same line of thought. Though some actions of<br />Gandhi backfired, it takes super human effort to make such decisions<br />and gandhi alone could do it. No one can match gandhi...</p>
<p>During my college days, when I read 'Freedom at Midnight' and was<br />lamenting about Gandhi and his greatness, people around me started<br />teasing me by name 'pseudo gandhi' for fun.

<p>If someone is saying that gandhi should be awarded a Noble prize, I<br />would say they have not understood his values. As most of the group<br />members say, he deserves more than that.

        <p>Sampath, Gandhi was not a good politician, it is a fact admitted to by several people including his grandson. Saints or in other words very principledpeople do not make good politicians. There are many tibetans who feel thatway about the Dalai Lama now.<br />?<br />He grossly misjudged Jinnah and tried to over compromise. Granted. As far as overshadowing other freedom fighters I think that is silly and happens everywhere.<br />?<br />?Public opinion and credit always goes with what is prominent, unless youcan prove someone did something intentionaly to keep others down (like MGRdid in movies). <br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Yes. He has also overshadowed contribution from many freedom fighters; and his adamence is responsible for many of today's ills especially -<br />communal politics.

<p>    Hi,</p>
<p>    my view is Gandhi's life is almost equal to one studying Bhagavad<br />    Gita or Thirukurral.</p>
<p>    As far as i see he is a true example of Karma Yogi, who did his duty<br />    without any expectation on fruits (that too in politics!!!!).</p>
<p>    As Malathi rightly said, he is fit for whatever the universe<br />    offers...</p>
<p>    He is a referral point for anyone to scale on what honesty/integrity<br />    they are leading their lives and is their actions anywhere nearby to<br />    it.</p>

<p>        Venkat, I agree with you on the last point - that Alfred Nobel<br />      being on the commitee would have changed things. I am not sure at<br />    all<br />      about other issues. Whom do we learn about Gandhi from - a racist<br />      bigot like Churchill or hypocrite/religious fundamentalist like<br />      Jinnah? Surely one has to qualify even to comment on Gandhi.</p>
<p>      surely Malathi</p>
<p>      the point was that gandhi was a politician with lofty personal<br />      purity. that irked most.<br />      and his non violent methods did prove effective against the<br />    british<br />      well. to rephrase your words 'he chose his weapons wisely.'</p>
<p>      whereas mandela or aung san suyki gets a nobel for fighting for<br />      freedom in gandhian methods i guess it was a bit too early for the<br />      world not to see him as 'only a' freedom fighter.<br />      venketesh</p>
<p>        Whatever we like or do not like about Gandhi, nobody can really<br />      question his integrity or purity of intent, or putting it<br />    differently<br />      perhaps - nobody came close to that degree of integrity as<br />    Einstein<br />      said. In truth Gandhi had no 'enemies' he only opposed in<br />    principle<br />      what they did - he did not oppose the tax on salt per se, he<br />    opposed<br />      the fact that the British held monopoly to selling tax, not<br />    paying<br />      that tax was a criminal offence and tax was available for free,<br />    the<br />      poorest of the poor only eat fish or rice with salt which could<br />    not<br />      be possible if they had to pay for it.</p>
<p>        Gandhi's actions lead to violence and bloodshed, well perhaps.<br />      Perhaps if Gandhi had been a saint like Ramakrishna or Gautama<br />    Buddha<br />      he could have just practised his principles spiritually and there<br />      would have been no bloodshed.

<p>        The point we can award the British for essentialy is their sense<br />    of<br />      fairness which was an important part of why Gandhi's principles<br />      worked against them. Whether Gandhi would be effective against<br />    Hitler<br />      or Bin Laden is questionable, although the deep rooted principle<br />    of<br />      non violence and compassion is essentially something that will<br />      sustain over time and inspire millions, as it still is with Dalai<br />      Lama. Gandhi does not just deserve Nobel prize for that, He<br />    deserves<br />      every credit the universe can possibly provide even several years<br />      after his death.</p>

<p>        Hi</p>
<p>        whereas the common men thro out the world and even in england<br />      viewed<br />        him as a saint the politician who were at the receiving end of<br />    his<br />        ahimsa and nonviolent methods often resented him.<br />        churchill and jinnah though his strategy was a put on show meant<br />    to<br />        discredit the majority who depended on other methods.<br />        in fact in retrospect some of gandhis actions were sure shot<br />        political strategies to show his enemies in extremely bad light.</p>
<p>        he went the extra mile running a show of good ness which<br />    eventually<br />        triumphs over evil<br />        his salt sathyagraha was a typical example. salt had been taxed<br />      from<br />        roman times. but he challenged it for the first time in history.</p>
<p>        'perhaps' the nobel comitee stocked with war weary europeans saw<br />    in<br />        gandhi a shrewd politician rather than an apostle of peace.<br />        perhaps if alfred nobel himself had been on the deciding comitee<br />    of<br />        the prize that was named after him things would have been<br />    different.</p>

The<br />    Assassination<br />        part<br />          - I dont remember, but what I remember is, it was rejected<br />          continuously based on the fact that, many a times his actions<br />    led<br />      to<br />          blood shed in the form of Hindu-muslim riots.

<p>      Hi</p>
<p>      whereas the common men thro out the world and even in england<br />    viewed<br />      him as a saint the politician who were at the receiving end of<br />  his<br />      ahimsa and nonviolent methods often resented him.<br />      churchill and jinnah though his strategy was a put on show meant<br />  to<br />      discredit the majority who depended on other methods.<br />      in fact in retrospect some of gandhis actions were sure shot<br />      political strategies to show his enemies in extremely bad light.</p>
<p>      he went the extra mile running a show of good ness which<br />  eventually<br />      triumphs over evil<br />      his salt sathyagraha was a typical example. salt had been taxed<br />    from<br />      roman times. but he challenged it for the first time in history.</p>
<p>      'perhaps' the nobel comitee stocked with war weary europeans saw<br />  in<br />      gandhi a shrewd politician rather than an apostle of peace.<br />      perhaps if alfred nobel himself had been on the deciding comitee<br />  of<br />      the prize that was named after him things would have been<br />  different.</p>

          Mahatma Gandhi&#039;s assassination denied him Nobel Prize        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>my view is Gandhi's life is almost equal to one studying Bhagavad <br />Gita or Thirukurral.</p>
<p>As far as i see he is a true example of Karma Yogi, who did his duty <br />without any expectation on fruits (that too in politics!!!!).</p>
<p>As Malathi rightly said, he is fit for whatever the universe <br />offers...</p>
<p>He is a referral point for anyone to scale on what honesty/integrity <br />they are leading their lives and is their actions anywhere nearby to <br />it.</p>

          Mahatma Gandhi&#039;s assassination denied him Nobel Prize        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Venkat, I agree with you on the last point - that Alfred Nobel being on thecommitee would have changed things. I am not sure at all about other issues. Whom do we learn about Gandhi from - a racist bigot like Churchill or?hypocrite/religious fundamentalist like Jinnah? Surely one has to qualify even to comment on Gandhi. <br />?<br />Whatever we like or do not like about Gandhi, nobody can really question his integrity or purity of intent, or putting it differently perhaps - nobodycame close to that degree of integrity as Einstein said. In truth Gandhi had no 'enemies' he only opposed in principle what they did - he did not oppose the tax on salt per se, he opposed the fact that the British held monopoly to selling tax,? not paying that tax was a criminal offence and tax was available for free, the poorest of the poor only eat fish or rice with salt which could not be possible if they had to pay for it.<br />?<br />Gandhi's actions lead to violence and bloodshed, well perhaps. Perhaps if Gandhi had been a saint like Ramakrishna or Gautama Buddha he could have just practised his principles spiritually and there would have been no bloodshed. But then there would have been no Martin Luther Kings or Mandelas either. <br />?<br />The point we can award the British for essentialy is their sense of fairness which was an important part of why Gandhi's principles worked against them. Whether Gandhi would be effective against Hitler or Bin Laden is questionable, although the deep rooted principle of non violence and compassion isessentially something that will sustain over time and inspire millions, asit still is with Dalai Lama. Gandhi does not just deserve Nobel prize for that, He deserves every credit the universe can possibly provide even several years after his death.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>
