<p>(An experience of searching the answer for an important question, &#145;Did India have an education system of her own, if so, how effective was it comparable to the one we have today?&#146;)</p>
<p>Background:<br />The whole life is a celebration with all its various colorful dimensions and with the core truth, which lies as the foundational reality of all its dimensions. Vedas, which exist for time immemorial, are the original sciences to demystify the life. Ramayana is the literature, which reflects the Vedic values in day-to-day life. Web of Life Makers (Webolim) is an organization, which facilitates people to experience the treasured esoteric values of Vedas and Ramayana and inculcate them in their everyday life. It conducts regular workshops, classes, camps, lectures and demonstrations on Vedas and Ramayana around the country and abroad to elucidate the public on various topics of interest, thereby providing simple yet clear solutions that are always integrated to the &#145;Fundamental Reality&#146;.<br />It has conducted lectures / workshops on Vedas &amp; Ramayana in Hyderabad (29th Feb 05), Karimnagar (July 10th), Bangalore, Mysore, Madurai, Singapore and Chennai. (July 25th.) These workshops had participants from various cities like Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Chennai, Cochin, Trivandrum and Bangalore. On continuing this endeavor, this workshop was conducted in Madurai in South Tamil Nadu from 18th November 2006 to 19th November 2006<br />Venue:<br />Agrini Premises,<br />Tirupparankundram Road,<br />Andalpuram, Madurai &#150; 625003.<br />Inaugural Address &#150; Shri Mohanji &#150; 9.00 to 9.15 pm 17/11/06<br />The workshop started with lighting up the lamp and the inaugural address by Sri Mohanji and Sri Ranganji. Both of them in inaugural address emphasized upon the Vedic education and described how the Vedic education can solve most of the problems in India. </p>
<p>Asanas , Pranayama and Meditation by Shri. Mohanji &#150; 5.00 to 6.00 am 18/11/06<br />Sri Mohanji conducted the classes of Asanas, pranayama and meditation. It was totally a different experience which Sri Mohanji brought. Asanas and Pranayamas conducted by Sri Mohanji did not appear to be mere physical and breathing exercises. Participants experienced the deep layers of silence while Sri Mohanji took Asanas and Pranayamas. It was a beautiful fusion of exercises, Mudras and meditation with Omkara chanting. <br />Vedic Chanting with Meaning &#150; 7.00 to 8.30 am 18/11/06<br />As is the custom, various Vedic mantras were chanted and their meanings explained. This time the mantras were related to almost all the walks of a practical life.</p>
<p>Introduction to Vedas &#150; Smt. Dhrushya Rangan &#150; 9.00 to 11.00 am 18/11/06<br />Smt. Dhrushya Rangan dealt with the structure by detailing on the Systematic Arrangement of the Vedas, Uniqueness of Vedas and &#147;Why Vedas?&#148; This was followed by a question &amp; answer session. <br />Happiness analysis by Shri. Mohanji&#150; 11.00 am to 1.00 pm 18/11/06<br />Every body was enthralled by Sri Mohanji&#146;s lecture on Happiness analysis. This lecture was engaging with lot of anecdotes from practical and real life. First he made the audience to understand that the happiness is not from the external objects that we consume. It is not the external object, which has happiness in it. But it is an internal experience to which one is thrown for a fraction of second when one cognizes some external object. This experience is essentially silence. The main idea conveyed is that a spiritual man is he who has the capability to stay in that experience of silence without the help of any external object. There was a session of question and answer after the lecture. </p>
<p>Panel Discussion on Comparison of Indian Education Systems of Today, Yesterday and Tomorrow &#150; Shri. Ranganji and Shri. Mohanji &#150; 3.00 to 4.30 pm 18/11/06</p>
<p>The present day lifestyle with all its unheard stress factors is producing an imbecile mass of humans in India. This needs a rapid change; and this change must come from a very young age. Hence &#145;catch those young and train them right!&#146; This indeed is the need of the hour! This was the message in brief given by the panelists. Now, let&#146;s delve into the discussion points.<br />One must understand that real education is not mere transfer of information. Real education is man-making and nation-building and the tool with which this can be achieved is Yoga. Lust and greed are the two main reasons for the present day problems in education, evident from the amount of child abuse that is happening today. Shri. Mohanji explained the sense of urgency that is needed today to take a good deep look into the perilous education system prevalent in present India with a metaphorical anecdote. It was indeed poignant to see the society wearing a forlorn look, having pushed the Spiritual needs behind Materialistic and bodily pleasures.<br />Quotes like &#147;We have appointments with all but not with our own selves&#148; and &#147;Ounce of practice is better than tones of teachings&#148; enkindled the spirits of an attentive audience. The Indian education system of the past was always aligned towards the Fundamental Reality as it was linked to inner centre. The perfected disciples were taught the Art and Science of attuning their activities to silence. This, according to Shri.Krishna is yoga. Needless to say that the students learnt this technique from their exemplary masters; Further, the panelists went on to show how ancient India was famous for its hospitality and other virtues which are almost at their &#145;moribund stages&#146; now. They were crystal clear in showcasing that a mentality of contempt [Minimum for mine and the Rest for others providing internal Happiness] is the root for these virtues and how badly that is missed today.<br />Shri. Mohanji echoed Swami Vivekananda&#146;s words, &#147;New India will come from Hills and Tribes&#148; and said, It is interesting to note that the so called tribes of today are educated but are illiterate but the so called educated are literate but not educated. <br />Beginning with Children, Youth, Retired but not tired, and by participating in organizations like WEBOLIM [through these awareness spreading camps] should be the immediate remedial step to reverse the present dismal trend and a stepping stone towards glory was the univocal suggestion given by the panelists when asked about the way to change the existing educational scenario towards betterment.<br />One could see/visualize a New Indian Society, hearing about its profound past, reposing a garish, new found faith in it and more importantly, willing to experiment with its old roots.<br />Concept of Education in Upanishads, Smrithis and the Epics by Shri. Ranganji &#150; 4.30 to 5.45 pm 18/11/06</p>
<p>This lecture by Shri. Ranganji can be remembered for its immaculate structure. The speaker took it step by step, detailed the points one by one and presented the concepts in a lucid way that was easier to grasp. The lecture was equally laid out into three distinct parts with Education in Upanishads taking the lead followed by the concept of Education in Smrithis and the Epics.<br />(a) Concept of Education in Upanishads:<br />Education, in the Upanishads appears as a system of conversation between the Guru [Master] and his/her Shishya [Disciple]. Various examples from the Chandogya and the Brihadhaaranyaka were cited. Significance of women education was made evident from the innumerable examples of women conversing with sages, kings, shishyas and divinities. In the Vedic literature, education was imparted from the Seer masters to the disciples through two main forms namely, [i] Vidhi-Vaakya [method of education consisting injunctions and prohibitions of do&#146;s and don&#146;ts that were stated for becoming virtuous] and [ii] Bhootavastuvishaya [method of education, revealing the SAT in other words, presenting the IS to the disciple to see on his own, for being virtuous].</p>
<p>Though the former was easier to comprehend for the normal man, Upanishads insisted the importance of the latter as it was based on personal, direct experience which was beyond any doubt. Apart from these, the lecture stressed the importance of Tapasya and Mantra japa (inter related) and showed how mantras and their dhyana cleansed the mind and calmed the inner space. This, according to the lecturer, is badly missed in the present education scenario, causing many a problem.<br />(b) Concept of Education in Smrithis:<br />The speaker clearly showed how education and the educated wereesteemed highly at the time of the Smrithis. He explained that Education was considered as an obligation in the society and those who were not educated were considered as committing crimes. Today&#146;s education system has a strong connection with money. The speaker explained how the Smrithis conceived and practiced an educational system which was free of money [the Guru-Griha vasa system]. It was exhilarating to hear that the society took the responsibility of educating everyone by offering alms to the Brhamachaarys&#146;, sanyasis and the unchavratis. Begging for food [which cultivated the ideas of humility and independence of money] was followed in relation to one&#146;s life style. The Guru was considered as a noble soul parting Vidhya-Dhana to his/her students&#146; void of any discrimination [compare with today&#146;s lot of money minded teachers!!!]. The concept of &#145;Guru-Dhakshina&#146; was clarified as willful donation given<br />by earning students to their Guru as a token of their gratitude towards the master and was not paid out as a fees for educating them, as generally misconceived by many today.<br />It was interesting to note that [no wonder though!!!], that all the curriculums teaching various disciplines like Dhanur-veda [archery], Shilpa-shaastra [architecture], Ganitha-shaastra [mathematics], Artha-shaastra [economics, finance and management], Naatya [dance] etc&#133;. had one thing in common &#150; They all taught Vedas !<br />(c) Concept of Education in Epics:</p>
<p>Here the speaker elucidated the other dimension of the Guru as the <br />as the care taker of his/her disciple. He gave points from the Ramayana, showing the great sage Vishvaamitra caressing Rama, his disciple. Vishvaamitra narrating innumerable stories to Rama, patiently answering his questions was a sight to behold. The Guru as a care taker went up to the extent of helping Rama find his &#145;matchless match&#146; Sita. This role of the Guru and his/her relationship with the disciple was dealt in the lecture. Also glimpses of Vyasa&#146;s and Dhrona&#146;s gurukulas were highlighted and their pros and cons were told.<br />With a twist of phrases, Shri. Ranganji, warmed up the audience, entertained, delighted, amused and held them spell bound throughout his lecture.</p>
<p>Life Craft &#150; 4.30 to 5.30 pm 18/11/06</p>
<p>Following its broad success in the Chennai camp, a session of Life craft <br />was conducted where many participants shared their feelings, associating them with the great epics and the Vedas. The session provided a needed breather for the audience, who were otherwise, much engrossed in the remainder of the camp. The day closed in an enchanting note.</p>
<p>Yoga, Asanas, Pranayama and Meditation by Shri. Mohanji &#150; 5.00 to 6.00 am 19/11/06</p>
<p>Shri. Mohanji started the day with his own unique style, with yoga, pranayama and mediation practice to calm down the mind. It must be stressed that this session was of great help for the audience so that they faced a tight day ahead with gushing enthusiasm. One could visualize the sight of shishyas sitting around a calm guru in a serene morning duly taking their classes to perfect the art of &#145;looking inside&#146;!<br />Vedic Chanting with Meaning &#150; 7.00 to 8.30 am 19/11/06<br />As is the custom, various Vedic mantras were chanted today too and their meanings explained. </p>
<p>Concept of Education in Vedas by Shri. Ranganji &#150; 9.30 am to 1.00 pm 19/11/06</p>
<p>One must not miss the opportunity of hearing about the Vedas and its myriad forms from Shri. Ranganji. He makes it look so easy and so lucid that our normal drumming lives stop for a moment! We were taken for a cool, healthy swim across a lovely stream of nature, a stream so deep and wild, yet so serene, a stream where he makes us afloat nonchalantly - the stream of the Divine Silence!<br />Come Vedas, come Shri. Ranganji and there happens a magical fusion! This time the fusion was through pleasant music and dance interspersed betwixt Vedic sermons. The result, the listening audience witnessed a transient taste of holy nectar in the deepest depths of their souls. The dance was performed by Kum.Radha in between the lectures to make the concepts dealt in the lecture to enter in to the heart. &#147;Whatever cannot reach the head through the language of mine in my lecture can reach the heart through the bhavas and mudras of Kum. Radha&#146;s dance&#148; said the speaker. The speaker swiftly moved through the etymological roots of the Vedas at the start and talked about the importance of education to all in the Vedic society, significance of women&#146;s share in education etc&#133; and started to explain the various facets of Guru-Shishya relationship as seen in the Vedas.<br />Be it the &#145;Parental&#146; facet where the parents are his Son&#146;s guru [Udhalatha &#150; Swetaketu], or the &#145;Friendly&#146; facet where a Friend happens to be his mate&#146;s guru [Arjuna &#150; Krsna] or the &#145;Divine God Head&#146; facet where one deity is the guru for a human [Yama &#150; Nachiketas], the guru-shishya relationship is a complex and a sacred one.<br />A Guru is a perfected human bestowed with the following qualities; Knower of Consciousness, Sweet to move with, having a Friendly approach and is a follower of wisdom found everywhere. The Shishya, on his part was required to be noble either through the unflinching practice of celibacy [according to Prajaapati, the guru of the divine, immortals transcend death through the austere practice of Brahmachcharya] and duly serving the guru&#146;s day to day needs. It was said that the Gurus&#146; were happy with their shishyas who were found meditating on their sermons through their power of concentration attained by the practice of celibacy.<br />The Guru initiates his/her disciples into Sadhana, the conquer of death, through various vidhyas [education] and by maintaining intimate relationships where the gurus and their shishyas&#146; learnt together, performed together and were together! Everything that is seen, heard, smelt and felt was therefore revered as a Guru and had a point or two to offer. The lecture ended peacefully highlighting the values of those golden days. <br />Wordsworth shouting, &#147;One impulse from a vernal wood may<br />teach you more of man of moral evil and of good than all the sages can&#148; could be heard, reverberating in one&#146;s mind!</p>
<p>Life Craft &#150; 3.00 to 4.00 pm 19/11/06<br />Another Life craft session and the audience poured in their experiences with lots of vividness. Some sang songs, some spoke &#150; it was a mixture of enjoyment and relaxation after a good meal.</p>
<p>A beautiful tree by Sri Pramod &#150; 4.30 am to 6.00 pm 19/11/06<br />Sri Pramod captivated the audience with his distinguished talk which was deep and simple. The epitome of his talk is given below. </p>
<p>While Gandhiji proclaimed that the education in India before the British rule was better than the education brought by the British, somebody asked him to prove his proclamation through statistical data. This inspired the great Dharampal who was the sincere follower of Gandhiji. <br />Sri Dharampal dedicated his life for this task and spent his precious time in various ancient libraries of Europe where the statistical records about the ancient Indian educational system (documented by the ancient British government) are available. <br />As a result of this he came with his great writings like &#147;Beautiful tree&#148; which deciphers the ancient educational system of India in a systematic way. <br />Sri Pramod summed up the whole book of &#147;Beautiful tree&#148; in his lecture which included various statistical data about the number of schools, students and teachers existing in ancient Bengal (east India), Madras (south India) and Bombay (west India). Through this statistical data it can be proven that the schools and the students studying in the schools were more in ancient India than the modern one. <br />The speaker showed how the British government systematically discouraged these traditional schools to develop their own Macaulate schools which can develop only slaves in India. <br />The statistical data also clearly shows that the people belonging to all castes were going to schools in ancient India. This eliminates the misconception that Brahmins alone were educated in ancient India. The speaker said that it was the British government which deliberately brought the reservation policy for Brahmins in the educational system to make them to give up their own Vedic education. British government maintaining its nature of divide and rule policy made a sharp difference between Brahmins and other castes by offering reservations to Brahmins in its educational systems and occupations. <br />The data also remove the misconception that the secular education was very less in ancient India. The data clearly show the ancient curriculum which includes Ayurveda, Vaisheshika and Arthashastra etc. <br />The speaker also talked about another data which is going to get published in January. This data show how most of the students and teachers of modern education are not interested with their existing curriculum. <br />The speaker emphasized the man making education. Unless the people of India do not know the past of India the nation cannot grow. The real history of India should be taught to the students of the modern school. <br />Conclusion<br />With the singing of Slokas of Ramarajya from Ramayana the workshop got concluded. The Enrapture was finally over. All that the participants carried back was their delightful memories and a thirst for acquiring more and more of this opulent experience. </p>
