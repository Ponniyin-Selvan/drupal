<p>Yeah... missed to mention. thanks Katherine.</p>
<p>This PURI subject is really making me read more on Krishna ..</p>
<p>though I am yet to find direct answer relating his last days to Puri - certain aspects of Dwaraka / Mahabaratha are very very interesting ::</p>

<p>" This Garuda-column of Vasudeva (Visnu), the god of gods, was erected hereby Heliodorus, a worshipper of Vishnu, the son of Dion, and an inhabitant of Taxila, who came as Greek ambassador from the Great King Antialkidas to King Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, the Savior, then reigning prosperously in the fourteenth year of his kingship."</p>

<p>1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely liked with Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with Ajapati, descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N. Oaks equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of Ramesis, with the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks identifies the Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was an ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic trait of words which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the letter p is often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the word sing corrupted itself into king. </p>
<p>2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks presents a picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes and practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind which the Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies the man as a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was originally produced inthe book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as well as in the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces another picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of Memphis. The pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.  </p>
<p>Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the pyramids in Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where do they go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous references to opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, and the tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to Shambala/Shangri La, a Vedic city in the hollow earth. </p>

They destroyed the civilizations of Sindh and?it saying that they took long time and hardly demolished the Sindh people thosewho lived in the banks of River Sindh. It is hard to me now to get the book from my home.

<p>Writer "Nandhala " an ardent fan of Shree Krishna answers this::</p>
<p>Qn: In shreemadhbagavadham - dasma (10th) skantham - relates to Rasakrita /Gopika adventures etc. Why Sree Sukhabrahmam did not mention of Radha evenonce ?</p>
<p>She ( Nandhala) replies ::</p>
<p>1. RADHA was the GURU of Sukhabrahmam.. when he was in the form of a parrot. Tht Parrot used to chant Radha Radha.. frequently... So Radha advised theparrot to chant Shree Krishna Shree Krishna...</p>
<p>2. The moment Sukha mentions RADHA he goes into Nishta (forgets his-state totally. So in order to complete Upadesam to King Parikshith within 7 days - he consciously avoided the mention of Radha.</p>
<p>3. Brahma uvasa - sanathkumar uvasa .. is how others are mentioned. But Shree Sukha uvasa is HOW he is mentioned. Here Shree means RADHA too. Only Lord Krishna is known as Shree Krishna and Sukha sage is known as SHREE SUKHA BRAHMAM !</p>

<p>    Great Discussion indeed !</p>
<p>    A query. Assuming Radha was created at later ages by Jayadeva, Why would<br />    Jayadeva create a character that is married and create an adulterous<br />    relationship? It is not logical for an author to create an uncomplicated<br />    character and link with Krishna? I guess an adulterous relationship<br />    would have been a no-no even at that times. Would it not have been easy<br />    and quite acceptable to create an girl character who is unmarried and of<br />    the same age as Krishna and spin a love story ?? Any probable reasons ??</p>

        <p>Great Discussion indeed !</p>
<p>A query. Assuming Radha was created at later ages by Jayadeva, Why would<br />Jayadeva create a character that is married and create an adulterous<br />relationship? It is not logical for an author to create an uncomplicated<br />character and link with Krishna? I guess an adulterous relationship<br />would have been a no-no even at that times. Would it not have been easy<br />and quite acceptable to create an girl character who is unmarried and of<br />the same age as Krishna and spin a love story ?? Any probable reasons ??</p>

<p>Very interesting discussion.</p>
<p>There is a theory (I read somewhere on the web) that there was never a<br />character called Radha originally. She was a creation of Jayadeva who<br />wanted a foil for Krishna in his romantic ashtapadis. </p>
<p>Radha is not mentioned anywhere in Mahabharatha, Srimad Bhagavatham or<br />Vishnu puranam or any of the pasurams! There is no mention of any<br />"special" gopi in these works, but Jayadeva used some suggestions of a<br />favorite gopi to create Radha and make her the embodiment of Krishna<br />bhakthi.</p>
<p>This creation was later adopted by many poets in Bengal, Chaitanya, etc,<br />and soon there was no separating Radha from Krishna!</p>
<p>Its curious why south india did not adopt Radha as enthusiastically. Was<br />it her married state and hence her adulterous relationship with Krishna<br />that south did not accept? You don't see Radha in temples, etc. The only<br />time you hear of Radha is in the bhajan sampradayams where they perform<br />Radha kalyanam. Interesting!</p>

<p>Draupadi was not born by human birth she was born out of fire. There is nothing in the Mahabharat that says she was 'attracted' to Sri Krishna and sheis regarded as his sister, not just by color but by divinity in origin.</p>
<p>It is a very tough task to read mythology with acknowledging some spiritualconnection. Myth is on the fine line between human stories and spiritual super human connections - and that is an extremely difficult line to walk. We usually have two parties, one who want to toally humanise everything suchas in puranic movies like Karnan where Karna's story is reduced to one of an abandoned kid in 20th century, or we have the whole reengineering spiritual crowd that reverse engineers the whole story as divine ordain and takesout all the humanness out of it. It is a fine line between both and often times one that can only make sense to an individual as they see it.</p>

        <p>Draupadi was not born by human birth she was born out of fire. There is nothing in the Mahabharat that says she was 'attracted' to Sri Krishna and sheis regarded as his sister, not just by color but by divinity in origin.</p>
<p>It is a very tough task to read mythology with acknowledging some spiritualconnection. Myth is on the fine line between human stories and spiritual super human connections - and that is an extremely difficult line to walk. We usually have two parties, one who want to toally humanise everything suchas in puranic movies like Karnan where Karna's story is reduced to one of an abandoned kid in 20th century, or we have the whole reengineering spiritual crowd that reverse engineers the whole story as divine ordain and takesout all the humanness out of it. It is a fine line between both and often times one that can only make sense to an individual as they see it.<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@...  wrote:</p>

        <p>Dear Dhivakar, it is very debatable if Nappinnai was Radha, since tamil folklore and tradition celebrate her 'marraige' to Sri Krishna. Nappinnai has sometimes been argued to be Neela Devi, the south indian princess Sri Krishna married after subduing 8 bulls.</p>
<p>There is no Radha in the Bhagavatam or Mahabharat. Radha was intrduced during the Bhakti movement and predominantly in the north. Jayadeva does not make any bones about thinking of her as Sri Krishna's mistress, a woman who taught him the secrets of love. He even goes far to describe how Sri Krishnacreated 'maya' around Radha's husband and friends and made them invisible when they came looking for her and the lovers were together. </p>
<p>One has to have a fairly liberal concept of love to accept Radha as what itis,assumign she existed. The over exaltation of the Radha concept in the north and more by ISKCON (who actually turned her into Rukmini and obliterated the origins of everything into their own culture) has blurred the imaginative origins almost completely. Most of our saints did not want to do so and they probably coined Nappinnai to mean a married wife he had.</p>

<p>  Actually the whole RAdha story is somewhat controversial which is one of the reasons probably why Radha is not worshipped as much as Rukmini(atleastin southerin india). Radha was a married woman and older to Sri Krishna. </p>
<p>  I am very surprised at the Draupadi wanting to marry Sri Krishna, Draupadi is technically Sri Krishna's sister, blue in complexion and her other name is Krishnaaa too. I have to verify if this is there in the Ganguli Mahabharat Translation.</p>

<p>    oh! my favourite author..<br />    ?<br />    Yes. Krishna series books, enough to know about the whole mahabharatam and also bhagavatham. The book for children, youth and elders.<br />    ?<br />    Part 1 - How Krishna was born with four shoulders and taken?by Vasudeva, Krishna's Gokulam and His playful tactics of killing Putaki and frightening Kalinga snake at yamuna river, his subsequent love towards Radha and his voyage to Mathura and atlast killing his own uncle? Kamsa.? Here, onRadha's love towards Krishna,??KMM mentioned that he has taken the Radha Story after verification from Elango's silappathikaaram, where Radha wascalled as Nappinnai.<br />    ?<br />    (For those who want to read in Tamil (first part), GITA SAMBASIVAM, writes in her blog. I wll find out the blog address and put it here)<br />    ?<br />    Part 2: How Krishna rejected the offer of King at Madhura by Ugrasena and meeting first time with Pandava Brothers at Mathura, and smart love story of Rukmini and excellent war methods of Jarasandh to capture Krishna brothers, who escape to Goa, then defeated Jarasandha?in a war and dejected Jarasandha plan for grand alliance against Krishna and asked Rukmi, brother of Rukmini to prepare a fake swaymvar for tghe benefit of Sisubala, finallyskuttled by SriKrishna <br />    ?<br />    Here, KM Munshi narrating in suberb way about the love affairs of Shaibya and Rukmini with Krishna, and finally how Rukmini realise Krishna is meant for others and not only for her own self. Excellent part.<br />    ?<br />    The most thrilling series is Part-3, Five Brothers, the complete story of early Pandavas, Krishna's association with them and how Krishna plans their escape route, how the cousin of Krishna Uddhava fails to learn of love with Naga beauties, and finally the real swayamvaram arranged by Krishna himself for Drowpathi and how he thwarted the efforts of Jarasandha to take away the bride violently and atlast how Drowbathi accepts all five as her husbands. This is important and a justifiable theory was found by KM Munshi for this particular aspect where actually Krishna tells every one in the whole series He is for establishing dharma in the earth. VERY CLEVERLY HANDLED.<br />    ?<br />    In fact, Drowbathi (Krishnaa)?first opted for Sri Krishna as her Husband, but the clever Krishna avoided her and saying that she is suitable to more worthy person who can oppose their enemy, i.e. Dronacharya. The Love became friendliness and finally as saviour of her prestige too in various encounter of hers in future. Not only Drowbathi, Krishna gives equal importance to Bhanumathi (Dhuriyodhana' s wife)?here in this story. well handled by KMM.<br />    ?<br />    The fourth part, fifth part and sixth part (Bhima, Yudhirstra and VedhaVyasa) all are told in very well narrated style. How Trivedham became chathurvedham is well explained in Vedha Vyasa Book. <br />    ?<br />    I always purchase and?present the Krishna series stories set to important people whenever I attend on them. The books are available in all majorstores everywhere apart from BVB stalls. Very less priced. But worth is priceless.<br />    ?<br />    I suggest strongly our PS group members also. You do not find any sort of dullness and you are assured of briskness?while reading the book, eventhough you are well aware the end as well the happenings. That is KMM., the Great and guide for any writer.<br />    ?<br />    Dhivakar<br />    ?</p>

<p>    He even has a wonderful way of dealing with Radha and Krishna. He doesn't mince words. Radha and Krishna were lovers and very much in love. But when Krishna's image starts expanding and he starts growing past Vrindavan, he implores Radha to go with him.. but Radha refuses and tells him: Here youwill always be my Kanhaiyya.. outside you won't. I would rather live here with your memories rather than become one among many who love you etc.?</p>
<p>    In later books he shows Krishna as remembering Radha with a lot of love.?</p>
<p>    It's a treasure I tell you.</p>

<p>      Malathy,<br />      That is not quite an original thought. I would recommend that you read<br />      Krishnavatara by KM Munshi. Wonderfully written. He makes Krishna a human<br />      albeit with wonderful qualities and the interplay between Krishna andthe<br />      Pandavas is awesome. He makes Bhima into this jovial giant who keeps playing<br />      pranks on all. Also, all the "miracles" such as the raising of Mount<br />      Govardhan etc are explained very rationally and scientifically.<br />      Unfortunately, Munshiji died before he could complete it but the 7 volume<br />      set is still a treasure. I think Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan are the publishers.</p>

<p>        Thanks Arun. Actually I was impressed by what the author said on Krishna<br />        not being the stereotyped version of the playful machiavellian hero- who is<br />        somewhat of an odd mix of divine and human but more of a warrior, very<br />        intelligent politician who was ahead of his times. It might just behis idea<br />        but noone i think has thought about it that way.</p>

<p>          I have read the "Search for the Historical Krishna" and was not terribly<br />          impressed. The author gives some evidence from astronomy (using<br />        astrological<br />          charts mentioned in the VEdas, etc) to set the year as around 3100 BC for<br />          Krishna. Also some geological evidence for Saraswathi. Then he goes into<br />        a<br />          retelling of the Mahabharatha which is pointless. He makes allusion to<br />          epigraphical evidence in terms of the Indus script, but doesn't really<br />        show<br />          anything.Regards,</p>

<p>            Dear SPS, thank you for the great information links. I very much<br />        enjoyed<br />            reading the extract from 'Search for the historical Krishna' and will<br />        truly<br />            wait for the book to be published.</p>
<p>            Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic'city it<br />        is<br />            regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been<br />        many<br />            places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />            Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest<br />        gorge<br />            and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has it<br />        that<br />            people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic has<br />        had<br />            many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the<br />        region<br />            due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it is not<br />            accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>            I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the<br />        Shambala<br />            is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>              1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely liked with<br />            Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with Ajapati,<br />            descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N.. Oaks<br />            equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of Ramesis,<br />        with<br />            the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks identifies<br />        the<br />            Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was an<br />            ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic traitof<br />        words<br />            which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the letter<br />        p is<br />            often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the word<br />        sing<br />            corrupted itself into king.</p>
<p>              2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks<br />        presents a<br />            picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes and<br />            practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind which<br />        the<br />            Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies the<br />        man as<br />            a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was originally<br />            produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as well as<br />        in<br />            the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces<br />        another<br />            picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of Memphis.<br />        The<br />            pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>              Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the pyramids<br />        in<br />            Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where do<br />        they<br />            go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous references to<br />            opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, and the<br />            tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to Shambala/Shangri La,<br />        a<br />            Vedic city in the hollow earth.</p>

<blockquote><p>  oh! my favourite author..<br />  ?<br />  Yes. Krishna series books, enough to know about the whole mahabharatam and also bhagavatham. The book for children, youth and elders.<br />  ?<br />  Part 1 - How Krishna was born with four shoulders and taken?by Vasudeva, Krishna's Gokulam and His playful tactics of killing Putaki and frightening Kalinga snake at yamuna river, his subsequent love towards Radha and hisvoyage to Mathura and atlast killing his own uncle? Kamsa.? Here, on Radha's love towards Krishna,??KMM mentioned that he has taken the RadhaStory after verification from Elango's silappathikaaram, where Radha was called as Nappinnai.<br />  ?<br />  (For those who want to read in Tamil (first part), GITA SAMBASIVAM, writes in her blog. I wll find out the blog address and put it here)<br />  ?<br />  Part 2: How Krishna rejected the offer of King at Madhura by Ugrasena andmeeting first time with Pandava Brothers at Mathura, and smart love story of Rukmini and excellent war methods of Jarasandh to capture Krishna brothers, who escape to Goa, then defeated Jarasandha?in a war and dejected Jarasandha plan for grand alliance against Krishna and asked Rukmi, brother ofRukmini to prepare a fake swaymvar for tghe benefit of Sisubala, finally skuttled by SriKrishna <br />  ?<br />  Here, KM Munshi narrating in suberb way about the love affairs of Shaibyaand Rukmini with Krishna, and finally how Rukmini realise Krishna is meantfor others and not only for her own self. Excellent part.<br />  ?<br />  The most thrilling series is Part-3, Five Brothers, the complete story ofearly Pandavas, Krishna's association with them and how Krishna plans their escape route, how the cousin of Krishna Uddhava fails to learn of love with Naga beauties, and finally the real swayamvaram arranged by Krishna himself for Drowpathi and how he thwarted the efforts of Jarasandha to take away the bride violently and atlast how Drowbathi accepts all five as her husbands. This is important and a justifiable theory was found by KM Munshi forthis particular aspect where actually Krishna tells every one in the wholeseries He is for establishing dharma in the earth. VERY CLEVERLY HANDLED.<br />  ?<br />  In fact, Drowbathi (Krishnaa)?first opted for Sri Krishna as her Husband, but the clever Krishna avoided her and saying that she is suitable to more worthy person who can oppose their enemy, i.e. Dronacharya. The Love became friendliness and finally as saviour of her prestige too in various encounter of hers in future. Not only Drowbathi, Krishna gives equal importanceto Bhanumathi (Dhuriyodhana's wife)?here in this story. well handled by KMM.<br />  ?<br />  The fourth part, fifth part and sixth part (Bhima, Yudhirstra and Vedha Vyasa) all are told in very well narrated style. How Trivedham became chathurvedham is well explained in Vedha Vyasa Book. <br />  ?<br />  I always purchase and?present the Krishna series stories set to important people whenever I attend on them. The books are available in all major stores everywhere apart from BVB stalls. Very less priced. But worth is priceless.<br />  ?<br />  I suggest strongly our PS group members also. You do not find any sort ofdullness and you are assured of briskness?while reading the book, even though you are well aware the end as well the happenings. That is KMM., the Great and guide for any writer.<br />  ?<br />  Dhivakar<br />  ?</p>

<p>  He even has a wonderful way of dealing with Radha and Krishna. He doesn'tmince words. Radha and Krishna were lovers and very much in love. But whenKrishna's image starts expanding and he starts growing past Vrindavan, he implores Radha to go with him.. but Radha refuses and tells him: Here you will always be my Kanhaiyya.. outside you won't. I would rather live here with your memories rather than become one among many who love you etc.?</p>
<p>  In later books he shows Krishna as remembering Radha with a lot of love.?</p>
<p>  It's a treasure I tell you.</p>

<p>    Malathy,<br />    That is not quite an original thought. I would recommend that you read<br />    Krishnavatara by KM Munshi. Wonderfully written. He makes Krishna a human<br />    albeit with wonderful qualities and the interplay between Krishna and the<br />    Pandavas is awesome. He makes Bhima into this jovial giant who keeps playing<br />    pranks on all. Also, all the "miracles" such as the raising of Mount<br />    Govardhan etc are explained very rationally and scientifically.<br />    Unfortunately, Munshiji died before he could complete it but the 7 volume<br />    set is still a treasure. I think Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan are the publishers.</p>

<p>      Thanks Arun. Actually I was impressed by what the author said on Krishna<br />      not being the stereotyped version of the playful machiavellian hero -who is<br />      somewhat of an odd mix of divine and human but more of a warrior, very<br />      intelligent politician who was ahead of his times. It might just be his idea<br />      but noone i think has thought about it that way.</p>

<p>        I have read the "Search for the Historical Krishna" and was not terribly<br />        impressed. The author gives some evidence from astronomy (using<br />      astrological<br />        charts mentioned in the VEdas, etc) to set the year as around 3100 BC for<br />        Krishna. Also some geological evidence for Saraswathi. Then he goesinto<br />      a<br />        retelling of the Mahabharatha which is pointless. He makes allusionto<br />        epigraphical evidence in terms of the Indus script, but doesn't really<br />      show<br />        anything.Regards,</p>

<p>          Dear SPS, thank you for the great information links. I very much<br />      enjoyed<br />          reading the extract from 'Search for the historical Krishna' and will<br />      truly<br />          wait for the book to be published.</p>
<p>          Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic' city it<br />      is<br />          regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been<br />      many<br />          places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />          Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest<br />      gorge<br />          and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has it<br />      that<br />          people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic has<br />      had<br />          many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the<br />      region<br />          due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it isnot<br />          accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>          I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the<br />      Shambala<br />          is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>            " This Garuda-column of Vasudeva (Visnu), the god of gods, was<br />      erected<br />          here by Heliodorus, a worshipper of Vishnu, the son of Dion, and an<br />          inhabitant of Taxila, who came as Greek ambassador from the GreatKing<br />          Antialkidas to King Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, the Savior, then reigning<br />          prosperously in the fourteenth year of his kingship."</p>
<p>            <a href="http://www.hollowor" title="http://www.hollowor">http://www.hollowor</a> bs.com/Pyramids. htm</p>
<p>            1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely likedwith<br />          Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with Ajapati,<br />          descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N. Oaks<br />          equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of Ramesis,<br />      with<br />          the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks identifies<br />      the<br />          Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was an<br />          ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic trait of<br />      words<br />          which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the letter<br />      p is<br />          often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the word<br />      sing<br />          corrupted itself into king.</p>
<p>            2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks<br />      presents a<br />          picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes and<br />          practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind which<br />      the<br />          Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies the<br />      man as<br />          a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was originally<br />          produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as well as<br />      in<br />          the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces<br />      another<br />          picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of Memphis.<br />      The<br />          pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>            Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the pyramids<br />      in<br />          Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where do<br />      they<br />          go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous references to<br />          opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, andthe<br />          tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to Shambala/Shangri La,<br />      a<br />          Vedic city in the hollow earth.</p>

<p>Thanks Arun. Actually I was impressed by what the author said on Krishna not being the stereotyped version of the playful machiavellian hero - who is somewhat of an odd mix of divine and human but more of a warrior, very intelligent politician who was ahead of his times. It might just be his idea but noone i think has thought about it that way.</p>

<blockquote><p>  I have read the "Search for the Historical Krishna" and was not terribly<br />  impressed. The author gives some evidence from astronomy (using astrological<br />  charts mentioned in the VEdas, etc) to set the year as around 3100 BC for<br />  Krishna. Also some geological evidence for Saraswathi. Then he goes into a<br />  retelling of the Mahabharatha which is pointless. He makes allusion to<br />  epigraphical evidence in terms of the Indus script, but doesn't really show<br />  anything.Regards,</p>

<p>    Dear SPS, thank you for the great information links. I very much enjoyed<br />    reading the extract from 'Search for the historical Krishna' and will truly<br />    wait for the book to be published.</p>
<p>    Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic' city itis<br />    regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been many<br />    places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />    Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest gorge<br />    and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has itthat<br />    people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic has had<br />    many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the region<br />    due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it is not<br />    accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>    I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the Shambala<br />    is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>      1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely liked with<br />    Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with Ajapati,<br />    descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N. Oaks<br />    equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of Ramesis, with<br />    the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks identifiesthe<br />    Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was an<br />    ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic trait of words<br />    which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the letterp is<br />    often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the word sing<br />    corrupted itself into king.</p>
<p>      2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks presents a<br />    picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes and<br />    practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind which the<br />    Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies the man as<br />    a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was originally<br />    produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as well as in<br />    the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces another<br />    picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of Memphis.The<br />    pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>      Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the pyramidsin<br />    Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where do they<br />    go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous references to<br />    opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, and the<br />    tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to Shambala/Shangri La,a<br />    Vedic city in the hollow earth.</p>

<p>        I'm puzzled tho re Puri: how could Lord Krishna have<br />        left his body at Puri, when he was hit by an arrow at<br />        Bhalka Tirth outside Dwarka, GUJ?<br />        Just curious. . .<br />        Kathie<br />        ps I have photos from Konark also, if anyone wants them.</p>

        <p>Draupadi and Krishna were not brother and sister. THe name Krishnaa was due<br />to their dark color (not blue please :) let's call it what it was.

<p>Actually the whole RAdha story is somewhat controversial which is one of the reasons probably why Radha is not worshipped as much as Rukmini(atleast in southerin india). Radha was a married woman and older to Sri Krishna. </p>
<p>I am very surprised at the Draupadi wanting to marry Sri Krishna, Draupadi is technically Sri Krishna's sister, blue in complexion and her other name is Krishnaaa too. I have to verify if this is there in the Ganguli Mahabharat Translation.</p>

I wll find out the blog address and put it here)<br />  ?<br />  Part 2: How Krishna rejected the offer of King at Madhura by Ugrasena andmeeting first time with Pandava Brothers at Mathura, and smart love story of Rukmini and excellent war methods of Jarasandh to capture Krishna brothers, who escape to Goa, then defeated Jarasandha?in a war and dejected Jarasandha plan for grand alliance against Krishna and asked Rukmi, brother ofRukmini to prepare a fake swaymvar for tghe benefit of Sisubala, finally skuttled by SriKrishna <br />  ?<br />  Here, KM Munshi narrating in suberb way about the love affairs of Shaibyaand Rukmini with Krishna, and finally how Rukmini realise Krishna is meantfor others and not only for her own self. Excellent part.<br />  ?<br />  The most thrilling series is Part-3, Five Brothers, the complete story ofearly Pandavas, Krishna's association with them and how Krishna plans their escape route, how the cousin of Krishna Uddhava fails to learn of love with Naga beauties, and finally the real swayamvaram arranged by Krishna himself for Drowpathi and how he thwarted the efforts of Jarasandha to take away the bride violently and atlast how Drowbathi accepts all five as her husbands. This is important and a justifiable theory was found by KM Munshi forthis particular aspect where actually Krishna tells every one in the wholeseries He is for establishing dharma in the earth. VERY CLEVERLY HANDLED.<br />  ?<br />  In fact, Drowbathi (Krishnaa)?first opted for Sri Krishna as her Husband, but the clever Krishna avoided her and saying that she is suitable to more worthy person who can oppose their enemy, i.e. Dronacharya.

How Trivedham became chathurvedham is well explained in Vedha Vyasa Book. <br />  ?<br />  I always purchase and?present the Krishna series stories set to important people whenever I attend on them. The books are available in all major stores everywhere apart from BVB stalls. Very less priced. But worth is priceless.<br />  ?<br />  I suggest strongly our PS group members also. You do not find any sort ofdullness and you are assured of briskness?while reading the book, even though you are well aware the end as well the happenings.

<p>  He even has a wonderful way of dealing with Radha and Krishna. He doesn'tmince words. Radha and Krishna were lovers and very much in love. But whenKrishna's image starts expanding and he starts growing past Vrindavan, he implores Radha to go with him.. but Radha refuses and tells him: Here you will always be my Kanhaiyya.. outside you won't. I would rather live here with your memories rather than become one among many who love you etc.?</p>
<p>  In later books he shows Krishna as remembering Radha with a lot of love.?</p>
<p>  It's a treasure I tell you.</p>

<p>    Malathy,<br />    That is not quite an original thought. I would recommend that you read<br />    Krishnavatara by KM Munshi. Wonderfully written. He makes Krishna a human<br />    albeit with wonderful qualities and the interplay between Krishna and the<br />    Pandavas is awesome. He makes Bhima into this jovial giant who keeps playing<br />    pranks on all. Also, all the "miracles" such as the raising of Mount<br />    Govardhan etc are explained very rationally and scientifically.<br />    Unfortunately, Munshiji died before he could complete it but the 7 volume<br />    set is still a treasure. I think Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan are the publishers.</p>

<p>      Thanks Arun. Actually I was impressed by what the author said on Krishna<br />      not being the stereotyped version of the playful machiavellian hero -who is<br />      somewhat of an odd mix of divine and human but more of a warrior, very<br />      intelligent politician who was ahead of his times. It might just be his idea<br />      but noone i think has thought about it that way.</p>

<p>        I have read the "Search for the Historical Krishna" and was not terribly<br />        impressed. The author gives some evidence from astronomy (using<br />      astrological<br />        charts mentioned in the VEdas, etc) to set the year as around 3100 BC for<br />        Krishna. Also some geological evidence for Saraswathi. Then he goesinto<br />      a<br />        retelling of the Mahabharatha which is pointless. He makes allusionto<br />        epigraphical evidence in terms of the Indus script, but doesn't really<br />      show<br />        anything.Regards,</p>

<p>          Dear SPS, thank you for the great information links. I very much<br />      enjoyed<br />          reading the extract from 'Search for the historical Krishna' and will<br />      truly<br />          wait for the book to be published.</p>
<p>          Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic' city it<br />      is<br />          regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been<br />      many<br />          places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />          Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest<br />      gorge<br />          and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has it<br />      that<br />          people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic has<br />      had<br />          many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the<br />      region<br />          due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it isnot<br />          accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>          I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the<br />      Shambala<br />          is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>            " This Garuda-column of Vasudeva (Visnu), the god of gods, was<br />      erected<br />          here by Heliodorus, a worshipper of Vishnu, the son of Dion, and an<br />          inhabitant of Taxila, who came as Greek ambassador from the GreatKing<br />          Antialkidas to King Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, the Savior, then reigning<br />          prosperously in the fourteenth year of his kingship."</p>

<p>            1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely likedwith<br />          Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with Ajapati,<br />          descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N.. Oaks<br />          equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of Ramesis,<br />      with<br />          the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks identifies<br />      the<br />          Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was an<br />          ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic trait of<br />      words<br />          which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the letter<br />      p is<br />          often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the word<br />      sing<br />          corrupted itself into king.</p>
<p>            2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks<br />      presents a<br />          picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes and<br />          practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind which<br />      the<br />          Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies the<br />      man as<br />          a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was originally<br />          produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as well as<br />      in<br />          the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces<br />      another<br />          picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of Memphis.<br />      The<br />          pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>            Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the pyramids<br />      in<br />          Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where do<br />      they<br />          go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous references to<br />          opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, andthe<br />          tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to Shambala/Shangri La,<br />      a<br />          Vedic city in the hollow earth.</p>

<p>              I'm puzzled tho re Puri: how could Lord Krishna have<br />              left his body at Puri, when he was hit by an arrow at<br />              Bhalka Tirth outside Dwarka, GUJ?<br />              Just curious. . .<br />              Kathie<br />              ps I have photos from Konark also, if anyone wants them.</p>

        <p>Actually the whole RAdha story is somewhat controversial which is one of the reasons probably why Radha is not worshipped as much as Rukmini(atleast in southerin india). Radha was a married woman and older to Sri Krishna. </p>
<p>I am very surprised at the Draupadi wanting to marry Sri Krishna, Draupadi is technically Sri Krishna's sister, blue in complexion and her other name is Krishnaaa too. I have to verify if this is there in the Ganguli Mahabharat Translation.</p>

<blockquote><p>  oh! my favourite author..<br />  ?<br />  Yes. Krishna series books, enough to know about the whole mahabharatam and also bhagavatham. The book for children, youth and elders.<br />  ?<br />  Part 1 - How Krishna was born with four shoulders and taken?by Vasudeva, Krishna's Gokulam and His playful tactics of killing Putaki and frightening Kalinga snake at yamuna river, his subsequent love towards Radha and hisvoyage to Mathura and atlast killing his own uncle? Kamsa.? Here, on Radha's love towards Krishna,??KMM mentioned that he has taken the RadhaStory after verification from Elango's silappathikaaram, where Radha was called as Nappinnai.<br />  ?<br />  (For those who want to read in Tamil (first part), GITA SAMBASIVAM, writes in her blog. I wll find out the blog address and put it here)<br />  ?<br />  Part 2: How Krishna rejected the offer of King at Madhura by Ugrasena andmeeting first time with Pandava Brothers at Mathura, and smart love story of Rukmini and excellent war methods of Jarasandh to capture Krishna brothers, who escape to Goa, then defeated Jarasandha?in a war and dejected Jarasandha plan for grand alliance against Krishna and asked Rukmi, brother ofRukmini to prepare a fake swaymvar for tghe benefit of Sisubala, finally skuttled by SriKrishna <br />  ?<br />  Here, KM Munshi narrating in suberb way about the love affairs of Shaibyaand Rukmini with Krishna, and finally how Rukmini realise Krishna is meantfor others and not only for her own self. Excellent part.<br />  ?<br />  The most thrilling series is Part-3, Five Brothers, the complete story ofearly Pandavas, Krishna's association with them and how Krishna plans their escape route, how the cousin of Krishna Uddhava fails to learn of love with Naga beauties, and finally the real swayamvaram arranged by Krishna himself for Drowpathi and how he thwarted the efforts of Jarasandha to take away the bride violently and atlast how Drowbathi accepts all five as her husbands. This is important and a justifiable theory was found by KM Munshi forthis particular aspect where actually Krishna tells every one in the wholeseries He is for establishing dharma in the earth. VERY CLEVERLY HANDLED.<br />  ?<br />  In fact, Drowbathi (Krishnaa)?first opted for Sri Krishna as her Husband, but the clever Krishna avoided her and saying that she is suitable to more worthy person who can oppose their enemy, i.e. Dronacharya. The Love became friendliness and finally as saviour of her prestige too in various encounter of hers in future. Not only Drowbathi, Krishna gives equal importanceto Bhanumathi (Dhuriyodhana's wife)?here in this story. well handled by KMM.<br />  ?<br />  The fourth part, fifth part and sixth part (Bhima, Yudhirstra and Vedha Vyasa) all are told in very well narrated style. How Trivedham became chathurvedham is well explained in Vedha Vyasa Book. <br />  ?<br />  I always purchase and?present the Krishna series stories set to important people whenever I attend on them. The books are available in all major stores everywhere apart from BVB stalls. Very less priced. But worth is priceless.<br />  ?<br />  I suggest strongly our PS group members also. You do not find any sort ofdullness and you are assured of briskness?while reading the book, even though you are well aware the end as well the happenings.

<p>  He even has a wonderful way of dealing with Radha and Krishna. He doesn'tmince words. Radha and Krishna were lovers and very much in love. But whenKrishna's image starts expanding and he starts growing past Vrindavan, he implores Radha to go with him.. but Radha refuses and tells him: Here you will always be my Kanhaiyya.. outside you won't. I would rather live here with your memories rather than become one among many who love you etc.?</p>
<p>  In later books he shows Krishna as remembering Radha with a lot of love.?</p>

<p>    Malathy,<br />    That is not quite an original thought. I would recommend that you read<br />    Krishnavatara by KM Munshi. Wonderfully written. He makes Krishna a human<br />    albeit with wonderful qualities and the interplay between Krishna and the<br />    Pandavas is awesome. He makes Bhima into this jovial giant who keeps playing<br />    pranks on all. Also, all the "miracles" such as the raising of Mount<br />    Govardhan etc are explained very rationally and scientifically.<br />    Unfortunately, Munshiji died before he could complete it but the 7 volume<br />    set is still a treasure. I think Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan are the publishers.</p>

<p>      Thanks Arun. Actually I was impressed by what the author said on Krishna<br />      not being the stereotyped version of the playful machiavellian hero -who is<br />      somewhat of an odd mix of divine and human but more of a warrior, very<br />      intelligent politician who was ahead of his times. It might just be his idea<br />      but noone i think has thought about it that way.</p>

<p>        I have read the "Search for the Historical Krishna" and was not terribly<br />        impressed. The author gives some evidence from astronomy (using<br />      astrological<br />        charts mentioned in the VEdas, etc) to set the year as around 3100 BC for<br />        Krishna. Also some geological evidence for Saraswathi. Then he goesinto<br />      a<br />        retelling of the Mahabharatha which is pointless.

<p>          Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic' city it<br />      is<br />          regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been<br />      many<br />          places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />          Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest<br />      gorge<br />          and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has it<br />      that<br />          people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic has<br />      had<br />          many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the<br />      region<br />          due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it isnot<br />          accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>          I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the<br />      Shambala<br />          is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>oh! my favourite author..<br />?<br />Yes. Krishna series books, enough to know about the whole mahabharatam and also bhagavatham. The book for children, youth and elders.<br />?<br />Part 1 - How Krishna was born with four shoulders and taken?by Vasudeva, Krishna's Gokulam and His playful tactics of killing Putaki and frighteningKalinga snake at yamuna river, his subsequent love towards Radha and his voyage to Mathura and atlast killing his own uncle? Kamsa.? Here, on Radha's love towards Krishna,??KMM mentioned that he has taken the Radha Story after verification from Elango's silappathikaaram, where Radha was called as Nappinnai.<br />?<br />(For those who want to read in Tamil (first part), GITA SAMBASIVAM, writes in her blog. I wll find out the blog address and put it here)<br />?<br />Part 2: How Krishna rejected the offer of King at Madhura by Ugrasena and meeting first time with Pandava Brothers at Mathura, and smart love story ofRukmini and excellent war methods of Jarasandh to capture Krishna brothers, who escape to Goa, then defeated Jarasandha?in a war and dejected Jarasandha plan for grand alliance against Krishna and asked Rukmi, brother of Rukmini to prepare a fake swaymvar for tghe benefit of Sisubala, finally skuttled by SriKrishna <br />?<br />Here, KM Munshi narrating in suberb way about the love affairs of Shaibya and Rukmini with Krishna, and finally how Rukmini realise Krishna is meant for others and not only for her own self. Excellent part.<br />?<br />The most thrilling series is Part-3, Five Brothers, the complete story of early Pandavas, Krishna's association with them and how Krishna plans their escape route, how the cousin of Krishna Uddhava fails to learn of love withNaga beauties, and finally the real swayamvaram arranged by Krishna himself for Drowpathi and how he thwarted the efforts of Jarasandha to take away the bride violently and atlast how Drowbathi accepts all five as her husbands. This is important and a justifiable theory was found by KM Munshi for this particular aspect where actually Krishna tells every one in the whole series He is for establishing dharma in the earth. VERY CLEVERLY HANDLED.<br />?<br />In fact, Drowbathi (Krishnaa)?first opted for Sri Krishna as her Husband,but the clever Krishna avoided her and saying that she is suitable to moreworthy person who can oppose their enemy, i.e. Dronacharya. The Love became friendliness and finally as saviour of her prestige too in various encounter of hers in future. Not only Drowbathi, Krishna gives equal importance to Bhanumathi (Dhuriyodhana's wife)?here in this story. well handled by KMM.<br />?<br />The fourth part, fifth part and sixth part (Bhima, Yudhirstra and Vedha Vyasa) all are told in very well narrated style. How Trivedham became chathurvedham is well explained in Vedha Vyasa Book. <br />?<br />I always purchase and?present the Krishna series stories set to importantpeople whenever I attend on them. The books are available in all major stores everywhere apart from BVB stalls. Very less priced. But worth is priceless.<br />?<br />I suggest strongly our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group members also. You do not find any sort of dullness and you are assured of briskness?while reading the book, even though you are well aware the end as well the happenings. That is KMM., the Great and guide for any writer.<br />?<br />Dhivakar<br />?</acronym></p>

<p>He even has a wonderful way of dealing with Radha and Krishna. He doesn't mince words. Radha and Krishna were lovers and very much in love. But when Krishna's image starts expanding and he starts growing past Vrindavan, he implores Radha to go with him.. but Radha refuses and tells him: Here you will always be my Kanhaiyya.. outside you won't. I would rather live here withyour memories rather than become one among many who love you etc.? </p>
<p>In later books he shows Krishna as remembering Radha with a lot of love.?</p>
<p>It's a treasure I tell you.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Malathy,<br />  That is not quite an original thought. I would recommend that you read<br />  Krishnavatara by KM Munshi. Wonderfully written. He makes Krishna a human<br />  albeit with wonderful qualities and the interplay between Krishna and the<br />  Pandavas is awesome. He makes Bhima into this jovial giant who keeps playing<br />  pranks on all. Also, all the "miracles" such as the raising of Mount<br />  Govardhan etc are explained very rationally and scientifically.<br />  Unfortunately, Munshiji died before he could complete it but the 7 volume<br />  set is still a treasure. I think Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan are the publishers.</p>

<p>    Thanks Arun. Actually I was impressed by what the author said on Krishna<br />    not being the stereotyped version of the playful machiavellian hero - who is<br />    somewhat of an odd mix of divine and human but more of a warrior, very<br />    intelligent politician who was ahead of his times. It might just be hisidea<br />    but noone i think has thought about it that way.</p>

<p>      I have read the "Search for the Historical Krishna" and was not terribly<br />      impressed. The author gives some evidence from astronomy (using<br />    astrological<br />      charts mentioned in the VEdas, etc) to set the year as around 3100 BCfor<br />      Krishna. Also some geological evidence for Saraswathi. Then he goes into<br />    a<br />      retelling of the Mahabharatha which is pointless. He makes allusion to<br />      epigraphical evidence in terms of the Indus script, but doesn't really<br />    show<br />      anything.Regards,</p>

<p>        Dear SPS, thank you for the great information links. I very much<br />    enjoyed<br />        reading the extract from 'Search for the historical Krishna' and will<br />    truly<br />        wait for the book to be published.</p>
<p>        Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic' city it<br />    is<br />        regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been<br />    many<br />        places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />        Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest<br />    gorge<br />        and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has it<br />    that<br />        people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic has<br />    had<br />        many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the<br />    region<br />        due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it is not<br />        accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>        I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the<br />    Shambala<br />        is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>          1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely liked with<br />        Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with Ajapati,<br />        descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N. Oaks<br />        equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of Ramesis,<br />    with<br />        the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks identifies<br />    the<br />        Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was an<br />        ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic trait of<br />    words<br />        which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the letter<br />    p is<br />        often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the word<br />    sing<br />        corrupted itself into king.</p>
<p>          2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks<br />    presents a<br />        picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes and<br />        practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind which<br />    the<br />        Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies the<br />    man as<br />        a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was originally<br />        produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as wellas<br />    in<br />        the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces<br />    another<br />        picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of Memphis.<br />    The<br />        pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>          Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the pyramids<br />    in<br />        Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where do<br />    they<br />        go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous referencesto<br />        opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, and the<br />        tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to Shambala/ShangriLa,<br />    a<br />        Vedic city in the hollow earth.</p>

        <p>oh! my favourite author..<br />?<br />Yes. Krishna series books, enough to know about the whole mahabharatam and also bhagavatham. The book for children, youth and elders.<br />?<br />Part 1 - How Krishna was born with four shoulders and taken?by Vasudeva, Krishna's Gokulam and His playful tactics of killing Putaki and frighteningKalinga snake at yamuna river, his subsequent love towards Radha and his voyage to Mathura and atlast killing his own uncle? Kamsa.? Here, on Radha's love towards Krishna,??KMM mentioned that he has taken the Radha Story after verification from Elango's silappathikaaram, where Radha was called as Nappinnai.<br />?<br />(For those who want to read in Tamil (first part), GITA SAMBASIVAM, writes in her blog. I wll find out the blog address and put it here)<br />?<br />Part 2: How Krishna rejected the offer of King at Madhura by Ugrasena and meeting first time with Pandava Brothers at Mathura, and smart love story ofRukmini and excellent war methods of Jarasandh to capture Krishna brothers, who escape to Goa, then defeated Jarasandha?in a war and dejected Jarasandha plan for grand alliance against Krishna and asked Rukmi, brother of Rukmini to prepare a fake swaymvar for tghe benefit of Sisubala, finally skuttled by SriKrishna <br />?<br />Here, KM Munshi narrating in suberb way about the love affairs of Shaibya and Rukmini with Krishna, and finally how Rukmini realise Krishna is meant for others and not only for her own self. Excellent part.<br />?<br />The most thrilling series is Part-3, Five Brothers, the complete story of early Pandavas, Krishna's association with them and how Krishna plans their escape route, how the cousin of Krishna Uddhava fails to learn of love withNaga beauties, and finally the real swayamvaram arranged by Krishna himself for Drowpathi and how he thwarted the efforts of Jarasandha to take away the bride violently and atlast how Drowbathi accepts all five as her husbands. This is important and a justifiable theory was found by KM Munshi for this particular aspect where actually Krishna tells every one in the whole series He is for establishing dharma in the earth. VERY CLEVERLY HANDLED.<br />?<br />In fact, Drowbathi (Krishnaa)?first opted for Sri Krishna as her Husband,but the clever Krishna avoided her and saying that she is suitable to moreworthy person who can oppose their enemy, i.e. Dronacharya. The Love became friendliness and finally as saviour of her prestige too in various encounter of hers in future. Not only Drowbathi, Krishna gives equal importance to Bhanumathi (Dhuriyodhana's wife)?here in this story. well handled by KMM.<br />?<br />The fourth part, fifth part and sixth part (Bhima, Yudhirstra and Vedha Vyasa) all are told in very well narrated style. How Trivedham became chathurvedham is well explained in Vedha Vyasa Book. <br />?<br />I always purchase and?present the Krishna series stories set to importantpeople whenever I attend on them. The books are available in all major stores everywhere apart from BVB stalls. Very less priced. But worth is priceless.<br />?<br />I suggest strongly our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  group members also. You do not find any sort of dullness and you are assured of briskness?while reading the book, even though you are well aware the end as well the happenings. That is KMM., the Great and guide for any writer.<br />?<br />Dhivakar<br />?</acronym></p>

<p>He even has a wonderful way of dealing with Radha and Krishna. He doesn't mince words. Radha and Krishna were lovers and very much in love. But when Krishna's image starts expanding and he starts growing past Vrindavan, he implores Radha to go with him.. but Radha refuses and tells him: Here you will always be my Kanhaiyya.. outside you won't. I would rather live here withyour memories rather than become one among many who love you etc.?</p>
<p>In later books he shows Krishna as remembering Radha with a lot of love.?</p>
<p>It's a treasure I tell you.</p>

<p>    Thanks Arun. Actually I was impressed by what the author said on Krishna<br />    not being the stereotyped version of the playful machiavellian hero - who is<br />    somewhat of an odd mix of divine and human but more of a warrior, very<br />    intelligent politician who was ahead of his times. It might just be hisidea<br />    but noone i think has thought about it that way.</p>

<p>      I have read the "Search for the Historical Krishna" and was not terribly<br />      impressed. The author gives some evidence from astronomy (using<br />    astrological<br />      charts mentioned in the VEdas, etc) to set the year as around 3100 BCfor<br />      Krishna. Also some geological evidence for Saraswathi. Then he goes into<br />    a<br />      retelling of the Mahabharatha which is pointless. He makes allusion to<br />      epigraphical evidence in terms of the Indus script, but doesn't really<br />    show<br />      anything.Regards,</p>

<p>        Dear SPS, thank you for the great information links. I very much<br />    enjoyed<br />        reading the extract from 'Search for the historical Krishna' and will<br />    truly<br />        wait for the book to be published.</p>
<p>        Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic' city it<br />    is<br />        regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been<br />    many<br />        places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />        Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest<br />    gorge<br />        and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has it<br />    that<br />        people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic has<br />    had<br />        many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the<br />    region<br />        due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it is not<br />        accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>        I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the<br />    Shambala<br />        is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>          1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely liked with<br />        Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with Ajapati,<br />        descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N. Oaks<br />        equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of Ramesis,<br />    with<br />        the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks identifies<br />    the<br />        Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was an<br />        ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic trait of<br />    words<br />        which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the letter<br />    p is<br />        often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the word<br />    sing<br />        corrupted itself into king.</p>
<p>          2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks<br />    presents a<br />        picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes and<br />        practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind which<br />    the<br />        Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies the<br />    man as<br />        a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was originally<br />        produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as wellas<br />    in<br />        the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces<br />    another<br />        picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of Memphis.<br />    The<br />        pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>          Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the pyramids<br />    in<br />        Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where do<br />    they<br />        go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous referencesto<br />        opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, and the<br />        tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to Shambala/ShangriLa,<br />    a<br />        Vedic city in the hollow earth.</p>
<p>          regards/ sps</p>
<p>          ============ ==</p>
<p>            I'm puzzled tho re Puri: how could Lord Krishna have<br />            left his body at Puri, when he was hit by an arrow at<br />            Bhalka Tirth outside Dwarka, GUJ?<br />            Just curious. . .<br />            Kathie<br />            ps I have photos from Konark also, if anyone wants them.</p>

<p>           Dear SPS, thank you for the great information links. I very much<br />       enjoyed<br />           reading the extract from 'Search for the historical Krishna' and<br />   will<br />       truly<br />           wait for the book to be published.</p>
<p>           Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic'<br />   city it<br />       is<br />           regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have<br />   been<br />       many<br />           places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />           Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the<br />   deepest<br />       gorge<br />           and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend<br />   has it<br />       that<br />           people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic<br />   has<br />       had<br />           many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the<br />       region<br />           due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it is<br />   not<br />           accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>           I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the<br />       Shambala<br />           is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>             1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely liked<br />   with<br />           Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with<br />   Ajapati,<br />           descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N.<br />   Oaks<br />           equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of<br />   Ramesis,<br />       with<br />           the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks<br />   identifies<br />       the<br />           Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was<br />   an<br />           ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic trait of<br />       words<br />           which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the<br />   letter<br />       p is<br />           often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the<br />   word<br />       sing<br />           corrupted itself into king.</p>
<p>             2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks<br />       presents a<br />           picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes<br />   and<br />           practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind<br />   which<br />       the<br />           Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies<br />   the<br />       man as<br />           a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was<br />   originally<br />           produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as<br />   well as<br />       in<br />           the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces<br />       another<br />           picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of<br />   Memphis.<br />       The<br />           pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>             Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the<br />   pyramids<br />       in<br />           Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where<br />   do<br />       they<br />           go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous<br />   references to<br />           opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, and<br />   the<br />           tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to<br />   Shambala/Shangri La,<br />       a<br />           Vedic city in the hollow earth.</p>

<p>               I'm puzzled tho re Puri: how could Lord Krishna have<br />               left his body at Puri, when he was hit by an arrow at<br />               Bhalka Tirth outside Dwarka, GUJ?<br />               Just curious. . .<br />               Kathie<br />               ps I have photos from Konark also, if anyone wants them.</p>

<p>    Malathy,<br />    That is not quite an original thought. I would recommend that you read<br />    Krishnavatara by KM Munshi. Wonderfully written. He makes Krishna a human<br />    albeit with wonderful qualities and the interplay between Krishna and the<br />    Pandavas is awesome. He makes Bhima into this jovial giant who keeps<br />  playing<br />    pranks on all. Also, all the "miracles" such as the raising of Mount<br />    Govardhan etc are explained very rationally and scientifically.<br />    Unfortunately, Munshiji died before he could complete it but the 7 volume<br />    set is still a treasure. I think Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan are the<br />  publishers.</p>

On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks<br />      presents a<br />          picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes<br />  and<br />          practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind<br />  which<br />      the<br />          Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies<br />  the<br />      man as<br />          a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was<br />  originally<br />          produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as well<br />  as<br />      in<br />          the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces<br />      another<br />          picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of<br />  Memphis.<br />      The<br />          pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>            Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the<br />  pyramids<br />      in<br />          Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where<br />  do<br />      they<br />          go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous references<br />  to<br />          opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, and<br />  the<br />          tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to Shambala/Shangri<br />  La,<br />      a<br />          Vedic city in the hollow earth.</p>

<p>              I'm puzzled tho re Puri: how could Lord Krishna have<br />              left his body at Puri, when he was hit by an arrow at<br />              Bhalka Tirth outside Dwarka, GUJ?<br />              Just curious. . .<br />              Kathie<br />              ps I have photos from Konark also, if anyone wants them.</p>

<p>    Thanks Arun. Actually I was impressed by what the author said on Krishna<br />    not being the stereotyped version of the playful machiavellian hero - who is<br />    somewhat of an odd mix of divine and human but more of a warrior, very<br />    intelligent politician who was ahead of his times.

<p>      I have read the "Search for the Historical Krishna" and was not terribly<br />      impressed. The author gives some evidence from astronomy (using<br />    astrological<br />      charts mentioned in the VEdas, etc) to set the year as around 3100 BCfor<br />      Krishna. Also some geological evidence for Saraswathi. Then he goes into<br />    a<br />      retelling of the Mahabharatha which is pointless. He makes allusion to<br />      epigraphical evidence in terms of the Indus script, but doesn't really<br />    show<br />      anything.Regards,</p>

<p>        Dear SPS, thank you for the great information links. I very much<br />    enjoyed<br />        reading the extract from 'Search for the historical Krishna' and will<br />    truly<br />        wait for the book to be published.</p>
<p>        Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic' city it<br />    is<br />        regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been<br />    many<br />        places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />        Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest<br />    gorge<br />        and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has it<br />    that<br />        people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic has<br />    had<br />        many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the<br />    region<br />        due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it is not<br />        accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>        I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the<br />    Shambala<br />        is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>          " This Garuda-column of Vasudeva (Visnu), the god of gods, was<br />    erected<br />        here by Heliodorus, a worshipper of Vishnu, the son of Dion, and an<br />        inhabitant of Taxila, who came as Greek ambassador from the Great King<br />        Antialkidas to King Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, the Savior, then reigning<br />        prosperously in the fourteenth year of his kingship."</p>

<p>          1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely liked with<br />        Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with Ajapati,<br />        descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N. Oaks<br />        equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of Ramesis,<br />    with<br />        the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks identifies<br />    the<br />        Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was an<br />        ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic trait of<br />    words<br />        which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the letter<br />    p is<br />        often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the word<br />    sing<br />        corrupted itself into king.</p>
<p>          2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks<br />    presents a<br />        picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes and<br />        practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind which<br />    the<br />        Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies the<br />    man as<br />        a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was originally<br />        produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as wellas<br />    in<br />        the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces<br />    another<br />        picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of Memphis.<br />    The<br />        pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>          Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the pyramids<br />    in<br />        Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where do<br />    they<br />        go?

<p>      Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic' city it<br />  is<br />      regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been<br />  many<br />      places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />      Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest<br />  gorge<br />      and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has it<br />  that<br />      people who go there do not come back.

<p>        1. the pyramids of Egypt and the Sphinx have been closely liked with<br />      Vedic culture. Writer P.N. Oaks has linked the name Egypt with Ajapati,<br />      descendents of Aja, Shree Rama's grandfather. Etymologically, P.N. Oaks<br />      equates the title of Egypt's ancient rulers, the dynasty of Ramesis,<br />  with<br />      the Sanskrit words "Ram Eisus," meaning "Ram- God." Mr. Oaks identifies<br />  the<br />      Sphinx with the word "Sing" in Sanskrit, meaning lion, as this was an<br />      ancient word for the sovereign. It is a common linguistic trait of<br />  words<br />      which have descended from Sanskrit and become corrupted that the letter<br />  p is<br />      often silent and the letter h hardly pronounced. In English, the word<br />  sing<br />      corrupted itself into king.</p>
<p>        2. On page 613 of his book Our World Vedic Heritage, Mr. Oaks<br />  presents a<br />      picture of an ancient, Egyptian statue of a man dressed in robes and<br />      practically covered with Vishnu tilak and sandal paste, the kind which<br />  the<br />      Shree Vaishnava sect uses in South India. The caption identifies the<br />  man as<br />      a designer of the pyramids and a Dravidian. The picture was originally<br />      produced in the book Egyptian Myth and Legend, on page 368, as well as<br />  in<br />      the book: Long Missing Links. On the next page P.N. Oaks produces<br />  another<br />      picture from the book Long Missing links, that of a pharaoh of Memphis.<br />  The<br />      pharaoh is also using tilak just like the Shree Vaishnavas.</p>
<p>        Miles and miles of tunnels and chambers exist underneath the pyramids<br />  in<br />      Egypt, so deep that they still have not been fully explored. Where do<br />  they<br />      go? In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are numerous references to<br />      opulent, subterranean worlds, accessed through these tunnels, and the<br />      tunnels under Tibet are deemed to lead directly to Shambala/Shangri La,<br />  a<br />      Vedic city in the hollow earth.</p>

He makes allusion to<br />epigraphical evidence in terms of the Indus script, but doesn't really show<br />anything.Regards,</p>

<p>  Dear SPS, thank you for the great information links. I very much enjoyed<br />  reading the extract from 'Search for the historical Krishna' and will truly<br />  wait for the book to be published.</p>
<p>  Just a small correction to below, the Shambala is not a 'vedic' city it is<br />  regarded as tibetan buddhist paradiase or 'Beyul' and there have been many<br />  places attributed to it - mostly the explored regions of eastern<br />  Himalayas/Tibel and the Tsangpo Gorge which supposedly are the deepest gorge<br />  and 108 foot high waterfall which nobody has really seen, legend has it that<br />  people who go there do not come back. Even the National Geographic has had<br />  many expeditions to that area but none truly into the heart of the region<br />  due to its difficult geographic terrain, and as legends say it is not<br />  accessible to the ordinary man.</p>
<p>  I have not heard of any connection to Shambala and pyramids as the Shambala<br />  is a very eastern concept.</p>

<p>        Dear Members,<br />        Last week I had a chance to visit Puri, Konark and Lingaraj Temple <br />      (BBSR). When traveling by road from Bhuvaneshwar to Puri, I had a  <br />      feeling that I was traveling from Tanjore to Nagai.<br />        Like that road from Puri to Konark resembles our ECR.<br />        Iam attaching some of the photos in this mail and more I will  <br />      upload in PSVP site.<br />        Kind regards,<br />        Kannan.R.</p>
