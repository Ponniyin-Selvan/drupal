<p>WONDERFUL.. DEAR SIR...  <br />LATERAL THINKING.</p>

<p>IF YOU TAKE OUT THE BLACK PEBBLE - YOU HAVE TO MARRY ME... "</p>

<p>OF COURSE SHE HAD SEVERAL OPTIONS CALLING HIM CHEAT.. EXPOSING ETC. ETC. BUT SHE CLEVERLY USES THIS TO HER ADVANTAGE.</p>
<p>SHE CLOSES HER EYES AND TAKESOUT A PEBBLE AND DROP IT DOWN... IT VANISHES DOWN HILL..</p>

<p>SHE JUST FOCUSSED HER ATTENTION FROM THE PEBBLE COMING OUT - TO THE PEBBLE THAT REMAINED INSIDE THE BAG ....</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Shaswanth<br />Its an interesting line of thought.....I think Kalki explains in more than one place that Nandhini possible was chaste .....</p>
<p>The Child she clearly tells Vandhiyadevan is not hers..'' engeo pidithu vantha kulandaiyai Veera pandiayn magan enkirargal...'' she is shown as the foster mother....</p>
<p>She pieces the puzzle only before she dissapears with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  explaining about Mandakini...Her interactions with Madhuranthagan were merely as a pawn to cause chaos in the system and not as a sibling...</p>
<p>It also raises another interesting question....Mandakinis children..a womanwho has so much love for Sundara how did she beget childran from some one else?</p>
<p>Was she amnesic after her fall which was taken advantage by the Pandya kingor Kauthirumaan???</p>
<p>Or was she that pretty and two monarchs lost them to her??? </p>
<p>If so when did she snap out of it...the agony of childbirth?? If so did sheunderstand she has born the children to another man that is not her beloved???</p>
<p>Its a really convoluted food for thought</p>

<p>?</p>
<p>Some more speculation:</p>
<p>Nandini had quite a lot of interaction with the old Madhurantakan.</p>
<p>During all this time, she didn't reveal his parentage to him. Also,</p>
<p>she actively conspired against him, all the way to the end. It was</p>
<p>only Karuthiruman who ended up "rescuing" Madhurantakan from being an</p>
<p>illegitimate Chola prince to being the heir to the Pandya throne. This</p>
<p>gives me the impression that either a) she didn't know of it herself -</p>
<p>"it" could be either knowledge of her own parentage, or the fact that</p>
<p>Madhurantakan was her twin, or b) she didn't care - she wanted to rule</p>
<p>through her son.</p>
<p>This again raises another question: Why shouldn't she try taking</p>
<p>Madhurantakan as another Pandya prince under her thumb, the way</p>
<p>Kundavai had both Karikalan and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  (also <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  actually)? If one gets</p>
<p>killed / gets deposed / doesn't want the throne or whatever, she still</p>
<p>has the other to dominate, if that were her goal.</p>
<p>Therefore, either she didn't know, or wanted only her son to come to</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Some more speculation:</p>
<p>Nandini had quite a lot of interaction with the old Madhurantakan.<br />During all this time, she didn't reveal his parentage to him. Also,<br />she actively conspired against him, all the way to the end. It was<br />only Karuthiruman who ended up "rescuing" Madhurantakan from being an<br />illegitimate Chola prince to being the heir to the Pandya throne. This<br />gives me the impression that either a) she didn't know of it herself -<br />"it" could be either knowledge of her own parentage, or the fact that<br />Madhurantakan was her twin, or b) she didn't care - she wanted to rule<br />through her son.</p>
<p>This again raises another question: Why shouldn't she try taking<br />Madhurantakan as another Pandya prince under her thumb, the way<br />Kundavai had both Karikalan and <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  (also <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  actually)? If one gets<br />killed / gets deposed / doesn't want the throne or whatever, she still<br />has the other to dominate, if that were her goal.</acronym></p>
<p>Therefore, either she didn't know, or wanted only her son to come to<br />the Pandya throne, and not even her twin.</p>
<p>If she didn't know, maybe she only found out after Karuthiruman and<br />Pazhaiya Madurantakan landed up in the Abatudaivigal camp, and only<br />then was she able to put the pieces together...</p>
<p>What she says to either <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  or <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym are probably 50% karpanai - she's<br />trying to manipulate them right upto the end, and she'd say anything<br />to anyone else, too. What she says to Pazhuvetaraiyar when they are in<br />the cave is a little more believable, because she has nothing to gain<br />by manipulating him at that point.</acronym></p>

Which is probably why Kalki puts in that<br />enigmatic sentence in the ending note, to the effect that she tells<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  "the truth about who killed Aditya Karikalan, and about her<br />parentage".</acronym></p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Yes Venkat really there is no shortage of goody goody women at all especially in historical novels. If we think some of kalki's women (liek the much hated Vaanathi) was like that then one has to read Akilan and Sandilyan. Allwomen are beautiful in standard ways, karpukkarasigal, and repeated standard lines.athaan this that..sometimes aiyoooo endru kathidalam..like you if you see old tamil movies you can say about 2 minutes ahead that the heroinefemale is going to burst into tears with some pure tamil dialogue.</p>
<p>Kalki's women were much more flesh and blood than that. Kundavi you can make out she is somewhat bossy by nature, even the senior Sembian madhevi you get a sense of what a controlling mom she was judging by the way pazhaiya madhurantakan just wants to break out and live his ambitions. Nandini and Poonguzhali definitely very human characters, far from perfect, one need not say more.</p>
<p>We can forgive his lapses given the humanness in the characters. But undoubtedly they were lapses. The British court ruled in favor of Conan Doyle killing Sherlock holmes to finish his story but also did not fail to mention that every author is indebted to his readers who keep his writing alive. If anyone does not say <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  ending left them disappointed/strangely lost/'what is this' type of a feeling that is a total lie. For that we have to hold theauthor accountable as much as we love him dearly.</p>

<blockquote><p>  I would agree that with Sundara Chozhar. How his love for Mandakini changes<br />  to hatred during the last few days of his life.</p></blockquote>
<p>its very common isnt it. we often end up hating those we have loved too much.</p>
<p>kalki follows it in many relationships</p>
<p>vanthiyathevan- kandamaran<br />karikalan nandini<br />paluvettaraiyar nandini<br />sundara solan mandakini</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<blockquote><p>  That was a good study of human psychology. But Nadhini contracting herself,<br />  calling Veerapandiyan 'Anbe' when other circumstances lead to the fact that<br />  he was her father, this is definitely a slip.</p>
<p>  But ofcourse this is a very small slip as you said since he was writing a<br />  thodar.<br />  On the brighter side, but for this slip we would not have such a nice<br />  discussion happening here :)<br />  (which seem to happen whenever one of our members finish reading PS for the<br />  first time ;) )</p>
<p>  So either way Kalki rocks :)</p>

<p>could it be the reason he left the book unfinished and rather abruptly at that????</p>

        <p>I would agree that with Sundara Chozhar. How his love for Mandakini changes<br />to hatred during the last few days of his life.<br />That was a good study of human psychology. But Nadhini contracting herself,<br />calling Veerapandiyan 'Anbe' when other circumstances lead to the fact that<br />he was her father, this is definitely a slip.</p>
<p>But ofcourse this is a very small slip as you said since he was writing a<br />thodar.<br />On the brighter side, but for this slip we would not have such a nice<br />discussion happening here :)<br />(which seem to happen whenever one of our members finish reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  for the<br />first time ;) )</acronym></p>
<p>So either way Kalki rocks :)</p>

        <p>Thats a very convinient way of putting it :)<br />I had the same thot when i first finished <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . I was at awe on how he could<br />concieved such a complex and unpredictable character.<br />I was totally spell bound by the book and became a major fan of Kalki :).<br />Hence couldnt accept that he had gone wrong.<br />But further reading and rationale discussions on this led me to think that<br />indeed there may be a slip.<br />As they say 'Yaanaikum Adi Sarukum'.</acronym></p>
