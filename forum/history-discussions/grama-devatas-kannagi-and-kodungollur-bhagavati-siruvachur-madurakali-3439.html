</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Connection between Mathurakaaliyamman temple of Siruvachur and <br />Kannagi is also establised.</p>
<p>Kannagi after her vengence against Madurai, visited many places <br />for 'Shanthi'. She once came to Srivachur, the temple then <br />was 'Selliyamman temple'. </p>
<p>There was a 'poosari' in selliyamman temple, who had obtained a <br />promise from the goddess that she should do as he wishes. Mother <br />compasionate, gave her consent. The 'Poosari' started performing <br />atrocities, and Selliyamman could not bear it, but she could not do <br />anything because of the promise.</p>
<p>During this time, when the 'Poosari' was away on his duties, Kannagi <br />visited the temple, and she found Goddess Selliyamman, very muich <br />unhappy. She then was told by Goddess what happened. Kannagi, with <br />the permission of Seliyamman, requested 'Madhuraiyaritha Kaali', to <br />help her. Kaali, then requested Selliyamman, to go to a nearest hill <br />and stay up there, and she will occupy her position here in the <br />temple.</p>
<p>The 'Poosari' who retuned to temple after his job, was surprised and <br />shocked to find Kaali, with all her fury sitting in place of <br />Selliyamman. Knowing his end, he requested his samadhi to be in the <br />temple, and people to stamp over his body and worship her, and Kaali <br />to stay parmanently at this temple. Kaali granted his wishes.</p>
<p>Below the steps of moolasthaanam, si belived to be that 'Poosari's' <br />samadhi.</p>
<p>So Siruvachur became famous for Madhurakaali and still Selliyamman <br />occupies a temple in nearby hill.</p>
<p>So Sirivachur has 2000 years old history.</p>

<p>    The author of that article had given multiple evidence to relate <br />  this<br />    temple with Kannagi.</p>
<p>    1. Some traditions during temple festivals with Gold-smiths.<br />    2. He stats an hidden room in basement behind Bhagavti temple <br />  and<br />    that is opened once in a year for some puja. etc.</p>
<p>    Since I had read this article long time ago, could not recollect <br />  some<br />    thing more here. If any one read this article or know something<br />    related to this.</p>

<p>six months ago on the trichy madurai road very close to madurai <br />i happened to walk into the fields say some 200 feet from the busy <br />high way.<br />the man who took me pointed out to many ancient stone lined wells all <br />in one line and well spaced and said this was the ancient route.<br />he also added that this was the route kannagi and kovalan took from <br />puhar.<br />also thirukadaiyur is the hometown of madhavi. next to the famous <br />hotel sadabishekam is a large pond called madhavi kuttai.</p>
<p>I guess people have very long memories for silapadikaram preceded the <br />history on which this group is concentrating by many centuries.</p>
<p>but personally I have a very radical view on kannagi which many cannot <br />subscribe to. she could not correct her wayward husband but takes it <br />upon to burn a city just because it is ruled by an inefficient ruler.</p>

<p>      Connection between Mathurakaaliyamman temple of Siruvachur and<br />      Kannagi is also establised.</p>
<p>      Kannagi after her vengence against Madurai, visited many places<br />      for 'Shanthi'. She once came to Srivachur, the temple then<br />      was 'Selliyamman temple'.</p>
<p>      There was a 'poosari' in selliyamman temple, who had obtained a<br />      promise from the goddess that she should do as he wishes. Mother<br />      compasionate, gave her consent. The 'Poosari' started performing<br />      atrocities, and Selliyamman could not bear it, but she could not <br />  do<br />      anything because of the promise.</p>
<p>      During this time, when the 'Poosari' was away on his duties, <br />  Kannagi<br />      visited the temple, and she found Goddess Selliyamman, very <br />muich<br />      unhappy. She then was told by Goddess what happened. Kannagi, <br />  with<br />      the permission of Seliyamman, requested 'Madhuraiyaritha Kaali', <br />  to<br />      help her. Kaali, then requested Selliyamman, to go to a nearest <br />  hill<br />      and stay up there, and she will occupy her position here in the<br />      temple.</p>
<p>      The 'Poosari' who retuned to temple after his job, was surprised <br />  and<br />      shocked to find Kaali, with all her fury sitting in place of<br />      Selliyamman. Knowing his end, he requested his samadhi to be in <br />  the<br />      temple, and people to stamp over his body and worship her, and <br />  Kaali<br />      to stay parmanently at this temple. Kaali granted his wishes.</p>
<p>      Below the steps of moolasthaanam, si belived to be <br />  that 'Poosari's'<br />      samadhi.</p>
<p>      So Siruvachur became famous for Madhurakaali and still <br />  Selliyamman<br />      occupies a temple in nearby hill.</p>
<p>      So Sirivachur has 2000 years old history.</p>

<p>  six months ago on the trichy madurai road very close<br />  to madurai <br />  i happened to walk into the fields say some 200 feet<br />  from the busy <br />  high way.<br />  the man who took me pointed out to many ancient<br />  stone lined wells all <br />  in one line and well spaced and said this was the<br />  ancient route.<br />  he also added that this was the route kannagi and<br />  kovalan took from <br />  puhar.<br />  also thirukadaiyur is the hometown of madhavi. next<br />  to the famous <br />  hotel sadabishekam is a large pond called madhavi<br />  kuttai.</p>
<p>  I guess people have very long memories for<br />  silapadikaram preceded the <br />  history on which this group is concentrating by many<br />  centuries.</p>
<p>  but personally I have a very radical view on kannagi<br />  which many cannot <br />  subscribe to. she could not correct her wayward<br />  husband but takes it <br />  upon to burn a city just because it is ruled by an<br />  inefficient ruler.</p>

<p>    Personally, I feel what people knew about<br />  something, may not be 100% <br />    incorrect. Any information on this temple from<br />  anyone?</p>

<p>        Connection between Mathurakaaliyamman temple<br />  of Siruvachur and<br />        Kannagi is also establised.</p>
<p>        Kannagi after her vengence against Madurai,<br />  visited many places<br />        for 'Shanthi'. She once came to Srivachur, the<br />  temple then<br />        was 'Selliyamman temple'.</p>
<p>        There was a 'poosari' in selliyamman temple,<br />  who had obtained a<br />        promise from the goddess that she should do as<br />  he wishes. Mother<br />        compasionate, gave her consent. The 'Poosari'<br />  started performing<br />        atrocities, and Selliyamman could not bear it,<br />  but she could not <br />    do<br />        anything because of the promise.</p>
<p>        During this time, when the 'Poosari' was away<br />  on his duties, <br />    Kannagi<br />        visited the temple, and she found Goddess<br />  Selliyamman, very <br />  muich<br />        unhappy. She then was told by Goddess what<br />  happened. Kannagi, <br />    with<br />        the permission of Seliyamman, requested<br />  'Madhuraiyaritha Kaali', <br />    to<br />        help her. Kaali, then requested Selliyamman,<br />  to go to a nearest <br />    hill<br />        and stay up there, and she will occupy her<br />  position here in the<br />        temple.</p>
<p>        The 'Poosari' who retuned to temple after his<br />  job, was surprised <br />    and<br />        shocked to find Kaali, with all her fury<br />  sitting in place of<br />        Selliyamman. Knowing his end, he requested his<br />  samadhi to be in <br />    the<br />        temple, and people to stamp over his body and<br />  worship her, and <br />    Kaali<br />        to stay parmanently at this temple. Kaali<br />  granted his wishes.</p>
<p>        Below the steps of moolasthaanam, si belived<br />  to be <br />    that 'Poosari's'<br />        samadhi.</p>
<p>        So Siruvachur became famous for Madhurakaali<br />  and still <br />    Selliyamman<br />        occupies a temple in nearby hill.</p>
<p>        So Sirivachur has 2000 years old history.</p>

        <p>Venkat,</p>
<p>I beg to differ on the ruler.</p>
<p>The ruler was one of the best of rulers, and he was <br />called 'Aariyapadai Kadantha Nedunchezian'. He drove the Arya's and <br />inflicted crushing defeat on them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the way he and his wife repenats for commiting this <br />blunder is also stunning. 'Yano arasan? yaane Kalvan'</p>
<p>So, personally, I feel, this was his bad time to have taken this <br />deceisions. But, Tamil kings stood majestic even in accepting a <br />mistake.</p>

<p>        Connection between Mathurakaaliyamman temple of Siruvachur <br />and<br />        Kannagi is also establised.</p>
<p>        Kannagi after her vengence against Madurai, visited many <br />places<br />        for 'Shanthi'. She once came to Srivachur, the temple then<br />        was 'Selliyamman temple'.</p>
<p>        There was a 'poosari' in selliyamman temple, who had <br />obtained a<br />        promise from the goddess that she should do as he wishes. <br />Mother<br />        compasionate, gave her consent. The 'Poosari' started <br />performing<br />        atrocities, and Selliyamman could not bear it, but she could <br />not <br />    do<br />        anything because of the promise.</p>
<p>        During this time, when the 'Poosari' was away on his duties, <br />    Kannagi<br />        visited the temple, and she found Goddess Selliyamman, very <br />  muich<br />        unhappy. She then was told by Goddess what happened. <br />Kannagi, <br />    with<br />        the permission of Seliyamman, requested 'Madhuraiyaritha <br />Kaali', <br />    to<br />        help her. Kaali, then requested Selliyamman, to go to a <br />nearest <br />    hill<br />        and stay up there, and she will occupy her position here in <br />the<br />        temple.</p>
<p>        The 'Poosari' who retuned to temple after his job, was <br />surprised <br />    and<br />        shocked to find Kaali, with all her fury sitting in place of<br />        Selliyamman. Knowing his end, he requested his samadhi to be <br />in <br />    the<br />        temple, and people to stamp over his body and worship her, <br />and <br />    Kaali<br />        to stay parmanently at this temple. Kaali granted his wishes.</p>
<p>        Below the steps of moolasthaanam, si belived to be <br />    that 'Poosari's'<br />        samadhi.</p>
<p>        So Siruvachur became famous for Madhurakaali and still <br />    Selliyamman<br />        occupies a temple in nearby hill.</p>
<p>        So Sirivachur has 2000 years old history.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Connection between Mathurakaaliyamman temple of Siruvachur and<br />  Kannagi is also establised.</p>
<p>  Kannagi after her vengence against Madurai, visited many places<br />  for 'Shanthi'. She once came to Srivachur, the temple then<br />  was 'Selliyamman temple'.</p>
<p>  There was a 'poosari' in selliyamman temple, who had obtained a<br />  promise from the goddess that she should do as he wishes. Mother<br />  compasionate, gave her consent. The 'Poosari' started performing<br />  atrocities, and Selliyamman could not bear it, but she could not do<br />  anything because of the promise.</p>
<p>  During this time, when the 'Poosari' was away on his duties, Kannagi<br />  visited the temple, and she found Goddess Selliyamman, very muich<br />  unhappy. She then was told by Goddess what happened. Kannagi, with<br />  the permission of Seliyamman, requested 'Madhuraiyaritha Kaali', to<br />  help her. Kaali, then requested Selliyamman, to go to a nearest hill<br />  and stay up there, and she will occupy her position here in the<br />  temple.</p>
<p>  The 'Poosari' who retuned to temple after his job, was surprised and<br />  shocked to find Kaali, with all her fury sitting in place of<br />  Selliyamman. Knowing his end, he requested his samadhi to be in the<br />  temple, and people to stamp over his body and worship her, and Kaali<br />  to stay parmanently at this temple. Kaali granted his wishes.</p>
<p>  Below the steps of moolasthaanam, si belived to be that 'Poosari's'<br />  samadhi.</p>
<p>  So Siruvachur became famous for Madhurakaali and still Selliyamman<br />  occupies a temple in nearby hill.</p>
<p>  So Sirivachur has 2000 years old history.</p>
