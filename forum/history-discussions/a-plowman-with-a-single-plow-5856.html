<p>What he said:</p>
<p>Her arms have the beauty</p>
<p>of a gently moving bamboo.</p>
<p>Her large eyes are full of peace.</p>
<p>She is faraway,</p>
<p>her place not easy to reach.</p>
<p>My heart is frantic</p>
<p>with haste,</p>
<p>a plowman with a single plow</p>
<p>on land all wet</p>
<p>and ready for seed.</p>
<p>Poet:Oreulavanar("The poet of the plowman with the single plow")</p>
<p>Translated by A.K.Ramanujan</p>
<p>This poem has an openly erotic allusion to it. The last lines express<br />the desperate desire of the Hero to make love to his women.</p>

<p>Hi chitra</p>
<p>Am threading on a very thin line - but since lots of you have already<br />posted on this, am just putting a few pointers - just for better<br />understanding - for i sincerely believe, all are born equal and its<br />the deeds we do that mark greatness during our short stay.</p>
<p>antiquity in verse</p>
<p>The mantra recited at the time of Yajnopavita is given in<br />Brahmopanishad and it goes like this:</p>
<p>'Yagnopavitam paramam pavitram prajapateryatsahajam purastat'<br />(Yajnopavita is high and sacred; it was born with Prajapati, of old)</p>
<p>anitiquity in practise</p>
<p>some pointers to this is that a piece of deer skin is traditionally<br />bound into thread. does this vestige - point to that it was more a <br />way<br />of wearing the upper garment during a religious ceremony? we can<br />argue, but this could point to the fact that this could be a practise<br />from pre cloth days!!</p>
<p>Who was worshipped</p>
<p>It must be pointed out again that the great mantra popularly known as<br />Gayatri, after the metre in which it is composed is really called<br />Savitri since it is dedicated to Savita, the sun-god. This mantra is<br />found in the Rigveda. So in essence pointer again to worshipping<br />nature - sun god</p>
<p>Who wore it</p>
<p>The sacrificial string of a Brahmana shall be made of cotton, (shall<br />be) twisted to the right and consist of three threads; that of a<br />Kshatriya of hempen threads; and that of a Vaisya of woollen threads.<br />again ref from the Rig veda</p>
<p>now,we can again see references in literate to this - maybe someone<br />can view references to ramayana - and post.</p>
<p>fortunately or unfortunately there is never a mention here of man or <br />women.</p>
<p>traditionally the wards father would take him to the appropriate guru<br />and then this ceremony would happen. So to prove that this was not a<br />excl boy's act, we need to see ref of women being sent to school aka<br />gurukuls in literature. ( Art seems to already point this, as seen<br />from the sculpture)</p>
<p>what is it made off:</p>
<p>earlier mentions seem to just point it to be an upper garment that <br />was<br />worn in the particular way during performance of certain rituals.<br />depiction is sculpture/art - also follows this argument - as its <br />shown<br />to be much more thicker than just the present day thread.</p>
<p>The components as of today</p>
<p>The yajnopavita consists of three cords and each cord is formed by<br />twisting three threads into one. Actually it is made up of one single<br />cord only. At the one end of the cord of required length a loop will<br />be formed through which the other end of the cord is pulled three<br />times to form three lines of equal length and at the same time the<br />cord is also passed round the loop to ultimately form a knot at the<br />centre. This knot is known as Brahma-granthi, Brahma-knot, indeed a<br />very significant name<br />for it represents the formless Brahman, the Supreme Principle</p>
<p>In days of yore, a Brahmana meditating upon the Gayatri holding the<br />Brahma knot, had the power to bless and curse others.</p>
<p>The different stages</p>
<p>There were strict control on the dates of graduation from one stage <br />to<br />other - like 5-8 seems the limit for the first stage. dont want to<br />confuse more with the actual names, but this is when he proceeds from<br />being a baby into a student - invested with his first responsibilites<br />- he is given one string ( made of three loops of the thread) ....</p>
<p>as he passes into his next stage - gets married he gets another set -<br />which is interpreted as taking on the addnl responsibilites of his<br />partner - wife. this can be again concluded as - at times the thread<br />was worn by both man &amp; women - but inorder to free up the women for<br />the other work, the burden was passed on to the man.</p>
<p>Again - not fool proof, could be a later idai sorugal, but we could<br />rake up literature...</p>
<p>the final stage is the transition from 2 -3, unfortunate happening of<br />you becoming the head of the family...loosing your...so you take on<br />his burden as well.</p>
<p>what does it signify?</p>
<p>The yajnopavita hanging from the left shoulder and passing under the<br />right arm, constantly reminds a man that he is a bonded worker for an<br />indefinite period and that he can free himself of this bondage made <br />up<br />of three gunas by discharging his duties to his ancestors, to the<br />Rishis, and ultimately to the Gods.</p>
<p>Again there are different versions of this - incl the every present<br />diff in thickness of thread between the two major sects...which is a<br />discussion within itself.</p>

        <p>SPS Sir,</p>
<p>They were compared to Ranganathar and probably Ranganayaki thAyAr. <br />It could not be Andal, as Andal is of a very later date, even to be <br />considered as a uvamai for Sita. And Sita never worshipped Andal. As <br />per the legends, Sita or Ranganayaki thAyAr is Personification of <br />Lakshmi or Sridevi, while Andal is Personification of Bhoomadevi. <br />Some even say that Andal is personification of NILA devi. </p>

        <p>Yes; Wearing Poonal has absolutely nothing to do with being a Brahmin. I think<br />Cho's "Enge Brahmanan" makes a good account of this (if i remember<br />correctly).<br />The threads in a Poonal are supposed to represent the tasks a person<br />undergoes during his or her (yes, my neighbor who is of Telegu origin wears<br />one) lifetime from being a Brahmachaari (serving his father, mother,<br />sibling) to being a husband(father,mother,wife,sibling), father and so on.<br />Also if i remember correctly Cho describes the threads in the Poonal which<br />represent the task of each caste. It has a very good account about this.<br />Fascinating Stuff!!! I'll see if i can find it and post it in this group.</p>

<p>This particular subject is close to my heart at present. ok. DID MGR <br />SEE THIS EVENT? THEN WHAT WAS HIS AGE. It seems people from AIADMK <br />claim that 1917 MGR was born. Emden bombing Chennai took place on <br />22nd Sept.1914 at 9.20 PM.</p>
<p>If you have any information please pass it on to me</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>Dhivakar</p>

<p>  Hi venkat</p>
<p>  maybe they had a reason to do it - the death or sickness of a king <br />  does spawn ( in most places) bitter power struggles - so inorder <br />to <br />  have sufficient time to secure the next and the <br />frontlines .....kalki <br />  showed it beautifully when sundara cholar was bedridden...divakar <br />  sir's Tirumalai Tirudan also starts in such a scenerio....the <br />king is <br />  dead, long live the king - was not possible unless the successor <br />was <br />  really strong - or the contest already laid to rest - in case of <br />RJC -<br />  RRC and he co ruling for 3 years !! ...well RJC crowned his son <br />  pretty fast in 1018....within 4 years of him taking over the <br />  reigns..attimes this was dangerous as well - our beloved AK...</p>
<p>  the greatest left no trace - even RRC's pallipadai ( sps <br />sir)....not <br />  found yet....</p>
<p>  have been trying to find out the origins of this particular post in<br />  wiki without much success:<br />  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola- <br />  Chalukya_wars <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola-Chalukya_wars" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola-Chalukya_wars">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola-Chalukya_wars</a><br />  1015 Chalukya reclaim Raichur after the Chola army leave for<br />  Rajaraja Chola's funeral at Thanjavur. River Tungabhadra become<br />  almost a permanent border between the two kingdoms.</http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chola-></p>
<p>  How can we find the proof for above. if we can find the workings<br />  for above, we can atleast pin down RRC year of demise...</p>

        <p>Deepa,</p>
<p>Weaing Poonal has nothing to do with being born as a<br />brahmin. A boy becomes a bramhin (bramachari) only<br />after this poonal ceremony. For wearing a poonal or<br />becoming a bramachari - birth in a bramhin family is<br />not a pre-requisite.</p>
<p>The practice would have faded because of the stringent<br />rules that apply to a bramachari. Other sect of<br />people who may not have been able follow the same<br />would have stopped the practice.</p>
<p>As far as women are concerned, this is not a right<br />which has been snached. But a duty which is not cast<br />on them. Women have been entrusted with lot many other<br />duties, which now has very little relevance. Hence<br />would have got faded.</p>

<p>Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>Dhivakar.</p>
<p>Hi </p>
<p>MGR was born in srilanka. moved to chennai when he was 2 years old. <br />and spent almost 10 years in kumbakonam after that( no records on <br />whether he visited chennai during the 10 years)</p>

        <p>Hi,<br />Looks like the poet has been very much viewing things from a farming perspective. He has chosen to express his purity of love by comparing himself to a farmer, who would with all natural and pure love get down to the act of seeding the fertile  land. Somehow eroticism is an ellai-marai-kaai, unless we want to view it.<br />Regards<br />Nanda<br />----- Original Message ----<br />From: Vairam <vairam@gmail.com <br />To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />Sent: Wednesday, 21 May, 2008 10:19:40 PM<br />Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Re: a plowman with a single plow</vairam@gmail.com></p>
<p>Please read the last two lines ....<br />The clue is the man compares himself as the farmer with a plough...<br />and women as a land wet and ready...<br />The last lines are very open double meaning(allusion in purist<br />terms)...Please understand it and enjoy it...i cant explain it!</p>

<p>    Hi Vairam, Malathi,</p>
<p>    Have you guys come across some good western<br />  country music ? I guess <br />    you both are based in the US... Most of these<br />  songs carry this tender <br />    feeling in utterly simple words. Lets sample a few<br />  songs here, if you <br />    have the patience to read:</p>
<p>    George Strait - It just comes natural<br />    ====================================</p>
<p>    Sun shines, Clouds rain,<br />    Train whistles blow and guitars play,<br />    Preachers preach, farmers plow,<br />    Wishes go up and the world goes round.</p>
<p>    And I love you, It just come natural,<br />    It just comes natural.<br />    Seasons change, Rivers wind.<br />    Tumble weeds roll and the stars shine.<br />    Wind howls, dawn breaks<br />    Cowboys riding' time slips away.</p>
<p>    And I love you, It just come natural,<br />    It's what I was born to do,<br />    Don't have to think it through,<br />    Baby, it's so easy loving you<br />    It just come natural.</p>
<p>    Fire burns, waves crash,<br />    Seeds grow and good things last,<br />    Ships sail, dreams fly,<br />    Night falls and full moons rise.</p>
<p>    And I love you, It just come Natural<br />    And I love you, It just come Natural<br />    It just come Natural<br />    It just come Natural</p>
<p>    Don Williams - Nobody, but you<br />    ==============================</p>
<p>    Who, by touching my hand<br />    Makes me understand, questions my heart is asking<br />    Who, opened my eyes, made me realise<br />    Love is everlasting</p>
<p>    Nobody but you, nobody but you<br />    Nobody else, could love me, like you do<br />    Nobody but you, could see me through<br />    Your love is true and I don't need nobody but you</p>
<p>    Who comes just close enough<br />    And shows me that love is nothing to be afraid of<br />    Who, holds me so tight every night <br />    And shows me what love is made of</p>
<p>    Nobody but you, nobody but you<br />    Nobody else, could love me, like you do<br />    Nobody but you, could see me through<br />    Your love is true and I don't need nobody but you</p>
<p>    Don Williams - Lay down beside me<br />    =================================</p>
<p>    I've spent my life looking for you<br />    Finding my way wasn't easy to do<br />    but I knew there was you all the while<br />    And it's been worth every mile</p>
<p>    So lay down beside me<br />    Love me and hide me <br />    Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away<br />    Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat<br />    And don't ever wander away</p>
<p>    Mornings and evenings all were the same<br />    And there was no music till I heard your name<br />    But I knew when I saw you smile<br />    Now I can rest for a while</p>
<p>    So lay down beside me<br />    Love me and hide me <br />    Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away<br />    Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat<br />    And don't ever wander away</p>
<p>    +++</p>
<p>    I can just go on ( or may be write about 1 song<br />  per week! )... one of <br />    my ambitions is to write a treatise on Cankam<br />  poetry and contemporary <br />    country music.</p>

<p>      Malathi, I totally accept your views.</p>
<p>      But one great thing about Sangam is it describes<br />  every small feeling<br />      lovers have.Young Kids of school though have<br />  access to internet and<br />      use to its maximum utility can never understand<br />  it , till they grow <br />    as<br />      an adult and experience something called love.<br />  The feelings are too<br />      subtle, one has to experience such kind of<br />  feelings to really<br />      appreciate the depth of the poem.</p>
<p>      The problem these days is every thing is so open<br />  the art of being<br />      subtle is totally missing, the fine line between<br />  being artistic and<br />      being gross is often crossed.</p>
<p>      No wonder every scholar who has read Sangam<br />  literature says the<br />      greatness of Sangam poetry has never been<br />  surpassed in this 2000<br />      years. The greatness of Sangam lies in its<br />  simple down to earth<br />      feelings.Probably this would be the only class<br />  of poetry in India<br />      which was so secular and concerned with lives of<br />  common people.</p>

<p>        Vairam, of course you need to be an adult to<br />        appreciate it fully. Books have changed a lot,<br />  i saw<br />        ninth grade text book it was quite unlike<br />  anything we<br />        learnt. On the other hand, these poems and<br />  stories in<br />        those days were subtle ways of educating<br />  growing<br />        children on adult realities, there was no<br />  television<br />        or internet in those days so pondering on what<br />  it<br />        means perhaps is a gentle way to waken the<br />  adult in a<br />        child and far less intrusive that modern<br />  methods :)</p>
<p>        My grandmother used to say the subtle<br />  practical<br />        intention behind young women chanting<br />  Tiruppavai (to<br />        get married soon) was similar, a gentle<br />  awakening of<br />        adult emotions mixed with devotional rasa,</p>

        <p>I may be late posting on this thread, but a few words<br />regardless. I believe Art in itself is a service to<br />God, it may or may not be religious in nature. Art<br />that comes from a place greater than one's self is<br />genuine and is itself born of God, it will survive<br />times to come. The reasoning behind that is that Art<br />is always born of the 'muse' or the 'mystery' rarely<br />out of the thinking mind. Even hard core atheists are<br />unable to explain the 'muse' other than that it is a<br />mystery from which great art is born.</p>
<p>Andal is a very dear and special person to devotees,<br />there is certainly no doubt about that. But when we<br />talk of art dispassionately Andal's pasuram, Ayanar or<br />any silpi's work, all are born out the same great muse<br />that is God, and it will survive time.</p>

<p>    Again, neenga conceptually different people<br />  comparison panaringa...<br />    Comparing Andal with Ayana chirpi is totally<br />  wrong.<br />    Andal, is an epitome of Bhakti or She is devotion<br />  itself. She, if I <br />    am allowed to say, is greater than Ranganatha<br />  himself. As with Valli, <br />    where it is said 'Kura magal iru patham paritha<br />  sekara', devotion has <br />    that respect with the greater spiritual plane.</p>
<p>    Ayana sirpi's love for sculpture is dazzled when<br />  sivakami is lost. <br />    Andal...Ranga is NEVER lost.</p>
<p>    In any form, Andal's poo malai or paa malai, never<br />  die with time, but <br />    Ayana sirpi may be lost in a few hundred years. <br />    Any art alone is mortal but lives longer than any<br />  human work, however <br />    art (poo malai - paa malai etc) devoted in the<br />  service of God, is <br />    immortal.</p>
<p>    I believe there is a vaishnava expert here to<br />  guide us on Andal, i am <br />    too small a being to talk of such a great bhaktai,<br />  even to think of <br />    her as human.</p>

<p>          Whether you see it as Kal/Kadavul/Kalai ...<br />  the sole reason the <br />        stone<br />          is placed in the museum is to respect the<br />  creativity of the<br />          GOD(sculptor) who created it.</p>
<p>          Regards,<br />          Vairam</p>
<p>        Hi vairam,</p>
<p>        A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt<br />  become god - <br />    meaning <br />        its is not treated as moolavar ( if in stone)<br />  or utsavar ( if <br />    metal) <br />        just like that.... there are a lot of<br />  proceedings ( ok - you may <br />        call it rituals) - which are performed to<br />  infuse the idol with <br />    the <br />        qualities that lift if from being a mere<br />  mortal creation to the <br />        plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats<br />  with regard to <br />    temple <br />        sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.</p>
<p>        as regards the god of man's creation and the<br />  man of god's <br />    creation - <br />        these are concepts that have spawned entire<br />  religions. the <br />    question <br />        of who is god is different from is God there.</p>
<p>        so what does god look like etc is for us to<br />  see within ourselves -</p>
<p>        to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are<br />  different schools <br />    of <br />        thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and<br />  beliefs - a <br />    fistfull <br />        of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a<br />  handful of clay. </p>
<p>        But the beauty in all this is the<br />  transformation was right in <br />    front <br />        of the eyes of the worshipper and once<br />  transformed the powers <br />    were <br />        deemed to be infused into the idol. this is<br />  the power of <br />    suggestion -<br />        but i would like to disagree on the sculpture<br />  being in a museum <br />        just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the<br />  eyes of the beholder <br />        and not the location. I can vouch of this<br />  personally - a year <br />    back i <br />        had such a profound experience - a chance<br />  visit to the singapore <br />        museum....reposting below</p>
<p>        We were greated at the entrance itself by a<br />  cut out of a chola<br />        bronze - an 11th C Uma Parameshwari. There<br />  were a couple of other<br />        chola bronzes ..incl one of Sambandar. There<br />  was also a beautiful<br />        stone sculpture of Subramaniar - chola era</p>
<p>        Unfortunately the piece de resistance - the<br />  Uma paramershwari idol<br />        was a special exhibit and the guards wouldnt<br />  allow us to take<br />        pictures of this one alone...</p>
<p>        The beauty of this piece was breathtaking -<br />  more than the aura of <br />        seeing the handiwork of agifted artist over<br />  1000 years ago - the <br />        sheer mastery ofcraftsmanship left us spell<br />  bound. statue was at <br />        best 2 feet in height, but the detailing was<br />  exqusite...the grace <br />        and calm of herface and love in the smile, the<br />  lovely locks of <br />    her <br />        hair fallinginto rolling tresses over her<br />  sholders..the intricate <br />        ornaments on his neck, the grace of her poise<br />  - the gentle sway <br />        acccentuating the narrow waist, the beautiful<br />  and elaborate work <br />    on <br />        his lower garments..her hands and fingers<br />  bring life to the <br />        figurine...it was the pure mixing of artistic<br />  beauty <br />=== message truncated ===</p></vj.episteme@></p></vairam@></p></ravi_eds@...></p></blockquote>

        <p>Vijay<br />Women and even other castes (other than Brahmins) wearing poonal was <br />prevalent, even until a few centuries ago. I saw a picture of a <br />sculpture of Goddess Meenakshi in a mandapam of the Madurai kovil <br />with poonal. (Apparently this part of the temple was built by the <br />Naiks, so the practice may have been prevalent even during Naik times)</p>
<p>Like many other rights, this one must have been denied women :-(<br />It would be a interesting study to find out why and how the practice <br />faded.</p>

<p>Taking your statement 1 step further, one is in awe of beauty of <br />stone sculpture<br />the verse is like a simmering fire, it comes back, until its purpose <br />is accomplished.

<p>Hi, I would not want to get into a debate on the feeling of the sirpi or devotee. But will definitely engage in a debate on the feeling their works excude....meaning the profound confluence of emotion that a stone sculpture evokes is universal....whereas despite the best of translations the beauty of the verse is restricted to the vocab n spiritual awakening of the reciter.</p>
<p>Pl bear in mind that great civilisations hv left edifices in stone that have stood the test of time ....machu peechu , the gizza plateau.....the colloseum in rome ..... Sometimes the edifices alone are left to speak...whereasothers though not leaving anything into stone....left behind indeligible memories....gengiz khan...a true legend ....without as much as a brick or verse left behind..... Take emdan for instance... Discount all her greatest achivements, her 15 min of chennai dock has etched her into our memory.</p>

<p>    Ravi,</p>
<p>    I think you have misunderstood my words. I agree that true Bhakthi <br />    is definitely above anything and everything. Like Vairam indicated <br />    clearly, look only at the simile. Just the uvamai. Andalukku inai <br />    Andal is very correct. But what I meant to say is that the Passion <br />    of Andal towards Ranganathar and the passion of Ayana siRpi towards <br />    his sculpture is same.</p>
<p>    Just take this for example. Thondaradippodi Azhwar says</p>
<p>    "pacchai mAmalai pOl mEni, pavaLa vAi kamalch chengaNN"</p>
<p>    Here he quotes the Green Mountain as an uvamai for the pleasing <br />  body <br />    of Ranganatha. Does this mean that the Mountain is higher than <br />    Ranganathan Himself? Or the Pavalam is greater than the Mouth which <br />    gave the Gita, or the Lotus is greater than the Eyes, with which He <br />    graces the world? They are just similes/uvamai. Similarly the <br />    Passion of Andal and Passion of Ayanar is just the same. OnRukku <br />    OnRu uvamai. Here the point of consideration is the passion and not <br />    the final objective. </p>
<p>    Trust I have clarified.</p>

<p>I understand clearly what your derivative is, my view however remains <br />the same.<br />Adding a drop of pure of bhakthi makes a whole different alchemy to <br />the process, hence the quality of output varies.<br />If Andal was just a poet or a priestess, her works (poo/paa malais)<br />can be compared to any normal human creator.</p>
<p>She is different. </p>

<p>  I think you have misunderstood my words. I agree that true Bhakthi <br />  is definitely above anything and everything. Like Vairam indicated <br />  clearly, look only at the simile.

But what I meant to say is that the Passion <br />  of Andal towards Ranganathar and the passion of Ayana siRpi towards <br />  his sculpture is same.</p>
<p>  Just take this for example. Thondaradippodi Azhwar says</p>
<p>  "pacchai mAmalai pOl mEni, pavaLa vAi kamalch chengaNN"</p>
<p>  Here he quotes the Green Mountain as an uvamai for the pleasing <br />body <br />  of Ranganatha. Does this mean that the Mountain is higher than <br />  Ranganathan Himself? Or the Pavalam is greater than the Mouth which <br />  gave the Gita, or the Lotus is greater than the Eyes, with which He <br />  graces the world? They are just similes/uvamai. Similarly the <br />  Passion of Andal and Passion of Ayanar is just the same. OnRukku <br />  OnRu uvamai. Here the point of consideration is the passion and not <br />  the final objective. </p>

<p>    Again, neenga conceptually different people comparison <br />panaringa...<br />    Comparing Andal with Ayana chirpi is totally wrong.<br />    Andal, is an epitome of Bhakti or She is devotion itself. She, if <br />  I <br />    am allowed to say, is greater than Ranganatha himself. As with <br />  Valli, <br />    where it is said 'Kura magal iru patham paritha sekara', devotion <br />  has <br />    that respect with the greater spiritual plane.</p>
<p>    Ayana sirpi's love for sculpture is dazzled when sivakami is <br />lost. <br />    Andal...Ranga is NEVER lost.</p>
<p>  May be true. But until the conclusion happened, i.e, losing <br />  sivakami, definitely Ayana siRpi's passion was the same as that of <br />  Andal. Only the end result can compared for quality. Otherwise the <br />  thought or passion in both is the same. It is only the strength and <br />  determination which was present in Andal is missing in Ayana siRpi. <br />  That does not mean that his passion, when exhibited, was impure.</p>
<p>    In any form, Andal's poo malai or paa malai, never die with time, <br />  but <br />    Ayana sirpi may be lost in a few hundred years. <br />    Any art alone is mortal but lives longer than any human work, <br />  however <br />    art (poo malai - paa malai etc) devoted in the service of God, is <br />    immortal.</p>
<p>  I beg to differ here. Here is where, the spirituality comes into <br />  fore. Nammazhwar says ".... un manathAl en ninaindhirundhAi ivaL <br />  thiRathu en seiginRAyE". This is one of the life lines of <br />  Vaishnavite Philosophy. This says that what ever happens in the <br />  world is due to Gods Sankalpam, i.e, His desire and determination. <br />  So if Andal's pA mAlai did not die with time, it is His grace, and <br />  if Ayana siRpi's sculpture is lost, it is also destined by Him. </p>
<p>  Atleast for now, both Andal's pAmAlai and Ayana siRi's kal malai <br />are <br />  co-existing. We do not know about the future. </p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</p>
<p>  PS: Andal's Poo malai, though is lost now. :-)  </p>
<p>    I believe there is a vaishnava expert here to guide us on Andal, <br />i <br />  am <br />    too small a being to talk of such a great bhaktai, even to think <br />  of <br />    her as human.</p>
<p>    -- R</p>
<p>  Ha Ha Ha, if this is intended towards me, I am no expert Ravi. I <br />  mean this. However, from an unbiased view point, especially when <br />you <br />  compare Andal and Ayana siRpi, I believe, they both had great <br />  passions on their objectives, only that Andal was more determined <br />  and the destiny favoured Her ("un manathAl en ninaindhirundhAi") <br />  while Ayana siRpi was less determined and so was his destiny. We <br />can <br />  easily compare the passion of both. Andal's passion made her go <br />  against the ritualistic practice of not adorning the garland, <br />before <br />  offering it to God, while Ayana siRpi's passion, made him mad, even <br />  to the extent that he struck a deal with the enemy of His king <br />  (Mahendravarman) who he respected so much. </p>
<p>  This is height of devotion. Not knowing what one does out of great <br />  devotion. Periyazhwar, father of Andal, incidentally describes this <br />  state of mind in his periyAzhwAr thirumozhi says "atthA ariyE endRu <br />  nAn azhaithAl, pithA enbar piRar..."</p>
<p>  Thirumangai Azhwar personifies this state of bliss, unmindful of <br />the <br />  worldly logics, that he even went to the extent of <br />performing "madal <br />  eduthal". Actually, madal eduthal, as per the Tamizh Ilakkiyams is <br />  ordained only for the male, who will wear a garland out of the palm <br />  leaf and sit on a Donkey and go around the town saying that the <br />  women he loves does not turn her eyes towards him. This is <br />something <br />  like emotional black mail. The reason I say that Thirumangai Azhwar <br />  went against the norm is that, he had sung the two <br />  prabhandhams "siRiya thirumaDal" and "periya thirumaDal" in nAyaki <br />  bhAvam, means, thinking of him as a women. So a women should not be <br />  doing this as per the customs prevalent in those times. But his <br />love <br />  for reaching God and the frustration that He is not showing up, <br />made <br />  him go well against the customs and rituals, prevalent at those <br />  times.</p>
<p>  So the Love, Devotion towards God are in one's thought and no <br />  customs and rituals can stipulate a boundary for these, when the <br />  jeevAtmA goes into a state of eternal bliss.</p>

<p>hi venkatesh</p>
<p>you are in chennai - pl go and have a look - its very difficult to <br />depict multiple tusks in sculpture - esp in the 5 rathas complex its <br />in straight profile....in saluvankuppam also two riders are shown in <br />front profile - only two tusks - and the riders have been eroded so <br />much that you can only make a faint outline.</p>
<p>sometime back, i had posted this on the famous airavatham<br />***********<br />I was visiting bkk last week and while on the road found an imposing<br />statue of a three headed elephant - the huge statue was called<br />Erawan and was outside the Erawan Museum. some more checking and<br />found that this is in fact our Iravatham..</p>
<p>as per thai literature aka their version of our Ramayana, Indra, a<br />graceful green-skinned god rode on a mountain-sized elephant named<br />Erawan. Erawan, the noblest of elephants was a magical gift from God<br />Shiva to God Indra. Lord Indra also has 2 other magical elephants,<br />Keereemeg Tridayuk and Eggatun, which were given to him by Lord<br />Brahma and Lord Vishnu respectively.</p>
<p>Erawan is said to be the most powerful of all. Described as<br />a hugh elephant with silvery white body of 33 heads, each head has 7<br />long ivory tusks. Each of his tusk is 16 million meters long, so<br />huge that it can house 7 large lotus ponds, within each tusk also<br />live thousands of angels and their servants.</p>
<p>Its quite rare to see the full version of Erawan elephant with 33<br />heads, instead, many artists prefer to draw Erawan as a 3 headed<br />elephant instead.</p>
<p>The Irrawaddy River in thailand is also named after Erawan</p>
<p>Indra's mount was the first elephant to emerge from the Garuda's<br />egg. Brahma had held the pieces of shell in his hands while singing<br />seven hymns and, led by Ayravana, 16 elephants manifested. The 8<br />females, the caryatids or supports of the world at each of the<br />points of the compass are named: Pundarika, Vamana, Kumudu, Anjana,<br />Pushpadanta, Sarvabhauma, Supratika and Aparanta.</p>
<p>The seven trunks of the white elephant in the golden yellow square<br />(the earth element) represent the seven minerals, seven negative and<br />seven positive qualities in man, seven forces in man, seven forces<br />in nature, seven principal substances in man (chyle, blood, flesh,<br />fat, bone, marrow, semen). Seven negative qualities: pride,<br />covetousness, lust , anger , gluttony, envy, and sloth.</p>
<p>you can find the workship of indra and airavatam among the temples <br />of ankor, prasat preau, siam reap.</p>
<p>also in a cave at Bhaja not far from Mumbai that was the site of a<br />Buddhist monastery around 200 BCE, there is a stone relief carving<br />showing Indra, king of the gods. He is seated upon Airavata [or<br />Ayravata] his elephant.</p>
<p>I remember in varalaru issue 7, in the topic Raja Rajisvaram -<br />Certain Revelations by Dr.R.Kalaikkovan</p>
<p>quote"The holy pilgrimage to Kailas in the climax of Sundarar’s<br />life. In that panel he is seen over the elephant called Iravatham"</p>

        <p>So this Parantaka was actually Parantaka II, that is Sundara Chozha, <br />right?? (Sorry that I thought it was Parantaka I). Then if the <br />inscription confirms this, then it is clear that during the times of <br />Thirumangai Azhwar Indira Vizha could have been much in practice, as <br />Thirumangai Azhwar is dated definitely before this period. </p>

<blockquote><p>  However, in mallai we do find several depictions of a deity riding <br />  an elephant - classified as either muruga or indra. Since skanda <br />is <br />  more prominently shown as a baby in the famous somasskanda panels, <br />  the elephant rider is surmised to be indra. </p>

        <p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>Thirumangai Azhwar, could not be considered as an authentic <br />information that it was prevalent during the times of Azhwar. <br />However if SPS sir can give the references to Parantaka, then it is <br />possible to conclude so.</p>
<p>The reason I say this is, the Azhwars, while talking of the <br />greatness of Kannan, they quote everything right from His childhood <br />to His going back to His own abode, Vaikuntham. So if this is the <br />only reference that we have during that time frame, then, this at <br />best, could be only a reference to the Indira Vizha conducted during <br />Kannan's time. However, Parantaka is considered to have lived more <br />closer to the times of Thirumangai Azhwar (what are their dates?). <br />So if any inscription of Parantaka confirms this as a contemporary <br />practice, then it is easy to conclude. </p>
<p>In the absence of this corroborating evidence, in my humble opinion, <br />it is difficult to conclude, just from Azhwar's Pasuram that the <br />Indira vizha was still in vogue during the Azhwar's times.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>
<p>PS: I expect Parantaka and Thirumangai Azhwar to be contemporaries <br />or atleast live very close in time to each other, only because, <br />tradidtionally he is considered as the last Azhwar. And during <br />Sundara Chozha's time, the Acharya lineage from Nathamuni starts. It <br />is natural to assume a time gap of 100 years atleast before <br />Nathamuni revived the Vaishnavism after Thirumangai Azhwar. Well I <br />agree that this could be easily contested. The above is only my <br />observation and I would stand corrected when some one points out to <br />the facts.</p>

<p>  Hi venkatesh,</p>
<p>  The stand that i am taking - or rather i had understood was Indra <br />  being a vedic God - was widely worshipped. as can be seen from <br />  reference in various literature incl silapathigaram.....But <br />  somewhere inbetween he lost prominence - i was of the opinion that <br />  the govardhana incident in krishna avatar (we have to accept that <br />in <br />  the context during krishna avatar - indra was a major deity and <br />  indra vizha was an imporant festival) is when the two gods clased <br />  and indra is shown as being outsmarted by the uplifted mountain of <br />  krishna - thereby proving the superiority. This exact story is <br />  sculpted into the mallai govardhana /krishna panel - pallava time. <br />  However, in mallai we do find several depictions of a deity riding <br />  an elephant - classified as either muruga or indra. Since skanda <br />is <br />  more prominently shown as a baby in the famous somasskanda panels, <br />  the elephant rider is surmised to be indra. </p>
<p>  Now, refer my post earlier - sps sir to assist, in providing the <br />  actual verse - during parantaka times - indra vizha was still on <br />  during his times.</p>

<blockquote><p>  If you ever wondered why Kamba Ramayanam(Ramavatharam) is <br />considered a<br />  better work than the original, you should have got an answer by <br />now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hi vairam - i had seen this similar posts somewhere - but not able <br />to remember whose - anyway, i had made a copy to refer later ( so <br />this is defn not mine)...but its a great read.</p>
<p>********quote************</p>
<p>In the Kamba Ramayana, the scene is painted very differently - to <br />me, it seems that the nature of Sita's ordeal is radically <br />transformed from being a demonstration of her purity to the public <br />to being a test of Rama's virtue as an avatar of god. </p>
<p>The first major difference is the dialogue between Sita and Rama. In <br />the Valmiki Ramayana, Sita responds to Rama's accusation by bursting <br />into tears and begging him to believe that she is pure and not like <br />lowly common women. But Rama refuses to relent, and she then <br />declares that if he suspects her conduct, she would rather die, and <br />she proceeds to ask Lakshmana to light a fire, into which she throws <br />herself. </p>
<p>In the Kamba Ramayana, this is turned on its head. Rama's <br />accusations are much more bitter. He does not just accuse Sita of <br />unchastity, he goes on to say that by her acts, she has single-<br />handedly caused womanhood (&#2986;&#3014;&#2979;&#3021;&#2990;&#3016;), greatness (&#2986;&#3014;&#2992;&#3009;&#2990;&#3016;), nobility <br />(&#2986;&#3007;&#2993;&#2986;&#3021;&#2986;&#3009;) and &#2965;&#2993;&#3021;&#2986;&#3009; to perish, like the glory of a king who has <br />abandoned generosity (&#2997;&#2979;&#3021;&#2990;&#3016;): </p>

<p>He then says that any truly noble woman would have restrained her <br />senses and clothed herself with morality; and if blame had befallen <br />her, she would cleanse it with her life, if needed. </p>

<p>There is no point going on. Her acts beggar belief. The proper thing <br />for her to do will be to die, or to leave and go away. </p>

<p>To this, Sita responds to Rama not with tears and lamentation, as in <br />Valmiki, but with anger. She does not try to excuse herself; instead <br />she throws his words back at him and accuses him of betrayal and <br />coldness of heart. Her words are filled with fury and sarcasm. She <br />speaks bitterly, and with righteous outrage. She says that she was a <br />fool for protecting her chastity.

<p>In Valmiki, when Sita jumps into the fire the gods appear and tell <br />Rama that he is Vishnu and Sita is Lakshmi, that they were born to <br />kill Ravana, and that he has now accomplished this. Sita emerges <br />unscathed, proving her purity, and Rama assures her that he never <br />doubted her, that it was in order to prove her purity to the world. </p>
<p>This is radically changed by Kambar. When Sita jumps into the fire, <br />her &#2965;&#2993;&#3021;&#2986;&#3009; is so strong that, much like a flame burns cotton, she <br />scorches the fire: </p>

<p>Far from protecting her from the fire as he does in Valmiki, Agni <br />himself is forced to flee the fire, howling in distress, while Sita <br />stands in the fire, unaffected by the flames: </p>

<p>Agni then challenges Rama, and condemns Rama's actions in extremely <br />strong terms: "Did you not hear the gods, the sages, all that moves, <br />all that is still, in the three worlds, strike their eyes and cry <br />out? Have you decided to destroy aram, and replace it with <br />wrongdoing?" </p>

<p>Agni continues: "Will the rains continue to fall? Will the earth <br />bear the burden without shattering? Will aram proceed along the <br />straight path? Will the world survive, if she becomes angry? On her <br />curse, even He who dwells on a flower will die." </p>
<p>&#2986;&#3014;&#2991;&#3021;&#2991;&#3009;&#2990;&#3015; &#2990;&#2996;&#3016;? &#2986;&#3009;&#2997;&#3007; &#2986;&#3007;&#2995;&#2986;&#3021;&#2986;&#2980;&#3009; &#2949;&#2985;&#3021;&#2993;&#3007;&#2991;&#3015; <br />&#2970;&#3014;&#2991;&#3021;&#2991;&#3009;&#2990;&#3015;, &#2986;&#3018;&#2993;&#3016;? &#2949;&#2993;&#2990;&#3021; &#2984;&#3014;&#2993;&#3007;&#2991;&#3007;&#2994;&#3021; &#2970;&#3014;&#2994;&#3021;&#2994;&#3009;&#2990;&#3015;? <br />&#2953;&#2991;&#3021;&#2991;&#3009;&#2990;&#3015; &#2953;&#2994;&#2965;&#3009; &#2951;&#2997;&#2995;&#3021; &#2953;&#2979;&#2992;&#3021;&#2997;&#3009;&#2970;&#3008;&#2993;&#3007;&#2985;&#3006;&#2994;&#3021;? <br />&#2997;&#3016;&#2991;&#3009;&#2990;&#3015;&#2994;&#3021;, &#2990;&#2994;&#2992;&#3021;&#2990;&#3007;&#2970;&#3016; &#2949;&#2991;&#2985;&#3009;&#2990;&#3021; &#2990;&#3006;&#2991;&#3009;&#2990;&#3015;. </p>
<p>Rama is thus forced to admit that he is wrong. "You are the <br />indestructible witness", he says to Agni, "and you have also, in <br />words that I cannot condemn, said that there is no fault on her. As <br />she is blameless, I cannot cast her aside as I have done." </p>

<p>As you can see, this is a very different treatment of Sita. She does <br />not try to excuse herself or appeal to Rama's feelings. Instead, she <br />speaks to Rama as an equal, and flings his taunts and accusations <br />right back at him (there is a striking parallel between the words <br />she uses and the words he uses, but this post would become way too <br />long if I started going into that). In the end, there is nothing she <br />has had to prove - at the end of the scene, it is Rama who must <br />ultimately bear the blame. </p>
<p>A few points: </p>
<p>- The repeated references to Sita's karpu, especially its <br />juxtaposition with the imagery of fire, is clearly intended to call <br />Kannagi in the Cilappadhikaram to mind. To make this even more <br />explicit, Sita is at one stage called "pattini" - which is the name <br />under which Kannagi was worshipped in ancient Tamil Nadu (and <br />continues to be in Sri Lanka). This represents a strikingly <br />different attitude to Sita - and to what her entry into the fire <br />represents - than that of the Valmiki Ramayana. </p>
<p>- In Valmiki, the accusations of injustice against Rama are <br />countered by a long self-justificatory speech where Rama insists <br />that he never suspected Sita. This is not present in the Kamba <br />Ramayana. No attempt is made to excuse Rama's actions, nor to <br />counter-balance the strong condemnation of Agni's words. In fact, <br />Rama is starkly silent after he admits that he has done wrong by <br />Sita. </p>
<p>- Unlike the Valmiki Ramayana, it is only after Rama admits his <br />error that the gods appear to tell him he is really Vishnu. It is <br />only after that that "the time is right to tell Rama who he is". </p>
<p>Kambar was writing within the Tamil devotional tradition. As anyone <br />who's read the works of the azhwars or nayanmars knows, it is quite <br />customary in Tamil devotional literature to criticise God - even <br />condemn him - for letting his devotees suffer. Valmiki, however, was <br />writing a religious epic within the Sanskritic tradition, where more <br />deference was expected to be shown to the divine - and, indeed, the <br />divine's favour was a devotee had to strive for and earn - unlike <br />the Tamil tradition where the gods were seen as having something of <br />a duty to ensure the welfare of the people, almost like the kings of <br />the sangam literature. This entire section is replete with puram and <br />akam imagery. </p>

<p>Hi venkatesh,</p>
<p>The stand that i am taking - or rather i had understood was Indra <br />being a vedic God - was widely worshipped. as can be seen from <br />reference in various literature incl silapathigaram.....But <br />somewhere inbetween he lost prominence - i was of the opinion that <br />the govardhana incident in krishna avatar (we have to accept that in <br />the context during krishna avatar - indra was a major deity and <br />indra vizha was an imporant festival) is when the two gods clased <br />and indra is shown as being outsmarted by the uplifted mountain of <br />krishna - thereby proving the superiority. This exact story is <br />sculpted into the mallai govardhana /krishna panel - pallava time. <br />However, in mallai we do find several depictions of a deity riding <br />an elephant - classified as either muruga or indra. Since skanda is <br />more prominently shown as a baby in the famous somasskanda panels, <br />the elephant rider is surmised to be indra. </p>
<p>Now, refer my post earlier - sps sir to assist, in providing the <br />actual verse - during parantaka times - indra vizha was still on <br />during his times.</p>

        <p>When u said about Kanden seethayai.... I remebered about a blog which<br />i posted earlier...I am posting it here</p>
<p>Original Tamil verse in my blog,<br /><a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/ramavatharam/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/ramavatharam/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/ramavatharam/</a></p>
<p>"I saw</p>
<p>the jewel of chastity</p>
<p>with these eyes</p>
<p>in Lanka ,the southern city</p>
<p>set in swaying ocean of clear waves!</p>
<p>O Lord of gods!</p>
<p>Banish all doubt now</p>
<p>and all past suffering!</p>
<p>so said Hanuman”</p>
<p>Translated by Kamil Zvelebil</p>
<p>This one of the greatest verses to show Kamban’s intelligence .</p>
<p>The situation is Rama is very anxious and impatient to hear news about<br />Sita.</p>
<p>Hanuman assessing the situation utters first word as கண்டனென் ‘I saw’,<br />hence clarifying anxious Rama that he did see Sita.</p>
<p>The next couple of words Hanuman utters are கற்பினுக்கு அணியை ‘the jewel<br />of chastity’ , now he clears doubts Rama has about Sita’s Chastity i.e<br />whether she is safe , unharmed and faithful.</p>
<p>Finally he says கண்களால் ‘with (my) eyes’ to clarify any remaining doubt<br />in Rama’s mind.</p>
<p>This shows the Psychological depth with which Kampan has analysed the<br />situation and has given a beautiful verse for the situation.</p>
<p>If you ever wondered why Kamba Ramayanam(Ramavatharam) is considered a<br />better work than the original, you should have got an answer by now.</p>

<p>  Have you guys come across some good western country music ? I guess <br />  you both are based in the US... Most of these songs carry this tender <br />  feeling in utterly simple words. Lets sample a few songs here, if you <br />  have the patience to read:</p>
<p>  George Strait - It just comes natural<br />  ====================================</p>
<p>  Sun shines, Clouds rain,<br />  Train whistles blow and guitars play,<br />  Preachers preach, farmers plow,<br />  Wishes go up and the world goes round.</p>
<p>  And I love you, It just come natural,<br />  It just comes natural.<br />  Seasons change, Rivers wind.<br />  Tumble weeds roll and the stars shine.<br />  Wind howls, dawn breaks<br />  Cowboys riding' time slips away.</p>
<p>  And I love you, It just come natural,<br />  It's what I was born to do,<br />  Don't have to think it through,<br />  Baby, it's so easy loving you<br />  It just come natural.</p>
<p>  Fire burns, waves crash,<br />  Seeds grow and good things last,<br />  Ships sail, dreams fly,<br />  Night falls and full moons rise.</p>
<p>  And I love you, It just come Natural<br />  And I love you, It just come Natural<br />  It just come Natural<br />  It just come Natural</p>
<p>  Don Williams - Nobody, but you<br />  ==============================</p>
<p>  Who, by touching my hand<br />  Makes me understand, questions my heart is asking<br />  Who, opened my eyes, made me realise<br />  Love is everlasting</p>
<p>  Nobody but you, nobody but you<br />  Nobody else, could love me, like you do<br />  Nobody but you, could see me through<br />  Your love is true and I don't need nobody but you</p>
<p>  Who comes just close enough<br />  And shows me that love is nothing to be afraid of<br />  Who, holds me so tight every night <br />  And shows me what love is made of</p>
<p>  Nobody but you, nobody but you<br />  Nobody else, could love me, like you do<br />  Nobody but you, could see me through<br />  Your love is true and I don't need nobody but you</p>
<p>  Don Williams - Lay down beside me<br />  =================================</p>
<p>  I've spent my life looking for you<br />  Finding my way wasn't easy to do<br />  but I knew there was you all the while<br />  And it's been worth every mile</p>
<p>  So lay down beside me<br />  Love me and hide me <br />  Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away<br />  Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat<br />  And don't ever wander away</p>
<p>  Mornings and evenings all were the same<br />  And there was no music till I heard your name<br />  But I knew when I saw you smile<br />  Now I can rest for a while</p>
<p>  So lay down beside me<br />  Love me and hide me <br />  Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away<br />  Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat<br />  And don't ever wander away</p>

<p>    Malathi, I totally accept your views.</p>
<p>    But one great thing about Sangam is it describes every small feeling<br />    lovers have.Young Kids of school though have access to internet and<br />    use to its maximum utility can never understand it , till they grow <br />  as<br />    an adult and experience something called love. The feelings are too<br />    subtle, one has to experience such kind of feelings to really<br />    appreciate the depth of the poem.</p>
<p>    The problem these days is every thing is so open the art of being<br />    subtle is totally missing, the fine line between being artistic and<br />    being gross is often crossed.</p>
<p>    No wonder every scholar who has read Sangam literature says the<br />    greatness of Sangam poetry has never been surpassed in this 2000<br />    years. The greatness of Sangam lies in its simple down to earth<br />    feelings.Probably this would be the only class of poetry in India<br />    which was so secular and concerned with lives of common people.</p>

<p>      Vairam, of course you need to be an adult to<br />      appreciate it fully. Books have changed a lot, i saw<br />      ninth grade text book it was quite unlike anything we<br />      learnt. On the other hand, these poems and stories in<br />      those days were subtle ways of educating growing<br />      children on adult realities, there was no television<br />      or internet in those days so pondering on what it<br />      means perhaps is a gentle way to waken the adult in a<br />      child and far less intrusive that modern methods :)</p>
<p>      My grandmother used to say the subtle practical<br />      intention behind young women chanting Tiruppavai (to<br />      get married soon) was similar, a gentle awakening of<br />      adult emotions mixed with devotional rasa,</p>

<p>        Hi,<br />        All the Tamil books are online now in PDF<br />        format...somebody sent me<br />        a link recently. So people who want to relook Tamil<br />        can start from 1st<br />        Std. Text book!....<br />        When I was in Second std I had a lesson called<br />        Kayalvili...it<br />        explains her getting up, brushing, bathing,eating,<br />        going to school and<br />        whole day routine...flash back rewind panalam nu<br />        tried looking into<br />        second std book but unfortunately portions have<br />        changed!<br />        Some how I feel you need to be an adult and<br />        should learn the<br />        meaning on your own to understand most of the Akam<br />        poems. The emotions<br />        and allusions cannot be surely understood when you<br />        are kid and a<br />        teacher who takes care that you really dont<br />        understand the intended<br />        allusions! :D ....</p>

<p>            This poem has an openly erotic allusion to it.<br />        The<br />            last lines express<br />            the desperate desire of the Hero to make love<br />        to<br />            his women.</p>

<p>  Again, neenga conceptually different people comparison panaringa...<br />  Comparing Andal with Ayana chirpi is totally wrong.<br />  Andal, is an epitome of Bhakti or She is devotion itself. She, if I <br />  am allowed to say, is greater than Ranganatha himself. As with Valli, <br />  where it is said 'Kura magal iru patham paritha sekara', devotion has <br />  that respect with the greater spiritual plane.</p>
<p>  Ayana sirpi's love for sculpture is dazzled when sivakami is lost. <br />  Andal...Ranga is NEVER lost.</p>
<p>  In any form, Andal's poo malai or paa malai, never die with time, but <br />  Ayana sirpi may be lost in a few hundred years. <br />  Any art alone is mortal but lives longer than any human work, however <br />  art (poo malai - paa malai etc) devoted in the service of God, is <br />  immortal.</p>
<p>  I believe there is a vaishnava expert here to guide us on Andal, i am <br />  too small a being to talk of such a great bhaktai, even to think of <br />  her as human.</p>

I spoke more in <br />  terms<br />    of the thought process of the sculpture.. though there might be so<br />    many procedures before installing a sculpture as god...the creator <br />  of<br />    the idol would have had immense pleasure while he created it..<br />    Very similar thought process like Andal had ...happiness that the<br />    garland she had woven would be used to decorate the lord...<br />    Even till day you will see people happy when the garland they <br />  bring<br />    is used to decorate the lord in the temple.<br />    I spoke about simple emotions/happiness that people have and what<br />    kind of happiness sculptor would have had when he knows the idol he <br />  is<br />    sculpting is going to be installed in a temple.</p>

<p>        Whether you see it as Kal/Kadavul/Kalai ... the sole reason the <br />      stone<br />        is placed in the museum is to respect the creativity of the<br />        GOD(sculptor) who created it.</p>
<p>        Regards,<br />        Vairam</p>
<p>      Hi vairam,</p>
<p>      A stone that is sculpted by a sculptor doesnt become god - <br />  meaning <br />      its is not treated as moolavar ( if in stone) or utsavar ( if <br />  metal) <br />      just like that.... there are a lot of proceedings ( ok - you may <br />      call it rituals) - which are performed to infuse the idol with <br />  the <br />      qualities that lift if from being a mere mortal creation to the <br />      plane where it becomes fit for worship. Thats with regard to <br />  temple <br />      sculpture - its an entire subject by itself.</p>
<p>      as regards the god of man's creation and the man of god's <br />  creation - <br />      these are concepts that have spawned entire religions. the <br />  question <br />      of who is god is different from is God there.</p>
<p>      so what does god look like etc is for us to see within ourselves -</p>
<p>      to focus our thoughts, to look inwards etc are different schools <br />  of <br />      thought. ultimately it all comes to faith and beliefs - a <br />  fistfull <br />      of turmeric becomes ganesha - so too does a handful of clay. </p>
<p>      But the beauty in all this is the transformation was right in <br />  front <br />      of the eyes of the worshipper and once transformed the powers <br />  were <br />      deemed to be infused into the idol. this is the power of <br />  suggestion -<br />      but i would like to disagree on the sculpture being in a museum <br />      just to honor the craftsmen - its all in the eyes of the beholder <br />      and not the location. I can vouch of this personally - a year <br />  back i <br />      had such a profound experience - a chance visit to the singapore <br />      museum....reposting below</p>
<p>      We were greated at the entrance itself by a cut out of a chola<br />      bronze - an 11th C Uma Parameshwari. There were a couple of other<br />      chola bronzes ..incl one of Sambandar. There was also a beautiful<br />      stone sculpture of Subramaniar - chola era</p>
<p>      Unfortunately the piece de resistance - the Uma paramershwari idol<br />      was a special exhibit and the guards wouldnt allow us to take<br />      pictures of this one alone...</p>
<p>      The beauty of this piece was breathtaking - more than the aura of <br />      seeing the handiwork of agifted artist over 1000 years ago - the <br />      sheer mastery ofcraftsmanship left us spell bound. statue was at <br />      best 2 feet in height, but the detailing was exqusite...the grace <br />      and calm of herface and love in the smile, the lovely locks of <br />  her <br />      hair fallinginto rolling tresses over her sholders..the intricate <br />      ornaments on his neck, the grace of her poise - the gentle sway <br />      acccentuating the narrow waist, the beautiful and elaborate work <br />  on <br />      his lower garments..her hands and fingers bring life to the <br />      figurine...it was the pure mixing of artistic beauty with <br />      spirituality - the experience left me spell bound - which is what <br />      the original chola patrons would have wanted the image to do...</p>
<p>      this is the image...</p>

<p>      Hi ravi,</p>
<p>      Andaal verses were immortalised in mallai ( kudavoil balu sir <br />had <br />      written a superb article on this - the govardana panel in <br />mallai) -</p>
<p>      i was writing about this in another forum ( i will save the <br />    pictures <br />      in the photos section) - this is a comaprison between the <br />varaha <br />      images in udayagiri n mallai. </p>
<p>      I was always fasinated by so many depictiond of this scene n <br />had <br />      wrongly surmised that canons for such sculpture was not <br />existent <br />      then. For eg, in mallai varaha panel - you will see the devi <br />      lovingly placed on the lords thighs - if you really watch <br />closely <br />      you will see that her upper garment has come loose and is <br />lying on <br />      her right leg ...and her face is slightly bent to the right ( <br />      depiction of shyness) and the the lord is lovingly embracing <br />    mother <br />      earth (ok since we are talking of mature subjects here - he is <br />      actually nuzzling her ......)....but in udayagiri she is shown <br />as <br />      dangling from his tusks......</p>
<p>      It was only after i read andaals verses that I realised both <br />were <br />      correct......just that they were two acts of the same story</p>
<p>      Aandaal had ..... Fallen in love with the lord n composed some <br />of <br />      the very open verses of love</p>
<p>      She sings thus.... </p>

<p>Just for the records, it is not sung by Andal, but by Nammazhwar.</p>

        <p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>Thanks for the understanding.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right here. That is why I did mention that, I am <br />not against rituals. But saying that only the rituals make a stone <br />become God, is something I am unable to digest, as for me, <br />the "thamar ugandhadhu" pAsuram is more appealing. </p>
<p>As you correctly pointed out, all these are various steps towards <br />realising one's true self and hence march towards the ultimate <br />reality that is God.</p>

<p>    Again another well said sentence and I was meaning this too <br />above. <br />    While I am not greater authority than you to certify you, I only <br />    wanted to substantiate these words, by providing certain <br />references <br />    to the spiritual scriptures. So please do not mistake me as I am <br />    trying to certify you.</p>

<p>  hi venkatesh</p>
<p>  you are welcome - we are all learning and thanks for those <br />extensive <br />  works. but one thing you need to know is that when you talk of <br />alwars <br />  and nayanmaars - these were special people - they had already <br />reached <br />  a plane - a divine sublime state - where they could see the <br />  manifestations of the lords in everything. </p>
<p>  But to the common man he needed more tools and had to led on the <br />path -<br />  temples, worship, rituals, the mantras - are all tools that help <br />the <br />  not so endowed common man to see the higher light - to help him <br />  focus... its akin to a walker ( toy) for a baby or training wheels <br />for <br />  a novice cycle learner - at first you just cant do without the <br />  supports, but once you have mastered the craft - you dont need <br />them. </p>
<p>  The concept of a hindu temple, its construction, placement of <br />idols - <br />  every slab, every elevation - has a meaning - they are there for a <br />  purpose and the purpose is to help you attain the best state to <br />  experience god. </p>
