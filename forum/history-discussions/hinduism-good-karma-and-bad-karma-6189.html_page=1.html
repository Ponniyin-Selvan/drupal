        <p>People,</p>
<p>How many in our group have read Vyasar Virundhu (Rajaji's Mahabharatha) He<br />covers everything in the Mahabharatha and the beauty is that it is crisp /<br />small as a capsule. All the discussions that are happening now - Janemejaya<br />/ Vaishampayana all these feature in the first chapter of Rajaji's<br />Mahabharata. This book you can finish it in a weekend session. This is<br />regarding my favorite Mahabharatha Book.</p>
<p>Coming to Udankar's appearance in Mahabharata (Not me, but the Maharishi.<br />But I am using the same spelling which I use in my official records) Guess<br />its time for me to re-read the Mahabharat again. I remember the incident<br />when Mahavishnu meets Udankar Maharishi in the Kurushetra region,<br />post Kurushetra war and why the rain clouds in the deserts are called<br />"Udanga Mehangal" But this "Pidi Sabham" to Krishna I can't recollect. My<br />gut feel is that, it may not be Udankar Maharishi as he happens to be a<br />staunch devotee of Mahavishnu and how can he curse an Avatar of Mahavishnu!</p>
<p>Opening up one more more pandora box ... If you go by the ISKCON idea Its<br />Krsna who is supreme not Vishnu. Vishnu is considered as an incarnation of<br />Krsna, not the other way round as we read. People who are from ISKCON can<br />throw more light on this.</p>
<p>~ Udanx @ Udankar<br />-- <br />"Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more<br />difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment."<br />-- Benjamin Franklin</p>

        <p>I am no expert like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym , Ravi et al.</p>
<p>Just trying to put forth what I understand.</p>
<p>The first step of bondage of the self is to think that we are not<br />free. The atman is free and till we recognize it we are caught in the<br />samsara sagaram. This is because we attribute every action to 'I',<br />thinking that I am doing this, I am doing that. This 'I' is the cause<br />of Karma. Once we relinquish this 'I' and do our duty, then we are not<br />bound by karma. Very difficult to realize and attain this and trying<br />to do things without expecting results is the first step of karmayoga.</p>
<p>Easiest way is bakthi yoga, where we surrender to the God saying<br />everything is yours, whatever I do is because of you. When we come to<br />this state,as <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym  referred as 'willing slaves', then we dont take<br />responsibility of our actions, and slowly the 'I' in us will be<br />dissolved and we can be free. Till then, yes, there is no free will<br />but the struggle of life is only to be free.</acronym></p>
<p>There is nothing called wrong or right in this world. There is only<br />'sathya', and if we say someone is doing a mistake, it means that they<br />are moving from a lower truth to higher truth to attain the ultimate<br />truth. So whatever we feel/do, let it be free will or slavery, nothing<br />is wrong as long as we try to move forward towards the ultimate sathya.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear V.Venkat,<br />  I followed your recent discussion with interest and thanks for your <br />  expalnations. ay I ask a question on the following sections:</p>
<p>    But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism Philosophy <br />    perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief on <br />    Him, is done by Him only. <br />  ................<br />    Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be so <br />    merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as the <br />    Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there would <br />    be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering the <br />    Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p>
<p>  Does this mean that we don't have any 'free will' at all?<br />  If that is the case, how do we accumulate our Karma in the first place?</p>
<p>  I thought that when we say 'All Thy Will' as all the <br />  Thevaaram/Thiruvaasagam/Paasurams are saying, it is an attitude of<br />mind to <br />  have, in order to surrender to Him and annhililate our Ego.</p>
<p>  I would be grateful for an explanation from your point of view.<br />  Thank you.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree that we have lost much of our great oral tradition. But times change, what we learn, where we learn, how we learn, everything has changed radically since the time of our ancestors. Atleast we had books, our children now have everything electronic. <br />?<br />In this particular context - The Mahabharat is a history/story, not like Vedas/Upanishads. You cannot memorize it, and unlike Valmiki Vyasa did not write poetry, he wrote a story only. Try telling a story from one person to another. It is like the chinese whisper game. It is impossible for it to be factually accurate.<br />?<br />Malathi<br />--- On Fri, 8/22/08, SatishKumar Arunachalam <satisharun@gmail.com  wrote:</p>

<p>Thats where we differ from our ancestors. Till the British came to<br />India and started documenting everything, the mode of education in<br />India was by sishya parampara. Guru teaches the sishya, sishya has to<br />memorize it, upside down,downside up and what not. In veda's we call<br />it gana padam.....repeating everything in the reverse order. Even<br />today we say thalai keezh paadam...thookathul a ezhupi ketalum theriyanum.</p>
<p>That was the quality of education we had and if that was the case,<br />just 100 years back, we are talking about nearly 5000 years where the<br />human mind would have been more clear to remember things.

        <p>Dear V.Venkat,<br />I followed your recent discussion with interest and thanks for your <br />expalnations. ay I ask a question on the following sections:</p>
<blockquote><p>  But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism Philosophy <br />  perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief on <br />  Him, is done by Him only. <br />................<br />  Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be so <br />  merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as the <br />  Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there would <br />  be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering the <br />  Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does this mean that we don't have any 'free will' at all?<br />If that is the case, how do we accumulate our Karma in the first place?</p>
<p>I thought that when we say 'All Thy Will' as all the <br />Thevaaram/Thiruvaasagam/Paasurams are saying, it is an attitude of mind to <br />have, in order to surrender to Him and annhililate our Ego.</p>
<p>I would be grateful for an explanation from your point of view.<br />Thank you.</p>
<p>Atpu.</p>

<p>  You said:<br />  ==================Quote========================<br />  That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of <br />  those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or <br />  anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to great <br />  hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel things <br />  happen cannot believe in a personal God many people do but these are <br />  just some challenges with that approach.<br />  ==================Unquote=======================</p>
<p>  You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people <br />  saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they <br />  encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there are <br />  indeed some who even stop believing in His existence. </p>
<p>  But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism Philosophy <br />  perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief on <br />  Him, is done by Him only. </p>
<p>  Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhaviruttham says,</p>
<p>  naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai, <br />  vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl, aRindhanan <br />  nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE</p>
<p>  Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of <br />  giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable of <br />  taking it back. So please do not do that(taking away your thoughts) <br />  to me. I know you!!! </p>
<p>  Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and <br />  anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is the <br />  sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.</p>
<p>  The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs that <br />  I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu..." and "kaNNanE <br />  kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".</p>
<p>  Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be so <br />  merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as the <br />  Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there would <br />  be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering the <br />  Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p>
<p>  This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences <br />  between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to <br />  Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by <br />  different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the <br />  visualisation of the Form (I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means Vishnu <br />  and Maan-Mazhu means Siva) when one tries to fit the God in the <br />  above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then Siva <br />  and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being. </p>
<p>  This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,</p>
<p>  thAzh sadaiyum (Siva) nIL mudiyum (Vishnu) oN mazhuvum (Siva) <br />  chakkaramum (Vishnu) sUzh aravum (Siva) pon nANum (Vishnu) thOndRum <br />  mAL. Here "mAl" refers to being Supreme. The Azhwars saw everything <br />  as "mAl". Just that they visualised Him that way. </p>
<p>  Which is why the saying "Ariyum Sivanum Ondru"</p>

        <p>Dear N Venkat, thanks for pointing out the errors. Yes Janemejaya was Arjuna's great grandson, not grandson. And Vaishampayana was Vyasa's disciple, not grandson. I wanted to say actually that all kauravas were really Vyasa'sgrandchildren as Vyasa really fathered Dhrithirashtra and Pandu.<br />?<br />Parikshit Kund or the site of Janemajaya's sacrifice still exists somewherenorthwest from what I know and the snakes there are harmless to this day.<br />?<br />Malathi<br />?</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym ,</p>
<p>Am entering the forum after quite some time, and really enjoying <br />your post. Great...</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "vinjamoor_venkatesh" <br /><vinjamoor_venkatesh@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Dear Sathish,</p>
<p>  Very valid questions. Just my two cents worth regarding the <br />reason, <br />  why Mahabali, inspite of being flawlessly virtuous, was pushed <br />  underground by Vishnu. This is a slightly confusing concept. We <br />need <br />  to see this carefully. </p>
<p>  Caveat: The reasoning that I am giving is based on the philosophy <br />of <br />  Thenkalai Sriaishnavites. I am not imposing my answer on others. <br />  Just an explanation based on one of the various perspectives of <br />the <br />  same happening.</p>
<p>  According to the Thenkalai Srivaishnavites, it is considered that <br />  all the actions are done by God Himself. Well, placing our beliefs <br />  on Karma theory, it will be difficult for many of us to accept <br />this. <br />  I was thinking in the same vein, until, I found a logic in it. (In <br />  fact I had asked that question to all as to how do you expect your <br />  God to be is with this logic in mind. So details of the logic, <br />  later) </p>
<p>  Nammazhwar says, <br />  1. OtthAr mikkArai ilayAya mA mAyan.<br />  2. eedum eduppum il Isan</p>
<p>  and many more such verses confirming that there is none equal to <br />or <br />  above Him. Now who can question someone for an action. Only if <br />that <br />  person is either equal or superior to the person being questioned. <br />  Isnt it? In this case as it is clear that there is none above Him, <br />  then who can question his acts? This aspect is called <br />  the "Parathvam" (meaning : being Supreme to everything and <br />everyone).</p>
<p>  -- Now logically, such a being will always have Unfettered <br />  Independence to act, as there is no one equal to and above Him. <br />  -- Again logically, such a being will be THE Master of the <br />Universe <br />  (the true He-man)<br />  -- When we say He is the Master of the Universe, then He naturally <br />  owns everything. So what we think of as ours, is not our actually, <br />  but His. This is what we say "what did WE bring when we were born, <br />  that we can carry it back when we are gone". </p>
<p>  Now with that prelude about the Philosophy, coming to Mahabali <br />  episode, Vishnu was very much pleased with Mahabali. Mahabali had <br />  all the best qualities in him. But there was a slight arrogance in <br />  him, when he said "I" will give you what ever you want. <br />  That "Ahankaram" was what a small blemish on his part for which <br />  Vishnu wanted to teach him a lesson. Hence He transformed Himself <br />  from a dwarf to limitless height and made Mahabali realise his <br />  fault. That is when Mahabali Surrenders at His feet and asks Him <br />to <br />  clean him (Mahabali) of the blemish of Arrogance. And Vishnu, puts <br />  his Lotus Feet on Mahabali's head and pushes him underground <br />asking <br />  him to be the ruler of Patala until the next Manvantara, when the <br />  Indra's post will be passed on to Mahabali. </p>
<p>  So in short that was not a punishment at all. It was the greatest <br />of <br />  the blessings. Again Thirumangai Azhwar beautifully explains this <br />  episode in his Periya Thirumozhi.</p>
<p>  ilagiya nIL mudi mAvalin than peru vELviyil, mANuruvAi muna nAL<br />  salamoDU mAnilam koNdavan.</p>
<p>  mANuru - the dwarf form<br />  salam - Deceive</p>
<p>  Yes Vishnu, indeed deceives Mahabali into getting the boon. But <br />what <br />  is the deception here. Is it just the fact that He first came as a <br />  dwarf and then while measuring took the largest form? No. Not at <br />  all. The answer is very interesting from a Logical Philosophy <br />point <br />  of view. The deception here is....</p>
<p>  As explained above, while actually, He (Vishnu) is the cause of <br />all <br />  the actions in the world, it means that He made Mahabali think <br />that <br />  the world was his (Mahabali's) while in reality it was His <br />  (Vishnu's). This is what is described as the deception. It is also <br />  said that this quality of Vishnu is very virtuous, in that, He is <br />so <br />  simple (Saulabhyam is the word that is used to describe this <br />  attitude. Saulabhyam -  Sulabhan - very simple).</p>
<p>  So that is the reason, from a Thenkalai Srivaishnvaite <br />philosophical <br />  standpoint, based purely on logic.</p>
<p>  Just remember the song from the film Marupadiyum,...... "nAyagan <br />  mElirundhu nUlinai AttugindrAn, nAmellAm bommai endru nAdagam <br />  kAttugindrAn.." </p>
<p>  and the very famous song in the movie Karnan sung by our dearest <br />  Sirgazhi Govindarajan </p>
<p>  "kaNNanE kAttinan, kaNNanE sAttinAn, kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".. </p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</p></blockquote>

        <p>Dear Malathi (Hope you are happy now!!!)</p>
<p>Call it Supreme Being or Supreme Energy - (thamar ugandhadhu eppEr <br />maRRappEr - Poigai Azhwar)<br />Call it as existant or non-existant - (uLan alan enil avan aruvam - <br />Nammazhwar)</p>
<p>This is the beauty of Hinduism. But pathetically, the Hinduism that <br />we see today is not what it was, as correctly pointed out by Vijay <br />earlier.</p>
<p>Personally, I dont see any difference between the Brahman that you <br />stated and the Supreme Being that I quoted, except the language <br />difference. I would say, whatever you name it, if the character of <br />what you call as Brahman matches with that of the Supreme Being that <br />I said, they are all one and the same. Only that, you call it <br />as "energy" and stop there. But when I try to attach a form to it, <br />remember that a form without energy is nothing. So even my <br />visualised God is having all the energy that you stated for the <br />Brahman.</p>
<p>This is where the harmony of Hinduism lies. You call the God by all <br />names and yet they all finally point out to only one. And most <br />importantly this God is full of Mercy and is Easy to Attain although <br />He is the Master. More logical definition of God isn't it?</p>

<p>the commonality in Shaivaite and Vaishnavite philosphies and also <br />beauty of hinduism lies in 'supreme being', yes that is one <br />perspective. There is also the perspective of Brahman which is more <br />on the lines of Supreme Energy rather than a big boss/supreme being. <br />Buddhism indirectly refers to the same Brahman although it does not <br />give it a form even as a non entity.</p>

<p>Ramana, Ramakrishna and so many others. Also as expounded by JK and <br />other non religious philosphers. The beauty of the energy is that it <br />is experiential even with a little effort with dyana/meditation and <br />therefore demands little effort on the part of the believer.Since <br />that energy is part of all of us it is refered to as 'Aham <br />Brahmasmi'.</p>

<p>  You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people <br />  saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they <br />  encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there <br />are <br />  indeed some who even stop believing in His existence. </p>
<p>  But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism <br />Philosophy <br />  perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief <br />on <br />  Him, is done by Him only. </p>
<p>  Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhavirutth am says,</p>
<p>  naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai, <br />  vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl, <br />aRindhanan <br />  nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE</p>
<p>  Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of <br />  giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable <br />of <br />  taking it back. So please do not do that(taking away your <br />thoughts) <br />  to me. I know you!!! </p>
<p>  Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and <br />  anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is <br />the <br />  sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.</p>
<p>  The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs <br />that <br />  I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu.. ." and "kaNNanE <br />  kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".</p>
<p>  Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be <br />so <br />  merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as <br />the <br />  Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there <br />would <br />  be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering the <br />  Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p>
<p>  This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences <br />  between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to <br />  Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by <br />  different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the <br />  visualisation of the Form (I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means <br />Vishnu <br />  and Maan-Mazhu means Siva) when one tries to fit the God in the <br />  above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then Siva <br />  and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being. </p>
<p>  This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,</p>

<p>    Dear V Venkat, first of all thank for you raising these <br />questions. <br />  Visualising God as human or non human is essentially the Dwaita <br />and <br />  Adwaita traditiions and how they are different. <br />    ?<br />    Let us face it, as young people everyone has a need to visualise <br />  God as human.

<p>    Dear Sivaraman,</p>
<p>    Please do not be apologetic. If you thought I got offended, I am <br />    definitely not. I respect others views very much. The reason I <br />  asked <br />    you the below question is different. Well, without making you <br />wait <br />    let me say what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>    There is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising the god in any <br />  form <br />    that one wishes. This is clearly stated by Poigai Azhwar. Am <br />sure <br />    there would be enough references with Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>    The pAsuram goes like this (I had already quoted this some time <br />  back)</p>
<p>    thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thanE<br />    thamar ugandhadhu eppER maRRappEr - thamar ugandhu<br />    evvaNNam imayAdhu sindhitthu irupparE<br />    avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm.</p>
<p>    Needless to explain this simple Thamizh, but for those who may <br />not <br />    know Thamizh, Azhwar says that, In whatever form one visualises <br />  Him, <br />    He presents Himself in that form. In whatever name one calls <br />Him, <br />  He <br />    accepts that name. Whichever form, the devotee gets attracted <br />  into, <br />    He takes that form.</p>
<p>    So with that, there is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising <br />Him <br />    as a human. </p>
<p>    But Vijay added wonderfully to it. Visualising as a Human is <br />just <br />    one thing. Only that, in the process, do not forget that He is <br />the <br />    Supreme Being and hence do not expect Him behave like some <br />(sorry <br />  to <br />    say this, but) stupid human. </p>
<p>    NammAzhwAr says.....</p>
<p>    paRRudai adiyavarkku eLiyavan, piRargaLukku ariya vitthagan.</p>
<p>    Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />    this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It <br />  is <br />    called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha <br />  visvAsam <br />    is the meaning for this "paRRu".</p>
<p>    So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely <br />nothing <br />    wrong in visualising Him in any form. </p>
<p>    Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram <br />or <br />    Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran <br />  behind <br />    it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side <br />  dish.</p>
<p>    Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum <br />veRRilai, <br />    parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one <br />  says <br />    that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there <br />anything <br />    inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences <br />by <br />    way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />    created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for <br />Him.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Venkat (please if you dont' mind can you drop 'Smt' makes me feel old),<br />?<br />I understand what you say on Thenkalai philosphy and I am no expert on Vaishnavite philosphies myself. However, I disagree that the commonality in Shaivaite and Vaishnavite philosphies and also beauty of hinduism lies in 'supreme being', yes that is one perspective. There is also the perspective of Brahman which is more on the lines of Supreme Energy rather than a big boss/supreme being. Buddhism indirectly refers to the same Brahman although it does not give it a form even as a non entity.<br />?<br />The Brahman is not a boss however benevolent we may want him to be. It is experiential energy as experienced by great saints such as Ramana, Ramakrishna and so many others. Also as expounded by JK and other non religious philosphers. The beauty of the energy is that it is experiential even with a little effort with dyana/meditation and therefore demands little effort on the part of the believer.Since that energy is part of all of us it is referedto as 'Aham Brahmasmi'.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>  Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />  this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It <br />is <br />  called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha <br />visvAsam <br />  is the meaning for this "paRRu".</p>
<p>  So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely nothing <br />  wrong in visualising Him in any form. </p>
<p>  Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram or <br />  Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran <br />behind <br />  it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side <br />dish.</p>
<p>  Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum veRRilai, <br />  parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one <br />says <br />  that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there anything <br />  inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences by <br />  way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />  created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for Him.</p>

<p>       Hi,</p>
<p>         Before I write some thing about this episode, can I humbly<br />      request<br />         all of you to come out with your thoughts and expectations <br />of <br />  how<br />         you visualise your God to be. I mean the character (GuNas) <br />and<br />      not<br />         whether He needs to sport, Sanku, Chakram, Mazhu, vAL, <br />Golden<br />         Kreetam, etc.</p>
<p>       Once, when I was conversing with my sister regarding a topic<br />      similar<br />       to this, she made this statement, "Visualizing God in Human <br />  form is<br />       the highest form of Human arrogance". It really made sense to <br />  me.</p>
<p>       regrds,<br />       siva.</p>
<p>         After your answers I will write more.</p>
<p>         Caveat: I am definitely not an authority on the subject. But<br />      would<br />         just like to know the feelings first hand, before I write<br />      anything.</p>

        <p>Interestingly Vyasa also appears in two Jataka tales, perhaps the only character to be shared with Buddhism. He is known as Kanyadipayana in Buddhism,from Dwaimpayana in Sanskrit. One tale is similar to the last parva of Mahabharat where yadava youths ridicule rishis for their clairvoyant powers bydressing a male as a pregnant woman and asking the gender of her unborn child. The angry rishis curse that a rod would be born?that would mean the end of their dynasty.?In the Mahabharat the rishis are Narada, Kanwa maharishi and Vishwamitra, in Jataka tale it is Vyasa.</p>

        <p>Also to remember the Mahabharat as written by Vyasa was related by his grandson Vaishampayana to Arjuna's grandson Janamejaya in the great 'sarpa yagna'. As I understand whatever we have now is the record of Vaishampayana's narration, not Vyasa's original. There fore 3 degrees of narration within the same epic it is wholly possible things were left out, added and so on.</p>

<p>Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>Very valid question. But I believe, as Vyasa was having the complete <br />knowledge of whatever was happening, it is he who documented even <br />Gita. </p>
<p>Other possibilities, like Arjuna or Sanjaya are ruled out. And no <br />need to expect Dridharasthra to document it. So it was Vyasa who, <br />like Sanjaya keeping track of the happening, documented it.</p>

          Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>You said:<br />==================Quote========================<br />That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of <br />those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or <br />anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to great <br />hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel things <br />happen cannot believe in a personal God many people do but these are <br />just some challenges with that approach.<br />==================Unquote=======================</p>
<p>You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people <br />saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they <br />encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there are <br />indeed some who even stop believing in His existence. </p>
<p>But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism Philosophy <br />perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief on <br />Him, is done by Him only. </p>
<p>Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhaviruttham says,</p>
<p>naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai, <br />vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl, aRindhanan <br />nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE</p>
<p>Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of <br />giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable of <br />taking it back. So please do not do that(taking away your thoughts) <br />to me. I know you!!! </p>
<p>Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and <br />anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is the <br />sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.</p>
<p>The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs that <br />I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu..." and "kaNNanE <br />kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".</p>
<p>Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be so <br />merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as the <br />Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there would <br />be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering the <br />Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p>
<p>This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences <br />between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to <br />Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by <br />different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the <br />visualisation of the Form (I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means Vishnu <br />and Maan-Mazhu means Siva) when one tries to fit the God in the <br />above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then Siva <br />and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being. </p>
<p>This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,</p>
<p>thAzh sadaiyum (Siva) nIL mudiyum (Vishnu) oN mazhuvum (Siva) <br />chakkaramum (Vishnu) sUzh aravum (Siva) pon nANum (Vishnu) thOndRum <br />mAL. Here "mAl" refers to being Supreme. The Azhwars saw everything <br />as "mAl". Just that they visualised Him that way. </p>
<p>Which is why the saying "Ariyum Sivanum Ondru"</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<blockquote><p>  ?<br />  Let us face it, as young people everyone has a need to visualise <br />God as human. It is impossible for a young and perhaps spiritually </p></blockquote>
<p>immature mind to conceptualise a God that is all pervading, spirit <br />form without a body. We call him super human to differentiate as you <br />nicely put from a 'stupid human'. There are some issues with this <br />approach. A 'super human' is not that different from a human <br />authority figure to the human mind. Those who have had positive <br />relationships with authority figures will be fine with this approach <br />and also with the stance that a 'super human' can do what 'He' likes <br />(as Sri Krishna did on many occasion) and I as a human just have to <br />assume it is His will. That is a great philosphy as long as I am not <br />subject to one of those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose <br />a child or anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to <br />great hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel <br />things happen cannot believe</p>
<blockquote><p>  in a personal God many people do but these are just some <br />challenges with that approach.<br />  ?<br />  The adwaitic spirit based God is just the all pervading spirit <br />that is in all and of all - the spirit does not have a human </p></blockquote>
<p>personality and it is a great mystery if It has a mind or a will <br />that works like human minds and human wills. The great part of this <br />belief system is that the spirit is experiential via dyana/mediation <br />and so much and those who have tasted that cannot possibly forget <br />it. The spirit approach is one that makes sense to atheists who <br />practice meditation and lot of agnostics too who are confused either <br />way.</p>

<p>  Dear Sivaraman,</p>
<p>  Please do not be apologetic. If you thought I got offended, I am <br />  definitely not. I respect others views very much. The reason I <br />asked <br />  you the below question is different. Well, without making you wait <br />  let me say what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>  There is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising the god in any <br />form <br />  that one wishes. This is clearly stated by Poigai Azhwar. Am sure <br />  there would be enough references with Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>  The pAsuram goes like this (I had already quoted this some time <br />back)</p>
<p>  thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thanE<br />  thamar ugandhadhu eppER maRRappEr - thamar ugandhu<br />  evvaNNam imayAdhu sindhitthu irupparE<br />  avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm.</p>
<p>  Needless to explain this simple Thamizh, but for those who may not <br />  know Thamizh, Azhwar says that, In whatever form one visualises <br />Him, <br />  He presents Himself in that form. In whatever name one calls Him, <br />He <br />  accepts that name. Whichever form, the devotee gets attracted <br />into, <br />  He takes that form.</p>
<p>  So with that, there is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising Him <br />  as a human. </p>
<p>  But Vijay added wonderfully to it. Visualising as a Human is just <br />  one thing. Only that, in the process, do not forget that He is the <br />  Supreme Being and hence do not expect Him behave like some (sorry <br />to <br />  say this, but) stupid human. </p>
<p>  NammAzhwAr says.....</p>
<p>  paRRudai adiyavarkku eLiyavan, piRargaLukku ariya vitthagan.</p>
<p>  Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />  this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It <br />is <br />  called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha <br />visvAsam <br />  is the meaning for this "paRRu".</p>
<p>  So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely nothing <br />  wrong in visualising Him in any form. </p>
<p>  Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram or <br />  Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran <br />behind <br />  it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side <br />dish.</p>
<p>  Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum veRRilai, <br />  parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one <br />says <br />  that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there anything <br />  inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences by <br />  way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />  created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for Him.</p>

<p>      So what would that mean? I mean, what is the better way of<br />      visualising God according to your sister? Answer to this would <br />  make<br />      the discussion more interesting.</p>

<p>       Hi,</p>
<p>         Before I write some thing about this episode, can I humbly<br />      request<br />         all of you to come out with your thoughts and expectations <br />of <br />  how<br />         you visualise your God to be. I mean the character (GuNas) <br />and<br />      not<br />         whether He needs to sport, Sanku, Chakram, Mazhu, vAL, <br />Golden<br />         Kreetam, etc.</p>
<p>       Once, when I was conversing with my sister regarding a topic<br />      similar<br />       to this, she made this statement, "Visualizing God in Human <br />  form is<br />       the highest form of Human arrogance". It really made sense to <br />  me.</p>
<p>       regrds,<br />       siva.</p>
<p>         After your answers I will write more.</p>
<p>         Caveat: I am definitely not an authority on the subject. But<br />      would<br />         just like to know the feelings first hand, before I write<br />      anything.</p>

<p>Malaakarar, by the way is a part of Krishna's story and not exactly <br />Mahabharata. Malakarar was a very poor person, who use to make <br />garlands for Krishna while He was a child in Gokulam. If I remember <br />right, while migrating from Gokulam to Mathura, Krishna asks <br />Maalakarar to ask for a boon and Maalakarar requests to show His <br />Viswaroopa form for which Krishna obliges.</p>

<p>Other possibilities, like Arjuna or Sanjaya are ruled out. And no <br />need to expect Dridharasthra to document it. So it was Vyasa who, <br />like Sanjaya keeping track of the happening, documented it.</p>

<p>.......God is present in the form of an archetypal trickster figure<br />asking Bali for his boon of destruction. Namuchi clings to Vishnu's<br />left leg in the left corner desperately trying to stall the design of<br />divinity but would be soon contemptuously flung away.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Now how Karma can be explained simple ?<br />Rat eats Frog - case 1.</p></blockquote>
<p>Karma -2 - (Possibly) frog is a eagle and rat is a snake<br />Karma -1 - Previous form of connection by two entities (rat and frog)<br />Karma 0 - Rat meets Frog<br />Karma 1 - intent of eating for scope of hunger.<br />Karma 2 - action of eating<br />Karma 3 - life of a frog<br />karma 4 - duty to sustain life of self(rat)<br />so on and so forth...</p>
<p>Actions to each of above, has a reaction, in sequential <br />fashion....for the rat.</p>
<p>Frog - Cycle begins as above.</p>
<p>Guru Arunagiri says</p>
<p>'Eruvai karuvai, thanile uruvai, ithuve thodarbai...veri pole'</p>
<p>Our energies hold on to the actions we perform, actions - i dont mean <br />just physical, the more powerful action is the touch of mind, unless <br />we recognize the value of action and understand that we do not <br />control even the <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym we breathe. Then the concept of surrender - <br />total begins to unbind the electro magnetic connection of the Spirit.</acronym></p>
<p>As with any theory, its easy to read and reproduce, now <br />practicals...is well...that's another story :-)</p>

There are some issues with this <br />approach. A 'super human' is not that different from a human <br />authority figure to the human mind. Those who have had positive <br />relationships with authority figures will be fine with this approach <br />and also with the stance that a 'super human' can do what 'He' likes <br />(as Sri Krishna did on many occasion) and I as a human just have to <br />assume it is His will.

<p>and it is a great mystery if It has a mind or a will that works like <br />human minds and human wills. The great part of this belief system is <br />that the spirit is experiential via dyana/mediation and so much and <br />those who have tasted that cannot possibly forget it.

<p>  Dear Sivaraman,</p>
<p>  Please do not be apologetic. If you thought I got offended, I am <br />  definitely not. I respect others views very much. The reason I <br />asked <br />  you the below question is different. Well, without making you wait <br />  let me say what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>  There is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising the god in any <br />form <br />  that one wishes. This is clearly stated by Poigai Azhwar. Am sure <br />  there would be enough references with Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>  The pAsuram goes like this (I had already quoted this some time <br />back)</p>
<p>  thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thanE<br />  thamar ugandhadhu eppER maRRappEr - thamar ugandhu<br />  evvaNNam imayAdhu sindhitthu irupparE<br />  avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm.</p>
<p>  Needless to explain this simple Thamizh, but for those who may not <br />  know Thamizh, Azhwar says that, In whatever form one visualises <br />Him, <br />  He presents Himself in that form. In whatever name one calls Him, <br />He <br />  accepts that name. Whichever form, the devotee gets attracted into, <br />  He takes that form.</p>
<p>  So with that, there is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising Him <br />  as a human. </p>
<p>  But Vijay added wonderfully to it. Visualising as a Human is just <br />  one thing. Only that, in the process, do not forget that He is the <br />  Supreme Being and hence do not expect Him behave like some (sorry <br />to <br />  say this, but) stupid human. </p>
<p>  NammAzhwAr says.....</p>
<p>  paRRudai adiyavarkku eLiyavan, piRargaLukku ariya vitthagan.</p>
<p>  Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />  this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It is <br />  called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha visvAsam <br />  is the meaning for this "paRRu".</p>
<p>  So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely nothing <br />  wrong in visualising Him in any form. </p>
<p>  Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram or <br />  Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran behind <br />  it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side dish.</p>
<p>  Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum veRRilai, <br />  parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one <br />says <br />  that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there anything <br />  inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences by <br />  way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />  created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for Him.</p>

<p>      So what would that mean? I mean, what is the better way of<br />      visualising God according to your sister? Answer to this would <br />  make<br />      the discussion more interesting.</p>

<p>       Hi,</p>
<p>         Before I write some thing about this episode, can I humbly<br />      request<br />         all of you to come out with your thoughts and expectations <br />of <br />  how<br />         you visualise your God to be. I mean the character (GuNas) <br />and<br />      not<br />         whether He needs to sport, Sanku, Chakram, Mazhu, vAL, Golden<br />         Kreetam, etc.</p>
<p>       Once, when I was conversing with my sister regarding a topic<br />      similar<br />       to this, she made this statement, "Visualizing God in Human <br />  form is<br />       the highest form of Human arrogance". It really made sense to <br />  me.</p>
<p>       regrds,<br />       siva.</p>
<p>         After your answers I will write more.</p>
<p>         Caveat: I am definitely not an authority on the subject. But<br />      would<br />         just like to know the feelings first hand, before I write<br />      anything.</p>

        <p>Dear V Venkat, first of all thank for you raising these questions. Visualising God as human or non human is essentially the Dwaita and Adwaita traditiions and how they are different. <br />?<br />Let us face it, as young people everyone has a need to visualise God as human. It is impossible for a young and perhaps spiritually immature mind to conceptualise a God that is all pervading, spirit form without a body. We call him super human to differentiate as you nicely put from a 'stupid human'. There are some issues with this approach. A 'super human' is not that different from a human authority figure to the human mind. Those who have had positive relationships with authority figures will be fine with this approach and also with the stance that a 'super human' can do what 'He' likes (asSri Krishna did on many occasion) and I as a human just have to assume it is His will. That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to great hatred against Him.Nowam not implying everyone who has cruel things happen cannot believe<br />in a personal God many people do but these are just some challenges with that approach.<br />?<br />The adwaitic spirit based God is just the all pervading spirit that is in all and of all - the spirit does not have a human personality and it is a great mystery if It has a mind or a will that works like human minds and human wills. The great part of this belief system is that the spirit is experiential via dyana/mediation and so much and those who have tasted that cannotpossibly forget it. The spirit approach is one that makes sense to atheists who practice meditation and lot of agnostics too who are confused either way.<br />?<br />Just a small practical attempt to explain. There are many appraoches that mix both of these too.</p>

<p>Dear Sivaraman,</p>
<p>Please do not be apologetic. If you thought I got offended, I am <br />definitely not. I respect others views very much. The reason I asked <br />you the below question is different. Well, without making you wait <br />let me say what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising the god in any form <br />that one wishes. This is clearly stated by Poigai Azhwar. Am sure <br />there would be enough references with Nayanmars too. </p>
<p>The pAsuram goes like this (I had already quoted this some time back)</p>
<p>thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thanE<br />thamar ugandhadhu eppER maRRappEr - thamar ugandhu<br />evvaNNam imayAdhu sindhitthu irupparE<br />avvaNNam AzhiyAnAm.</p>
<p>Needless to explain this simple Thamizh, but for those who may not <br />know Thamizh, Azhwar says that, In whatever form one visualises Him, <br />He presents Himself in that form. In whatever name one calls Him, He <br />accepts that name. Whichever form, the devotee gets attracted into, <br />He takes that form.</p>
<p>So with that, there is absolutely nothing wrong in visualising Him <br />as a human. </p>
<p>But Vijay added wonderfully to it. Visualising as a Human is just <br />one thing. Only that, in the process, do not forget that He is the <br />Supreme Being and hence do not expect Him behave like some (sorry to <br />say this, but) stupid human. </p>
<p>NammAzhwAr says.....</p>
<p>paRRudai adiyavarkku eLiyavan, piRargaLukku ariya vitthagan.</p>
<p>Yes He is so simple for those who are devoted to Him. And <br />this "paRRu" is not just devotion. Some thing more than that. It is <br />called "maha visvAsam". Yes surrendering to Him, with maha visvAsam <br />is the meaning for this "paRRu".</p>
<p>So.... what I intended to say was that there is absolutely nothing <br />wrong in visualising Him in any form. </p>
<p>Forget human form. We do have stories of where either Thukkaram or <br />Bhadrachalam Ramadass, saw Rama in the form of a Dog and ran behind <br />it, because it took away the Chappathi without taking the side dish.</p>
<p>Is this not the height of devotion? "uNNum sORu, thinnum veRRilai, <br />parugum nEEr, ellAm kaNNan" as said by Nammazhwar. And when one says <br />that the God pervades everything in the Universe is there anything <br />inferior for Him. May be, being humans, we can have differences by <br />way of inferior and superior. Definitely not for God, who has <br />created everything. There is nothing inferior or superior for Him.</p>

<p>    So what would that mean? I mean, what is the better way of<br />    visualising God according to your sister? Answer to this would <br />make<br />    the discussion more interesting.</p>

<p>     Hi,</p>
<p>       Before I write some thing about this episode, can I humbly<br />    request<br />       all of you to come out with your thoughts and expectations of <br />how<br />       you visualise your God to be. I mean the character (GuNas) and<br />    not<br />       whether He needs to sport, Sanku, Chakram, Mazhu, vAL, Golden<br />       Kreetam, etc.</p>
<p>     Once, when I was conversing with my sister regarding a topic<br />    similar<br />     to this, she made this statement, "Visualizing God in Human <br />form is<br />     the highest form of Human arrogance". It really made sense to <br />me.</p>
<p>     regrds,<br />     siva.</p>
<p>       After your answers I will write more.</p>
<p>       Caveat: I am definitely not an authority on the subject. But<br />    would<br />       just like to know the feelings first hand, before I write<br />    anything.</p>
