</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear friends<br />This one is quite interesting that I like to share with you all.<br />somasundaram</p>
<p>My Young Days in School</p>
<p>(This extract is from a Tamil book written<br />by Tamil Thatha, Dr. U. V. Saminathayyar named, “Yen Charithiram”)</p>
<p>In those days, the village school was<br />called “ Thinnai Pallikoodam “. The<br />system of learning was entirely different. All the boys have to arrive at the<br />school at 5 A.M. itself with their palm leaf (Panai Olai) “chuvadis”. All the<br />chuvadis are connected to a wooden piece of same size attached by means of a<br />string and tied. This is called “chuvadi thooku”. As soon as the boys arrive at<br />the school, they have to hang their chuvadi thooku in the walls and they have<br />to recite the lessons taught on the previous day loudly, taking turns. The<br />teacher would be inside the house (the school ) and would be listening to their<br />recitations.</p>
<p>After 6 A.M., all the boys go out to finish<br />their morning duties, bathe in the river or canal, wear their religious symbols<br />on their forehead and chant the necessary mantras/ slokas sitting on the river<br />bank. Then they will carry in their clothes sufficient quantity of clean sand<br />and come to the school. They will remove the sand already spread on the floor<br />on the previous day and spread the new sand in its place for writing purposes. Some<br />will write and some will read.</p>
<p>At 9 A.M., they will eat the rice which<br />they have brought along. This rice is called “Pazhayadhu”. Before eating, the<br />teacher will give each boy a blow with his cane in his palm. This is probably<br />to remind them that they are in the school and not in their house.</p>
<p>The teacher will appoint one boy as<br />“monitor”. He is normally a well built boy who has to control the other boys.<br />It is his duty not only to control but also listen to the recitations and note<br />the mistakes. Some boys try to earn his good-will by giving something to eat<br />from their homes.</p>
<p>After noon, the boys will go to their homes<br />for lunch and come back at 3 P.M.. The classes may extend up to 7 P.M. even.</p>
<p>Every day evening, the teacher will tell<br />each boy the name of either a flower or a bird, or an animal or a village and<br />he has to remember the name and tell the teacher correctly the next day. This<br />exercise is to improve the memory power of the boy.</p>
<p>Since the boys have to come to the school as<br />early as 5 A.M., they will be accompanied by some elders .If they come late,<br />they will get a cane beating on their palm. The first late arrival will escape<br />with a soft touch. However the subsequent arrivals will experience the ferocity<br />and frequency of beatings in increasing order. The boy who got a good beating<br />will probably be the first boy to arrive next day, even before time. The first<br />boy is called as a “Different One”(Vettran). Sometimes the joy of the first<br />person may be short lived because already there may be some one before him<br />lurking in the dark corner who indicates his presence by a cough.<br />For those boys, sand is the present day<br />written in the chuvadi by the teacher, the student will learn the alphabets<br />first, called as “Nedunkanakku”. Then he will learn numbers. The chuvadi in<br />which the teacher has written is called the Original Olai or “Chattam”.</p>
<p>The numbers and letters written in the<br />chuvadi are more visible if we apply either turmeric powder, or charcoal, or<br />Oomathai leaf juice. They also preserve the chuvadi.<br />Chuvadis are of different sizes. There will<br />be a hole in each chuvadi and a thread will be inserted into the hole to tie<br />them together. Blank chuvadis will be attached both in the front and back.</p>
<p>Yezhuthanis are of different types .e.g.<br />stout ones (gundu yezhuthani), pull types (vaaru yezhuthani), foldable ones<br />(madakku yezhuthani) etc.<br />For the pull types, there will be a<br />scabbard made up of palm leaf (panai olai). For the foldable ones, there will<br />be a handle made up of ivory, or horn, or wood.</p>
<p>When a boy begins to start reading a new<br />book (Nool),the process is called “Chuvadi Thuvakkal”. Before the teacher<br />starts a lesson from the “Nool”, that chuvadi will be placed before Lord<br />Pillaiyar after applying turmeric and pooja done, to invoke His Blessings.</p>
<p>On that day, the boy will bring a kind of<br />rice called “kaapparisi”, probably pounded rice (aval) mixed with coconut<br />pieces, jaggery and sesame from his home and it will be distributed to all the<br />boys. That day will be declared a holiday for the school. All the boys willbe<br />happy not because they are going to start reading a new book but because they<br />are getting a holiday and the accompanying snacks.</p>
<p>Further, there will be no school on New<br />Moon day, Full Moon day, Ashtami day, and Pirathamai day. These days are called<br />“Vaavu”, probably derived from the word “Uvaa” which means New Moon and Full<br />Moon.</p>
<p>Every student will bring daily, one gift<br />article and give it to the teacher. It can be either a fruit, or pancake or<br />firewood etc. On function days, they will bring whatever essential things<br />required for the same function in the teacher’s house. On holidays,they may<br />give money also.</p>
<p>Every month, the tuition fees for the<br />teacher is quarter of a rupee per head .Rich people may give annual requirement<br />of paddy. On special days, they may give other donations also. During<br />Navarathiri days, the students will get dressed up, sing songs, play “Kolattam”<br />etc. The teacher will take them to everybody’s house in the villageand make<br />them sing. Every household may give some donation and all such income will go<br />to the teacher. This income is called “maanamboo”. The word, “Maha Nonbu” has changed into this word. With this<br />income of “maanamboo” only, the teachers are able to conduct weddings in their<br />houses.</p>
<p>The teacher is also called “Kanakkayar”.<br />The village people always behave with respect. Whatever the teacher does tothe<br />boys, will never be questioned by them. Neither do they feel sorry. On the<br />other hand, mischievous boys are specifically entrusted to the teacher to be<br />set right.</p>
<p>All the childhood days are spent under the<br />control of teacher. Students will treat the teachers as if they were gods. They<br />during essential times will also do the household chores of the teacher.</p>
<p>In school, the students will tremble at the<br />prospect of receiving punishment from the teacher. Beating with cane is the<br />most common punishment. Sometimes, the boys are asked to hold a rope tied to a<br />rafter and hang for specified time. This punishment is called “Kothandam”.<br />Other times, the teacher may ask one boy to climb on the back of the errantboy<br />and he has to go round. This is called “horse riding”.</p>
<p>The teacher will take pains to teach the<br />boys and improve their memory power. Whatever fundamental things are required<br />for daily life, the boys will learn in their childhood days. There are several<br />mathematical tables learnt, namely, Keezh-Voy-Ilakkam, Mel-Voy-Ilakkam,<br />Kuzhi-Mattru, Nel-Ilakkam. These all would come handy in their later days.<br />There is one more chuvadi called “Prabhava chuvadi” which is taught to the<br />students. In that, the names of Tamil years, months, stars, yogams, karanams,<br />ragu kalam, kuzhigai kalam, yama kandam etc, the names of emperors, islands,<br />continents etc would be there. The students have to learn them by heart.</p>
<p>In festival days, all the students will go<br />to the temple together. On the 18th day of “Adi” month, allthe old<br />chuvadis which are not required are placed on a decorated chariot and pulled by<br />the students with much fanfare to the river and left in the flowing river. On<br />Pillaiyar Chadhurthi day, it is customary to visit seven Pillaiyar temples.<br />During Sri Jayanthi and Sivarathiri days, the students will sing before each<br />house in the village and generally spend their times happily.</p>

        <p>I kind of analyzed this some time back, I believe we can ensure kids to grow well by positive reinforcement methods than rods and cones.</p>
<p>When you have a pup, you show the stick, its natural to the pup to grow anger against the stick eventually it will counter it.</p>
<p>Same behaviour is in humans, some react some lie, I personally feel the latter more dangerous of behaviour patterns.</p>
<p>Kids forget why the event actually occurred, it does not make sense to beatthem, 10 years from the date, they will still remember the beating but notthe reason. That is NOT what is needed.</p>
<p>The same for any animal or creature of domestic capacity. </p>
<p>When working with youngsters, its better to show them who the 'actual leader of the pack' is, this way it sinks into them in a +ive manner.After all, we are a pack oriented life form :-)</p>
<p>Our actions are directly responsible for their behaviour. Ours meaning all parents including the parents of the kid's peers at school!</p>

<p>  Ganesh, savukku is a means of communicating to the animal when you are not facing it, the driver sits behind not in front, and there is no easy way he can tell the animal. Cows dont hear terribly well by the way and have extremely thick skin.</p>
<p>  I am glad you clarified but i stand by what am saying that using force onchildren is unethical. In 99 percent of the time the parent does not know what to do, in such cases he/she should take help, talk to similar parents or go to a doctor/child specialist. Most cities have counselling for raising kids nowadays.Kids behave totally out of control only becuase of some health issue they are unable to express, basic needs not met and they are emulating parents behavior. Kids do not do what you say they do what you do, ifyou want to shop/buy things at will, throw tantrums at in laws/bosses/anyone, yell at people in family to get things done - then they will adopt similar means. </p>
<p>  You are talking to someone who helped raise 9 kids by the way, since i was 9 years old myself being in extended family i always had one on my hips, my nickname in the neighborhood was 'kuvaa maloo'. </p>

<p>    Also just fyi, in our family we owned cows/cattle for over 6 generations. The last cow was sold when I was 14. None of the cows ever suffered a beating, all of the were disciplined extremely well with firm training and consistent commands. When they were put in vandi the 'savukku' was only used to press lightly and let the cow knwo when to go fast and when to slow down. </p>
<p>    Animals who suffer beating know how to show their feelings. Cows will hold their milk, try to injure strangers with their horns, dogs bite and cats steal. </p>
<p>    As far as children go, i am not even talking about it. I find it thoroughly 100% disgusting that in today's world educated people should equate their kids to animal training that is in itself primitive and outdated.</p>

        <p>Ganesh, savukku is a means of communicating to the animal when you are not facing it, the driver sits behind not in front, and there is no easy way hecan tell the animal. Cows dont hear terribly well by the way and have extremely thick skin.</p>
<p>I am glad you clarified but i stand by what am saying that using force on children is unethical. In 99 percent of the time the parent does not know what to do, in such cases he/she should take help, talk to similar parents or go to a doctor/child specialist. Most cities have counselling for raisingkids nowadays.Kids behave totally out of control only becuase of some health issue they are unable to express, basic needs not met and they are emulating parents behavior. Kids do not do what you say they do what you do, if you want to shop/buy things at will, throw tantrums at in laws/bosses/anyone, yell at people in family to get things done - then they will adopt similar means. </p>
<p>You are talking to someone who helped raise 9 kids by the way, since i was 9 years old myself being in extended family i always had one on my hips, mynickname in the neighborhood was 'kuvaa maloo'. </p>

<p>  Also just fyi, in our family we owned cows/cattle for over 6 generations.The last cow was sold when I was 14. None of the cows ever suffered a beating, all of the were disciplined extremely well with firm training and consistent commands. When they were put in vandi the 'savukku' was only used topress lightly and let the cow knwo when to go fast and when to slow down. </p>
<p>  Animals who suffer beating know how to show their feelings. Cows will hold their milk, try to injure strangers with their horns, dogs bite and cats steal. </p>
<p>  As far as children go, i am not even talking about it. I find it thoroughly 100% disgusting that in today's world educated people should equate their kids to animal training that is in itself primitive and outdated.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi</p>
<p>Why use savukku ??? If love can drive them why savukku ?? Isn't that occasional control ?? And if you had asked your maattukkaran he would have given 1000 stories of how he controls the madus. As owners you might not have been exposed to the controls, a common thing that happens when the stable incharge behaves in a certain patterns when owners (mudhalali) are around.</p>
<p>I guess the argument is digressing because of taking an analogy given to an assumption of equating with animals</p>

<p>Also just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym , in our family we owned cows/cattle for over 6 generations. The last cow was sold when I was 14. None of the cows ever suffered a beating, all of the were disciplined extremely well with firm training and consistent commands. When they were put in vandi the 'savukku' was only used to press lightly and let the cow knwo when to go fast and when to slow down. </p>
<p>Animals who suffer beating know how to show their feelings. Cows will hold their milk, try to injure strangers with their horns, dogs bite and cats steal. </p>
<p>As far as children go, i am not even talking about it. I find it thoroughly 100% disgusting that in today's world educated people should equate their kids to animal training that is in itself primitive and outdated.</p>

        <p>Also just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym , in our family we owned cows/cattle for over 6 generations. The last cow was sold when I was 14. None of the cows ever suffered a beating, all of the were disciplined extremely well with firm training and consistent commands. When they were put in vandi the 'savukku' was only used to press lightly and let the cow knwo when to go fast and when to slow down. </p>
<p>Animals who suffer beating know how to show their feelings. Cows will hold their milk, try to injure strangers with their horns, dogs bite and cats steal. </p>
<p>As far as children go, i am not even talking about it. I find it thoroughly100% disgusting that in today's world educated people should equate their kids to animal training that is in itself primitive and outdated.</p>

        <p>Ganesh, it is the parents responsibilty to find their sense of balance between 'raja/kannu' and caning the kid. It is disgusting to hear from educatedpeople equating children to animals..adiyaadha maadu padiyaadhu really, even for animals hitting them has found to cause the poor animal to withoold milk and find ways of expressing its feelings. A hit animal is likely to bevery aggressive towards other people.</p>
<p>If you can't find time and patience to groom children - don't have them that is all. Please don't preach cow morals to kids. I am sorry to sound strong this is another 'sati' like issue, completely 100% unethical that is all.</p>

        <p>I think there are two things..one often times caning and such treatments over motivate people - they know they have to do something to stay out of it so they just cram their heads into studies or something..second success does not mean anyone is a good human being. The side effect of caning is that the individual learns to hide the soft/gentle side of his nature and be like that with everyone and it was very veyr common among men of those days tobe very stiff and unemotionless. (My own granfather once threw a hot dosa tava at my grandmother since she forgot to put salt in dosa, it hit her lower lip and the side of the 2 year old she was carrying before landing in the garden. My grandfather went from being a clerk to GM of southern railwaysa huge and not trivial success career wise).<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "abhivencat" <abhivencat@...  wrote:</p>

<p>    Dear friends<br />    This one is quite interesting that I like to share with you all.<br />    somasundaram</p>
<p>    My Young Days in School</p>
<p>    (This extract is from a Tamil book written<br />    by Tamil Thatha, Dr. U. V. Saminathayyar named, “Yen Charithiram”)</p>
<p>    In those days, the village school was<br />    called “ Thinnai Pallikoodam “. The<br />    system of learning was entirely different. All the boys have to arrive at the<br />    school at 5 A.M. itself with their palm leaf (Panai Olai) “chuvadis”. All the<br />    chuvadis are connected to a wooden piece of same size attached by meansof a<br />    string and tied. This is called “chuvadi thooku”. As soon as the boys arrive at<br />    the school, they have to hang their chuvadi thooku in the walls and they have<br />    to recite the lessons taught on the previous day loudly, taking turns. The<br />    teacher would be inside the house (the school ) and would be listening to their<br />    recitations.</p>
<p>    After 6 A.M., all the boys go out to finish<br />    their morning duties, bathe in the river or canal, wear their religioussymbols<br />    on their forehead and chant the necessary mantras/ slokas sitting on the river<br />    bank. Then they will carry in their clothes sufficient quantity of clean sand<br />    and come to the school. They will remove the sand already spread on thefloor<br />    on the previous day and spread the new sand in its place for writing purposes. Some<br />    will write and some will read.</p>
<p>    At 9 A.M., they will eat the rice which<br />    they have brought along. This rice is called “Pazhayadhu”. Before eating, the<br />    teacher will give each boy a blow with his cane in his palm. This is probably<br />    to remind them that they are in the school and not in their house.</p>
<p>    The teacher will appoint one boy as<br />    “monitor”. He is normally a well built boy who has to control the other boys.<br />    It is his duty not only to control but also listen to the recitations and note<br />    the mistakes. Some boys try to earn his good-will by giving something to eat<br />    from their homes.</p>
<p>    After noon, the boys will go to their homes<br />    for lunch and come back at 3 P.M.. The classes may extend up to 7 P.M. even.</p>
<p>    Every day evening, the teacher will tell<br />    each boy the name of either a flower or a bird, or an animal or a village and<br />    he has to remember the name and tell the teacher correctly the next day. This<br />    exercise is to improve the memory power of the boy.</p>
<p>    Since the boys have to come to the school as<br />    early as 5 A.M., they will be accompanied by some elders .If they come late,<br />    they will get a cane beating on their palm. The first late arrival willescape<br />    with a soft touch. However the subsequent arrivals will experience the ferocity<br />    and frequency of beatings in increasing order. The boy who got a good beating<br />    will probably be the first boy to arrive next day, even before time. The first<br />    boy is called as a “Different One”(Vettran). Sometimes the joy of the first<br />    person may be short lived because already there may be some one before him<br />    lurking in the dark corner who indicates his presence by a cough.<br />    For those boys, sand is the present day<br />is<br />    written in the chuvadi by the teacher, the student will learn the alphabets<br />    first, called as “Nedunkanakku”. Then he will learn numbers. The chuvadi in<br />    which the teacher has written is called the Original Olai or “Chattam”.</p>
<p>    The numbers and letters written in the<br />    chuvadi are more visible if we apply either turmeric powder, or charcoal, or<br />    Oomathai leaf juice. They also preserve the chuvadi.<br />    Chuvadis are of different sizes. There will<br />    be a hole in each chuvadi and a thread will be inserted into the hole to tie<br />    them together. Blank chuvadis will be attached both in the front and back.</p>
<p>    Yezhuthanis are of different types .e.g.<br />    stout ones (gundu yezhuthani), pull types (vaaru yezhuthani), foldable ones<br />    (madakku yezhuthani) etc.<br />    For the pull types, there will be a<br />    scabbard made up of palm leaf (panai olai). For the foldable ones, there will<br />    be a handle made up of ivory, or horn, or wood.</p>
<p>    When a boy begins to start reading a new<br />    book (Nool),the process is called “Chuvadi Thuvakkal”. Before the teacher<br />    starts a lesson from the “Nool”, that chuvadi will be placed before Lord<br />    Pillaiyar after applying turmeric and pooja done, to invoke His Blessings.</p>
<p>    On that day, the boy will bring a kind of<br />    rice called “kaapparisi”, probably pounded rice (aval) mixed with coconut<br />    pieces, jaggery and sesame from his home and it will be distributed to all the<br />    boys. That day will be declared a holiday for the school. All the boys will be<br />    happy not because they are going to start reading a new book but because they<br />    are getting a holiday and the accompanying snacks.</p>
<p>    Further, there will be no school on New<br />    Moon day, Full Moon day, Ashtami day, and Pirathamai day. These days are called<br />    “Vaavu”, probably derived from the word “Uvaa” which means New Moon and Full<br />    Moon.</p>
<p>    Every student will bring daily, one gift<br />    article and give it to the teacher. It can be either a fruit, or pancake or<br />    firewood etc. On function days, they will bring whatever essential things<br />    required for the same function in the teacher’s house. On holidays, they may<br />    give money also.</p>
<p>    Every month, the tuition fees for the<br />    teacher is quarter of a rupee per head .Rich people may give annual requirement<br />    of paddy. On special days, they may give other donations also. During<br />    Navarathiri days, the students will get dressed up, sing songs, play “Kolattam”<br />    etc. The teacher will take them to everybody’s house in the village and make<br />    them sing. Every household may give some donation and all such income will go<br />    to the teacher. This income is called “maanamboo”. The word, “Maha Nonbu” has changed into this word. With this<br />    income of “maanamboo” only, the teachers are able to conduct weddings in their<br />    houses.</p>
<p>    The teacher is also called “Kanakkayar”.<br />    The village people always behave with respect. Whatever the teacher does to the<br />    boys, will never be questioned by them. Neither do they feel sorry. On the<br />    other hand, mischievous boys are specifically entrusted to the teacher to be<br />    set right.</p>
<p>    All the childhood days are spent under the<br />    control of teacher. Students will treat the teachers as if they were gods. They<br />    during essential times will also do the household chores of the teacher.</p>
<p>    In school, the students will tremble at the<br />    prospect of receiving punishment from the teacher. Beating with cane isthe<br />    most common punishment. Sometimes, the boys are asked to hold a rope tied to a<br />    rafter and hang for specified time. This punishment is called “Kothandam”.<br />    Other times, the teacher may ask one boy to climb on the back of the errant boy<br />    and he has to go round. This is called “horse riding”.</p>
<p>    The teacher will take pains to teach the<br />    boys and improve their memory power. Whatever fundamental things are required<br />    for daily life, the boys will learn in their childhood days. There are several<br />    mathematical tables learnt, namely, Keezh-Voy-Ilakkam, Mel-Voy-Ilakkam,<br />    Kuzhi-Mattru, Nel-Ilakkam. These all would come handy in their later days.<br />    There is one more chuvadi called “Prabhava chuvadi” which is taught to the<br />    students. In that, the names of Tamil years, months, stars, yogams, karanams,<br />    ragu kalam, kuzhigai kalam, yama kandam etc, the names of emperors, islands,<br />    continents etc would be there. The students have to learn them by heart.</p>
<p>    In festival days, all the students will go<br />    to the temple together. On the 18th day of “Adi” month,all the old<br />    chuvadis which are not required are placed on a decorated chariot and pulled by<br />    the students with much fanfare to the river and left in the flowing river. On<br />    Pillaiyar Chadhurthi day, it is customary to visit seven Pillaiyar temples.<br />    During Sri Jayanthi and Sivarathiri days, the students will sing beforeeach<br />    house in the village and generally spend their times happily.</p>

        <p>-there was this article two days back about a school in thiruneleli which boasts of alumini like barathi,voc and tvs. u ve sa seems to have taught inthe school too.</p>
<p>venketesh</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear friends<br />  This one is quite interesting that I like to share with you all.<br />  somasundaram</p>
<p>  My Young Days in School</p>
<p>  (This extract is from a Tamil book written<br />  by Tamil Thatha, Dr. U. V. Saminathayyar named, “Yen Charithiram”)</p>
<p>  In those days, the village school was<br />  called “ Thinnai Pallikoodam “. The<br />  system of learning was entirely different. All the boys have to arrive atthe<br />  school at 5 A.M. itself with their palm leaf (Panai Olai) “chuvadis”. All the<br />  chuvadis are connected to a wooden piece of same size attached by means of a<br />  string and tied. This is called “chuvadi thooku”. As soonas the boys arrive at<br />  the school, they have to hang their chuvadi thooku in the walls and they have<br />  to recite the lessons taught on the previous day loudly, taking turns. The<br />  teacher would be inside the house (the school ) and would be listening totheir<br />  recitations.</p>
<p>  After 6 A.M., all the boys go out to finish<br />  their morning duties, bathe in the river or canal, wear their religious symbols<br />  on their forehead and chant the necessary mantras/ slokas sitting on the river<br />  bank. Then they will carry in their clothes sufficient quantity of clean sand<br />  and come to the school. They will remove the sand already spread on the floor<br />  on the previous day and spread the new sand in its place for writing purposes. Some<br />  will write and some will read.</p>
<p>  At 9 A.M., they will eat the rice which<br />  they have brought along. This rice is called “Pazhayadhu”. Before eating, the<br />  teacher will give each boy a blow with his cane in his palm. This is probably<br />  to remind them that they are in the school and not in their house.</p>
<p>  The teacher will appoint one boy as<br />  “monitor”. He is normally a well built boy who has to control the other boys.<br />  It is his duty not only to control but also listen to the recitations andnote<br />  the mistakes. Some boys try to earn his good-will by giving something to eat<br />  from their homes.</p>
<p>  After noon, the boys will go to their homes<br />  for lunch and come back at 3 P.M.. The classes may extend up to 7 P.M. even.</p>
<p>  Every day evening, the teacher will tell<br />  each boy the name of either a flower or a bird, or an animal or a villageand<br />  he has to remember the name and tell the teacher correctly the next day. This<br />  exercise is to improve the memory power of the boy.</p>
