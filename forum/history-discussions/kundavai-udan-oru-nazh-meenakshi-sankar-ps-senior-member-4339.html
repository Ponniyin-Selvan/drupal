<p>Just reposted message no: 478 and 530 by one of our members <br />Meenakshi Sankar !</p>
<p>The same Meenakshi Sankar who wrote such a wonderful article in the <br />MARATHADI group and discussed earlier in our Group in 2004.</p>
<p>Thank you Dear Arun for making everyone read this .. again.</p>
<p>In case Meenkashi Sankar is also happened to be on of those silent <br />members, request post more mails in our Group again.</p>
<p>anbudan / sps<br />================<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Meenakshisankar <br /><kavizine@...  wrote Message 478 :</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm a member from Bangalore. Though I would love to<br />join the yaathirai, I'm sorry I couldn't because of my<br />examinations. I wish you a great and fruitful trip.<br />And eager to know the status of the places about which<br />I have dreamed for a long time now..</p>
<p>About the most disturbing death, I would rule out<br />Karikalan because we knew from beginning that he would<br />die, due to historical facts. And Kalki established<br />clearly that Nandhini will cause it, So nothing<br />majorly disturbing about that.</p>
<p>I don't consider Pinagapani's death disturbing in any<br />way. I mean, it did not affect me as a reader, neither<br />did it affect the story line or flow in any major way.</p>
<p>Mandhagini's death was a result of her love for the<br />King. And from the time she saw the assassin in the<br />ragasiya nilavaRai, it is easy to deduce that she will<br />give her life to save the king. It was an emotional<br />death, but certainly not a disturbing one, considering<br />that the king too recognised her love by holding her<br />on his lap in her dying moments. This death proves<br />that pure love is always rewarded, and pure love is<br />worth giving one's life for. These are certainly not<br />disturbing thoughts, are they??</p>
<p>The two other deaths of Pazhuvettaraiyar and<br />Manimegalai are the most tragic. And most disturbing<br />for me because they are closely linked to my favourite<br />character Vandhiyathevan. What Manimegalai had for VT<br />is the purest of all love, at times even better than<br />what Kundavai showed for VT. Because VT has already<br />lost his heart to Kundavai, he couldn't reciprocate to<br />Manimekalai. Pazhuvettaraiyar, on the other hand,<br />though he killed himself for failing in his duty and<br />committing serious mistakes, he gave his life also to<br />clear VT from the charge of killing Karikalan. If he<br />hadn't owned up responsibility for Karikalan's death,<br />then VT would not have been able to lead a peaceful<br />life. So that justifies Pazhuvettaraiyar's death to<br />some extent.</p>
<p>But Manimekalai's death was most unfortunate and most<br />tragic and unexpected for me. Further she did not get<br />her love reciprocated (for no fault of nobody though.)<br />And the fact that Kalki chose this death to end the<br />story also makes it poignant. I was expecting the<br />climax to be a scene in the aranmanai nandavanam<br />describing a romantic conversation between<br />Vandhiyathevan and Kundavai. Kalki was there in the<br />middle of the romance but suddenly introduced<br />Kandhamaaran's letter about Manimekalai, making me<br />very miserable.</p>
<p>By these acounts, I would say Manimekalai's death was<br />the most disturbing one.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This comparison between Kundhavai and Nandhini is done<br />by Aazhvaarkadiyaan. He says this to Vanthiyathevan<br />just before they both are about to meet Arulmozhi in<br />Tampallai buddhist punniya kshetram.</p>

<p>        Hi,</p>
<p>        I'm a member from Bangalore. Though I would love to<br />        join the yaathirai, I'm sorry I couldn't because of my<br />        examinations. I wish you a great and fruitful trip.<br />        And eager to know the status of the places about which<br />        I have dreamed for a long time now..</p>
<p>        About the most disturbing death, I would rule out<br />        Karikalan because we knew from beginning that he would<br />        die, due to historical facts. And Kalki established<br />        clearly that Nandhini will cause it, So nothing<br />        majorly disturbing about that.</p>
<p>        I don't consider Pinagapani's death disturbing in any<br />        way. I mean, it did not affect me as a reader, neither<br />        did it affect the story line or flow in any major way.</p>
<p>        Mandhagini's death was a result of her love for the<br />        King. And from the time she saw the assassin in the<br />        ragasiya nilavaRai, it is easy to deduce that she will<br />        give her life to save the king. It was an emotional<br />        death, but certainly not a disturbing one, considering<br />        that the king too recognised her love by holding her<br />        on his lap in her dying moments. This death proves<br />        that pure love is always rewarded, and pure love is<br />        worth giving one's life for. These are certainly not<br />        disturbing thoughts, are they??</p>
<p>        The two other deaths of Pazhuvettaraiyar and<br />        Manimegalai are the most tragic. And most disturbing<br />        for me because they are closely linked to my favourite<br />        character Vandhiyathevan. What Manimegalai had for VT<br />        is the purest of all love, at times even better than<br />        what Kundavai showed for VT. Because VT has already<br />        lost his heart to Kundavai, he couldn't reciprocate to<br />        Manimekalai. Pazhuvettaraiyar, on the other hand,<br />        though he killed himself for failing in his duty and<br />        committing serious mistakes, he gave his life also to<br />        clear VT from the charge of killing Karikalan. If he<br />        hadn't owned up responsibility for Karikalan's death,<br />        then VT would not have been able to lead a peaceful<br />        life. So that justifies Pazhuvettaraiyar's death to<br />        some extent.</p>
<p>        But Manimekalai's death was most unfortunate and most<br />        tragic and unexpected for me. Further she did not get<br />        her love reciprocated (for no fault of nobody though.)<br />        And the fact that Kalki chose this death to end the<br />        story also makes it poignant. I was expecting the<br />        climax to be a scene in the aranmanai nandavanam<br />        describing a romantic conversation between<br />        Vandhiyathevan and Kundavai. Kalki was there in the<br />        middle of the romance but suddenly introduced<br />        Kandhamaaran's letter about Manimekalai, making me<br />        very miserable.</p>
<p>        By these acounts, I would say Manimekalai's death was<br />        the most disturbing one.</p>

And from the time she saw the assassin in the<br />    ragasiya nilavaRai, it is easy to deduce that she will<br />    give her life to save the king. It was an emotional<br />    death, but certainly not a disturbing one, considering<br />    that the king too recognised her love by holding her<br />    on his lap in her dying moments. This death proves<br />    that pure love is always rewarded, and pure love is<br />    worth giving one's life for. These are certainly not<br />    disturbing thoughts, are they??</p>
<p>    The two other deaths of Pazhuvettaraiyar and<br />    Manimegalai are the most tragic. And most disturbing<br />    for me because they are closely linked to my favourite<br />    character Vandhiyathevan. What Manimegalai had for VT<br />    is the purest of all love, at times even better than<br />    what Kundavai showed for VT. Because VT has already<br />    lost his heart to Kundavai, he couldn't reciprocate to<br />    Manimekalai. Pazhuvettaraiyar, on the other hand,<br />    though he killed himself for failing in his duty and<br />    committing serious mistakes, he gave his life also to<br />    clear VT from the charge of killing Karikalan. If he<br />    hadn't owned up responsibility for Karikalan's death,<br />    then VT would not have been able to lead a peaceful<br />    life. So that justifies Pazhuvettaraiyar's death to<br />    some extent.</p>
<p>    But Manimekalai's death was most unfortunate and most<br />    tragic and unexpected for me. Further she did not get<br />    her love reciprocated (for no fault of nobody though.)<br />    And the fact that Kalki chose this death to end the<br />    story also makes it poignant. I was expecting the<br />    climax to be a scene in the aranmanai nandavanam<br />    describing a romantic conversation between<br />    Vandhiyathevan and Kundavai. Kalki was there in the<br />    middle of the romance but suddenly introduced<br />    Kandhamaaran's letter about Manimekalai, making me<br />    very miserable.</p>
<p>    By these acounts, I would say Manimekalai's death was<br />    the most disturbing one.</p>

<p>  Hi,</p>
<p>  I'm a member from Bangalore. Though I would love to<br />  join the yaathirai, I'm sorry I couldn't because of my<br />  examinations. I wish you a great and fruitful trip.<br />  And eager to know the status of the places about which<br />  I have dreamed for a long time now..</p>
<p>  About the most disturbing death, I would rule out<br />  Karikalan because we knew from beginning that he would<br />  die, due to historical facts. And Kalki established<br />  clearly that Nandhini will cause it, So nothing<br />  majorly disturbing about that.</p>
