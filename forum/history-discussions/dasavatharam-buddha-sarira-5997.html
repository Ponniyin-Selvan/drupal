<blockquote><p>  Am glad we are not arguing theologies.<br />  ?<br />  Yes I agree 100% on the usage of the word Buddha as well as <br />Avathar. Yes there is no evidence that Gautama Buddha was a vishnu </p></blockquote>
<p>avatar too. But is there any 'evidence' that any human being <br />historically was a 'vishnu avatar'? <br />-----------------------------------------<br />The Birth of the Holy One ::</p>
<p>Amongst the unconquerable Sakyas, here was a King named SUDDHODANA, <br />a descendant of IKSHVAAKU. In power the equal of Ikshvaku, of pure <br />conduct, his people like the autumn moon. The wife of him, <br />resembled beauty of Padma was called MAAYA thus a goddess Laksmi, <br />par excellence .. </p>
<p>These are the opening TWO LINES of BUDDHACARITA, the Life of the <br />Buddha, translated from Sanskrit to English by IRMA SCHOTSMAN, <br />published by the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, <br />Sarnath, Varnasi in 1995.</p>
<p>Introduction says : The Buddahcarita was composed by Asvaghosa, who <br />probably lived in the first half Century AD. He also authored <br />Saundarananda and Sariputraprakarana. He was a brahmin converted to <br />Hinayana Buddhism.</p>
<p>Well.. the field is opened up further...</p>
<p>sps  </p>
<p>What we wish to believe sentimentally is besides the point,. Puranas <br />are not history, they are a mix of historical events with <br />mythological allegories, we will never be able to prove anyone is <br />an 'avatar', or even a 'saint', we accord those terms to people we <br />think are a certain way and that will always be a matter of dispute.</p>

<p>  There are thousands of avatars,technically even RRC/RJC etc were <br />  such. Consider the manifestation as a concept of equilibirium. <br />  Only in these 10, midst of a select few, the sense and purpose was <br />  documented. </p>
<p>  Also, I tend believe, Gauthama Budha was only one but the Budha <br />name <br />  ('The awakened') is associated with quite a few.<br />  G. Budha's birth was close to 400BC, Krsna's cannot be easily <br />  documented.<br />  Budha title is like Baba...</p>
<p>  There seems to be no concrete evidence that Gauthama was a vishnu <br />  incarnate. If there is, it would be good if any forum member can <br />  share the info.</p>

<p>    Hi Vijay</p>
<p>    now we have 2 entirely different propositions</p>
<p>    A) there could be more than 10 avatars</p>
<p>    B) there could be more than 1 buddha</p>
<p>    my question is when was the word dasavatharam mentioned first? <br />any <br />    idea.</p>
<p>    we need to agree that buddha was not a 9th century phenomenon to <br />  be <br />    juxtaposed in the other avathars. he was as much in the past as <br />    krishna to those in mallai or thanjchai .</p>
<p>    if we find an answer to the above i think we owe one to kamal <br />for <br />    stirring it up.<br />    venketesh</p>

<p>          The above is as recorded in Srimadh Bhagavatham. So this <br />  Buddha <br />    of <br />          Vishnu is definitely different from the Gauthama Buddha. <br />The <br />    later <br />          day (but as early as Pallava sculptures) artists could <br />have <br />          misconstrued this to be Gauthama Buddha and hence we see <br />him <br />  in <br />    the <br />          10 Avatars list.</p>
<p>        Great hypothesis. </p>
<p>        now vijay whats your opinion on this?</p>
<p>        venketesh</p>
<p>      hi<br />      I hv the greatest of respect for all faiths ...but look at it <br />    purely based on info b4 u...</p>
<p>      By your own words buddha is an incarnation of vishnu....that <br />this <br />    buddha is not that buddha is not the question. The same mallai <br />  sirpi <br />    sculpted the magnificient govardhana panel...depicting krishna <br />in <br />  all <br />    his glory true to the minutest detail as sung by alwars....but <br />did <br />    not mention kishna avatar in the inscription. ...how do you <br />justify <br />    that.</p>
<p>      Similarly, pl refer the iconography of the brihadesvara <br />  temple ... <br />    Dr francoise l'hernault.. . <br />      Page 29.. And plates 9 ( southern stairway of vestibule) and <br />  plate <br />    16 ( inner gateway west facade)due copyright I can't put the <br />images <br />    here, but anyone fm tanjore cn check... The buddha is depicted <br />in <br />    these two panels under a tree _ seated..I would like you study <br />  these <br />    panels and come to a conclusion. The extent to which raja raja <br />    immersed into shiva n the legends associated with him is not for <br />us <br />    to fathom... We will never know what info was available to them <br />  those <br />    days ..but one thing is for sure, if we are talking of evidence <br />fm <br />    literature ... I would always go by rrc n mahendra's <br />version...they <br />    alone were colossol spiritual greats but combine them with the <br />kind <br />    of people / saints / gurus they grew with, what we hv now is <br />    miniscule in whatever terms ... Info, understanding , content , <br />    avaliability of text n lastly truly enlightened souls..</p>

        <p>A real treasure trove as very rightly put.</p>
<p>Highly informative and lots of assumptions need to be revisited.</p>
<p>I fully agree that the Chozha painters followed Sundarar's hymns and <br />periyapuranam was written later and most probably Sekkizhar <br />personally visited this temple.</p>
<p>Thanks Vijay. Very best regards to Dr. Kalaikkovan &amp; Dr. Nalini.</p>

        <p>I believe there is some confusion here and I did not find any direct<br />reference to wearing the sacred thread by Buddhists.

Perhaps I should do more study.</p>

        <p>Yes Deepa very well said. The buddha to my mind was more radical in his study of human mind and enlightenment than he was of ahimsa. As far as world myths go Joseph Campbell has studied and commented widely on similarities and differences. Campbell was among radical westerners who commented michaelangelo s work on abrahamic myth to be &#39;far less interesting&#39; compared to the trimoorthi facehead at Elephanta caves. Will write more later.</p>

It is one of the tenets <br />  of living prescribed in the Upanishads (I think Chandogya). The 3 key <br />  tenets of living are stated to be brahmacharyam (referring to self- <br />  control, not living as a bachelor :)), ahimsa and satyam. <br />  Secondly, isn't it true that Jainism focuses on Ahimsa even more than <br />  Buddhism does or modern day Hinduism does? <br />  Of course, Buddha should be commended for popularizing/ reiterating the <br />  idea! </p>

The 3 key<br />  tenets of living are stated to be brahmacharyam (referring to self-<br />  control, not living as a bachelor :)), ahimsa and satyam.</p>

        <p>Wow!!! That was a great comparision. I had never looked into these <br />Abrahamic beliefs in this way, except that the Noah's flood could <br />have been a simile to our Matsya Avatar.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Malathy<br />  I have only heard about Atharva Veda/Koran similarities. My dad <br />says <br />  research books are available in India. </p>
<p>  The similarities between antiquarian religions/cultures is <br />  fascinating. One wonders if <br />  a) one was copied or influenced by others, or<br />  b) if the thoughts happened independently.</p>
<p>  Of course, now, we know trade happened with Greece, Middle east, <br />and <br />  even Mayans attacked India. But it would be interesting to know <br />how <br />  cultural/religious practices dispersed and got assimilated. </p>
<p>  Some similarities, which I find fascinating, between <br />Indian/Abrahamic <br />  and other religions<br />  1) Abraham and Sarah of the Old Testament (original spelling <br />Abrahm <br />  and Sarai) and our Brahma and Saraswathi<br />  2) The Noah's Ark episode and our Matsya Avatar episode of floods<br />  3) Noah (original spelling Nuh) and Manu (name similarity)<br />  4) Early Romans had a religious symbol called Fascinus very <br />similar <br />  to our Siva Lingam (from great book "Roma" by Steven Saylor)<br />  5) Greek God Zeus and our Shiva (name similarity. many common <br />  stories.. like Zeus lived on Mt.Olympus and Siva of course on <br />Kailash)<br />  6) Greek God Dionysus and our Muruga (excerpt from research study <br />on <br />  the Katirgama cult below)</p>
<p>  **********************************<br />  Like Skanda-Murukan, Dionysus "is neither child nor man but, <br />eternal <br />  adolescent, occupies a place somewhere between the two."21 As <br />such, <br />  both represent "the spirit of ludic energy and the power of <br />  transformative play,"22 full of cunning, deception and strategies <br />  that are at once diabolical and divine. In this they reveal their <br />  common affinity to Hermes, the Greek god of cunning, theft and <br />  eloquence whose caduceus or herald's magical wand finds its <br />  counterpart in Skanda-Murukan's vel (Tamil: 'spear'), called his <br />  J?&#257;na Shakti or 'power of gnosis'.</p>
<p>  In Greek mythology, Dionysus is born from his father's thigh and <br />  delivered to twelve nymphs or water-spirits, the Hyades, who <br />become <br />  the child-god's wet-nurses. Later, out of gratitude for their <br />  service, they are exalted to the heavens where seven of them shine <br />as <br />  the constellation Pleiades. Likewise Skanda, born directly from <br />  Shiva, descends to earth where he is found in a reedy marsh by six <br />  water spirits, the Krittika maidens, who serve as the god's wet-<br />  nurses and later are exalted to heaven as the Krittika <br />constellation, <br />  which is none other than the Pleiades; hence Skanda is also <br />  Karttikeya, 'born of the Pleiades'. Just as Dionysus is <br />  Purigenes, 'the one born of fire', so likewise is Skanda called <br />  Agnibhu. Skanda is Sharadhajanma, 'born in a reedy marsh'; <br />Dionysus <br />  is Limnaios, 'of the marsh'. Dionysus is Dithyrambos, 'twice-<br />born', <br />  i.e. born first from fire and then from water. Likewise, Skanda is <br />  born first from the fiery element of his father's third eye and <br />then <br />  born a second time in the watery element of Saravana, a reedy <br />marsh. <br />  Danielou draws attention to this astonishing convergence of <br />thematic <br />  elements and concludes that "Murugan, born in a reedy marsh and <br />  nourished by nymphs, is elsewhere called Dionysus."23 So <br />remarkably <br />  parallel are the thematic elements surrounding the complex birth-<br />  motif that it strains credibility to ascribe these similarities to <br />  sheer coincidence. </p>

<p>    Venkatesh<br />    As I said, these are all theories in circulation. I do know <br />    the "global opinion", but that does not mean we can completely <br />    discard new opinions. Sure, some of them are imaginary or <br />wishful-<br />    thinking, but others have to be given the benefit of doubt.</p>
<p>    If we all believe in one supreme power and if we believe <br />    in "sambhavami yuge yuge", why does God/Vishnu have to take <br />avatars <br />    only in India? Any great saint/reformer across the world is <br />    technically a avatar. The Srimad Bhagavatham may not have <br />captured <br />    all the avatars, but that doesnt mean they are not avatars. The <br />  idea <br />    of a Prophet Mohammed or Jesus or Lao Tze or Zoroaster as <br />avatars <br />  is <br />    fascinating and divine. (My opinions apart, many people have <br />    commented on the similarities between the Koran and Atharva Veda)</p>
<p>    I agree that the evidence is slim for the two-Sankara theory, <br />  though <br />    there is still controvery around some of the works. (Viveka <br />  Chudamani <br />    for one). So, who knows? </p>
<p>    One thing regarding your statement below - I dont see the <br />  connection <br />    between my comment on Gita and Saivities. <br />    Followers of Sankara are NOT Saivites - they are called Smarthas <br />  and <br />    they can believe in any of the Shanmadhams set up by Sankara <br />  himself. <br />    In fact, Smarthas believe that the Nirguma Brahmam is <br />personified <br />  in <br />    Siva/Vishnu/ Brahma and are open to worshipping any God-form. </p>
<p>    ************ ********* ********* ********* ********* ********* **<br />     What is the basis on which this claim is made. Is there any <br />      reference to, even an existence of such belief? And if this is <br />      accepted for argument sake, then the followers of Sankara, <br />could <br />    not <br />      be Saivites and they have to be only Vaishnavites and we all <br />      probably know what is written in Gita. Well, I am not <br />intending <br />  on <br />    a <br />      pan-religion or pan-sect debate here, but am only trying to <br />list <br />    the <br />      reasons, why Sankara could not be BCE.<br />      ************ ********* ********* ********* ********* *******</p>

<p>      Indeed these are tangents to the debate. Only that it does not <br />      actually touch the periphery of the circle.</p>
<p>      The mention of Prophet Muhammed in Bhavishya Purana was a <br />later <br />  day <br />      addition. Or simply idaicherugal. So this carries no water. <br />But <br />  who <br />      did it? Was it the Hindus of India or the Muslims of India? I <br />  dont <br />      know honestly. But this definitely carries no water. In fact, <br />  take <br />    a <br />      breath, the same Islamic websites interpret this Prophet <br />Muhammed <br />    as <br />      the Kalki Avatar. Does any one want to subscribe to this <br />belief. </p>
<p>      And again, I still stand by my word (which was originally <br />echoed <br />  by <br />      Smt Malathi) that Puranas are nothing but a little history <br />with <br />    some <br />      many mythical allegories. So this tangent is now fired away.</p>
<p>      Regarding Adhi Sankara, the claim that he might have belong to <br />a <br />      time BCE is really far fetched. And about two Sankaras, even I <br />  have <br />      heard that. But this view does not have a global acceptance. <br />  Indeed <br />      it was Kaladi Sankara who revived the Sanathana Dharma after <br />the <br />      onslaught of Jainisma and Buddhism in South India. It is the <br />same <br />      Kaladi Sankara who stuck to Nirguna Brahmam and also had a <br />Saguna <br />      Brahmam and said "Bhaja Govindam, Bhaja Govindam, Govindam <br />Bhaja <br />      mooDa mathE". So if at all there was another Sankara who wrote <br />      Lalitha Sahasranamam etc, he must have been after this Kaladi <br />      Sankara. But I am sure that the Global view is that, it is the <br />  same <br />      Kaladi Sankara, who wrote these slokas as well. </p>
<p>      ++++++++++++ Quote++++ +++++++++ +++++<br />      In addition, the first Shankara may also have been the author <br />of <br />        Bhagavad Gita, and introduced it into Mahabharatha, in order <br />to <br />      make <br />        the Vedic truths accessible to common man.<br />      +++++++++++Unquote+ +++++++++ +++++++</p>

          Dasavatharam - Buddha Sarira ..        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Smt Deepa,</p>
<p>Great Words!! Sorry that I interpreted your previous posts, so <br />literally. </p>
<p>Yes, if we are ready to look upon in a Broader Perspective, even you <br />and me and the entire world are avatars of Vishnu. If you want to <br />term a Prophet Muhammed or Jesus Christ or a Zoroaster as an avatar <br />of Vishnu, I will be the most happiest person. The reason is, <br />atleast someone subscribing to Nammazhwar's views openly. I have <br />quoted this before and am doing it again. He says in his <br />Thiruviruttam,</p>
<p>"vaNangum thuRaigaL palapalavAkki, madhi vikaRppAl<br />piNangum samayam palapala vAkki, avai avai thoRu<br />aNangum palapalavAkki, nin mUrthi parappi vaithhAi,<br />iNangu ninOrai illAi, ninkaN vEtkai ezhuvippaNE"</p>
<p>Please note the words, "piNangum samayam palapala vAkki" <br />and "avaiavai thOru aNangum palapalavAkki nin mUrthi parappi <br />vaithhAi". These words are nothing but a direct answer to your <br />question regarding Prophet Muhammed or Jesus Christ or for that sake <br />anybody else. </p>
<p>And more importantly, if we can see the world in that way, there <br />will be total harmony. Now you may wonder,why I objected to the view <br />that Prophet Muhammed being an avatar of Vishnu. Let me clarify that <br />I wrote that only with respect to the scriptures. I mean, only those <br />avatars that are explicitly mentioned in the scriptures that we <br />follow.</p>
<p>So I am fine with it, if one says objectively that every one in the <br />world is an avatar of one Supreme Being. Afterall I quoted earlier, <br />again from Nammazhwar ".. en ninRa yOniyumAip pirandhAi imayOr <br />thalaivA.."</p>
<p>Regarding the Gita and Saivites, I had just posted my rejoinder to <br />Satish's post, and clarified my words. However the link that I was <br />intending is, in a coloquial sense, in Gita, Krishna says that He is <br />the God of Gods and one need to surrender to "only Him" to get <br />mOksha. In that case if we accept that it was not Krishna's words <br />but that of Sankara, then followers of Sankara should be rather <br />Vaishnavites and not Saivites, as some of the Smarthas do call <br />themselves as Saivites. This is what I tried to mean. Sorry if I had <br />confused you.</p>

<p>  If we all believe in one supreme power and if we believe <br />  in "sambhavami yuge yuge", why does God/Vishnu have to take <br />avatars <br />  only in India? Any great saint/reformer across the world is <br />  technically a avatar. The Srimad Bhagavatham may not have captured <br />  all the avatars, but that doesnt mean they are not avatars. The <br />idea <br />  of a Prophet Mohammed or Jesus or Lao Tze or Zoroaster as avatars <br />is <br />  fascinating and divine. (My opinions apart, many people have <br />  commented on the similarities between the Koran and Atharva Veda)</p>
<p>  I agree that the evidence is slim for the two-Sankara theory, <br />though <br />  there is still controvery around some of the works. (Viveka <br />Chudamani <br />  for one). So, who knows?  </p>
<p>  One thing regarding your statement below - I dont see the <br />connection <br />  between my comment on Gita and Saivities. <br />  Followers of Sankara are NOT Saivites - they are called Smarthas <br />and <br />  they can believe in any of the Shanmadhams set up by Sankara <br />himself. <br />  In fact, Smarthas believe that the Nirguma Brahmam is personified <br />in <br />  Siva/Vishnu/Brahma and are open to worshipping any God-form. </p>

<p>    Indeed these are tangents to the debate. Only that it does not <br />    actually touch the periphery of the circle.</p>
<p>    The mention of Prophet Muhammed in Bhavishya Purana was a later <br />day <br />    addition. Or simply idaicherugal. So this carries no water. But <br />who <br />    did it? Was it the Hindus of India or the Muslims of India? I <br />dont <br />    know honestly. But this definitely carries no water. In fact, <br />take <br />  a <br />    breath, the same Islamic websites interpret this Prophet <br />Muhammed <br />  as <br />    the Kalki Avatar. Does any one want to subscribe to this belief. </p>
<p>    And again, I still stand by my word (which was originally echoed <br />by <br />    Smt Malathi) that Puranas are nothing but a little history with <br />  some <br />    many mythical allegories. So this tangent is now fired away.</p>
<p>    Regarding Adhi Sankara, the claim that he might have belong to a <br />    time BCE is really far fetched. And about two Sankaras, even I <br />have <br />    heard that. But this view does not have a global acceptance. <br />Indeed <br />    it was Kaladi Sankara who revived the Sanathana Dharma after the <br />    onslaught of Jainisma and Buddhism in South India. It is the <br />same <br />    Kaladi Sankara who stuck to Nirguna Brahmam and also had a <br />Saguna <br />    Brahmam and said "Bhaja Govindam, Bhaja Govindam, Govindam Bhaja <br />    mooDa mathE". So if at all there was another Sankara who wrote <br />    Lalitha Sahasranamam etc, he must have been after this Kaladi <br />    Sankara. But I am sure that the Global view is that, it is the <br />same <br />    Kaladi Sankara, who wrote these slokas as well. </p>
<p>    ++++++++++++Quote++++++++++++++++++<br />    In addition, the first Shankara may also have been the author of <br />      Bhagavad Gita, and introduced it into Mahabharatha, in order <br />to <br />    make <br />      the Vedic truths accessible to common man.<br />    +++++++++++Unquote+++++++++++++++++</p>

        <p>Satish,</p>
<p>Thanks for the note. I did realise on reading it that I did not <br />convey what I intended clearly.</p>
<p>As you said correctly, the followers of Sankara are termed as <br />Smarthas and not Saivites. But most of the later day, I repeat, <br />later day (this "later day" is atleast from the times of Appayya <br />Dikshitar - probably after 1400AD) started terming themselves as <br />Saivites, though they worship Vishnu also. Not like the Veera-<br />Vaishnavites. </p>
<p>This terming is what I intended to convey. Sorry that, the way I <br />wrote had caused a confusion.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing out the error. </p>

<p>  Followers of Adi Sankara, to the much thought of belief, are not<br />  Saivites but are called Smartha's. </p>
<p>  As you yourself mentioned, Sankara did sing Bajagovindam as well as<br />  sang soundarya lahari. So he never preached or practiced Saivism <br />but<br />  veda dharma as a whole.</p>
<p>  Many,( including me till a year ago), think that Sankara's <br />followers<br />  are saivites. Its not so. Smartha's are the ones who go by <br />smrithi's -<br />  veda's and upanishads and they follow the veda dharma. Sanakara<br />  reestablished the veda dharma and his followers are called <br />smartha's<br />  because they follow the smrithis. </p>

        <p>I wanted to make a comment on some earlier discussion on Ahimsa. </p>
<p>Ahimsa is, by no means, Buddha's original idea. It is one of the tenets <br />of living prescribed in the Upanishads (I think Chandogya). The 3 key <br />tenets of living are stated to be brahmacharyam (referring to self-<br />control, not living as a bachelor :)), ahimsa and satyam.</p>
<p>Secondly, isn't it true that Jainism focuses on Ahimsa even more than <br />Buddhism does or modern day Hinduism does? </p>
<p>Of course, Buddha should be commended for popularizing/reiterating the <br />idea!</p>

<p>The similarities between antiquarian religions/cultures is <br />fascinating. One wonders if <br />a) one was copied or influenced by others, or<br />b) if the thoughts happened independently.</p>
<p>Of course, now, we know trade happened with Greece, Middle east, and <br />even Mayans attacked India. But it would be interesting to know how <br />cultural/religious practices dispersed and got assimilated. </p>
<p>Some similarities, which I find fascinating, between Indian/Abrahamic <br />and other religions<br />1) Abraham and Sarah of the Old Testament (original spelling Abrahm <br />and Sarai) and our Brahma and Saraswathi<br />2) The Noah's Ark episode and our Matsya Avatar episode of floods<br />3) Noah (original spelling Nuh) and Manu (name similarity)<br />4) Early Romans had a religious symbol called Fascinus very similar <br />to our Siva Lingam (from great book "Roma" by Steven Saylor)<br />5) Greek God Zeus and our Shiva (name similarity. many common <br />stories.. like Zeus lived on Mt.Olympus and Siva of course on Kailash)<br />6) Greek God Dionysus and our Muruga (excerpt from research study on <br />the Katirgama cult below)</p>
<p>**********************************<br />Like Skanda-Murukan, Dionysus "is neither child nor man but, eternal <br />adolescent, occupies a place somewhere between the two."21 As such, <br />both represent "the spirit of ludic energy and the power of <br />transformative play,"22 full of cunning, deception and strategies <br />that are at once diabolical and divine. In this they reveal their <br />common affinity to Hermes, the Greek god of cunning, theft and <br />eloquence whose caduceus or herald's magical wand finds its <br />counterpart in Skanda-Murukan's vel (Tamil: 'spear'), called his <br />J?&#257;na Shakti or 'power of gnosis'.</p>
<p>In Greek mythology, Dionysus is born from his father's thigh and <br />delivered to twelve nymphs or water-spirits, the Hyades, who become <br />the child-god's wet-nurses. Later, out of gratitude for their <br />service, they are exalted to the heavens where seven of them shine as <br />the constellation Pleiades. Likewise Skanda, born directly from <br />Shiva, descends to earth where he is found in a reedy marsh by six <br />water spirits, the Krittika maidens, who serve as the god's wet-<br />nurses and later are exalted to heaven as the Krittika constellation, <br />which is none other than the Pleiades; hence Skanda is also <br />Karttikeya, 'born of the Pleiades'. Just as Dionysus is <br />Purigenes, 'the one born of fire', so likewise is Skanda called <br />Agnibhu. Skanda is Sharadhajanma, 'born in a reedy marsh'; Dionysus <br />is Limnaios, 'of the marsh'. Dionysus is Dithyrambos, 'twice-born', <br />i.e. born first from fire and then from water. Likewise, Skanda is <br />born first from the fiery element of his father's third eye and then <br />born a second time in the watery element of Saravana, a reedy marsh. <br />Danielou draws attention to this astonishing convergence of thematic <br />elements and concludes that "Murugan, born in a reedy marsh and <br />nourished by nymphs, is elsewhere called Dionysus."23 So remarkably <br />parallel are the thematic elements surrounding the complex birth-<br />motif that it strains credibility to ascribe these similarities to <br />sheer coincidence. </p>

<p>  Venkatesh<br />  As I said, these are all theories in circulation. I do know <br />  the "global opinion", but that does not mean we can completely <br />  discard new opinions. Sure, some of them are imaginary or wishful-<br />  thinking, but others have to be given the benefit of doubt.</p>
<p>  If we all believe in one supreme power and if we believe <br />  in "sambhavami yuge yuge", why does God/Vishnu have to take avatars <br />  only in India? Any great saint/reformer across the world is <br />  technically a avatar. The Srimad Bhagavatham may not have captured <br />  all the avatars, but that doesnt mean they are not avatars. The <br />idea <br />  of a Prophet Mohammed or Jesus or Lao Tze or Zoroaster as avatars <br />is <br />  fascinating and divine. (My opinions apart, many people have <br />  commented on the similarities between the Koran and Atharva Veda)</p>
<p>  I agree that the evidence is slim for the two-Sankara theory, <br />though <br />  there is still controvery around some of the works. (Viveka <br />Chudamani <br />  for one). So, who knows? </p>
<p>  One thing regarding your statement below - I dont see the <br />connection <br />  between my comment on Gita and Saivities. <br />  Followers of Sankara are NOT Saivites - they are called Smarthas <br />and <br />  they can believe in any of the Shanmadhams set up by Sankara <br />himself. <br />  In fact, Smarthas believe that the Nirguma Brahmam is personified <br />in <br />  Siva/Vishnu/ Brahma and are open to worshipping any God-form. </p>

Well, I am not intending <br />on <br />  a <br />    pan-religion or pan-sect debate here, but am only trying to list <br />  the <br />    reasons, why Sankara could not be BCE.<br />    ************ ********* ********* ********* ********* *******</p>

It is the same <br />  Kaladi Sankara who stuck to Nirguna Brahmam and also had a Saguna <br />  Brahmam and said "Bhaja Govindam, Bhaja Govindam, Govindam Bhaja <br />  mooDa mathE". So if at all there was another Sankara who wrote <br />  Lalitha Sahasranamam etc, he must have been after this Kaladi <br />  Sankara. But I am sure that the Global view is that, it is the same <br />  Kaladi Sankara, who wrote these slokas as well. </p>
<p>  ++++++++++++Quote++++++++++++++++++<br />  In addition, the first Shankara may also have been the author of <br />    Bhagavad Gita, and introduced it into Mahabharatha, in order to <br />  make <br />    the Vedic truths accessible to common man.<br />  +++++++++++Unquote+++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>  What is the basis on which this claim is made. Is there any <br />  reference to, even an existence of such belief? And if this is <br />  accepted for argument sake, then the followers of Sankara, could <br />not <br />  be Saivites and they have to be only Vaishnavites and we all <br />  probably know what is written in Gita. Well, I am not intending on <br />a <br />  pan-religion or pan-sect debate here, but am only trying to list <br />the <br />  reasons, why Sankara could not be BCE.</p>

          Dasavatharam - Buddha Sarira ..        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>In this SINGLE - SIGNIFICANT day, our Group appears to be poisted to <br />look at VARIOUS OPTIONS (after taking DEEP breathe )!</p>
<p>1. Member Deepa postulated ::</p>
<p>Profet Mohammed as avtar.</p>
<p>Re Tajmahal (whether it was old Hindu structure) itself, we are <br />yet to have consensus.</p>
<p>Two Sankaras :: The " Aadhi Sankara " period itself is yet to <br />be confirmed - observed our Dear Venkat - recently. Another one - <br />prior to Him ... Sankara .. !</p>
<p>2. Buddha - all said and done the Sage - who undisputedly preached <br />NON-VIOLENCE AND ADORED BY AN EMPEROR OF ASHOKA'S CALIBRE - His Head <br />replaced Vishnu's Head !!</p>
<p>3. Dr. Jaybee recently queried as to why the Heads of Pillayars cut <br />neatly around singampunari area ( in ancient days ) ?</p>
<p>And all because of one Dasavatharam..</p>
<p>and you suggest there should be a Sequal.</p>
<p>Vijay.. this appears to be high voltage week.</p>

<p>  Hi,</p>
<p>  I stand corrected ....just did some searching and find that the <br />  buddha/vishnu statue in the entrance to angkor - was actually <br />taken <br />  from inside the temple ( sounds familiar) and kept at the outer <br />gate <br />  when the hindu temple was taken over by buddhists and converted <br />into <br />  a buddhist shrine.

        <p>Indeed these are tangents to the debate. Only that it does not <br />actually touch the periphery of the circle.</p>
<p>The mention of Prophet Muhammed in Bhavishya Purana was a later day <br />addition. Or simply idaicherugal. So this carries no water. But who <br />did it? Was it the Hindus of India or the Muslims of India? I dont <br />know honestly. But this definitely carries no water. In fact, take a <br />breath, the same Islamic websites interpret this Prophet Muhammed as <br />the Kalki Avatar. Does any one want to subscribe to this belief. </p>
<p>And again, I still stand by my word (which was originally echoed by <br />Smt Malathi) that Puranas are nothing but a little history with some <br />many mythical allegories. So this tangent is now fired away.</p>
<p>Regarding Adhi Sankara, the claim that he might have belong to a <br />time BCE is really far fetched. And about two Sankaras, even I have <br />heard that. But this view does not have a global acceptance. Indeed <br />it was Kaladi Sankara who revived the Sanathana Dharma after the <br />onslaught of Jainisma and Buddhism in South India. It is the same <br />Kaladi Sankara who stuck to Nirguna Brahmam and also had a Saguna <br />Brahmam and said "Bhaja Govindam, Bhaja Govindam, Govindam Bhaja <br />mooDa mathE". So if at all there was another Sankara who wrote <br />Lalitha Sahasranamam etc, he must have been after this Kaladi <br />Sankara. But I am sure that the Global view is that, it is the same <br />Kaladi Sankara, who wrote these slokas as well. </p>
<p>++++++++++++Quote++++++++++++++++++<br />In addition, the first Shankara may also have been the author of </p>
<blockquote><p>  Bhagavad Gita, and introduced it into Mahabharatha, in order to <br />make <br />  the Vedic truths accessible to common man.<br />+++++++++++Unquote+++++++++++++++++</p></blockquote>
<p>What is the basis on which this claim is made. Is there any <br />reference to, even an existence of such belief? And if this is <br />accepted for argument sake, then the followers of Sankara, could not <br />be Saivites and they have to be only Vaishnavites and we all <br />probably know what is written in Gita. Well, I am not intending on a <br />pan-religion or pan-sect debate here, but am only trying to list the <br />reasons, why Sankara could not be BCE.</p>

<p>  Shall I add two more tangents to the debate? :)</p>
<p>  Maybe the more knowledgeable among you can help throw some light!</p>
<p>  Take a deep breath!</p>
<p>  1. Prophet Mohammed is also considered a avatar by some Islamic <br />  folks. <a href="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/comparative/scriptures.htm" title="http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/comparative/scriptures.htm">http://islamicweb.com/beliefs/comparative/scriptures.htm</a><br />  Apparently, Atharva veda, Mahabharat, etc predicted a "mlechcha" <br />  avatar (mlechcha meaning somebody not following the Vedic <br />tradition) <br />  and the descriptions match the Prophet.<br />  Why not? </p>
<p>  2. Regarding Shankara disputing Buddhism, my dad has heard some <br />  claims that there were actually two Sankaras.<br />  - one who propounded the pure(kevala) advaitha tradition, wrote <br />the <br />  commentaries for Upanishads, Brahma sutras and philosophical works <br />  like Viveka Chudamani. This Shankara may have believed only in a <br />  Nirguna Brahmam (attribute-less God). He may have been born in BCE <br />  during the reign on Vikramaditya according to records in Shringeri <br />  mutt. He may have either set up the mutts or have been part of the <br />  mutt system set up by somebody else.</p>
<p>  - the other, who wrote all the devotional hymns like Soundarya <br />  Lahiri, Subramanya Bhujangam, was the one born in Kaladi. He may <br />have <br />  believed in the need for a Saguna Brahmam (God with a form). He <br />may <br />  also have joined the established mutt system, and was probably <br />born <br />  in the generally accepted date of 700 CE. He may have revived the <br />  meemansa (rituals) part of Hinduism as a way to counteract <br />Buddhism. </p>
<p>  Since our best source of Sankara's life is the Sankara Digvijayam, <br />  which is basically a hagiograhy written nearly a century after his <br />  eath, anything is possible!</p>
<p>  In addition, the first Shankara may also have been the author of <br />  Bhagavad Gita, and introduced it into Mahabharatha, in order to <br />make <br />  the Vedic truths accessible to common man. </p>

        <p>Deepa, thank you. Am not sure if the idea of 'avatar' as propogated by islamic religions is the same as our 'avatars' atleast ethically. Our avatars do not claim to be the 'only way' or no exclusivity is claimed while abrahamic faiths do claim exclusivity.<br />?<br />The idea of Sri Sankara being two different people and one who introduced Gita to Mahabharat sounds quite possible to me.<br />?<br />We can talk much on these lines. Buddhism is a non theistic religion, not an atheistic religion. It is the only religion accepted by scientists as valid in addressing issues around human mind. It addresses the human conditionunlike the 'other world' promised by other religions including our own vedic tradition. If we regard the 'sambavami yuge yuge' definition to mean an avatar, Gautama Buddha is an avatar who saved many lives and continues to do so with his teachings. Of course others including followers of Muhammaed can make these claims as well.<br />?<br />Lastly there are orthodox hindus and orthodox buddhists. Orthodox hindus regard any challenge to vedic beliefs as non hindu, orthodox buddhists on theother hand regard any belief in addition to their own as non buddhist.As long as these people exist it would be impossible to find any definite correlation to Buddha and Sri Vishnu. But we can still persist because so many people starting from Jayadeva, Gandhi, etc did believe in both Rama and Buddha at the same time.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>1.

<p>2. Regarding Shankara disputing Buddhism, my dad has heard some <br />claims that there were actually two Sankaras.<br />- one who propounded the pure(kevala) advaitha tradition, wrote the <br />commentaries for Upanishads, Brahma sutras and philosophical works <br />like Viveka Chudamani. This Shankara may have believed only in a <br />Nirguna Brahmam (attribute-less God). He may have been born in BCE <br />during the reign on Vikramaditya according to records in Shringeri <br />mutt. He may have either set up the mutts or have been part of the <br />mutt system set up by somebody else.</p>
<p>- the other, who wrote all the devotional hymns like Soundarya <br />Lahiri, Subramanya Bhujangam, was the one born in Kaladi. He may have <br />believed in the need for a Saguna Brahmam (God with a form). He may <br />also have joined the established mutt system, and was probably born <br />in the generally accepted date of 700 CE. He may have revived the <br />meemansa (rituals) part of Hinduism as a way to counteract Buddhism. </p>
<p>Since our best source of Sankara's life is the Sankara Digvijayam, <br />which is basically a hagiograhy written nearly a century after his <br />eath, anything is possible!</p>
<p>In addition, the first Shankara may also have been the author of <br />Bhagavad Gita, and introduced it into Mahabharatha, in order to make <br />the Vedic truths accessible to common man. </p>

        <p>Dear SPS, Hinduism has never mandated a belief in a personal God, it is only some sects of Hinduism that perceive it this way. The Ramayana itself hasan athiest 'rishi' named Jabala who disputes Sri Rama's unconditional belief in God/among other things.<br />?<br />The 'athiesm' as purported by Buddha is a non belief in a personal God, Buddhism perceives God as the great mounam or ultimate reality and beleives all truths can be found within self by?true self seeking and destroying thego.?Buddhism does not believe anything is permanent including a personalGod with certain characteristics. Adi Sankara's Adwaita philosophy also believes in the 'great mounam' as the ultimate reality, although there are subtle differences in what that reality might be.<br />?<br />Buddhism is not an 'athiestic' religion as commonly believed, it is a radically different belief system that is all which can perhaps be understood better by Hindus with some meditation practice and studying Ramana/ J Krishnamoorthy etc. Those people who are very carried away by a personal God and?rituals that emphasise beliefs rather than self seeking?will defintelyfind it very difficult. I will write more on opening lines and what they mean later.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>The Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu<br />Author: A Seshan <br />Publication: The Times of India <br />Date: May 7, 2001 <br />THE story of Gautama, the Buddha (the enlightened one), is well <br />known. He expounded the four noble truths (Arya Satya) concerning <br />suffering, its cause, its destruction and the way to the elimination <br />of sorrow. He was against the extremes of both self-indulgence and <br />self-mortification. A Middle Path was advocated consisting of right <br />views, right aspirations, right speech, right conduct, right <br />livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right contemplation. <br />He rejected the authority of the Vedas, condemned ritualistic <br />practices, especially animal sacrifice, and denied the existence of <br />gods. Buddhism flourished for more than a millennium and spread to <br />foreign lands also. But a decline set in after the Golden Age of the <br />Guptas (4th to 5th centuries AD). </p>
<p>Foreign historians, with limited knowledge of Indian philosophical <br />systems, have attributed the decline of Buddhism in the land of its <br />birth to the advent of Adi Sankara. The 68th Sankaracharya of the <br />Kanchi Kamakoti Math, Shri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, has <br />effectively nailed this canard. According to him, Sankara was more <br />concerned with setting right the errors in Saankhya and Meemaamsa <br />philosophies of Hinduism which denied the importance of Isvara <br />though basically subscribing to the Vedas. Even where he <br />specifically dealt with Buddhism, he condemned only its denial of <br />the existence of God. Then how did the religion decline? It was <br />because of the vehement opposition to Buddhism on philosophical and <br />religious grounds by Meemaamsakas and Taarkikas (logicians). </p>
<p>The point is also that, even as people admired Buddha and turned to <br />his religion, they did not give up their old beliefs and ritualistic <br />practices. To give a contemporary example, many call themselves <br />Gandhians but in their lives, official or personal, they follow a <br />path just the opposite of what he showed! King Ashoka (2nd century <br />BC) did much to propagate the religion within India and without. <br />Still in his rock edicts he calls himself as "Devanampiya" or "the <br />beloved of the gods". There were no gods in Buddhism at his time. So <br />obviously he was referring to Hindu gods. In other words, he <br />continued to believe in Hindu religion even as he admired Buddha. <br />Buddhist texts written by bikshus have a Saraswati stotra in the <br />beginning paying obeisance to the Hindu goddess of learning. It is <br />not unusual to see an idol of Lord Ganesh in a Buddhist temple. </p>
<p>Adi Sankara accepted the tenets of Buddhism at the level of pure <br />consciousness. The ultimate stage in his philosophy was the giving <br />up of rituals and concentrating the mind on the infinite. Buddha <br />wanted his followers to take a quantum leap at the initial stage <br />itself to this ultimate goal, something which is difficult to expect <br />of ordinary men and women. Sankara advocated abiding by the karmas, <br />as stipulated by Meemaamsa, to begin with, and proceeding gradually <br />to the stage envisaged by Buddha of giving them up altogether. <br />However, Buddha did believe in two cardinal principles of Hinduism, <br />viz. the transmigration of the soul and the law of karma (that our <br />actions have consequences). Thus fundamentally there is little <br />difference between the two religions except that Buddha conceived <br />his as an ethical and secular way of life. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most important reason for the decline of Buddhism as a <br />separate religion was the absorption of its founder in the Hindu <br />pantheon of gods - indeed an irony for one who denied their <br />existence! There are many incarnations of Vishnu of which the <br />Dasavatar or the ten incarnations are the most well known. In the <br />Southern tradition they are: matsya (fish), koorma (tortoise), <br />varaha (boar), Narasimha (the man-lion), Vamana (the dwarf) <br />Parasurama (the angry prince), Rama (the perfect human), Balarama, <br />his younger brother Krishna (the divine statesman) and Kalki (the <br />redeemer of righteousness in the kali yuga, who is yet to appear). <br />In the Northern tradition Balarama is replaced by Buddha who appears <br />as the ninth avatar after Krishna, his mission being to purify <br />Hinduism. Srimad Bhagavatam (circa 900 AD, according to Farquhar) <br />takes the stand that Krishna is the original form of Vishnu and the <br />incarnations were all his. In its list of Dasavatar, which many <br />consider as the most authentic, both Baladeva (or Balarama) and <br />Buddha appear. Krishna is not mentioned because he is the original <br />god. The Dasavatara Stotra of Jayadev (12th century), parts of which <br />are included in Adi Guru Granth compiled by Guru Arjun Singh, <br />follows the list of Bhagavatam. In this scheme, Buddhism was like <br />the reformation movement of Martin Luther in Christianity. Once <br />Buddha himself became an incarnation of Vishnu there was no need for <br />the religion to exist separately in this country. </p>
