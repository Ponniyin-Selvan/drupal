<p>Hi</p>
<p>As most of you know the great Chennai book fair<br />starts on Jan 4, 2008. </p>
<p>I would like to find a few books and which stall they<br />may be available especially 'Vichitra chithan',<br />Diwakar's works and has Gokul's novels published<br />already?</p>
<p>Also as we have so many authors here, can we list some<br />interesting but may be hard-to-find books that might<br />be available this time in the fair?</p>

        <p>First some blasting:</p>
<p>Since there are too many stalls and visitors have very<br />little time for everything, I think it is the<br />responsibility of the stall keepers to arrange books<br />properly as per author or subject. Most stalls were<br />just dumping the books - making them less visible to<br />interested persons.</p>
<p>In one of the rows, they have dumped name boards on<br />the middle of the walk way and expected visitors to be<br />good athelets and able to be jump and leap.</p>
<p>Some stalls were overcrowded for their size - for<br />example Ananda viketan. I guess they are running these<br />stalls successfully continuously for several years.<br />Can they not book a bigger stall ?</p>
<p>And some suggestions:</p>
<p>1) Promote theme stalls ( for example theological )<br />2) A guide to the book exhibition - key stalls and<br />what they have on display - can be published in<br />leading news papers or given away free or as inserts<br />to news papers / neighborhood times. I saw some<br />special column in Dinamalar. But it was not detailed.<br />3) Move to a better exhibition ground such as the<br />Chennai Trade Center where things can be arranged in a<br />better manner and service could start at 9AM</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi venkatachalam </p>
<p>  the crowd was okay but because of too many stalls<br />  was dissipated. <br />  also the rains and the rather difficult approach to<br />  the main stalls <br />  were impediments.</p>
<p>  true buyers came at 11 and spent time till the<br />  evening. our members <br />  like v.k and arunachalam would go for a round and<br />  buy books and leave <br />  it at my stall. then go for another round.sps had<br />  brought a man to <br />  carry the books he had bought.</p>
<p>  my assesment was every publisher had a complaint<br />  that the new books <br />  given for printing didnt turn up from the presses-<br />  mainly because the <br />  date of the book fair was advanced by a week ( from<br />  last year's 10th <br />  jan to 4th jan) the printers had a clash between<br />  theese and the <br />  regular diaries.</p>
<p>  anyway a lot of publishers did do roaring business.<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>    Hi,<br />    Publishers felt that this year the crowd<br />  is less in <br />  bookfair. One of the reason is that they quoted is,<br />  tamil books are <br />  available in many shpos these days. </p>
<p>    Did anyone buy the book "Yamam" by<br />  S.Ramakrishnan. It is a story <br />  based on chennai's history. I felt the story is<br />  really good.</p>

<p>    Hi Sivaram Kannan,</p>
<p>    Greetings..</p>
<p>    Good thought.</p>
<p>    Personally instead of sending Greeting Cards (now<br />  that we changed <br />  to <br />    SMS / Emails) I purchase Books (around Rs. 100 or<br />  less) and gift .. <br />    It can be 1 or 10.. but that habit helps some one.</p>
<p>    I have done this for Dr. Kalikkovan's books.. Dr.<br />  Kudavoil / Dr. <br />    Nagaswwamy's books ..</p>
<p>    I presented " Foundation of Tamil Arts : by Dr.<br />  Nagaswamy " to a <br />  very <br />    POPULAR personality recently..</p>
<p>    These are all to create more awareness ..</p>
<p>    This year the VAZHIKAATTI published by Chennnai -<br />  Canara Bank <br />    official Mr. Saikumar, re Thirumuraithalangal -<br />  priced at Rs. 50 - <br />    with a Foreword by REACH Foundation is being<br />  gifted.</p>

<p>sps had brought a man to carry the books he had bought.</p>
<p>=================</p>
<p>That was mainly to commute to the Parking lot from Stall - Dear Venkat.</p>
<p>Interestingly I picked three books - One by Paul Brandon (Searching <br />Secrets of India - related to Mahaswamiji &amp; Ramanar ), one by <br />Ravishankar Guruji and third one :: 100 Kings &amp; Queens - near Thanjai <br />Bustand last Sunday - in a New Book stall !</p>
<p>Appears we should always look for and pick the books wee have been <br />waiting to read..</p>

          Chennai Book Fair - 2008        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi venkatachalam </p>
<p>the crowd was okay but because of too many stalls was dissipated. <br />also the rains and the rather difficult approach to the main stalls <br />were impediments.</p>
<p>true buyers came at 11 and spent time till the evening. our members <br />like v.k and arunachalam would go for a round and buy books and leave <br />it at my stall. then go for another round.sps had brought a man to <br />carry the books he had bought.</p>
<p>my assesment was every publisher had a complaint that the new books <br />given for printing didnt turn up from the presses- mainly because the <br />date of the book fair was advanced by a week ( from last year's 10th <br />jan to 4th jan) the printers had a clash between theese and the <br />regular diaries.</p>
<p>anyway a lot of publishers did do roaring business.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  Hi Sivaram Kannan,</p>
<p>  Greetings..</p>
<p>  Good thought.</p>
<p>  Personally instead of sending Greeting Cards (now that we changed <br />to <br />  SMS / Emails) I purchase Books (around Rs. 100 or less) and gift .. <br />  It can be 1 or 10.. but that habit helps some one.</p>
<p>  I have done this for Dr. Kalikkovan's books.. Dr. Kudavoil / Dr. <br />  Nagaswwamy's books ..</p>
<p>  I presented " Foundation of Tamil Arts : by Dr. Nagaswamy " to a <br />very <br />  POPULAR personality recently..</p>

          Chennai Book Fair - 2008        </div>

        <p>Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>Some how I could not visit the Book Fair yet. Thanks for the <br />coverage.</p>
<p>The link posted earlier is excellent.</p>
<p>Venkat's books are selling like HOT CAKES .. Very nice to know this <br />through several sources.</p>
<p>NDTV Vaidhyanathan will be in Chennai on the 16th / 17th Jan.</p>
<p>We will try to meet.</p>

<blockquote><p>  I went there yesterday and it is bigger than past<br />  years. 1 day is not enough to see everything.</p>
<p>  Try to visit small publishers' stalls - they have a<br />  variety. I found some interesting books by one<br />  "Meyyappan" publisher about Nadu Kal ( hero stone),<br />  Cheppedu (Copper Plates), Birds &amp; Plants of Tamilnadu<br />  etc., kept in a rather unnoticeable stall. These<br />  people seem to have a passion for books and need<br />  patronage.</p>
<p>  Some big time publishers such as "Vanathi" doesnt seem<br />  to have changed a lot or have a variety. Seems to be<br />  still counting on "Theivathin Kural" and some<br />  "Sandilyan" series primarily. A complete set of<br />  "Theivathin Kural" and "Kurai Onrum illai" will make a<br />  Hindu home completely blessed though.</p>
<p>  Palaniappa Bros - They are still publishing the series<br />  "Nattukku Ulaitha Nallavar." Guess this series is<br />  alive for more than 40 years. You can buy "Madrasa<br />  Pattanam" book by Narasiah here.</p>
<p>  At Viketan stall, you can book the Tamil Encyclopedia<br />  for Rs. 3000.</p>
<p>  At another unnoticeable stall, they were keeping the<br />  books on Tamilnadu Coinage by Dinamalar Editor, only a<br />  few copies were found though. His latest book on "Late<br />  Roman Coins on Tamil Nadu" is very well illustrated<br />  and printed nicely.</p>
<p>  PS books are still an attraction and lot of stalls are<br />  keeping our Venkat's "Kaviri Mainthan." I was at his<br />  stall for sometime and I could see lot of interest on<br />  this book. Copies were getting evacuated pretty fast!<br />  &amp; thanks to him for allowing me to keep my bounty at<br />  his stall for sometime that I could go for 2nd and 3rd<br />  rounds.</p>
<p>  Many stalls are keeping NCBH's "Cholarkal VOl 1 and<br />  vol 2" in Tamil. People buying this book also take a<br />  look at "History of Tamilnadu, Chola Peru Venthar<br />  Kalam" - this is a 2 Volume book, authentic and<br />  available in a stall by Institute of Tamil Studies.</p>
<p>  3 years ago, I made a complaint to several book<br />  publishers about non availability of Tamil book for<br />  children of the age 3-10 years and asked them to<br />  compare with that in English. They all said "who<br />  buys?" I could see a difference now - there are lot of<br />  books in Tamil for our children now.</p>
<p>  There are lot of CDs for pre &amp; primary school children<br />  too in Tamil.</p>
<p>  1 question still haunts me... There are thousands and<br />  thousands of books printed and kept here by desperate,<br />  passionate publishers and authors. Will they ever be<br />  able to sell these books and atleast take their<br />  investment ? </p>
<p>  Buying a book will certainly help somebody in the<br />  chain to earn a meal.</p>

<p>          Hello Sps Sir and forumers,</p>
<p>          I have been a very active reader of this<br />    group. Thanks to one of<br />        the mails that I read in this group I was able<br />    to recoginize<br />      Kaviri<br />        Maindhan and I bought the entire pack.<br />          Also, I went to University publications to<br />    get KAN's Colas, but<br />      it<br />        had got sold out by the time i went. I had got<br />    KAN's Foreign<br />        References of South INdia instead. I also<br />    bought a few of Sundara<br />        Ramaswamy's and came back.</p>
<p>          All this thanks to the references from this<br />    forum.</p>
<p>          I was disappointed that none of the PS books<br />    there had come with<br />        the paintings published in Kalki periodical. If<br />    anyone can let me<br />        know of such a publication I would deeply<br />    appreciate.</p>
<p>          I will post my comments on Kavirini Maindhan<br />    once I complete it.</p>
<p>          warm regards<br />          Balaji</p>

        <p>I am really missing the book fair this year and all your <br />descriptions makes me more frustrated. Anyway, good to atleast hear <br />about this.</p>
<p>Well said udanx. Reading is an addiction. I do buy most of the books <br />from book fair and some from the stalls as well but I am not that <br />kind of reader like many in these forum. But many of the books I <br />buy, i take years to read :)</p>
<p>You are from Dindigul? Must be knowing KVN sons on the main bazaar <br />road? Its my brother in laws firm, he is one of the partners. My <br />sister lives in Dindigul and I do visit her quite often.</p>

          Chennai Book Fair - 2008        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Visited the fair last weekend. Got hold of a few books.<br />Bought 'Divakar's Vichitra chittan. Yet to start reading.<br />One of the things I am reading these days is not the history of the <br />kings and dynasties but that of the ordinary people at different <br />times. So was looking for the books and surprisingly found many in <br />Tamil.<br />1. A.K.Perumals books - All are based on the local deities worshipped <br />in various parts of tamil nadu and the history of how these worship <br />came about. Bought 'Kodungollur Kannagiyin kathai' 'Naattar pen <br />deivangal' and a couple more.<br />2. Christhuvamum Jathiyamum - This is related to the building and <br />demlition of the wall in the Vadakkankulam church. <br />3. Muthammal sarithiram - Written by a Malay coolie's wife about the <br />initial days of immigration from Tamilnadu to Malaya in the 18th <br />century.<br />Apart from that bought books by Saavi, autobiographies by Salim Ali <br />and Jim Corbett, few novels and essays on the history of southern <br />tamil nadu. Will try to write on atleast a few of these items in the <br />coming days.<br />Overall, I found the fair a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of disappointment. May be I went with <br />high expectations.</acronym></p>
<p>On the brighter side, here is a useful link<br /><a href="http://www.chennailibrary.com/" title="http://www.chennailibrary.com/">http://www.chennailibrary.com/</a><br />They have the entire set of Kalki and pudhumaipithan's stories online <br />in Tamil.</p>

<p>Venkatesh,</p>
<p>I OBJECT YOUR HONOUR. If not all the 25K people there are people inmy<br />relatives circle who wait for the book fair and are also frequent visitors<br />to book store. Books are a kind of addiction just like any other addiction.<br />My point is connoisseurs are still out there. Yes this IT boom has produced<br />more pseudo connoisseur around. But one thing that makes me happy is that<br />whether be it Tamizh or English the reading habit is still there even in the<br />GeNEXT ... The success of Harry Potter is one good example. Whether they<br />read it out of passion or peer pressure, the kids read and discuss the story<br />and description. That makes me feel happy</p>

        <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I went to the book fair last Sunday. It was an ocean of books. I was <br />lucky enough to grab a copy of "The Chozhas" (Colas sounds strange to <br />me) by NKS at the Madras Univ. stall. There were only two copies <br />available at that time. The university can concentrate on the print <br />quality of the book. The printing technology has grown leaps and <br />bounds over the last decade or so thanks to computer-based <br />publishing, yet the printing quality of the book especially the <br />pictures sections is not eye catching. It is readable though. Of <br />course, content is king and content on our great Chozhas is certainly <br />emperor. I was there for nearly 3.5 hours, but that was not enough. <br />May visit the fair again this weekend.</p>

<p>for 4 days I have been sitting in the fair. I am off to sikkim <br />tomorrow . will miss the crowds.</p>

<p>      VK sir,</p>
<p>        1 question still haunts me... There are<br />  thousands<br />      and<br />        thousands of books printed and kept here by<br />      desperate,<br />        passionate publishers and authors. Will they<br />  ever<br />      be<br />        able to sell these books and atleast take<br />  their<br />        investment ?</p>
<p>        Buying a book will certainly help somebody in<br />  the<br />        chain to earn a meal.</p>
<p>      I came out of the fair with the same question in<br />      mind. Also I wonder,<br />      whether the book fair is the only place where<br />  the<br />      tamil books are<br />      being bought by the public? Just taking me it<br />  has<br />      been years since I<br />      bought a tamil book at a shop and it is the 3rd<br />  year<br />      in a row that I<br />      am buying the books from this fair. Has anyone<br />  felt<br />      the same way??</p>

<blockquote><p>  1 question still haunts me... There are thousands and<br />  thousands of books printed and kept here by desperate,<br />  passionate publishers and authors. Will they ever be<br />  able to sell these books and atleast take their<br />  investment ?</p>
<p>  Buying a book will certainly help somebody in the<br />  chain to earn a meal.</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>I came out of the fair with the same question in mind. Also I wonder,<br />whether the book fair is the only place where the tamil books are<br />being bought by the public? Just taking me it has been years since I<br />bought a tamil book at a shop and it is the 3rd year in a row that I<br />am buying the books from this fair. Has anyone felt the same way??</p>

          Chennai Book Fair - 2008        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I went there yesterday and it is bigger than past<br />years. 1 day is not enough to see everything.</p>
<p>Try to visit small publishers' stalls - they have a<br />variety. I found some interesting books by one<br />"Meyyappan" publisher about Nadu Kal ( hero stone),<br />Cheppedu (Copper Plates), Birds &amp; Plants of Tamilnadu<br />etc., kept in a rather unnoticeable stall. These<br />people seem to have a passion for books and need<br />patronage.</p>
<p>Some big time publishers such as "Vanathi" doesnt seem<br />to have changed a lot or have a variety. Seems to be<br />still counting on "Theivathin Kural" and some<br />"Sandilyan" series primarily. A complete set of<br />"Theivathin Kural" and "Kurai Onrum illai" will make a<br />Hindu home completely blessed though.</p>
<p>Palaniappa Bros - They are still publishing the series<br />"Nattukku Ulaitha Nallavar." Guess this series is<br />alive for more than 40 years. You can buy "Madrasa<br />Pattanam" book by Narasiah here.</p>
<p>At Viketan stall, you can book the Tamil Encyclopedia<br />for Rs. 3000.</p>
<p>At another unnoticeable stall, they were keeping the<br />books on Tamilnadu Coinage by Dinamalar Editor, only a<br />few copies were found though. His latest book on "Late<br />Roman Coins on Tamil Nadu" is very well illustrated<br />and printed nicely.</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  books are still an attraction and lot of stalls are<br />keeping our Venkat's "Kaviri Mainthan." I was at his<br />stall for sometime and I could see lot of interest on<br />this book. Copies were getting evacuated pretty fast!<br />&amp; thanks to him for allowing me to keep my bounty at<br />his stall for sometime that I could go for 2nd and 3rd<br />rounds.</acronym></p>
<p>Many stalls are keeping NCBH's "Cholarkal VOl 1 and<br />vol 2" in Tamil. People buying this book also take a<br />look at "History of Tamilnadu, Chola Peru Venthar<br />Kalam" - this is a 2 Volume book, authentic and<br />available in a stall by Institute of Tamil Studies.</p>
<p>3 years ago, I made a complaint to several book<br />publishers about non availability of Tamil book for<br />children of the age 3-10 years and asked them to<br />compare with that in English. They all said "who<br />buys?" I could see a difference now - there are lot of<br />books in Tamil for our children now.</p>
<p>There are lot of CDs for pre &amp; primary school children<br />too in Tamil.</p>
<p>1 question still haunts me... There are thousands and<br />thousands of books printed and kept here by desperate,<br />passionate publishers and authors. Will they ever be<br />able to sell these books and atleast take their<br />investment ? </p>
<p>Buying a book will certainly help somebody in the<br />chain to earn a meal.</p>

<p>        Hello Sps Sir and forumers,</p>
<p>        I have been a very active reader of this<br />  group. Thanks to one of<br />      the mails that I read in this group I was able<br />  to recoginize<br />    Kaviri<br />      Maindhan and I bought the entire pack.<br />        Also, I went to University publications to<br />  get KAN's Colas, but<br />    it<br />      had got sold out by the time i went. I had got<br />  KAN's Foreign<br />      References of South INdia instead. I also<br />  bought a few of Sundara<br />      Ramaswamy's and came back.</p>
<p>        All this thanks to the references from this<br />  forum.</p>
<p>        I was disappointed that none of the PS books<br />  there had come with<br />      the paintings published in Kalki periodical. If<br />  anyone can let me<br />      know of such a publication I would deeply<br />  appreciate.</p>
<p>        I will post my comments on Kavirini Maindhan<br />  once I complete it.</p>
<p>        warm regards<br />        Balaji</p>

<p>      Hello Sps Sir and forumers,</p>
<p>      I have been a very active reader of this group. Thanks to one of<br />    the mails that I read in this group I was able to recoginize<br />  Kaviri<br />    Maindhan and I bought the entire pack.<br />      Also, I went to University publications to get KAN's Colas, but<br />  it<br />    had got sold out by the time i went. I had got KAN's Foreign<br />    References of South INdia instead. I also bought a few of Sundara<br />    Ramaswamy's and came back.</p>
<p>      All this thanks to the references from this forum.</p>
<p>      I was disappointed that none of the PS books there had come with<br />    the paintings published in Kalki periodical. If anyone can let me<br />    know of such a publication I would deeply appreciate.</p>
<p>      I will post my comments on Kavirini Maindhan once I complete it.</p>
<p>      warm regards<br />      Balaji</p>

<p>Hello Sps Sir and forumers,</p>
<p>I have been a very active reader of this group. Thanks to one of the mails that I read in this group I was able to recoginize Kaviri Maindhan and I bought the entire pack.<br />Also, I went to University publications to get <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym 's Colas, but it had got sold out by the time i went. I had got <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym 's Foreign References of South INdia instead. I also bought a few of Sundara Ramaswamy's and came back.</p>
<p>All this thanks to the references from this forum.</p>
<p>I was disappointed that none of the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  books there had come with the paintings published in Kalki periodical. If anyone can let me know of such a publication I would deeply appreciate.</p>
<p>I will post my comments on Kavirini Maindhan once I complete it.</p>
<p>warm regards<br />Balaji</p>

<p>        As most of you know the great Chennai book fair<br />        starts on Jan 4, 2008.</p>
<p>        I would like to find a few books and which stall they<br />        may be available especially 'Vichitra chithan',<br />        Diwakar's works and has Gokul's novels published<br />        already?</p>
<p>        Also as we have so many authors here, can we list some<br />        interesting but may be hard-to-find books that might<br />        be available this time in the fair?</p>

          Chennai Book Fair - 2008        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hello Sps Sir and forumers,</p>
<p>I have been a very active reader of this group. Thanks to one of the mails that I read in this group I was able to recoginize Kaviri Maindhan and I bought the entire pack.<br />Also, I went to University publications to get <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym 's Colas, but it had got sold out by the time i went. I had got <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym 's Foreign References of South INdia instead. I also bought a few of Sundara Ramaswamy's and came back.</p>
<p>All this thanks to the references from this forum.</p>
<p>I was disappointed that none of the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  books there had come with the paintings published in Kalki periodical. If anyone can let me know of such a publication I would deeply appreciate.</p>
<p>I will post my comments on Kavirini Maindhan once I complete it.</p>
<p>warm regards<br />Balaji</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>just back from the book fair. cM did not come because of the rains.<br />but the stalls are open.</p>
<p>10% discount is mandatory. but many give a little more because of the <br />change problem.</p>
<p>I am repeating, there are 6 entrances and 6 exits. duruing the big <br />crowd time you may be able to see only half the stalls.<br />so make it a point to visit it in the mornings on holidays, and <br />afternoons on working days</p>

        <p>Theres a standard 10% off on all books... but the publishers also add other<br />discounts... last time I got a technical book worth 250 for 75... but not<br />all books are available at throwaway prices... you can expect a 10-20% off<br />on most books.</p>
<p>The stalls last years were by publisher... am guessing it would be the same<br />this year too...</p>

<p>  As most of you know the great Chennai book fair<br />  starts on Jan 4, 2008. </p>
<p>  I would like to find a few books and which stall they<br />  may be available especially 'Vichitra chithan',<br />  Diwakar's works and has Gokul's novels published<br />  already?</p>
<p>  Also as we have so many authors here, can we list some<br />  interesting but may be hard-to-find books that might<br />  be available this time in the fair?</p>
