<p>April 10, 2008 </p>
<p>Mamallapuram, the ancient coastal city on the Bay of Bengal, is<br />remembered today as the Pallava kings' gift to Tamilnadu. Mamallapuram<br />was the dream of the visionary ruler Mahendra Pallavan who reigned in<br />the 6th / 7th century AD. He was a ruler who was loved by his people<br />and who worked tirelessly to maintain peace for his people for<br />twenty-five years ? when suddenly war loomed at his gates! King<br />Pulikesi of the neighboring Chalukya Empire, was almost at the<br />Pallava kingdom's door step with an menacing army of 16,000 elephants,<br />12,000 cavalry and over a lakh of foot soliders. News came as the<br />army had reached Tungabadra River! Facing certain defeat, King<br />Mahendra Pallava performed a magnificent feat of camouflage, secrecy<br />and political outmaneuvering to prolong peace for ten years, only to<br />lose his life in battle trying to save his beloved capital city Kanchi<br />? the Pallava capital. </p>
<p>This is the historical background that fuelled the brilliant mind of<br />Kalki Krishnamurthy for his memorable story SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM. One<br />of the most luminary writers of the 20th century, Kalki, as he was<br />called with affection and awe, wove spellbinding narratives creating<br />fictional characters located in actual historical times. 'Ponniyin<br />Selvan' and 'Parthiban Kanavu' are memorable for the richness of their<br />full blooded heroes and heroines located directly within actual<br />historical events of South India. The stories, serialized in the<br />immensely popular Tamil magazine Kalki, captured the imagination of an<br />entire generation of readers who would wait avidly for the next issue<br />of the magazine so that they could participate in the highs and lows<br />of the wonderfully etched characters. A runaway hit for 12 years was<br />his story of the dancing heroine of Kanchi, SIVAKMIYIN SAPATAM. The<br />human life drama woven into the story was so believable and intense<br />that millions were gripped with SIVAKAMI fever throughout these years,<br />many actually learning to read and enjoy the Tamil language through<br />the colourful saga of kings, war and power struggles.  </p>
<p>Across the Indian Ocean in nearby Singapore, the tale of Sivakami came<br />to life in the majestic Victoria Theatre on September 14 and 15, 2007.<br />Connecting the beloved tale to modern audiences, who barely have any<br />name recall for Kalki or his protagonist Sivakami, choreographer Neila<br />Sathyalingam presented her vision of the story that has fascinated her<br />ever since she was a student in Kalakshetra in the 60s... Through a<br />sweeping 3 hour dance-theatre spectacle titled SIVKAMI, the dual<br />language operatic presentation contained English dialogues and Tamil<br />lyrics. </p>
<p>A multiple award winning choreographer and cultural icon in Singapore<br />for over 30 years, Neila Sathyalingam has a penchant for large brush<br />strokes, having prepared dancers and floats for the annual Chingay<br />Chinese New Year processions down Orchard Road. The 65 actors and<br />dancers filled Victoria Theatre's majestic proscenium stage with the<br />throbbing spectacle of ambition, power, heroics and cunning. There<br />were so many memorable scenes, the major one for this writer being the<br />coming alive of the dance sculptures during the dream of sculptor<br />Ayanar ? a moment that sent a 'frisson' through the audience who then<br />burst into spontaneous applause! </p>
<p>Reflecting Singaporean multicultural elements of Chinese / Malay /<br />Thai / Tamil craft and dance traditions into a cohesive whole is<br />difficult enough. One sees so much of work today in the name of<br />'globalization' that is often a mere pastiche and an unconvincing<br />mess. The intensity of Kalki's dialogue and the continuing horror of<br />war and bloodshed created an authentic slice of history as well as<br />painting a powerful contemporary metaphor about the futility of<br />battle. Through 21 scenes broken up into 4 acts with an intermission,<br />international audiences ? many of them Europeans ? were introduced for<br />the first time to a modern adaptation of this Tamil literary classic.  </p>
<p>Krishnakshi, the guest artiste from India, as Sivakami was simply<br />superb. Through dance and dialogues, she held her own throughout the<br />play. Dedicated as the epitome of beauty, grace and the very soul of<br />the capital city Kanchi, Sivakami finds herself alone and abandoned<br />through the vagaries of fate and her own pride. In her final days, she<br />immerses herself in the service of Lord Ekambareswarar. Alone but not<br />forgotten, an iconic image representing an era of grace that ended<br />with an avoidable tragedy! Krishnakshi carried the character on her<br />expressive shoulders with maturity and a magnificent stage presence.  </p>
<p>Selvanathan as Naganandhi was a convincing actor who conveyed his love<br />for art and his affinity for scheming. In the pivotal role as the<br />monk-brother of the marauding ruler Pulikesi, the struggle between his<br />love of art and duty to his brother was convincingly portrayed.<br />Noteworthy were his voice modulations during the furtive mourning of<br />Sivakami ? the 'Kanchi Sundari,' who swoons after dancing on the<br />streets all day to save her people while his brother, the heartless<br />King Pulikesi threatens to torture the citizens of Kanchi, was<br />brilliant.  </p>
<p>Sivakumar as Pulikesi, Emperor of the Chalukyas, who ravages Kanchi<br />and razes this enchanted city to the ground, was played with mature<br />measure and restraint. As the symbol of ego and ravenous pride,<br />Sivakumar maintained this clear diction throughout the play. The<br />moment when he holds the conquered Sivakami's face in his hands and<br />asks sarcastically, "Is it your youth or your art that makes my<br />brother Naganandi forget all his duties?" was performed with the<br />coiled anger of a merciless ruler. </p>
<p>Pallava King Mahendravarman was played by actor Mathialagan who was<br />truly outstanding. An award winning actor on stage and TV, Mathialagan<br />brought great dignity to his all important role. As the spy Vajra Bahu<br />and as king of Kanchi, he held his own and manipulated his<br />conversations with seasoned maturity. As the king he was regal, as the<br />spy/strategist he conveyed the zeal and manipulative mind of an<br />informer. His body language was convincing as was his dialogue<br />delivery in English. A pivotal double role played to perfection that<br />gave audiences a character who was so deeply invested in his kingdom<br />and his people. Through his portrayal, the rapt audience felt his<br />palpable love for his capital city eulogized by poets in these<br />memorable words... <br />"Pushpeshi Jaati, Purusheshu Vishnu <br />Naareeshu Rambha, Nagareshu Kanchi" </p>
<p>The crowd scenes during battles were particularly well directed, with<br />entries and exits always neat and well rehearsed. This spoke of the<br />choreographer's vast experience with a large cast and artistes from<br />varied linguistic and cultural backgrounds.  </p>
<p>The Ravindra Drama group of Singapore collaborated with Neila<br />Sathyalingam's Apsara Arts dancers for this mammoth venture. The<br />m?lange of dance and theatre, of spoken text and the sung/danced lyric<br />never outshone one another. This delicate balance was maintained<br />throughout, heightened by the multicultural orchestral score composed<br />by L Krishnan and Aravinth Kumaraswamy, gripping dialogues by Chennai<br />Koothu-P-Pattarai's Kumaravel, and lavish costumes designed by Neila<br />Sathyalingam.  </p>
<p>The two performances were graced by two special dignitaries. On<br />opening night it was Mr. Tharman Shanmugharatnam, Minister for<br />Education and Second Minister of Finance. On the second day, Mr. Tommy<br />Koh, Chairman National Heritage Board. Both men were lavish in their<br />praise of Neila Sathyalingam's unswerving zeal for the promotion of<br />Indian dance and music in the rapidly changing face of Singapore. </p>
<p>The spectacular scenography for SIVAKAMI spoke of the 2-year<br />preparation Neila Sathyalingam and her able team had invested for this<br />production. For Neila, this is her swan song, or so she says. A<br />student of Kalakshetra for more than 20 years during the most creative<br />time of its founder Rukmini Arundale, Neila imbibed "Atthai's"<br />pan-Asian aesthetic while the legendary Ramayana series was being<br />created and performed. Always open to new influences within the<br />parameters of what is 'auchitya' or appropriate, all of Neila's<br />earlier productions reflect her open mindedness and her love of new<br />ideas and approaches to dance creation. In fact, she is a rare guru<br />who always watches the works of younger dancers in any genre ?<br />classical, traditional, modern and contemporary! SIVAKAMI's<br />multicultural cast of Malays, Chinese and Indians also drew on each<br />culture's specialization in martial arts, movement vocabularies and<br />costume elements, which gave the show a truly Singaporean soul. </p>
<p>Neila is acutely conscious of her Tamil roots and the rapidly<br />declining readership among Singaporean and global youth for classical<br />literature. Through SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM, she hoped to make her own<br />favourite serial reawaken her personal beliefs and love of India, the<br />land that is 'bhakti naadu,' 'pannbu naadu,' 'maanam maryada naadu.'  </p>
<p>For this writer, having witnessed so many dance and music performances<br />over 50 years in Tamilnadu, the diasporic verve and old-world<br />commitment of the dancers and actors were most touching. Through<br />dance, music and theatre, these Singaporeans maintain contact with the<br />motherland they have all left behind many generations ago. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Ragothaman</p>

<p>  April 10, 2008 </p>
<p>  Mamallapuram, the ancient coastal city on the Bay of Bengal, is<br />  remembered today as the Pallava kings' gift to Tamilnadu. <br />Mamallapuram<br />  was the dream of the visionary ruler Mahendra Pallavan who reigned <br />in<br />  the 6th / 7th century AD. He was a ruler who was loved by his <br />people<br />  and who worked tirelessly to maintain peace for his people for<br />  twenty-five years ? when suddenly war loomed at his gates! King<br />  Pulikesi of the neighboring Chalukya Empire, was almost at the<br />  Pallava kingdom's door step with an menacing army of 16,000 <br />elephants,<br />  12,000 cavalry and over a lakh of foot soliders. News came as the<br />  army had reached Tungabadra River! Facing certain defeat, King<br />  Mahendra Pallava performed a magnificent feat of camouflage, secrecy<br />  and political outmaneuvering to prolong peace for ten years, only to<br />  lose his life in battle trying to save his beloved capital city <br />Kanchi<br />  ? the Pallava capital. </p>
<p>  This is the historical background that fuelled the brilliant mind of<br />  Kalki Krishnamurthy for his memorable story SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM. One<br />  of the most luminary writers of the 20th century, Kalki, as he was<br />  called with affection and awe, wove spellbinding narratives creating<br />  fictional characters located in actual historical times. 'Ponniyin<br />  Selvan' and 'Parthiban Kanavu' are memorable for the richness of <br />their<br />  full blooded heroes and heroines located directly within actual<br />  historical events of South India. The stories, serialized in the<br />  immensely popular Tamil magazine Kalki, captured the imagination of <br />an<br />  entire generation of readers who would wait avidly for the next <br />issue<br />  of the magazine so that they could participate in the highs and lows<br />  of the wonderfully etched characters. A runaway hit for 12 years was<br />  his story of the dancing heroine of Kanchi, SIVAKMIYIN SAPATAM. The<br />  human life drama woven into the story was so believable and intense<br />  that millions were gripped with SIVAKAMI fever throughout these <br />years,<br />  many actually learning to read and enjoy the Tamil language through<br />  the colourful saga of kings, war and power struggles.  </p>
<p>  Across the Indian Ocean in nearby Singapore, the tale of Sivakami <br />came<br />  to life in the majestic Victoria Theatre on September 14 and 15, <br />2007.<br />  Connecting the beloved tale to modern audiences, who barely have any<br />  name recall for Kalki or his protagonist Sivakami, choreographer <br />Neila<br />  Sathyalingam presented her vision of the story that has fascinated <br />her<br />  ever since she was a student in Kalakshetra in the 60s... Through a<br />  sweeping 3 hour dance-theatre spectacle titled SIVKAMI, the dual<br />  language operatic presentation contained English dialogues and Tamil<br />  lyrics. </p>
<p>  A multiple award winning choreographer and cultural icon in <br />Singapore<br />  for over 30 years, Neila Sathyalingam has a penchant for large brush<br />  strokes, having prepared dancers and floats for the annual Chingay<br />  Chinese New Year processions down Orchard Road. The 65 actors and<br />  dancers filled Victoria Theatre's majestic proscenium stage with the<br />  throbbing spectacle of ambition, power, heroics and cunning. There<br />  were so many memorable scenes, the major one for this writer being <br />the<br />  coming alive of the dance sculptures during the dream of sculptor<br />  Ayanar ? a moment that sent a 'frisson' through the audience who <br />then<br />  burst into spontaneous applause! </p>
<p>  Reflecting Singaporean multicultural elements of Chinese / Malay /<br />  Thai / Tamil craft and dance traditions into a cohesive whole is<br />  difficult enough. One sees so much of work today in the name of<br />  'globalization' that is often a mere pastiche and an unconvincing<br />  mess. The intensity of Kalki's dialogue and the continuing horror of<br />  war and bloodshed created an authentic slice of history as well as<br />  painting a powerful contemporary metaphor about the futility of<br />  battle. Through 21 scenes broken up into 4 acts with an <br />intermission,<br />  international audiences ? many of them Europeans ? were introduced <br />for<br />  the first time to a modern adaptation of this Tamil literary <br />classic.   </p>
<p>  Krishnakshi, the guest artiste from India, as Sivakami was simply<br />  superb. Through dance and dialogues, she held her own throughout the<br />  play. Dedicated as the epitome of beauty, grace and the very soul of<br />  the capital city Kanchi, Sivakami finds herself alone and abandoned<br />  through the vagaries of fate and her own pride. In her final days, <br />she<br />  immerses herself in the service of Lord Ekambareswarar. Alone but <br />not<br />  forgotten, an iconic image representing an era of grace that ended<br />  with an avoidable tragedy! Krishnakshi carried the character on her<br />  expressive shoulders with maturity and a magnificent stage <br />presence.  </p>
<p>  Selvanathan as Naganandhi was a convincing actor who conveyed his <br />love<br />  for art and his affinity for scheming. In the pivotal role as the<br />  monk-brother of the marauding ruler Pulikesi, the struggle between <br />his<br />  love of art and duty to his brother was convincingly portrayed.<br />  Noteworthy were his voice modulations during the furtive mourning of<br />  Sivakami ? the 'Kanchi Sundari,' who swoons after dancing on the<br />  streets all day to save her people while his brother, the heartless<br />  King Pulikesi threatens to torture the citizens of Kanchi, was<br />  brilliant.  </p>
<p>  Sivakumar as Pulikesi, Emperor of the Chalukyas, who ravages Kanchi<br />  and razes this enchanted city to the ground, was played with mature<br />  measure and restraint. As the symbol of ego and ravenous pride,<br />  Sivakumar maintained this clear diction throughout the play. The<br />  moment when he holds the conquered Sivakami's face in his hands and<br />  asks sarcastically, "Is it your youth or your art that makes my<br />  brother Naganandi forget all his duties?" was performed with the<br />  coiled anger of a merciless ruler. </p>
<p>  Pallava King Mahendravarman was played by actor Mathialagan who was<br />  truly outstanding. An award winning actor on stage and TV, <br />Mathialagan<br />  brought great dignity to his all important role. As the spy Vajra <br />Bahu<br />  and as king of Kanchi, he held his own and manipulated his<br />  conversations with seasoned maturity. As the king he was regal, as <br />the<br />  spy/strategist he conveyed the zeal and manipulative mind of an<br />  informer. His body language was convincing as was his dialogue<br />  delivery in English. A pivotal double role played to perfection that<br />  gave audiences a character who was so deeply invested in his kingdom<br />  and his people. Through his portrayal, the rapt audience felt his<br />  palpable love for his capital city eulogized by poets in these<br />  memorable words... <br />  "Pushpeshi Jaati, Purusheshu Vishnu <br />  Naareeshu Rambha, Nagareshu Kanchi" </p>
<p>  The crowd scenes during battles were particularly well directed, <br />with<br />  entries and exits always neat and well rehearsed. This spoke of the<br />  choreographer's vast experience with a large cast and artistes from<br />  varied linguistic and cultural backgrounds.  </p>
<p>  The Ravindra Drama group of Singapore collaborated with Neila<br />  Sathyalingam's Apsara Arts dancers for this mammoth venture. The<br />  m?lange of dance and theatre, of spoken text and the sung/danced <br />lyric<br />  never outshone one another. This delicate balance was maintained<br />  throughout, heightened by the multicultural orchestral score <br />composed<br />  by L Krishnan and Aravinth Kumaraswamy, gripping dialogues by <br />Chennai<br />  Koothu-P-Pattarai's Kumaravel, and lavish costumes designed by <br />Neila<br />  Sathyalingam.  </p>
<p>  The two performances were graced by two special dignitaries. On<br />  opening night it was Mr. Tharman Shanmugharatnam, Minister for<br />  Education and Second Minister of Finance. On the second day, Mr. <br />Tommy<br />  Koh, Chairman National Heritage Board. Both men were lavish in <br />their<br />  praise of Neila Sathyalingam's unswerving zeal for the promotion of<br />  Indian dance and music in the rapidly changing face of Singapore. </p>
<p>  The spectacular scenography for SIVAKAMI spoke of the 2-year<br />  preparation Neila Sathyalingam and her able team had invested for <br />this<br />  production. For Neila, this is her swan song, or so she says. A<br />  student of Kalakshetra for more than 20 years during the most <br />creative<br />  time of its founder Rukmini Arundale, Neila imbibed "Atthai's"<br />  pan-Asian aesthetic while the legendary Ramayana series was being<br />  created and performed. Always open to new influences within the<br />  parameters of what is 'auchitya' or appropriate, all of Neila's<br />  earlier productions reflect her open mindedness and her love of new<br />  ideas and approaches to dance creation. In fact, she is a rare guru<br />  who always watches the works of younger dancers in any genre ?<br />  classical, traditional, modern and contemporary! SIVAKAMI's<br />  multicultural cast of Malays, Chinese and Indians also drew on each<br />  culture's specialization in martial arts, movement vocabularies and<br />  costume elements, which gave the show a truly Singaporean soul. </p>
<p>  Neila is acutely conscious of her Tamil roots and the rapidly<br />  declining readership among Singaporean and global youth for <br />classical<br />  literature. Through SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM, she hoped to make her own<br />  favourite serial reawaken her personal beliefs and love of India, <br />the<br />  land that is 'bhakti naadu,' 'pannbu naadu,' 'maanam maryada <br />naadu.'  </p>
<p>  For this writer, having witnessed so many dance and music <br />performances<br />  over 50 years in Tamilnadu, the diasporic verve and old-world<br />  commitment of the dancers and actors were most touching. Through<br />  dance, music and theatre, these Singaporeans maintain contact with <br />the<br />  motherland they have all left behind many generations ago. </p>

<p>How beautiful!! I wish their dance troupe tours other<br />places also. It was a little strange how they wrote<br />about all key actors/roles but left out the hero<br />Narasimha Pallava! <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  is a great subject for a dance<br />drama, it is a pity nobody in India picked it up. I<br />know R S Manohar toyed with the india for a short<br />while and dropped it. </acronym></p>

        <p>How beautiful!! I wish their dance troupe tours other<br />places also. It was a little strange how they wrote<br />about all key actors/roles but left out the hero<br />Narasimha Pallava! <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  is a great subject for a dance<br />drama, it is a pity nobody in India picked it up. I<br />know R S Manohar toyed with the india for a short<br />while and dropped it. </acronym></p>

<p>  April 10, 2008 </p>
<p>  Mamallapuram, the ancient coastal city on the Bay of<br />  Bengal, is<br />  remembered today as the Pallava kings' gift to<br />  Tamilnadu. Mamallapuram<br />  was the dream of the visionary ruler Mahendra<br />  Pallavan who reigned in<br />  the 6th / 7th century AD. He was a ruler who was<br />  loved by his people<br />  and who worked tirelessly to maintain peace for his<br />  people for<br />  twenty-five years &#150; when suddenly war loomed at his<br />  gates! King<br />  Pulikesi of the neighboring Chalukya Empire, was<br />  almost at the<br />  Pallava kingdom's door step with an menacing army of<br />  16,000 elephants,<br />  12,000 cavalry and over a lakh of foot soliders. <br />  News came as the<br />  army had reached Tungabadra River! Facing certain<br />  defeat, King<br />  Mahendra Pallava performed a magnificent feat of<br />  camouflage, secrecy<br />  and political outmaneuvering to prolong peace for<br />  ten years, only to<br />  lose his life in battle trying to save his beloved<br />  capital city Kanchi<br />  &#150; the Pallava capital. </p>
<p>  This is the historical background that fuelled the<br />  brilliant mind of<br />  Kalki Krishnamurthy for his memorable story<br />  SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM. One<br />  of the most luminary writers of the 20th century,<br />  Kalki, as he was<br />  called with affection and awe, wove spellbinding<br />  narratives creating<br />  fictional characters located in actual historical<br />  times. 'Ponniyin<br />  Selvan' and 'Parthiban Kanavu' are memorable for the<br />  richness of their<br />  full blooded heroes and heroines located directly<br />  within actual<br />  historical events of South India. The stories,<br />  serialized in the<br />  immensely popular Tamil magazine Kalki, captured the<br />  imagination of an<br />  entire generation of readers who would wait avidly<br />  for the next issue<br />  of the magazine so that they could participate in<br />  the highs and lows<br />  of the wonderfully etched characters. A runaway hit<br />  for 12 years was<br />  his story of the dancing heroine of Kanchi,<br />  SIVAKMIYIN SAPATAM. The<br />  human life drama woven into the story was so<br />  believable and intense<br />  that millions were gripped with SIVAKAMI fever<br />  throughout these years,<br />  many actually learning to read and enjoy the Tamil<br />  language through<br />  the colourful saga of kings, war and power<br />  struggles. </p>
<p>  Across the Indian Ocean in nearby Singapore, the<br />  tale of Sivakami came<br />  to life in the majestic Victoria Theatre on<br />  September 14 and 15, 2007.<br />  Connecting the beloved tale to modern audiences, who<br />  barely have any<br />  name recall for Kalki or his protagonist Sivakami,<br />  choreographer Neila<br />  Sathyalingam presented her vision of the story that<br />  has fascinated her<br />  ever since she was a student in Kalakshetra in the<br />  60s... Through a<br />  sweeping 3 hour dance-theatre spectacle titled<br />  SIVKAMI, the dual<br />  language operatic presentation contained English<br />  dialogues and Tamil<br />  lyrics. </p>
<p>  A multiple award winning choreographer and cultural<br />  icon in Singapore<br />  for over 30 years, Neila Sathyalingam has a penchant<br />  for large brush<br />  strokes, having prepared dancers and floats for the<br />  annual Chingay<br />  Chinese New Year processions down Orchard Road. The<br />  65 actors and<br />  dancers filled Victoria Theatre's majestic<br />  proscenium stage with the<br />  throbbing spectacle of ambition, power, heroics and<br />  cunning. There<br />  were so many memorable scenes, the major one for<br />  this writer being the<br />  coming alive of the dance sculptures during the<br />  dream of sculptor<br />  Ayanar &#150; a moment that sent a 'frisson' through the<br />  audience who then<br />  burst into spontaneous applause! </p>
<p>  Reflecting Singaporean multicultural elements of<br />  Chinese / Malay /<br />  Thai / Tamil craft and dance traditions into a<br />  cohesive whole is<br />  difficult enough. One sees so much of work today in<br />  the name of<br />  'globalization' that is often a mere pastiche and an<br />  unconvincing<br />  mess. The intensity of Kalki's dialogue and the<br />  continuing horror of<br />  war and bloodshed created an authentic slice of<br />  history as well as<br />  painting a powerful contemporary metaphor about the<br />  futility of<br />  battle. Through 21 scenes broken up into 4 acts with<br />  an intermission,<br />  international audiences &#150; many of them Europeans &#150;   were introduced for<br />  the first time to a modern adaptation of this Tamil<br />  literary classic. </p>
<p>  Krishnakshi, the guest artiste from India, as<br />  Sivakami was simply<br />  superb. Through dance and dialogues, she held her<br />  own throughout the<br />  play. Dedicated as the epitome of beauty, grace and<br />  the very soul of<br />  the capital city Kanchi, Sivakami finds herself<br />  alone and abandoned<br />  through the vagaries of fate and her own pride. In<br />  her final days, she<br />  immerses herself in the service of Lord<br />  Ekambareswarar. Alone but not<br />  forgotten, an iconic image representing an era of<br />  grace that ended<br />  with an avoidable tragedy! Krishnakshi carried the<br />  character on her<br />  expressive shoulders with maturity and a magnificent<br />  stage presence. </p>
<p>  Selvanathan as Naganandhi was a convincing actor who<br />  conveyed his love<br />  for art and his affinity for scheming. In the<br />  pivotal role as the<br />  monk-brother of the marauding ruler Pulikesi, the<br />  struggle between his<br />  love of art and duty to his brother was convincingly<br />  portrayed.<br />  Noteworthy were his voice modulations during the<br />  furtive mourning of<br />  Sivakami &#150; the 'Kanchi Sundari,' who swoons after<br />  dancing on the<br />  streets all day to save her people while his<br />  brother, the heartless<br />  King Pulikesi threatens to torture the citizens of<br />  Kanchi, was<br />  brilliant. </p>
<p>  Sivakumar as Pulikesi, Emperor of the Chalukyas, who<br />  ravages Kanchi<br />  and razes this enchanted city to the ground, was<br />  played with mature<br />  measure and restraint. As the symbol of ego and<br />  ravenous pride,<br />  Sivakumar maintained this clear diction throughout<br />  the play. The<br />  moment when he holds the conquered Sivakami's face<br />  in his hands and<br />  asks sarcastically, "Is it your youth or your art<br />  that makes my<br />  brother Naganandi forget all his duties?" was<br />  performed with the<br />  coiled anger of a merciless ruler. </p>
<p>  Pallava King Mahendravarman was played by actor<br />  Mathialagan who was<br />  truly outstanding. An award winning actor on stage<br />  and TV, Mathialagan<br />  brought great dignity to his all important role. As<br />  the spy Vajra Bahu<br />  and as king of Kanchi, he held his own and<br />  manipulated his<br />  conversations with seasoned maturity. As the king he<br />  was regal, as the<br />  spy/strategist he conveyed the zeal and manipulative<br />  mind of an<br />  informer. His body language was convincing as was<br />  his dialogue<br />  delivery in English. A pivotal double role played to<br />  perfection that<br />  gave audiences a character who was so deeply<br />  invested in his kingdom</p>

<p>  Pallava King Mahendravarman was played by actor Mathialagan who was<br />  truly outstanding.

His body language was convincing as was his dialogue<br />  delivery in English. A pivotal double role played to perfection <br />that<br />  gave audiences a character who was so deeply invested in his <br />kingdom<br />  and his people. Through his portrayal, the rapt audience felt his<br />  palpable love for his capital city eulogized by poets in these<br />  memorable words... <br />  "Pushpeshi Jaati, Purusheshu Vishnu <br />  Naareeshu Rambha, Nagareshu Kanchi" </p>
<p>  The crowd scenes during battles were particularly well directed, <br />with<br />  entries and exits always neat and well rehearsed. This spoke of the<br />  choreographer's vast experience with a large cast and artistes from<br />  varied linguistic and cultural backgrounds.  </p>
<p>  The Ravindra Drama group of Singapore collaborated with Neila<br />  Sathyalingam's Apsara Arts dancers for this mammoth venture. The<br />  m鬡nge of dance and theatre, of spoken text and the sung/danced <br />lyric<br />  never outshone one another. This delicate balance was maintained<br />  throughout, heightened by the multicultural orchestral score <br />composed<br />  by L Krishnan and Aravinth Kumaraswamy, gripping dialogues by <br />Chennai<br />  Koothu-P-Pattarai's Kumaravel, and lavish costumes designed by <br />Neila<br />  Sathyalingam.  </p>
<p>  The two performances were graced by two special dignitaries. On<br />  opening night it was Mr. Tharman Shanmugharatnam, Minister for<br />  Education and Second Minister of Finance. On the second day, Mr. <br />Tommy<br />  Koh, Chairman National Heritage Board. Both men were lavish in <br />their<br />  praise of Neila Sathyalingam's unswerving zeal for the promotion of<br />  Indian dance and music in the rapidly changing face of Singapore. </p>
<p>  The spectacular scenography for SIVAKAMI spoke of the 2-year<br />  preparation Neila Sathyalingam and her able team had invested for <br />this<br />  production. For Neila, this is her swan song, or so she says. A<br />  student of Kalakshetra for more than 20 years during the most <br />creative<br />  time of its founder Rukmini Arundale, Neila imbibed "Atthai's"<br />  pan-Asian aesthetic while the legendary Ramayana series was being<br />  created and performed. Always open to new influences within the<br />  parameters of what is 'auchitya' or appropriate, all of Neila's<br />  earlier productions reflect her open mindedness and her love of new<br />  ideas and approaches to dance creation. In fact, she is a rare guru<br />  who always watches the works of younger dancers in any genre ?<br />  classical, traditional, modern and contemporary! SIVAKAMI's<br />  multicultural cast of Malays, Chinese and Indians also drew on each<br />  culture's specialization in martial arts, movement vocabularies and<br />  costume elements, which gave the show a truly Singaporean soul. </p>
<p>  Neila is acutely conscious of her Tamil roots and the rapidly<br />  declining readership among Singaporean and global youth for <br />classical<br />  literature. Through SIVAKAMIYIN SAPATAM, she hoped to make her own<br />  favourite serial reawaken her personal beliefs and love of India, <br />the<br />  land that is 'bhakti naadu,' 'pannbu naadu,' 'maanam maryada <br />naadu.'  </p>
<p>  For this writer, having witnessed so many dance and music <br />performances<br />  over 50 years in Tamilnadu, the diasporic verve and old-world<br />  commitment of the dancers and actors were most touching. Through<br />  dance, music and theatre, these Singaporeans maintain contact with <br />the<br />  motherland they have all left behind many generations ago. </p>
