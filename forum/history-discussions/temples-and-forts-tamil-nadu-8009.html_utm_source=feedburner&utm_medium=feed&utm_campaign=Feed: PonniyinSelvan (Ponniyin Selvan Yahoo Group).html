</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear All-</p>
<p>glory and?the brief northern domination of Pallavas the Tamil region has been adorned with temple architectures, some small, some really big, some rock cut that survived the wearing of times, wars and religious ferocity. There are 33,000 plus temples in the land of Tamils, big and small telling the tales of the great kings. But, why none of the forts of Cholas and Pandiyas built survived unlike the ones built by the regional kings in the state of Maharashtra, Karnanataka or Andhrapradesh?? The surviving forts in Vellore, Gingi, Dindigul, Mahal of Tirumalai Nayak's are all built by the cheiftains (Nayaks) or kings of Vijaya Nagara empire period post 15 th Century. </p>
<p>When the glorious days of Cholas ended after 12th Century, looks like the forts and 'aranmanais' Kalki describes in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  vanished with the invasions of Chalukya,?Vijaya Nagara and Maratha invasions. </p>
<p>Is this a right observation ? Could the enlightened members please clarify giving historic references ?</p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>TM Sunder</p>

<p>? <br />Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>Aditha Chozhan expanded Vijayalaya's kingdom around Thanjai towards Kanchi outskirts - touching Chingleput and around..</p>
<p>Therefore it should have connections with Aditha Chozhan only.</p>
<p>Will check for more details.</p>
<p>The details provided by you are very intersting.. thanks.</p>
<p>regards / sps</p>

<blockquote><p>  Visited this temple early today and here is what I came to know</p>
<p>  Adhambakkam was derived from Aadhani Chola - ever heard of him ?? (Aadhani pakkam --  Adhambakkam) .<br />  Kulothunga III allocated lands and renovated the temple.</p>
<p>  Interesting things are<br />  Lord Nandheeswarar facing Surya (inside prakaram)<br />  Bhariava inside prakaram <br />  Vishnu is on the back wall of Nandheeswarar<br />  Avudaiyamman was facing south</p>
<p>  So - another temple for the chola enthu's... </p>
<p>  PS: Temple is very ancient, though i could find people on the sides of the temple performing early morning rituals which made me think... <br />  ...aayiram irunthum... no peace of mind !</p>
<p>  More from the Net on the temple.</p>
<p>  This ancient temple is located in Chennai near St. Thomas Mount. The maindiety is Sri Nandheeswarar and Godess is Sri Aavudai Nayagi (Gomathi in Sanskrit).</p>
<p>  Legend says that, there lived a Rishi called 'Bringi Munivar' in the nearby hill and was performing penance worshipping Lord Shiva. As 'Bringi' Rishi was residing, the hill was called as 'Bringi Malai' which is today's 'Parangi Malai' or 'St. Thomas Mount'.</p>
<p>  Pleased by Bringi Rishi's worship, Lord Shiva gave dharshan to him in theform of Nandhi in this holy place and hence the God here is known as Nandheeswarar.</p>
<p>  During later days, a Chola king called "Aadhani Cholan" who was ruling this part of the land, constructed this temple. As this territory was part ofhis then kingdom, this place was known as "Aadhanippakkam" which turned tobe today's "Aadhambakkam" .</p>
<p>  Located very close to St. Thomas Mount Railway Station, this ancient, yetsmall and beautiful temple has a very holy ambience with ancient architecture and sculptures.</p>
<p>  There was a wall in between the Nandhi and the Sanctum Sanctorum which according to the Sastras is not good for the temple. Sri Paramacharya once visited this place and arranged to remove the obstructing wall between Nandhiand the main Diety.</p>
<p>  Other dieties present here are Pillaiyar, Sri Dhakshinamurthy, Maha Vishnu, Sri Durgai, Bairavar and Navagrahas.</p>
<p>  This temple attracts a huge crowd of devotees on Pradhosham days, as there are special poojas performed here promptly.</p>
<p>  The Bairavar here is also beleived to be more powerful and blessing for which many men and women pray to him for marriage or child birth.</p>
<p>  This temple, though located amidst the crowded city, gives that feeling of bliss and provides peace of mind to destress ourselves from today's stressful life.</p>
<p>  This temple will be worth visiting for devotees.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Some points to note:<br />  Thinai based god systems were the earliest in Tamil Land and can be considered the Native religion.<br />  This because the same form of worship can be identified in Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka(land- god system).</p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil proposes that Mayon(black one - agricultural deity- later mal- later vishnu) and Ceyon(Red one - hunter god- later sevvel -later Murukan- later Subrahmanya) were essentially the same god in early history. <br />  People lived in hills and were Hunters. Slowly the started agriculture and when permanent agriculture(till then they did agriculture where ever theymoved- they had a nomad life) was mastered..they moved down from Kurunji region to Mullai(forest) and gradually to Marutam(cultivated land) Regions for settlements. </p>
<p>  When this shift occurred the The proto Hunting god had become two gods namely Mayon the black one worshiped by Agriculture based people and Seyon the Red one worshiped by Hunters and Mountainous region people.</p>
<p>  When the full fledged cultivation and surplus food came in , kingdom started and the king assumed the biggest role in Marutam region.The king was worshiped as GOD. The god of Marutam region is KO - Ventan meaning King. Thiswas later IDENTIFIED AS INDRA since he was king of GODS and Indra was not the native god- he is also identified god like - Kottaravi being identifiedas Durga.</p>
<p>  Kottravai was major goddess. She was worshiped by the warrior clans , tribals and even thieves and robbers. She is goddess of victory. not much details are available to us. The literature we have is around 1-3rd century AD by that time the idetification of Korravai as Durga had taken place.</p>
<p>  Neytal settlement should have been a latter development and the god is varunan. Dr.Zvelebil proposes the god must be intially known as Katalon. There are refernces to teyvam of kadal and also the Malyalam folk deity of Seais called katal ammma.</p>
<p>  ----------</p>
<p>  Significance of King worship</p>
<p>  The King was considered the link between the supernatural and earthly deeds.<br />  It was believed because of him - all events of nature happened(like proper rain etc)</p>
<p>  Then enters all major religions into Tamil Nadu during the period of Ashoka. <br />  The Brahmins found it really tough to introduced their gods in the land which had totally different religious practice.<br />  This led to integration of two faiths...Esp. the Hindu religion trying toshape its Gods based on the Kings of the South -<br />  Some eg-<br />  Temple built like a fort and named Koil(ko- king , Il-House)<br />  Waking up god in the morning - giving him food (This practice of waking up kings and other rituals can be found in Puram)<br />  Taking the god in Temple car around the town( Ula of the king around the city to show his face to the citizens)<br />  --- More details of Kings worship in Hindu religion of South is explainedin details by Dr.George L Hart in his 'Poems of Ancient Tamil '--</p>
<p>  --- More details of Native Tamil deities are explained by Dr.Zvelebil in his 'Thiru Murugan'---</p>
<p>  --- Short Essay on pre history of Tamil Nadu and Murugan worship in Tamilnadu can be found in Fred Clothey's 'Many Faces of Murukan'--</p>
<p>  --Detailed essay on possible origin of Murugan worship from pre histroy to Sangam age , Based on Works of Dr.Zvelebil, Iravatham mahadeva and Fred Clothey can be found in one of my older blogs  <br />  <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/</a></p>

<p>    Bakthi movement :</p>
<p>    3rd BC or so :: BUDDISM :: Siddhartha - who relinquished Royalty upon<br />    seeing the myseries of downtrodden ENLIGHTENED and became Gauthama,<br />    the Buddha, in Patna @ PATALIPUTHRAM in Bihar.</p>
<p>    Essential teaching : Relinquish desire. Non Vedic. Non Violence.</p>
<p>    3rd BC or so :: JAINISM : Vardhamana MAHAVEERAR - Non Vedic - Non<br />    Violence - Swethmabaras (ambaram : clothing; Swetha : white)<br />    Digambaras (Digh : Directions - like East / West .. Non-clothing)</p>
<p>    PRIOR TO 3rd BC :: SAIVISM was professed in the form of KABALIKAM<br />    (Mandaiodu / skull wearers), Kalamughas, Pasupathas .. ( This will<br />    lead to very detailed discussion on the Religeous side.. Just ckech<br />    archieves under each item .. sure we have discussed earlier many of<br />    these). The SIVA identified for these worships was supposedly DANCING<br />    ON LIGHT OF THE PYRE OF DEAD-BODIES in CREMATION GROUNDS IN NIGHTS ..<br />    FEROCIOUS FORM.</p>
<p>    Around this time - say SANGAM AGE in Tamilnadu - KOTRAVAI was under<br />    worship.. Recall Thinais : Kurinji - Marudham - Mullai - Neydhal -<br />    Paalai :: Muruga - Kannan (Mayon) - Indiran - Siva - Kotravai were in<br />    worship.</p>
<p>    Siva was known as AALAMAR SELVAN ( Under the Banian Tree) !</p>
<p>    Now look at the Siva under the Banian Tree (South) and look at the<br />    Ferocious Siva dancing in Cremation Grounds (North) !</p>
<p>    There was fusion .. which took several centuries..</p>
<p>    A family was created ::</p>
<p>    Kotravai was fused with Kali and then in soft form became UMA, who in<br />    turn got wedded to Siva, their son became MURUGA (South) @ KARTHIK /<br />    KUMARA (North). Maayon became KRISHNA, then became as one of Avatars<br />    of VISHNU, who in turn became brother of Uma, Brother-in-law of Siva !</p>
<p>    With (Natural) God Surya in position SHAN MADHAS ( 6 Forms of FAITH /<br />    Religion) was systemised :<br />    SAIVAM - VAISHNAVAM - GOUMARAM (Kumaran / Muruga), SAAKTHAM (After<br />    SAKTHI), GANAPATHYAM (After Ganapathy) and SOURABAM (After Surya / Sun<br />    God) and accordingly SAPTHA (SEVEN) MATRIKAS - Goumari, Varahi,<br />    Indirani etc., were also in position..( Indiran became an outcast.)</p>
<p>    With these 6 systems of worship in position and Ferocious form of Siva<br />    worship diluted, PYRE DUST became Cow-dung burnt dust VIBOOTHI;     Kabalam - Uthiraksham; Flesh : Poosani; Blood : Kunkumam; Red flowers<br />    like Arali - Sembaruthi replaced certain organs and SLOWLY NON-<br />    VIOLENCE or KOLLAMAI (Not causing Death to Animals in Religeous<br />    rituals) was practised in these 6 systems of worship also.</p>
<p>    By this process, the SPECIALITY of Non-Violence preached in Buddism<br />    and Jainism started losing their significance and these two Faiths<br />    moved towards East / Far East away from their Mother land India ...</p>
<p>    This was the kind of India prevailed between 3rd BC and 6th AD ..</p>
<p>    Which lead to BAKTHI MOVEMENT in about 7th / 8th AD ..</p>
<p>    AZHWARs and NAAYANMARs are pearls selected from the ocean of this<br />    Bakthi movement ... brewing to Vaishnava - Siva differences later.</p>
<p>    We will conclude this with a FOCUS on the Fact that to spread a form<br />    of Faith, it has become necessary to make the King follow that Faith !</p>

<p>      Dear All-</p>
<p>diyan glory and?the brief northern domination of Pallavas the Tamil region has been adorned with temple architectures, some small, some really big, some rock cut that survived the wearing of times, wars and religious ferocity. There are 33,000 plus temples in the land of Tamils, big and small telling the tales of the great kings. But, why none of the forts of Cholas and Pandiyas built survived unlike the ones built by the regional kings in the state of Maharashtra, Karnanataka or Andhrapradesh?? The surviving forts in Vellore, Gingi, Dindigul, Mahal of Tirumalai Nayak's are all built by the cheiftains (Nayaks) or kings of Vijaya Nagara empire period post 15 th Century. </p>
<p>      When the glorious days of Cholas ended after 12th Century, looks likethe forts and 'aranmanais' Kalki describes in PS vanished with the invasions of Chalukya,?Vijaya Nagara and Maratha invasions. </p>
<p>      Is this a right observation ? Could the enlightened members please clarify giving historic references ?</p>
<p>      Thanks </p>

<p>        So - another temple for the chola enthu's... </p>
<p>        PS: Temple is very ancient, though i could find people on the sidesof the temple performing early morning rituals which made me think... <br />        ...aayiram irunthum... no peace of mind !</p>
<p>        More from the Net on the temple.</p>
<p>        This ancient temple is located in Chennai near St. Thomas Mount. The main diety is Sri Nandheeswarar and Godess is Sri Aavudai Nayagi (Gomathiin Sanskrit).</p>
<p>        Legend says that, there lived a Rishi called 'Bringi Munivar' in the nearby hill and was performing penance worshipping Lord Shiva. As 'Bringi' Rishi was residing, the hill was called as 'Bringi Malai' which is today's 'Parangi Malai' or 'St. Thomas Mount'.</p>
<p>        Pleased by Bringi Rishi's worship, Lord Shiva gave dharshan to him in the form of Nandhi in this holy place and hence the God here is known asNandheeswarar.</p>
<p>        During later days, a Chola king called "Aadhani Cholan" who was ruling this part of the land, constructed this temple. As this territory was part of his then kingdom, this place was known as "Aadhanippakkam" which turned to be today's "Aadhambakkam" .</p>
<p>        Located very close to St. Thomas Mount Railway Station, this ancient, yet small and beautiful temple has a very holy ambience with ancient architecture and sculptures.</p>
<p>        There was a wall in between the Nandhi and the Sanctum Sanctorum which according to the Sastras is not good for the temple. Sri Paramacharya once visited this place and arranged to remove the obstructing wall between Nandhi and the main Diety.</p>
<p>        Other dieties present here are Pillaiyar, Sri Dhakshinamurthy, MahaVishnu, Sri Durgai, Bairavar and Navagrahas.</p>
<p>        This temple attracts a huge crowd of devotees on Pradhosham days, as there are special poojas performed here promptly.</p>
<p>        The Bairavar here is also beleived to be more powerful and blessingfor which many men and women pray to him for marriage or child birth.</p>
<p>        This temple, though located amidst the crowded city, gives that feeling of bliss and provides peace of mind to destress ourselves from today'sstressful life.</p>
<p>        This temple will be worth visiting for devotees.</p></ravi_eds@></p></tmsunder@></p></sps10142004@></p></blockquote>

        <p>A STUDY OF EZHUVAR ANNAIYAR or SAPTHA MATRIKAS also interesting to recall...</p>
<p>We see in Pallava temples... </p>
<p>Mostly respective wives of Aadhi Sankara's Shanmathams...</p>
<p>Interestingly Pallavas are from atleast 550 AD Simhavishnu (chidambaram Hiranya varman around 450 AD it is stated).. and Sapthamatrikas have come intoworship prior to Aadhi Sankara.  </p>

<blockquote><p>  Some points to note:<br />  Thinai based god systems were the earliest in Tamil Land and can be considered the Native religion.<br />  This because the same form of worship can be identified in Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka(land- god system).</p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil proposes that Mayon(black one - agricultural deity- later mal- later vishnu) and Ceyon(Red one - hunter god- later sevvel -later Murukan- later Subrahmanya) were essentially the same god in early history. <br />  People lived in hills and were Hunters. Slowly the started agriculture and when permanent agriculture(till then they did agriculture where ever theymoved- they had a nomad life) was mastered..they moved down from Kurunji region to Mullai(forest) and gradually to Marutam(cultivated land) Regions for settlements. </p>
<p>  When this shift occurred the The proto Hunting god had become two gods namely Mayon the black one worshiped by Agriculture based people and Seyon the Red one worshiped by Hunters and Mountainous region people.</p>
<p>  When the full fledged cultivation and surplus food came in , kingdom started and the king assumed the biggest role in Marutam region.The king was worshiped as GOD. The god of Marutam region is KO - Ventan meaning King. Thiswas later IDENTIFIED AS INDRA since he was king of GODS and Indra was not the native god- he is also identified god like - Kottaravi being identifiedas Durga.</p>
<p>  Kottravai was major goddess. She was worshiped by the warrior clans , tribals and even thieves and robbers. She is goddess of victory. not much details are available to us. The literature we have is around 1-3rd century AD by that time the idetification of Korravai as Durga had taken place.</p>
<p>  Neytal settlement should have been a latter development and the god is varunan. Dr.Zvelebil proposes the god must be intially known as Katalon. There are refernces to teyvam of kadal and also the Malyalam folk deity of Seais called katal ammma.</p>
<p>  ----------</p>
<p>  Significance of King worship</p>
<p>  The King was considered the link between the supernatural and earthly deeds.<br />  It was believed because of him - all events of nature happened(like proper rain etc)</p>
<p>  Then enters all major religions into Tamil Nadu during the period of Ashoka. <br />  The Brahmins found it really tough to introduced their gods in the land which had totally different religious practice.<br />  This led to integration of two faiths...Esp. the Hindu religion trying toshape its Gods based on the Kings of the South -<br />  Some eg-<br />  Temple built like a fort and named Koil(ko- king , Il-House)<br />  Waking up god in the morning - giving him food (This practice of waking up kings and other rituals can be found in Puram)<br />  Taking the god in Temple car around the town( Ula of the king around the city to show his face to the citizens)<br />  --- More details of Kings worship in Hindu religion of South is explainedin details by Dr.George L Hart in his 'Poems of Ancient Tamil '--</p>
<p>  --- More details of Native Tamil deities are explained by Dr.Zvelebil in his 'Thiru Murugan'---</p>
<p>  --- Short Essay on pre history of Tamil Nadu and Murugan worship in Tamilnadu can be found in Fred Clothey's 'Many Faces of Murukan'--</p>
<p>  --Detailed essay on possible origin of Murugan worship from pre histroy to Sangam age , Based on Works of Dr.Zvelebil, Iravatham mahadeva and Fred Clothey can be found in one of my older blogs  <br />  <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/</a></p>

<p>    sps wrote on 31.1.2008 ::</p>
<p>    Bakthi movement :</p>
<p>    3rd BC or so :: BUDDISM :: Siddhartha - who relinquished Royalty upon<br />    seeing the myseries of downtrodden ENLIGHTENED and became Gauthama,<br />    the Buddha, in Patna @ PATALIPUTHRAM in Bihar.</p>
<p>    Essential teaching : Relinquish desire. Non Vedic. Non Violence.</p>
<p>    3rd BC or so :: JAINISM : Vardhamana MAHAVEERAR - Non Vedic - Non<br />    Violence - Swethmabaras (ambaram : clothing; Swetha : white)<br />    Digambaras (Digh : Directions - like East / West .. Non-clothing)</p>
<p>    PRIOR TO 3rd BC :: SAIVISM was professed in the form of KABALIKAM<br />    (Mandaiodu / skull wearers), Kalamughas, Pasupathas .. ( This will<br />    lead to very detailed discussion on the Religeous side.. Just ckech<br />    archieves under each item .. sure we have discussed earlier many of<br />    these). The SIVA identified for these worships was supposedly DANCING<br />    ON LIGHT OF THE PYRE OF DEAD-BODIES in CREMATION GROUNDS IN NIGHTS ..<br />    FEROCIOUS FORM.</p>
<p>    Around this time - say SANGAM AGE in Tamilnadu - KOTRAVAI was under<br />    worship.. Recall Thinais : Kurinji - Marudham - Mullai - Neydhal -<br />    Paalai :: Muruga - Kannan (Mayon) - Indiran - Siva - Kotravai were in<br />    worship.</p>
<p>    Siva was known as AALAMAR SELVAN ( Under the Banian Tree) !</p>
<p>    Now look at the Siva under the Banian Tree (South) and look at the<br />    Ferocious Siva dancing in Cremation Grounds (North) !</p>
<p>    There was fusion .. which took several centuries..</p>
<p>    A family was created ::</p>
<p>    Kotravai was fused with Kali and then in soft form became UMA, who in<br />    turn got wedded to Siva, their son became MURUGA (South) @ KARTHIK /<br />    KUMARA (North). Maayon became KRISHNA, then became as one of Avatars<br />    of VISHNU, who in turn became brother of Uma, Brother-in-law of Siva !</p>
<p>    With (Natural) God Surya in position SHAN MADHAS ( 6 Forms of FAITH /<br />    Religion) was systemised :<br />    SAIVAM - VAISHNAVAM - GOUMARAM (Kumaran / Muruga), SAAKTHAM (After<br />    SAKTHI), GANAPATHYAM (After Ganapathy) and SOURABAM (After Surya / Sun<br />    God) and accordingly SAPTHA (SEVEN) MATRIKAS - Goumari, Varahi,<br />    Indirani etc., were also in position..( Indiran became an outcast.)</p>
<p>    With these 6 systems of worship in position and Ferocious form of Siva<br />    worship diluted, PYRE DUST became Cow-dung burnt dust VIBOOTHI;     Kabalam - Uthiraksham; Flesh : Poosani; Blood : Kunkumam; Red flowers<br />    like Arali - Sembaruthi replaced certain organs and SLOWLY NON-<br />    VIOLENCE or KOLLAMAI (Not causing Death to Animals in Religeous<br />    rituals) was practised in these 6 systems of worship also.</p>
<p>    By this process, the SPECIALITY of Non-Violence preached in Buddism<br />    and Jainism started losing their significance and these two Faiths<br />    moved towards East / Far East away from their Mother land India ...</p>
<p>    This was the kind of India prevailed between 3rd BC and 6th AD ..</p>
<p>    Which lead to BAKTHI MOVEMENT in about 7th / 8th AD ..</p>
<p>    AZHWARs and NAAYANMARs are pearls selected from the ocean of this<br />    Bakthi movement ... brewing to Vaishnava - Siva differences later.</p>
<p>    We will conclude this with a FOCUS on the Fact that to spread a form<br />    of Faith, it has become necessary to make the King follow that Faith !</p>

<p>      Dear All-</p>
<p>diyan glory and?the brief northern domination of Pallavas the Tamil region has been adorned with temple architectures, some small, some really big, some rock cut that survived the wearing of times, wars and religious ferocity. There are 33,000 plus temples in the land of Tamils, big and small telling the tales of the great kings. But, why none of the forts of Cholas and Pandiyas built survived unlike the ones built by the regional kings in the state of Maharashtra, Karnanataka or Andhrapradesh?? The surviving forts in Vellore, Gingi, Dindigul, Mahal of Tirumalai Nayak's are all built by the cheiftains (Nayaks) or kings of Vijaya Nagara empire period post 15 th Century. </p>
<p>      When the glorious days of Cholas ended after 12th Century, looks likethe forts and 'aranmanais' Kalki describes in PS vanished with the invasions of Chalukya,?Vijaya Nagara and Maratha invasions. </p>
<p>      Is this a right observation ? Could the enlightened members please clarify giving historic references ?</p>
<p>      Thanks </p>

<p>      Therefore it should have connections with Aditha Chozhan only.</p>

<p>        Adhambakkam was derived from Aadhani Chola - ever heard of him ?? (Aadhani pakkam --  Adhambakkam) .<br />        Kulothunga III allocated lands and renovated the temple.</p>
<p>        Interesting things are<br />        Lord Nandheeswarar facing Surya (inside prakaram)<br />        Bhariava inside prakaram <br />        Vishnu is on the back wall of Nandheeswarar<br />        Avudaiyamman was facing south</p>
<p>        So - another temple for the chola enthu's... </p>
<p>        PS: Temple is very ancient, though i could find people on the sidesof the temple performing early morning rituals which made me think... <br />        ...aayiram irunthum... no peace of mind !</p>
<p>        More from the Net on the temple.</p>
<p>        This ancient temple is located in Chennai near St. Thomas Mount. The main diety is Sri Nandheeswarar and Godess is Sri Aavudai Nayagi (Gomathiin Sanskrit).</p>
<p>        Legend says that, there lived a Rishi called 'Bringi Munivar' in the nearby hill and was performing penance worshipping Lord Shiva. As 'Bringi' Rishi was residing, the hill was called as 'Bringi Malai' which is today's 'Parangi Malai' or 'St. Thomas Mount'.</p>
<p>        Pleased by Bringi Rishi's worship, Lord Shiva gave dharshan to him in the form of Nandhi in this holy place and hence the God here is known asNandheeswarar.</p>
<p>        During later days, a Chola king called "Aadhani Cholan" who was ruling this part of the land, constructed this temple. As this territory was part of his then kingdom, this place was known as "Aadhanippakkam" which turned to be today's "Aadhambakkam" .</p>
<p>        Located very close to St. Thomas Mount Railway Station, this ancient, yet small and beautiful temple has a very holy ambience with ancient architecture and sculptures.</p>
<p>        There was a wall in between the Nandhi and the Sanctum Sanctorum which according to the Sastras is not good for the temple. Sri Paramacharya once visited this place and arranged to remove the obstructing wall between Nandhi and the main Diety.</p>
<p>        Other dieties present here are Pillaiyar, Sri Dhakshinamurthy, MahaVishnu, Sri Durgai, Bairavar and Navagrahas.</p>
<p>        This temple attracts a huge crowd of devotees on Pradhosham days, as there are special poojas performed here promptly.</p>
<p>        The Bairavar here is also beleived to be more powerful and blessingfor which many men and women pray to him for marriage or child birth.</p>
<p>        This temple, though located amidst the crowded city, gives that feeling of bliss and provides peace of mind to destress ourselves from today'sstressful life.</p>
<p>        This temple will be worth visiting for devotees.</p></ravi_eds@></p></tmsunder@></p></sps10142004@></p></blockquote>

<p>        Interesting things are<br />        Lord Nandheeswarar facing Surya (inside prakaram)<br />        Bhariava inside prakaram <br />        Vishnu is on the back wall of Nandheeswarar<br />        Avudaiyamman was facing south</p>
<p>        So - another temple for the chola enthu's... </p>
<p>        PS: Temple is very ancient, though i could find people on the sidesof the temple performing early morning rituals which made me think... <br />        ...aayiram irunthum... no peace of mind !</p>
<p>        More from the Net on the temple.</p>
<p>        This ancient temple is located in Chennai near St. Thomas Mount. The main diety is Sri Nandheeswarar and Godess is Sri Aavudai Nayagi (Gomathiin Sanskrit).</p>
<p>        Legend says that, there lived a Rishi called 'Bringi Munivar' in the nearby hill and was performing penance worshipping Lord Shiva. As 'Bringi' Rishi was residing, the hill was called as 'Bringi Malai' which is today's 'Parangi Malai' or 'St. Thomas Mount'.</p>
<p>        Pleased by Bringi Rishi's worship, Lord Shiva gave dharshan to him in the form of Nandhi in this holy place and hence the God here is known asNandheeswarar.</p>
<p>        During later days, a Chola king called "Aadhani Cholan" who was ruling this part of the land, constructed this temple. As this territory was part of his then kingdom, this place was known as "Aadhanippakkam" which turned to be today's "Aadhambakkam" .</p>
<p>        Located very close to St. Thomas Mount Railway Station, this ancient, yet small and beautiful temple has a very holy ambience with ancient architecture and sculptures.</p>
<p>        There was a wall in between the Nandhi and the Sanctum Sanctorum which according to the Sastras is not good for the temple. Sri Paramacharya once visited this place and arranged to remove the obstructing wall between Nandhi and the main Diety.</p>
<p>        Other dieties present here are Pillaiyar, Sri Dhakshinamurthy, MahaVishnu, Sri Durgai, Bairavar and Navagrahas.</p>
<p>        This temple attracts a huge crowd of devotees on Pradhosham days, as there are special poojas performed here promptly.</p>
<p>        The Bairavar here is also beleived to be more powerful and blessingfor which many men and women pray to him for marriage or child birth.</p>
<p>        This temple, though located amidst the crowded city, gives that feeling of bliss and provides peace of mind to destress ourselves from today'sstressful life.</p>
<p>        This temple will be worth visiting for devotees.</p></ravi_eds@></p></tmsunder@></p></sps10142004@></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>  Some points to note:<br />  Thinai based god systems were the earliest in Tamil Land and can be<br />  considered the Native religion.<br />  This because the same form of worship can be identified in Sinhalese people<br />  of Sri Lanka(land- god system).</p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil proposes that Mayon(black one - agricultural deity- later mal-<br />  later vishnu) and Ceyon(Red one - hunter god- later sevvel -later Murukan-<br />  later Subrahmanya) were essentially the same god in early history.<br />  People lived in hills and were Hunters. Slowly the started agriculture and<br />  when permanent agriculture(till then they did agriculture where ever they<br />  moved- they had a nomad life) was mastered..they moved down from Kurunji<br />  region to Mullai(forest) and gradually to Marutam(cultivated land) Regions<br />  for settlements.</p>
<p>  When this shift occurred the The proto Hunting god had become two gods<br />  namely Mayon the black one worshiped by Agriculture based people and Seyon<br />  the Red one worshiped by Hunters and Mountainous region people.</p>
<p>  When the full fledged cultivation and surplus food came in , kingdom started<br />  and the king assumed the biggest role in Marutam region.The king was<br />  worshiped as GOD. The god of Marutam region is KO - Ventan meaning King.<br />  This was later IDENTIFIED AS INDRA since he was king of GODS and Indra was<br />  not the native god- he is also identified god like - Kottaravi being<br />  identified as Durga.</p>
<p>  Kottravai was major goddess. She was worshiped by the warrior clans ,<br />  tribals and even thieves and robbers. She is goddess of victory. not much<br />  details are available to us. The literature we have is around 1-3rd century<br />  AD by that time the idetification of Korravai as Durga had taken place.</p>
<p>  Neytal settlement should have been a latter development and the god is<br />  varunan. Dr.Zvelebil proposes the god must be intially known as Katalon.<br />  There are refernces to teyvam of kadal and also the Malyalam folk deity of<br />  Sea is called katal ammma.</p>
<p>  ----------</p>
<p>  Significance of King worship</p>
<p>  The King was considered the link between the supernatural and earthly deeds.<br />  It was believed because of him - all events of nature happened(like proper<br />  rain etc)</p>
<p>  Then enters all major religions into Tamil Nadu during the period of Ashoka.<br />  The Brahmins found it really tough to introduced their gods in the land<br />  which had totally different religious practice.<br />  This led to integration of two faiths...Esp. the Hindu religion trying to<br />  shape its Gods based on the Kings of the South -<br />  Some eg-<br />  Temple built like a fort and named Koil(ko- king , Il-House)<br />  Waking up god in the morning - giving him food (This practice of waking up<br />  kings and other rituals can be found in Puram)<br />  Taking the god in Temple car around the town( Ula of the king around the<br />  city to show his face to the citizens)<br />  --- More details of Kings worship in Hindu religion of South is explainedin<br />  details by Dr.George L Hart in his 'Poems of Ancient Tamil '--</p>
<p>  --- More details of Native Tamil deities are explained by Dr.Zvelebil in his<br />  'Thiru Murugan'---</p>
<p>  --- Short Essay on pre history of Tamil Nadu and Murugan worship in Tamil<br />  nadu can be found in Fred Clothey's 'Many Faces of Murukan'--</p>
<p>  --Detailed essay on possible origin of Murugan worship from pre histroy to<br />  Sangam age , Based on Works of Dr.Zvelebil, Iravatham mahadeva and Fred<br />  Clothey can be found in one of my older blogs<br />  <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/</a></p>

<p>   sps wrote on 31.1.2008 ::</p>
<p>   Bakthi movement :</p>
<p>   3rd BC or so :: BUDDISM :: Siddhartha - who relinquished Royalty upon<br />   seeing the myseries of downtrodden ENLIGHTENED and became Gauthama,<br />   the Buddha, in Patna @ PATALIPUTHRAM in Bihar.</p>
<p>   Essential teaching : Relinquish desire. Non Vedic. Non Violence.</p>
<p>   3rd BC or so :: JAINISM : Vardhamana MAHAVEERAR - Non Vedic - Non<br />   Violence - Swethmabaras (ambaram : clothing; Swetha : white)<br />   Digambaras (Digh : Directions - like East / West .. Non-clothing)</p>
<p>   PRIOR TO 3rd BC :: SAIVISM was professed in the form of KABALIKAM<br />   (Mandaiodu / skull wearers), Kalamughas, Pasupathas .. ( This will<br />   lead to very detailed discussion on the Religeous side.. Just ckech<br />   archieves under each item .. sure we have discussed earlier many of<br />   these). The SIVA identified for these worships was supposedly DANCING<br />   ON LIGHT OF THE PYRE OF DEAD-BODIES in CREMATION GROUNDS IN NIGHTS ..<br />   FEROCIOUS FORM.</p>
<p>   Around this time - say SANGAM AGE in Tamilnadu - KOTRAVAI was under<br />   worship.. Recall Thinais : Kurinji - Marudham - Mullai - Neydhal -<br />   Paalai :: Muruga - Kannan (Mayon) - Indiran - Siva - Kotravai were in<br />   worship.</p>
<p>   Siva was known as AALAMAR SELVAN ( Under the Banian Tree) !</p>
<p>   Now look at the Siva under the Banian Tree (South) and look at the<br />   Ferocious Siva dancing in Cremation Grounds (North) !</p>
<p>   There was fusion .. which took several centuries..</p>
<p>   A family was created ::</p>
<p>   Kotravai was fused with Kali and then in soft form became UMA, who in<br />   turn got wedded to Siva, their son became MURUGA (South) @ KARTHIK /<br />   KUMARA (North). Maayon became KRISHNA, then became as one of Avatars<br />   of VISHNU, who in turn became brother of Uma, Brother-in-law of Siva !</p>
<p>   With (Natural) God Surya in position SHAN MADHAS ( 6 Forms of FAITH /<br />   Religion) was systemised :<br />   SAIVAM - VAISHNAVAM - GOUMARAM (Kumaran / Muruga), SAAKTHAM (After<br />   SAKTHI), GANAPATHYAM (After Ganapathy) and SOURABAM (After Surya / Sun<br />   God) and accordingly SAPTHA (SEVEN) MATRIKAS - Goumari, Varahi,<br />   Indirani etc., were also in position..( Indiran became an outcast.)</p>
<p>   With these 6 systems of worship in position and Ferocious form of Siva<br />   worship diluted, PYRE DUST became Cow-dung burnt dust VIBOOTHI;    Kabalam - Uthiraksham; Flesh : Poosani; Blood : Kunkumam; Red flowers<br />   like Arali - Sembaruthi replaced certain organs and SLOWLY NON-<br />   VIOLENCE or KOLLAMAI (Not causing Death to Animals in Religeous<br />   rituals) was practised in these 6 systems of worship also.</p>
<p>   By this process, the SPECIALITY of Non-Violence preached in Buddism<br />   and Jainism started losing their significance and these two Faiths<br />   moved towards East / Far East away from their Mother land India ...</p>
<p>   This was the kind of India prevailed between 3rd BC and 6th AD ..</p>
<p>   Which lead to BAKTHI MOVEMENT in about 7th / 8th AD ..</p>
<p>   AZHWARs and NAAYANMARs are pearls selected from the ocean of this<br />   Bakthi movement ... brewing to Vaishnava - Siva differences later.</p>
<p>   We will conclude this with a FOCUS on the Fact that to spread a form<br />   of Faith, it has become necessary to make the King follow that Faith !</p>

<p>     Dear All-</p>
<p>     Pandiyan glory and?the brief northern domination of Pallavas the Tamil<br />     region has been adorned with temple architectures, some small, some really<br />     big, some rock cut that survived the wearing of times, wars and religious<br />     ferocity. There are 33,000 plus temples in the land of Tamils, big andsmall<br />     telling the tales of the great kings. But, why none of the forts of Cholas<br />     and Pandiyas built survived unlike the ones built by the regional kings in<br />     the state of Maharashtra, Karnanataka or Andhrapradesh?? The surviving forts<br />     in Vellore, Gingi, Dindigul, Mahal of Tirumalai Nayak's are all built by the<br />     cheiftains (Nayaks) or kings of Vijaya Nagara empire period post 15 th<br />     Century.</p>
<p>     When the glorious days of Cholas ended after 12th Century, looks like<br />     the forts and 'aranmanais' Kalki describes in PS vanished with the invasions<br />     of Chalukya,?Vijaya Nagara and Maratha invasions.</p>
<p>     Is this a right observation ? Could the enlightened members please<br />     clarify giving historic references ?</p>
<p>     Thanks</p>

<p>     Aditha Chozhan expanded Vijayalaya's kingdom around Thanjai towards<br />     Kanchi outskirts - touching Chingleput and around..</p>
<p>     Therefore it should have connections with Aditha Chozhan only.</p>

<p>     Aditha Chozhan expanded Vijayalaya's kingdom around Thanjai towards<br />     Kanchi outskirts - touching Chingleput and around..</p>
<p>     Therefore it should have connections with Aditha Chozhan only.</p>

<p>     The details provided by you are very intersting.. thanks.</p>

<p>       Visited this temple early today and here is what I came to know</p>
<p>       Adhambakkam was derived from Aadhani Chola - ever heard of him ??<br />       (Aadhani pakkam --  Adhambakkam) .<br />       Kulothunga III allocated lands and renovated the temple.</p>
<p>       Interesting things are<br />       Lord Nandheeswarar facing Surya (inside prakaram)<br />       Bhariava inside prakaram<br />       Vishnu is on the back wall of Nandheeswarar<br />       Avudaiyamman was facing south</p>
<p>       So - another temple for the chola enthu's...</p>
<p>       PS: Temple is very ancient, though i could find people on the sides of<br />       the temple performing early morning rituals which made me think...<br />       ...aayiram irunthum... no peace of mind !</p>
<p>       More from the Net on the temple.</p>
<p>       This ancient temple is located in Chennai near St. Thomas Mount. The<br />       main diety is Sri Nandheeswarar and Godess is Sri Aavudai Nayagi (Gomathi in<br />       Sanskrit).</p>
<p>       Legend says that, there lived a Rishi called 'Bringi Munivar' in the<br />       nearby hill and was performing penance worshipping Lord Shiva. As 'Bringi'<br />       Rishi was residing, the hill was called as 'Bringi Malai' which is today's<br />       'Parangi Malai' or 'St. Thomas Mount'.</p>
<p>       Pleased by Bringi Rishi's worship, Lord Shiva gave dharshan to him in<br />       the form of Nandhi in this holy place and hence the God here is known as<br />       Nandheeswarar.</p>
<p>       During later days, a Chola king called "Aadhani Cholan" who was ruling<br />       this part of the land, constructed this temple. As this territory was part<br />       of his then kingdom, this place was known as "Aadhanippakkam" which turned<br />       to be today's "Aadhambakkam" .</p>
<p>       Located very close to St. Thomas Mount Railway Station, this ancient,<br />       yet small and beautiful temple has a very holy ambience with ancient<br />       architecture and sculptures.</p>
<p>       There was a wall in between the Nandhi and the Sanctum Sanctorum which<br />       according to the Sastras is not good for the temple. Sri Paramacharya once<br />       visited this place and arranged to remove the obstructing wall between<br />       Nandhi and the main Diety.</p>
<p>       Other dieties present here are Pillaiyar, Sri Dhakshinamurthy, Maha<br />       Vishnu, Sri Durgai, Bairavar and Navagrahas.</p>
<p>       This temple attracts a huge crowd of devotees on Pradhosham days, as<br />       there are special poojas performed here promptly.</p>
<p>       The Bairavar here is also beleived to be more powerful and blessing<br />       for which many men and women pray to him for marriage or child birth.</p>
<p>       This temple, though located amidst the crowded city, gives that<br />       feeling of bliss and provides peace of mind to destress ourselves from<br />       today's stressful life.</p>
<p>       This temple will be worth visiting for devotees.</p>

        <p>Some points to note:<br />Thinai based god systems were the earliest in Tamil Land and can be considered the Native religion.<br />This because the same form of worship can be identified in Sinhalese peopleof Sri Lanka(land- god system).</p>
<p>Dr.Zvelebil proposes that Mayon(black one - agricultural deity- later mal- later vishnu) and Ceyon(Red one - hunter god- later sevvel -later Murukan -later Subrahmanya) were essentially the same god in early history. <br />People lived in hills and were Hunters. Slowly the started agriculture and when permanent agriculture(till then they did agriculture where ever they moved- they had a nomad life) was mastered..they moved down from Kurunji region to Mullai(forest) and gradually to Marutam(cultivated land) Regions forsettlements. </p>
<p>When this shift occurred the The proto Hunting god had become two gods namely Mayon the black one worshiped by Agriculture based people and Seyon the Red one worshiped by Hunters and Mountainous region people.</p>
<p>When the full fledged cultivation and surplus food came in , kingdom started and the king assumed the biggest role in Marutam region.The king was worshiped as GOD. The god of Marutam region is KO - Ventan meaning King. This was later IDENTIFIED AS INDRA since he was king of GODS and Indra was not the native god- he is also identified god like - Kottaravi being identified as Durga.</p>
<p>Kottravai was major goddess. She was worshiped by the warrior clans , tribals and even thieves and robbers. She is goddess of victory. not much details are available to us. The literature we have is around 1-3rd century AD bythat time the idetification of Korravai as Durga had taken place.</p>
<p>Neytal settlement should have been a latter development and the god is varunan. Dr.Zvelebil proposes the god must be intially known as Katalon. Thereare refernces to teyvam of kadal and also the Malyalam folk deity of Sea is called katal ammma.</p>

<p>      So - another temple for the chola enthu's... </p>
<p>      PS: Temple is very ancient, though i could find people on the sides of the temple performing early morning rituals which made me think... <br />      ...aayiram irunthum... no peace of mind !</p>
<p>      More from the Net on the temple.</p>
<p>      This ancient temple is located in Chennai near St. Thomas Mount. The main diety is Sri Nandheeswarar and Godess is Sri Aavudai Nayagi (Gomathi in Sanskrit).</p>
<p>      Legend says that, there lived a Rishi called 'Bringi Munivar' in the nearby hill and was performing penance worshipping Lord Shiva. As 'Bringi' Rishi was residing, the hill was called as 'Bringi Malai' which is today's 'Parangi Malai' or 'St. Thomas Mount'.</p>
<p>      Pleased by Bringi Rishi's worship, Lord Shiva gave dharshan to him inthe form of Nandhi in this holy place and hence the God here is known as Nandheeswarar.</p>
<p>      During later days, a Chola king called "Aadhani Cholan" who was ruling this part of the land, constructed this temple. As this territory was part of his then kingdom, this place was known as "Aadhanippakkam" which turned to be today's "Aadhambakkam" .</p>
<p>      Located very close to St. Thomas Mount Railway Station, this ancient,yet small and beautiful temple has a very holy ambience with ancient architecture and sculptures.</p>
<p>      There was a wall in between the Nandhi and the Sanctum Sanctorum which according to the Sastras is not good for the temple. Sri Paramacharya once visited this place and arranged to remove the obstructing wall between Nandhi and the main Diety.</p>
<p>      Other dieties present here are Pillaiyar, Sri Dhakshinamurthy, Maha Vishnu, Sri Durgai, Bairavar and Navagrahas.</p>
<p>      This temple attracts a huge crowd of devotees on Pradhosham days, as there are special poojas performed here promptly.</p>
<p>      The Bairavar here is also beleived to be more powerful and blessing for which many men and women pray to him for marriage or child birth.</p>
<p>      This temple, though located amidst the crowded city, gives that feeling of bliss and provides peace of mind to destress ourselves from today's stressful life.</p>
<p>      This temple will be worth visiting for devotees.</p>

          Temples and Forts of Tamil Nadu        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Some points to note:<br />Thinai based god systems were the earliest in Tamil Land and can be considered the Native religion.<br />This because the same form of worship can be identified in Sinhalese peopleof Sri Lanka(land- god system).</p>
<p>Dr.Zvelebil proposes that Mayon(black one - agricultural deity- later mal- later vishnu) and Ceyon(Red one - hunter god- later sevvel -later Murukan -later Subrahmanya) were essentially the same god in early history. <br />People lived in hills and were Hunters. Slowly the started agriculture and when permanent agriculture(till then they did agriculture where ever they moved- they had a nomad life) was mastered..they moved down from Kurunji region to Mullai(forest) and gradually to Marutam(cultivated land) Regions forsettlements. </p>
<p>When this shift occurred the The proto Hunting god had become two gods namely Mayon the black one worshiped by Agriculture based people and Seyon the Red one worshiped by Hunters and Mountainous region people.</p>
<p>When the full fledged cultivation and surplus food came in , kingdom started and the king assumed the biggest role in Marutam region.The king was worshiped as GOD. The god of Marutam region is KO - Ventan meaning King. This was later IDENTIFIED AS INDRA since he was king of GODS and Indra was not the native god- he is also identified god like - Kottaravi being identified as Durga.</p>
<p>Kottravai was major goddess. She was worshiped by the warrior clans , tribals and even thieves and robbers. She is goddess of victory. not much details are available to us. The literature we have is around 1-3rd century AD bythat time the idetification of Korravai as Durga had taken place.</p>
<p>Neytal settlement should have been a latter development and the god is varunan. Dr.Zvelebil proposes the god must be intially known as Katalon. Thereare refernces to teyvam of kadal and also the Malyalam folk deity of Sea is called katal ammma.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Significance of King worship</p>
<p>The King was considered the link between the supernatural and earthly deeds.<br />It was believed because of him - all events of nature happened(like proper rain etc)</p>
<p>Then enters all major religions into Tamil Nadu during the period of Ashoka. <br />The Brahmins found it really tough to introduced their gods in the land which had totally different religious practice.<br />This led to integration of two faiths...Esp. the Hindu religion trying to shape its Gods based on the Kings of the South -<br />Some eg-<br />Temple built like a fort and named Koil(ko- king , Il-House)<br />Waking up god in the morning - giving him food (This practice of waking up kings and other rituals can be found in Puram)<br />Taking the god in Temple car around the town( Ula of the king around the city to show his face to the citizens)<br />--- More details of Kings worship in Hindu religion of South is explained in details by Dr.George L Hart in his 'Poems of Ancient Tamil '--</p>
<p>--- More details of Native Tamil deities are explained by Dr.Zvelebil in his 'Thiru Murugan'---</p>
<p>--- Short Essay on pre history of Tamil Nadu and Murugan worship in Tamil nadu can be found in Fred Clothey's 'Many Faces of Murukan'--</p>
<p>--Detailed essay on possible origin of Murugan worship from pre histroy to Sangam age , Based on Works of Dr.Zvelebil, Iravatham mahadeva and Fred Clothey can be found in one of my older blogs  <br /><a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/murugan1-2/</a></p>

<p>  PRIOR TO 3rd BC :: SAIVISM was professed in the form of KABALIKAM<br />  (Mandaiodu / skull wearers), Kalamughas, Pasupathas .. ( This will<br />  lead to very detailed discussion on the Religeous side.. Just ckech<br />  archieves under each item .. sure we have discussed earlier many of<br />  these). The SIVA identified for these worships was supposedly DANCING<br />  ON LIGHT OF THE PYRE OF DEAD-BODIES in CREMATION GROUNDS IN NIGHTS ..<br />  FEROCIOUS FORM.</p>
<p>  Around this time - say SANGAM AGE in Tamilnadu - KOTRAVAI was under<br />  worship.. Recall Thinais : Kurinji - Marudham - Mullai - Neydhal -<br />  Paalai :: Muruga - Kannan (Mayon) - Indiran - Siva - Kotravai were in<br />  worship.</p>
<p>  Siva was known as AALAMAR SELVAN ( Under the Banian Tree) !</p>
<p>  Now look at the Siva under the Banian Tree (South) and look at the<br />  Ferocious Siva dancing in Cremation Grounds (North) !</p>
<p>  There was fusion .. which took several centuries..</p>
<p>  A family was created ::</p>
<p>  Kotravai was fused with Kali and then in soft form became UMA, who in<br />  turn got wedded to Siva, their son became MURUGA (South) @ KARTHIK /<br />  KUMARA (North). Maayon became KRISHNA, then became as one of Avatars<br />  of VISHNU, who in turn became brother of Uma, Brother-in-law of Siva !</p>
<p>  With (Natural) God Surya in position SHAN MADHAS ( 6 Forms of FAITH /<br />  Religion) was systemised :<br />  SAIVAM - VAISHNAVAM - GOUMARAM (Kumaran / Muruga), SAAKTHAM (After<br />  SAKTHI), GANAPATHYAM (After Ganapathy) and SOURABAM (After Surya / Sun<br />  God) and accordingly SAPTHA (SEVEN) MATRIKAS - Goumari, Varahi,<br />  Indirani etc., were also in position..( Indiran became an outcast.)</p>
<p>  With these 6 systems of worship in position and Ferocious form of Siva<br />  worship diluted, PYRE DUST became Cow-dung burnt dust VIBOOTHI;   Kabalam - Uthiraksham; Flesh : Poosani; Blood : Kunkumam; Red flowers<br />  like Arali - Sembaruthi replaced certain organs and SLOWLY NON-<br />  VIOLENCE or KOLLAMAI (Not causing Death to Animals in Religeous<br />  rituals) was practised in these 6 systems of worship also.</p>
<p>  By this process, the SPECIALITY of Non-Violence preached in Buddism<br />  and Jainism started losing their significance and these two Faiths<br />  moved towards East / Far East away from their Mother land India ...</p>
<p>  This was the kind of India prevailed between 3rd BC and 6th AD ..</p>
<p>  Which lead to BAKTHI MOVEMENT in about 7th / 8th AD ..</p>
<p>  AZHWARs and NAAYANMARs are pearls selected from the ocean of this<br />  Bakthi movement ... brewing to Vaishnava - Siva differences later.</p>

<p>    Dear All-</p>
<p>yan glory and?the brief northern domination of Pallavas the Tamil region has been adorned with temple architectures, some small, some really big, some rock cut that survived the wearing of times, wars and religious ferocity. There are 33,000 plus temples in the land of Tamils, big and small telling the tales of the great kings. But, why none of the forts of Cholas and Pandiyas built survived unlike the ones built by the regional kings in the state of Maharashtra, Karnanataka or Andhrapradesh?? The surviving forts inVellore, Gingi, Dindigul, Mahal of Tirumalai Nayak's are all built by the cheiftains (Nayaks) or kings of Vijaya Nagara empire period post 15 th Century. </p>
<p>    When the glorious days of Cholas ended after 12th Century, looks like the forts and 'aranmanais' Kalki describes in PS vanished with the invasionsof Chalukya,?Vijaya Nagara and Maratha invasions. </p>
<p>    Is this a right observation ? Could the enlightened members please clarify giving historic references ?</p>
<p>    Thanks </p>

<p>    This ancient temple is located in Chennai near St. Thomas Mount. The main diety is Sri Nandheeswarar and Godess is Sri Aavudai Nayagi (Gomathi in Sanskrit).</p>
<p>    Legend says that, there lived a Rishi called 'Bringi Munivar' in the nearby hill and was performing penance worshipping Lord Shiva. As 'Bringi' Rishi was residing, the hill was called as 'Bringi Malai' which is today's 'Parangi Malai' or 'St. Thomas Mount'.</p>
<p>    Pleased by Bringi Rishi's worship, Lord Shiva gave dharshan to him in the form of Nandhi in this holy place and hence the God here is known as Nandheeswarar.</p>
<p>    During later days, a Chola king called "Aadhani Cholan" who was ruling this part of the land, constructed this temple. As this territory was part of his then kingdom, this place was known as "Aadhanippakkam" which turned to be today's "Aadhambakkam" .</p>
<p>    Located very close to St. Thomas Mount Railway Station, this ancient, yet small and beautiful temple has a very holy ambience with ancient architecture and sculptures.</p>
<p>    There was a wall in between the Nandhi and the Sanctum Sanctorum which according to the Sastras is not good for the temple. Sri Paramacharya once visited this place and arranged to remove the obstructing wall between Nandhi and the main Diety.</p>
<p>    Other dieties present here are Pillaiyar, Sri Dhakshinamurthy, Maha Vishnu, Sri Durgai, Bairavar and Navagrahas.</p>
<p>    This temple attracts a huge crowd of devotees on Pradhosham days, as there are special poojas performed here promptly.</p>
<p>    The Bairavar here is also beleived to be more powerful and blessing forwhich many men and women pray to him for marriage or child birth.</p>
<p>    This temple, though located amidst the crowded city, gives that feelingof bliss and provides peace of mind to destress ourselves from today's stressful life.</p>
<p>    This temple will be worth visiting for devotees.</p></ravi_eds@></p></blockquote>

          Temples and Forts of Tamil Nadu        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>sps wrote on 31.1.2008 ::</p>
<p>Bakthi movement :</p>
<p>3rd BC or so :: BUDDISM :: Siddhartha - who relinquished Royalty upon<br />seeing the myseries of downtrodden ENLIGHTENED and became Gauthama,<br />the Buddha, in Patna @ PATALIPUTHRAM in Bihar.</p>
<p>Essential teaching : Relinquish desire. Non Vedic. Non Violence.</p>
<p>3rd BC or so :: JAINISM : Vardhamana MAHAVEERAR - Non Vedic - Non<br />Violence - Swethmabaras (ambaram : clothing; Swetha : white)<br />Digambaras (Digh : Directions - like East / West .. Non-clothing)</p>
<p>PRIOR TO 3rd BC :: SAIVISM was professed in the form of KABALIKAM<br />(Mandaiodu / skull wearers), Kalamughas, Pasupathas .. ( This will<br />lead to very detailed discussion on the Religeous side.. Just ckech<br />archieves under each item .. sure we have discussed earlier many of<br />these). The SIVA identified for these worships was supposedly DANCING<br />ON LIGHT OF THE PYRE OF DEAD-BODIES in CREMATION GROUNDS IN NIGHTS ..<br />FEROCIOUS FORM.</p>
<p>Around this time - say SANGAM AGE in Tamilnadu - KOTRAVAI was under<br />worship.. Recall Thinais : Kurinji - Marudham - Mullai - Neydhal -<br />Paalai :: Muruga - Kannan (Mayon) - Indiran - Siva - Kotravai were in<br />worship.</p>
<p>Siva was known as AALAMAR SELVAN ( Under the Banian Tree) !</p>
<p>Now look at the Siva under the Banian Tree (South) and look at the<br />Ferocious Siva dancing in Cremation Grounds (North) !</p>
<p>There was fusion .. which took several centuries..</p>
<p>A family was created ::</p>
<p>Kotravai was fused with Kali and then in soft form became UMA, who in<br />turn got wedded to Siva, their son became MURUGA (South) @ KARTHIK /<br />KUMARA (North). Maayon became KRISHNA, then became as one of Avatars<br />of VISHNU, who in turn became brother of Uma, Brother-in-law of Siva !</p>
<p>With (Natural) God Surya in position SHAN MADHAS ( 6 Forms of FAITH /<br />Religion) was systemised :<br />SAIVAM - VAISHNAVAM - GOUMARAM (Kumaran / Muruga), SAAKTHAM (After<br />SAKTHI), GANAPATHYAM (After Ganapathy) and SOURABAM (After Surya / Sun<br />God) and accordingly SAPTHA (SEVEN) MATRIKAS - Goumari, Varahi,<br />Indirani etc., were also in position..( Indiran became an outcast.)</p>
<p>With these 6 systems of worship in position and Ferocious form of Siva<br />worship diluted, PYRE DUST became Cow-dung burnt dust VIBOOTHI; Kabalam - Uthiraksham; Flesh : Poosani; Blood : Kunkumam; Red flowers<br />like Arali - Sembaruthi replaced certain organs and SLOWLY NON-<br />VIOLENCE or KOLLAMAI (Not causing Death to Animals in Religeous<br />rituals) was practised in these 6 systems of worship also.</p>
<p>By this process, the SPECIALITY of Non-Violence preached in Buddism<br />and Jainism started losing their significance and these two Faiths<br />moved towards East / Far East away from their Mother land India ...</p>
<p>This was the kind of India prevailed between 3rd BC and 6th AD ..</p>
<p>Which lead to BAKTHI MOVEMENT in about 7th / 8th AD ..</p>
<p>AZHWARs and NAAYANMARs are pearls selected from the ocean of this<br />Bakthi movement ... brewing to Vaishnava - Siva differences later.</p>
<p>We will conclude this with a FOCUS on the Fact that to spread a form<br />of Faith, it has become necessary to make the King follow that Faith !</p>

<p>  Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>  Aditha Chozhan expanded Vijayalaya's kingdom around Thanjai towards Kanchi<br />  outskirts - touching Chingleput and around..</p>
<p>  Therefore it should have connections with Aditha Chozhan only.</p>
<p>  Will check for more details.</p>
<p>  The details provided by you are very intersting.. thanks.</p>

<p>    Visited this temple early today and here is what I came to know</p>
<p>    Adhambakkam was derived from Aadhani Chola - ever heard of him ??<br />  (Aadhani pakkam --  Adhambakkam) .<br />    Kulothunga III allocated lands and renovated the temple.</p>
<p>    Interesting things are<br />    Lord Nandheeswarar facing Surya (inside prakaram)<br />    Bhariava inside prakaram<br />    Vishnu is on the back wall of Nandheeswarar<br />    Avudaiyamman was facing south</p>
<p>    So - another temple for the chola enthu's...</p>
<p>    PS: Temple is very ancient, though i could find people on the sides of<br />  the temple performing early morning rituals which made me think...<br />    ...aayiram irunthum... no peace of mind !</p>
<p>    More from the Net on the temple.</p>
<p>    This ancient temple is located in Chennai near St. Thomas Mount. The main<br />  diety is Sri Nandheeswarar and Godess is Sri Aavudai Nayagi (Gomathi in<br />  Sanskrit).</p>
<p>    Legend says that, there lived a Rishi called 'Bringi Munivar' in the<br />  nearby hill and was performing penance worshipping Lord Shiva. As 'Bringi'<br />  Rishi was residing, the hill was called as 'Bringi Malai' which is today's<br />  'Parangi Malai' or 'St. Thomas Mount'.</p>
<p>    Pleased by Bringi Rishi's worship, Lord Shiva gave dharshan to him in the<br />  form of Nandhi in this holy place and hence the God here is known as<br />  Nandheeswarar.</p>
<p>    During later days, a Chola king called "Aadhani Cholan" who was ruling<br />  this part of the land, constructed this temple. As this territory was part<br />  of his then kingdom, this place was known as "Aadhanippakkam" which turned<br />  to be today's "Aadhambakkam" .</p>
<p>    Located very close to St. Thomas Mount Railway Station, this ancient, yet<br />  small and beautiful temple has a very holy ambience with ancient<br />  architecture and sculptures.</p>
<p>    There was a wall in between the Nandhi and the Sanctum Sanctorum which<br />  according to the Sastras is not good for the temple. Sri Paramacharya once<br />  visited this place and arranged to remove the obstructing wall between<br />  Nandhi and the main Diety.</p>
<p>    Other dieties present here are Pillaiyar, Sri Dhakshinamurthy, Maha<br />  Vishnu, Sri Durgai, Bairavar and Navagrahas.</p>
<p>    This temple attracts a huge crowd of devotees on Pradhosham days, as<br />  there are special poojas performed here promptly.</p>
<p>    The Bairavar here is also beleived to be more powerful and blessing for<br />  which many men and women pray to him for marriage or child birth.</p>
<p>    This temple, though located amidst the crowded city, gives that feeling<br />  of bliss and provides peace of mind to destress ourselves from today's<br />  stressful life.</p>
<p>    This temple will be worth visiting for devotees.</p></ravi_eds@..></ponniyinselvan%40yahoogroups.com></p>
