<blockquote><p>  But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages of his characters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not exactly. Kalki did err (???) as in many other instances.</p>
<p>mudal pagam - Puthu vellam - adyayam 14 - Arulmozhivarmar. ..<br />AVM is introduced in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  for the first time...as he prepares to leave for Lanka war. when he meets Vanathi first (she faints - nadaga mayil :) )</p>
<p>"அருள்மொழிவர்மருக்கு அப்போது பிராயம் பத்தொன்பதுதான்." - ie. when he wished to go to Lanka war, Kalki says, he was just 19. And in next para says Kundavai is 2 years elder to him. so she is 21.</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Story happens after a few months ( or a year later) after this incident.So by then AVM should be 20 and Kundavai 22.</p>
<p>AK, assuming 2 years elder to Kundavai should be 24.</p>
<p>So the heroins, as per kalki are in late teens or early 20's. </p>

<p>Ref ur email : Karikalan went to Sevur at 12 and The Final Pandya war was when he was around 16 or 17..That means Kundavai and Nandhini were15 or 16</p>
<p>While I tend to agree with your timelines for AK, how are you assuming thatKundavai was 15/16 when VP was killed? Kalki does not mention the age gaps between the siblings, doe he ?</p>

<p>Dear Natarajan <br />I beg to differ regarding the age of Kalkis charectors.. .</p>
<p>Karikalan went to Sevur at 12 and The Final Pandya war was when he was around 16 or 17..<br />That means Kundavai and Nandhini were15 or 16</p>
<p>The story happens 3 years after that Making <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym 20 Nandhini 19 Kundavai 19 and <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym gets killed after a year vandiyadevan recollects a second pudhuvellam</p>
<p>So realistically <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym must have been 21/22<br />Vandiyadevan 20/21</acronym></p>
<p>Kundavai/Nandhini? madhuranthakan and Senthan 20ish<br />Arunmozhi 18/19<br />Poonguzhali Vanathi Manimegali 17-19</p>
<p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym meets Nandhini when he is 12...he gets infactuated/ falls in love when he is 16/17 so nandhini cannot be 9</p>
<p>Likewise the rest of the charectors.. .</p>
<p>Maniam and Vinus pictures mirror such developed women not kids unfortuntely</p>
<p>Sri</p>
<p>/Approximate estimate at time of AK's death<br />according to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Time line -<br />Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavaibeing elder to them)</acronym></p>
<p>Approx age when they fell in love<br />Nandhini - 7-10<br />Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />poongulazhi also around same time<br />Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser//<br /> <br /> <br />Reasonable estimates. <br />But how you got Poongkuzali' s age?<br />I am curious.<br /> <br />sn.</p>

<p>950 - Gandaraditya Chola crowned (also Yuvaraja was also crowned Sundara Chola)</p>
<p>So according Kalki Sundara was not married when he was made Yuvraja.</p>
<p>----The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war, "Parantaka II caused rivers of blood to flow". Other inscriptions mention that Parantaka and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II) defeated Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the battlefield. The young son aditya who took to battle field at the age of "fifteen" and who was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely praised for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at "military training sessions".-- --from wiki</p>
<p>birth date of Aditya<br />959-15= 944</p>
<p>But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950.. So it simply means Sundara was married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>So lets assume he got married before being<br />Yuvraja,<br />but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani getspregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2 = 952 should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym assassination 969</p>
<p>969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />959-952= Age of Nandhini when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in love before the battle./.. which angered <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini' s age is 10 at the time of marriage.</p>
<p>But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages ofhis characters.</p>
<p>for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age <br />assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates) age of the<br />younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's assassination.</p>
<p>When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10 year old Male as a child like charcater ..was <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  out of place considering <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ,<acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Time line -<br />Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavaibeing elder to them)</acronym></p>
<p>Approx age when they fell in love<br />Nandhini - 7-10<br />Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />poongulazhi also around same time<br />Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>Time lines of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!! !</p>
<p>But Historically,<br /><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was 24 when he died.<br />This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years<br />difference.<br />Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym died since she might have brought up <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of 2-3 years to show the mother like love on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym )<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.</p>
<p>So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if notmore. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with her!!!...so by all probability it is possible that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  and Kundhavai were married long before AK's death!!!!!!! !!!!!</p>

<p>    But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages of his characters.</p>
<p>  Not exactly. Kalki did err (???) as in many other instances.</p>
<p>  mudal pagam - Puthu vellam - adyayam 14 - Arulmozhivarmar...<br />  AVM is introduced in PS for the first time...as he prepares to leave for Lanka war. when he meets Vanathi first (she faints - nadaga mayil :) )</p>
<p>  "அருள்மொழிவர்மருக்கு அப்போது பிராயம் பத்தொன்பதுதான்." - ie. when he wished to go to Lanka war, Kalki says, he was just 19. And in next para says Kundavai is 2 years elder to him. so she is 21.</p>
<p>  PS Story happens after a few months ( or a year later) after this incident. So by then AVM should be 20 and Kundavai 22.</p>
<p>  AK, assuming 2 years elder to Kundavai should be 24.</p>
<p>  So the heroins, as per kalki are in late teens or early 20's. </p>

<p>  Hi Sri</p>
<p>  Ref ur email : Karikalan went to Sevur at 12 and The Final Pandya war waswhen he was around 16 or 17..That means Kundavai and Nandhini were15 or 16</p>
<p>  While I tend to agree with your timelines for AK, how are you assuming that Kundavai was 15/16 when VP was killed? Kalki does not mention the age gaps between the siblings, doe he ?</p>

<p>  Dear Natarajan <br />  I beg to differ regarding the age of Kalkis charectors...</p>
<p>  Karikalan went to Sevur at 12 and The Final Pandya war was when he was around 16 or 17..<br />  That means Kundavai and Nandhini were15 or 16</p>
<p>  The story happens 3 years after that Making AK 20 Nandhini 19 Kundavai 19and AK gets killed after a year vandiyadevan recollects a second pudhuvellam</p>
<p>  So realistically AK must have been 21/22<br />  Vandiyadevan 20/21<br />  Kundavai/Nandhini?madhuranthakan and Senthan 20ish<br />  Arunmozhi 18/19<br />  Poonguzhali Vanathi Manimegali 17-19</p>
<p>  AK meets Nandhini when he is 12...he gets infactuated/falls in love when he is 16/17 so nandhini cannot be 9<br />  Likewise the rest of the charectors...</p>
<p>  Maniam and Vinus pictures mirror such developed women not kids unfortuntely</p>
<p>  Sri</p>
<p>  /Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to PS Time line -<br />  Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />  Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />  Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />  Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavai being elder to them)</p>
<p>  Approx age when they fell in love<br />  Nandhini - 7-10<br />  Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />  poongulazhi also around same time<br />  Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser// <br />   <br />   <br />  Reasonable estimates. <br />  But how you got Poongkuzali' s age?<br />  I am curious.<br />   sn.</p>

        <p>I think Kalki gives the age difference of <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym and Kundhavai as 5. I'm not sure. And in 4th part he says that <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym is 24 through Malayaman's words...</p>

<p>Not exactly. Kalki did err (???) as in many other instances.</p>
<p>mudal pagam - Puthu vellam - adyayam 14 - Arulmozhivarmar...<br />AVM is introduced in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  for the first time...as he prepares to leave for Lanka war. when he meets Vanathi first (she faints - nadaga mayil :) )</p>
<p>"அருள்மொழிவர்மருக்கு அப்போது பிராயம் பத்தொன்பதுதான்." - ie. when he wished to go to Lanka war, Kalki says, he was just 19. And in next para says Kundavai is 2 years elder to him. so she is 21.</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Story happens after a few months ( or a year later) after this incident.So by then AVM should be 20 and Kundavai 22.</p>
<p>AK, assuming 2 years elder to Kundavai should be 24.</p>
<p>So the heroins, as per kalki are in late teens or early 20's. </p>

<p>Dear Natarajan <br />I beg to differ regarding the age of Kalkis charectors...</p>
<p>Karikalan went to Sevur at 12 and The Final Pandya war was when he was around 16 or 17..<br />That means Kundavai and Nandhini were15 or 16</p>
<p>The story happens 3 years after that Making <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym 20 Nandhini 19 Kundavai 19 and <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym gets killed after a year vandiyadevan recollects a second pudhuvellam</p>
<p>So realistically <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym must have been 21/22<br />Vandiyadevan 20/21<br />Kundavai/Nandhini?madhuranthakan and Senthan 20ish<br />Arunmozhi 18/19<br />Poonguzhali Vanathi Manimegali 17-19</acronym></p>
<p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym meets Nandhini when he is 12...he gets infactuated/falls in love when heis 16/17 so nandhini cannot be 9<br />Likewise the rest of the charectors...</acronym></p>
<p>Maniam and Vinus pictures mirror such developed women not kids unfortuntely</p>
<p>Sri</p>
<p>/Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Time line -<br />Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavaibeing elder to them)</acronym></p>
<p>Approx age when they fell in love<br />Nandhini - 7-10<br />Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />poongulazhi also around same time<br />Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser// <br /> <br /> <br />Reasonable estimates. <br />But how you got Poongkuzali' s age?<br />I am curious.<br /> sn.</p>

<p>VJ You left the most important year!</p>
<p>950 - Gandaraditya Chola crowned (also Yuvaraja was also crowned Sundara Chola)</p>
<p>So according Kalki Sundara was not married when he was made Yuvraja.</p>
<p>----The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war, "Parantaka II caused rivers of blood to flow". Other inscriptions mention that Parantaka and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II) defeated Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the battlefield. The young son aditya who took to battle field at the age of "fifteen" and who was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely praised for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at "military training sessions".-- --from wiki</p>
<p>birth date of Aditya<br />959-15= 944</p>
<p>But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950.. So it simply means Sundara was married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>So lets assume he got married before being Yuvraja,<br />but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani getspregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2 = 952 should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym assassination 969<br />969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />959-952= Age of Nandhini when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in love before the battle./.. which angered <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini' s age is 10 at the time of marriage.</p>
<p>But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages ofhis characters.</p>
<p>for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age <br />assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates) age of the younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's assassination.</p>
<p>When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10 year old Male as a child like charcater ..was <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  out of place considering <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ,<acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Time line -<br />Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavaibeing elder to them)</acronym></p>
<p>Approx age when they fell in love<br />Nandhini - 7-10<br />Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />poongulazhi also around same time<br />Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>Time lines of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!! !</p>
<p>But Historically,<br /><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was 24 when he died.<br />This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym died since she might have brought up <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of 2-3 years to show the mother like love on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym )<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if notmore. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with her!!!...so by all probability it is possible that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  and Kundhavai were married long before AK's death!!!!!!! !!!!!</p>

<p>  Dear Natarajan<br />  I beg to differ regarding the age of Kalkis charectors...</p>
<p>  Karikalan went to Sevur at 12 and The Final Pandya war was when he was<br />  around 16 or 17..<br />  That means Kundavai and Nandhini were15 or 16</p>
<p>  The story happens 3 years after that Making AK 20 Nandhini 19 Kundavai 19<br />  and AK gets killed after a year vandiyadevan recollects a second pudhuvellam</p>
<p>  So realistically AK must have been 21/22<br />  Vandiyadevan 20/21<br />  Kundavai/Nandhini?madhuranthakan and Senthan 20ish<br />  Arunmozhi 18/19<br />  Poonguzhali Vanathi Manimegali 17-19</p>
<p>  AK meets Nandhini when he is 12...he gets infactuated/falls in love when he<br />  is 16/17 so nandhini cannot be 9<br />  Likewise the rest of the charectors...</p>
<p>  Maniam and Vinus pictures mirror such developed women not kids unfortuntely</p>
<p>  Sri</p>
<p>  /Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to PS Time line -<br />  Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />  Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />  Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />  Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavai<br />  being elder to them)</p>

<p>  AK assassination 969<br />  969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />  959-952= Age of Nandhini when AK was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in love<br />  before the battle./.. which angered AK to behead the Pandiya)</p>

<p>  for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age<br />  assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates)<br />  age of the younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's<br />  assassination.</p>
<p>  When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10<br />  year old Male as a child like charcater ..was bit out of place considering<br />  RRC ,AK were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>  Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to PS Time line -<br />  Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />  Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />  Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />  Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavai<br />  being elder to them)</p>

<p>  Time lines of PS and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So<br />  that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!! !</p>
<p>  But Historically,<br />  AK was 24 when he died.<br />  This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />  Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when AK died since she<br />  might have brought up RRC.(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of 2-3<br />  years to show the mother like love on RRC)<br />  RRC ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he<br />  died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />  So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if not<br />  more. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married by 18<br />  they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />  So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married<br />  by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with<br />  her!!!...so by all probability it is possible that VT and Kundhavai were<br />  married long before AK's death!!!!!!! !!!!!</p>

        <p>Hi Sri</p>
<p>Ref ur email : Karikalan went to Sevur at 12 and The Final Pandya war was when he was around 16 or 17..That means Kundavai and Nandhini were15 or 16</p>
<p>While I tend to agree with your timelines for AK, how are you assuming that Kundavai was 15/16 when VP was killed? Kalki does not mention the age gaps between the siblings, doe he ?</p>

<p>Dear Natarajan <br />I beg to differ regarding the age of Kalkis charectors...</p>
<p>Karikalan went to Sevur at 12 and The Final Pandya war was when he was around 16 or 17..<br />That means Kundavai and Nandhini were15 or 16</p>
<p>The story happens 3 years after that Making <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym 20 Nandhini 19 Kundavai 19 and <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym gets killed after a year vandiyadevan recollects a second pudhuvellam</p>
<p>So realistically <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym must have been 21/22<br />Vandiyadevan 20/21<br />Kundavai/Nandhini?madhuranthakan and Senthan 20ish<br />Arunmozhi 18/19<br />Poonguzhali Vanathi Manimegali 17-19</acronym></p>
<p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym meets Nandhini when he is 12...he gets infactuated/falls in love when he is 16/17 so nandhini cannot be 9<br />Likewise the rest of the charectors...</acronym></p>
<p>Maniam and Vinus pictures mirror such developed women not kids unfortuntely</p>
<p>Sri</p>
<p>/Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Time line -<br />Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavai being elder to them)</acronym></p>
<p>Approx age when they fell in love<br />Nandhini - 7-10<br />Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />poongulazhi also around same time<br />Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser// </p>
<p>Reasonable estimates. <br />But how you got Poongkuzali' s age?<br />I am curious.</p>

<p>	VJ You left the most important year!</p>
<p>	950 - Gandaraditya Chola crowned (also Yuvaraja was also crowned Sundara Chola)</p>
<p>	So according Kalki Sundara was not married when he was made Yuvraja.</p>
<p>	----The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war, "Parantaka II caused rivers of blood to flow". Other inscriptions mention that Parantaka and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II) defeated Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the battlefield. The young son aditya who took to battle field at the age of "fifteen" and who was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely praised for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at "military training sessions".-- --from wiki</p>
<p>	birth date of Aditya<br />	959-15= 944</p>
<p>	But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950.. So it simply means Sundara was married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>	So lets assume he got married before being Yuvraja,<br />	but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani gets pregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2 = 952 should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p>	<acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym assassination 969<br />	969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />	959-952= Age of Nandhini when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in love before the battle./.. which angered <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>	Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini' s age is 10 at the time of marriage.</p>
<p>	But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>	Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>	But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages of his characters.</p>
<p>	for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age <br />	assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates) age of the younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's assassination.</p>
<p>	When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10 year old Male as a child like charcater ..was <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  out of place considering <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ,<acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>	Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Time line -<br />	Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />	Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />	Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />	Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavai being elder to them)</acronym></p>
<p>	Approx age when they fell in love<br />	Nandhini - 7-10<br />	Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />	poongulazhi also around same time<br />	Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>	Time lines of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!! !</p>
<p>	But Historically,<br />	<acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was 24 when he died.<br />	This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />	Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym died since she might have brought up <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of 2-3 years to show the mother like love on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym )<br />	<acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />	So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if not more. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />	So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with her!!!...so by all probability it is possible that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  and Kundhavai were married long before AK's death!!!!!!! !!!!!</p>

The young son aditya who took to battle field at the age of "fifteen" and who was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely praised for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at "military training sessions".-- --from wiki</p>
<p>birth date of Aditya<br />959-15= 944</p>
<p>But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950. So it simply means Sundara was married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>So lets assume he got married before being<br />Yuvraja,<br />but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani getspregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2 = 952 should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym assassination 969<br />969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />959-952= Age of Nandhini when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in love before the battle./.. which angered <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini' s age is 10 at the time of marriage.</p>
<p>But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages ofhis characters.</p>
<p>for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age <br />assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates) age of the<br />younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's assassination.</p>
<p>When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10 year old Male as a child like charcater ..was <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  out of place considering <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ,<acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Time line -<br />Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavaibeing elder to them)</acronym></p>
<p>Approx age when they fell in love<br />Nandhini - 7-10<br />Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />poongulazhi also around same time<br />Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>Time lines of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!! !</p>
<p>But Historically,<br /><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was 24 when he died.<br />This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years<br />difference.<br />Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym died since she might have brought up <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of 2-3 years to show the mother like love on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym )<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if notmore. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with her!!!....so by all probability it is possible that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  and Kundhavai were marriedlong before AK's death!!!!!!! !!!!!</p>

<p>hi friends</p>
<p>Please do not mix fact with fiction. Kalki wanted to portray all his Kings as ideal men. The Mandakini episode was entirely Sri Kalki's fiction and inorder to inlay that into Sundara's ascension, there are some glaring holes in the timeline.</p>
<p>Similar too is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  marrying Vananthi - <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  timeline n narration is very difffrom fact. </p>

        <p>Yes, Thats true. As per the novel <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Arulmozhi varman not married Vanathi till the end of story, but Athitha Karikalan was assasinated before this, amI right. And also if Mandhakini was a fiction why Raja Raja Chozhan built a temple for her. I think The temple is called "Chingachiyar Koil" or Singala Naachiyaar Koil, is located some miles from Tanjore.<br />?<br />Thank you.</acronym></p>

<p>hi friends</p>
<p>Please do not mix fact with fiction. Kalki wanted to portray all his Kings as ideal men. The Mandakini episode was entirely Sri Kalki's fiction and inorder to inlay that into Sundara's ascension, there are some glaring holes in the timeline.</p>
<p>Similar too is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  marrying Vananthi - <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  timeline n narration is very difffrom fact. </p>

        <p>hi friends</p>
<p>Please do not mix fact with fiction. Kalki wanted to portray all his Kings<br />as ideal men. The Mandakini episode was entirely Sri Kalki's fiction and<br />inorder to inlay that into Sundara's ascension, there are some glaring holes<br />in the timeline.</p>
<p>Similar too is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  marrying Vananthi - <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  timeline n narration is very diff<br />from fact.</acronym></p>

<p>1. He had only one major publication.</p>
<p>2. It was written in Aramaic, not in English.</p>
<p>3. It has no references.</p>
<p>4. It wasn't even published in a refereed journal.</p>
<p>5. There are serious doubts he wrote it himself.</p>
<p>6. It may be true that he created the world, but what has he done since</p>
<p>then?</p>
<p>7. His cooperative efforts have been quite limited.</p>
<p>8. The Scientific community has had a hard time replicating his results.</p>
<p>9. He unlawfully performed not only Animal, but *Human* testing.</p>
<p>10. When one experiment went awry, he tried to cover it by drowning his<br />subjects.</p>
<p>11. When subjects didn't behave as predicted, he deleted them from</p>
<p>the sample.</p>
<p>12. He rarely came to class, just told his students to read the book.</p>
<p>13. Some say he had his son to teach the class.</p>
<p>14. He expelled his first two students for learning.</p>
<p>15. Although there were only 10 requirements, most of his students</p>
<p>failed his tests.</p>
<p>16. His office hours were infrequent and usually held on a mountain top.</p>

<p>was discussing with vairam last night. the famous song which kalki shows the<br />past fame of <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym 's Vanar kulam. but which collection is this verse from??</p>
<p>வாணர்கள்</p>
<p>"சேனை தழையாக்கிச் செங்குருதி நீர்தேக்கி<br />ஆனை மிதித்த அருஞ்சேற்றில் - மானபரன்<br />பாவேந்தர் தம்வேந்தன் வாணன் பறித்து<br />நட்டான் மூவேந்தர் தங்கள் முடி!"</p>
<p>"என் கவிகை என் சிவிகை<br />என் கவசம் என்துவசம்</p>
<p>என்கரி யீ(து) என்பரி யீது என்பரே -<br />மன்கவன மாவேந்தன்<br />வாணன் வரிசைப் பரிசு<br />பெற்ற பாவேந்தரை, வேந்தர் பார்த்து!"</p>
<p>"வாணன் புகழுரையா வாயுண்டோ மாகதர்கோன்<br />வாணன் பெயரெழுதா மார்புண்டோ - வாணன்<br />கொடிதாங்கி நில்லாத கொம்புண்டோ உண்டோ</p>

<p>      we never got a feeling nandini, mathuranthakan and sendan were of the<br />  same<br />      age</p>
<p>      and by the way does kalki ever say aditya was younger or elder than<br />      mathuranthakan</p>

<p>       VJ You left the most important year!</p>
<p>       950 - Gandaraditya Chola crowned (also Yuvaraja was also crowned<br />  Sundara<br />       Chola)</p>
<p>       So according Kalki Sundara was not married when he was made Yuvraja.</p>
<p>       ----The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war,<br />  "Parantaka II<br />       caused rivers of blood to flow". Other inscriptions mention that<br />  Parantaka<br />       and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II)<br />       defeated Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the<br />       battlefield. The young son aditya who took to battle field at the age<br />  of<br />       "fifteen" and who was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely<br />  praised<br />       for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he<br />  was at<br />       "military training sessions".----from wiki</p>
<p>       birth date of Aditya<br />       959-15= 944</p>
<p>       But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950. So it simply means Sundara was<br />       married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>       So lets assume he got married before being Yuvraja,<br />       but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani<br />       gets pregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2<br />  =<br />       952 should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p>       AK assassination 969<br />       969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />       959-952= Age of Nandhini when AK was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in<br />       love before the battle./.. which angered AK to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>       Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of<br />  Veera<br />       pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini's age is 10 at the<br />  time<br />       of marriage.</p>
<p>       But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>       Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>       But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the<br />  ages<br />       of his characters.</p>
<p>       for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age<br />       assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months<br />  lates)<br />       age of the younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's<br />       assassination.</p>
<p>       When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a<br />  10<br />       year old Male as a child like charcater ..was bit out of place<br />  considering<br />       RRC ,AK were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>       Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to PS Time line-<br />       Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />       Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />       Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />       Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and<br />       Kunthavai being elder to them)</p>
<p>       Approx age when they fell in love<br />       Nandhini - 7-10<br />       Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />       poongulazhi also around same time<br />       Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>       Time lines of PS and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places.<br />  So<br />       that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!!!</p>
<p>       But Historically,<br />       AK was 24 when he died.<br />       This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />       Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when AK died since she<br />       might have brought up RRC.(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff<br />  of<br />       2-3 years to show the mother like love on RRC)<br />       RRC ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years.<br />  Assuming he<br />       died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />       So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old<br />  if<br />       not more. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not<br />  married<br />       by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />       So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not<br />  married<br />       by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with<br />       her!!!...so by all probability it is possible that VT and Kundhavai<br />  were<br />       married long before AK's death!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>     950 - Gandaraditya Chola crowned (also Yuvaraja was also crowned Sundara<br />     Chola)</p>
<p>     So according Kalki Sundara was not married when he was made Yuvraja.</p>
<p>     ----The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war, "Parantaka II<br />     caused rivers of blood to flow". Other inscriptions mention that Parantaka<br />     and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II)<br />     defeated Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the<br />     battlefield. The young son aditya who took to battle field at the age of<br />     "fifteen" and who was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely praised<br />     for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at<br />     "military training sessions".----from wiki</p>
<p>     birth date of Aditya<br />     959-15= 944</p>
<p>     But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950. So it simply means Sundara was<br />     married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>     So lets assume he got married before being Yuvraja,<br />     but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani<br />     gets pregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2=<br />     952 should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p>     AK assassination 969<br />     969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />     959-952= Age of Nandhini when AK was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in<br />     love before the battle./.. which angered AK to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>     Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera<br />     pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini's age is 10 at the time<br />     of marriage.</p>
<p>     But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>     Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>     But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages<br />     of his characters.</p>
<p>     for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age<br />     assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates)<br />     age of the younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's<br />     assassination.</p>
<p>     When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10<br />     year old Male as a child like charcater ..was bit out of place considering<br />     RRC ,AK were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>     Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to PS Time line -<br />     Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />     Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />     Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />     Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and<br />     Kunthavai being elder to them)</p>
<p>     Approx age when they fell in love<br />     Nandhini - 7-10<br />     Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />     poongulazhi also around same time<br />     Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>     Time lines of PS and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So<br />     that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!!!</p>
<p>     But Historically,<br />     AK was 24 when he died.<br />     This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />     Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when AK died since she<br />     might have brought up RRC.(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of<br />     2-3 years to show the mother like love on RRC)<br />     RRC ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he<br />     died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />     So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if<br />     not more. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married<br />     by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />     So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married<br />     by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with<br />     her!!!...so by all probability it is possible that VT and Kundhavai were<br />     married long before AK's death!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>  AK assassination 969<br />  969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />  959-952= Age of Nandhini when AK was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in love before the battle./.. which angered AK to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>  Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini' s age is 10 at the timeof marriage.</p>
<p>  But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>  Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>  But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages of his characters.</p>
<p>  for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age <br />  assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates) age of the younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's assassination.</p>
<p>  When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10 year old Male as a child like charcater ..was bit out of place considering RRC ,AK were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>  Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to PS Time line -<br />  Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />  Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />  Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />  Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavai being elder to them)</p>
<p>  Approx age when they fell in love<br />  Nandhini - 7-10<br />  Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />  poongulazhi also around same time<br />  Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>  Time lines of PS and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!! !</p>
<p>  But Historically,<br />  AK was 24 when he died.<br />  This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />  Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when AK died since she might have brought up RRC.(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of 2-3 years to show the mother like love on RRC)<br />  RRC ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />  So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if not more. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married by18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />  So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not marriedby 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with her!!!....so by all probability it is possible that VT and Kundhavai were married long before AK's death!!!!!!! !!!!!</p>

<p>But Historically,<br /><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was 24 when he died.<br />This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym died since she might have brought up <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of 2-3 years to show the mother like love on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym )<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if notmore. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with her!!!....so by all probability it is possible that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  and Kundhavai were marriedlong before AK's death!!!!!!! !!!!!</p>

<p>  So according Kalki Sundara was not married when he was made Yuvraja.</p>
<p>  ----The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war, "Parantaka II<br />  caused rivers of blood to flow". Other inscriptions mention that Parantaka<br />  and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II) defeated<br />  Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the battlefield. The<br />  young son aditya who took to battle field at the age of "fifteen" and who<br />  was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely praised for having<br />  conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at "military<br />  training sessions".----from wiki</p>
<p>  birth date of Aditya<br />  959-15= 944</p>
<p>  But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950. So it simply means Sundara was<br />  married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>  So lets assume he got married before being Yuvraja,<br />  but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani gets<br />  pregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2 = 952<br />  should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p>  AK assassination 969<br />  969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />  959-952= Age of Nandhini when AK was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in love<br />  before the battle./.. which angered AK to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>  Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera<br />  pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini's age is 10 at the time of<br />  marriage.</p>
<p>  But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>  Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>  But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages of<br />  his characters.</p>
<p>  for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age<br />  assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates)<br />  age of the younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's<br />  assassination.</p>
<p>  When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10<br />  year old Male as a child like charcater ..was bit out of place considering<br />  RRC ,AK were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>  Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to PS Time line -<br />  Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />  Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />  Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />  Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavai<br />  being elder to them)</p>
<p>  Approx age when they fell in love<br />  Nandhini - 7-10<br />  Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />  poongulazhi also around same time<br />  Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>

Assuming he<br />  died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />  So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if not<br />  more.

<p>Probably to develop the story , is there any record on her marriage?</p>
<p>That would Put Kundhavi nearly 20,21 when she was married. Thats like getting married at 30-35 in present times - too late!!!...Probably Kundhavai waslike sister in Tamil cinema who brings up her young brother and doesn't marry till very late time to bring up her brother!!!!</p>

<p>     950 - Gandaraditya Chola crowned (also Yuvaraja was also crowned Sundara<br />     Chola)</p>
<p>     So according Kalki Sundara was not married when he was made Yuvraja.</p>
<p>     ----The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war, "Parantaka II<br />     caused rivers of blood to flow". Other inscriptions mention that Parantaka<br />     and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II)<br />     defeated Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the<br />     battlefield. The young son aditya who took to battle field at the age of<br />     "fifteen" and who was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely praised<br />     for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at<br />     "military training sessions".----from wiki</p>
<p>     birth date of Aditya<br />     959-15= 944</p>
<p>     But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950. So it simply means Sundara was<br />     married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>     So lets assume he got married before being Yuvraja,<br />     but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani<br />     gets pregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2=<br />     952 should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p>     AK assassination 969<br />     969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />     959-952= Age of Nandhini when AK was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in<br />     love before the battle./.. which angered AK to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>     Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera<br />     pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini's age is 10 at the time<br />     of marriage.</p>
<p>     But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>     Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>     But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages<br />     of his characters.</p>
<p>     for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age<br />     assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates)<br />     age of the younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's<br />     assassination.</p>
<p>     When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10<br />     year old Male as a child like charcater ..was bit out of place considering<br />     RRC ,AK were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>     Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to PS Time line -<br />     Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />     Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />     Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />     Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and<br />     Kunthavai being elder to them)</p>
<p>     Approx age when they fell in love<br />     Nandhini - 7-10<br />     Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />     poongulazhi also around same time<br />     Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>     Time lines of PS and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So<br />     that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!!!</p>
<p>     But Historically,<br />     AK was 24 when he died.<br />     This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />     Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when AK died since she<br />     might have brought up RRC.(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of<br />     2-3 years to show the mother like love on RRC)<br />     RRC ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he<br />     died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />     So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if<br />     not more. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married<br />     by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />     So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married<br />     by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with<br />     her!!!...so by all probability it is possible that VT and Kundhavai were<br />     married long before AK's death!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>   When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10<br />   year old Male as a child like charcater ..was bit out of place considering<br />   RRC ,AK were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>   Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to PS Time line -<br />   Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />   Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />   Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />   Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and<br />   Kunthavai being elder to them)</p>
<p>   Approx age when they fell in love<br />   Nandhini - 7-10<br />   Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />   poongulazhi also around same time<br />   Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>   Time lines of PS and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So<br />   that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!!!</p>
<p>   But Historically,<br />   AK was 24 when he died.<br />   This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />   Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when AK died since she<br />   might have brought up RRC.(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of<br />   2-3 years to show the mother like love on RRC)<br />   RRC ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he<br />   died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />   So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if<br />   not more. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married<br />   by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />   So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married<br />   by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with<br />   her!!!...so by all probability it is possible that VT and Kundhavai were<br />   married long before AK's death!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>i too got a feeling that kalki didnt take the age of chaecters too seriously</p>
<p>we never got a feeling nandini, mathuranthakan and sendan were of the same age</p>
<p>and by the way does kalki ever say aditya was younger or elder than mathuranthakan</p>

<blockquote><p>  VJ You left the most important year!</p>
<p>  950 - Gandaraditya Chola crowned (also Yuvaraja was also crowned Sundara Chola)</p>
<p>  So according Kalki Sundara was not married when he was made Yuvraja.</p>
<p>  ----The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war, "Parantaka II caused rivers of blood to flow". Other inscriptions mention that Parantaka and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II) defeated Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the battlefield.The young son aditya who took to battle field at the age of "fifteen" and who was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely praised for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at "military training sessions".----from wiki</p>
<p>  birth date of Aditya<br />  959-15= 944</p>
<p>  But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950. So it simply means Sundara was married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>  So lets assume he got married before being Yuvraja,<br />  but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani gets pregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2 = 952 should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p>  AK assassination 969<br />  969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />  959-952= Age of Nandhini when AK was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in love before the battle./.. which angered AK to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>  Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini's age is 10 at the time of marriage.</p>
<p>  But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>  Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>  But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages of his characters.</p>

<p>  Approx age when they fell in love<br />  Nandhini - 7-10<br />  Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />  poongulazhi also around same time<br />  Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>  Time lines of PS and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!!!</p>

          age of heroines        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>VJ You left the most important year!</p>
<p>950 - Gandaraditya Chola crowned (also Yuvaraja was also crowned Sundara Chola)</p>
<p>So according Kalki Sundara was not married when he was made Yuvraja.</p>
<p>----The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war, "Parantaka II caused rivers of blood to flow". Other inscriptions mention that Parantaka and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II) defeated Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the battlefield. The young son aditya who took to battle field at the age of "fifteen" and who was a " very abhimanyu " in valour, is profusely praised for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at "military training sessions".----from wiki</p>
<p>birth date of Aditya<br />959-15= 944</p>
<p>But Sundara made Yuvraja only in 950. So it simply means Sundara was married when he met Umai rani!!!</p>
<p>So lets assume he got married before being Yuvraja,<br />but in Nandhini's father discussion some body discussed that umai rani getspregnent only after year after Sundara becomes yuvaraja. So 950+2 = 952 should be approx birth date of the twins.</p>
<p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym assassination 969<br />969-952= Age of Nandhini=17 or lesser<br />959-952= Age of Nandhini when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was in love=7 !!!! (they both were in love before the battle./.. which angered <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym to behead the Pandiya)</p>
<p>Periya pazhuvettayar married nandhini immediately after the death of Veera pandiya even if we keep 3 years later...Nandhini's age is 10 at the time ofmarriage.</p>
<p>But we all know Nandhini was elder to Kundhavai.</p>
<p>Assuming a two year gap Kundhavai age would be 15 or lesser.</p>
<p>But one thing for sure is Kalki didnt have clear cut idea about the ages ofhis characters.</p>
<p>for eg. Pandiyas son who is under Nandhini , lets see his age <br />assuming he was born when pandiya was beheaded(or atleast 10 months lates) age of the younger Pandiya was 9-10 or more years old during Ak's assassination.</p>
<p>When there are princes going to war at the age of 12, Kalki showing a 10 year old Male as a child like charcater ..was <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  out of place considering <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ,<acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym were close to fighting a war at the age 12-14!</p>
<p>Approximate estimate at time of AK's death according to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Time line -<br />Nandhini - 17 or lesser<br />Kundhavai - 15 or lesser<br />Poongulazhli - 15 or lesser<br />Vanathi, Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser (bcos of the innocence and Kunthavaibeing elder to them)</acronym></p>
<p>Approx age when they fell in love<br />Nandhini - 7-10<br />Kundhavai - 14-15 or lesser<br />poongulazhi also around same time<br />Vanathi and Manimekalai - 12-14 or lesser</p>
<p>Time lines of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and Timelines of Cholas dont match in lot of places. So that screws up whole idea of finding the ages of the characters!!!</p>
<p>But Historically,<br /><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was 24 when he died.<br />This makes Kunthavai around 18 if they 6 years difference.<br />Kunthavai should have been around 18-20 or more when <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym died since she might have brought up <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .(Atleast I feel there must been an age diff of 2-3 years to show the mother like love on <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym )<br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  ruled for 29 years and has been crown prince for 15 years. Assuming he died around 60-65 that puts his age to 15-20 at death of AK.<br />So most probably the historical Kundhavai was around 18-20 years old if notmore. Think about it ...some 20-25 years ago if a girl is not married by 18 they would feel there is some thing wrong with her.<br />So when the age limit was 12 to get married, if Kundhavai was not married by 18-20 surely people would have felt something is surely wrong with her!!!...so by all probability it is possible that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VT</acronym  and Kundhavai were married long before AK's death!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>  I guess the PS story starts off may be 8 yrears after these events (???)<br />  Coz i think somewhere it is mentioned that AK was 20 during the events of<br />  PS and when he died (need to refer this again) .</p>
<p>  So if this is right, Nandhini would be arnd 20, Kundhavai and little<br />  younger, maybe 16 or 17.</p>

<p>         Even if we consider certain food habit and customs and so an at<br />   best we can push it to 15, not earlier.</p>
<p>   I know people who have had their first kid at age of 14. Mostly my moms<br />   generation in my community got married off by the time they were 14-15. My<br />   grand mother generation probably 2 years lesser than that. These aren't<br />   child marriage. The girls would have attained their puberty by then.</p>
<p>   In book "Home life among Tamils" the author goes on to say average age of<br />   the women attaining puberty in Tamil land is around 12-14.</p>
<p>   Silapadikaram - 6th century mentions age of Kovalan Kannagi marraige age<br />   as 12&amp;16<br />   Nachinarkiniyar - 10th century -says correct marraige age for womenand<br />   menare 12&amp;16. He also mentionsthat girls attain puberty by 12-13.<br />   Kasiappa Sivachariyar - 14 th century - says in his Kantha puranam that<br />   Valli was 12 whenshe fell in love with Murugan</p>
<p>   Even if it seems like a poetic exaggeration. .. rite from 1AD to 14 AD it<br />   has been quoted women fall in love as early as 12 in Literature and Girls<br />   having childeren at 14 as late as 20 th century.. gives a very high<br />   probablity that there are lot of chances that the average age gals attain<br />   puberty in the old time was around 12 and the naiveness and ignorance of<br />   gals can lead upto love(these days we call infatuation ) ..</p>
<p>   So logically these girls should been married by upper limit 14. If in 10th<br />   century norm was getting married at the age of 12 was present ,then no king<br />   would allow his daughter to cross that age and be single.<br />   Historical Kundhavai should have been married before or by 14.</p>
<p>   So this is why had given age of the heroines as 12-14. I am not very sure<br />   about Kalki imagination but if Kundhavai was married in 10th century , she<br />   would got married before she was 14!</p>

<p>     Vairam, marriage is different from falling in love. Even my grandparents<br />   and their parents married around ages 8-12. My paternal grandmotehr was 7.5<br />   years while she was 'married'.</p>
<p>     Falling in love with another human is technically impossible before<br />   hormonal maturity. Nature has made it that way. Even if we consider certain<br />   food habit and customs and so an at best we can push it to 15, not earlier.<br />   If poets wrote 10-12 as the age they were just trying to engage is poetic<br />   exaggeration or somehow justify the norms of that time.</p>

<p>       Some thing you should consider here....<br />       The events take place in 10th century.<br />       Looking at literature, you will come to know that ideal age of<br />   marraige of a girl is 12 and of a guy is 16.<br />       It is confirmed in Silapadikaram(<a href="http://karkanirka" title="http://karkanirka">http://karkanirka</a>. wordpress.<br />   com/2008/ 04/28/silapadiga ram-part- 1/<http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/silapadigaram-part-1/ )<br />   and also Nachnarkinniyar works which are around 10th century.</http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/silapadigaram-part-1/></p>
<p>       Ages of Girls are classfied in 7 stages<br />       pethai 5-7<br />       pethumbai- 8-11<br />       Mankai - 12- 13 - where she blossoms into maiden.<br />       Matandai - 14-19<br />       Arivai - around 20 - 25<br />       Therivai - 25-31<br />       Perilam pen - 31- to death.</p>
<p>       Mostly love happens(hero falls in love)in most of poems in Pethamai<br />   stage where the girl is no more a child and not yet an adult to understand<br />   love fully.</p>
<p>       But there are some desperate heroes who fall love with pethai girls. I<br />   recently read one Thirukkural where hero praises the beauty of a pethai<br />   girl.<br />       &#2965;&#2979; &#3021;&# 2975;&#3006; &#2992;&# 3021; &#2953;&#2991;<br />   &#3007;&# 2992;&#3021; &#2953;&#2979; &#3021;&# 2979;&#3009; &#2990;&# 3021;<br />   &#2980;&#3019; &#2993;&# 3021;&#2993; &#2980;&# 3021;&#2980; &#3006;&#<br />   2985;&#3021; , &#2986;&#3014; &#2979;&# 3021; &#2980;&#2965; &#3016;&#<br />   2986;&#3021;<br />       &#2986;&#3015; &#2980;&# 3016;&#2965; &#3021;&# 2965;&#3009; ,<br />   &#2949;&#2990; &#2992;&# 3021;&#2980; &#3021;&# 2980;&#2985; &#2965;&#2979;<br />   &#3021;.</p>
<p>       So girls fell in love around age of 10- 12.</p>
<p>       So if we take these facts into consideration, Kundhavai should have<br />   been married between 12- 14 bcos she was a princess. So She still had some<br />   time left in this deadline which had helped her find her love of life. This<br />   puts her age to around 11-14.</p>
<p>       All the heroines must be around 12-14.</p>

        <p>Aditha Karikalan was 12 when he cut off Veerapandyan's head and before that<br />may be when he was 10 or 11, he was in 'Love' with Nandhini who must be arnd<br />the same age or older than AK.</p>
<p>I guess the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  story starts off may be 8 yrears after these events (???)<br />Coz i think somewhere it is mentioned that <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym was 20 during the events of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym <br />and when he died (need to refer this again) .</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>So if this is right, Nandhini would be arnd 20, Kundhavai and little<br />younger, maybe 16 or 17.</p>
<p>Well this is my guess and this is how i imagined the age of these characters<br />while reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .</p>

<p>     Even if we consider certain food habit and customs and so an at best<br />  we can push it to 15, not earlier.</p>
<p>  I know people who have had their first kid at age of 14. Mostly my moms<br />  generation in my community got married off by the time they were 14-15. My<br />  grand mother generation probably 2 years lesser than that. These aren't<br />  child marriage. The girls would have attained their puberty by then.</p>
<p>  In book "Home life among Tamils" the author goes on to say average age of<br />  the women attaining puberty in Tamil land is around 12-14.</p>
<p>  Silapadikaram - 6th century mentions age of Kovalan Kannagi marraige age as<br />  12&amp;16<br />  Nachinarkiniyar - 10th century -says correct marraige age for womenand<br />  menare 12&amp;16. He also mentionsthat girls attain puberty by 12-13.<br />  Kasiappa Sivachariyar - 14 th century - says in his Kantha puranam that<br />  Valli was 12 whenshe fell in love with Murugan</p>
<p>  Even if it seems like a poetic exaggeration. .. rite from 1AD to 14 AD it<br />  has been quoted women fall in love as early as 12 in Literature and Girls<br />  having childeren at 14 as late as 20 th century.. gives a very high<br />  probablity that there are lot of chances that the average age gals attain<br />  puberty in the old time was around 12 and the naiveness and ignorance of<br />  gals can lead upto love(these days we call infatuation ) ..</p>
<p>  So logically these girls should been married by upper limit 14. If in 10th<br />  century norm was getting married at the age of 12 was present ,then no king<br />  would allow his daughter to cross that age and be single.<br />  Historical Kundhavai should have been married before or by 14.</p>
<p>  So this is why had given age of the heroines as 12-14. I am not very sure<br />  about Kalki imagination but if Kundhavai was married in 10th century , she<br />  would got married before she was 14!</p>

<p>    Falling in love with another human is technically impossible before<br />  hormonal maturity. Nature has made it that way.

Even if we consider certain foodhabit and customs and so an at best we can push it to 15, not earlier. If poets wrote 10-12 as the age they were just trying to engage is poetic exaggeration or somehow justify the norms of that time. </p>

<p>    Some thing you should consider here....<br />    The events take place in 10th century. <br />    Looking at literature, you will come to know that ideal age of marraigeof a girl is 12 and of a guy is 16. <br />    It is confirmed in Silapadikaram(<a href="http://karkanirka" title="http://karkanirka">http://karkanirka</a>. wordpress. com/2008/ 04/28/silapadiga ram-part- 1/) and also Nachnarkinniyar works which are around 10th century.</p>
<p>    Ages of Girls are classfied in 7 stages<br />    pethai 5-7<br />    pethumbai- 8-11<br />    Mankai - 12- 13 - where she blossoms into maiden.<br />    Matandai - 14-19<br />    Arivai - around 20 - 25<br />    Therivai - 25-31<br />    Perilam pen - 31- to death.</p>
<p>    Mostly love happens(hero falls in love)in most of poems in Pethamai stage where the girl is no more a child and not yet an adult to understand love fully.</p>
<p>    But there are some desperate heroes who fall love with pethai girls. I recently read one Thirukkural where hero praises the beauty of a pethai girl.<br />    &#2965;&#2979; &#3021;&# 2975;&#3006; &#2992;&# 3021; &#2953;&#2991; &#3007;&# 2992;&#3021; &#2953;&#2979; &#3021;&# 2979;&#3009; &#2990;&# 3021; &#2980;&#3019; &#2993;&# 3021;&#2993; &#2980;&# 3021;&#2980; &#3006;&# 2985;&#3021; , &#2986;&#3014; &#2979;&# 3021; &#2980;&#2965; &#3016;&# 2986;&#3021;     &#2986;&#3015; &#2980;&# 3016;&#2965; &#3021;&# 2965;&#3009; , &#2949;&#2990; &#2992;&# 3021;&#2980; &#3021;&# 2980;&#2985; &#2965;&#2979; &#3021;.</p>
<p>    So girls fell in love around age of 10- 12. </p>
<p>    So if we take these facts into consideration, Kundhavai should have been married between 12- 14 bcos she was a princess. So She still had some time left in this deadline which had helped her find her love of life. This puts her age to around 11-14.</p>
<p>    All the heroines must be around 12-14.</p>

        <p>VAiram, yes very well said!! There are lot of stories both real and ficitonof kids growing up together and the fondness maturing into love. My father's brother married his niece after they fell in love, he was 21 and she was18 and they had grown up together in the same house.Singer SP Bala talked of how he married same way, girl opposite house he had seen several years since young age and when they grew up they knew they were meant for each other. But among strangers this is very unlikely...</p>
<p>Yes as you say kalki has induced maturity into characters that may not havereally existed. In fact one of my relatives who was a historian once read to us about Krishnadevaraya and how his wives were treated. Every day one of the women would know it is their turn and go to his mansion. End of story, that was all their married life was about - my uncle said almost all kings were like that, there was no eloquent dialoging or discussions with womeninvolved. </p>
<p>Today's times are different, even very different than ours considering the media exposure children have. Teachers complaining of 'romance' before 6th grade...ought to talk to school/parents of healthy sex education and teaching children of what is appropriate at what age. Assumign all these issues will just go away or taking their crushes seriously is dangerous to say the least.</p>

<p>  Got messed up some where down the line. My estimate was 12-14 (considering puberty by 12 - good two years to develop love and 14 being upper limit for marriage deadline!)</p>
<p>  10-12 was hero falling in love with the girl in Sangam poems. These girlsshow some physical characteristics of a women but still not yet women..butheroes fall for the girls...</p>
<p>  This I found bit awkward to accept...but I came across similar story linein "One hundred years of Solitude" where Colonel Aureliano Buend?a fallsin love with a girl. His parents talk with the gals parents for marriage, then only they come to know that the girl hasn't yet attained puberty. So this guy waits till she attains puberty and then marries her. This story is set in mid 19th -20 th century in Mexico. So guy falling in love with gal who is yet to become a women seems to have been happening all over the world!!!</p>
<p>  Another thought... recent movie pasanga ...looks like the kids actually move out like lovers and the villan kid envying them... considering they arein only 5th-6th std kids (10-12 years old).. though we can term them as kid love(surely not hormone driven) there seems to be a liking involved. Transporting this to very early time...there were no schools or even avenues where boys and girls can meet.... So when the girl meets a guy for first timeaccidentally (as iyarkai punarchi situations)when she has attained the ageof developing the kiddish love and coupling with Tamil cinematic sentiments the love comes only once , you should live with him or die for him(even in ps Manimekalai )....we can expect early age of a gal falling in love(butthis love is technically not the scientific hormone driven love - probablymore of a liking - infatuation).</p>
<p>  Logically and historical point of view the girls in tenth century were inposition to fall in love anywhere between 12-14 and would have been married by 14.</p>
<p>  This is my perspective. But the maturity in Kundhavai, Nandhini ,and all these people makes me feel they must have been atleast 16-18 if not more. This probably because of looking into history from current prespective.Probably Kalki wrote the characters with more mature mind like that of 20 th century girls who are in age of marriage.But girls in marriage age in 10th century were very young age!</p>

<p>    Lots of information Vairam!! I was talking of the hormone driven process of falling in love which is different from marraige and even having kids.My paternal grand mother was married at 8 and sent to husband's house at 13. She conceived first time at 14 much to the ire of the british doctors who treated her. Her daughter was married off at 12 and conceived at 13. </p>
<p>    These things are not related to falling in love. A natural hormone driven process of being attracted to another person is logically after puberty with the right situation. Nowadays it is 16, perhaps considering age norms 14 is acceptable for 10th century. 10-12 seems very tough to accept.</p>

<p>      I know people who have had their first kid at age of 14. Mostly my moms generation in my community got married off by the time they were 14-15. My grand mother generation probably 2 years lesser than that. These aren't child marriage. The girls would have attained their puberty by then.</p>
<p>      In book "Home life among Tamils" the author goes on to say average age of the women attaining puberty in Tamil land is around 12-14.</p>
<p>      Silapadikaram - 6th century mentions age of Kovalan Kannagi marraige age as 12&amp;16<br />      Nachinarkiniyar - 10th century -says correct marraige age for womenand menare 12&amp;16. He also mentionsthat girls attain puberty by 12-13.<br />      Kasiappa Sivachariyar - 14 th century - says in his Kantha puranam that Valli was 12 whenshe fell in love with Murugan</p>
<p>      Even if it seems like a poetic exaggeration... rite from 1AD to 14 ADit has been quoted women fall in love as early as 12 in Literature and Girls having childeren at 14 as late as 20 th century.. gives a very high probablity that there are lot of chances that the average age gals attain puberty in the old time was around 12 and the naiveness and ignorance of gals can lead upto love(these days we call infatuation ) ..</p>
<p>      So logically these girls should been married by upper limit 14. If in10th century norm was getting married at the age of 12 was present ,then no king would allow his daughter to cross that age and be single.<br />      Historical Kundhavai should have been married before or by 14. </p>
<p>      So this is why had given age of the heroines as 12-14. I am not verysure about Kalki imagination but if Kundhavai was married in 10th century , she would got married before she was 14!</p>

        <p>Hi Ganesh, 6th class love ellaam dumb stuff inspired by movies and low selfesteem...usually kids who are raised in healthy families do not 'fall in love' at that age..In fact more than half the kids you are talking are also 'in love' with Hrithik Roshan and Shahrukh Khan.</p>
<p>I want to tell you a real story - this actually hapened when I was in 7th grade myself. One of my classmates confessed to us that she was madly in love with Rajinikant who was a rising star at that time. We were alarmed and wanted to tell the teacher but before that she had taken a train to chennai with someone and actaully landed at Rajini's doorstep asking him to marry her. Rajini counselled her that he acts in movies and she should be paying attention to her studies at this age. She came back and at 10th grade her parents married her off to someone as they thought she will run away again. This is a 100% true story.</p>
<p>Falling in love atleast as depicted by Kalki looks like a conscious mature attraction experienced by the people involved. Not childish crushes that come and go.</p>

<p>  Nanum summa irundhiralamnnu paartha vida mateengreengale :)). I guess youhave little outdated hormone theory !!! People could very fall in love from age of 11-12. That is today's seventh std. My friend who runs a school says that even at 6th std the romance issue starts. U may that is infatuationbut in those days it may have become a step to love &amp; marriage by the merefact that the society was accepting marriages around that age. So AK with nandhini or Sivakami -NVP could have very well fallen in love. </p>
<p>  In today's context the marriage age has move to 20+ and so you find love only from college as an understandable process. But just rewind yourself tour grandparents' time and if someone had approached their parents that they have fallen in love and want to get married, I guess they would not have felt any major uproar (subject to their luv being from the same sect etc..)Infact kadhu kadhum vachha madhiri kalyanatha close panniiruppaargal. </p>
<p>  But now in our times, if a 6th std student goes and says to his parents that he is love with maadi veettu kundavai, serruppu pingirum. </p>

<p>  ACtually Venkat i think all romances in PS are opportunistic. Manimekali,oru thalai kaadal/infatuation. Brother's friend, guy she saw since she wasa kid..very believable.</p>
<p>  AMV would not have dared to 'marry' Poonguzhali or even declare his romance to her. He was too scared of his sister. Ther is nothing said about Poonguzhali's ambition related to her marraige to Sendhan Amudhan..more believeable, she found out falling in love with kings and princes is not going to work out for a simple country girl and settled for another similar guy.</p>
<p>  Kundavi and VD we know of course. VD wanted rich influential woman and she wanted to keep her life.</p>
<p>  In all PS is not inspiring in terms of love :))</p>

<blockquote><p>  considering age norms 14 is acceptable for 10th century. 10-12 seems verytough to accept.</p></blockquote>
<p>Got messed up some where down the line. My estimate was 12-14 (considering puberty by 12 - good two years to develop love and 14 being upper limit formarriage deadline!)</p>
<p>10-12 was hero falling in love with the girl in Sangam poems. These girls show some physical characteristics of a women but still not yet women..but heroes fall for the girls...</p>
<p>This I found <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  awkward to accept...but I came across similar story line in "One hundred years of Solitude" where Colonel Aureliano Buend?a falls in love with a girl. His parents talk with the gals parents for marriage, then only they come to know that the girl hasn't yet attained puberty. So this guy waits till she attains puberty and then marries her. This story is set in mid 19th -20 th century in Mexico. So guy falling in love with gal whois yet to become a women seems to have been happening all over the world!!!</p>
<p>Another thought... recent movie pasanga ...looks like the kids actually move out like lovers and the villan kid envying them... considering they are in only 5th-6th std kids (10-12 years old).. though we can term them as kid love(surely not hormone driven) there seems to be a liking involved. Transporting this to very early time...there were no schools or even avenues where boys and girls can meet.... So when the girl meets a guy for first time accidentally (as iyarkai punarchi situations)when she has attained the age of developing the kiddish love and coupling with Tamil cinematic sentimentsthe love comes only once , you should live with him or die for him(even inps Manimekalai )....we can expect early age of a gal falling in love(but this love is technically not the scientific hormone driven love - probably more of a liking - infatuation).</p>
<p>Logically and historical point of view the girls in tenth century were in position to fall in love anywhere between 12-14 and would have been married by 14.</p>
<p>This is my perspective. But the maturity in Kundhavai, Nandhini ,and all these people makes me feel they must have been atleast 16-18 if not more. This probably because of looking into history from current prespective.Probably Kalki wrote the characters with more mature mind like that of 20 th century girls who are in age of marriage.But girls in marriage age in 10th century were very young age!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Lots of information Vairam!! I was talking of the hormone driven process of falling in love which is different from marraige and even having kids. My paternal grand mother was married at 8 and sent to husband's house at 13.She conceived first time at 14 much to the ire of the british doctors who treated her. Her daughter was married off at 12 and conceived at 13. </p>
<p>  These things are not related to falling in love. A natural hormone drivenprocess of being attracted to another person is logically after puberty with the right situation. Nowadays it is 16, perhaps considering age norms 14is acceptable for 10th century. 10-12 seems very tough to accept.</p>

<p>    I know people who have had their first kid at age of 14. Mostly my momsgeneration in my community got married off by the time they were 14-15. Mygrand mother generation probably 2 years lesser than that. These aren't child marriage. The girls would have attained their puberty by then.</p>
<p>    In book "Home life among Tamils" the author goes on to say average age of the women attaining puberty in Tamil land is around 12-14.</p>
<p>    Silapadikaram - 6th century mentions age of Kovalan Kannagi marraige age as 12&amp;16<br />    Nachinarkiniyar - 10th century -says correct marraige age for womenand menare 12&amp;16. He also mentionsthat girls attain puberty by 12-13.<br />    Kasiappa Sivachariyar - 14 th century - says in his Kantha puranam thatValli was 12 whenshe fell in love with Murugan</p>
<p>    Even if it seems like a poetic exaggeration... rite from 1AD to 14 AD it has been quoted women fall in love as early as 12 in Literature and Girlshaving childeren at 14 as late as 20 th century.. gives a very high probablity that there are lot of chances that the average age gals attain pubertyin the old time was around 12 and the naiveness and ignorance of gals can lead upto love(these days we call infatuation ) ..</p>
<p>    So logically these girls should been married by upper limit 14. If in 10th century norm was getting married at the age of 12 was present ,then no king would allow his daughter to cross that age and be single.<br />    Historical Kundhavai should have been married before or by 14. </p>
<p>    So this is why had given age of the heroines as 12-14. I am not very sure about Kalki imagination but if Kundhavai was married in 10th century , she would got married before she was 14!</p>

<p>      Falling in love with another human is technically impossible before hormonal maturity. Nature has made it that way. Even if we consider certain food habit and customs and so an at best we can push it to 15, not earlier.If poets wrote 10-12 as the age they were just trying to engage is poetic exaggeration or somehow justify the norms of that time. </p>

<p>        Some thing you should consider here....<br />        The events take place in 10th century. <br />        Looking at literature, you will come to know that ideal age of marraige of a girl is 12 and of a guy is 16. <br />        It is confirmed in Silapadikaram(<a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/silapadigaram-part-1/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/silapadigaram-part-1/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/silapadigaram-part-1/</a>) and also Nachnarkinniyar works which are around 10th century.</p>
<p>        Ages of Girls are classfied in 7 stages<br />        pethai 5-7<br />        pethumbai- 8-11<br />        Mankai - 12- 13 - where she blossoms into maiden.<br />        Matandai - 14-19<br />        Arivai - around 20 - 25<br />        Therivai - 25-31<br />        Perilam pen - 31- to death.</p>
<p>        Mostly love happens(hero falls in love)in most of poems in Pethamaistage where the girl is no more a child and not yet an adult to understandlove fully.</p>
<p>        But there are some desperate heroes who fall love with pethai girls. I recently read one Thirukkural where hero praises the beauty of a pethaigirl.<br />        &#2965;&#2979;&#3021;&#2975;&#3006;&#2992;&#3021; &#2953;&#2991;&#3007;&#2992;&#3021; &#2953;&#2979;&#3021;&#2979;&#3009;&#2990;&#3021; &#2980;&#3019;&#2993;&#3021;&#2993;&#2980;&#3021;&#2980;&#3006;&#2985;&#3021;, &#2986;&#3014;&#2979;&#3021; &#2980;&#2965;&#3016;&#2986;&#3021;         &#2986;&#3015;&#2980;&#3016;&#2965;&#3021;&#2965;&#3009;, &#2949;&#2990;&#2992;&#3021;&#2980;&#3021;&#2980;&#2985; &#2965;&#2979;&#3021;.</p>
<p>        So girls fell in love around age of 10- 12. </p>
<p>        So if we take these facts into consideration, Kundhavai should havebeen married between 12- 14 bcos she was a princess. So She still had sometime left in this deadline which had helped her find her love of life. This puts her age to around 11-14.</p>
<p>        All the heroines must be around 12-14.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi</p>
<p>Nanum summa irundhiralamnnu paartha vida mateengreengale :)). I guess you have little outdated hormone theory !!! People could very fall in love from age of 11-12. That is today's seventh std. My friend who runs a school says that even at 6th std the romance issue starts. U may that is infatuation but in those days it may have become a step to love &amp; marriage by the mere fact that the society was accepting marriages around that age. So <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym with nandhini or Sivakami -NVP could have very well fallen in love. </p>
<p>In today's context the marriage age has move to 20+ and so you find love only from college as an understandable process. But just rewind yourself to ur grandparents' time and if someone had approached their parents that they have fallen in love and want to get married, I guess they would not have felt any major uproar (subject to their luv being from the same sect etc..) Infact kadhu kadhum vachha madhiri kalyanatha close panniiruppaargal. </p>
<p>But now in our times, if a 6th std student goes and says to his parents that he is love with maadi veettu kundavai, serruppu pingirum. </p>

        <p>ACtually Venkat i think all romances in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  are opportunistic. Manimekali, oru thalai kaadal/infatuation. Brother's friend, guy she saw since she was akid..very believable.</p>
<p>AMV would not have dared to 'marry' Poonguzhali or even declare his romanceto her. He was too scared of his sister. Ther is nothing said about Poonguzhali's ambition related to her marraige to Sendhan Amudhan..more believeable, she found out falling in love with kings and princes is not going to work out for a simple country girl and settled for another similar guy.</p>
<p>Kundavi and <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  we know of course. <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  wanted rich influential woman and she wanted to keep her life.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Lots of information Vairam!! I was talking of the hormone driven process offalling in love which is different from marraige and even having kids. My paternal grand mother was married at 8 and sent to husband's house at 13. She conceived first time at 14 much to the ire of the british doctors who treated her. Her daughter was married off at 12 and conceived at 13. </p>
<p>These things are not related to falling in love. A natural hormone driven process of being attracted to another person is logically after puberty withthe right situation. Nowadays it is 16, perhaps considering age norms 14 is acceptable for 10th century. 10-12 seems very tough to accept.</p>
<p>M</p>

<blockquote><p>     Even if we consider certain food habit and customs and so an at best we can push it to 15, not earlier.</p>
<p>  I know people who have had their first kid at age of 14. Mostly my moms generation in my community got married off by the time they were 14-15. My grand mother generation probably 2 years lesser than that. These aren't child marriage. The girls would have attained their puberty by then.</p>
<p>  In book "Home life among Tamils" the author goes on to say average age ofthe women attaining puberty in Tamil land is around 12-14.</p>
<p>  Silapadikaram - 6th century mentions age of Kovalan Kannagi marraige age as 12&amp;16<br />  Nachinarkiniyar - 10th century -says correct marraige age for womenand menare 12&amp;16. He also mentionsthat girls attain puberty by 12-13.<br />  Kasiappa Sivachariyar - 14 th century - says in his Kantha puranam that Valli was 12 whenshe fell in love with Murugan</p>
<p>  Even if it seems like a poetic exaggeration... rite from 1AD to 14 AD it has been quoted women fall in love as early as 12 in Literature and Girls having childeren at 14 as late as 20 th century.. gives a very high probablity that there are lot of chances that the average age gals attain puberty in the old time was around 12 and the naiveness and ignorance of gals can lead upto love(these days we call infatuation ) ..</p>
<p>  So logically these girls should been married by upper limit 14. If in 10th century norm was getting married at the age of 12 was present ,then no king would allow his daughter to cross that age and be single.<br />  Historical Kundhavai should have been married before or by 14. </p>
<p>  So this is why had given age of the heroines as 12-14. I am not very sure about Kalki imagination but if Kundhavai was married in 10th century , she would got married before she was 14!</p>

<p>    Falling in love with another human is technically impossible before hormonal maturity. Nature has made it that way. Even if we consider certain food habit and customs and so an at best we can push it to 15, not earlier. If poets wrote 10-12 as the age they were just trying to engage is poetic exaggeration or somehow justify the norms of that time. </p>

<p>      Some thing you should consider here....<br />      The events take place in 10th century. <br />      Looking at literature, you will come to know that ideal age of marraige of a girl is 12 and of a guy is 16. <br />      It is confirmed in Silapadikaram(<a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/silapadigaram-part-1/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/silapadigaram-part-1/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/silapadigaram-part-1/</a>) and also Nachnarkinniyar works which are around 10th century.</p>
<p>      Ages of Girls are classfied in 7 stages<br />      pethai 5-7<br />      pethumbai- 8-11<br />      Mankai - 12- 13 - where she blossoms into maiden.<br />      Matandai - 14-19<br />      Arivai - around 20 - 25<br />      Therivai - 25-31<br />      Perilam pen - 31- to death.</p>
<p>      Mostly love happens(hero falls in love)in most of poems in Pethamai stage where the girl is no more a child and not yet an adult to understand love fully.</p>
<p>      But there are some desperate heroes who fall love with pethai girls. I recently read one Thirukkural where hero praises the beauty of a pethai girl.<br />      &#2965;&#2979;&#3021;&#2975;&#3006;&#2992;&#3021; &#2953;&#2991;&#3007;&#2992;&#3021; &#2953;&#2979;&#3021;&#2979;&#3009;&#2990;&#3021; &#2980;&#3019;&#2993;&#3021;&#2993;&#2980;&#3021;&#2980;&#3006;&#2985;&#3021;, &#2986;&#3014;&#2979;&#3021; &#2980;&#2965;&#3016;&#2986;&#3021;       &#2986;&#3015;&#2980;&#3016;&#2965;&#3021;&#2965;&#3009;, &#2949;&#2990;&#2992;&#3021;&#2980;&#3021;&#2980;&#2985; &#2965;&#2979;&#3021;.</p>
<p>      So girls fell in love around age of 10- 12. </p>
<p>      So if we take these facts into consideration, Kundhavai should have been married between 12- 14 bcos she was a princess. So She still had some time left in this deadline which had helped her find her love of life. This puts her age to around 11-14.</p>
<p>      All the heroines must be around 12-14.</p>

        <p>Vairam, marriage is different from falling in love. Even my grandparents and their parents married around ages 8-12. My paternal grandmotehr was 7.5 years while she was 'married'.</p>
<p>Falling in love with another human is technically impossible before hormonal maturity. Nature has made it that way. Even if we consider certain food habit and customs and so an at best we can push it to 15, not earlier. If poets wrote 10-12 as the age they were just trying to engage is poetic exaggeration or somehow justify the norms of that time. </p>

<p>  Ages of Girls are classfied in 7 stages<br />  pethai 5-7<br />  pethumbai- 8-11<br />  Mankai - 12- 13 - where she blossoms into maiden.<br />  Matandai - 14-19<br />  Arivai - around 20 - 25<br />  Therivai - 25-31<br />  Perilam pen - 31- to death.</p>
<p>  Mostly love happens(hero falls in love)in most of poems in Pethamai stagewhere the girl is no more a child and not yet an adult to understand love fully.</p>
<p>  But there are some desperate heroes who fall love with pethai girls. I recently read one Thirukkural where hero praises the beauty of a pethai girl.<br />  &#2965;&#2979;&#3021;&#2975;&#3006;&#2992;&#3021; &#2953;&#2991;&#3007;&#2992;&#3021; &#2953;&#2979;&#3021;&#2979;&#3009;&#2990;&#3021; &#2980;&#3019;&#2993;&#3021;&#2993;&#2980;&#3021;&#2980;&#3006;&#2985;&#3021;, &#2986;&#3014;&#2979;&#3021; &#2980;&#2965;&#3016;&#2986;&#3021;   &#2986;&#3015;&#2980;&#3016;&#2965;&#3021;&#2965;&#3009;, &#2949;&#2990;&#2992;&#3021;&#2980;&#3021;&#2980;&#2985; &#2965;&#2979;&#3021;.</p>
<p>  So girls fell in love around age of 10- 12. </p>
<p>  So if we take these facts into consideration, Kundhavai should have been married between 12- 14 bcos she was a princess. So She still had some time left in this deadline which had helped her find her love of life. This putsher age to around 11-14.</p>
<p>  All the heroines must be around 12-14.</p>

        <p>Actually we had a long thread on this sometime ago...with Dr Sri pitching in to say hormone development that causes people to fall in love has been more or less similar over time.</p>
<p>The surest way to ascertain age for older stories is that...16 years for falling in love. Probably by early twenties married and kids. Women usually died of some form of illness by 50s. So 'elderly' woman such as Sembian Madevi is probably in her 40s. Don't have to look as far as <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  our own grandparents or great grand parents will serve as examples.</p>
