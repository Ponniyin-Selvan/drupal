</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Fellas<br />I have read from the beginning of this topic. It starts <br />with 'Nenju Porukudhillaye'. The second member says that he has done <br />something to stop this propoganda. Afterwards the discussion goes to <br />Hinduism, Mahabharatha and its characters, stories, quiz etc. <br />No ideas were presented to condemn the propoganda made by the <br />evangalists. We can bring this to media's light, or inform HR and CE <br />Board that these are harming the feelings of Hindus. We can take this <br />magazines and inform people to be careful. If possible, this can be <br />taken to Human Rights Court, I believe.<br />Just making arguments and discussing Mahabharata wont stop them.<br />That too only 5 or 6 members opinions repeats again and again. This <br />group is said to have more than 1500 members !</p>
<p>This is my opinion, whether it is agreed or not. But I have a <br />strong faith in Hinduism. It cannot be destroyed easily.</p>

        <p>Dear friends</p>
<p>As Madhu, Venkat pointed out, by keeping quiet, we are becoming <br />silent witnesses to the slander/retread on Hindu values by these <br />Missionaries.Trying to rope in the so called "intellectual crowd" and <br />attacking History scientifically with made up proofs.Nijamaagave <br />Nenju porukkudhillaye.Roudhram Pazgha vendiya neram idhu..</p>
<p>But there is some respite from Mr.JayaMohan's portal on this-<br /><a href="http://jeyamohan.in/?p=600" title="http://jeyamohan.in/?p=600">http://jeyamohan.in/?p=600</a></p>
<p>This anguish is not something new to Hindus.Remember Vivekananda's <br />cry in Chicago ""if we Hindus dig out all the dirt from the bottom of <br />the Pacific Ocean and throw it in you faces, it will be but a speck <br />compared to what the missionaries have done to our religion and <br />culture". </p>
<p>Atleast glad, that our voice is being heard loud and clear these days.</p>

<p>  Dear Mr. Ravi,</p>
<p>  While I understand the noble thoughts behind your message to ignore <br />  such barking dogs, I want to look at it from another perspective.</p>
<p>  It is not just an article - it is the information about a concerted <br />  attempt by the Missionaries to rope in the so-called intellectuals, <br />  liberals and eminent persons and get them endorse their idea <br />  of "Thomas-Tamil Religion". The impacts can be significant - <br />imagine <br />  such a thesis being made part of the University syllabus in <br />subjects <br />  like Religion, Culture, Language - or worse History.</p>
<p>  As it is we are commenting on the incorrect history of our country <br />  being taught in the Govt. approved syllabi. If such a fundamental <br />  falsehood creeps into the syllabus, the effects will be dangerous.</p>
<p>  Though we could not have discussed much about this in our group - <br />  because most of us agree that this is nonsense and so there are not <br />  too many things to debate or discuss - I feel we should not dismiss <br />  this as a "mindless remark". It is much more than just a remark.</p>
<p>  Many times, such forces take advantage of the non-existence of <br />  logical and intellectual opposition to their filthy arguments. Most <br />  of the people who do counter-argument tend to get emotional and <br />that <br />  hands over the battle in a platter to these subversive elements.</p>
<p>  My humple opinion of strong feelings.</p>
<p>  Thanks...... ..... <br />  V</p>

<p>    Hi</p>
<p>    I thought we had concluded that the article was nothing but a <br />    worthless piece of essay articulated by an ignorant mind.</p>
<p>    I think many in this group may have felt its not worth to pursue <br />    mindless remarks.</p>
<p>    yemara aal iruntha yematha thaan thonum, instead of fighting the <br />    writer or mag, if there need be a cure, lets start with a fix on <br />  the <br />    issues inside our following and educate our younger generation on <br />  how <br />    to be honest and how to stand in line with dharma.</p>

<p>      Yes, indeed the topic is diverted. In fact even SPS sir asked <br />to <br />      changed the subject line to suitably reflect the topic being <br />      discussed. Thanks for the reminder.</p>
<p>      But I would like to say something about the discussions.</p>
<p>      1. Your opinion is absolutely valued. I am a member of various <br />      groups. But I have seen that this groups is much ahead in <br />    respecting <br />      everyone's opinions, though there can be disagreements. That <br />    doesn't <br />      mean buying the opinion of others, though in disagreement. It <br />  just <br />      means that every one is welcome to present their views.</p>
<p>      2. It is always natural for new threads being started out of <br />the <br />      existing one. But as our SPS sir indicated, we should have <br />  changed <br />      the Subject. We did not and sorry for that. Just that some one <br />    picks <br />      one point interesting and convenient for them and starts to <br />    discuss. <br />      Atleast the topic was changed to "Hinduism Bad Karma and Good <br />    Karma". <br />      This itself is a pointer that this slip was done unconsiously <br />    though <br />      reminders were there to correct the course. </p>
<p>      All,<br />      Let us take this as a constructive- criticism and correct our <br />      mistakes. </p>
<p>      Madhu,<br />      We are thankful to you for bringing this to notice.</p>
<p>      3. Regarding the participation of other members out of a <br />  strength <br />    of <br />      more than 1500, nothing can be done about the non-participants. <br />    There <br />      could be many reasons for non-participation, starting from <br />  Shyness <br />    to <br />      Ignorance to many other reason. We can only say that the group <br />  does <br />      not restrict any one from participating, as long as the decorum <br />  is <br />      maintained. Disagreements to any degree are allowed to be <br />voiced <br />      here, provided the aesthetics are maintained, without any foul <br />      language and name calling. Just for an example, I find that you <br />    have <br />      participated for the first time now. If you are a member for <br />  long <br />      time here, you have broken the nutshell or if you are a new <br />    entrant, <br />      then you are bang right on. Let us respect others for what they <br />    are. <br />      But there is always a time when others will come out in the <br />open <br />    and <br />      contribute. Until then unfortunately it will be only those 4 or <br />  5 <br />      repeating persons who will contribute. I, myself, was a silent <br />      spectator for atleast 4 to 6 months before I felt comfortable <br />to <br />    join <br />      the discussions. </p>
<p>      4. Within those few people who contribute frequently, there are <br />    well <br />      learned people. I really mean it. I dont want to specifically <br />  start <br />      naming them for the fear of missing out somebody. There are <br />      distinguished media persons to well known archaeologist, to <br />  great <br />      writers, to very young archeological amateurs, to wonderful <br />  people <br />      who have done great researches on the Tamizh language and many <br />    more. <br />      Naturally there can be fear for some to come out in the open to <br />      contribute, if they had known the background of the persons in <br />  this <br />      group. </p>
<p>      So please remember that all are welcome to contribute and as <br />  said <br />      earlier, there are no restrictions on anyone, except when they <br />  use <br />      foul language.</p>
<p>      Just thought I will share my views here. Please do not take it <br />      offensively. If my words have hurt you, I sincerely apologize <br />in <br />      advance for the same.</p>

<p>  Though we could not have discussed much about this in our group - <br />  because most of us agree that this is nonsense and so there are not <br />  too many things to debate or discuss - I feel we should not <br />dismiss  <br />  this as a "mindless remark". It is much more than just a remark.</p>
<p>  Many times, such forces take advantage of the non-existence of <br />  logical and intellectual opposition to their filthy arguments.

        <p>Hi,<br />The problem here is the books and the content have been getting the official sanction of the parties in power, both at the centre and at the state. You will definitely find such a mention creeping into the textbooks with in another 3 years. The only party that can stop this nonsense, will in turn put forward another nonsense which will be biased on the other end of the spectrum.<br />Vijay had given the link to the comment of the syrian christian forum, it clearly showcases what every community will do. Create an imaginary link to an episode in myth/legend/history/epic/book and believe it to be the truth, even though there might be no way to prove or disprove it. This is indeed true for all communities, including us. <br />Why not petition the government and the chief minister not to provide any kind of sanction to such a lie, thereby keeping the sanctity of the government to provide only governance and not to act on behalf of any specific religious body as such? Also, a better way would be inform rajini or kamal or any actors that would be involved in the project in question to stay away bygiving them clear reasons and information, as to possible effect and outcome of their involvement.<br />Regards ,<br />Nanda</p>

<p>    Dear Madhu,</p>
<p>    Yes, indeed the topic is diverted. In fact even SPS sir asked to <br />    changed the subject line to suitably reflect the topic being <br />    discussed. Thanks for the reminder.</p>
<p>    But I would like to say something about the discussions.</p>
<p>    1. Your opinion is absolutely valued. I am a member of various <br />    groups. But I have seen that this groups is much ahead in <br />  respecting <br />    everyone's opinions, though there can be disagreements. That <br />  doesn't <br />    mean buying the opinion of others, though in disagreement. It <br />just <br />    means that every one is welcome to present their views.</p>
<p>    2. It is always natural for new threads being started out of the <br />    existing one. But as our SPS sir indicated, we should have <br />changed <br />    the Subject. We did not and sorry for that. Just that some one <br />  picks <br />    one point interesting and convenient for them and starts to <br />  discuss. <br />    Atleast the topic was changed to "Hinduism Bad Karma and Good <br />  Karma". <br />    This itself is a pointer that this slip was done unconsiously <br />  though <br />    reminders were there to correct the course. </p>
<p>    All,<br />    Let us take this as a constructive- criticism and correct our <br />    mistakes. </p>
<p>    Madhu,<br />    We are thankful to you for bringing this to notice.</p>
<p>    3. Regarding the participation of other members out of a <br />strength <br />  of <br />    more than 1500, nothing can be done about the non-participants. <br />  There <br />    could be many reasons for non-participation, starting from <br />Shyness <br />  to <br />    Ignorance to many other reason. We can only say that the group <br />does <br />    not restrict any one from participating, as long as the decorum <br />is <br />    maintained. Disagreements to any degree are allowed to be voiced <br />    here, provided the aesthetics are maintained, without any foul <br />    language and name calling. Just for an example, I find that you <br />  have <br />    participated for the first time now. If you are a member for <br />long <br />    time here, you have broken the nutshell or if you are a new <br />  entrant, <br />    then you are bang right on. Let us respect others for what they <br />  are. <br />    But there is always a time when others will come out in the open <br />  and <br />    contribute. Until then unfortunately it will be only those 4 or <br />5 <br />    repeating persons who will contribute. I, myself, was a silent <br />    spectator for atleast 4 to 6 months before I felt comfortable to <br />  join <br />    the discussions. </p>
<p>    4. Within those few people who contribute frequently, there are <br />  well <br />    learned people. I really mean it. I dont want to specifically <br />start <br />    naming them for the fear of missing out somebody. There are <br />    distinguished media persons to well known archaeologist, to <br />great <br />    writers, to very young archeological amateurs, to wonderful <br />people <br />    who have done great researches on the Tamizh language and many <br />  more. <br />    Naturally there can be fear for some to come out in the open to <br />    contribute, if they had known the background of the persons in <br />this <br />    group. </p>
<p>    So please remember that all are welcome to contribute and as <br />said <br />    earlier, there are no restrictions on anyone, except when they <br />use <br />    foul language.</p>
<p>    Just thought I will share my views here. Please do not take it <br />    offensively. If my words have hurt you, I sincerely apologize in <br />    advance for the same.</p>

        <p>Dear Mr. Ravi,</p>
<p>While I understand the noble thoughts behind your message to ignore <br />such barking dogs, I want to look at it from another perspective.</p>
<p>It is not just an article - it is the information about a concerted <br />attempt by the Missionaries to rope in the so-called intellectuals, <br />liberals and eminent persons and get them endorse their idea <br />of "Thomas-Tamil Religion". The impacts can be significant - imagine <br />such a thesis being made part of the University syllabus in subjects <br />like Religion, Culture, Language - or worse History.</p>

        <p>Ravi, 100% right, yes that is true. Just a personal experience - I live in Kentucky, evangelist heartland. I have met many,many people like the authorof this article, some even worse. Between hindu,buddhist and other minority faiths we have tried many strategies to deal with them - all of us are ofthe same unilateral conclusion, arguing with an idiot makes you an idiot. The fact that they are a bunch of idiots is demonstrated more often than not by President Bush himself who is a born again Christian and author of many memory idiotic quotes.<br />?<br />It is a spiritua lesson, more than anything else. Why am I behaving like a 'Kurai kudam' and 'koothadifying' (forgive tanglish) instead of being one with who and what I believe in?<br />Of course realizing the fact that there are some violent and tough elementsof this problem to deal with.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I thought we had concluded that the article was nothing but a <br />worthless piece of essay articulated by an ignorant mind.</p>
<p>I think many in this group may have felt its not worth to pursue <br />mindless remarks.</p>

<p>  Yes, indeed the topic is diverted. In fact even SPS sir asked to <br />  changed the subject line to suitably reflect the topic being <br />  discussed. Thanks for the reminder.</p>
<p>  But I would like to say something about the discussions.</p>
<p>  1. Your opinion is absolutely valued. I am a member of various <br />  groups. But I have seen that this groups is much ahead in <br />respecting <br />  everyone's opinions, though there can be disagreements. That <br />doesn't <br />  mean buying the opinion of others, though in disagreement. It just <br />  means that every one is welcome to present their views.</p>
<p>  2. It is always natural for new threads being started out of the <br />  existing one. But as our SPS sir indicated, we should have changed <br />  the Subject. We did not and sorry for that. Just that some one <br />picks <br />  one point interesting and convenient for them and starts to <br />discuss. <br />  Atleast the topic was changed to "Hinduism Bad Karma and Good <br />Karma". <br />  This itself is a pointer that this slip was done unconsiously <br />though <br />  reminders were there to correct the course. </p>
<p>  All,<br />  Let us take this as a constructive- criticism and correct our <br />  mistakes. </p>
<p>  Madhu,<br />  We are thankful to you for bringing this to notice.</p>
<p>  3. Regarding the participation of other members out of a strength <br />of <br />  more than 1500, nothing can be done about the non-participants. <br />There <br />  could be many reasons for non-participation, starting from Shyness <br />to <br />  Ignorance to many other reason. We can only say that the group does <br />  not restrict any one from participating, as long as the decorum is <br />  maintained. Disagreements to any degree are allowed to be voiced <br />  here, provided the aesthetics are maintained, without any foul <br />  language and name calling. Just for an example, I find that you <br />have <br />  participated for the first time now. If you are a member for long <br />  time here, you have broken the nutshell or if you are a new <br />entrant, <br />  then you are bang right on. Let us respect others for what they <br />are. <br />  But there is always a time when others will come out in the open <br />and <br />  contribute. Until then unfortunately it will be only those 4 or 5 <br />  repeating persons who will contribute. I, myself, was a silent <br />  spectator for atleast 4 to 6 months before I felt comfortable to <br />join <br />  the discussions. </p>
<p>  4. Within those few people who contribute frequently, there are <br />well <br />  learned people. I really mean it. I dont want to specifically start <br />  naming them for the fear of missing out somebody. There are <br />  distinguished media persons to well known archaeologist, to great <br />  writers, to very young archeological amateurs, to wonderful people <br />  who have done great researches on the Tamizh language and many <br />more. <br />  Naturally there can be fear for some to come out in the open to <br />  contribute, if they had known the background of the persons in this <br />  group. </p>
<p>  So please remember that all are welcome to contribute and as said <br />  earlier, there are no restrictions on anyone, except when they use <br />  foul language.</p>
<p>  Just thought I will share my views here. Please do not take it <br />  offensively. If my words have hurt you, I sincerely apologize in <br />  advance for the same.</p>
