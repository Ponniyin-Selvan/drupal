        <p>SPS Sir,</p>
<p>My two cents worth</p>
<p>=========================Quote============================<br />I am YET to find mention of GOVINDARAJA in any of the ancient </p>
<blockquote><p>  Regligeous Text.. (yet to go through Kulasekara, tho" the quotes <br />are <br />  not mentioning of Govindaraja)..<br />=======================Unquote===========================</p></blockquote>
<p>This goes well with my assumption that both the temples could have <br />been different and merged later at the behest of the ruling King.</p>
<p>Also in your previous message you wrote about Thirumangai Azhwar <br />having sung Govindarajar in various forms and that there could have <br />been more forms in the temple. I beg to differ here. It is but the <br />nature of Azhwars to asscociate a Perumal of a Divyadesam with all <br />the Avatharas etc. All the Azhwars have sung about Thiruvarangan as <br />not only Krishna, but also as Rama, Trivikrama and many more. So <br />just because the Azhwar sings about the Krishna form or any other <br />form, necessarily does not mean there should have been more forms in <br />a temple. An exception however, is the Parthasarathy Temple in <br />ThiruvallikkENi (I hate to call this Triplicane). Thirumangai Azhwar <br />has sung all the forms in this temple with explicit references. The <br />pAsuram that I quoted for Thelliasingar in my earlier post refers to <br />Azhagiyasingar or Thelliyasingar. Like wise, explicit pAsurams were <br />sung for the main Perumal, Parthasarathy, Rama, Ranganatha and <br />Varadaraja.</p>
<p>With reference to the Kulothunga I being called as Kirumi KaNda <br />Chozhan and Ramanuja fleeing Srirangam, I did read some articles <br />yesterday. As pointed out clearly, Kulothunga I seems to have <br />contributed to the Vishnu temples a lot. That leaves one wondering <br />how could he have persecuted a Vaishnavite at the behest of Siva. <br />Considering the fact that there was no need to account for something <br />which had not occured, in the Guruparampara, P Sri Acharya, who <br />wrote an account of Ramanuja observes that, while Kulothunga I was a <br />stauch Saivite, with utmost tolerance towards all other religion and <br />was espousing the growth of Saivism, he could have been worried <br />about the prospects of Srivaishnavism, spearheading the race, under <br />the able guidance of Ramanuja and hence in order to have a check, <br />probably, could have summoned Ramanuja to his court for a debate. <br />However when KoorathAzhwan spoiled this by appearing in the King's <br />court in disguise, and also sarcastically pulling down Siva as God, <br />he was irked by the sarcasm and in a fit of rage could have ordered <br />to blind the eyes of Azhwan and Periya Nambi. </p>
<p>Now, the question may arise as to why did Ramanuja flee the place at <br />first, if the King was not so cruel. Again, probably the case was <br />misrepresented to Ramanuja about the loyaties of the King and also <br />it is recorded that Ramanuja was emotionally forced to flee by his <br />sishyas. </p>
<p>Even if the history has not recorded any kind of disease to <br />Kulothunga I during his end days, it had indeed recorded that the <br />Vishnuvardhana of Hoysalas invaded the Chola territory during the <br />end times of Kulothunga I and hence a state of chaos prevailed <br />during the time when Kulothunga I died, which is attributed as a <br />divine punishment by the Vaishnavites. </p>
<p>But the Koil Ozhugu, the temple chronicle of Srirangam, which mostly <br />goes well with history, records that, after the death of Kirumikanda <br />chozhan, his son Vikrama Chozhan who ascended the throne felt bad <br />about the deed of his father (Kulothunga I???) and had even <br />commented that "How did my dad ever think that by bringing down a <br />temple how could Srivaishnavism be killed. Afterall it <br />(Srivaishnavism) has two major pillars, by way of SriRamayana and <br />Thiruvaimozhi to protect it". Interesting part is that this is <br />recorded by some of the commentators to the Divyaprabhandhams as <br />well. More interestingly the chronology is maintained that after <br />Kulothunga I, his son Vikrama Chozha ascended the throne, which goes <br />well with History, accurately.</p>
<p>SriVaishnava Sri Krishnamachariar of Panchajanyam magazine, as <br />quoted by you in your previous discussion opines in the same way. <br />Rather I have copied him as it made more sense logically.</p>
<p>In view of the above, we could not clearly discard the happening as <br />fiction in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>P Sri Acharya, goes on further to refer to the incident of <br />Govindarajar being thrown into the sea by Kulothunga II and observes <br />that Sadasiva Bandarathar, has refuted that Kulothuga II had <br />comitted such an act, purely out of his love for the Chozha dynasty, <br />while, the contemporary court poet Ottakutthar himself has recorded <br />this incident in his ThakkayAga bharaNi, the song beautifully quoted <br />below.</p>

<p>  In the " Thillai &amp; Nataraja" by B. Natarajan, page 64, KAN Sastri <br />  mentioning the EARLIEST REFERENCE to the relative portions of the <br />  shrines Govindaraja and Nataraja is that of Manickavasagar in <br />  thirukkovaiyar (Verse 86).. </p>
<p>  AND the AUTHOR (Natarajan) considering MANICKAVASAGAR prior to <br />  Azhwars ! (In the same book remember the period stated as 6th <br />AD !!)</p>
<p>  I am YET to find mention of GOVINDARAJA in any of the ancient <br />  Regligeous Text.. (yet to go through Kulasekara, tho" the quotes <br />are <br />  not mentioning of Govindaraja)..</p>
<p>  Author Natarajan has also cited his father SR BALASUBRAMANIAN's <br />  quote in Later Chola Temples (1979, pp 50 - 51):: / extract/</p>
<p>  WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND REFUTED IDENTIFICATION OF KIRUMI KANDA <br />CHOZHAN <br />  WITH KULOTHUNGA- I AND THE BELIEF POPULAR AMONG VIASHANAVITES THAT <br />  RAMNUJA FLED TO MELKOTE IN KARNATAKA COUNTRY AS A RESULT OF BEING <br />  PERSECUTED BY THE CHOLA KING LIVING IN EXILE THERE FROM 1098 TO <br />1122.</p>

<p>  ---------------<br />  We cannot IGNORE the MENTION OF CHITRAKUDAM.</p>
<p>  Whether they are Paadagams?<br />  Bronzes?<br />  Sculptures?</p>
<p>  Who / When established in Chidambaram?</p>
<p>  Could not the King find another shrine atleast - instead of Sea - <br />to <br />  move the Deity ?</p>
<p>  If to be submerged in Sea .. then why Sea ?</p>
<p>  Then what is the Golden Narayan + horses which Malik kafur looted?</p>
<p>  we will discuss and try to find answers ...</p>

<blockquote><p>  I have a different view of this. Fine that it was recorded by <br />  Manikkavasagar. But can someone confirm if Manikkavasagar used the <br />  word "prostrate". The reason I ask this is, Logically, a person <br />who <br />  is praying or prostrating would never be in such comfortable Bhoga <br />  Sayana pose. Rather, only the person, who is so very comfortable <br />and <br />  doesn't need anything more, would be in such a pose. I am sure you <br />  would all agree to this logic. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>  Also as I am unable to read the Tamizh verses below, please <br />clarify.</p>

<p>hi, try this link or you can go to the archive site ( thiru pl help)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview.php" title="http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview.php">http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview.php</a>?<br />thiru=8&amp;Song_idField=8211&amp;padhi=11&amp;startLimit=5&amp;limitPerPage=1&amp;sortBy<br />=&amp;sortOrder=DESC</p>
<p>the reference is kidanthan - lay - the pose of vishnu is more of <br />enjoying the dance and hence completely agree with you , as even the <br />author wrote ... ithought many times before posting this verse but <br />then it is important to use this as a substantiation of the fact <br />that both the idols co existed - hence posted it - so pl understand <br />that i wasnt meant to harm anyones feelings.</p>
<p>regarding the urdva thandavam - i am not really sure of your version <br />of vishnu being brought in to judge - from even sanksrit references <br />and iconographic ( pallava times) - the dance of shiva is <br />accompanied by both vishnu and brahma playing appropriate muscial <br />instruments....the agamas of sculpture are very clear - size of the <br />main character guides the composition - so if shiva's dance is the <br />main plot - he is shown in much bigger size than kali in the same <br />freeze. bramha and vishnu occupy the outer niches....you even have <br />nandhi joining in the dance - then he moves into the composition.. <br />you have numerous such statues in kanchipuram, <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym , big temple. our <br />sculptures studied these verses and followed them to the tee. <br />unfortunately as you already pointed out, since vaishnavite temples <br />do not show this particular form, we can never see the examples from <br />that side...</acronym></p>
<p>reposting an earlier post of mine - from a book - nataraja in art <br />thought and literature by C. Sivaramamoorthy<br />As Siva commences his dance in the evening. Ratnakara imagines, in <br />the<br />loftiest terms the sun and moons as the cymbals used by the goddess <br />of<br />prosperity herself for tala and laya, the most important in the <br />nritta<br />aspect of dance. At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, with<br />the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon emerging <br />into<br />light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord's <br />musical<br />orchestra: <br />astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />samalakshyata nakalakshmih (Haravijya 19.5).</p>
<p>This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady of <br />music,<br />Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma keeping time<br />and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself is an<br />adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, there <br />is<br />an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described as<br />Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and Nali:<br />vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatah?.. vini cha panavi tali<br />nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />(Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11) tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi hyaninditah<br />(Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21) naikatanaratas svarah (Lingamahapurana <br />1,<br />65, 40). The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina provided<br />with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva delights in<br />innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very nature of the<br />svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita svaras,<br />the seven famous notes. Siva is also called Rathagita: akshayo<br />rathagitas cha (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 44). Ratha is Rathantarasama,<br />by the chant of which he is invoked. Siva's fondness for Sama is very<br />well known.</p>
<p>associated with several rishis, like Patanjali, Vyaghrapada, Agastya,<br />Durvasa, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, Sanatkumara, and others.<br />Ramabhadra Dikshita gives a graphic description of the rasied foot of<br />Siva in his bhujangatrasita mode of dance at Chidambaram. Siva's<br />performance of karanas, making up angaharas, which go along with his<br />whirling movements in forming mandalas, scatters a spray of water <br />from<br />the heavenly stream on his head, bathing and purifying, as it were,<br />the entire space around, packed with spectators. The rapid swirl of<br />his arms raises blasts, resounding in the caverns of the mountains of<br />the quarters, while the light form his raised lotus foot, creates a<br />halo of light around him, fully observed only by the side-long <br />glances<br />of Devi, whose dark eyes are twins it would seem of the blue lotus. <br />As<br />Siva dances with the universe as his theme, he almost lets fall the<br />curtain of illusion, mystifying like Sambara's when soon he reveals<br />the truth to Patanjali, Vyaghrapada and the other rishis, 'This is <br />the<br />illusion of the world as you see it here, and you will now know the<br />eternal truth of the Supreme Brahman, immanent, beginningless,<br />eternal, sentient and blissful, unending and monistic:<br />mandalabhramishu kirnajahnavisikarasnapitachakravalakam<br />bahuvegapavanavapuritakrandadantaradigadrikandaram<br />uddhritaikacharanambujaprabhasrij ?yamanapariveshavigraham<br />utpalodarasahodarambikalochanantavalanaikagocharam sambariyavanikam<br />athakshipan saprapanchamayanartanam sivah drag adarsayata gonikasutam<br />vyaghrapadam itaran rishin api tena te svayam idam jagan mrisha <br />janate<br />sma paramarthatah punah brahma tat param Anadi <br />sachchidanandalakshanam<br />anantam advayam (Patanjalicharita 4. 70-73).</p>
<p>Like a musician, who, during his song, stops for a while, and draws<br />attention to the tala or the rhythm beat, Siva the great dancer,<br />pauses for a while, to sound the drum himself in between, to show the<br />correct adjustment when necessary. Kshemendra describes the patting <br />of<br />the universal lotus by Siva by a play on the world Pushkara, to<br />suggest his beat of the drum tala. The concept is so lofty it makes<br />even mountain meru only a small part of the universal lotus.<br />Sportively the hand of the Lord of Pramathas (Siva) pats the <br />universal<br />lotus, thus signifying the proper musical time beat, the lotus which<br />has the golden Menu mountain as its seed vessel, the twinkling stars<br />as the pollen filaments, the dark moving clouds, the resounding bees,<br />and the vast horizon, the lotus leaves: suvamagirikarnake<br />taralatarakakesare chalajjaladashatpade sphutadigantapatrastrite sa<br />vahpramathanayakah pradisatu sriyarm yatkarah karoti jagadambuje<br />chalitatalalilayitam (Brihatkathamanjari, p. 215, 1).</p>

        <p>dear sps sir,</p>
<p>Was not clear of your prev post, trying understand what you <br />meant...pl correct me if i am wrong.</p>
<p>1. thillai had both nataraja and reclining vishnu idols - evident <br />from the hymns<br />2. the reclining pose of the vishnu idol is also sung.<br />3. is this idol made of bronze - as of now hv seen seated or <br />standing vishnu bonzes only. also mulavar always made of stone. so <br />in all probability the reclining idol is a stone idol and as is seen <br />in most simiarly dated temples, the sayana idols are massive stone <br />sculptures.<br />4. similar logic, mulavar in stone - follows that the utsavar could <br />be bronze/metal.<br />5. so there were a utsavar ( metal) and another moolavar ( stone)<br />6. now a court poet couldnt be wrong in three places - and the <br />reference is not a casual mention but one full of ridicule - aka <br />returning it to its original abode..<br />7. so an idol was put into the sea - and was later recovered and <br />restored back into the temple compound....this is where it defies <br />logic . first of all it would take a lot of effort to dislocate a <br />massive stone idol and to carry it all the way to the sea and drop <br />it - then fishermen finding it - how did they bring it up and again <br />move it back into the compound - would the king allow it to happen - <br />then why drop it in the first place??</p>
<p>another idol ( metal) moves to lower tirupathi - was this then the <br />utsavar that got dropped into the sea - makes more sense that way...</p>
<p>the stone utsavar - moved from earlier location facing natarajar - <br />somewhere within the temple compound. the metal moolavar dropped <br />into the sea - found by fishermen - sent to tirupathi and <br />consecrated there...</p>

        <p>Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>That is easily contested from a Vaishnavite Perspective. It was true <br />that no one was even able to near Narasimha due to the heat <br />generated due to His anger. It is said that even Lakshmi, who is the <br />embodiment of Karunya, could not<br />go near Her husband. Then every one prayed to Prahaladha himself to <br />go forward and bring down the "ugram" of Narasimha. On seeing the <br />innocent (did I say that?? Afterall he was the greatest Bhaktha) <br />face of the child Prahaladha, (for whose cause, Vishnu took the <br />Narasimha Avatar) Narasimha cooled down and only then Lakshmi was <br />able to near Him.</p>
<p>This is espoused in the ThiruvallikkENi pAsuram of Periya Thirumozhi <br />by Thirumangai Azhwar.</p>
<p>paLLiyil Odhi vandthan than siRuvan vAyil Or Ayira nAmam<br />oLLiyavAgi pOdha Angadhanukku, onRumOr poRuppilanAgi<br />piLLaiyaicheeri venguNdu thooNpudhaippa, piRayeiRRanal vizhipEzhwAi<br />theLLia singamAgiya thEvai thiruvallikkENi kaNDEnE!!</p>
<p>Azhwar, as evident from the pAsuram above, clearly says that <br />the "Ugra simham" became "theLLia singam" due to Prahaladha. </p>
<p>Again I dont want to contest a tale here, but the SthalapuraNams. <br />The reason is the happening of a tale is a 50-50 probability based <br />on the beliefs of the individual, but the sthalapuraNams never go <br />well with the History. One will notice that 95% of the kings <br />mentioned in a sthalapuranam will never find a mention anywhere in <br />History. There are a very handful of divyadesams, whose <br />sthalapuranams are atleast closer if not exactly matching with <br />History. Srirangam for one is much better as can be seen from the <br />Temple Chronicles called the "Koil Ozhugu". </p>

<p>  I agree with what you say that many stories may have<br />  been invented as marketing tactics for the temple.<br />  There are several stories like that about Shiva too<br />  (The mohini basmasura tale where Shiva takes refuge in<br />  Vishnu to save him).</p>
<p>  Personally I have found them interesting and useful<br />  for their morals and similes to some situation<br />  spiritual or otherwise.If we look at them as<br />  independant tales not some correlation on a larger<br />  scale it may make some sense.</p>

<p>    Mr Vijay</p>
<p>    You share my thoughts too. The stories of Vishnu<br />    getting ostracised <br />    by Siva, in the Sarabeshwarar or ThiruvIzhimizhalai<br />    legend and vice <br />    versa are, in my humble opinion, at best fictitious.<br />    I, for one, do <br />    not want to believe these Sthala Puranams, which<br />    associates an <br />    ancient Puranam, for even a temple built as recently<br />    as 150 years <br />    ago. </p>
<p>    I was watching the Jaya TV sometime back and they<br />    were showing about <br />    the Mannargudi Rajagopala Swamy temple. It is very<br />    well know that it <br />    was built during the times of Kulothunga I and he<br />    built it during <br />    his "kADu thiruthi nADu paDuthum paNi". But<br />    immediately the presenter <br />    started associating some PuraNa which did mention<br />    about a PerumAL <br />    being present there. How!!!??? How in the world is<br />    this possible. </p>
<p>    Like wise the Sarabeswarar legend is very funny. It<br />    is said that Siva <br />    took the form of Sarabeswarar to kill Vishnu. First<br />    of all what is <br />    the motive? Afterall Vishnu took the form of<br />    Narasimha to protect his <br />    own devotee, Prahaladha. He did achieve His mission.<br />    What was the <br />    need of Siva to kill Him? Okay let us ascribe some<br />    motive and accept <br />    it for argument sake. Off late, we can see the<br />    legend of Pratyangira <br />    becoming famous and more with the visits of ex-CM JJ<br />    to the temple in <br />    Sholinganallur. The legend behind Pratyangira is<br />    that, Parvathi or <br />    Kaali took the form of Female lion and killed<br />    Narasimha. My God!!! If <br />    the husband has killed a person earlier, why would<br />    the wife need to <br />    take another form to kill the same person and again<br />    what is the <br />    motive. Or did Parvathi kill a "dead snake"? </p>
<p>    It is just that our ancestors who framed all these<br />    stories wanted to <br />    ascribe some antiquity to all these stories by way<br />    of a SthalapurANam <br />    so that the temple can be glorified. Really funny<br />    marketing tactics.</p>
<p>    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>
<p>    PS: Just for the records, the number of<br />    Sthalapuranams of Vaishnavite <br />    temples that associate Siva with it are too less<br />    compared to that of <br />    the Saivite temples that associate Vishnu with<br />    worshipping Siva at <br />    those temples. Do we get some insight into this??</p>

<p>        Mr Rahul,</p>
<p>        This is indeed my first post in this group. Ha<br />    Ha Ha.... The <br />        Vaishnavite in me screaming!!!! </p>
<p>      dear sps,</p>
<p>      Of the four major rulers of tamil land - atleast<br />    post kalabara <br />      period....most kings were shivites or atleast they<br />    built more shiva <br />      temples ( venkat please correct me if i am<br />    wrong)....keeping this <br />    is <br />      mind and the fact that both mal and shiva are not<br />    named in the <br />    vedic <br />      hymns ( ok - no direct reference) - whereas indra<br />    ( indra vizha <br />      quoted in much detail in silapathigram ...<br />    govardhana giri episode <br />      arose due to the villagers displeasing indra...n<br />    he sent a hail <br />    storm <br />      etc).... when and why did indra worship stop. the<br />    rest of the hymns <br />      address the nature gods - incl agni, vayu, varuna<br />    etc..we have to <br />      accept that our religion has continually morphed<br />    itself. ( tks to <br />      rajini tiruvanaamalai is now a rediscovered - such<br />    a great history <br />      but it too was but forgotten ) - sakthi<br />    worship.....etc etc.</p>
<p>      But in my limited reading ( my personal opinion<br />    alone) one person <br />    to <br />      whom i would credit the revival of hinduism in<br />    tamil land is appar -</p>
<p>      if not for him maybe we would all be vijay jain,<br />    bhradwaj jain n <br />    run <br />      pawn broking shops...just joking</p>
<p>      secondly - shiva temple contruction and<br />    iconogrpahic questions - <br />    the <br />      lingothbhava icon n story - is irremovable from<br />    any shaivite <br />    temple - <br />      the depiction belittles the other gods in the<br />    trinity - where and <br />    why <br />      did the need to break away from the threesome<br />    arose ( poor brahma - <br />      he lost the race in india but still i supreme in<br />    thailand as pra <br />      phrom) and instead of portraying the lord slaying<br />    demons when did <br />      this competition arise - how do you expect a<br />    vaishnavite to come <br />      into a shiva temple with such standard fittings.</p>
<p>      take swamimalai - look at the thanthaikku<br />    upadesam gopuram <br />      sculpture - you will see mal offerring his<br />    respects to the the <br />    father <br />      n son duo - another freeze has shiva ( a seated<br />    shiva) handing over <br />      the sudarshana chakram to ( standing) vishnu - any<br />    anantha sayana <br />      freeze has shiva offering respects...looks like<br />    both sides vies <br />    with <br />      each other - in almost childish exuberance -<br />    belittleing mals' <br />      tortoise avataram - in tirukachur you see him<br />    praying in his kacha <br />      form to the shiva lingam....the sarabeshwarar<br />    legend n idols....</p>
<p>      on the contrary early pallava for eg - in mallai -<br />    arjuna penance <br />      panel - u see an almost complete vishnu shrine<br />    ....why? why did the <br />      shore temple jala sayana perumal be alongside the<br />    shiva temple - <br />    but <br />      somewhere the competition started - in the early<br />    soma skanda <br />    panels -<br />      the divine couple n skanda are flanked by flying<br />    gandarvas - but <br />      later depictions they morph into vishnu and<br />    brahma.... in kaanchi <br />      kailasantha temple - a prominent lingothbhavar<br />    comes up - in the <br />      natraja urdva thandavam - shiva is shown dancing<br />    with vishnu and <br />      brahma appreciating it .... we have already talked<br />    enough of chola <br />      temples...chera - few remain</p>
<p>      somewhere down this line things got so polarised<br />    and due to the <br />      presence of the dominant shivism ( atleast<br />    demographic size) the <br />      vaishnavites started feeling threatened and<br />    cocooned them into <br />    going <br />      against the basic tenants of a polytheistic form<br />    instead taking it <br />      into a monotheistic base, whether its right or<br />    wrong - we must <br />    agree <br />      that both versions - are not good for the basic<br />    structure of <br />      something as divine as the original version.</p>
<p>      though i do appreciate these rivalries for they<br />    created <br />  === message truncated ===</p>

        <p>I get to see some obscure characters. I am not able to read it in <br />Tamizh. Can some one guide me as to how to get it done.</p>
<p>Mr Vijay,</p>
<p>Excellent writeup. For a Vaishnavite perspective, the story of <br />Chidambaram goes like this (Could be a well exaggerated and <br />aberrated one). Once, there was a competition between Nataraja and <br />Thillai Kaali as to who is the best dancer. They decided to compete <br />it out. As Vishnu is the Supreme Being (for the Vaishnavite <br />Perspective) they approached Him to be the judge. So Vishnu in the <br />form of Govindaraja came and reclined at Chidambaram to be the judge <br />for the competition. This is how both the murthys came into <br />existence in the same temple. </p>
<p>The story goes on to get completed thus, when Nataraja did the most <br />wonderful cosmic form of the dance by lifting His leg, which Kaali <br />could not do due to the inherent shyness of a Woman and thus <br />Govindaraja declared Nataraja as the winner. I dont know if any one <br />of you heard this before. But I have heard it umpteen times.</p>
<p>=========Quote================<br />therupon vishnu lay prostrate ( </p>
<blockquote><p>  bhoga sayana) in the hall of thillai inorder that his prayers to <br />see <br />  the other leg might be granted.<br />========Unquote===============</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a different view of this. Fine that it was recorded by <br />Manikkavasagar. But can someone confirm if Manikkavasagar used the <br />word "prostrate". The reason I ask this is, Logically, a person who <br />is praying or prostrating would never be in such comfortable Bhoga <br />Sayana pose. Rather, only the person, who is so very comfortable and <br />doesn't need anything more, would be in such a pose. I am sure you <br />would all agree to this logic. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Also as I am unable to read the Tamizh verses below, please clarify.</p>
<p>But Personally my opinion about the co-existence of both the murthys <br />at the same temple is different. In my humble opinion, as I would <br />always, I would discard the Sthalapuranic versions of both <br />Vaishnavites and Saivites. I would only say that both were in <br />separate temples close to each other, with no connection whatsoever. <br />When Kulothunga II wanted to expand the temple of Nataraja, it is <br />recorded that he approached the Vaishnavites of the area to <br />dislocate the Govindaraja shrine for which there was a vehement <br />opposition. Irked at it, he got the Murthy removed from the temple. <br />This is recorded by the court poet Ottakoothar in his ThakkayAga <br />bharaNi too. Now there is also the account of the Senji, king, re-<br />installing the Perumal in the shrine, much against the opposition of <br />the Dhikshitars. I would only say that the Vaishnavites were very <br />good in getting the king convinced that the Nataraja temple was <br />expanded over the old Vishnu temple and hence Govindaraja needs to <br />be re-instated there. This king being a staunch Vaishnavite did so <br />with his authority.</p>
<p>So the basic problem, in my opinion, in Chidambaram, is the egoistic <br />authorities of two Kings during two different era, which has give <br />rise to the Saivite-Vaishnavite conflict.</p>
<p>I request the learned members to correct me, wherever I am wrong in <br />my above assumptions.</p>

<p>  pg 26</p>
<p>  he quotes KAN - colas - </p>
<p>  there were several temples which containeed shrines of both shiva <br />and <br />  vishnu side by side - the most conspicuous instance being that of <br />  chidambaram"</p>
<p>  the saivates regard this diety of govindaraja at thillai as <br />admiring <br />  the divine dance of nataraja ... it is inferred that this deity <br />must <br />  have been housed on an elevated platform in the prakara of the <br />natraja <br />  temple in front of the natraja shrine. hence the place of abode of <br />  vishnu is called terri ambalam or tiru citra kutam. in early times <br />( <br />  atleast upto to the days of tirumangai alvar and kulasekara alvar, <br />the <br />  worship of the two dieties, nataraja and govindaraja, was in the <br />hands <br />  of the thillai 3000.</p>
<p>  the co existence of natraja and govindaraja is clearly documented <br />by <br />  manikkavacakar...whose tirukkovaiyur is a subjective poem - the <br />  ahapporul on the lord of tillai. in this we find a stanza which <br />refers <br />  to the position of the twin gods, shiva and vishnu thus : he <br />(vishnu ) <br />  eho tried in vain by splitting open the earth, inorder to see the <br />two <br />  feet of him who destroyed the tripura, begged of siva with <br />extended <br />  hands to show them, out of mercy, for worship. then the lord, <br />moved <br />  somewhat showed vishnu one of his legs. therupon vishnu lay <br />prostrate ( <br />  bhoga sayana) in the hall of thillai inorder that his prayers to <br />see <br />  the other leg might be granted.</p>

<p>Last hymn indicates AMARNTHA (in sitting posture also)..apart from <br />THIRUVIKRAMA, SAYANA PERUMAL and NARASIMHA..</p>
<p>But the mention GOVINDARAJA does not FIGURE any where.<br />------------ <br />Dear Vijay..</p>
<p>In the " Thillai &amp; Nataraja" by B. Natarajan, page 64, <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastri <br />mentioning the EARLIEST REFERENCE to the relative portions of the <br />shrines Govindaraja and Nataraja is that of Manickavasagar in <br />thirukkovaiyar (Verse 86).. </acronym></p>
<p>AND the AUTHOR (Natarajan) considering MANICKAVASAGAR prior to <br />Azhwars ! (In the same book remember the period stated as 6th AD !!)</p>
<p>I am YET to find mention of GOVINDARAJA in any of the ancient <br />Regligeous Text.. (yet to go through Kulasekara, tho" the quotes are <br />not mentioning of Govindaraja)..</p>
<p>Author Natarajan has also cited his father SR BALASUBRAMANIAN's <br />quote in Later Chola Temples (1979, pp 50 - 51):: / extract/</p>
<p>WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND REFUTED IDENTIFICATION OF KIRUMI KANDA CHOZHAN <br />WITH KULOTHUNGA- I AND THE BELIEF POPULAR AMONG VIASHANAVITES THAT <br />RAMNUJA FLED TO MELKOTE IN KARNATAKA COUNTRY AS A RESULT OF BEING <br />PERSECUTED BY THE CHOLA KING LIVING IN EXILE THERE FROM 1098 TO 1122.</p>
<p>There are TWO direct references to submersion ::</p>

<p>Rasarasa Chozhanula..</p>
<p>---------------<br />We cannot IGNORE the MENTION OF CHITRAKUDAM.</p>
<p>Whether they are Paadagams?<br />Bronzes?<br />Sculptures?</p>
<p>Who / When established in Chidambaram?</p>
<p>Could not the King find another shrine atleast - instead of Sea - to <br />move the Deity ?</p>
<p>If to be submerged in Sea .. then why Sea ?</p>
<p>Then what is the Golden Narayan + horses which Malik kafur looted?</p>
<p>we will discuss and try to find answers ...</p>

<p>  You share my thoughts too. The stories of Vishnu getting ostracised <br />  by Siva, in the Sarabeshwarar or ThiruvIzhimizhalai legend and vice <br />  versa are, in my humble opinion, at best fictitious. I, for one, do <br />  not want to believe these Sthala Puranams, which associates an <br />  ancient Puranam, for even a temple built as recently as 150 years <br />  ago. </p>
<p>Hi venkatesh</p></blockquote>
<p>I had a similar arguement in another forum.... The problem in this debate is the strength of convictions on both sides... First of all we read our scriptures n get captivated by it ... Which isn't wrong, but this myopic reading can at best make you comment of what you have read ..... To be the best,but the very fact that what you read stopped you from reading the others handicaps ur judgement ... U can only say yous is good but can't use the comparitive epithets like better best etc.</p>
<p>Inorder to look into something impartially you need to come a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  out of it.... Within the abraminical religions u can see how interpretations n beliefs spawned entirely new religions..despite these or because of these crusades were launched .... So we need to accept these....when the heart takes precdence over the brain....</p>
<p>Ok, some more questions... .mallai there is no depiction of ganesha ... Why? We read of paranjothi bringing in vatapi pillaiyar... but some pillaiyar shrines in tamil nadu predate this era by centuries... Why then is the somasskanda panel depicting only one son of shiva... Who is the elder son... Famous mango fight shows murugan as the second born ( can I use born?). </p>
<p>Mallai again dasavatara panel lists buddha in the place of krishna ... Why...but krishna govardhana panel is depicted in all glory...</p>
<p>Jump to thillai ... Patanjali munivar... We hear of myths of his being an incarnation of adi sesha...</p>
<p>More questions... Nandhi is shown as the chief of shiva ganas...but later ganesha takes that place..</p>
<p>......</p>

<p>    this is from a book ( thanks sps sir for sharing)<br />  ..thillai and <br />  natraja <br />    by sri b, natarajan ( son of sri<br />  s.r.balsubramniam)...</p>
<p>  contrinues - chapt 10 - pgs 165 onwards..</p>
<p>  thillai is undoubtedly the most conspicuos example<br />  of a religious <br />  centre where siva and vishnu co exist - the mohini /<br />  bhikshatana <br />  episode in the daruka forest is itself striking<br />  testimoney of the age <br />  old eclecticism of the thillai trradition. while<br />  thillai tiruc <br />  cirrambalam is sacred to the sivites, tillai tiruc<br />  citrakulam is <br />  equally sacred to teh vaishnvaites. terri ambalam or<br />  tiruc citrakutam <br />  is an elevated platform, on which the govindaraja<br />  shrine has been <br />  consecrated in the earliest times.</p>
<p>  the anqituity of the govindaraja shrine and its<br />  early history, the <br />  oldest references of tirumangai and kulasekara ( ref<br />  prev <br />  post) ....show that stone idol of lord vishnu and<br />  rama ( metal idol) <br />  are mentioned and as being wroshipped by the 3000. </p>
<p>  during the regin of kulottunga II( ad 1133-1150) his<br />  court poet <br />  ottakuttan ula's and his work entitled<br />  takkayagapparani descibe the <br />  various servies rendered to the natraja temple by<br />  kulottunga II and <br />  say that in order to find space for the expansion of<br />  the siva temple <br />  adn its renovation work - the vishnu god has to be<br />  forced back to its <br />  former abode - the sea. from vaishnavite accounts on<br />  ramanuja and <br />  other v';te literature - it is learnt that the<br />  vishnu diety was <br />  thrown in the sea ( near killai) and the shrine<br />  itself was got <br />  vacated to create addnl space for teh cola ruler to<br />  expand the siva <br />  temple. at the time of ramanuja ( ad 1016-17 to<br />  1137) the citrakuta <br />  was known to hv been removed from the scene. the<br />  image of govindaraja <br />  was shifted away by the viashnavas to tirupati and<br />  when ramanuja <br />  heard of the removal of vishnu shrine and the<br />  subsequent <br />  transportation of the image to lower tirupathi, he<br />  had the <br />  govindaraja image consecrated and enshrined in what<br />  is know now as <br />  the ogvindaraja tmeple at lower tirupathi.<br />  mahavidvan m raghava <br />  aiyangar ( one fo the revered scholars of this<br />  century) is reported <br />  to have determined the date of this episode as ad<br />  1127. the removal <br />  of the idol and the consecration at lower tirpathi<br />  should have taken <br />  place somewhere between ad 1123 adn 1136 perhaps<br />  nearer the latter <br />  date. ( some scholars maintain that the govindaraja<br />  at tirupathi is <br />  different)</p>
<p>  NOW COMES THE MOST INTERESTING PART...</p>
<p>  the massive mulavar ( vishnu in stone in a lying<br />  posture on the <br />  serpent couch) must have been allowed to remain<br />  somwhere wihtin the <br />  tmeple campus on a platform. myu discussions with<br />  some of the present <br />  trustees of the sri govindaraja shrine indicate the<br />  traditional <br />  belief that even when the massive stone idol was<br />  thrown into the sea <br />  near killai, the fishermen of teh area were quick to<br />  bring it shore <br />  and restore it to the templeat chindambaram for<br />  preservation, perhaps <br />  at some obscure place within the temple </p>
<p>  .........THERE ARE MORE STRUCTURAL AND ARCHITECTURAL<br />  DISCUSSIONS - <br />  BUT SKIPPNG THEM FOR NOW .....</p>
<p>  in retrospect, the entire problem seems to be a part<br />  of the alrger <br />  context of the co existence of nataraja and<br />  govindaraja in such <br />  proximity.thus the second quarter of this cetnury<br />  brought back to <br />  cidambaram, its great traditions, where succesive<br />  generations of <br />  princes, nobles and devotees of every rank have paid<br />  their hearts <br />  homage to him who is immersed in yogic sleep and to<br />  him who performs <br />  the dance divine to sustain life in this world.<br />  govindaraja - vishnu <br />  reclining on adi sesha - looks on from this posture<br />  the ecstatic <br />  dance of nataraja . he is a spectator, a sakshi -<br />  the yoga nidra - or <br />  the sleep of yoga of govindaraja points to a state<br />  of transcendental <br />  bliss and tranquility. while govindaraja embodies<br />  detachment and rest <br />  from action, nataraja pulsates with creative will<br />  and vibrant energy. <br />  in a real sense, therefore, govindraja is involved,<br />  though <br />  indireclty, in the cosmic dance of natraja - the two<br />  aspects are <br />  supplementary and together represent the entire<br />  phenomenon of the <br />  cosmos.</p>
<p>  inscriptions speak of similar co exitence fo siva<br />  and vishnu at <br />  vedaranyam 9 tirumaraikkadu ) in tanjavur dist, but<br />  the vishnu shrine <br />  of old is no longer there at vedaranyam (....phew -<br />  _</p>
<p>  thats it for tdy</p>

<p></p></blockquote>
<p>contrinues - chapt 10 - pgs 165 onwards..</p>
<p>thillai is undoubtedly the most conspicuos example of a religious <br />centre where siva and vishnu co exist - the mohini / bhikshatana <br />episode in the daruka forest is itself striking testimoney of the age <br />old eclecticism of the thillai trradition. while thillai tiruc <br />cirrambalam is sacred to the sivites, tillai tiruc citrakulam is <br />equally sacred to teh vaishnvaites. terri ambalam or tiruc citrakutam <br />is an elevated platform, on which the govindaraja shrine has been <br />consecrated in the earliest times.</p>
<p>the anqituity of the govindaraja shrine and its early history, the <br />oldest references of tirumangai and kulasekara ( ref prev <br />post) ....show that stone idol of lord vishnu and rama ( metal idol) <br />are mentioned and as being wroshipped by the 3000. </p>
<p>during the regin of kulottunga II( ad 1133-1150) his court poet <br />ottakuttan ula's and his work entitled takkayagapparani descibe the <br />various servies rendered to the natraja temple by kulottunga II and <br />say that in order to find space for the expansion of the siva temple <br />adn its renovation work - the vishnu god has to be forced back to its <br />former abode - the sea. from vaishnavite accounts on ramanuja and <br />other v';te literature - it is learnt that the vishnu diety was <br />thrown in the sea ( near killai) and the shrine itself was got <br />vacated to create addnl space for teh cola ruler to expand the siva <br />temple. at the time of ramanuja ( ad 1016-17 to 1137) the citrakuta <br />was known to hv been removed from the scene. the image of govindaraja <br />was shifted away by the viashnavas to tirupati and when ramanuja <br />heard of the removal of vishnu shrine and the subsequent <br />transportation of the image to lower tirupathi, he had the <br />govindaraja image consecrated and enshrined in what is know now as <br />the ogvindaraja tmeple at lower tirupathi. mahavidvan m raghava <br />aiyangar ( one fo the revered scholars of this century) is reported <br />to have determined the date of this episode as ad 1127. the removal <br />of the idol and the consecration at lower tirpathi should have taken <br />place somewhere between ad 1123 adn 1136 perhaps nearer the latter <br />date. ( some scholars maintain that the govindaraja at tirupathi is <br />different)</p>
<p>NOW COMES THE MOST INTERESTING PART...</p>
<p>the massive mulavar ( vishnu in stone in a lying posture on the <br />serpent couch) must have been allowed to remain somwhere wihtin the <br />tmeple campus on a platform. myu discussions with some of the present <br />trustees of the sri govindaraja shrine indicate the traditional <br />belief that even when the massive stone idol was thrown into the sea <br />near killai, the fishermen of teh area were quick to bring it shore <br />and restore it to the templeat chindambaram for preservation, perhaps <br />at some obscure place within the temple </p>
<p>.........THERE ARE MORE STRUCTURAL AND ARCHITECTURAL DISCUSSIONS - <br />BUT SKIPPNG THEM FOR NOW .....</p>
<p>in retrospect, the entire problem seems to be a part of the alrger <br />context of the co existence of nataraja and govindaraja in such <br />proximity.thus the second quarter of this cetnury brought back to <br />cidambaram, its great traditions, where succesive generations of <br />princes, nobles and devotees of every rank have paid their hearts <br />homage to him who is immersed in yogic sleep and to him who performs <br />the dance divine to sustain life in this world. govindaraja - vishnu <br />reclining on adi sesha - looks on from this posture the ecstatic <br />dance of nataraja . he is a spectator, a sakshi - the yoga nidra - or <br />the sleep of yoga of govindaraja points to a state of transcendental <br />bliss and tranquility. while govindaraja embodies detachment and rest <br />from action, nataraja pulsates with creative will and vibrant energy. <br />in a real sense, therefore, govindraja is involved, though <br />indireclty, in the cosmic dance of natraja - the two aspects are <br />supplementary and together represent the entire phenomenon of the <br />cosmos.</p>
<p>inscriptions speak of similar co exitence fo siva and vishnu at <br />vedaranyam 9 tirumaraikkadu ) in tanjavur dist, but the vishnu shrine <br />of old is no longer there at vedaranyam (....phew - _</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>this is from a book ( thanks sps sir for sharing) ..thillai and natraja <br />by sri b, natarajan ( son of sri s.r.balsubramniam)...</p>
<p>pg 26</p>
<p>he quotes <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  - colas - </p>
<p>there were several temples which containeed shrines of both shiva and <br />vishnu side by side - the most conspicuous instance being that of <br />chidambaram"</p>
<p>the saivates regard this diety of govindaraja at thillai as admiring <br />the divine dance of nataraja ... it is inferred that this deity must <br />have been housed on an elevated platform in the prakara of the natraja <br />temple in front of the natraja shrine. hence the place of abode of <br />vishnu is called terri ambalam or tiru citra kutam. in early times ( <br />atleast upto to the days of tirumangai alvar and kulasekara alvar, the <br />worship of the two dieties, nataraja and govindaraja, was in the hands <br />of the thillai 3000.</p>
<p>the co existence of natraja and govindaraja is clearly documented by <br />manikkavacakar...whose tirukkovaiyur is a subjective poem - the <br />ahapporul on the lord of tillai. in this we find a stanza which refers <br />to the position of the twin gods, shiva and vishnu thus : he (vishnu ) <br />eho tried in vain by splitting open the earth, inorder to see the two <br />feet of him who destroyed the tripura, begged of siva with extended <br />hands to show them, out of mercy, for worship. then the lord, moved <br />somewhat showed vishnu one of his legs. therupon vishnu lay prostrate ( <br />bhoga sayana) in the hall of thillai inorder that his prayers to see <br />the other leg might be granted.</p>

<p>malik kafur invaded a decade earlier. must be 1311-1312.<br />what temples he left was wiped out in the second turkish invasion a <br />decade later. but only temples on the way to madurai.<br />thanjai was not touched.<br />lots of things are not clear during this period.<br />temples like madurai and srirangam have functioned quite well in the <br />period between the two invasions.<br />chidambaram has not functioned.<br />another opinion on bramastapuri could it have been sirkali?</p>
<p>but one has to remember all these are from the accounts of the turks <br />wassaf and khusro. they even called madurai 'maabaar'.</p>

<p>  You have literally bombarded me with informations. I will try to <br />  analyse the possibility of a Chola King being the reason behind <br />  Ramanuja's exile. I request some time before I reply to this. I <br />will <br />  reply to this within a week's time.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh<br />---------------------</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear V.Venkatesh,</p>
<p>I brought out a sample of earlier discussions on this subject..</p>
<p>But I should HEARTILY THANK YOU for the whole of today I was reading <br />the PERIYA THIRUMOZHI on CHITRAKOODAM .. re Chidambaram temples to <br />find really what happened ...</p>
<p>The information curve is getting formed.. <br />Let me put some of them after organising them within myself ..</p>
<p>But I can put a synopsis now itself :</p>
<p>hymns of ::</p>
<p>1. Sayana Vishnu / Ranganathar<br />2. Ulagalandhan (Trivikraman)<br />3. Madhavan and<br />4. Exclusively of Kannan ( with his Leelas listed) as <br />CHITRAKOODAMULLAN.</p>
<p>Giving enough reasons that there was more than one deity <br />( Worshippable Padagams Galleried ?)</p>
<p>II. Definition of EDIRALMBALAM (KANOJI STONE EPISODE ) : It is <br />opposite to Moolasthanam (Adhi Siva shrine ) North of Present <br />Nataraja Sanctum.</p>
<p>III. Grants by Chola Kings - Particularly Kulothunga I, his wife, <br />sister, son vikrama chola, Kulothunga II and III to Chidambaram <br />temples.</p>
<p>IV. Yet to identify the Deity was GOVINDARAJAR during Kulothunga <br />period in Chidambaram from Prabandahams.</p>
<p>V. Thillimovayiravars established and worshipped Chitrakoodam (as <br />could be seen from Periyathirumozhi).</p>
<p>VI. The period of Govindarajar having been kept in Thirumala <br />(thirupathi) by St Ramanujar :: No GRANT BY KRISHNADEVARAYAR TO THIS <br />DIETY in his entire tenure.</p>
<p>VII.. The resistence during Achutha Royar period by Diskshidhars :: <br />It was not against Govindarajaperumal episode alone.. It was against <br />the ATTEMPT TO CONVERT Chidambaram Temple as VAISHNAVITIE SHRINE !!<br />(British Account ) </p>
<p>VIII. Post Malik Kafur period for 70 years NO POOJA FOR NATARAJA</p>
<p>IX. Malik Gafur (1327 .. AD) invaded Brahastapuri - having Siva <br />Linga and Golden Narayana with Horses and a view that it was <br />Chidambaram is not refuted..</p>
<p>Any assistance on these views will be helpful to summerise.</p>
<p>Greetings.</p>

        <p>Venkat2, whatever little I know from my grandmother,<br />Narasimha's anger was not appeased even after killing<br />Hiranya so Parvati or Shiva decided to confront the<br />lion (not exactly Vishnu). </p>
<p>I agree with what you say that many stories may have<br />been invented as marketing tactics for the temple.<br />There are several stories like that about Shiva too<br />(The mohini basmasura tale where Shiva takes refuge in<br />Vishnu to save him).</p>
<p>Personally I have found them interesting and useful<br />for their morals and similes to some situation<br />spiritual or otherwise.If we look at them as<br />independant tales not some correlation on a larger<br />scale it may make some sense.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Mr Vijay</p>
<p>  You share my thoughts too. The stories of Vishnu<br />  getting ostracised <br />  by Siva, in the Sarabeshwarar or ThiruvIzhimizhalai<br />  legend and vice <br />  versa are, in my humble opinion, at best fictitious.<br />  I, for one, do <br />  not want to believe these Sthala Puranams, which<br />  associates an <br />  ancient Puranam, for even a temple built as recently<br />  as 150 years <br />  ago. </p>
<p>  I was watching the Jaya TV sometime back and they<br />  were showing about <br />  the Mannargudi Rajagopala Swamy temple. It is very<br />  well know that it <br />  was built during the times of Kulothunga I and he<br />  built it during <br />  his "kADu thiruthi nADu paDuthum paNi". But<br />  immediately the presenter <br />  started associating some PuraNa which did mention<br />  about a PerumAL <br />  being present there. How!!!??? How in the world is<br />  this possible. </p>
<p>  Like wise the Sarabeswarar legend is very funny. It<br />  is said that Siva <br />  took the form of Sarabeswarar to kill Vishnu. First<br />  of all what is <br />  the motive? Afterall Vishnu took the form of<br />  Narasimha to protect his <br />  own devotee, Prahaladha. He did achieve His mission.<br />  What was the <br />  need of Siva to kill Him? Okay let us ascribe some<br />  motive and accept <br />  it for argument sake. Off late, we can see the<br />  legend of Pratyangira <br />  becoming famous and more with the visits of ex-CM JJ<br />  to the temple in <br />  Sholinganallur. The legend behind Pratyangira is<br />  that, Parvathi or <br />  Kaali took the form of Female lion and killed<br />  Narasimha. My God!!! If <br />  the husband has killed a person earlier, why would<br />  the wife need to <br />  take another form to kill the same person and again<br />  what is the <br />  motive. Or did Parvathi kill a "dead snake"? </p>
<p>  It is just that our ancestors who framed all these<br />  stories wanted to <br />  ascribe some antiquity to all these stories by way<br />  of a SthalapurANam <br />  so that the temple can be glorified. Really funny<br />  marketing tactics.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</p>
<p>  PS: Just for the records, the number of<br />  Sthalapuranams of Vaishnavite <br />  temples that associate Siva with it are too less<br />  compared to that of <br />  the Saivite temples that associate Vishnu with<br />  worshipping Siva at <br />  those temples. Do we get some insight into this??</p>

<p>      Mr Rahul,</p>
<p>      This is indeed my first post in this group. Ha<br />  Ha Ha.... The <br />      Vaishnavite in me screaming!!!! </p>
<p>    dear sps,</p>
<p>    Of the four major rulers of tamil land - atleast<br />  post kalabara <br />    period....most kings were shivites or atleast they<br />  built more shiva <br />    temples ( venkat please correct me if i am<br />  wrong)....keeping this <br />  is <br />    mind and the fact that both mal and shiva are not<br />  named in the <br />  vedic <br />    hymns ( ok - no direct reference) - whereas indra<br />  ( indra vizha <br />    quoted in much detail in silapathigram ...<br />  govardhana giri episode <br />    arose due to the villagers displeasing indra...n<br />  he sent a hail <br />  storm <br />    etc).... when and why did indra worship stop. the<br />  rest of the hymns <br />    address the nature gods - incl agni, vayu, varuna<br />  etc..we have to <br />    accept that our religion has continually morphed<br />  itself. ( tks to <br />    rajini tiruvanaamalai is now a rediscovered - such<br />  a great history <br />    but it too was but forgotten ) - sakthi<br />  worship.....etc etc.</p>
<p>    But in my limited reading ( my personal opinion<br />  alone) one person <br />  to <br />    whom i would credit the revival of hinduism in<br />  tamil land is appar -</p>
<p>    if not for him maybe we would all be vijay jain,<br />  bhradwaj jain n <br />  run <br />    pawn broking shops...just joking</p>
<p>    secondly - shiva temple contruction and<br />  iconogrpahic questions - <br />  the <br />    lingothbhava icon n story - is irremovable from<br />  any shaivite <br />  temple - <br />    the depiction belittles the other gods in the<br />  trinity - where and <br />  why <br />    did the need to break away from the threesome<br />  arose ( poor brahma - <br />    he lost the race in india but still i supreme in<br />  thailand as pra <br />    phrom) and instead of portraying the lord slaying<br />  demons when did <br />    this competition arise - how do you expect a<br />  vaishnavite to come <br />    into a shiva temple with such standard fittings.</p>
<p>    take swamimalai - look at the thanthaikku<br />  upadesam gopuram <br />    sculpture - you will see mal offerring his<br />  respects to the the <br />  father <br />    n son duo - another freeze has shiva ( a seated<br />  shiva) handing over <br />    the sudarshana chakram to ( standing) vishnu - any<br />  anantha sayana <br />    freeze has shiva offering respects...looks like<br />  both sides vies <br />  with <br />    each other - in almost childish exuberance -<br />  belittleing mals' <br />    tortoise avataram - in tirukachur you see him<br />  praying in his kacha <br />    form to the shiva lingam....the sarabeshwarar<br />  legend n idols....</p>
<p>    on the contrary early pallava for eg - in mallai -<br />  arjuna penance <br />    panel - u see an almost complete vishnu shrine<br />  ....why? why did the <br />    shore temple jala sayana perumal be alongside the<br />  shiva temple - <br />  but <br />    somewhere the competition started - in the early<br />  soma skanda <br />  panels -<br />    the divine couple n skanda are flanked by flying<br />  gandarvas - but <br />    later depictions they morph into vishnu and<br />  brahma.... in kaanchi <br />    kailasantha temple - a prominent lingothbhavar<br />  comes up - in the <br />    natraja urdva thandavam - shiva is shown dancing<br />  with vishnu and <br />    brahma appreciating it .... we have already talked<br />  enough of chola <br />    temples...chera - few remain</p>
<p>    somewhere down this line things got so polarised<br />  and due to the <br />    presence of the dominant shivism ( atleast<br />  demographic size) the <br />    vaishnavites started feeling threatened and<br />  cocooned them into <br />  going <br />    against the basic tenants of a polytheistic form<br />  instead taking it <br />    into a monotheistic base, whether its right or<br />  wrong - we must <br />  agree <br />    that both versions - are not good for the basic<br />  structure of <br />    something as divine as the original version.</p>
<p>    though i do appreciate these rivalries for they<br />  created <br />=== message truncated ===</p></vinjamoor_venkatesh@></p></vj.episteme@...></p></blockquote>

<p>Hi venkatesh</p></blockquote>
<p>I had a similar arguement in another forum.... The problem in this debate is the strength of convictions on both sides... First of all we read our scriptures n get captivated by it ... Which isn't wrong, but this myopic reading can at best make you comment of what you have read ..... To be the best,but the very fact that what you read stopped you from reading the others handicaps ur judgement ... U can only say yous is good but can't use the comparitive epithets like better best etc.</p>
<p>Inorder to look into something impartially you need to come a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  out of it.... Within the abraminical religions u can see how interpretations n beliefs spawned entirely new religions..despite these or because of these crusades were launched .... So we need to accept these....when the heart takes precdence over the brain....</p>
<p>Ok, some more questions....mallai there is no depiction of ganesha ... Why?We read of paranjothi bringing in vatapi pillaiyar...but some pillaiyar shrines in tamil nadu predate this era by centuries... Why then is the somasskanda panel depicting only one son of shiva... Who is the elder son... Famous mango fight shows murugan as the second born ( can I use born?). </p>
<p>Mallai again dasavatara panel lists buddha in the place of krishna ... Why...but krishna govardhana panel is depicted in all glory...</p>
<p>Jump to thillai ... Patanjali munivar... We hear of myths of his being an incarnation of adi sesha..</p>
<p>More questions... Nandhi is shown as the chief of shiva ganas...but later ganesha takes that place..</p>
<p>......</p></acronym></p>

<p>      No need to explain the meaning as the Tamizh is<br />  very<br />      simple. Yes, you <br />      look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will<br />  show<br />      himself as Siva, if <br />      you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show<br />  himself as<br />      Vishnu. </p>
<p>      This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when<br />  he<br />      was walking <br />      through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids<br />  of<br />      Srirangam were <br />      playing with the sand, building a temple and on<br />      seeing Ramanuja <br />      called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take<br />  this<br />      prasAdham of your <br />      beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately<br />  obeyed<br />      the kids and <br />      took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand,<br />  with<br />      utmost respect in <br />      the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the<br />      spot. He accepted <br />      the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham.<br />  This<br />      is what is <br />      glorified as bhAva suddhi. </p>
<p>      This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no<br />  true<br />      Srivaishnavite <br />      will disrespect another God.</p>

<p>        A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which<br />  is<br />        better, naamam or thiruneeru.

        <p>It is very simple. Our writer Venketesh writes his name with an 'e'. The<br />other Venkatesh, with an 'a'.<br />There wa an acrimonius exchange between two venkats in another forum; one was k****** venkat and the other started identifying himself as not<br />k****** venkat.</p>

        <p>Mr Vijay</p>
<p>You share my thoughts too. The stories of Vishnu getting ostracised <br />by Siva, in the Sarabeshwarar or ThiruvIzhimizhalai legend and vice <br />versa are, in my humble opinion, at best fictitious. I, for one, do <br />not want to believe these Sthala Puranams, which associates an <br />ancient Puranam, for even a temple built as recently as 150 years <br />ago. </p>
<p>I was watching the Jaya TV sometime back and they were showing about <br />the Mannargudi Rajagopala Swamy temple. It is very well know that it <br />was built during the times of Kulothunga I and he built it during <br />his "kADu thiruthi nADu paDuthum paNi". But immediately the presenter <br />started associating some PuraNa which did mention about a PerumAL <br />being present there. How!!!??? How in the world is this possible. </p>
<p>Like wise the Sarabeswarar legend is very funny. It is said that Siva <br />took the form of Sarabeswarar to kill Vishnu. First of all what is <br />the motive? Afterall Vishnu took the form of Narasimha to protect his <br />own devotee, Prahaladha. He did achieve His mission. What was the <br />need of Siva to kill Him? Okay let us ascribe some motive and accept <br />it for argument sake. Off late, we can see the legend of Pratyangira <br />becoming famous and more with the visits of ex-CM JJ to the temple in <br />Sholinganallur. The legend behind Pratyangira is that, Parvathi or <br />Kaali took the form of Female lion and killed Narasimha. My God!!! If <br />the husband has killed a person earlier, why would the wife need to <br />take another form to kill the same person and again what is the <br />motive. Or did Parvathi kill a "dead snake"? </p>
<p>It is just that our ancestors who framed all these stories wanted to <br />ascribe some antiquity to all these stories by way of a SthalapurANam <br />so that the temple can be glorified. Really funny marketing tactics.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>
<p>PS: Just for the records, the number of Sthalapuranams of Vaishnavite <br />temples that associate Siva with it are too less compared to that of <br />the Saivite temples that associate Vishnu with worshipping Siva at <br />those temples. Do we get some insight into this??</p>

<p>  Of the four major rulers of tamil land - atleast post kalabara <br />  period....most kings were shivites or atleast they built more shiva <br />  temples ( venkat please correct me if i am wrong)....keeping this <br />is <br />  mind and the fact that both mal and shiva are not named in the <br />vedic <br />  hymns ( ok - no direct reference) - whereas indra ( indra vizha <br />  quoted in much detail in silapathigram ... govardhana giri episode <br />  arose due to the villagers displeasing indra...n he sent a hail <br />storm <br />  etc).... when and why did indra worship stop. the rest of the hymns <br />  address the nature gods - incl agni, vayu, varuna etc..we have to <br />  accept that our religion has continually morphed itself. ( tks to <br />  rajini tiruvanaamalai is now a rediscovered - such a great history <br />  but it too was but forgotten ) - sakthi worship.....etc etc.</p>

<p>  secondly - shiva temple contruction and iconogrpahic questions - <br />the <br />  lingothbhava icon n story - is irremovable from any shaivite <br />temple - <br />  the depiction belittles the other gods in the trinity - where and <br />why <br />  did the need to break away from the threesome arose ( poor brahma - <br />  he lost the race in india but still i supreme in thailand as pra <br />  phrom) and instead of portraying the lord slaying demons when did <br />  this competition arise - how do you expect a vaishnavite to come <br />  into a shiva temple with such standard fittings.</p>
<p>  take swamimalai - look at the thanthaikku upadesam gopuram <br />  sculpture - you will see mal offerring his respects to the the <br />father <br />  n son duo - another freeze has shiva ( a seated shiva) handing over <br />  the sudarshana chakram to ( standing) vishnu - any anantha sayana <br />  freeze has shiva offering respects...looks like both sides vies <br />with <br />  each other - in almost childish exuberance - belittleing mals' <br />  tortoise avataram - in tirukachur you see him praying in his kacha <br />  form to the shiva lingam....the sarabeshwarar legend n idols....</p>
<p>  on the contrary early pallava for eg - in mallai - arjuna penance <br />  panel - u see an almost complete vishnu shrine ....why? why did the <br />  shore temple jala sayana perumal be alongside the shiva temple - <br />but <br />  somewhere the competition started - in the early soma skanda <br />panels -<br />  the divine couple n skanda are flanked by flying gandarvas - but <br />  later depictions they morph into vishnu and brahma.... in kaanchi <br />  kailasantha temple - a prominent lingothbhavar comes up - in the <br />  natraja urdva thandavam - shiva is shown dancing with vishnu and <br />  brahma appreciating it .... we have already talked enough of chola <br />  temples...chera - few remain</p>
<p>  somewhere down this line things got so polarised and due to the <br />  presence of the dominant shivism ( atleast demographic size) the <br />  vaishnavites started feeling threatened and cocooned them into <br />going <br />  against the basic tenants of a polytheistic form instead taking it <br />  into a monotheistic base, whether its right or wrong - we must <br />agree <br />  that both versions - are not good for the basic structure of <br />  something as divine as the original version.</p>
<p>  though i do appreciate these rivalries for they created lot of bed <br />  time stories n sculptural beauties ..... they ( both sdies) have <br />to <br />  me not understood the true beauty of hindu thought.</p>

<p>There is a Vaishnavite contribution to this too....</p>

<p>Very Simple Tamizh again. However I wouldn't look at it as a true <br />differentiation, but just an aberration due to the perspectives <br />prevalent. The loyalty of the Azhwar or the Abhirama Bhattar or <br />Sundarar was at extreme that they praised very high about the form <br />they loved. That is it? </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>      No need to explain the meaning as the Tamizh is very<br />      simple. Yes, you <br />      look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show<br />      himself as Siva, if <br />      you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as<br />      Vishnu. </p>
<p>      This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he<br />      was walking <br />      through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of<br />      Srirangam were <br />      playing with the sand, building a temple and on<br />      seeing Ramanuja <br />      called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this<br />      prasAdham of your <br />      beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately obeyed<br />      the kids and <br />      took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand, with<br />      utmost respect in <br />      the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the<br />      spot. He accepted <br />      the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This<br />      is what is <br />      glorified as bhAva suddhi. </p>
<p>      This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no true<br />      Srivaishnavite <br />      will disrespect another God.</p>

<p>        I remember reading a story on this, don't know<br />      where,<br />        possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.</p>
<p>        A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />        better, naamam or thiruneeru. The vaishavite wants<br />      to<br />        take down al lthe horizontal bricks from the house<br />        they are in in defence of the argument. The<br />      shaivite<br />        does the opposite and removes vertical. Finally<br />      there<br />        is no house left.</p>
<p>        This is a century old argument, and ridiculous<br />        argument in my opinion. Like the Annamarcharya<br />      kirtan<br />        rendered in MSS's melodious voice Entha maatramuna<br />        evvaaru thalachina antha mathrame neevu - whatever<br />        ways devotees seek you, you are that.</p>

<p>          Mr.Venketesh (vinjamoor_venketesh, this is<br />      getting<br />          crazy :) )<br />          You writings are very informative. Have you<br />      written<br />          in this group before? If<br />          so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do<br />      keep<br />          this going.<br />          If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />          seeing this topic the<br />          Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming (no<br />          offence, just a joke).<br />          This happens when my father and my family friend<br />          (the one i was talking<br />          about earlier) start having a chat about thier<br />      visit<br />          to the meenakshi<br />          temple. This family friend (im delibrately<br />          refraining from naming him)<br />          doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father,<br />      being<br />          a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />          we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement<br />      and it<br />          keeps continuing.<br />          For an arguement and topic which has been going<br />      on<br />          for more than 10<br />          centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.</p>
<p>          I just wanted to convey this, this is also a<br />      pretty<br />          sensitive topic hence i<br />          request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />          refrain from hurting<br />          another's feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />          openess of society we seem<br />          to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron<br />          hand is required so i<br />          request our moderators to keep a watch on these<br />          threads and mercilessy<br />          delete any mails which might seem offensive.</p>

<p>            The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a<br />      perennial<br />          debate going on<br />            between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />          thenkalais claim that<br />            vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not<br />      only<br />          after Ramanuja, but<br />            only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last<br />      acharya in<br />          the Guruparampara.<br />            The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai<br />      originated<br />          from Pillai<br />            Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala<br />      Mamunigal.</p>
<p>            This debate will never end as both are not<br />      ready<br />          to accept the<br />            other's views. Let us leave it at that.<br />      However,<br />          if one enters into a<br />            philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />          small writeup<br />            regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />          personal mails on that<br />            debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />          here. Ofcourse, it is<br />            subject to a debate.</p>
<p>            Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he<br />      lived<br />          for 120 years. He<br />            attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD.<br />      These<br />          are the timelines<br />            which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>            Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has<br />      no<br />          link to the<br />            Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />          happened later, though<br />            within the times of Ramanuja. And you are<br />      right in<br />          saying that<br />            Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />          from the sea and got<br />            it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not<br />      pretty<br />          sure, how he was<br />            reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />          somewhere (may be in<br />            this group itself) that He was reinstated<br />      during<br />          the times of Nayak<br />            kings much against the wishes of the<br />      Dikshitars of<br />          Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>            Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />          neither acting as<br />            Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the<br />      priest<br />          of the Temple of<br />            Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />          mention in the<br />            history.</p>

        <p>Smt Malathi,<br />Agreed, there cannot be another God.

He accepted <br />    the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This<br />    is what is <br />    glorified as bhAva suddhi. </p>
<p>    This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no true<br />    Srivaishnavite <br />    will disrespect another God.</p>

<p>        Mr.Venketesh (vinjamoor_venketesh, this is<br />    getting<br />        crazy :) )<br />        You writings are very informative. Have you<br />    written<br />        in this group before? If<br />        so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do<br />    keep<br />        this going.<br />        If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />        seeing this topic the<br />        Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming (no<br />        offence, just a joke).<br />        This happens when my father and my family friend<br />        (the one i was talking<br />        about earlier) start having a chat about thier<br />    visit<br />        to the meenakshi<br />        temple. This family friend (im delibrately<br />        refraining from naming him)<br />        doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father,<br />    being<br />        a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />        we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement<br />    and it<br />        keeps continuing.<br />        For an arguement and topic which has been going<br />    on<br />        for more than 10<br />        centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.</p>
<p>        I just wanted to convey this, this is also a<br />    pretty<br />        sensitive topic hence i<br />        request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />        refrain from hurting<br />        another's feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />        openess of society we seem<br />        to take too much of a liberty.

<p>          The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a<br />    perennial<br />        debate going on<br />          between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />        thenkalais claim that<br />          vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not<br />    only<br />        after Ramanuja, but<br />          only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last<br />    acharya in<br />        the Guruparampara.<br />          The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai<br />    originated<br />        from Pillai<br />          Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala<br />    Mamunigal.</p>
<p>          This debate will never end as both are not<br />    ready<br />        to accept the<br />          other's views. Let us leave it at that.<br />    However,<br />        if one enters into a<br />          philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />        small writeup<br />          regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />        personal mails on that<br />          debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />        here. Ofcourse, it is<br />          subject to a debate.</p>
<p>          Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he<br />    lived<br />        for 120 years. He<br />          attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD.<br />    These<br />        are the timelines<br />          which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>          Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has<br />    no<br />        link to the<br />          Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />        happened later, though<br />          within the times of Ramanuja. And you are<br />    right in<br />        saying that<br />          Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />        from the sea and got<br />          it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not<br />    pretty<br />        sure, how he was<br />          reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />        somewhere (may be in<br />          this group itself) that He was reinstated<br />    during<br />        the times of Nayak<br />          kings much against the wishes of the<br />    Dikshitars of<br />        Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>          Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />        neither acting as<br />          Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the<br />    priest<br />        of the Temple of<br />          Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />        mention in the<br />          history.</p>

<p>    No need to explain the meaning as the Tamizh is very simple. Yes, <br />  you <br />    look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show himself as <br />Siva, <br />  if <br />    you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as Vishnu. </p>
<p>    This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he was walking <br />    through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of Srirangam were <br />    playing with the sand, building a temple and on seeing Ramanuja <br />    called him and said " svAmin, come here.

<p>            Hi<br />            so many venkatesh's in the group now.</p>
<p>            i have seen the tatooing( or branding)<br />        instruments used on ramanuja<br />            himself(???) in mathuranthakam temple. they were<br />        discovered in a<br />            secret chamber in the last decade</p>
<p>            .     So if he still has taken such a<br />            scene<br />              like King asking Ramanuja instead of<br />        Koorathazhwan to recite the<br />              verses,</p>
<p>                This person im talking about also has the<br />        tatoo (or is it<br />          burned<br />              into the<br />                skin? Can somebody confirm this?) on his<br />        bicep.</p>
<p>            rahul , kamal also had a thenkalai naamam(<br />        straight lined like a<br />            trident rather than the U of vadakalai)</p>
<p>            but one doubt??<br />            didnt vadakalai originate after ramanuja??? then<br />        how does he do<br />          this<br />            say some 50 years prior?</p>
<p>            can sps clarify the timelines of</p>
<p>            a. ramanuja<br />            b. the chitrakootam incident of govindarajar and<br />        the sea dropping.</p>
<p>            isnt there a prevalent story that ramanuja<br />        recovered it and placed<br />            it in kizh tirupathi?????</p>

<p>            They are not<br />              allowed to have<br />                a moustache/beard too. But Kamal has both in<br />        that particular<br />            scene.<br />                I think its pretty hard to stick with the<br />        legend in the movie.<br />              Maybe Kamal<br />                just took the cusp and formed a creative<br />        story based on that.<br />          The<br />              movie<br />                should clear this up.</p>

        <p>SPS Sir,</p>
<p>The Chitrkoodam of Ramayana is neither the Thillai Vilaakam nor <br />Chidambaram. It is somewhere in Madhyapradesh. This is were Rama,Sita <br />and Lakshmana stayed for atleast 11 years before Sita was abducted by <br />Ravana. One can google and find many references to this place.</p>
<p>Azhwars never talk about Chidambaram being associated with <br />Thiruchitrakoodam where Rama had stayed. The the name for Chidambaram <br />as Thiruchithrakoodam is at best a co-incidence or namesake. And by <br />the above, Thillai Vilaagam stands no were near to be termed <br />Chithrakoodam of Ramayana fame, though the Rama idol was found there.</p>
<p>For the records, I had never visited Thillai Vilaagam.</p>

<p>    Dear SPs<br />    the perumal in chitra kootam( the vaishnavaite sector of thillai) <br />  was<br />    definitely removed</p>
<p>    a replacement was made during 16th or 17th centuries by a <br />  vaishnavite<br />    king of senji<br />    the second incident is well recorded</p>
<p>    trivia<br />    in protest against the re- installation of the vaishnava idol<br />    some saivaite dikshitars committed suicide by falling off the<br />    towers'<br />  ===============================<br />  Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  Had you been to Thillai vilagam near Vedaranyam / Tiruvarur?</p>
<p>  An ancient Ramar Bronze was found there about 80 yrs back and<br />  positioned in this temple ..</p>
<p>  There was a point raised for consideration based on this soemtime <br />  back:</p>
<p>  CHITRAKUDAM is related to Ramayana - where Ramar had a role to play?<br />  What Govindaraja was doing in Chitrakudam?</p>
<p>  Since Ramar was found in Thillaivilagam, there is possibility that<br />  Chitrakudam should have been Thillaivilagam - NOT IN CHIDAMBARAM - <br />  but<br />  bearing the same name near Tiruvarur / Vedaranyam!</p>
<p>  There are ayes and nos to this line of thinking !</p>
<p>  But no doubt Thillaivilagam Ramar is a Great Bronze - which has <br />small<br />  bells in the Dhanusu - reminding us of the one which created <br />  continuous<br />  ringning of bells for about one Muhurtham - when Rama destroyed<br />  Ravana's Moolabala Senai!</p>
<p>  The Lotus pond is reportedly nurturing SAHASRA IDHAZH LOTUS (1000<br />  idhazh konda Thamari) even today !</p>

<p>You have literally bombarded me with informations. I will try to <br />analyse the possibility of a Chola King being the reason behind <br />Ramanuja's exile. I request some time before I reply to this. I will <br />reply to this within a week's time.</p>

<p>    Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no link to the <br />    Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have happened later, <br />though <br />    within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in saying that <br />    Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam from the sea and <br />  got <br />    it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. <br />  ===============================</p>
<p>  Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  following extracts from the Archieves  <br />  (Earlier discussions in our Gp):</p>
<p>  behaved against the interest of Rev. St. Ramanujar /Srivaishnavam <br />is <br />  rejected.</p>
<p>  Our member Vijaykumar posted earlier the link ::</p>
<p>  Acknowledged Authority on Chozha History / State Archeology <br />Director <br />  (Retd) Dr Nagaswamy's interesting article on the legends <br />associated <br />  with Ramanujar and thence sri rangam....</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume4/articles/article11.x" title="http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume4/articles/article11.x">http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume4/articles/article11.x</a><br />  ml</p>
<p>  The study of Srngam epigraphs of the time of Kulothunga-I clearly<br />  and in unmistakable terms show the personal interest of the king in<br />  the temple, the devotion of the king , the queens and their<br />  endowments, the provisions for the recitation of Thiruvaimozhi<br />  twice in the same reign, the endowments of flower gardens, the <br />  reclamation<br />  of silted lands, institution of festivals etc., show a period of<br />  great activity in the temple, and its prosperous condition, which is<br />  totally at variance with the Ramanuja legend. </p>
<p>  As per the records the King , the queen and his officers have <br />  particpated with in every form<br />  of pious deed prescribed by the tredtion On the basis of this<br />  scientific study of the subject found in the actual contemporary<br />  records of the temple the story that Kulothunga I, was an<br />  antogonist of Vaishnavism and that he persecuted Ramanuja is a<br />  fiction of imagination, can not be sustained and must be rejected.</p>
<p>  (with References)</p>
<p>  ------------------------------------<br />  I have ADDED through my earlier mail in MSG 13499 posted on  <br />  01.09.2006 :</p>

<p>  2. NARASIMHA SWAMY WAS THE KULADEYVAM of KULOTHUNGA I ..... !<br />  ------------- as could be seen by ENNAYIRAM INSCRIPTION :</p>
<p>  KULOTHINGA's inscription in his 41st year which is VERY<br />  IMPORTANT :<br />  THRIBUVANACHAKRAVARTHIYIN K-U-L-A-D-E-Y-V-A-M-A-N-A AZHAGIYA<br />  NARASIMHA PERUMAL THIRUKKOIYILIL DEYVA PRADISTAIYUM,<br />  JALAPRADISTAIYUM SEYDARULINAR. HE performed this on the eve of<br />  commencing war against Kalingam !<br />  =================================<br />  This information is also furnished by<br />  Pacnahjanyam, Shree Vaishnavashree A. Krishnamachariar, Srirangam. <br />  ( Pls write to him to get details of Panchajanyam monthly issue.)</p>
<p>  Kulothunga I ruled from 1070 to 1122 AD with Vikramachozhan<br />  overlapping 1118 to 1135 AD. Vikrama's 13th year is AD 1130. There<br />  were grants almost every year and in 1140 AD there was a grant by<br />  Kulothunga II.as well.</p>
<p>  It is evidenced that during the 120 years of lifetime of Sri<br />  Ramanujar uninterruptedly Chozha dynasty has given grants to<br />  Srirangam temple as could be seen from more 120 inscriptions ..</p>
<p>  ENNAYIRAM : Our members are familiar with this place. On our trip<br />  to Thanjavur, we got down about 10 Km after Tindivanam and found a<br />  recent stone pointing the direction of Ennayiram :: Kavi<br />  Kalamegam's birth place. There are stories that 8000 Jains were<br />  put on Kazhu.</p>
<p>  Another story that Ashta Saharsra Brahmins hail from this place.<br />  however as desired by SARVA SIVA PNDITHAR - GURU OF RAJENDRA I - a<br />  Siva temple was constructed .. nearby place is Esalam where copper<br />  plates confirming that Aditha Karikalan put Veerpandian's head at<br />  the Fort Entrance of Thanjai was found about 20 years back...<br />  -------------------------<br />  " Pillailogam Jeeyar" in his "Ramanujarya Divya Satidhai"<br />  mentioned<br />  that Udayavar (Sri Ramanujar)has visited Thirumalai thrice and<br />  each time he did not fail to visit Thirukkaoilore "Idaikkazhi<br />  Naayanar".<br />  -----------------<br />  ENNAYIRATHU ECHCHAN a devotee of Udayavar was ordered certain<br />  disciplines : Washing THIRUPPARIYATTAM - clothings of Sree<br />  Viahsnavite devotees (like Meykandar - Sivanadiayar of Nallur! -<br />  Actor Nagesh did this role well in Thiruvilayadal movie).

<p>  the INSCRIPTIONAL RECORDS are CONTEMPORARY... Scribed in respective <br />  years .. Meaning Kulothunga I 's regime, Kulothunga II's regime etc.</p>
<p>  " The Guruparambara " details are certainly later to these ..</p>
<p>  PLS CONFIRM WHETHER THESE DETAILS PROVIDE THAT KULOTHUNGA WAS <br />  DEVOTEE OF NARASIMHA SWAMY WHICH WAS HIS KULA DEYVAM !</p>
<p>  We may have to reconsider several things in the light of the above.</p>

<p>      Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>      Very good words. Whatever form the devotee seeks He<br />      becomes the same. <br />      first Azhwar says</p>
<p>      thamar ugandhadhu evvuruvam, avvuruvam thAnE,<br />      thamar ugandhadhu eppEr maRRappEr,<br />      thamar ugandhu evvaNNam sindhitthu imayAdhirupparE<br />      avvaNNam AazhiyAnAm.</p>
<p>      (thamar - selfless devotees)</p>
<p>      No need to explain the meaning as the Tamizh is very<br />      simple. Yes, you <br />      look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show<br />      himself as Siva, if <br />      you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as<br />      Vishnu. </p>
<p>      This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he<br />      was walking <br />      through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of<br />      Srirangam were <br />      playing with the sand, building a temple and on<br />      seeing Ramanuja <br />      called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this<br />      prasAdham of your <br />      beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately obeyed<br />      the kids and <br />      took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand, with<br />      utmost respect in <br />      the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the<br />      spot. He accepted <br />      the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This<br />      is what is <br />      glorified as bhAva suddhi. </p>
<p>      This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no true<br />      Srivaishnavite <br />      will disrespect another God.</p>

<p>        I remember reading a story on this, don't know<br />      where,<br />        possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.</p>
<p>        A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />        better, naamam or thiruneeru. The vaishavite wants<br />      to<br />        take down al lthe horizontal bricks from the house<br />        they are in in defence of the argument. The<br />      shaivite<br />        does the opposite and removes vertical. Finally<br />      there<br />        is no house left.</p>
<p>        This is a century old argument, and ridiculous<br />        argument in my opinion.

<p>          Mr.Venketesh (vinjamoor_venketesh, this is<br />      getting<br />          crazy :) )<br />          You writings are very informative. Have you<br />      written<br />          in this group before? If<br />          so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do<br />      keep<br />          this going.<br />          If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />          seeing this topic the<br />          Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming (no<br />          offence, just a joke).<br />          This happens when my father and my family friend<br />          (the one i was talking<br />          about earlier) start having a chat about thier<br />      visit<br />          to the meenakshi<br />          temple. This family friend (im delibrately<br />          refraining from naming him)<br />          doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father,<br />      being<br />          a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />          we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement<br />      and it<br />          keeps continuing.<br />          For an arguement and topic which has been going<br />      on<br />          for more than 10<br />          centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.</p>
<p>          I just wanted to convey this, this is also a<br />      pretty<br />          sensitive topic hence i<br />          request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />          refrain from hurting<br />          another's feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />          openess of society we seem<br />          to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron<br />          hand is required so i<br />          request our moderators to keep a watch on these<br />          threads and mercilessy<br />          delete any mails which might seem offensive.</p>

<p>            The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a<br />      perennial<br />          debate going on<br />            between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />          thenkalais claim that<br />            vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not<br />      only<br />          after Ramanuja, but<br />            only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last<br />      acharya in<br />          the Guruparampara.<br />            The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai<br />      originated<br />          from Pillai<br />            Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala<br />      Mamunigal.</p>
<p>            This debate will never end as both are not<br />      ready<br />          to accept the<br />            other's views. Let us leave it at that.<br />      However,<br />          if one enters into a<br />            philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />          small writeup<br />            regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />          personal mails on that<br />            debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />          here. Ofcourse, it is<br />            subject to a debate.</p>
<p>            Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he<br />      lived<br />          for 120 years. He<br />            attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD.<br />      These<br />          are the timelines<br />            which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>            Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has<br />      no<br />          link to the<br />            Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />          happened later, though<br />            within the times of Ramanuja. And you are<br />      right in<br />          saying that<br />            Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />          from the sea and got<br />            it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not<br />      pretty<br />          sure, how he was<br />            reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />          somewhere (may be in<br />            this group itself) that He was reinstated<br />      during<br />          the times of Nayak<br />            kings much against the wishes of the<br />      Dikshitars of<br />          Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>            Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />          neither acting as<br />            Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the<br />      priest<br />          of the Temple of<br />            Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />          mention in the<br />            history.</p>

<p>    This is indeed my first post in this group. Ha Ha Ha.... The <br />    Vaishnavite in me screaming!!!! </p>
<p>  dear sps,</p>
<p>  Of the four major rulers of tamil land - atleast post kalabara <br />  period....most kings were shivites or atleast they built more <br />shiva <br />  temples ( venkat please correct me if i am wrong)....keeping this <br />is <br />  mind and the fact that both mal and shiva are not named in the <br />vedic <br />  hymns ( ok - no direct reference) - whereas indra ( indra vizha <br />  quoted in much detail in silapathigram ... govardhana giri episode <br />  arose due to the villagers displeasing indra...n he sent a hail <br />storm <br />  etc).... when and why did indra worship stop. the rest of the <br />hymns <br />  address the nature gods - incl agni, vayu, varuna etc..we have to <br />  accept that our religion has continually morphed itself. ( tks to <br />  rajini tiruvanaamalai is now a rediscovered - such a great history <br />  but it too was but forgotten ) - sakthi worship.....etc etc.</p>
<p>  But in my limited reading ( my personal opinion alone) one person <br />to <br />  whom i would credit the revival of hinduism in tamil land is <br />appar - <br />  if not for him maybe we would all be vijay jain, bhradwaj jain n <br />run <br />  pawn broking shops...just joking</p>
<p>  secondly - shiva temple contruction and iconogrpahic questions - <br />the <br />  lingothbhava icon n story - is irremovable from any shaivite <br />temple - <br />  the depiction belittles the other gods in the trinity - where and <br />why <br />  did the need to break away from the threesome arose ( poor brahma -</p>
<p>  he lost the race in india but still i supreme in thailand as pra <br />  phrom) and instead of portraying the lord slaying demons when did <br />  this competition arise - how do you expect a vaishnavite to come <br />  into a shiva temple with such standard fittings.</p>
<p>  take swamimalai - look at the thanthaikku upadesam gopuram <br />  sculpture - you will see mal offerring his respects to the the <br />father <br />  n son duo - another freeze has shiva ( a seated shiva) handing <br />over <br />  the sudarshana chakram to ( standing) vishnu - any anantha sayana <br />  freeze has shiva offering respects...looks like both sides vies <br />with <br />  each other - in almost childish exuberance - belittleing mals' <br />  tortoise avataram - in tirukachur you see him praying in his kacha <br />  form to the shiva lingam....the sarabeshwarar legend n idols....</p>
<p>  on the contrary early pallava for eg - in mallai - arjuna penance <br />  panel - u see an almost complete vishnu shrine ....why? why did <br />the <br />  shore temple jala sayana perumal be alongside the shiva temple - <br />but <br />  somewhere the competition started - in the early soma skanda <br />panels -<br />  the divine couple n skanda are flanked by flying gandarvas - but <br />  later depictions they morph into vishnu and brahma.... in kaanchi <br />  kailasantha temple - a prominent lingothbhavar comes up - in the <br />  natraja urdva thandavam - shiva is shown dancing with vishnu and <br />  brahma appreciating it .... we have already talked enough of chola <br />  temples...chera - few remain</p>
<p>  somewhere down this line things got so polarised and due to the <br />  presence of the dominant shivism ( atleast demographic size) the <br />  vaishnavites started feeling threatened and cocooned them into <br />going <br />  against the basic tenants of a polytheistic form instead taking it <br />  into a monotheistic base, whether its right or wrong - we must <br />agree <br />  that both versions - are not good for the basic structure of <br />  something as divine as the original version.</p>
<p>  though i do appreciate these rivalries for they created lot of bed <br />  time stories n sculptural beauties ..... they ( both sdies) have <br />to <br />  me not understood the true beauty of hindu thought.</p>

        <p>Venkat I don't disagree that Sambandar and Appar had<br />jains impaled. They lived in diferent times. There are<br />things we can accept about those times and things that<br />we cannot. Forget even about Sambandar and Appar if<br />you look at the gory exploits of our divine figures it<br />is not something we can digest in our time<br />and age.</p>
<p>Generally though when saint says his God is the only<br />way they mean what they have seen and experienced<br />spiritully that is all. The only way to expound such<br />experiences is by unilaterally asserting that it is<br />the only way - the 'only way' referred to by Christ<br />and pattar are the same 'only ways' just their<br />experience that is all.</p>
<p>If we study spiritual ecstasy in any culture and<br />tradition, it is not the path but the ultimate<br />experience it is the same that is why we believe it is<br />One. We can say there is no proof, and continue on the<br />lines of my God versus your God, that is not going to<br />lead anywhere other than everyone finishing one<br />another off, that is all.</p>

<p>      No need to explain the meaning as the Tamizh is very<br />      simple. Yes, you<br />      look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show<br />      himself as Siva, if<br />      you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as<br />      Vishnu.</p>
<p>      This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he<br />      was walking<br />      through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of<br />      Srirangam were<br />      playing with the sand, building a temple and on<br />      seeing Ramanuja<br />      called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this<br />      prasAdham of your<br />      beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately obeyed<br />      the kids and<br />      took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand, with<br />      utmost respect in<br />      the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the<br />      spot. He accepted<br />      the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This<br />      is what is<br />      glorified as bhAva suddhi.</p>
<p>      This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no true<br />      Srivaishnavite<br />      will disrespect another God.</p>

<p>        I remember reading a story on this, don't know<br />      where,<br />        possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.</p>
<p>        A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />        better, naamam or thiruneeru. The vaishavite wants<br />      to<br />        take down al lthe horizontal bricks from the house<br />        they are in in defence of the argument. The<br />      shaivite<br />        does the opposite and removes vertical. Finally<br />      there<br />        is no house left.</p>
<p>        This is a century old argument, and ridiculous<br />        argument in my opinion. Like the Annamarcharya<br />      kirtan<br />        rendered in MSS's melodious voice Entha maatramuna<br />        evvaaru thalachina antha mathrame neevu - whatever<br />        ways devotees seek you, you are that.</p>

Have you<br />      written<br />          in this group before? If<br />          so im sorry, i must have missed the mails.

This family friend (im delibrately<br />          refraining from naming him)<br />          doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father,<br />      being<br />          a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />          we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement<br />      and it<br />          keeps continuing.<br />          For an arguement and topic which has been going<br />      on<br />          for more than 10<br />          centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.</p>
<p>          I just wanted to convey this, this is also a<br />      pretty<br />          sensitive topic hence i<br />          request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />          refrain from hurting<br />          another's feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />          openess of society we seem<br />          to take too much of a liberty.

<p>            The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a<br />      perennial<br />          debate going on<br />            between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />          thenkalais claim that<br />            vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not<br />      only<br />          after Ramanuja, but<br />            only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last<br />      acharya in<br />          the Guruparampara.<br />            The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai<br />      originated<br />          from Pillai<br />            Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala<br />      Mamunigal.</p>
<p>            This debate will never end as both are not<br />      ready<br />          to accept the<br />            other's views. Let us leave it at that.<br />      However,<br />          if one enters into a<br />            philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />          small writeup<br />            regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />          personal mails on that<br />            debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />          here. Ofcourse, it is<br />            subject to a debate.</p>
<p>            Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he<br />      lived<br />          for 120 years. He<br />            attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD.<br />      These<br />          are the timelines<br />            which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>            Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has<br />      no<br />          link to the<br />            Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />          happened later, though<br />            within the times of Ramanuja. And you are<br />      right in<br />          saying that<br />            Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />          from the sea and got<br />            it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not<br />      pretty<br />          sure, how he was<br />            reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />          somewhere (may be in<br />            this group itself) that He was reinstated<br />      during<br />          the times of Nayak<br />            kings much against the wishes of the<br />      Dikshitars of<br />          Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>            Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />          neither acting as<br />            Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the<br />      priest<br />          of the Temple of<br />            Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />          mention in the<br />            history.</p>

<p>    Very good words. Whatever form the devotee seeks He<br />    becomes the same. <br />    first Azhwar says</p>

<p>    No need to explain the meaning as the Tamizh is very<br />    simple. Yes, you <br />    look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show<br />    himself as Siva, if <br />    you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as<br />    Vishnu. </p>
<p>    This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he<br />    was walking <br />    through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of<br />    Srirangam were <br />    playing with the sand, building a temple and on<br />    seeing Ramanuja <br />    called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this<br />    prasAdham of your <br />    beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately obeyed<br />    the kids and <br />    took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand, with<br />    utmost respect in <br />    the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the<br />    spot. He accepted <br />    the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This<br />    is what is <br />    glorified as bhAva suddhi. </p>
<p>    This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no true<br />    Srivaishnavite <br />    will disrespect another God.</p>

<p>      I remember reading a story on this, don't know<br />    where,<br />      possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.</p>
<p>      A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />      better, naamam or thiruneeru. The vaishavite wants<br />    to<br />      take down al lthe horizontal bricks from the house<br />      they are in in defence of the argument. The<br />    shaivite<br />      does the opposite and removes vertical. Finally<br />    there<br />      is no house left.</p>
<p>      This is a century old argument, and ridiculous<br />      argument in my opinion. Like the Annamarcharya<br />    kirtan<br />      rendered in MSS's melodious voice Entha maatramuna<br />      evvaaru thalachina antha mathrame neevu - whatever<br />      ways devotees seek you, you are that.</p>

<p>        Mr.Venketesh (vinjamoor_venketesh, this is<br />    getting<br />        crazy :) )<br />        You writings are very informative. Have you<br />    written<br />        in this group before? If<br />        so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do<br />    keep<br />        this going.<br />        If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />        seeing this topic the<br />        Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming (no<br />        offence, just a joke).<br />        This happens when my father and my family friend<br />        (the one i was talking<br />        about earlier) start having a chat about thier<br />    visit<br />        to the meenakshi<br />        temple. This family friend (im delibrately<br />        refraining from naming him)<br />        doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father,<br />    being<br />        a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />        we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement<br />    and it<br />        keeps continuing.<br />        For an arguement and topic which has been going<br />    on<br />        for more than 10<br />        centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.</p>
<p>        I just wanted to convey this, this is also a<br />    pretty<br />        sensitive topic hence i<br />        request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />        refrain from hurting<br />        another's feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />        openess of society we seem<br />        to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron<br />        hand is required so i<br />        request our moderators to keep a watch on these<br />        threads and mercilessy<br />        delete any mails which might seem offensive.</p>

<p>          The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a<br />    perennial<br />        debate going on<br />          between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />        thenkalais claim that<br />          vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not<br />    only<br />        after Ramanuja, but<br />          only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last<br />    acharya in<br />        the Guruparampara.<br />          The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai<br />    originated<br />        from Pillai<br />          Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala<br />    Mamunigal.</p>
<p>          This debate will never end as both are not<br />    ready<br />        to accept the<br />          other's views. Let us leave it at that.<br />    However,<br />        if one enters into a<br />          philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />        small writeup<br />          regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />        personal mails on that<br />          debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />        here. Ofcourse, it is<br />          subject to a debate.</p>
<p>          Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he<br />    lived<br />        for 120 years. He<br />          attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD.<br />    These<br />        are the timelines<br />          which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>          Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has<br />    no<br />        link to the<br />          Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />        happened later, though<br />          within the times of Ramanuja. And you are<br />    right in<br />        saying that<br />          Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />        from the sea and got<br />          it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not<br />    pretty<br />        sure, how he was<br />          reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />        somewhere (may be in<br />          this group itself) that He was reinstated<br />    during<br />        the times of Nayak<br />          kings much against the wishes of the<br />    Dikshitars of<br />        Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>          Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />        neither acting as<br />          Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the<br />    priest<br />        of the Temple of<br />          Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />        mention in the<br />          history.</p>

<p>  As far as Vaishavites take 'offence' at depiction of<br />  mal in sculptures etc, that somehow to me adds up to<br />  what Mal means to the person. God is beyond such<br />  petty<br />  offences, He whether you see him as Mal or Shiva is<br />  the embodiment of compassion, He is not standing for<br />  election and not expecting his devotees/followers to<br />  save him from insults. As a vaishavite myself I<br />  would<br />  just look at it as the sculptor's perspective that<br />  is<br />  all.</p>
<p>  The late D.K. Jayaraman, brother of veteran singer<br />  D.K. Pattamal had a song in one of his albums - I<br />  forget the author of the song, but it went like<br />  Hariyum Haranum Onre endru ariyadavar ularo...<br />  Jayaraman used to end the song on humorous note<br />  'Oooh<br />  oru silar ularae'...</p>

<p>      This is indeed my first post in this group. Ha<br />  Ha<br />    Ha.... The <br />      Vaishnavite in me screaming!!!! </p>
<p>    dear sps,</p>
<p>    Of the four major rulers of tamil land - atleast<br />    post kalabara <br />    period....most kings were shivites or atleast they<br />    built more shiva <br />    temples ( venkat please correct me if i am<br />    wrong)....keeping this is <br />    mind and the fact that both mal and shiva are not<br />    named in the vedic <br />    hymns ( ok - no direct reference) - whereas indra<br />  (<br />    indra vizha <br />    quoted in much detail in silapathigram ...<br />    govardhana giri episode <br />    arose due to the villagers displeasing indra...n<br />  he<br />    sent a hail storm <br />    etc).... when and why did indra worship stop. the<br />    rest of the hymns <br />    address the nature gods - incl agni, vayu, varuna<br />    etc..we have to <br />    accept that our religion has continually morphed<br />    itself. ( tks to <br />    rajini tiruvanaamalai is now a rediscovered - such<br />  a<br />    great history <br />    but it too was but forgotten ) - sakthi<br />    worship.....etc etc.</p>
<p>    But in my limited reading ( my personal opinion<br />    alone) one person to <br />    whom i would credit the revival of hinduism in<br />  tamil<br />    land is appar - <br />    if not for him maybe we would all be vijay jain,<br />    bhradwaj jain n run <br />    pawn broking shops...just joking</p>
<p>    secondly - shiva temple contruction and<br />  iconogrpahic<br />    questions - the <br />    lingothbhava icon n story - is irremovable from<br />  any<br />    shaivite temple - <br />    the depiction belittles the other gods in the<br />    trinity - where and why <br />    did the need to break away from the threesome<br />  arose<br />    ( poor brahma - <br />    he lost the race in india but still i supreme in<br />    thailand as pra <br />    phrom) and instead of portraying the lord slaying<br />    demons when did <br />    this competition arise - how do you expect a<br />    vaishnavite to come <br />    into a shiva temple with such standard fittings.</p>
<p>    take swamimalai - look at the thanthaikku<br />  upadesam<br />    gopuram <br />    sculpture - you will see mal offerring his<br />  respects<br />    to the the father <br />    n son duo - another freeze has shiva ( a seated<br />    shiva) handing over <br />    the sudarshana chakram to ( standing) vishnu - any<br />    anantha sayana <br />    freeze has shiva offering respects...looks like<br />  both<br />    sides vies with <br />    each other - in almost childish exuberance -<br />    belittleing mals' <br />    tortoise avataram - in tirukachur you see him<br />    praying in his kacha <br />    form to the shiva lingam....the sarabeshwarar<br />  legend<br />    n idols....</p>
<p>    on the contrary early pallava for eg - in mallai -<br />    arjuna penance <br />    panel - u see an almost complete vishnu shrine<br />    ....why? why did the <br />    shore temple jala sayana perumal be alongside the<br />    shiva temple - but <br />    somewhere the competition started - in the early<br />    soma skanda panels -<br />    the divine couple n skanda are flanked by flying<br />    gandarvas - but <br />    later depictions they morph into vishnu and<br />    brahma.... in kaanchi <br />    kailasantha temple - a prominent lingothbhavar<br />  comes<br />    up - in the <br />    natraja urdva thandavam - shiva is shown dancing<br />    with vishnu and <br />    brahma appreciating it .... we have already talked<br />    enough of chola <br />    temples...chera - few remain</p>
<p>    somewhere down this line things got so polarised<br />  and<br />    due to the <br />    presence of the dominant shivism ( atleast<br />    demographic size) the <br />    vaishnavites started feeling threatened and<br />  cocooned<br />    them into going <br />    against the basic tenants of a polytheistic form<br />    instead taking it <br />    into a monotheistic base, whether its right or<br />  wrong<br />    - we must agree <br />    that both versions - are not good for the basic<br />    structure of <br />    something as divine as the original version.</p>
<p>    though i do appreciate these rivalries for they<br />    created lot of bed <br />    time stories n sculptural beauties ..... they (<br />    both sdies) have to <br />    me not understood the true beauty of hindu<br />  thought.</p>

        <p>Venkat II, very well said tht both versions are not in<br />league with the original beauty of hindu thought.</p>
<p>As far as Vaishavites take 'offence' at depiction of<br />mal in sculptures etc, that somehow to me adds up to<br />what Mal means to the person. God is beyond such petty<br />offences, He whether you see him as Mal or Shiva is<br />the embodiment of compassion, He is not standing for<br />election and not expecting his devotees/followers to<br />save him from insults. As a vaishavite myself I would<br />just look at it as the sculptor's perspective that is<br />all.</p>
<p>The late D.K. Jayaraman, brother of veteran singer<br />D.K. Pattamal had a song in one of his albums - I<br />forget the author of the song, but it went like<br />Hariyum Haranum Onre endru ariyadavar ularo...<br />Jayaraman used to end the song on humorous note 'Oooh<br />oru silar ularae'...</p>

<p>    Mr Rahul,</p>
<p>    This is indeed my first post in this group. Ha Ha<br />  Ha.... The <br />    Vaishnavite in me screaming!!!! </p>
<p>  dear sps,</p>
<p>  Of the four major rulers of tamil land - atleast<br />  post kalabara <br />  period....most kings were shivites or atleast they<br />  built more shiva <br />  temples ( venkat please correct me if i am<br />  wrong)....keeping this is <br />  mind and the fact that both mal and shiva are not<br />  named in the vedic <br />  hymns ( ok - no direct reference) - whereas indra (<br />  indra vizha <br />  quoted in much detail in silapathigram ...<br />  govardhana giri episode <br />  arose due to the villagers displeasing indra...n he<br />  sent a hail storm <br />  etc).... when and why did indra worship stop. the<br />  rest of the hymns <br />  address the nature gods - incl agni, vayu, varuna<br />  etc..we have to <br />  accept that our religion has continually morphed<br />  itself. ( tks to <br />  rajini tiruvanaamalai is now a rediscovered - such a<br />  great history <br />  but it too was but forgotten ) - sakthi<br />  worship.....etc etc.</p>
<p>  But in my limited reading ( my personal opinion<br />  alone) one person to <br />  whom i would credit the revival of hinduism in tamil<br />  land is appar - <br />  if not for him maybe we would all be vijay jain,<br />  bhradwaj jain n run <br />  pawn broking shops...just joking</p>
<p>  secondly - shiva temple contruction and iconogrpahic<br />  questions - the <br />  lingothbhava icon n story - is irremovable from any<br />  shaivite temple - <br />  the depiction belittles the other gods in the<br />  trinity - where and why <br />  did the need to break away from the threesome arose<br />  ( poor brahma - <br />  he lost the race in india but still i supreme in<br />  thailand as pra <br />  phrom) and instead of portraying the lord slaying<br />  demons when did <br />  this competition arise - how do you expect a<br />  vaishnavite to come <br />  into a shiva temple with such standard fittings.</p>
<p>  take swamimalai - look at the thanthaikku upadesam<br />  gopuram <br />  sculpture - you will see mal offerring his respects<br />  to the the father <br />  n son duo - another freeze has shiva ( a seated<br />  shiva) handing over <br />  the sudarshana chakram to ( standing) vishnu - any<br />  anantha sayana <br />  freeze has shiva offering respects...looks like both<br />  sides vies with <br />  each other - in almost childish exuberance -<br />  belittleing mals' <br />  tortoise avataram - in tirukachur you see him<br />  praying in his kacha <br />  form to the shiva lingam....the sarabeshwarar legend<br />  n idols....</p>
<p>  on the contrary early pallava for eg - in mallai -<br />  arjuna penance <br />  panel - u see an almost complete vishnu shrine<br />  ....why? why did the <br />  shore temple jala sayana perumal be alongside the<br />  shiva temple - but <br />  somewhere the competition started - in the early<br />  soma skanda panels -<br />  the divine couple n skanda are flanked by flying<br />  gandarvas - but <br />  later depictions they morph into vishnu and<br />  brahma.... in kaanchi <br />  kailasantha temple - a prominent lingothbhavar comes<br />  up - in the <br />  natraja urdva thandavam - shiva is shown dancing<br />  with vishnu and <br />  brahma appreciating it .... we have already talked<br />  enough of chola <br />  temples...chera - few remain</p>
<p>  somewhere down this line things got so polarised and<br />  due to the <br />  presence of the dominant shivism ( atleast<br />  demographic size) the <br />  vaishnavites started feeling threatened and cocooned<br />  them into going <br />  against the basic tenants of a polytheistic form<br />  instead taking it <br />  into a monotheistic base, whether its right or wrong<br />  - we must agree <br />  that both versions - are not good for the basic<br />  structure of <br />  something as divine as the original version.</p>
<p>  though i do appreciate these rivalries for they<br />  created lot of bed <br />  time stories n sculptural beauties ..... they (<br />  both sdies) have to <br />  me not understood the true beauty of hindu thought.</p>

        <p>Satish, how can you not mean 'anything', we all mean<br />something dont' we :))? I did not read between lines,<br />only quoted what you said.</p>
<p>I will confess my weakness too, I hate being too soft<br />on these age old divisionary arguments, basically all<br />is one, leave it at that, that is all. If we try to<br />argue on those lines it is just an attempt to dilute<br />that stance.</p>

<p>  No need to explain the meaning as the Tamizh is very<br />  simple. Yes, you <br />  look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show<br />  himself as Siva, if <br />  you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as<br />  Vishnu. </p>
<p>  This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he<br />  was walking <br />  through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of<br />  Srirangam were <br />  playing with the sand, building a temple and on<br />  seeing Ramanuja <br />  called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this<br />  prasAdham of your <br />  beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately obeyed<br />  the kids and <br />  took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand, with<br />  utmost respect in <br />  the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the<br />  spot. He accepted <br />  the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This<br />  is what is <br />  glorified as bhAva suddhi. </p>
<p>  This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no true<br />  Srivaishnavite <br />  will disrespect another God.</p>

<p>    I remember reading a story on this, don't know<br />  where,<br />    possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.</p>
<p>    A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />    better, naamam or thiruneeru. The vaishavite wants<br />  to<br />    take down al lthe horizontal bricks from the house<br />    they are in in defence of the argument. The<br />  shaivite<br />    does the opposite and removes vertical. Finally<br />  there<br />    is no house left.</p>
<p>    This is a century old argument, and ridiculous<br />    argument in my opinion. Like the Annamarcharya<br />  kirtan<br />    rendered in MSS's melodious voice Entha maatramuna<br />    evvaaru thalachina antha mathrame neevu - whatever<br />    ways devotees seek you, you are that.</p>

<p>      Mr.Venketesh (vinjamoor_venketesh, this is<br />  getting<br />      crazy :) )<br />      You writings are very informative. Have you<br />  written<br />      in this group before? If<br />      so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do<br />  keep<br />      this going.<br />      If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />      seeing this topic the<br />      Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming (no<br />      offence, just a joke).<br />      This happens when my father and my family friend<br />      (the one i was talking<br />      about earlier) start having a chat about thier<br />  visit<br />      to the meenakshi<br />      temple. This family friend (im delibrately<br />      refraining from naming him)<br />      doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father,<br />  being<br />      a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />      we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement<br />  and it<br />      keeps continuing.<br />      For an arguement and topic which has been going<br />  on<br />      for more than 10<br />      centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.</p>
<p>      I just wanted to convey this, this is also a<br />  pretty<br />      sensitive topic hence i<br />      request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />      refrain from hurting<br />      another's feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />      openess of society we seem<br />      to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron<br />      hand is required so i<br />      request our moderators to keep a watch on these<br />      threads and mercilessy<br />      delete any mails which might seem offensive.</p>

<p>        The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a<br />  perennial<br />      debate going on<br />        between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />      thenkalais claim that<br />        vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not<br />  only<br />      after Ramanuja, but<br />        only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last<br />  acharya in<br />      the Guruparampara.<br />        The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai<br />  originated<br />      from Pillai<br />        Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala<br />  Mamunigal.</p>
<p>        This debate will never end as both are not<br />  ready<br />      to accept the<br />        other's views. Let us leave it at that.<br />  However,<br />      if one enters into a<br />        philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />      small writeup<br />        regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />      personal mails on that<br />        debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />      here. Ofcourse, it is<br />        subject to a debate.</p>
<p>        Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he<br />  lived<br />      for 120 years. He<br />        attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD.<br />  These<br />      are the timelines<br />        which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>        Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has<br />  no<br />      link to the<br />        Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />      happened later, though<br />        within the times of Ramanuja. And you are<br />  right in<br />      saying that<br />        Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />      from the sea and got<br />        it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not<br />  pretty<br />      sure, how he was<br />        reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />      somewhere (may be in<br />        this group itself) that He was reinstated<br />  during<br />      the times of Nayak<br />        kings much against the wishes of the<br />  Dikshitars of<br />      Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>        Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />      neither acting as<br />        Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the<br />  priest<br />      of the Temple of<br />        Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />      mention in the<br />        history.</p>

<p>  No need to explain the meaning as the Tamizh is very simple. Yes, <br />you <br />  look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show himself as Siva, <br />if <br />  you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as Vishnu. </p>
<p>  This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he was walking <br />  through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of Srirangam were <br />  playing with the sand, building a temple and on seeing Ramanuja <br />  called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this prasAdham of <br />your <br />  beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately obeyed the kids and <br />  took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand, with utmost respect <br />in <br />  the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the spot. He accepted <br />  the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This is what is <br />  glorified as bhAva suddhi. </p>
<p>  This is why I wrote in my previous mail that no true <br />Srivaishnavite <br />  will disrespect another God.</p>

<p>    I remember reading a story on this, don't know where,<br />    possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.</p>
<p>    A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />    better, naamam or thiruneeru. The vaishavite wants to<br />    take down al lthe horizontal bricks from the house<br />    they are in in defence of the argument. The shaivite<br />    does the opposite and removes vertical. Finally there<br />    is no house left.</p>
<p>    This is a century old argument, and ridiculous<br />    argument in my opinion. Like the Annamarcharya kirtan<br />    rendered in MSS's melodious voice Entha maatramuna<br />    evvaaru thalachina antha mathrame neevu - whatever<br />    ways devotees seek you, you are that.</p>

<p>      Mr.Venketesh (vinjamoor_venketesh, this is getting<br />      crazy :) )<br />      You writings are very informative. Have you written<br />      in this group before? If<br />      so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do keep<br />      this going.<br />      If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />      seeing this topic the<br />      Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming (no<br />      offence, just a joke).<br />      This happens when my father and my family friend<br />      (the one i was talking<br />      about earlier) start having a chat about thier visit<br />      to the meenakshi<br />      temple. This family friend (im delibrately<br />      refraining from naming him)<br />      doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father, being<br />      a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />      we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement and it<br />      keeps continuing.<br />      For an arguement and topic which has been going on<br />      for more than 10<br />      centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.</p>
<p>      I just wanted to convey this, this is also a pretty<br />      sensitive topic hence i<br />      request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />      refrain from hurting<br />      another's feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />      openess of society we seem<br />      to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron<br />      hand is required so i<br />      request our moderators to keep a watch on these<br />      threads and mercilessy<br />      delete any mails which might seem offensive.</p>

<p>        The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial<br />      debate going on<br />        between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />      thenkalais claim that<br />        vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only<br />      after Ramanuja, but<br />        only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in<br />      the Guruparampara.<br />        The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated<br />      from Pillai<br />        Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.</p>
<p>        This debate will never end as both are not ready<br />      to accept the<br />        other's views. Let us leave it at that. However,<br />      if one enters into a<br />        philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />      small writeup<br />        regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />      personal mails on that<br />        debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />      here. Ofcourse, it is<br />        subject to a debate.</p>
<p>        Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived<br />      for 120 years. He<br />        attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These<br />      are the timelines<br />        which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>        Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no<br />      link to the<br />        Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />      happened later, though<br />        within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in<br />      saying that<br />        Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />      from the sea and got<br />        it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty<br />      sure, how he was<br />        reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />      somewhere (may be in<br />        this group itself) that He was reinstated during<br />      the times of Nayak<br />        kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of<br />      Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>        Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />      neither acting as<br />        Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest<br />      of the Temple of<br />        Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />      mention in the<br />        history.</p>

<p>          Hi<br />          so many venkatesh's in the group now.</p>
<p>          i have seen the tatooing( or branding)<br />      instruments used on ramanuja<br />          himself(???) in mathuranthakam temple. they were<br />      discovered in a<br />          secret chamber in the last decade</p>
<p>          .     So if he still has taken such a<br />          scene<br />            like King asking Ramanuja instead of<br />      Koorathazhwan to recite the<br />            verses,</p>
<p>              This person im talking about also has the<br />      tatoo (or is it<br />        burned<br />            into the<br />              skin? Can somebody confirm this?) on his<br />      bicep.</p>
<p>          rahul , kamal also had a thenkalai naamam(<br />      straight lined like a<br />          trident rather than the U of vadakalai)</p>
<p>          but one doubt??<br />          didnt vadakalai originate after ramanuja??? then<br />      how does he do<br />        this<br />          say some 50 years prior?</p>
<p>          can sps clarify the timelines of</p>
<p>          a. ramanuja<br />          b. the chitrakootam incident of govindarajar and<br />      the sea dropping.</p>
<p>          isnt there a prevalent story that ramanuja<br />      recovered it and placed<br />          it in kizh tirupathi?????</p>
<p>          venketesh</p>
<p>          They are not<br />            allowed to have<br />              a moustache/beard too. But Kamal has both in<br />      that particular<br />          scene.<br />              I think its pretty hard to stick with the<br />      legend in the movie.<br />            Maybe Kamal<br />              just took the cusp and formed a creative<br />      story based on that.<br />        The<br />            movie<br />              should clear this up.</p>

        <p>Forget about Vaishnavite and Saivite. Even within vaishnavite,<br />acharyas devoted to Rama would never go to Krishna temple and vice<br />versa.

Not a disrespect to Rama or Krishna.</p>
<p>For eg., One of Panduranga's leela is to pull Ramadasar (Guru of King<br />Sivaji). Ramadasar never visited krishna's temple due to his Ananya<br />bhakthi and Pandurangan wanted to see him ONLY because of that.</p>

        <p>Mr Sathish,</p>
<p>I am giving my two cents worth below.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "SatishKumar Arunachalam" <br /><satisharun@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Very informative discussions and quite interesting.</p>
<p>  The marking of sanku and chakkaram...I think they call it also <br />as 'deekshai'.. am i right?</p>
<p>  Its good to know that reason for people not going to Siva temple <br />just because of the <br />  loyalty and nothing else. Is this applicable to people only who <br />take deeksha or all the <br />  vaishnavites?</p></blockquote>
<p>The bonding takes places, literally after the dheekshai or <br />samAshrayaNam. However as a practice since the elders do not go, the <br />young ones too follow. It is but natural for the kids to emulate <br />their elders, isn't it.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p> why I am asking this is,people who dont take deekshai also dont go <br />to siva <br />  temple. This is not generalized as I know iyengars generously <br />participating in siva <br />  worship. But there are other kind of people too.... recently a <br />group of iyengars went on a <br />  trip to Badri but they didnt go to Kedar. I really appreciated <br />their devotion but at the same <br />  time wondering how can they do it? As discussed, its upto the <br />individual preference and <br />  should not be questions.So lets leave it there.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only reason, definitely is as I said earlier. The loyalty in <br />relationship.</p></satisharun@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  In PS Kalki says that saivam and vaishnavam was not like the <br />current day practice, where a <br />  family will be totally saivam or vaishnavam..A person can be a <br />strong saivite, and his <br />  brother can be a staunch viashnavite.. But later days it changed. I <br />think its true.</p></blockquote>
<p>This observation of Kalki is very correct. I will reply on this more <br />with the smArtha episode below.</p>
<blockquote><p>  We know a family where one is a saivite and his co-brother was a <br />vaishnavite. when we <br />  built a temple in our area in 1993, when the saivite donated the <br />whole shrine of Siva, just <br />  for competition his co-brother said he will build the entire vishnu <br />shrine. this competition <br />  helped the area vasis ultimately :)</p>
<p>  Also, there is an understanding that in brahmins iyers are saivites <br />and iyengars are <br />  vaishnavites. Iyengars being vaishnavites is accepted. But iyers <br />being saivites is not.<br />  Kanchi maha periyava clarified that people who follow sanakara <br />bagavad padal (those who <br />  are considered to be saivites) are not saivites, but smarthas.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Kanchi periyavaa is right. The followers of Sankaracharya <br />are termed Smarthas, though by and large they adorn the Saivite <br />symbols. And as you said correctly, according to advaitham, there is <br />no supremity of one God over the other. That is why you see many <br />Iyers worshipping both Siva and Vishnu equally, though the emphasis <br />is more on Siva. This answers the question above too.</p>
<blockquote><p>  smartha means those who accept advaitam and in advaitam there is no <br />supremacy of one <br />  god over other. so there is no question of following siva or vishnu <br />and consider all the <br />  gods are ONE.</p>
<p>  But the current day understanding is quite different. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the times are changing and so are the understanding.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Coming back to Dasavatharam, given the hype I am very much eager to <br />watch this. It <br />  should not sothapify as any other kamal movie which comes with a <br />hype.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Satish</p>

        <p>Respected SPS sir,</p>
<p>The Guruparampara Prabhavam is said to have been compiled sometime <br />after the demise of Ramanuja. I vaguely remember it was Pinbazhagiya <br />Perumal Jeeyar, a third generation disciple of Ramanuja.</p>
<p>Ramanuja<br />l<br />l<br />Parasara Bhattar<br />l<br />l<br />Nanjeeyar<br />l<br />l<br />Nampillai<br />l<br />l<br />Pinbazhagiya Perumal Jeeyar.</p>
<p>The tree will clarify this. But remember all the above AchAryAs upto <br />Nanjeeyar lived along with Ramanuja. Nampillai and Pinbazhagiya <br />Perumal Jeeyar were contemporaries though the latter was a disciple <br />of the former. I will throw more light on this, regarding the <br />timelines shortly. Kindly bear with me.</p>

<p>No need to explain the meaning as the Tamizh is very simple. Yes, you <br />look upon the Supreme Being as Siva, He will show himself as Siva, if <br />you look upon Him as Vishnu, He will show himself as Vishnu. </p>
<p>This is glorified by Ramanuja himself. Once when he was walking <br />through the Kaveri Banks in Srirangam, the kids of Srirangam were <br />playing with the sand, building a temple and on seeing Ramanuja <br />called him and said " svAmin, come here. Take this prasAdham of your <br />beloved PerumAL". This noble man, immediately obeyed the kids and <br />took the prasAdham, which is nothing but sand, with utmost respect in <br />the angavasthram and paid obeisance and left the spot. He accepted <br />the sand as both Ranganatha and His prasAdham. This is what is <br />glorified as bhAva suddhi. </p>

<p>    Mr.Venketesh (vinjamoor_venketesh, this is getting<br />    crazy :) )<br />    You writings are very informative. Have you written<br />    in this group before? If<br />    so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do keep<br />    this going.<br />    If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />    seeing this topic the<br />    Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming (no<br />    offence, just a joke).<br />    This happens when my father and my family friend<br />    (the one i was talking<br />    about earlier) start having a chat about thier visit<br />    to the meenakshi<br />    temple. This family friend (im delibrately<br />    refraining from naming him)<br />    doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father, being<br />    a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />    we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement and it<br />    keeps continuing.<br />    For an arguement and topic which has been going on<br />    for more than 10<br />    centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.</p>
<p>    I just wanted to convey this, this is also a pretty<br />    sensitive topic hence i<br />    request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />    refrain from hurting<br />    another's feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />    openess of society we seem<br />    to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron<br />    hand is required so i<br />    request our moderators to keep a watch on these<br />    threads and mercilessy<br />    delete any mails which might seem offensive.</p>

<p>      Mr Venketesh</p>
<p>      The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial<br />    debate going on<br />      between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />    thenkalais claim that<br />      vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only<br />    after Ramanuja, but<br />      only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in<br />    the Guruparampara.<br />      The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated<br />    from Pillai<br />      Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.</p>
<p>      This debate will never end as both are not ready<br />    to accept the<br />      other's views. Let us leave it at that. However,<br />    if one enters into a<br />      philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />    small writeup<br />      regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />    personal mails on that<br />      debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />    here. Ofcourse, it is<br />      subject to a debate.</p>
<p>      Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived<br />    for 120 years. He<br />      attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These<br />    are the timelines<br />      which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>      Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no<br />    link to the<br />      Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />    happened later, though<br />      within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in<br />    saying that<br />      Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />    from the sea and got<br />      it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty<br />    sure, how he was<br />      reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />    somewhere (may be in<br />      this group itself) that He was reinstated during<br />    the times of Nayak<br />      kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of<br />    Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>      Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />    neither acting as<br />      Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest<br />    of the Temple of<br />      Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />    mention in the<br />      history.</p>

<p>        Hi<br />        so many venkatesh's in the group now.</p>
<p>        i have seen the tatooing( or branding)<br />    instruments used on ramanuja<br />        himself(???) in mathuranthakam temple. they were<br />    discovered in a<br />        secret chamber in the last decade</p>
<p>        .     So if he still has taken such a<br />        scene<br />          like King asking Ramanuja instead of<br />    Koorathazhwan to recite the<br />          verses,</p>
<p>            This person im talking about also has the<br />    tatoo (or is it<br />      burned<br />          into the<br />            skin? Can somebody confirm this?) on his<br />    bicep.</p>
<p>        rahul , kamal also had a thenkalai naamam(<br />    straight lined like a<br />        trident rather than the U of vadakalai)</p>
<p>        but one doubt??<br />        didnt vadakalai originate after ramanuja??? then<br />    how does he do<br />      this<br />        say some 50 years prior?</p>
<p>        can sps clarify the timelines of</p>
<p>        a. ramanuja<br />        b. the chitrakootam incident of govindarajar and<br />    the sea dropping.</p>
<p>        isnt there a prevalent story that ramanuja<br />    recovered it and placed<br />        it in kizh tirupathi?????</p>
<p>        venketesh</p>
<p>        They are not<br />          allowed to have<br />            a moustache/beard too. But Kamal has both in<br />    that particular<br />        scene.<br />            I think its pretty hard to stick with the<br />    legend in the movie.<br />          Maybe Kamal<br />            just took the cusp and formed a creative<br />    story based on that.<br />      The<br />          movie<br />            should clear this up.</p>

        <p>Mr Rahul,</p>
<p>This is indeed my first post in this group. Ha Ha Ha.... The <br />Vaishnavite in me screaming!!!! Hey, definitely it is not. All along <br />I have observed the valuable contribution of others on History of TN <br />here. I would contribute only on the subject that I know. Since I <br />knew very less or nothing about the history (Honestly, only <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  <br />created the interest in History on me) I was a silent observer. As <br />you observed correctly, since the topic was about something the I <br />knew I contributed. So please do not conclude that I know much. And <br />no sorries please. I understand your intention and no ill feelings.</acronym></p>
<p>In fact I know that there is a widespread belief about the Iyengars <br />being Fanatic in that they wont go to Siva Temple. This is just <br />misrepresented and that is why I tried to clarify the reason why the <br />Iyengars do not go to Siva Temples. Honestly, I have been to Siva <br />temples, but let me admit that I dont pray there. Another refuge <br />under Nammazhwar. He says in his Thiruvaimozhi </p>
<p>....koLLak kuRaivilan, vEndiRRu ellAm tharum kOdhil en maNivaNNan....</p>
<p>He says that Vishnu is capable of giving all that one wants, in the <br />spirit of the same philosophy (husband-wife bhAvam) that I wrote <br />before. </p>
<p>This is what is called harmony. I may believe in a God and stick to <br />Him. But I will never defame another God. I may not pray to Him. That <br />doesn't mean I disrespect Him. Exactly like a wife being loyal only <br />to her Husband. Thirumazhisai Azhwar's life history signifies tis. He <br />was a staunch Vaishnavite everyone knows. One when he was stiching <br />his clothes, Siva and Parvathi were coming rounds around the earth <br />and Parvathi was attracted by the "tEjas" of this Azhwar and told <br />Siva that we should give him some boon. Siva, knowing about this <br />Azhwar, was hesitant but gave in to the pressure of Parvathi <br />(mmmmm.... anga kooda appidithAn pola) and both came down and asked <br />the Azhwar to ask for a boon. The Azhwar said with complete respect <br />that he does not want anything from them. But when insisted, he being <br />a truly surrendered soul awaiting only mOksha, asked for it. Siva <br />says that only Vishnu can give that. Azhwar says then he does not <br />want anything. But again on insisting, he asked a very trivial boon <br />that the thread should enter the needle at the back. Though at the <br />outset it will look like a dry sarcasm without any respect, it is <br />just reflective of the position that he does not want anything. The <br />Azhwar never disrespected Siva. This is the same bhAvam that all <br />Iyengars follow. </p>
<p>However, if any Iyengar, talks ill of any other God, not only Siva, <br />he ceases to be a true Vaishnavite as again Nammazhwar glorifies in <br />his Thiruviruttham this time as....</p>
<p>vaNangum thuRaigaL pala pala Aakki, madhi vigaRppAl<br />piNangum samayam pala pala Aakki, avai avaidhOru<br />aNangum pala pala Aakki, nin moorthi parappi vaithAi<br />iNangu ninnOrai illAi, nin <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  vEtkai ezhuvippaNE</p>
<p>Wonderful words. For Nammazhwar everything is Vishnu or Kannan as he <br />says "....uNNum sOru, thinnum vetRilai, parugum nIr, ellAm kaNNan..." <br />He say in the above pAsuram that Vishnu created so many religions <br />and so many forms of worship so that all the jeevAthmAs can attain <br />salvation by one means or other and He is present in all those <br />religions and forms. So where is the question of disrespecting Siva <br />or for that sake any god. I would consider that every God of every <br />religion is Vishnu as per the above words of the Kulapathi Nammazhwar.</p>
<p>And lastly I dont want to start a debate on Vaishnavism Vs Saivism <br />and spoil the wonderful ambience of this group, which respects all.</p>
<p>Sorry for the digression and thank you for the opportunity to present <br />a more clear picture about the Vaishnavites sticking only to Vishnu, <br />which is definitely not fanaticism, but a bhAvam as per their <br />philosophy.</p>

<p>    The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial debate going on<br />    between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The thenkalais claim <br />that<br />    vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only after Ramanuja, <br />but<br />    only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in the <br />Guruparampara.<br />    The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated from Pillai<br />    Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.</p>
<p>    This debate will never end as both are not ready to accept the<br />    other's views. Let us leave it at that. However, if one enters <br />into a<br />    philosophical debate, I had recently written a small writeup<br />    regarding this kalai differences in one of the personal mails on <br />that<br />    debate. If members are willing, I can share it here. Ofcourse, it <br />is<br />    subject to a debate.</p>
<p>    Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived for 120 years. <br />He<br />    attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These are the timelines<br />    which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>    Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no link to the<br />    Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have happened later, though<br />    within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in saying that<br />    Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam from the sea and <br />got<br />    it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty sure, how he was<br />    reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read somewhere (may be in<br />    this group itself) that He was reinstated during the times of <br />Nayak<br />    kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>    Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is neither acting as<br />    Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest of the Temple of<br />    Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no mention in the<br />    history.</p>

<p>      Hi<br />      so many venkatesh's in the group now.</p>
<p>      i have seen the tatooing( or branding) instruments used on <br />ramanuja<br />      himself(???) in mathuranthakam temple. they were discovered in a<br />      secret chamber in the last decade</p>
<p>      .     So if he still has taken such a<br />      scene<br />        like King asking Ramanuja instead of Koorathazhwan to recite <br />the<br />        verses,</p>
<p>          This person im talking about also has the tatoo (or is it<br />    burned<br />        into the<br />          skin? Can somebody confirm this?) on his bicep.</p>
<p>      rahul , kamal also had a thenkalai naamam( straight lined like a<br />      trident rather than the U of vadakalai)</p>
<p>      but one doubt??<br />      didnt vadakalai originate after ramanuja??? then how does he do<br />    this<br />      say some 50 years prior?</p>
<p>      can sps clarify the timelines of</p>
<p>      a. ramanuja<br />      b. the chitrakootam incident of govindarajar and the sea <br />dropping.</p>
<p>      isnt there a prevalent story that ramanuja recovered it and <br />placed<br />      it in kizh tirupathi?????</p>
<p>      venketesh</p>
<p>      They are not<br />        allowed to have<br />          a moustache/beard too. But Kamal has both in that particular<br />      scene.<br />          I think its pretty hard to stick with the legend in the <br />movie.<br />        Maybe Kamal<br />          just took the cusp and formed a creative story based on <br />that.<br />    The<br />        movie<br />          should clear this up.</p>

<p>            Well, that was a really confusing statement from MK.<br />    Actually<br />        according<br />            to the Srivaishnavite Guruparampara which talks about the<br />      stories<br />        of<br />            all the Acharyas of Srivaishnavism starting from Nathamuni<br />    until<br />            Manavalamamuni, it is not Ramanuja who was asked by the <br />Chola<br />        King to<br />            recite Siva's name as supreme.</p>
<p>            The story goes thus: (As taken from the <br />book "Guruparampara<br />        Prabhavam")</p>
<p>            ..... Once when Ramanuja was away from his mutt, at Kaveri<br />    for<br />      his<br />            bath, the soldiers of the Chola King came to his mutt and<br />        informed that<br />            the King has ordained Ramanuja to court. Knowing well <br />about<br />    the<br />            Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, <br />the<br />        foremost<br />            disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome <br />of<br />    the<br />            meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya<br />    and<br />        hence he<br />            silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along <br />with<br />        Periya<br />            Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the<br />    Chola<br />        King in<br />            the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other <br />disciples<br />    of<br />            Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and <br />asked<br />      them<br />        to<br />            prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though<br />      Ramanuja<br />        did<br />            not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that<br />      Koorathazhwan<br />        has<br />            already left in disguise, and also giving in to the <br />pressure<br />    by<br />        his<br />            other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of<br />    his<br />        Acharya<br />            (Periya Nambi) and his Sishya (Koorathazhwan), left for<br />    Melkote<br />      in<br />            present day Karnataka.</p>
<p>            Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However,<br />    there<br />        was a<br />            minister by name "Naalooran" in King's court, who was once<br />        supposed to<br />            have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately <br />identified<br />      him<br />            (traditional accounts vary from calling this act as <br />treachery<br />      to<br />        utmost<br />            concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth <br />yet to<br />    be<br />            deciphered) as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained<br />        Koorathazhwan to<br />            write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The<br />        wording that<br />            Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam<br />      nAsthi".<br />            Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course<br />      Koorathazhwan<br />        did<br />            write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi <br />thatha<br />        param".<br />            Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than 'sivam". In older<br />    days<br />        the<br />            words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. <br />drONam<br />      was<br />        larger<br />            in measurement than sivam.</p>
<p>            On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and <br />asked<br />      the<br />        eyes<br />            of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya <br />Nambi.<br />        However<br />            Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my<br />    eyes.<br />      I<br />        will<br />            do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" <br />and<br />        plucks it<br />            himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the <br />pain.</p>
<p>            This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete <br />screw-<br />    up<br />      in<br />        the<br />            screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true.<br />      However<br />        we<br />            cannot conclude until the movie is out and we see it for<br />        ourselves.</p>

<p>  Dear SPs<br />  the perumal in chitra kootam( the vaishnavaite sector of thillai) <br />was<br />  definitely removed</p>
<p>  a replacement was made during 16th or 17th centuries by a <br />vaishnavite<br />  king of senji<br />  the second incident is well recorded</p>
<p>  trivia<br />  in protest against the re- installation of the vaishnava idol<br />  some saivaite dikshitars committed suicide by falling off the<br />  towers'<br />===============================</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Had you been to Thillai vilagam near Vedaranyam / Tiruvarur?</p>
<p>An ancient Ramar Bronze was found there about 80 yrs back and<br />positioned in this temple ..</p>
<p>There was a point raised for consideration based on this soemtime <br />back:</p>
<p>CHITRAKUDAM is related to Ramayana - where Ramar had a role to play?<br />What Govindaraja was doing in Chitrakudam?</p>
<p>Since Ramar was found in Thillaivilagam, there is possibility that<br />Chitrakudam should have been Thillaivilagam - NOT IN CHIDAMBARAM - <br />but<br />bearing the same name near Tiruvarur / Vedaranyam!</p>
<p>There are ayes and nos to this line of thinking !</p>
<p>But no doubt Thillaivilagam Ramar is a Great Bronze - which has small<br />bells in the Dhanusu - reminding us of the one which created <br />continuous<br />ringning of bells for about one Muhurtham - when Rama destroyed<br />Ravana's Moolabala Senai!</p>
<p>The Lotus pond is reportedly nurturing SAHASRA IDHAZH LOTUS (1000<br />idhazh konda Thamari) even today !</p>
