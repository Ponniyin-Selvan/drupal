<blockquote><p>  Hi Jagathesh,</p>
<p>  I think you didnt read my mail properly. Please do<br />  it once again. I <br />  said I have not read the vedas nor do I know<br />  Sanskrit. So I cant <br />  directly tell you the actual meaning of the lines<br />  you have put.</p>
<p>  For anything, there can be two meanings, the<br />  original meaning and a <br />  derived meaning. In my previous example, 'mama' as a<br />  good <br />  relationship is the original meaning. The context we<br />  use it today is <br />  the derived meaning. This does not mean that the<br />  original meaning <br />  itself was bad.<br />  The verses you have found or the ones which the<br />  great Charu has <br />  translated are derived meanings. Each one can derive<br />  their own <br />  meaning from any word.As I said, the perverts see<br />  the wrong meaning <br />  and the good souls see the correct meaning.</p>
<p>  Vedas are the epitome of gnana, the ultimate truth<br />  which each and <br />  every one should strive to achive. Great rishis and<br />  munis have spent <br />  their lifetime without understanding the true<br />  meaning of this <br />  knowledge, the Brahmam. If thats the case of such<br />  great people, who <br />  is this Charu or the pagutharivalars to tell the<br />  meaning of Vedas? <br />  Its like saying, I have drunk the full ocean just by<br />  drinking a drop <br />  from the ocean. Its ignorance.</p>
<p>  Often the 'soma panam' is referred and criticised<br />  that liqour is <br />  offered to the devas. It has been registered in our<br />  minds that Soma <br />  panam is liquor. In actual, Soma is a mooligai which<br />  gets its full <br />  potency during Full moon night and is capable of<br />  giving long life, <br />  health and prosperity. hence its named after the<br />  moon as Soma. <br />  Naravu is actually liquor. But our great<br />  pagutharivalars criticise <br />  vedas saying liquor is offered to gods and we<br />  intellectuals belive <br />  them without questioning ourselves. This is just a<br />  tip of the <br />  iceberg and likewise all the statement of vedas have<br />  been twisted or <br />  meaning has been DERIVED. oru panai sotrukku oru<br />  soru padam. </p>
<p>  Its said that brahmins never allowed others to read<br />  vedas. I accept <br />  that when one clan prospers some sort of attrocities<br />  do prevail in <br />  the society. But it should not be attributed to the<br />  vedas. <br />  Tirumoolar who was destined to write about the vedic<br />  principles in <br />  tamil is a idayan. Many rishis like<br />  Agathiyar,valmiki, are not <br />  brahmins. Even the sage vyasa who consolidated vedas<br />  is not a <br />  brahmin. sage Sugar, who is considered to be the<br />  epitome of gnana is <br />  a paraya.</p>
<p>  In kamba ramayanam, kambar says that, Rama, with the<br />  mouth in which <br />  he utters the vedas enquire about the welfare of the<br />  country people. <br />  When Lakshmana gets angry at many places, Rama<br />  consoles him saying <br />  that its not good for a person who chants the vedas<br />  to get angry. <br />  rama and lakshmana are kshatriyas and not brahmins.<br />  Even if we <br />  consider Ramayanam is just a story and not true,<br />  kambar would have <br />  written only about the practice he heard or the<br />  practice which was <br />  followed in his days. So its evident that 800 years<br />  back non-<br />  brahmins too chanted vedas.</p>
<p>  If vedas are really bad as these peeople picturise,<br />  it would not <br />  have survived for thousands and thousands of years.<br />  In just 60 years <br />  if these pagutharivalars have become epitome of<br />  knowledge by which <br />  they are capable of commenting on vedas, then our<br />  ancestors should <br />  have been fools for ages.</p>
<p>  We talk a lot about RRC and RJC who themselves have<br />  patronized vedas <br />  and brahmins. Are they fools to do so? If we boast<br />  about our <br />  ancestors who are so great in building wonders like<br />  Big temple, are <br />  they fools to close thier eyes on the attrocities of<br />  vedas? </p>
<p>  When Indian constitution was written, it was felt<br />  that the sc/st <br />  should grow up in educational and economic status<br />  and hence the <br />  reservation system was brought in. Ambedkar clearly<br />  said after 50 <br />  years it should be abolished. Minorities were given<br />  special <br />  previlages only to grow up in social strature and<br />  feel secured in <br />  this land. But today we see that the reservation<br />  quota is increasing <br />  day by day, the minorities rule the majority and we<br />  cant do <br />  anything. Is it the fault of Constitution or the<br />  people? The <br />  constituion was right in its own sense, but we<br />  people misused it. <br />  Similarly, vedas were right in their own sense, but<br />  the people <br />  misused it. Critisicing vedas is like criticising<br />  the constitution <br />  for its reservation policy and minority policy.</p>
<p>  Recently I came across an article in Thinnai about<br />  Barathiyar. The <br />  link is ot working now and hence I could not provide<br />  the same here. <br />  The author has criticised Barathiyar saying that he<br />  is a pro-brahmin <br />  and advocated casteism. Any sane person will laugh<br />  at this even <br />  without reading all the works of Barathiyar. The<br />  proof the author <br />  shows are simply great. he picks up one line from a<br />  peom which gives <br />  a caste based meaning and says that Barathiyar is<br />  not great because <br />  he has written like this. But if you read the entire<br />  stanza of that <br />  poem the same line gives totally a different<br />  picture. The same <br />  strategy is being followed by the pagutharivalars to<br />  derive the <br />  meaning of vedas.</p>
<p>  Valluvar said 'Poimayum vaimayidatha puraitheerntha<br />  nanmai payakkum <br />  enin'. I can quote the first half 'poimayum<br />  vaimayidatha' and derive <br />  a meaning that valluvar equated poi and vaimai ie.<br />  truth and lie are <br />  one and the same and can tell that valluvar is a<br />  fraud who preaches <br />  that truth and lie are no different. Does it make<br />  sense? Unless the <br />  full kural is spelt out, the meaning is incomplete.<br />  Since we know <br />  tamil, we can negate that statement, but since we<br />  dont know sanskrit <br />  we are at a loss and blindly belive what the great<br />  people like <br />  periyar and charu say. </p>
<p>  Another best example is Karunanidhis remark on<br />  Bagavatgita around a <br />  year back. the whole world praises Bagavadgita, the<br />  greatest book on <br />  yoga. Whether the history behind is true or not, the<br />  content of the <br />  gita are of great value. It talks about gnana yoga,<br />  bhakthi yoga, <br />  raja yoga and karma yoga and finally Krishna says of<br />  all the yoga <br />  Karma yoga is the best and Arjuna, being a kshtriya<br />  you should do <br />  your karma of fighting and killing your enemies. If<br />  you remember <br />  Karunanidhis comment, he said that bhagavadgita<br />  preches violence and <br />  it talks about killing people. No Hindu protested or<br />  it was never <br />  made a big issue. So if a person can derive a<br />  meaning out of a world <br />  renouned book without being questioned, why cant the<br />  people of the <br />  same clan derive whatever meaning they want out of<br />  vedas?</p>

<p>I have heard that Quran talks about killing people who dont worship <br />alla. Will this karunanidhi or his clan ever dare to comment on <br />this? Recent times the books of Dan Brown has created world wide <br />stir because of the truths he has written about the cursade and the <br />churches practices which are nowhere near to dharma, will these <br />people ever dare to talk about these? THEY WILL NEVER EVER TALK <br />because they very well know Hindus are the only ilachavais who will <br />never question about anything.</p>
<p>Vedas talk about the brahmam or the ultimat truth which is nowhere <br />near our reach. It will take us several janmas to understand the <br />meaning of vedas and the ultimate truth. </p>
<p>Tirumoolar says that Siva will destroy this whole universe at the <br />end of pralayam. You know how he will destroy it? Moolar <br />says, 'iruttai iruttaki azhippan' meaning he will make darkness even <br />more darker before destroying, ie. the ignorant will become more <br />ignorant, agnanam will prevail the most during the end of days. We <br />can evidently see that agnanam prevailing now and thats why these <br />anti-vedic movement has started. :)</p>
<p>If you feel that I am biased, after reading all this, so be it. :)</p>

        <p>Dear SPS,<br />Exactly thats my point too. 'Vedas' was created based on the creation time, creation environment (including creators' society). So, infact, Vedas were written keeping in mind a particular society. <br />And, if so, and if the critisisms are true, then Vedas cann't be accepted by all in this current pluralistic society. </p>

        <p>Hi,<br />Could you please give the correct meaning then for those mentioned in the 'Critisism' list?</p>

<p>During my childhood days, I used to call all our neighbours and <br />family friends as 'mama-mami' irrespective of whether they are <br />brahmins or not. But our society has corrupted these two words that <br />today we hesitate to utter these words. Mama is linked to a filthy <br />profession and mami an notorious word used in films to depict <br />bhrahmin ladies in bad light. But the original words meant different.</p>
<p>Today when someone utters mama or mami a good person takes it in the <br />right sense of a good relationship. a pervert will surely take it <br />otherwise and laugh.</p>
<p>same words different meaning to different people. Being good or <br />pervert is in our hands. If one word can be twisted like this, think <br />about a language like tamil or sanskrit which has thousand meanings <br />to each words. The anti-vedic and anti-brahminic people will <br />definitely like to take the wrong meaning and the good will take the <br />good. </p>
<p>Its in our hands to be perverts or not.</p>

        <p>Hi,<br />The hot debate over here actually made me read deep into the issue. I have came across similar views (as the source of this discussion) in quite a lot of places. </p>
<p>Please go through this 'wikipedia' about 'Vedas' .(The contents under 'Critisism of Vedas' and source of the discussion have similar views). Please follow this link: <br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas</a></p>

<p>NO SUCH RESERVATION IN LEARNING VEDAS, ITS HAS RESTRICTION THATS ALSO NOT BY BIRTH , ITS ALL ABOUT THE MATTER OF INTEREST AND FAITH</p>
<p>2. Why is Sanskrit still used in Temples? Doesn't Tamil contains words to praise God?</p>
<p>THERE R ENOUGH EVIDENCE ON <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  PERIOD THAT DEVARAM WAS PLAYED MAIN ROLE( THERE R GRANTS GIVEN FOR THAT JOB), HOWEVER GETTING IN TO DEEP , HOW,WHEN,WHOM FOR VEDAS IMPORTANCE IN TEMPLE REQUIRES MORE STUDY AND ITS SENSITIVE ALSO.</p>
<p>3. Why does Indian Govt. took such a long time to announce Tamil as a 'Classical Language'?</p>
<p>ITS A POLITICAL GAME, WE HAVE NOTHING TO DISCUSS</p>
<p>4. Why is certain people (sanskrit) not ready to accept Tamil as root language for all south indian languages (Kannada,Malayalam,Telugu)?</p>
<p>PEOPLES IN TAMILNADU ARE ACEEPTING BUT ITS A MATTER OF OTHER STATE PEOPLES TO ACCEPT , NATURALLY THEY FEEL THEIR LANGUAGE IS BEST </p>
<p>I think this GROUP SHOULD GIVE MORE PREFERENCE TO TAMIL and discuss its heritage. I feel We should not allow to use this forum for the purpose that undermine Tamil in any way directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>One sad thing is even Tamils (not all) are giving due respect to Tamil not to mention about other societies.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hello,</p>
<p>  It is unfortunate that people comment on Vedas<br />  without<br />  proper knowledge or information. Now lets us look<br />  what<br />  are Vedas are about. Sorry its going to be lengthy.</p>
<p>  Vedas are written in highly allegorical language.<br />  That is in a very symbolic language. The word "agni"<br />  means the force in our hearts which propels us to do<br />  good things. Vedic seers were great poets who used<br />  the<br />  outside burning fire (agni) as a symbolic<br />  representation of this burning fire in our hearts do<br />  to good. </p>
<p>  Agni &#150; the divine will:<br />  "Agni is the will of seers; supreme in spiritual<br />  audition; the very truth."<br />  - Rig Veda 1.1.5</p>
<p>  Like this, all the devathas mentioned are inner<br />  forces<br />  within us which We have to cultivate to attain<br />  enlightenment. Veda's subject is Spirituality and<br />  not<br />  rituals as it is popularly believed. In Samhita<br />  portions of Rig there is not a single ritual or a<br />  story given. All these kind of inner forces in us<br />  have<br />  been described and ways are given on how to develop<br />  them to attain enlightenment. </p>
<p>  Lets understand what is Vedas first. Vedas are made<br />  up<br />  of two parts. One is Samhita. Other is brahmana.<br />  Brahmana is again divided into 3 parts, namely<br />  brahmana, aranyaka and upanishads.</p>
<p>  Following lines are from a soon to be published book<br />  on Vedas by Shri R.Rangan:<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />  "Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and S?maVeda are most<br />  original, most authentic and most ancient in the<br />  whole<br />  Vedic literature. It is most authentic because the<br />  Mantras of the Samhit?s are considered to be derived<br />  from the Supreme space of consciousness. Those which<br />  are supposed to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness are considered as more authentic than<br />  those of human authorship."</p>
<p>  According to the RgVeda samhit? it&#146;s Mantras are<br />  considered to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness. In the RgVeda samhit?, there is<br />  mention of YajurVeda samhit? and S?maVeda samhit?   also.</p>
<p>  Thus they are also considered to be most authentic<br />  and evidential. Therefore the samhit?s of RgVeda,<br />  YajurVeda and S?maVeda are considered as the<br />  impersonal wisdom (apaurusheya).</p>
<p>  Samhit?s are the collection of Mantras. These<br />  Mantras<br />  neither narrate stories nor prescribe rituals. Their<br />  subject matter is the description of concepts. The<br />  Samhit? speaks of the subtle concepts of cognition<br />  which are very much useful in the mundane and<br />  spiritual life.</p>
<p>  Br?mha?as are the texts composed in later ages,<br />  compared to Samhit?s, to explain the application of<br />  the samhit?s in rituals and day to day culture. To<br />  simplify the samhit?s, composers of Br?mha?as<br />  adopted several techniques. The composers of<br />  Br?mha?as<br />  of the Vedic literature tried to simplify the<br />  Samhit?s, by prescribing various rites, narrating<br />  myths and describing values.</p>
<p>  The scriptural evidence of impersonality of Br?mha?a<br />  texts is neither found in samhit? nor in Br?mha?a<br />  texts and yet it is a matter of belief in the<br />  tradition. Thus Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and<br />  S?maVeda are the most authentic among all Hindu<br />  scriptures as they are considered to be the<br />  impersonal<br />  wisdom. Therefore these Samhit?s are the main Vedas<br />  for which Br?mha?as become ancillaries.</p>
<p>  Subject matter of the Vedas:<br />  Subject matter of the Vedas is the description of<br />  Devas. Almost all chapters of the Vedas contain<br />  different types of hymns about Devas. It is very<br />  important to know Devas from Vedic point of view.<br />  Devas are not mere persons in the Vedas. Devas are<br />  natural elements around us without which we cannot<br />  live. This is the preliminary understanding about<br />  Devas. Eg: Vayu is the blowing wind; Agni is the<br />  fire;   Varuna is the power in water; Sarasvati, Ganga and<br />  Sindhu are rivers; Indra is thunder and rain; surya<br />  is<br />  sun and Soma is moon. In this way earth, space,<br />  stars,<br />  planets and ocean- everything around us are<br />  considered<br />  as Devas without which we cannot live and therefore<br />  we<br />  are obliged to respect all of them.</p>
<p>  Further in the Vedas these Devas are not only<br />  perceived as natural elements but also as natural<br />  forces that are dwelling in us without which we<br />  cannot<br />  live. Eg: Vayu is the vital energy; Agni is the heat<br />  and sound energy; Varuna represents the energy in<br />  all<br />  fluids etc</p>
<p>  In the deeper sense these Devas are perceived and<br />  understood as the various concepts of cognition or<br />  cognitive powers. This is because each and every<br />  natural element in the external world has become the<br />  symbolic representation or archetypal expression of<br />  the higher and the conceptual and the cognitive<br />  world.<br />  This concrete world is nothing but the manifestation<br />  of the conceptual and cognitive world.</p>
<p>  Eg: Vayu which is blowing wind in the concrete world<br />  represents the core Prana of Psyche and beyond in<br />  cognitive world. Agni which is fire in the gross<br />  world represents the burning will of the Divine that<br />  dwells in the cognitive realm to guide the<br />  aspirants.<br />  Varuna which is the water in gross world, represents<br />  the basic law of universe or the cosmic order in the<br />  cognitive realm. Sarasvati and sindhu which are the<br />  rivers in the gross world represent the flow of<br />  inspiration in the cognitive realm.</p>
<p>  Indra which is the rain and lightning and thunder in<br />  the gross world, represents cognitive strength and<br />  power which destroys all evil forces of the psyche.<br />  Surya &#150; the Sun in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  Self-light or Self- wisdom itself in the inner<br />  world.<br />  Soma &#150; the moon in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  aesthetic flow of Bliss and peace. In this way all<br />  natural elements and forces remain the archetypal<br />  expressions and symbolic manifestations of the<br />  cognitive forces.</p>
<p>  Objective of the Vedas:<br />  Understanding the Self as the fundamental Truth of<br />  the whole existence and to live the life with that<br />  Self as the fundamental principle, is the objective<br />  of<br />  the Vedas. The very nature of this Self is absolute<br />  Silence, peace, bliss and harmony. The Self is pure<br />  conscious Being which is eternal.</p>
<p>  Form the ocean like silent conscious being, wave<br />  like<br />  cognitive powers, tides like natural forces and<br />  bubbles like gross manifestations of natural<br />  elements<br />  occur. As tides, waves and bubbles are not different<br />  from ocean, the Nature &#150; both internal and external<br />  is<br />  not different from the conscious Being.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>  Again Keerthivasan writing:</p>
<p>  Vedas are the only spiritual book i have seen that<br />  doesn't speak a single word against women. In<br />  Atharva<br />  Veda it says that the King should have army<br />  regiments<br />  made of women. It even makes it very clear that<br />  widow<br />  remarriage can be done. It even talks about a<br />  different kind of democratic practice. </p>
<p>  To demystify Vedas, we (a small group) are<br />  conducting<br />  lectures, camps etc in many places. On June 2nd, 3rd<br />  and 4th we are having a residential camp on Vedas &amp;   Yoga in Banglore. All are welcome. I am attaching a<br />  word document giving all the details of the camp.</p>
<p>  With regards,<br />  Keerthivasan.R</p>

        <p>Dear Mr.SPS,<br />Thanks for your elaborate mail.</p>
<p>I never said that we should not discuss other topics. But my concern was topics which undermine Tamil language directly or indirectly should not be encouraged.</p>
<p>Also I know from the archives that this group had very good discussions in the past. That doesn't stop us from discussing similar topics.<br />Moreover this group is dedicated for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  topic discussion. Members may be frustrated by the topics which are irrelevent. Not all the members will come out and express themselves. Most members are silent listeners. So, they should not be neglected. That may make them move away from the group. </p>
<p>Also I think non-indian and indian origin friends came to this forum to discuss <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  related topics. Because lot of other groups are there to discuss general topics.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Jaga</p>

<p>Please go through Archieves and see how many mails have flown on <br />Tamil Culture - Literature etc. As rightly observed by Mr CCS Rajan <br />discussing other language does not mean to undermine Tamil.</p>
<p>Vedas already translated, read and discussed widely in English and <br />other foreign languages. Group Indology - more participants from <br />members of Non-Indian origin - discusses Indian Literature and <br />Culture very extensively.</p>
<p>We are in India, which is multi-lingual state. </p>
<p>We have been already discussing that the Brahmi used by Emperor <br />might have geen migrated from the Brahmi - Tamil - which was <br />evidently in use during 3rd BC - 3rd AD.</p>
<p>Representation of Tamils in the Central Cabinet is becoming possible <br />only now and hence these matters are also taken up.</p>
<p>Pls go through earlier mails. History is not properly taught to us <br />in Schools.</p>
<p>We are all aware that Tamil contains Holistic words :</p>
<p>Thirugnana Sambandar hymned and a girl Poombavai came out of the <br />mudpot wherein her bones were kept - near Mylapore Kabaleeswarar <br />temple!</p>
<p>Recent mail talks of releasing a Stamp for Thiruvalluvar. <br />We have to bring out the works of Thirumnoolar also. </p>
<p>We are united and discussing here because of Ponniyinselvan, who is <br />described as Lord Vishnu having the marks of Sanghu and Chakram - in <br />the Sanskrit portion of Thiruvalangadu Copper plates!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hello,</p>
<p>  It is unfortunate that people comment on Vedas<br />  without<br />  proper knowledge or information. Now lets us look<br />  what<br />  are Vedas are about. Sorry its going to be lengthy.</p>
<p>  Vedas are written in highly allegorical language.<br />  That is in a very symbolic language. The word "agni"<br />  means the force in our hearts which propels us to do<br />  good things. Vedic seers were great poets who used<br />  the<br />  outside burning fire (agni) as a symbolic<br />  representation of this burning fire in our hearts do<br />  to good. </p>
<p>  Agni &#150; the divine will:<br />  "Agni is the will of seers; supreme in spiritual<br />  audition; the very truth."<br />  - Rig Veda 1.1.5</p>
<p>  Like this, all the devathas mentioned are inner<br />  forces<br />  within us which We have to cultivate to attain<br />  enlightenment. Veda's subject is Spirituality and<br />  not<br />  rituals as it is popularly believed. In Samhita<br />  portions of Rig there is not a single ritual or a<br />  story given. All these kind of inner forces in us<br />  have<br />  been described and ways are given on how to develop<br />  them to attain enlightenment. </p>
<p>  Lets understand what is Vedas first. Vedas are made<br />  up<br />  of two parts. One is Samhita. Other is brahmana.<br />  Brahmana is again divided into 3 parts, namely<br />  brahmana, aranyaka and upanishads.</p>
<p>  Following lines are from a soon to be published book<br />  on Vedas by Shri R.Rangan:<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />  "Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and S?maVeda are most<br />  original, most authentic and most ancient in the<br />  whole<br />  Vedic literature. It is most authentic because the<br />  Mantras of the Samhit?s are considered to be derived<br />  from the Supreme space of consciousness. Those which<br />  are supposed to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness are considered as more authentic than<br />  those of human authorship."</p>
<p>  According to the RgVeda samhit? it&#146;s Mantras are<br />  considered to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness. In the RgVeda samhit?, there is<br />  mention of YajurVeda samhit? and S?maVeda samhit?   also.</p>
<p>  Thus they are also considered to be most authentic<br />  and evidential. Therefore the samhit?s of RgVeda,<br />  YajurVeda and S?maVeda are considered as the<br />  impersonal wisdom (apaurusheya).</p>
<p>  Samhit?s are the collection of Mantras. These<br />  Mantras<br />  neither narrate stories nor prescribe rituals. Their<br />  subject matter is the description of concepts. The<br />  Samhit? speaks of the subtle concepts of cognition<br />  which are very much useful in the mundane and<br />  spiritual life.</p>
<p>  Br?mha?as are the texts composed in later ages,<br />  compared to Samhit?s, to explain the application of<br />  the samhit?s in rituals and day to day culture. To<br />  simplify the samhit?s, composers of Br?mha?as<br />  adopted several techniques. The composers of<br />  Br?mha?as<br />  of the Vedic literature tried to simplify the<br />  Samhit?s, by prescribing various rites, narrating<br />  myths and describing values.</p>
<p>  The scriptural evidence of impersonality of Br?mha?a<br />  texts is neither found in samhit? nor in Br?mha?a<br />  texts and yet it is a matter of belief in the<br />  tradition. Thus Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and<br />  S?maVeda are the most authentic among all Hindu<br />  scriptures as they are considered to be the<br />  impersonal<br />  wisdom. Therefore these Samhit?s are the main Vedas<br />  for which Br?mha?as become ancillaries.</p>
<p>  Subject matter of the Vedas:<br />  Subject matter of the Vedas is the description of<br />  Devas. Almost all chapters of the Vedas contain<br />  different types of hymns about Devas. It is very<br />  important to know Devas from Vedic point of view.<br />  Devas are not mere persons in the Vedas. Devas are<br />  natural elements around us without which we cannot<br />  live. This is the preliminary understanding about<br />  Devas. Eg: Vayu is the blowing wind; Agni is the<br />  fire;   Varuna is the power in water; Sarasvati, Ganga and<br />  Sindhu are rivers; Indra is thunder and rain; surya<br />  is<br />  sun and Soma is moon. In this way earth, space,<br />  stars,<br />  planets and ocean- everything around us are<br />  considered<br />  as Devas without which we cannot live and therefore<br />  we<br />  are obliged to respect all of them.</p>
<p>  Further in the Vedas these Devas are not only<br />  perceived as natural elements but also as natural<br />  forces that are dwelling in us without which we<br />  cannot<br />  live. Eg: Vayu is the vital energy; Agni is the heat<br />  and sound energy; Varuna represents the energy in<br />  all<br />  fluids etc</p>
<p>  In the deeper sense these Devas are perceived and<br />  understood as the various concepts of cognition or<br />  cognitive powers. This is because each and every<br />  natural element in the external world has become the<br />  symbolic representation or archetypal expression of<br />  the higher and the conceptual and the cognitive<br />  world.<br />  This concrete world is nothing but the manifestation<br />  of the conceptual and cognitive world.</p>
<p>  Eg: Vayu which is blowing wind in the concrete world<br />  represents the core Prana of Psyche and beyond in<br />  cognitive world. Agni which is fire in the gross<br />  world represents the burning will of the Divine that<br />  dwells in the cognitive realm to guide the<br />  aspirants.<br />  Varuna which is the water in gross world, represents<br />  the basic law of universe or the cosmic order in the<br />  cognitive realm. Sarasvati and sindhu which are the<br />  rivers in the gross world represent the flow of<br />  inspiration in the cognitive realm.</p>
<p>  Indra which is the rain and lightning and thunder in<br />  the gross world, represents cognitive strength and<br />  power which destroys all evil forces of the psyche.<br />  Surya &#150; the Sun in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  Self-light or Self- wisdom itself in the inner<br />  world.<br />  Soma &#150; the moon in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  aesthetic flow of Bliss and peace. In this way all<br />  natural elements and forces remain the archetypal<br />  expressions and symbolic manifestations of the<br />  cognitive forces.</p>
<p>  Objective of the Vedas:<br />  Understanding the Self as the fundamental Truth of<br />  the whole existence and to live the life with that<br />  Self as the fundamental principle, is the objective<br />  of<br />  the Vedas. The very nature of this Self is absolute<br />  Silence, peace, bliss and harmony. The Self is pure<br />  conscious Being which is eternal.</p>
<p>  Form the ocean like silent conscious being, wave<br />  like<br />  cognitive powers, tides like natural forces and<br />  bubbles like gross manifestations of natural<br />  elements<br />  occur. As tides, waves and bubbles are not different<br />  from ocean, the Nature &#150; both internal and external<br />  is<br />  not different from the conscious Being.</p>

<p>  Again Keerthivasan writing:</p>
<p>  Vedas are the only spiritual book i have seen that<br />  doesn't speak a single word against women. In<br />  Atharva<br />  Veda it says that the King should have army<br />  regiments<br />  made of women. It even makes it very clear that<br />  widow<br />  remarriage can be done. It even talks about a<br />  different kind of democratic practice. </p>
<p>  To demystify Vedas, we (a small group) are<br />  conducting<br />  lectures, camps etc in many places. On June 2nd, 3rd<br />  and 4th we are having a residential camp on Vedas &amp;   Yoga in Banglore. All are welcome. I am attaching a<br />  word document giving all the details of the camp.</p>

<p>Hi Jaga <br />I think nobody is trying to preach anything here. We basically started discussing Ponniyin Selvan and Kalki.Thanks due to the inputs of many experts in history, we as a group including a novice like myself started discussing many things beyond <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ,but related to the culture and heritage of our COUNTRY. Vedas are part of our culture. In my opinion there is nothing wrong to highlight their values, especially when they are subjected to unjustified criticism. By doing this we are not comparing or demeaning other literary works of Tamil or any other Language.<br />My humble opinion.<br />Thanks<br />Sundar</acronym></p>

<p>--- Keerthivasan Keerthivasan<br /><keerthivasanbharat@yahoo.com  wrote:</p></keerthivasanbharat@yahoo.com></p>
<blockquote><p>  Hello,</p>
<p>  It is unfortunate that people comment on Vedas<br />  without<br />  proper knowledge or information. Now lets us look<br />  what<br />  are Vedas are about. Sorry its going to be lengthy.</p>
<p>  Vedas are written in highly allegorical language.<br />  That is in a very symbolic language. The word "agni"<br />  means the force in our hearts which propels us to do<br />  good things. Vedic seers were great poets who used<br />  the<br />  outside burning fire (agni) as a symbolic<br />  representation of this burning fire in our hearts do<br />  to good. </p>
<p>  Agni &#150; the divine will:<br />  "Agni is the will of seers; supreme in spiritual<br />  audition; the very truth."<br />  - Rig Veda 1.1.5</p>
<p>  Like this, all the devathas mentioned are inner<br />  forces<br />  within us which We have to cultivate to attain<br />  enlightenment. Veda's subject is Spirituality and<br />  not<br />  rituals as it is popularly believed. In Samhita<br />  portions of Rig there is not a single ritual or a<br />  story given. All these kind of inner forces in us<br />  have<br />  been described and ways are given on how to develop<br />  them to attain enlightenment. </p>
<p>  Lets understand what is Vedas first. Vedas are made<br />  up<br />  of two parts. One is Samhita. Other is brahmana.<br />  Brahmana is again divided into 3 parts, namely<br />  brahmana, aranyaka and upanishads.</p>
<p>  Following lines are from a soon to be published book<br />  on Vedas by Shri R.Rangan:<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />  "Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and S?maVeda are most<br />  original, most authentic and most ancient in the<br />  whole<br />  Vedic literature. It is most authentic because the<br />  Mantras of the Samhit?s are considered to be derived<br />  from the Supreme space of consciousness. Those which<br />  are supposed to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness are considered as more authentic than<br />  those of human authorship."</p>
<p>  According to the RgVeda samhit? it&#146;s Mantras are<br />  considered to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness. In the RgVeda samhit?, there is<br />  mention of YajurVeda samhit? and S?maVeda samhit?   also.</p>
<p>  Thus they are also considered to be most authentic<br />  and evidential. Therefore the samhit?s of RgVeda,<br />  YajurVeda and S?maVeda are considered as the<br />  impersonal wisdom (apaurusheya).</p>
<p>  Samhit?s are the collection of Mantras. These<br />  Mantras<br />  neither narrate stories nor prescribe rituals. Their<br />  subject matter is the description of concepts. The<br />  Samhit? speaks of the subtle concepts of cognition<br />  which are very much useful in the mundane and<br />  spiritual life.</p>
<p>  Br?mha?as are the texts composed in later ages,<br />  compared to Samhit?s, to explain the application of<br />  the samhit?s in rituals and day to day culture. To<br />  simplify the samhit?s, composers of Br?mha?as<br />  adopted several techniques. The composers of<br />  Br?mha?as<br />  of the Vedic literature tried to simplify the<br />  Samhit?s, by prescribing various rites, narrating<br />  myths and describing values.</p>
<p>  The scriptural evidence of impersonality of Br?mha?a<br />  texts is neither found in samhit? nor in Br?mha?a<br />  texts and yet it is a matter of belief in the<br />  tradition. Thus Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and<br />  S?maVeda are the most authentic among all Hindu<br />  scriptures as they are considered to be the<br />  impersonal<br />  wisdom. Therefore these Samhit?s are the main Vedas<br />  for which Br?mha?as become ancillaries.</p>
<p>  Subject matter of the Vedas:<br />  Subject matter of the Vedas is the description of<br />  Devas. Almost all chapters of the Vedas contain<br />  different types of hymns about Devas. It is very<br />  important to know Devas from Vedic point of view.<br />  Devas are not mere persons in the Vedas. Devas are<br />  natural elements around us without which we cannot<br />  live. This is the preliminary understanding about<br />  Devas. Eg: Vayu is the blowing wind; Agni is the<br />  fire;   Varuna is the power in water; Sarasvati, Ganga and<br />  Sindhu are rivers; Indra is thunder and rain; surya<br />  is<br />  sun and Soma is moon. In this way earth, space,<br />  stars,<br />  planets and ocean- everything around us are<br />  considered<br />  as Devas without which we cannot live and therefore<br />  we<br />  are obliged to respect all of them.</p>
<p>  Further in the Vedas these Devas are not only<br />  perceived as natural elements but also as natural<br />  forces that are dwelling in us without which we<br />  cannot<br />  live. Eg: Vayu is the vital energy; Agni is the heat<br />  and sound energy; Varuna represents the energy in<br />  all<br />  fluids etc</p>
<p>  In the deeper sense these Devas are perceived and<br />  understood as the various concepts of cognition or<br />  cognitive powers. This is because each and every<br />  natural element in the external world has become the<br />  symbolic representation or archetypal expression of<br />  the higher and the conceptual and the cognitive<br />  world.<br />  This concrete world is nothing but the manifestation<br />  of the conceptual and cognitive world.</p>
<p>  Eg: Vayu which is blowing wind in the concrete world<br />  represents the core Prana of Psyche and beyond in<br />  cognitive world. Agni which is fire in the gross<br />  world represents the burning will of the Divine that<br />  dwells in the cognitive realm to guide the<br />  aspirants.<br />  Varuna which is the water in gross world, represents<br />  the basic law of universe or the cosmic order in the<br />  cognitive realm. Sarasvati and sindhu which are the<br />  rivers in the gross world represent the flow of<br />  inspiration in the cognitive realm.</p>
<p>  Indra which is the rain and lightning and thunder in<br />  the gross world, represents cognitive strength and<br />  power which destroys all evil forces of the psyche.<br />  Surya &#150; the Sun in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  Self-light or Self- wisdom itself in the inner<br />  world.<br />  Soma &#150; the moon in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  aesthetic flow of Bliss and peace. In this way all<br />  natural elements and forces remain the archetypal<br />  expressions and symbolic manifestations of the<br />  cognitive forces.</p>
<p>  Objective of the Vedas:<br />  Understanding the Self as the fundamental Truth of<br />  the whole existence and to live the life with that<br />  Self as the fundamental principle, is the objective<br />  of<br />  the Vedas. The very nature of this Self is absolute<br />  Silence, peace, bliss and harmony. The Self is pure<br />  conscious Being which is eternal.</p>
<p>  Form the ocean like silent conscious being, wave<br />  like<br />  cognitive powers, tides like natural forces and<br />  bubbles like gross manifestations of natural<br />  elements<br />  occur. As tides, waves and bubbles are not different<br />  from ocean, the Nature &#150; both internal and external<br />  is<br />  not different from the conscious Being.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>  Again Keerthivasan writing:</p>

It even talks about a<br />  different kind of democratic practice. </p>
<p>  To demystify Vedas, we (a small group) are<br />  conducting<br />  lectures, camps etc in many places. On June 2nd, 3rd<br />  and 4th we are having a residential camp on Vedas &amp;   Yoga in Banglore. All are welcome. I am attaching a<br />  word document giving all the details of the camp.</p>

          About Vedas ! ! ! Is this true..........!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi All,<br />I understand that Veda has great principles in it. That doesn't mean that it should be preached here. I think we (Tamils) have rich set of literature which is enough to guide our people. <br />I have few questions.<br />1. Why is 'VEDAS' always learnt or talked about by only certain group of people?<br />2. Why is Sanskrit still used in Temples? Doesn't Tamil contains words to praise God?<br />3. Why does Indian Govt. took such a long time to announce Tamil as a 'Classical Language'?<br />4. Why is certain people (sanskrit) not ready to accept Tamil as root language for all south indian languages (Kannada,Malayalam,Telugu)?</p>
<p>I think this GROUP SHOULD GIVE MORE PREFERENCE TO TAMIL and discuss its heritage. I feel We should not allow to use this forum for the purpose that undermine Tamil in any way directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>One sad thing is even Tamils (not all) are giving due respect to Tamil not to mention about other societies.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Jaga</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hello,</p>
<p>  It is unfortunate that people comment on Vedas<br />  without<br />  proper knowledge or information. Now lets us look<br />  what<br />  are Vedas are about. Sorry its going to be lengthy.</p>
<p>  Vedas are written in highly allegorical language.<br />  That is in a very symbolic language. The word "agni"<br />  means the force in our hearts which propels us to do<br />  good things. Vedic seers were great poets who used<br />  the<br />  outside burning fire (agni) as a symbolic<br />  representation of this burning fire in our hearts do<br />  to good. </p>
<p>  Agni &#150; the divine will:<br />  "Agni is the will of seers; supreme in spiritual<br />  audition; the very truth."<br />  - Rig Veda 1.1.5</p>
<p>  Like this, all the devathas mentioned are inner<br />  forces<br />  within us which We have to cultivate to attain<br />  enlightenment. Veda's subject is Spirituality and<br />  not<br />  rituals as it is popularly believed. In Samhita<br />  portions of Rig there is not a single ritual or a<br />  story given. All these kind of inner forces in us<br />  have<br />  been described and ways are given on how to develop<br />  them to attain enlightenment. </p>
<p>  Lets understand what is Vedas first. Vedas are made<br />  up<br />  of two parts. One is Samhita. Other is brahmana.<br />  Brahmana is again divided into 3 parts, namely<br />  brahmana, aranyaka and upanishads.</p>
<p>  Following lines are from a soon to be published book<br />  on Vedas by Shri R.Rangan:<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />  "Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and S?maVeda are most<br />  original, most authentic and most ancient in the<br />  whole<br />  Vedic literature. It is most authentic because the<br />  Mantras of the Samhit?s are considered to be derived<br />  from the Supreme space of consciousness. Those which<br />  are supposed to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness are considered as more authentic than<br />  those of human authorship."</p>
<p>  According to the RgVeda samhit? it&#146;s Mantras are<br />  considered to be derived from supreme space of<br />  consciousness. In the RgVeda samhit?, there is<br />  mention of YajurVeda samhit? and S?maVeda samhit?   also.</p>
<p>  Thus they are also considered to be most authentic<br />  and evidential. Therefore the samhit?s of RgVeda,<br />  YajurVeda and S?maVeda are considered as the<br />  impersonal wisdom (apaurusheya).</p>
<p>  Samhit?s are the collection of Mantras. These<br />  Mantras<br />  neither narrate stories nor prescribe rituals. Their<br />  subject matter is the description of concepts. The<br />  Samhit? speaks of the subtle concepts of cognition<br />  which are very much useful in the mundane and<br />  spiritual life.</p>
<p>  Br?mha?as are the texts composed in later ages,<br />  compared to Samhit?s, to explain the application of<br />  the samhit?s in rituals and day to day culture. To<br />  simplify the samhit?s, composers of Br?mha?as<br />  adopted several techniques. The composers of<br />  Br?mha?as<br />  of the Vedic literature tried to simplify the<br />  Samhit?s, by prescribing various rites, narrating<br />  myths and describing values.</p>
<p>  The scriptural evidence of impersonality of Br?mha?a<br />  texts is neither found in samhit? nor in Br?mha?a<br />  texts and yet it is a matter of belief in the<br />  tradition. Thus Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and<br />  S?maVeda are the most authentic among all Hindu<br />  scriptures as they are considered to be the<br />  impersonal<br />  wisdom. Therefore these Samhit?s are the main Vedas<br />  for which Br?mha?as become ancillaries.</p>
<p>  Subject matter of the Vedas:<br />  Subject matter of the Vedas is the description of<br />  Devas. Almost all chapters of the Vedas contain<br />  different types of hymns about Devas. It is very<br />  important to know Devas from Vedic point of view.<br />  Devas are not mere persons in the Vedas. Devas are<br />  natural elements around us without which we cannot<br />  live. This is the preliminary understanding about<br />  Devas. Eg: Vayu is the blowing wind; Agni is the<br />  fire;   Varuna is the power in water; Sarasvati, Ganga and<br />  Sindhu are rivers; Indra is thunder and rain; surya<br />  is<br />  sun and Soma is moon. In this way earth, space,<br />  stars,<br />  planets and ocean- everything around us are<br />  considered<br />  as Devas without which we cannot live and therefore<br />  we<br />  are obliged to respect all of them.</p>
<p>  Further in the Vedas these Devas are not only<br />  perceived as natural elements but also as natural<br />  forces that are dwelling in us without which we<br />  cannot<br />  live. Eg: Vayu is the vital energy; Agni is the heat<br />  and sound energy; Varuna represents the energy in<br />  all<br />  fluids etc</p>
<p>  In the deeper sense these Devas are perceived and<br />  understood as the various concepts of cognition or<br />  cognitive powers. This is because each and every<br />  natural element in the external world has become the<br />  symbolic representation or archetypal expression of<br />  the higher and the conceptual and the cognitive<br />  world.<br />  This concrete world is nothing but the manifestation<br />  of the conceptual and cognitive world.</p>
<p>  Eg: Vayu which is blowing wind in the concrete world<br />  represents the core Prana of Psyche and beyond in<br />  cognitive world. Agni which is fire in the gross<br />  world represents the burning will of the Divine that<br />  dwells in the cognitive realm to guide the<br />  aspirants.<br />  Varuna which is the water in gross world, represents<br />  the basic law of universe or the cosmic order in the<br />  cognitive realm. Sarasvati and sindhu which are the<br />  rivers in the gross world represent the flow of<br />  inspiration in the cognitive realm.</p>
<p>  Indra which is the rain and lightning and thunder in<br />  the gross world, represents cognitive strength and<br />  power which destroys all evil forces of the psyche.<br />  Surya &#150; the Sun in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  Self-light or Self- wisdom itself in the inner<br />  world.<br />  Soma &#150; the moon in the gross world is nothing but<br />  the<br />  aesthetic flow of Bliss and peace. In this way all<br />  natural elements and forces remain the archetypal<br />  expressions and symbolic manifestations of the<br />  cognitive forces.</p>
<p>  Objective of the Vedas:<br />  Understanding the Self as the fundamental Truth of<br />  the whole existence and to live the life with that<br />  Self as the fundamental principle, is the objective<br />  of<br />  the Vedas. The very nature of this Self is absolute<br />  Silence, peace, bliss and harmony. The Self is pure<br />  conscious Being which is eternal.</p>
<p>  Form the ocean like silent conscious being, wave<br />  like<br />  cognitive powers, tides like natural forces and<br />  bubbles like gross manifestations of natural<br />  elements<br />  occur. As tides, waves and bubbles are not different<br />  from ocean, the Nature &#150; both internal and external<br />  is<br />  not different from the conscious Being.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>  Again Keerthivasan writing:</p>
<p>  Vedas are the only spiritual book i have seen that<br />  doesn't speak a single word against women. In<br />  Atharva<br />  Veda it says that the King should have army<br />  regiments<br />  made of women. It even makes it very clear that<br />  widow<br />  remarriage can be done. It even talks about a<br />  different kind of democratic practice. </p>
<p>  To demystify Vedas, we (a small group) are<br />  conducting<br />  lectures, camps etc in many places. On June 2nd, 3rd<br />  and 4th we are having a residential camp on Vedas &amp;   Yoga in Banglore. All are welcome. I am attaching a<br />  word document giving all the details of the camp.</p>
<p>  With regards,<br />  Keerthivasan.R</p>

          About Vedas ! ! ! Is this true..........!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hello,</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that people comment on Vedas without<br />proper knowledge or information. Now lets us look what<br />are Vedas are about. Sorry its going to be lengthy.</p>
<p>Vedas are written in highly allegorical language.<br />That is in a very symbolic language. The word "agni"<br />means the force in our hearts which propels us to do<br />good things. Vedic seers were great poets who used the<br />outside burning fire (agni) as a symbolic<br />representation of this burning fire in our hearts do<br />to good. </p>
<p>Agni &#150; the divine will:<br />"Agni is the will of seers; supreme in spiritual<br />audition; the very truth."<br />- Rig Veda 1.1.5</p>
<p>Like this, all the devathas mentioned are inner forces<br />within us which We have to cultivate to attain<br />enlightenment. Veda's subject is Spirituality and not<br />rituals as it is popularly believed. In Samhita<br />portions of Rig there is not a single ritual or a<br />story given. All these kind of inner forces in us have<br />been described and ways are given on how to develop<br />them to attain enlightenment. </p>
<p>Lets understand what is Vedas first. Vedas are made up<br />of two parts. One is Samhita. Other is brahmana.<br />Brahmana is again divided into 3 parts, namely<br />brahmana, aranyaka and upanishads.</p>
<p>Following lines are from a soon to be published book<br />on Vedas by Shri R.Rangan:<br />-----------------------------------------------<br />"Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and S?maVeda are most<br />original, most authentic and most ancient in the whole<br />Vedic literature. It is most authentic because the<br />Mantras of the Samhit?s are considered to be derived<br />from the Supreme space of consciousness. Those which<br />are supposed to be derived from supreme space of<br />consciousness are considered as more authentic than<br />those of human authorship."</p>
<p>According to the RgVeda samhit? it&#146;s Mantras are<br />considered to be derived from supreme space of<br />consciousness. In the RgVeda samhit?, there is<br />mention of YajurVeda samhit? and S?maVeda samhit? also.</p>
<p>Thus they are also considered to be most authentic<br />and evidential. Therefore the samhit?s of RgVeda,<br />YajurVeda and S?maVeda are considered as the<br />impersonal wisdom (apaurusheya).</p>
<p>Samhit?s are the collection of Mantras. These Mantras<br />neither narrate stories nor prescribe rituals. Their<br />subject matter is the description of concepts. The<br />Samhit? speaks of the subtle concepts of cognition<br />which are very much useful in the mundane and<br />spiritual life.</p>
<p>Br?mha?as are the texts composed in later ages,<br />compared to Samhit?s, to explain the application of<br />the samhit?s in rituals and day to day culture. To<br />simplify the samhit?s, composers of Br?mha?as<br />adopted several techniques. The composers of Br?mha?as<br />of the Vedic literature tried to simplify the<br />Samhit?s, by prescribing various rites, narrating<br />myths and describing values.</p>
<p>The scriptural evidence of impersonality of Br?mha?a<br />texts is neither found in samhit? nor in Br?mha?a<br />texts and yet it is a matter of belief in the<br />tradition. Thus Samhit?s of RgVeda, YajurVeda and<br />S?maVeda are the most authentic among all Hindu<br />scriptures as they are considered to be the impersonal<br />wisdom. Therefore these Samhit?s are the main Vedas<br />for which Br?mha?as become ancillaries.</p>
<p>Subject matter of the Vedas:<br />Subject matter of the Vedas is the description of<br />Devas. Almost all chapters of the Vedas contain<br />different types of hymns about Devas. It is very<br />important to know Devas from Vedic point of view.<br />Devas are not mere persons in the Vedas. Devas are<br />natural elements around us without which we cannot<br />live. This is the preliminary understanding about<br />Devas. Eg: Vayu is the blowing wind; Agni is the fire; Varuna is the power in water; Sarasvati, Ganga and<br />Sindhu are rivers; Indra is thunder and rain; surya is<br />sun and Soma is moon. In this way earth, space, stars,<br />planets and ocean- everything around us are considered<br />as Devas without which we cannot live and therefore we<br />are obliged to respect all of them.</p>
<p>Further in the Vedas these Devas are not only<br />perceived as natural elements but also as natural<br />forces that are dwelling in us without which we cannot<br />live. Eg: Vayu is the vital energy; Agni is the heat<br />and sound energy; Varuna represents the energy in all<br />fluids etc</p>
<p>In the deeper sense these Devas are perceived and<br />understood as the various concepts of cognition or<br />cognitive powers. This is because each and every<br />natural element in the external world has become the<br />symbolic representation or archetypal expression of<br />the higher and the conceptual and the cognitive world.<br />This concrete world is nothing but the manifestation<br />of the conceptual and cognitive world.</p>
<p>Eg: Vayu which is blowing wind in the concrete world<br />represents the core Prana of Psyche and beyond in<br />cognitive world. Agni which is fire in the gross<br />world represents the burning will of the Divine that<br />dwells in the cognitive realm to guide the aspirants.<br />Varuna which is the water in gross world, represents<br />the basic law of universe or the cosmic order in the<br />cognitive realm. Sarasvati and sindhu which are the<br />rivers in the gross world represent the flow of<br />inspiration in the cognitive realm.</p>
<p>Indra which is the rain and lightning and thunder in<br />the gross world, represents cognitive strength and<br />power which destroys all evil forces of the psyche.<br />Surya &#150; the Sun in the gross world is nothing but the<br />Self-light or Self- wisdom itself in the inner world.<br />Soma &#150; the moon in the gross world is nothing but the<br />aesthetic flow of Bliss and peace. In this way all<br />natural elements and forces remain the archetypal<br />expressions and symbolic manifestations of the<br />cognitive forces.</p>
<p>Objective of the Vedas:<br />Understanding the Self as the fundamental Truth of<br />the whole existence and to live the life with that<br />Self as the fundamental principle, is the objective of<br />the Vedas. The very nature of this Self is absolute<br />Silence, peace, bliss and harmony. The Self is pure<br />conscious Being which is eternal.</p>
<p>Form the ocean like silent conscious being, wave like<br />cognitive powers, tides like natural forces and<br />bubbles like gross manifestations of natural elements<br />occur. As tides, waves and bubbles are not different<br />from ocean, the Nature &#150; both internal and external is<br />not different from the conscious Being.<br />------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Again Keerthivasan writing:</p>
<p>Vedas are the only spiritual book i have seen that<br />doesn't speak a single word against women. In Atharva<br />Veda it says that the King should have army regiments<br />made of women. It even makes it very clear that widow<br />remarriage can be done. It even talks about a<br />different kind of democratic practice. </p>
<p>To demystify Vedas, we (a small group) are conducting<br />lectures, camps etc in many places. On June 2nd, 3rd<br />and 4th we are having a residential camp on Vedas &amp; Yoga in Banglore. All are welcome. I am attaching a<br />word document giving all the details of the camp.</p>
<p>With regards,<br />Keerthivasan.R</p>

        <p>Its very much evident that this person even dont know the spelling <br />of vedam. sure he has not read even a line from the vedas. Any sane <br />person who can grasp atleast a few words from sanskrit can easily <br />tell that everything written by this person is bullshit. </p>
<p>As the meaning of vedam, history of india are written by the biased <br />europeans, only the biased people writes about vedam.</p>
<p>As sankaran rightly pointed out this is cheap publicity.</p>
