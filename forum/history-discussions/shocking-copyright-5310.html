</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Recently i read the book "Vaanavillai Thediyavan" translated by Puviyarasu, published by Kannadasan Pathippagam, Puplished on 1995. Very intresting story written by James Hotley Chase. while reading the story i thought , i read the same in some where else. finalay i finded out the same story written by aritters "Suba" in one of the their Pocket naval, title is "Indiya Ragasiyam" on later 90's. In above both the stories are same outline, inline, middleline, sideline and etc. lines. i realy shocked the popular writters copied fullstory from english. and also the tamil translated book also copyrighted.<br />how...................? why...............? only these writters or more like this?............ after this i thought i wont read any 'Suba' stories.</p>

In fact i have seen the movie so far around 30 times and still love to see the same . its great team work for Vairamuthu/ Suhasini for dialogues, ARR for Melodius music and Aravindswamy for his excellent playback score and prakashraj and mohanlal for their Splendid action and nasser / rajesh / Aish active paart.</p>
<p>to be frank it is one of the best works of Manirathnam</p>

<p>-Hi <br />a man got out of the theatre during interval in the movie IRUVAR.<br />when asked whether he didnt like the movie he said" i loved it in <br />fact but was afraid to sit alone in the theatre"</p>
<p>true iruvar was a well made movie. but mass opinion went against it.</p>

        <p>Ah, talking of Kuruthipunal, that is again a remake (not inspired) of the hindi film Drokal. But in this case, I feel Kuruthipunal is a better film than the Hindi version with stronger characters, acting and better technical aspects. Kamal has essayed that role very well. The others have performed superbly as well. They have their own distinctive portrayals more than the original film.</p>
<p>Its unfortunate that Kamal could not make a movie out of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . He could have played Vandiyathevan well some 20 years back. Hey thats going back to the time Nayagan was released eh!</p>

<p>-Hi <br />a man got out of the theatre during interval in the movie IRUVAR.<br />when asked whether he didnt like the movie he said" i loved it in <br />fact but was afraid to sit alone in the theatre"</p>
<p>true iruvar was a well made movie. but mass opinion went against it.</p>

<p>  I started the thread only to note that copy/inspiration is not new <br />  and it has been happening for ages. </p>
<p>  Only thing which irks me about Manirathnam is the darkness and <br />  difficulty in hearing his dialogues :) Once it will be <br />  novelty..repeated. ..its irritating.</p>

Without Kalki the glory of the Chola empire would <br />  have<br />    remained in within the confines of the incredibly boring factual <br />  history<br />    books of bearded historians.

          Shocking copy(right)        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Haris Jeyaraj is another music director who can copy huge portions of another song. I was shocked when I heard a song on FM while waiting at a railway reservation. This was an old Hindi song most likely from the 60's and the tune was exactly the same as "oru malai" - Gajini. Recently the song 'June ponaal" is also a lift from the popular current English Hit.</p>

<p>only when he said " you cant negotiate with this man" then the man's <br />death warrant is finalised.<br />bobby's death scene is somewhat common to nayagan also.<br />of course the copy continues.</p>
<p>the split personality of anniyan including the last scene is from <br />sheldon( poor guys has been copied more than anybody else)<br />makkal en pakkam by sathyaraj is also from sheldon.</p>
<p>recently varalaru has a lot of copying from the third twin by follet.</p>
<p>songs you dont have to ask. our directors copy left right and centre.<br />the limit was vettaiyaadu vilaiyaadu " paarththa muthal naalE" is a <br />copy from " yesu piranthaarE"</p>
<p>deva used to copy from his own previous songs. recently i was told <br />that g.v. prakash did the same thing.</p>

<p>    He was affectionately called as VARADHABHAI.. (thus Velu Bhai !)</p>
<p>    He passed away prior to making of this movie. His brother's son<br />    still lives in Chennai. Remember he did some small role in TV<br />    Serial too.</p>
<p>    As righly observed by our Vijay, Padhashree Kamal drew inspiration<br />    from Marlin Brando and thus the traces of GF.</p>
<p>    Naayagan is more or less the biography of Varadhabhai.</p>

<p>Think of it this way-if for instance, Tamil films were to be screened for international merit, I would surely choose movies like Thevar Magan, Virumandi, Autograph, Thavamai Thavamirundhu and such like (movies with more originality and character) than a movie inspired by a very popular other language film. It would hurt me if some one immediately pointed out that this made from that movie.</p>
<p>My displeasure is more in thinking that an actor of Kamal's caliber could have brought out his own mannerism into that character (specially if was written around the Mumbai Don) instead of trying to imitate Brando.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, I dont mind it if they get inspired from English films or songs but I really hate it when anything Hindi is copied into Tamil. I think I will never like G.V Prakash for copying that song (or getting inspired ) from the old Hindi song.</p>

<p>Rahul dhinakaran <rahul.dhinakaran@gmail.com  wrote: hi; talking about inspirations and copycats..there have been numerous discussions in this group about our dear dear <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  being "inspired" by Dumas' Three Musketeers. the first scene, the letter being carried by the hero, his sweetheart being of royal blood, an incredibly beautiful but equally dangerous lady villain, the hero gets smitten by the the same, in both <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  (Karikalan's murder) and 3M (Fleur De Lis) the lady villain has an horrible past, in both these cases Nandini and Milady are affected by a main character in the story etc,etc,etc.. Yevalavo irukku!! </p>
<p>If Nayagan is a copy then <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is also a copy! If people feel bored by Nayagan then so should they with <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . If we are accusing the normal tamil/hindi film goer of not knowing the difference between an old high end English movie and a Kamal hassan starrer then the same accusation stands true here!! </p>
<p>All writers/script writers need inspirations from something. By being inspired by such incredible works they accept the superiority of the other. There is nothing wrong as long as they accept thier story has been inspired. Mani Ratnam and Kamal hassan accepted theirs was inspired..never did deny that. </p>
<p>Godfather is a great piece of art..Nayagan is a good piece</p>
<p>Times Magazine chose this as one of the top 10 movies of all time?! This is news..i dint know this!! </p>

<p>Has anyone seen Sarkar which is stated as many films were inspired by GF this is a tribute to it....and thats more like GF including the Cop in cahoots with the Turk but an excellent performance from AB and AB </p>
<p>btw...Manirathnams first movie in Tamil got this review from AnandaVikatan...Ivarellam padam edukalainnu yaar azhuthathu...The movie is not famous for Manirathnam but Ilayaraja....Yes the Movie is Idayakoil....then happened Mounaragam and rest is history </p>

<p>Nayagan is not a frame by frame copy of God Father...but there are some semblances of God Father like Don's son die of Car accident, and Kamal's m annerisms<br />at times...</p>
<p>PS: It was choosen as one of the best 100 movies ever made by TIME magazine. If it is a copy of God Father it would have never happened..</p>

They are so vivid in my mind even after so many years. When i watched Nayagan in the theater when it was released, I was really bored and couldnt believe that people didnt know that it was more or less a straight lift of the English film. <br /><br />For those who havent seen this movie - Scent of a woman - another exceptional performance by Al Pacino.<br /><br />Best regards<br />Sandeep<br /><br /><br />SatishKumar Arunachalam &lt; <a href="mailto:satisharun@gmail.com">satisharun@gmail.com</a>  wrote: Ah..these are quite common. <br />Manirathinam, who is considered to be one of the best directors in <br />Industry got inspired (this is the word used for 'copy' in India) only <br />by Hollywood movies.

<p>The Tamils lived in Bombay (Mumbai) Tharavi (slums populated with <br />more of the poor Tamils of southern TN) was given protection by one <br />VARADHARAJAN during 1960s / 70s.</p>
<p>He was affectionately called as VARADHABHAI.. (thus Velu Bhai !)</p>
<p>He passed away prior to making of this movie. His brother's son <br />still lives in Chennai. Remember he did some small role in TV <br />Serial too.</p>
<p>As righly observed by our Vijay, Padhashree Kamal drew inspiration <br />from Marlin Brando and thus the traces of GF.  </p>
<p>Naayagan is more or less the biography of Varadhabhai.</p>
<p>There were Hindi movies related to Bombay Dock-Labour (Koolie .. <br />etc., ) which were also successful. Thus " Dhayavan."</p>

        <p>True Rahul,</p>
<p>One sunny day, we went to Gangai Konda choza puram, and friend of mine asked me something about cholas..I have told him a lot regarding cholas..In the midst of narrating, i realized what i was telling is actually extracted from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  by Mr.Kalki. </p>
<p>Then only i realized, <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  was so close to our heart that we just keep thinking whatever told in the story is true...A great acheivement indeed by Mr.Kalki.</p>

Sometimes nature lends a helping hand as in the the acse of the Eiffel Tower whose comlex framework was inspired by the complex honeycomb of the human bone!! <br />The glorious arches in all our muslim tombs, hindu temples, christian churches have been inspred by the most humblest of nature's marvels...the egg!!<br />Dumas,Kalki,Coppola,Mani ratnam are all great minds and should be respected for what they have done rather than nit-picking thier works. </rahul.dhinakaran@gmail.com></p>
<p>Remember, Kalki has bought the glory of the Chola empire to door steps of the common man. Without Kalki the glory of the Chola empire would have remained in within the confines of the incredibly boring factual history books of bearded historians. He made an entire generation of tamils aware of their past glory. </p>

<p>Rahul<br />three musketeers as a book itself is a copy. there was a published<br />book on the same story in a french library. it was borrowed by one Mr.<br />dumas who has still failed to return it. The book was borrowed from<br />the Marseille public library, and the card-index remains to this day; Dumas kept the book when he went back to Paris.</p>
<p>the line is very thin between plagarism and creativity.</p>
<p>for instance " the life of PI" which won the man booker award last<br />year was a copy of another novel published. when asked about it the<br />award winning writer yann martel had the audacity to say " just<br />because a story was handled earlier by a mediocre mind , it doesnt<br />mean a better writer should not use it.</p>

<p>Nayagan is not a frame by frame copy of God Father...but there are some semblances of God Father like Don's son die of Car accident, and Kamal's m annerisms<br />at times...</p>
<p>PS: It was choosen as one of the best 100 movies ever made by TIME magazine. If it is a copy of God Father it would have never happened..</p>
<p>Nayagan's some scenes resembles "Once upon time in America.".. </p>

        <p>Oops! Such a long thread.</p>
<p>Inspiration / copied You can actually see the difference. Ilayaraja - My<br />favorite composed music for the song Kann Malargalin Azhaipidhazh ... Which<br />is an inspiration of Money Money Money (ABBA) Thats inspiration. Talking<br />tangentially - Do visit the below mentioned site to see the difference<br />between inspiration and copy - In Tamil Music</p>
<p><a href="http://www.itwofs.com/tamil-ir.html" title="http://www.itwofs.com/tamil-ir.html">http://www.itwofs.com/tamil-ir.html</a></p>
<p>Coming back to the main discussion -- Doing some tinkering work here and<br />there (Read: Adding deleting a few characters here and there) on a full<br />fledged original story and presenting them is NOT inspiration. For example<br />P.Vasu still says that Chandramukhi is an inspiration from "Manichitra<br />Taazhu", which I don't agree. Split personality is the theme and he has<br />added few charecters here and there (Vijayakumar / Nayan Thara / Vadivelu /<br />his wife charecters are not there in the Malayalam original) But you cant<br />claim that its an inspiration</p>
<p>Manirathnam got inspired by the short story of Sujatha and directed a full<br />fledged movie called "Kannathil Muthamittal" The story appears in the<br />Sujatha Sirukadhai Toguppu, Real signs of me getting old, I am unable to<br />remember the name of the story. The story is something like this - A Tamil<br />rebel - a suicide bomber, killing the army official. The kid of an Indian<br />writer has a small chat with him minutes before he does this act.This is<br />inspiration.</p>
<p>Real life inspirations are different. Iruvar is one good example, it<br />happened in real life and it has been modified and made into a film.<br />Acceptable! Infact Nayagan is a mixure of God Father and real life story of<br />Vardha Bhai (Varadharaja Mudaliyar) the first don of Bombay Kamal adapted<br />some mannerisms of Marlon Brando ... Like scratching his head and then<br />adjusting his hair and also the voice modulation and all resembled God<br />father.</p>
<p>Cant blame the Tamil story tellers also. oru oorla oru yezhai paiyyan oru<br />panakaara ponnu avangalukku nadula kadhal OR Parambara parambaraya Kudumba<br />Sandai and there is a love between the boy from one family and girl from<br />other family. In fact thats the reason why people like Kamal / Mani Ratnam<br />started writing stories. Again its not my imagination, Kamal himself<br />disclosed this one interview. With all respects to the success rate of<br />director Shankar -- He is having only one story -- Larger than life<br />charecter come out to save / do good to the society Gentleman / Indian /<br />Mudhalvan / Anniyan / Shivaji ... The way he tells the story is good ... I<br />need not say that the success of the above mentioned movies say that</p>
<p>Well first thing in the morning I am typing such a long mail and my manager<br />is looking from his place for quite sometime now. ... Will join at a later<br />stage ... Have a great day guys!</p>

As you said, Kalki brought Chola's to the doorstep of every <br />tamil. Mani rathnam and Kamal has taken Tamil movies to great <br />hights, for which they should be respected.</p>
<p>I started the thread only to note that copy/inspiration is not new <br />and it has been happening for ages. </p>
<p>Only thing which irks me about Manirathnam is the darkness and <br />difficulty in hearing his dialogues :) Once it will be <br />novelty..repeated...its irritating.</p>

<p>  Remember, Kalki has bought the glory of the Chola empire to door <br />steps of<br />  the common man. Without Kalki the glory of the Chola empire would <br />have<br />  remained in within the confines of the incredibly boring factual <br />history<br />  books of bearded historians.

        <p>i loved mario puzo, i liked watching god father after reading the <br />novel - like nayagan also - not sure if the average tamil movie goer <br />would sit though god father though. in that way the film justified <br />its draw.</p>
<p>However, saying that - kamal is a versatile actor - but in nayagan - <br />the greezed tightly combed hair, the protruding jaw line and the <br />dialogue delviery were straight picks from brando.</p>

<p>Rahul<br />three musketeers as a book itself is a copy. there was a published<br />book on the same story in a french library. it was borrowed by one Mr.<br />dumas who has still failed to return it. The book was borrowed from<br />the Marseille public library, and the card-index remains to this day; Dumas kept the book when he went back to Paris.</p>
<p>the line is very thin between plagarism and creativity.</p>
<p>for instance " the life of PI" which won the man booker award last<br />year was a copy of another novel published. when asked about it the<br />award winning writer yann martel had the audacity to say " just<br />because a story was handled earlier by a mediocre mind , it doesnt<br />mean a better writer should not use it.</p>

<p>  If Nayagan is a copy then PS is also a copy! If people feel bored <br />by Nayagan<br />  then so should they with PS. If we are accusing the normal tamil/<br />hindi film<br />  goer of not knowing the difference between an old high end English <br />movie and<br />  a Kamal hassan starrer then the same accusation stands true here!!</p>
<p>  All writers/script writers need inspirations from something. By <br />being<br />  inspired by such incredible works they accept the superiority of <br />the other.<br />  There is nothing wrong as long as they accept thier story has been <br />inspired.<br />  Mani Ratnam and Kamal hassan accepted theirs was inspired..never <br />did deny<br />  that.</p>

        <p>incredibly boring factual history</p>
<blockquote><p>  books of bearded historians.</p></blockquote>
<p>dear rahul</p>
<p>I had the good fortune ( thanks to sps sir) of hosting two of them <br />last evening - two legends, greats in their own right....Dr. Nagaswamy <br />and Munaivar Kudavoil Balu sirs. i dont think you can term their <br />life's essense boring - to the uninitiated yes, and to that extent i <br />give credit to kalki - for initiating the masses ( including me, <br />however without their yeoman service ( many times thankless) the novel <br />would have just been fiction and am afraid it would have lost it charm <br />without the delicate interwining of fact with fiction. imagine the <br />innumerable hours of back breaking work not just in unearthing the <br />inscriptions but painstaking work in deciphering them. mr balu sir, <br />shared just four pages of his recent work with me, will seek his <br />permission before discussing more on it, but the depth and passion in <br />that article left me speechless, spellbound, sleepless ....no <br />words,wealth can do justice to their noble deeds.</p>

        <p>I feel there is nothing wrong in writing or directing inspired pieces as<br />long as they accept that it has been inspired. Infact all graert works in<br />architecture,engineering, art have been inspired by one thing or the other.<br />Sometimes nature lends a helping hand as in the the acse of the Eiffel Tower<br />whose comlex framework was inspired by the complex honeycomb of the human<br />bone!!<br />The glorious arches in all our muslim tombs, hindu temples, christian<br />churches have been inspred by the most humblest of nature's marvels...the<br />egg!!<br />Dumas,Kalki,Coppola,Mani ratnam are all great minds and should be respected<br />for what they have done rather than nit-picking thier works.</p>
<p>Remember, Kalki has bought the glory of the Chola empire to door steps of<br />the common man. Without Kalki the glory of the Chola empire would have<br />remained in within the confines of the incredibly boring factual history<br />books of bearded historians. He made an entire generation of tamils aware of<br />their past glory.</p>

          Shocking copy(right)        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>hi; talking about inspirations and copycats..there have been numerous<br />discussions in this group about our dear dear <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  being "inspired" by Dumas'<br />Three Musketeers. the first scene, the letter being carried by the hero, his<br />sweetheart being of royal blood, an incredibly beautiful but equally<br />dangerous lady villain, the hero gets smitten by the the same, in both <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym <br />(Karikalan's murder) and 3M (Fleur De Lis) the lady villain has an horrible<br />past, in both these cases Nandini and Milady are affected by a main<br />character in the story etc,etc,etc.. Yevalavo irukku!!</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>If Nayagan is a copy then <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is also a copy! If people feel bored by Nayagan<br />then so should they with <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . If we are accusing the normal tamil/hindi film<br />goer of not knowing the difference between an old high end English movie and<br />a Kamal hassan starrer then the same accusation stands true here!!</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>All writers/script writers need inspirations from something. By being<br />inspired by such incredible works they accept the superiority of the other.<br />There is nothing wrong as long as they accept thier story has been inspired.<br />Mani Ratnam and Kamal hassan accepted theirs was inspired..never did deny<br />that.</p>
<p>Godfather is a great piece of art..Nayagan is a good piece</p>
<p>Times Magazine chose this as one of the top 10 movies of all time?! This is<br />news..i dint know this!!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All<br />  I agree with Vijay<br />  Nayagan wasnt a frameby frame copy...it was inspired....having read GF and<br />  seen it numerous times I think its not a copy...</p>
<p>  Has anyone seen Sarkar which is stated as many films were inspired by GF<br />  this is a tribute to it....and thats more like GF including the Cop in<br />  cahoots with the Turk but an excellent performance from AB and AB</p>
<p>  btw...Manirathnams first movie in Tamil got this review from<br />  AnandaVikatan...Ivarellam padam edukalainnu yaar azhuthathu...The movie is<br />  not famous for Manirathnam but Ilayaraja....Yes the Movie is<br />  Idayakoil....then happened Mounaragam and rest is history</p>

        <p>A clarification for Nayagan. Maniratnam used the word Adaptation<br />rather than inspired. Even in the Times<br />magazine, where Nayagan was the only indian movie in the top 100, it<br />is stated as Adaptation of God Father.<br />There are many who copied and have claimed to be inspired, don't<br />include Manirathnam in that list. He is real brillant.</p>

        <p>Ah..these are quite common. <br />Manirathinam, who is considered to be one of the best directors in <br />Industry got inspired (this is the word used for 'copy' in India) only <br />by Hollywood movies. Only recently I happened to see Godfather. My god <br />Nayagan is a frame by frame copy of many scenes from Godfather. </p>
