<p>The tale of a broken pot </p>
<p>Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal </p>
<p>? Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology </p>
<p>The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum. </p>
<p>Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about eighteen <br />hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud owner was a <br />toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the edge of <br />the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of Tamil <br />Nadu). </p>
<p>Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by taking <br />on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the <br />toddy. </p>
<p>There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would climb the <br />trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of the trees <br />with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to collect <br />the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings. </p>
<p>The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a few days <br />to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a <br />good market.</p>
<p>Etched belongings </p>
<p>Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to <br />identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this message on <br />it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly tapped <br />toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to <br />oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>Determining age </p>
<p>Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a couple <br />of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of my body, <br />that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists (who <br />study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my shoulder <br />as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same <br />period.</p>
<p>And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an important <br />message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the <br />ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a remote <br />hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could write down <br />his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not <br />discarded like other broken pottery!</p>
<p>Iravatham Mahadevan is a well-known researcher of the Indus and <br />Brahmi scripts. Dr. S. Rajagopal is a senior archaeologist <br />specialising in Old Tamil inscriptions, who retired from the Tamil <br />Nadu State Department of Archaeology. </p>

<p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>I can write about the Tamil-Brahmi (TB) script as I did lot of study <br />on this in the past.</p>
<p>May be we can organize a scholarly meeting with I. Mahadevan. Our <br />group members will be happy to meet him.</p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>Dear Venkateswaran,</p>
<p>I am aware of your capability. That is an indirect request.  </p>
<p>Pls write in detail on these matters so that members, when meet Dr. <br />Iravatham, seek clarifications as he also would be feeling happy <br />that several persons have taken interest and familiarised themselves <br />with his monumental work.</p>
<p>thanks and regards / sps</p>

<p>  Take time to read the below articles:</p>

<p>  I guess in ancient India ( atleast in Tamilnadu ) the Gurukul system was<br />  wide open to all walks of people... See the list of Cankam poets who come<br />  from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>  You are right in one way. Many Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions are written in<br />  slang when compared with the Tamil of the Cankam poetry. Mayilai Seeni<br />  Venkatasamy observes that this was a practice during those times. The other<br />  interpretation could be that these scribes had very bad language practice.</p>
<p>  There was no other script in practice ( from the evidence so far ) during<br />  the Cankam period. There is some or little evidence to trace the evolution<br />  of the Brahmi script form the late Harappan (Indus) script and there is lot<br />  of evidence to prove the evolution of current Tamil script from the Brahmi<br />  script ( see for example Mr. Vairam's recent postings on Lord Murugan where<br />  he has posted this evolution as images on the top of the screen. )</p>
<p>  Hope this helps!</p>

<p>  I agree that toddy gatherers among themselves should be able to read,<br />  which the reason it was scribed...</p>
<p>  I would really be proud if education was very prevalent in ancient times in<br />  tamilnadu.</p>
<p>  Having said those, I still feel that this cannot substansiate the fact that<br />  literacy rate was high in those times.</p>
<p>  For example, consider this:<br />  In current times, with so many boards and hoardings (that display alphabets<br />  basically), with a widespread and highly available education system, we<br />  still come across people who cannot even string letters together. Even with<br />  the absence of a formal education, the huge need to constantly decipher<br />  words can still make illiterate people a little more language oriented<br />  nowadays.</p>
<p>  Things must have been very different in the 3rd century AD. Education was<br />  limited to certain classes, with gurukula being the primary form of formal<br />  education (am assuming this, please correct me if I am wrong), and very<br />  little artificial signboards, the necessity to decipher letters of any form<br />  would have been very minimal. So, with no formal education, most of such<br />  people would have no need at all to encounter any form of literature. Which<br />  is probably why education is given so much importance in our culture (naalu<br />  ezhuthhu padichavan). These people would probably not even feel the pinchof<br />  not knowing the alphabets, because the lifestyle would not have required<br />  them to - This is my humble opinion.</p>
<p>  These are the reasons am skeptical about concluding that toddy-gatherers<br />  would be educated - or that the society in general would be highly literate<br />  based on just this artifact. Probably Iravatham sir might have seen more<br />  that might have led him to conclude so. This is not mentioned in the<br />  article.</p>
<p>  Another possibility could be that there were two forms of writing - one<br />  commonly and colloquially used among the masses, and another elite language.</p>
<p>  We constantly see such occurings even today - tamil is the common language<br />  while english is (kinda) the elitist language in our society today. I hear<br />  latin education was considered elitist and a compulsory subject (even though<br />  it did not have any practical usage) till sometime last century in many<br />  universities - english then being the common language in UK/US.</p>
<p>  Could it be that tamilbramhi was the commoners language which was widely<br />  prevalent - which required little or no formal education, while there was<br />  another form of elitist tamil/other languages/script?</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Madan.</p>

<p>   Hi Madan,</p>
<p>   If you have your name engraved in German in your iPod, probably you<br />   atleast know how to read it!</p>
<p>   It makes sense to believe that the potter scribed the pot.</p>
<p>   Either way, the potter's ability to scribe and Naakan's ability to read in<br />   a remote 2000 year old village is astonishing. It just emphasises the kind<br />   of governace and education system our ancestors had.</p>
<p>   There are other even much old scribing - for example the Sulur ( near<br />   Coimbatore ) plate in London Museum bearing late Indus script and the<br />   Sembiankandiyur stone axe with the same Indus script are acknowledged by<br />   scholars. There are thousands of pot shreds unearthed with graffitti and<br />   Indus / Brahmi letters.</p>
<p>   So the literacy tradition in India was too ancient. We need not be<br />   surprised even if Naakan ( or was he Nakkan ? ) himself scribed the pot!</p>
<p>   Best regards,</p>

<p>    The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>    Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>
<p>    ? Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology</p>
<p>    The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>    Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about eighteen<br />    hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud owner was a<br />    toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the edge of<br />    the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of Tamil<br />    Nadu).</p>
<p>    Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by taking<br />    on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the<br />    toddy.</p>
<p>    There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would climb the<br />    trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of the trees<br />    with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to collect<br />    the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>    The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a few days<br />    to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a<br />    good market.</p>
<p>    Etched belongings</p>
<p>    Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to<br />    identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this message on<br />    it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>    naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>    The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly tapped<br />    toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />    oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>    Determining age</p>
<p>    Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a couple<br />    of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of my body,<br />    that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists (who<br />    study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my shoulder<br />    as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same<br />    period.</p>
<p>    And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an important<br />    message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the<br />    ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a remote<br />    hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could write down<br />    his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>    That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />    discarded like other broken pottery!</p>
<p>    Iravatham Mahadevan is a well-known researcher of the Indus and<br />    Brahmi scripts. Dr. S. Rajagopal is a senior archaeologist<br />    specialising in Old Tamil inscriptions, who retired from the Tamil<br />    Nadu State Department of Archaeology.</p>

See the list of Cankam poets who come from different backgrounds.</P <br /></p><P &nbsp;</P <br /></p><P You are right in one way. Many Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions are written in slang when compared with the Tamil of the Cankam poetry. Mayilai Seeni Venkatasamy observes that this was a practice during those times. The other interpretation could be that these scribes had very bad language practice.</P <br /></p><P &nbsp;</P <br /></p><P There was no other script in practice ( from the evidence so far ) during the Cankam period.&nbsp; There is some or little&nbsp;evidence to&nbsp;trace the evolution of the Brahmi script form the late Harappan (Indus) script and there is lot of evidence to prove the evolution of current Tamil script from the Brahmi script ( see for example Mr. Vairam's recent postings onLord Murugan where he has posted this evolution as images on the top of the screen. )</P <br /></p><P &nbsp;</P <br /></p><P Hope this helps!</P <br /></p><P &nbsp;</P <br /></p><P Best regards,<BR <BR --- On <B Wed, 5/14/08, Madan U Sreenivasan <I &lt;madanus@gmail.com&gt;</I </B  wrote:<BR </P <br /><BLOCKQUOTE style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid" From: Madan U Sreenivasan &lt;madanus@gmail.com&gt;<BR Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] how literate can a toddy gather be in ancient india<BR To: ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com<BR Date: Wednesday, May 14, 2008, 10:13 AM<BR <BR <br /><DIV id=yiv2128394659 <br /><DIV id=ygrp-text <br /><P I agree that toddy gatherers among themselves should be able to read, which the reason it was scribed...<BR <BR I would really be proud if education was very prevalent in ancient times in tamilnadu. <BR <BR Having said those, I still feel that this cannot substansiate the fact that literacy rate was high in those times.<BR <BR For example, consider this:<BR In current times, with so many boards and hoardings (that display alphabets basically),with a widespread and highly available education system, we still come across people who cannot even string letters together. Even with the absence of a formal education, the huge need to constantly decipher words can still make illiterate people a little more language oriented nowadays.<BR <BR Things must have been very different in the 3rd century AD. Education was limited to certain classes, with gurukula being the primary form of formal education (am assuming this, please correct me if I am wrong), and very<br />little artificial signboards, the necessity to decipher letters of any form would have been very minimal. So, with no formal education, most of such people would have no need at all to encounter any form of literature. Whichis probably why education is given so much importance in our culture (naalu ezhuthhu padichavan). These people would probably not even feel the pinchof not knowing the alphabets, because the lifestyle would not have required them to - This is my humble opinion.<BR <BR These are the reasons am skeptical about concluding that toddy-gatherers would be educated - or that thesociety in general would be highly literate based on just this artifact. Probably Iravatham sir might have seen more that might have led him to conclude so. This is not mentioned in the article.<BR <BR Another possibility could be that there were two forms of writing - one commonly and colloquiallyused among the masses, and another elite language.<BR <BR We<br />constantly see such occurings even today - tamil is the common language while english is (kinda) the elitist language in our society today. I hear latin education was considered elitist and a compulsory subject (even though it did not have any practical usage) till sometime last century in many universities - english then being the common language in UK/US.<BR <BR Could it be that tamilbramhi was the commoners language which was widely prevalent- which required little or no formal education, while there was another form of elitist tamil/other languages/script?<BR <BR Regards,<BR Madan.<BR <BR <br /><DIV class=gmail_quote On Wed, May 14, 2008 at 9:17 AM, Venkateswaran K &lt;<A href="mailto:vkasirajan@yahoo.com" target=_blank rel=nofollow vkasirajan@yahoo. com</A &gt; wrote:<BR <br /><BLOCKQUOTE class=gmail_quote style="BORDER-LEFT: rgb(204,204,204) 1px solid" <br /><DIV style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)" <br /><DIV <br /><DIV <br /><DIV <br /><P </P <br /><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0 <br /><TBODY <br /><TR <br /><TD style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch:inherit" <br /><P Hi Madan,</P <br /></p><P &nbsp;</P <br /></p><P If you have your name engraved in German in your iPod, probably you atleast know how to read it!</P <br /></p><P &nbsp;</P <br /></p><P It makes sense to believe that the potter scribed the pot.</P <br /></p><P &nbsp;</P <br /></p><P Either way, the potter's ability to scribe and Naakan's ability to read in a remote 2000 year old village is astonishing.

<p>You too Vijay .. ! Nice.</p>
<p>Okay .. on a serious note ::</p>
<p>Myself and Venkateswararn Kasirajan visited the exclusive exhibition <br />of Adichanallur finds in <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym , Fort Chennai - ( about 6 months back).. <br />but we were very late on the last day. It was closed. Using some help <br />we managed to peep in to see certain items. ( I remember to have <br />posted the details too in our Group).</acronym></p>
<p>After a couple of months, in varalaaru, I remember to have read an <br />article related to Embossed inscriptions on Pot finds of Adichanllur <br />and cedrtain secrets shrouded around those ..</p>
<p>Now there is another News item in Dinamalar -by TKV Rajan - that <br />Adichanallur expeditions are being wound-up.. and to be taken up..</p>
<p>Media Personality CR Baskaran " Needhiyin Kural" is planning to come <br />up with a Live telecast on these developments in VINN TV on Friday, <br />the 16th May.</p>
<p>I request Vijay, Venkateswaran and other members to furnish some <br />synopsis on ::</p>
<p>1. TAMIL BRAHMI and the details.. like how does vary from Tamil ? <br />Whether Tamil Literatures of that age were written in that script or <br />so.. etc.</p>
<p>2. Achichanallur ,, synopsis .. When the site was found.. What was the <br />finds from the British Archeologists.. Interesting informations (Like <br />Naazi Hitler sent his emissary to find some first hand details from <br />Adichanallur etc).. Almost after 100 years when the second excavation <br />was made.. who were sponsible... what were found.. </p>
<p>Even relevant links will do ..</p>
<p>and thirdly, </p>
<p>3. NAKKAN .. In tamil inscriptions how this term is used ..</p>
<p>this can form some frame work for archiving for future reference.</p>

<blockquote><p>  on a lighter note:<br />  For all we know it might even be the earliest form of branding of <br />products..<br />  May be Naakan's Toddy was a big brand.. Just like we have pepsi <br />trucks and<br />  containers.. naakan might have had his own branding to stand out of <br />the<br />  rest..

<blockquote><p>    Hi,<br />  This is my perspective of the event, toddy pots are usually tied to<br />  coconut or palm trees and are removed when it needs to drunk. I have<br />  seen this in lot of movies!....<br />  So basically pot which is tied over the tree has these<br />  inscriptions. We usually know that coconut fields are very big and<br />  coconut trees close to each other. There might be many toddy<br />  collectors using the same farm. SO there might be a need to identify<br />  whose pot was up in the tree since some times it might be confusing to<br />  identify the right tree.<br />  So the identity can be in any form...may be a paint or some mark<br />  or coloured cloth around it etc. and every body who were using the<br />  farm should be aware of that sign and recognize whose pot it is.<br />  Here instead of any obscure symbol they have used the alphabets<br />  itself, it means every body using the farm should have been able to<br />  identify what was inscribed in it.<br />  This is an indicator that people working in the farm were literate<br />  enough to understand what was written on the pot.</p>

<p>        For example, consider this:<br />        In current times, with so many boards and hoardings (that display<br />      alphabets<br />        basically), with a widespread and highly available education<br />  system, we<br />        still come across people who cannot even string letters<br />  together. Even<br />      with<br />        the absence of a formal education, the huge need to constantly<br />  decipher<br />        words can still make illiterate people a little more language<br />  oriented<br />        nowadays.</p>
<p>      *Right! But remember, this is what we see today. But regarding the<br />  ancient<br />      times, do we have any photos to see how things were? No, right? It is<br />      deciphered only based on certain historical evidences like, copper<br />  plate,<br />      stone inscriptions, travellers accounts etc. Forget the copper<br />  plates and<br />      stone inscriptions for the moment. Atleast certain travellers<br />  accounts like<br />      Al-Beruni, Huen Tsang talk very highly about the literacy rates<br />  prevalent<br />      then. *</p>
<p>      *And dont you think, the reason for present day illiteracy are only<br />      because of the politicians, who wants to maintain the status kuo<br />  of the<br />      illiterates (pAmarans), to gain a mileage for their vote banks,<br />  as, if those<br />      masses are really literate, all these politicians' cheat games will be<br />      exposed? *</p>
<p>      *This is a basic difference between the present day and ancient<br />  day, when<br />      those rulers were really interested in the upliftment of their<br />  subjects.<br />      Interestingly, I would say that the poor picture painted about the<br />  toddy<br />      fetcher is only a perspective from a present day situation, as<br />  that is what<br />      we see. Who knows, the ancient times toddy fetcher could have been<br />  much well<br />      off. Remember that the story is deciphered only based on Two<br />  Words, just<br />      Two Words that is "naakan URal". Irukkara kOttula nAma rOdu<br />  pOtturukkOm....<br />      avvaLavudhAn.*</p>
<p>        Things must have been very different in the 3rd century AD.<br />  Education<br />      was<br />        limited to certain classes, with gurukula being the primary form of<br />      formal<br />        education (am assuming this, please correct me if I am wrong),<br />  and very<br />        little artificial signboards, the necessity to decipher letters<br />  of any<br />      form<br />        would have been very minimal. So, with no formal education, most<br />  of such<br />        people would have no need at all to encounter any form of<br />  literature.<br />      Which<br />        is probably why education is given so much importance in our culture<br />      (naalu<br />        ezhuthhu padichavan). These people would probably not even feel the<br />      pinch of<br />        not knowing the alphabets, because the lifestyle would not have<br />  required<br />        them to - This is my humble opinion.</p>
<p>      *I am asking this question, out of true ignorance. Except certain<br />  works by<br />      the invading English, who did a lot of work to divide and rule the<br />  people,<br />      are a there any inscriptions or copper plate or travellers account<br />  which<br />      says that education was restricted to certain classes and<br />  available only for<br />      certain elite classes? I am not challenging here, but I am only<br />  questioning<br />      to understand better. And please do not bring documents like Manu<br />  Smriti.<br />      Let us rely only on copper plates, stone inscriptions and traveller's<br />      account, as manu smriti is a much adulterated work, atleast the<br />  copies that<br />      we have today.*</p>
<p>      *It is true that certain education was restricted to certain<br />  classes, but<br />      that does not mean that those classes were really deprived of a basic<br />      education to read, write and account. I am pretty sure, atleast, I<br />  have not<br />      come across any account which subscribes to this view. Please<br />  correct me if<br />      I am wrong.<br />      *</p>
<p>        These are the reasons am skeptical about concluding that<br />  toddy-gatherers<br />        would be educated - or that the society in general would be highly<br />      literate<br />        based on just this artifact. Probably Iravatham sir might have<br />  seen more<br />        that might have led him to conclude so. This is not mentioned in the<br />        article.</p>
<p>      *I believe that Iravatham sir, had seen the other side of logical<br />      reasoning and that is why he might have concluded that the<br />  literacy rates<br />      were so great in older days. Remember the words of Macaulay, doing<br />  rounds in<br />      e-mail, in which he claims about the greatness of India and how<br />  one need to<br />      divide us first, to plunder us later, in which they were indeed<br />  successful.<br />      *</p>
<p>        Another possibility could be that there were two forms of<br />  writing - one<br />        commonly and colloquially used among the masses, and another elite<br />      language.</p>
<p>      *Well. This is a certain possibility. I agree. That is what I<br />  said, while<br />      certain education was restricted to certain classes, the basic<br />  education was<br />      avaiable for everyone.*</p>
<p>      *I have only placed certain arguments based on my limited<br />  understanding. I<br />      request our learned members to correct me wherever I am wrong. *</p>
<p>      *Regards,*</p>
<p>      *Venkatesh*</p>
<p>        We constantly see such occurings even today - tamil is the common<br />      language<br />        while english is (kinda) the elitist language in our society<br />  today. I<br />      hear<br />        latin education was considered elitist and a compulsory subject<br />  (even<br />      though<br />        it did not have any practical usage) till sometime last century<br />  in many<br />        universities - english then being the common language in UK/US.</p>
<p>        Could it be that tamilbramhi was the commoners language which<br />  was widely<br />        prevalent - which required little or no formal education, while<br />  there<br />      was<br />        another form of elitist tamil/other languages/script?</p>

<p>          Hi Madan,</p>
<p>          If you have your name engraved in German in your iPod,<br />  probably you<br />          atleast know how to read it!</p>
<p>          It makes sense to believe that the potter scribed the pot.</p>
<p>          Either way, the potter's ability to scribe and Naakan's ability to<br />      read in<br />          a remote 2000 year old village is astonishing. It just<br />  emphasises the<br />      kind<br />          of governace and education system our ancestors had.</p>
<p>          There are other even much old scribing - for example the Sulur<br />  ( near<br />          Coimbatore ) plate in London Museum bearing late Indus script<br />  and the<br />          Sembiankandiyur stone axe with the same Indus script are<br />  acknowledged<br />      by<br />          scholars. There are thousands of pot shreds unearthed with<br />  graffitti<br />      and<br />          Indus / Brahmi letters.</p>
<p>          So the literacy tradition in India was too ancient. We need not be<br />          surprised even if Naakan ( or was he Nakkan ? ) himself<br />  scribed the<br />      pot!</p>

<p>            The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>            Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>
<p>            â€" Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology</p>
<p>            The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>            Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about<br />  eighteen<br />            hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud<br />  owner was a<br />            toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the<br />  edge of<br />            the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of<br />  Tamil<br />            Nadu).</p>
<p>            Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by<br />  taking<br />            on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the<br />            toddy.</p>
<p>            There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would<br />  climb the<br />            trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of<br />  the trees<br />            with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to<br />  collect<br />            the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>            The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a<br />  few days<br />            to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a<br />            good market.</p>
<p>            Etched belongings</p>
<p>            Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to<br />            identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this<br />  message on<br />            it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>            naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>            The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly<br />  tapped<br />            toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />            oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>            Determining age</p>
<p>            Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a<br />  couple<br />            of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of<br />  my body,<br />            that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists<br />  (who<br />            study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my<br />  shoulder<br />            as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same<br />            period.</p>
<p>            And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an<br />  important<br />            message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the<br />            ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a<br />  remote<br />            hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could<br />  write down<br />            his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>            That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />            discarded like other broken pottery!</p>

Rajagopal is a senior archaeologist<br />            specialising in Old Tamil inscriptions, who retired from the<br />  Tamil<br />            Nadu State Department of Archaeology.</p>

        <p>Vijay,</p>
<p>I think its not literally leasing of an earthen pot.<br />Lets say there where 4-5 toddy makers in the village.. The pot might be just<br />a identification of a particular cultivator.. say he had 100 palm trees, May<br />be there where a hundred earthen pots with the inscription "naakan URal" to<br />mark his trees and pots and differentiate them from the rest.</p>
<p>on a lighter note:<br />For all we know it might even be the earliest form of branding of products..<br />May be Naakan's Toddy was a big brand.. Just like we have pepsi trucks and<br />containers.. naakan might have had his own branding to stand out of the<br />rest.. Its amazing how a two liner can be interpreted into n different<br />meaning..</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi, <br />This is my perspective of the event, toddy pots are usually tied to<br />coconut or palm trees and are removed when it needs to drunk. I have<br />seen this in lot of movies!....<br />So basically pot which is tied over the tree has these<br />inscriptions. We usually know that coconut fields are very big and<br />coconut trees close to each other. There might be many toddy<br />collectors using the same farm. SO there might be a need to identify<br />whose pot was up in the tree since some times it might be confusing to<br />identify the right tree.<br />So the identity can be in any form...may be a paint or some mark<br />or coloured cloth around it etc. and every body who were using the<br />farm should be aware of that sign and recognize whose pot it is.<br />Here instead of any obscure symbol they have used the alphabets<br />itself, it means every body using the farm should have been able to<br />identify what was inscribed in it.<br />This is an indicator that people working in the farm were literate<br />enough to understand what was written on the pot.</p>

<p>      For example, consider this:<br />      In current times, with so many boards and hoardings (that display<br />    alphabets<br />      basically), with a widespread and highly available education<br />system, we<br />      still come across people who cannot even string letters<br />together. Even<br />    with<br />      the absence of a formal education, the huge need to constantly<br />decipher<br />      words can still make illiterate people a little more language<br />oriented<br />      nowadays.</p>
<p>    *Right! But remember, this is what we see today. But regarding the<br />ancient<br />    times, do we have any photos to see how things were? No, right? It is<br />    deciphered only based on certain historical evidences like, copper<br />plate,<br />    stone inscriptions, travellers accounts etc. Forget the copper<br />plates and<br />    stone inscriptions for the moment. Atleast certain travellers<br />accounts like<br />    Al-Beruni, Huen Tsang talk very highly about the literacy rates<br />prevalent<br />    then. *</p>
<p>    *And dont you think, the reason for present day illiteracy are only<br />    because of the politicians, who wants to maintain the status kuo<br />of the<br />    illiterates (pAmarans), to gain a mileage for their vote banks,<br />as, if those<br />    masses are really literate, all these politicians' cheat games will be<br />    exposed? *</p>
<p>    *This is a basic difference between the present day and ancient<br />day, when<br />    those rulers were really interested in the upliftment of their<br />subjects.<br />    Interestingly, I would say that the poor picture painted about the<br />toddy<br />    fetcher is only a perspective from a present day situation, as<br />that is what<br />    we see. Who knows, the ancient times toddy fetcher could have been<br />much well<br />    off. Remember that the story is deciphered only based on Two<br />Words, just<br />    Two Words that is "naakan URal". Irukkara kOttula nAma rOdu<br />pOtturukkOm....<br />    avvaLavudhAn.*</p>
<p>      Things must have been very different in the 3rd century AD.<br />Education<br />    was<br />      limited to certain classes, with gurukula being the primary form of<br />    formal<br />      education (am assuming this, please correct me if I am wrong),<br />and very<br />      little artificial signboards, the necessity to decipher letters<br />of any<br />    form<br />      would have been very minimal. So, with no formal education, most<br />of such<br />      people would have no need at all to encounter any form of<br />literature.<br />    Which<br />      is probably why education is given so much importance in our culture<br />    (naalu<br />      ezhuthhu padichavan). These people would probably not even feel the<br />    pinch of<br />      not knowing the alphabets, because the lifestyle would not have<br />required<br />      them to - This is my humble opinion.</p>
<p>    *I am asking this question, out of true ignorance. Except certain<br />works by<br />    the invading English, who did a lot of work to divide and rule the<br />people,<br />    are a there any inscriptions or copper plate or travellers account<br />which<br />    says that education was restricted to certain classes and<br />available only for<br />    certain elite classes? I am not challenging here, but I am only<br />questioning<br />    to understand better. And please do not bring documents like Manu<br />Smriti.<br />    Let us rely only on copper plates, stone inscriptions and traveller's<br />    account, as manu smriti is a much adulterated work, atleast the<br />copies that<br />    we have today.*</p>
<p>    *It is true that certain education was restricted to certain<br />classes, but<br />    that does not mean that those classes were really deprived of a basic<br />    education to read, write and account. I am pretty sure, atleast, I<br />have not<br />    come across any account which subscribes to this view. Please<br />correct me if<br />    I am wrong.<br />    *</p>
<p>      These are the reasons am skeptical about concluding that<br />toddy-gatherers<br />      would be educated - or that the society in general would be highly<br />    literate<br />      based on just this artifact. Probably Iravatham sir might have<br />seen more<br />      that might have led him to conclude so. This is not mentioned in the<br />      article.</p>
<p>    *I believe that Iravatham sir, had seen the other side of logical<br />    reasoning and that is why he might have concluded that the<br />literacy rates<br />    were so great in older days. Remember the words of Macaulay, doing<br />rounds in<br />    e-mail, in which he claims about the greatness of India and how<br />one need to<br />    divide us first, to plunder us later, in which they were indeed<br />successful.<br />    *</p>
<p>      Another possibility could be that there were two forms of<br />writing - one<br />      commonly and colloquially used among the masses, and another elite<br />    language.</p>
<p>    *Well. This is a certain possibility. I agree. That is what I<br />said, while<br />    certain education was restricted to certain classes, the basic<br />education was<br />    avaiable for everyone.*</p>
<p>    *I have only placed certain arguments based on my limited<br />understanding. I<br />    request our learned members to correct me wherever I am wrong. *</p>
<p>    *Regards,*</p>
<p>    *Venkatesh*</p>
<p>      We constantly see such occurings even today - tamil is the common<br />    language<br />      while english is (kinda) the elitist language in our society<br />today. I<br />    hear<br />      latin education was considered elitist and a compulsory subject<br />(even<br />    though<br />      it did not have any practical usage) till sometime last century<br />in many<br />      universities - english then being the common language in UK/US.</p>
<p>      Could it be that tamilbramhi was the commoners language which<br />was widely<br />      prevalent - which required little or no formal education, while<br />there<br />    was<br />      another form of elitist tamil/other languages/script?</p>

<p>        It makes sense to believe that the potter scribed the pot.</p>
<p>        Either way, the potter's ability to scribe and Naakan's ability to<br />    read in<br />        a remote 2000 year old village is astonishing. It just<br />emphasises the<br />    kind<br />        of governace and education system our ancestors had.</p>
<p>        There are other even much old scribing - for example the Sulur<br />( near<br />        Coimbatore ) plate in London Museum bearing late Indus script<br />and the<br />        Sembiankandiyur stone axe with the same Indus script are<br />acknowledged<br />    by<br />        scholars. There are thousands of pot shreds unearthed with<br />graffitti<br />    and<br />        Indus / Brahmi letters.</p>
<p>        So the literacy tradition in India was too ancient. We need not be<br />        surprised even if Naakan ( or was he Nakkan ? ) himself<br />scribed the<br />    pot!</p>

<p>          The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>          Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>
<p>          ??" Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology</p>
<p>          The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>          Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about<br />eighteen<br />          hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud<br />owner was a<br />          toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the<br />edge of<br />          the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of<br />Tamil<br />          Nadu).</p>
<p>          Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by<br />taking<br />          on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the<br />          toddy.</p>
<p>          There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would<br />climb the<br />          trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of<br />the trees<br />          with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to<br />collect<br />          the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>          The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a<br />few days<br />          to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a<br />          good market.</p>
<p>          Etched belongings</p>
<p>          Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to<br />          identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this<br />message on<br />          it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>          naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>          The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly<br />tapped<br />          toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />          oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>          Determining age</p>
<p>          Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a<br />couple<br />          of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of<br />my body,<br />          that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists<br />(who<br />          study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my<br />shoulder<br />          as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same<br />          period.</p>
<p>          And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an<br />important<br />          message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the<br />          ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a<br />remote<br />          hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could<br />write down<br />          his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>          That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />          discarded like other broken pottery!</p>
<p>          Iravatham Mahadevan is a well-known researcher of the Indus and<br />          Brahmi scripts. Dr. S. Rajagopal is a senior archaeologist<br />          specialising in Old Tamil inscriptions, who retired from the<br />Tamil<br />          Nadu State Department of Archaeology.</p>

<p>    The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>    Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>
<p>    — Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology</p>
<p>    The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>    Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about <br />eighteen<br />    hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud owner <br />was a<br />    toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the edge <br />of<br />    the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of Tamil<br />    Nadu).</p>
<p>    Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by <br />taking<br />    on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the<br />    toddy.</p>
<p>    There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would climb <br />the<br />    trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of the <br />trees<br />    with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to collect<br />    the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>    The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a few days<br />    to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a<br />    good market.</p>
<p>    Etched belongings</p>
<p>    Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to<br />    identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this message <br />on<br />    it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>    naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>    The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly tapped<br />    toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />    oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>    Determining age</p>
<p>    Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a couple<br />    of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of my <br />body,<br />    that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists (who<br />    study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my shoulder<br />    as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same<br />    period.</p>
<p>    And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an important<br />    message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the<br />    ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a remote<br />    hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could write <br />down<br />    his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>    That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />    discarded like other broken pottery!</p>
<p>    Iravatham Mahadevan is a well-known researcher of the Indus and<br />    Brahmi scripts. Dr. S. Rajagopal is a senior archaeologist<br />    specialising in Old Tamil inscriptions, who retired from the Tamil<br />    Nadu State Department of Archaeology.</p></blockquote>

<p>      For example, consider this:<br />      In current times, with so many boards and hoardings (that <br />display<br />    alphabets<br />      basically), with a widespread and highly available education <br />system, we<br />      still come across people who cannot even string letters <br />together. Even<br />    with<br />      the absence of a formal education, the huge need to constantly <br />decipher<br />      words can still make illiterate people a little more language <br />oriented<br />      nowadays.</p>
<p>    *Right! But remember, this is what we see today. But regarding <br />the ancient<br />    times, do we have any photos to see how things were? No, right? <br />It is<br />    deciphered only based on certain historical evidences like, <br />copper plate,<br />    stone inscriptions, travellers accounts etc. Forget the copper <br />plates and<br />    stone inscriptions for the moment. Atleast certain travellers <br />accounts like<br />    Al-Beruni, Huen Tsang talk very highly about the literacy rates <br />prevalent<br />    then. *</p>
<p>    *And dont you think, the reason for present day illiteracy are <br />only<br />    because of the politicians, who wants to maintain the status kuo <br />of the<br />    illiterates (pAmarans), to gain a mileage for their vote banks, <br />as, if those<br />    masses are really literate, all these politicians' cheat games <br />will be<br />    exposed? *</p>
<p>    *This is a basic difference between the present day and ancient <br />day, when<br />    those rulers were really interested in the upliftment of their <br />subjects.<br />    Interestingly, I would say that the poor picture painted about <br />the toddy<br />    fetcher is only a perspective from a present day situation, as <br />that is what<br />    we see. Who knows, the ancient times toddy fetcher could have <br />been much well<br />    off. Remember that the story is deciphered only based on Two <br />Words, just<br />    Two Words that is "naakan URal". Irukkara kOttula nAma rOdu <br />pOtturukkOm....<br />    avvaLavudhAn.*</p>
<p>      Things must have been very different in the 3rd century AD. <br />Education<br />    was<br />      limited to certain classes, with gurukula being the primary <br />form of<br />    formal<br />      education (am assuming this, please correct me if I am wrong), <br />and very<br />      little artificial signboards, the necessity to decipher letters <br />of any<br />    form<br />      would have been very minimal. So, with no formal education, <br />most of such<br />      people would have no need at all to encounter any form of <br />literature.<br />    Which<br />      is probably why education is given so much importance in our <br />culture<br />    (naalu<br />      ezhuthhu padichavan). These people would probably not even feel <br />the<br />    pinch of<br />      not knowing the alphabets, because the lifestyle would not have <br />required<br />      them to - This is my humble opinion.</p>
<p>    *I am asking this question, out of true ignorance. Except certain <br />works by<br />    the invading English, who did a lot of work to divide and rule <br />the people,<br />    are a there any inscriptions or copper plate or travellers <br />account which<br />    says that education was restricted to certain classes and <br />available only for<br />    certain elite classes? I am not challenging here, but I am only <br />questioning<br />    to understand better. And please do not bring documents like <br />Manu Smriti.<br />    Let us rely only on copper plates, stone inscriptions and <br />traveller's<br />    account, as manu smriti is a much adulterated work, atleast the <br />copies that<br />    we have today.*</p>
<p>    *It is true that certain education was restricted to certain <br />classes, but<br />    that does not mean that those classes were really deprived of a <br />basic<br />    education to read, write and account. I am pretty sure, atleast, <br />I have not<br />    come across any account which subscribes to this view. Please <br />correct me if<br />    I am wrong.<br />    *</p>
<p>      These are the reasons am skeptical about concluding that toddy-<br />gatherers<br />      would be educated - or that the society in general would be <br />highly<br />    literate<br />      based on just this artifact. Probably Iravatham sir might have <br />seen more<br />      that might have led him to conclude so. This is not mentioned <br />in the<br />      article.</p>
<p>    *I believe that Iravatham sir, had seen the other side of logical<br />    reasoning and that is why he might have concluded that the <br />literacy rates<br />    were so great in older days. Remember the words of Macaulay, <br />doing rounds in<br />    e-mail, in which he claims about the greatness of India and how <br />one need to<br />    divide us first, to plunder us later, in which they were indeed <br />successful.<br />    *</p>
<p>      Another possibility could be that there were two forms of <br />writing - one<br />      commonly and colloquially used among the masses, and another <br />elite<br />    language.</p>
<p>    *Well. This is a certain possibility. I agree. That is what I <br />said, while<br />    certain education was restricted to certain classes, the basic <br />education was<br />    avaiable for everyone.*</p>
<p>    *I have only placed certain arguments based on my limited <br />understanding. I<br />    request our learned members to correct me wherever I am wrong. *</p>
<p>    *Regards,*</p>
<p>    *Venkatesh*</p>
<p>      We constantly see such occurings even today - tamil is the <br />common<br />    language<br />      while english is (kinda) the elitist language in our society <br />today. I<br />    hear<br />      latin education was considered elitist and a compulsory subject <br />(even<br />    though<br />      it did not have any practical usage) till sometime last century <br />in many<br />      universities - english then being the common language in UK/US.</p>
<p>      Could it be that tamilbramhi was the commoners language which <br />was widely<br />      prevalent - which required little or no formal education, while <br />there<br />    was<br />      another form of elitist tamil/other languages/script?</p>

<p>          The tale of a broken pot</p>

<p>          The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>          Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about <br />eighteen<br />          hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud <br />owner was a<br />          toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at <br />the edge of<br />          the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of <br />Tamil<br />          Nadu).</p>
<p>          Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living <br />by taking<br />          on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and <br />selling the<br />          toddy.</p>
<p>          There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would <br />climb the<br />          trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of <br />the trees<br />          with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to <br />collect<br />          the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>          The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a <br />few days<br />          to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there <br />was a<br />          good market.</p>
<p>          Etched belongings</p>
<p>          Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order <br />to<br />          identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this <br />message on<br />          it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>          naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>          The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly <br />tapped<br />          toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />          oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>          Determining age</p>
<p>          Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a <br />couple<br />          of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of <br />my body,<br />          that I was made in about the third century A.D. <br />Epigraphists (who<br />          study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my <br />shoulder<br />          as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the <br />same<br />          period.</p>
<p>          And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an <br />important<br />          message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in <br />the<br />          ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a <br />remote<br />          hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could <br />write down<br />          his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>          That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />          discarded like other broken pottery!</p>

          how literate can a toddy gather be in ancient india        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Sorry, I missed this. Regarding the literacy prevalent then, I would<br />still like to stick my point that basic education was available for a<br />larger section, while certain eductation were restricted for certain<br />classes, as there are no accounts (unless I am corrected) indicating<br />that the kings did not allow basic education to the people in the lower<br />rungs of the society. Also on a logical reasoning, a country can be<br />prosperous only if the literacy is high. Looking a the glory of India in<br />older days, which invited all the foreigners to invade us, I have to<br />conclude that the literacy was, if not so great, definitely better than<br />what we see today.</p>

<p>      For example, consider this:<br />      In current times, with so many boards and hoardings (that display<br />    alphabets<br />      basically), with a widespread and highly available education<br />system, we<br />      still come across people who cannot even string letters together.<br />Even<br />    with<br />      the absence of a formal education, the huge need to constantly<br />decipher<br />      words can still make illiterate people a little more language<br />oriented<br />      nowadays.</p>
<p>    *Right! But remember, this is what we see today. But regarding the<br />ancient<br />    times, do we have any photos to see how things were? No, right? It<br />is<br />    deciphered only based on certain historical evidences like, copper<br />plate,<br />    stone inscriptions, travellers accounts etc. Forget the copper<br />plates and<br />    stone inscriptions for the moment. Atleast certain travellers<br />accounts like<br />    Al-Beruni, Huen Tsang talk very highly about the literacy rates<br />prevalent<br />    then. *</p>
<p>    *And dont you think, the reason for present day illiteracy are only<br />    because of the politicians, who wants to maintain the status kuo of<br />the<br />    illiterates (pAmarans), to gain a mileage for their vote banks, as,<br />if those<br />    masses are really literate, all these politicians' cheat games will<br />be<br />    exposed? *</p>
<p>    *This is a basic difference between the present day and ancient day,<br />when<br />    those rulers were really interested in the upliftment of their<br />subjects.<br />    Interestingly, I would say that the poor picture painted about the<br />toddy<br />    fetcher is only a perspective from a present day situation, as that<br />is what<br />    we see. Who knows, the ancient times toddy fetcher could have been<br />much well<br />    off. Remember that the story is deciphered only based on Two Words,<br />just<br />    Two Words that is "naakan URal". Irukkara kOttula nAma rOdu<br />pOtturukkOm....<br />    avvaLavudhAn.*</p>
<p>      Things must have been very different in the 3rd century AD.<br />Education<br />    was<br />      limited to certain classes, with gurukula being the primary form<br />of<br />    formal<br />      education (am assuming this, please correct me if I am wrong), and<br />very<br />      little artificial signboards, the necessity to decipher letters of<br />any<br />    form<br />      would have been very minimal. So, with no formal education, most<br />of such<br />      people would have no need at all to encounter any form of<br />literature.<br />    Which<br />      is probably why education is given so much importance in our<br />culture<br />    (naalu<br />      ezhuthhu padichavan). These people would probably not even feel<br />the<br />    pinch of<br />      not knowing the alphabets, because the lifestyle would not have<br />required<br />      them to - This is my humble opinion.</p>
<p>    *I am asking this question, out of true ignorance. Except certain<br />works by<br />    the invading English, who did a lot of work to divide and rule the<br />people,<br />    are a there any inscriptions or copper plate or travellers account<br />which<br />    says that education was restricted to certain classes and available<br />only for<br />    certain elite classes? I am not challenging here, but I am only<br />questioning<br />    to understand better. And please do not bring documents like Manu<br />Smriti.<br />    Let us rely only on copper plates, stone inscriptions and<br />traveller's<br />    account, as manu smriti is a much adulterated work, atleast the<br />copies that<br />    we have today.*</p>
<p>    *It is true that certain education was restricted to certain<br />classes, but<br />    that does not mean that those classes were really deprived of a<br />basic<br />    education to read, write and account. I am pretty sure, atleast, I<br />have not<br />    come across any account which subscribes to this view. Please<br />correct me if<br />    I am wrong.<br />    *</p>
<p>      These are the reasons am skeptical about concluding that<br />toddy-gatherers<br />      would be educated - or that the society in general would be highly<br />    literate<br />      based on just this artifact. Probably Iravatham sir might have<br />seen more<br />      that might have led him to conclude so. This is not mentioned in<br />the<br />      article.</p>
<p>    *I believe that Iravatham sir, had seen the other side of logical<br />    reasoning and that is why he might have concluded that the literacy<br />rates<br />    were so great in older days. Remember the words of Macaulay, doing<br />rounds in<br />    e-mail, in which he claims about the greatness of India and how one<br />need to<br />    divide us first, to plunder us later, in which they were indeed<br />successful.<br />    *</p>
<p>      Another possibility could be that there were two forms of writing<br />- one<br />      commonly and colloquially used among the masses, and another elite<br />    language.</p>
<p>    *Well. This is a certain possibility. I agree. That is what I said,<br />while<br />    certain education was restricted to certain classes, the basic<br />education was<br />    avaiable for everyone.*</p>
<p>    *I have only placed certain arguments based on my limited<br />understanding. I<br />    request our learned members to correct me wherever I am wrong. *</p>
<p>    *Regards,*</p>
<p>    *Venkatesh*</p>
<p>      We constantly see such occurings even today - tamil is the common<br />    language<br />      while english is (kinda) the elitist language in our society<br />today. I<br />    hear<br />      latin education was considered elitist and a compulsory subject<br />(even<br />    though<br />      it did not have any practical usage) till sometime last century in<br />many<br />      universities - english then being the common language in UK/US.</p>
<p>      Could it be that tamilbramhi was the commoners language which was<br />widely<br />      prevalent - which required little or no formal education, while<br />there<br />    was<br />      another form of elitist tamil/other languages/script?</p>

          how literate can a toddy gather be in ancient india        </div>

        <p>Dear Raghavendra</p>
<p>That is a good and possible perspective. Now I am really curious as <br />to how Iravatham,deciphered the story on the basis of these two <br />words. What were the other pointers that made him conclude so. </p>

<p>      For example, consider this:<br />      In current times, with so many boards and hoardings (that <br />display<br />    alphabets<br />      basically), with a widespread and highly available education <br />system, we<br />      still come across people who cannot even string letters <br />together. Even<br />    with<br />      the absence of a formal education, the huge need to constantly <br />decipher<br />      words can still make illiterate people a little more language <br />oriented<br />      nowadays.</p>
<p>    *Right! But remember, this is what we see today. But regarding <br />the ancient<br />    times, do we have any photos to see how things were? No, right? <br />It is<br />    deciphered only based on certain historical evidences like, <br />copper plate,<br />    stone inscriptions, travellers accounts etc. Forget the copper <br />plates and<br />    stone inscriptions for the moment. Atleast certain travellers <br />accounts like<br />    Al-Beruni, Huen Tsang talk very highly about the literacy rates <br />prevalent<br />    then. *</p>
<p>    *And dont you think, the reason for present day illiteracy are <br />only<br />    because of the politicians, who wants to maintain the status kuo <br />of the<br />    illiterates (pAmarans), to gain a mileage for their vote banks, <br />as, if those<br />    masses are really literate, all these politicians' cheat games <br />will be<br />    exposed? *</p>
<p>    *This is a basic difference between the present day and ancient <br />day, when<br />    those rulers were really interested in the upliftment of their <br />subjects.<br />    Interestingly, I would say that the poor picture painted about <br />the toddy<br />    fetcher is only a perspective from a present day situation, as <br />that is what<br />    we see. Who knows, the ancient times toddy fetcher could have <br />been much well<br />    off. Remember that the story is deciphered only based on Two <br />Words, just<br />    Two Words that is "naakan URal". Irukkara kOttula nAma rOdu <br />pOtturukkOm....<br />    avvaLavudhAn.*</p>
<p>      Things must have been very different in the 3rd century AD. <br />Education<br />    was<br />      limited to certain classes, with gurukula being the primary <br />form of<br />    formal<br />      education (am assuming this, please correct me if I am wrong), <br />and very<br />      little artificial signboards, the necessity to decipher <br />letters of any<br />    form<br />      would have been very minimal. So, with no formal education, <br />most of such<br />      people would have no need at all to encounter any form of <br />literature.<br />    Which<br />      is probably why education is given so much importance in our <br />culture<br />    (naalu<br />      ezhuthhu padichavan). These people would probably not even <br />feel the<br />    pinch of<br />      not knowing the alphabets, because the lifestyle would not <br />have required<br />      them to - This is my humble opinion.</p>
<p>    *I am asking this question, out of true ignorance. Except <br />certain works by<br />    the invading English, who did a lot of work to divide and rule <br />the people,<br />    are a there any inscriptions or copper plate or travellers <br />account which<br />    says that education was restricted to certain classes and <br />available only for<br />    certain elite classes? I am not challenging here, but I am only <br />questioning<br />    to understand better. And please do not bring documents like <br />Manu Smriti.<br />    Let us rely only on copper plates, stone inscriptions and <br />traveller's<br />    account, as manu smriti is a much adulterated work, atleast the <br />copies that<br />    we have today.*</p>
<p>    *It is true that certain education was restricted to certain <br />classes, but<br />    that does not mean that those classes were really deprived of a <br />basic<br />    education to read, write and account. I am pretty sure, atleast, <br />I have not<br />    come across any account which subscribes to this view. Please <br />correct me if<br />    I am wrong.<br />    *</p>
<p>      These are the reasons am skeptical about concluding that toddy-<br />gatherers<br />      would be educated - or that the society in general would be <br />highly<br />    literate<br />      based on just this artifact. Probably Iravatham sir might have <br />seen more<br />      that might have led him to conclude so. This is not mentioned <br />in the<br />      article.</p>
<p>    *I believe that Iravatham sir, had seen the other side of logical<br />    reasoning and that is why he might have concluded that the <br />literacy rates<br />    were so great in older days. Remember the words of Macaulay, <br />doing rounds in<br />    e-mail, in which he claims about the greatness of India and how <br />one need to<br />    divide us first, to plunder us later, in which they were indeed <br />successful.<br />    *</p>
<p>      Another possibility could be that there were two forms of <br />writing - one<br />      commonly and colloquially used among the masses, and another <br />elite<br />    language.</p>
<p>    *Well. This is a certain possibility. I agree. That is what I <br />said, while<br />    certain education was restricted to certain classes, the basic <br />education was<br />    avaiable for everyone.*</p>
<p>    *I have only placed certain arguments based on my limited <br />understanding. I<br />    request our learned members to correct me wherever I am wrong. *</p>
<p>    *Regards,*</p>
<p>    *Venkatesh*</p>
<p>      We constantly see such occurings even today - tamil is the <br />common<br />    language<br />      while english is (kinda) the elitist language in our society <br />today. I<br />    hear<br />      latin education was considered elitist and a compulsory <br />subject (even<br />    though<br />      it did not have any practical usage) till sometime last <br />century in many<br />      universities - english then being the common language in UK/US.</p>
<p>      Could it be that tamilbramhi was the commoners language which <br />was widely<br />      prevalent - which required little or no formal education, <br />while there<br />    was<br />      another form of elitist tamil/other languages/script?</p>

<p>        Hi Madan,</p>
<p>        If you have your name engraved in German in your iPod, <br />probably you<br />        atleast know how to read it!</p>
<p>        It makes sense to believe that the potter scribed the pot.</p>
<p>        Either way, the potter's ability to scribe and Naakan's <br />ability to<br />    read in<br />        a remote 2000 year old village is astonishing. It just <br />emphasises the<br />    kind<br />        of governace and education system our ancestors had.</p>
<p>        There are other even much old scribing - for example the <br />Sulur ( near<br />        Coimbatore ) plate in London Museum bearing late Indus <br />script and the<br />        Sembiankandiyur stone axe with the same Indus script are <br />acknowledged<br />    by<br />        scholars. There are thousands of pot shreds unearthed with <br />graffitti<br />    and<br />        Indus / Brahmi letters.</p>
<p>        So the literacy tradition in India was too ancient. We need <br />not be<br />        surprised even if Naakan ( or was he Nakkan ? ) himself <br />scribed the<br />    pot!</p>

<p>        sorry to be so cynical, but if I get an engraved iPod, with <br />words in<br />        german, does it mean that I can write german?</p>

<p>          The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>          Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>
<p>          ??" Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of <br />Archaeology</p>
<p>          The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>          Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, <br />about eighteen<br />          hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud <br />owner was a<br />          toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at <br />the edge of<br />          the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district <br />of Tamil<br />          Nadu).</p>
<p>          Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living <br />by taking<br />          on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and <br />selling the<br />          toddy.</p>
<p>          There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would <br />climb the<br />          trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of <br />the trees<br />          with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to <br />collect<br />          the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>          The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a <br />few days<br />          to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there <br />was a<br />          good market.</p>
<p>          Etched belongings</p>
<p>          Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order <br />to<br />          identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this <br />message on<br />          it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>          naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>          The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning <br />`freshly tapped<br />          toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />          oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>          Determining age</p>
<p>          Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti <br />a couple<br />          of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of <br />my body,<br />          that I was made in about the third century A.D. <br />Epigraphists (who<br />          study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my <br />shoulder<br />          as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the <br />same<br />          period.</p>
<p>          And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an <br />important<br />          message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in <br />the<br />          ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a <br />remote<br />          hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could <br />write down<br />          his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>          That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />          discarded like other broken pottery!</p>

<p>    For example, consider this:<br />    In current times, with so many boards and hoardings (that display<br />  alphabets<br />    basically), with a widespread and highly available education system, we<br />    still come across people who cannot even string letters together. Even<br />  with<br />    the absence of a formal education, the huge need to constantly decipher<br />    words can still make illiterate people a little more language oriented<br />    nowadays.</p>
<p>  *Right! But remember, this is what we see today. But regarding the ancient<br />  times, do we have any photos to see how things were? No, right? It is<br />  deciphered only based on certain historical evidences like, copper plate,<br />  stone inscriptions, travellers accounts etc. Forget the copper plates and<br />  stone inscriptions for the moment. Atleast certain travellers accounts like<br />  Al-Beruni, Huen Tsang talk very highly about the literacy rates prevalent<br />  then. *</p>
<p>  *And dont you think, the reason for present day illiteracy are only<br />  because of the politicians, who wants to maintain the status kuo of the<br />  illiterates (pAmarans), to gain a mileage for their vote banks, as, if those<br />  masses are really literate, all these politicians' cheat games will be<br />  exposed? *</p>
<p>  *This is a basic difference between the present day and ancient day, when<br />  those rulers were really interested in the upliftment of their subjects.<br />  Interestingly, I would say that the poor picture painted about the toddy<br />  fetcher is only a perspective from a present day situation, as that is what<br />  we see. Who knows, the ancient times toddy fetcher could have been much well<br />  off.  Remember that the story is deciphered only based on Two Words, just<br />  Two Words that is "naakan URal". Irukkara kOttula nAma rOdu pOtturukkOm....<br />  avvaLavudhAn.*</p>
<p>    Things must have been very different in the 3rd century AD. Education<br />  was<br />    limited to certain classes, with gurukula being the primary form of<br />  formal<br />    education (am assuming this, please correct me if I am wrong), and very<br />    little artificial signboards, the necessity to decipher letters of any<br />  form<br />    would have been very minimal. So, with no formal education, most of such<br />    people would have no need at all to encounter any form of literature.<br />  Which<br />    is probably why education is given so much importance in our culture<br />  (naalu<br />    ezhuthhu padichavan). These people would probably not even feel the<br />  pinch of<br />    not knowing the alphabets, because the lifestyle would not have required<br />    them to - This is my humble opinion.</p>
<p>  *I am asking this question, out of true ignorance. Except certain works by<br />  the invading English, who did a lot of work to divide and rule the people,<br />  are a there any inscriptions or copper plate or travellers account which<br />  says that education was restricted to certain classes and available only for<br />  certain elite classes? I am not challenging here, but I am only questioning<br />  to understand better.  And please do not bring documents like Manu Smriti.<br />  Let us rely only on copper plates, stone inscriptions and traveller's<br />  account, as manu smriti is a much adulterated work, atleast the copies that<br />  we have today.*</p>
<p>  *It is true that certain education was restricted to certain classes, but<br />  that does not mean that those classes were really deprived of a basic<br />  education to read, write and account. I am pretty sure, atleast, I have not<br />  come across any account which subscribes to this view. Please correct me if<br />  I am wrong.<br />  *</p>
<p>    These are the reasons am skeptical about concluding that toddy-gatherers<br />    would be educated - or that the society in general would be highly<br />  literate<br />    based on just this artifact. Probably Iravatham sir might have seen more<br />    that might have led him to conclude so. This is not mentioned in the<br />    article.</p>
<p>  *I believe that Iravatham sir, had seen the other side of logical<br />  reasoning and that is why he might have concluded that the literacy rates<br />  were so great in older days. Remember the words of Macaulay, doing rounds in<br />  e-mail, in which he claims about the greatness of India and how one need to<br />  divide us first, to plunder us later, in which they were indeed successful.<br />  *</p>
<p>    Another possibility could be that there were two forms of writing - one<br />    commonly and colloquially used among the masses, and another elite<br />  language.</p>
<p>  *Well. This is a certain possibility. I agree. That is what I said, while<br />  certain education was restricted to certain classes, the basic education was<br />  avaiable for everyone.*</p>
<p>  *I have only placed certain arguments based on my limited understanding. I<br />  request our learned members to correct me wherever I am wrong. *</p>
<p>  *Regards,*</p>
<p>  *Venkatesh*</p>
<p>    We constantly see such occurings even today - tamil is the common<br />  language<br />    while english is (kinda) the elitist language in our society today. I<br />  hear<br />    latin education was considered elitist and a compulsory subject (even<br />  though<br />    it did not have any practical usage) till sometime last century in many<br />    universities - english then being the common language in UK/US.</p>
<p>    Could it be that tamilbramhi was the commoners language which was widely<br />    prevalent - which required little or no formal education, while there<br />  was<br />    another form of elitist tamil/other languages/script?</p>

<p>      Either way, the potter's ability to scribe and Naakan's ability to<br />  read in<br />      a remote 2000 year old village is astonishing. It just emphasises the<br />  kind<br />      of governace and education system our ancestors had.</p>
<p>      There are other even much old scribing - for example the Sulur ( near<br />      Coimbatore ) plate in London Museum bearing late Indus script and the<br />      Sembiankandiyur stone axe with the same Indus script are acknowledged<br />  by<br />      scholars. There are thousands of pot shreds unearthed with graffitti<br />  and<br />      Indus / Brahmi letters.</p>
<p>      So the literacy tradition in India was too ancient. We need not be<br />      surprised even if Naakan ( or was he Nakkan ? ) himself scribed the<br />  pot!</p>

<p>        The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>        Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>

<p>        The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>        Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about eighteen<br />        hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud owner was a<br />        toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the edge of<br />        the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of Tamil<br />        Nadu).</p>
<p>        Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by taking<br />        on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the<br />        toddy.</p>
<p>        There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would climb the<br />        trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of the trees<br />        with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to collect<br />        the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>        The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a few days<br />        to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a<br />        good market.</p>
<p>        Etched belongings</p>
<p>        Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to<br />        identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this message on<br />        it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>        naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>        The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly tapped<br />        toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />        oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>        Determining age</p>
<p>        Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a couple<br />        of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of my body,<br />        that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists (who<br />        study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my shoulder<br />        as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same<br />        period.</p>
<p>        And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an important<br />        message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the<br />        ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a remote<br />        hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could write down<br />        his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>        That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />        discarded like other broken pottery!</p>
<p>        Iravatham Mahadevan is a well-known researcher of the Indus and<br />        Brahmi scripts. Dr. S. Rajagopal is a senior archaeologist<br />        specialising in Old Tamil inscriptions, who retired from the Tamil<br />        Nadu State Department of Archaeology.</p></blockquote>

My proud owner was<br />a<br />      toddy-tapper named Naakan.

<p>      naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>      The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly tapped<br />      toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />      oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>

          how literate can a toddy gather be in ancient india        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I agree that toddy gatherers among themselves should be able to read, which<br />the reason it was scribed...</p>
<p>I would really be proud if education was very prevalent in ancient times in<br />tamilnadu.</p>
<p>Having said those, I still feel that this cannot substansiate the fact that<br />literacy rate was high in those times.</p>
<p>For example, consider this:<br />In current times, with so many boards and hoardings (that display alphabets<br />basically), with a widespread and highly available education system, we<br />still come across people who cannot even string letters together. Even with<br />the absence of a formal education, the huge need to constantly decipher<br />words can still make illiterate people a little more language oriented<br />nowadays.</p>
<p>Things must have been very different in the 3rd century AD. Education was<br />limited to certain classes, with gurukula being the primary form of formal<br />education (am assuming this, please correct me if I am wrong), and very<br />little artificial signboards, the necessity to decipher letters of any form<br />would have been very minimal. So, with no formal education, most of such<br />people would have no need at all to encounter any form of literature. Which<br />is probably why education is given so much importance in our culture (naalu<br />ezhuthhu padichavan). These people would probably not even feel the pinch of<br />not knowing the alphabets, because the lifestyle would not have required<br />them to - This is my humble opinion.</p>
<p>These are the reasons am skeptical about concluding that toddy-gatherers<br />would be educated - or that the society in general would be highly literate<br />based on just this artifact. Probably Iravatham sir might have seen more<br />that might have led him to conclude so. This is not mentioned in the<br />article.</p>
<p>Another possibility could be that there were two forms of writing - one<br />commonly and colloquially used among the masses, and another elite language.</p>
<p>We constantly see such occurings even today - tamil is the common language<br />while english is (kinda) the elitist language in our society today. I hear<br />latin education was considered elitist and a compulsory subject (even though<br />it did not have any practical usage) till sometime last century in many<br />universities - english then being the common language in UK/US.</p>
<p>Could it be that tamilbramhi was the commoners language which was widely<br />prevalent - which required little or no formal education, while there was<br />another form of elitist tamil/other languages/script?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>

<p>  If you have your name engraved in German in your iPod, probably you<br />  atleast know how to read it!</p>
<p>  It makes sense to believe that the potter scribed the pot.</p>
<p>  Either way, the potter's ability to scribe and Naakan's ability to read in<br />  a remote 2000 year old village is astonishing. It just emphasises the kind<br />  of governace and education system our ancestors had.</p>
<p>  There are other even much old scribing - for example the Sulur ( near<br />  Coimbatore ) plate in London Museum bearing late Indus script and the<br />  Sembiankandiyur stone axe with the same Indus script are acknowledged by<br />  scholars.

<p>  So the literacy tradition in India was too ancient. We need not be<br />  surprised even if Naakan ( or was he Nakkan ? ) himself scribed the pot!</p>

<p>    The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>    Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>
<p>    ? Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology</p>
<p>    The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>    Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about eighteen<br />    hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud owner was a<br />    toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the edge of<br />    the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of Tamil<br />    Nadu).</p>
<p>    Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by taking<br />    on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the<br />    toddy.</p>
<p>    There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would climb the<br />    trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of the trees<br />    with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to collect<br />    the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>    The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a few days<br />    to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a<br />    good market.</p>
<p>    Etched belongings</p>
<p>    Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to<br />    identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this message on<br />    it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>    naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>    The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly tapped<br />    toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />    oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>    Determining age</p>
<p>    Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a couple<br />    of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of my body,<br />    that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists (who<br />    study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my shoulder<br />    as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same<br />    period.</p>
<p>    And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an important<br />    message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the<br />    ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a remote<br />    hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could write down<br />    his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>    That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />    discarded like other broken pottery!</p>

        <p>Unfortunately we cant determine that...all the eedu shelf life is 200<br />yrs max...so every script we have present day was copy of the old palm<br />script by some person ...except for few palm leaves stored in Tibet<br />while bhuddist from Tn went to Tibet.<br />Palm leaves get destroyed due to our climate...and majorly due to<br />white ants or termites....<br />other things are flood....and ppl also had practice of putting old edu<br />in river as part of festival or ritual....<br />so we have lost so many palm leaves for so many diff reasons....<br />so what ever palm leaves we have was probably written in 17 or 18th<br />century by some scholar who copied it from a older script....<br />so here comes the problem wether a work is of a single person....<br />there have been proofs where the person who copies writes his own<br />stuff and deletes the orginal stuff....<br />A French translator of Thirukural in 18th century had more than 1330<br />Thirukurals in Palm leaves..<br />There has also been an instant where editor mahabaratha was shivate<br />and hence removed orignal passage and inserted passages to praise<br />shiva when he copied the orginal text....<br />The problem of Dating with Tolkapiyam is that it has hands of many<br />people....<br />So in Tamil Nadu no plam leave is original...every thing is a copied<br />version...<br />If at all anything survived ...then it is in some European library</p>

<p>      The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>      Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>
<p>      ??" Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology</p>
<p>      The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum..</p>
<p>      Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about <br />  eighteen<br />      hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud owner <br />  was a<br />      toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the edge <br />  of<br />      the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of Tamil<br />      Nadu).</p>
<p>      Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by <br />  taking<br />      on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the<br />      toddy.</p>
<p>      There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would climb <br />  the<br />      trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of the <br />  trees<br />      with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to collect<br />      the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>      The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a few days<br />      to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a<br />      good market.</p>
<p>      Etched belongings</p>
<p>      Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to<br />      identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this message <br />  on<br />      it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>      naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>      The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly tapped<br />      toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />      oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>      Determining age</p>
<p>      Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a couple<br />      of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of my <br />  body,<br />      that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists (who<br />      study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my shoulder<br />      as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same<br />      period.</p>
<p>      And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an important<br />      message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the<br />      ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a remote<br />      hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could write <br />  down<br />      his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>      That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />      discarded like other broken pottery!</p>
<p>      Iravatham Mahadevan is a well-known researcher of the Indus and<br />      Brahmi scripts. Dr. S. Rajagopal is a senior archaeologist<br />      specialising in Old Tamil inscriptions, who retired from the Tamil<br />      Nadu State Department of Archaeology.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I always seem to convey wrong meaning... I think it is still common<br />to write ones name on vessels - somebody else does it for us. Am just saying<br />it could be possible - maybe - that somebody else, probably the potter<br />carved the name on the pot for naakan.</p>

<p>    The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>    Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>
<p>    ? Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology</p>
<p>    The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>    Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about <br />eighteen<br />    hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud owner <br />was a<br />    toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the edge <br />of<br />    the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of Tamil<br />    Nadu).</p>
<p>    Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by <br />taking<br />    on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the<br />    toddy.</p>
<p>    There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would climb <br />the<br />    trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of the <br />trees<br />    with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to collect<br />    the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>    The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a few days<br />    to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a<br />    good market.</p>
<p>    Etched belongings</p>
<p>    Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to<br />    identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this message <br />on<br />    it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>    naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>    The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly tapped<br />    toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />    oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>    Determining age</p>
<p>    Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a couple<br />    of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of my <br />body,<br />    that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists (who<br />    study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my shoulder<br />    as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same<br />    period.</p>
<p>    And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an important<br />    message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the<br />    ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a remote<br />    hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could write <br />down<br />    his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>

<p>  The tale of a broken pot</p>
<p>  Iravatham Mahadevan and S. Rajagopal</p>
<p>  ? Photo: Courtesy Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology</p>
<p>  The broken pot from Andipatti, stored in a museum.</p>
<p>  Today I am a broken pot stored away in a museum. But, about eighteen<br />  hundred years ago, I was a shining new kalayam. My proud owner was a<br />  toddy-tapper named Naakan. He lived in a small hamlet at the edge of<br />  the forest (near present-day Andipatti in Theni district of Tamil<br />  Nadu).</p>
<p>  Naakan was too poor to own land; but he earned his living by taking<br />  on lease some coconut and palmyra trees, tapping and selling the<br />  toddy.</p>
<p>  There were several toddy-tappers in the hamlet. They would climb the<br />  trees early in the morning, make deep cuts on the crown of the trees<br />  with their sharp bill-hooks, and tie their pots beneath to collect<br />  the sap (juice) that oozed from the cuttings.</p>
<p>  The pots, when full, would be taken down and stored for a few days<br />  to allow fermenting of the sap into toddy, for which there was a<br />  good market.</p>
<p>  Etched belongings</p>
<p>  Poor he might have been, but Naakan was literate. In order to<br />  identify his kalayam and its contents, he scratched this message on<br />  it with his sharp iron tool:</p>
<p>  naakan uRal `Naakan's (pot with) toddy-sap'</p>
<p>  The Tamil word ooRal (from ooRu `to ooze') meaning `freshly tapped<br />  toddy' is spelt here with the short vowel u probably due to<br />  oversight or reflecting the colloquial usage.</p>
<p>  Determining age</p>
<p>  Archaeologists who dug me out of the earth near Andipatti a couple<br />  of years ago, have determined from examining the fabric of my body,<br />  that I was made in about the third century A.D. Epigraphists (who<br />  study old inscriptions) have identified the writing on my shoulder<br />  as in Old Tamil written in the Tamil-Brahmi script of the same<br />  period.</p>
<p>  And that is not all. The two-word inscription carries an important<br />  message, namely, how widespread literacy must have been in the<br />  ancient Tamil country, if a poor toddy-tapper, living in a remote<br />  hamlet far away from urban and commercial centres, could write down<br />  his name and what he was doing with the pottery he owned.</p>
<p>  That is the reason why I am preserved in the museum and not<br />  discarded like other broken pottery!</p>
<p>  Iravatham Mahadevan is a well-known researcher of the Indus and<br />  Brahmi scripts. Dr. S. Rajagopal is a senior archaeologist<br />  specialising in Old Tamil inscriptions, who retired from the Tamil<br />  Nadu State Department of Archaeology.</p>
