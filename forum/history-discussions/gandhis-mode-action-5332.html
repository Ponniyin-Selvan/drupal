<p>Hi muruganandam.<br />a wonderful analysis of gandhi's action. gandhi's methods were new <br />and being tested in the field for the first time. even congress men <br />did not trust their efficacy all the time.</p>
<p>yes gandhi alaway acted in one mass movement once a decade.<br />it was to gather strenght and push the british out in one go. he <br />failed twice.</p>
<p>infact i read a very good book on the political impact of the salt <br />march.<br />the writer accuses the salt march of being a failure for gandhi had <br />to go to the vice regal house and plead for the release of millions <br />arrested.<br />also he says politically the energy spent on the salt march put the <br />entire freedm movement on hold for 10 extra years.</p>
<p>with world war two gandhi realised it was time for a final trust.</p>
<p>gandhi always played on the concience of the britishman. when the <br />british told their own people that the fight against nazis was for <br />freedom the same principles applied to the indian scenario too.</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If Gandhi and Nehru had not insisted much, India would<br />have been a HINDU country (like Pak becoming muslim<br />country)instead of being secular as now which have<br />lead to minority appeasement for vote banks even after<br />60 years of independence.</p>
<p>No wonder conversion of hindus to muslim had been<br />rampant in Pak since independence whereas vice versa<br />do not happen in india. </p>
<p>Bye<br />M.A.Eswaran</p>
<blockquote><p> Personally, i feel, gandhi as a politician had done<br /> lot of long<br /> lasting harm to our psychos and nation.. HIs double<br />standards in<br /> terms of hindu muslim riots is still, a blot in our<br /> history..</p></blockquote>

<p>Hi venu </p>
<p>i think its just not worth the time to to read your long mails with </p>
<p>high sounding words fixed opinions. it tests one's patience. others </p>
<p>have dropped out of trying to converse with you and so shall i.</p>
<p>you certainly are not a man of few words and have a few pages to </p>
<p>write on everything and anything.</p>
<p>your condescending attitude towards everything else borders on funny.</p>
<p>its a new experience to counter such a person in this group.</p>

<p>  gandhis last moments were described by the people standing closest <br />to <br />  him in the most differing ways.<br />  not assumptions based on godse's version.<br />  what i am saying is based on a full scale research for a set of <br />books <br />  we are planning on gandhi. <br />  we are having a book on the salt march by a eminent writer who re <br />  enacted the entire march at the age of 70.<br />  muruganandam ofcourse has started his work on the godse trial. we <br />  hope the book will be explanatory to many who dont know much about <br />  those two three years.<br />  I think we will do a book on these private life aspects too. I dont <br />  think you cannot divorce a public and private life of a person who <br />is <br />  the father of a nation.</p>
<p>  on gandhi's personal life, he himself tried to be an open book and <br />  beleived that "caesars wife should be above suspicion"<br />  but this dark secret of him, his obsession with a married woman who <br />  he be wanted to be the guiding spirit of the freedom movement.<br />  eople have a right to know and right to discuss. you just cant wish <br />  it away.<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>    Dear Venkat</p>
<p>    Gandhi as a freedom fighter - a national leader for the freedom <br />  movement was the greatest we can ever imagine. <br />    Gandhi as a personal man - i reserve my comments, i feel <br />unethical <br />  to comment on that. What his sons say are their views. <br />    Gandhi as a spiritual (not religious) - he was highly evolved, <br />  selfish may be, but very highly evolved. <br />    Gandhi as a politician or cross religion patron - he was not <br />  convincing, he was trying to force the hindu dharma from Gita to <br />the <br />  moslem world, it would not work. </p>
<p>    Ghodse does not say - I know Gandhi said ahh...i heard him loud n <br />  clear. Hey Ram or Rama Rama etc... how the hell did it come from ? <br />  Anti Gandhians can always support Ghodse for his words. Come what <br />  may, what Ghodse thought as a reason is different, but he IS a <br />  murderer and a murderer of the nations greatest freedom fighter. <br />  There ends the story.<br />    Hey Ram or Rama or Ram Ram what ever be it... it has the sound of <br />  Rama in many versions... in a weak man's tome ghodse standing 1 <br />meter <br />  away and his mind ringing on murder the odds of him hearing rama in <br />a <br />  feeble tone can be sounding as aah. </p>
<p>    Gandhi was against hindu's ? I would object to that, Gandhi's <br />  biggest mistake was trying to provincialize hindu model of life <br />  everywhere, it wont work. Only a true hindu can decipher and write <br />  about the bagavat gita.<br />    There are aethists, there are non hindu's. There is nothing wrong <br />  in being either, its one's choice, to try to bridge-in was the <br />  difficult thing, for a evolved person. Again, I am not saying <br />Gandhi <br />  is a saint. There were great saints such as Sai Baba or Shiridi or <br />  Kabir who tried this unity - did it work ? It wont atleast for the <br />  long haul. It never has, but that does not mean hindu and moslem <br />and <br />  christians cannot co exsist. We all can and we all will. </p>
<p>    I dont think I can believe the one man version of 'ahh' vs many <br />  versions of Rama (hey ram, rama, ram ram etc). In today's world, <br />for <br />  a human, unless Rama or Muruga owes him money, its difficult to <br />  produce that name at the very end.</p>

<p>    Venkat,</p>
<p>    I think, all these mails written were to highlight only one <br />aspect, <br />    dont look at things only in one sided, please see the other side <br />as <br />    well. YOu have been seeing only the good of British and the ills <br />of <br />    Indians and thats why you call this mail as a controversy.</p>
<p>    During my college days, I got an oppurtunity to participate in an <br />    eloqution competion held in Wardha, conducted by the Gandhi seva <br />    trust. Topic was about Gandhi. Thats the first time I got an <br />    oppurtunity to read about Gandhi, and ofcourse Freedom at <br />Midnight <br />  was <br />    my reference. I read that book for almost two weeks, weeping as I <br />  read <br />    through the pages. I got so attached to Gandhi that my friends <br />  started <br />    teasing me 'pseudo Gandhi', meaning I am making a drama claiming <br />    myself a fan of Gandhi.</p>
<p>    Later, when i happened to see Kamal's Hey Ram, I got a new <br />  dimension <br />    about Gandhi. Though it was shocking, on further analysis, <br />reading <br />    something about why Godse killed Gandhi, I started realising the <br />  other <br />    side of the coin. </p>
<p>    With the information I have, I respect Gandhi for his greatness, <br />  the <br />    ahimsa and sathyagraha, the will power he showed, the dedication <br />in <br />    getting India's freedom etc, but when it comes to Hindu-Muslim <br />  unity <br />    and Gandhi's approach towards it, I do have a bitter taste about <br />  him. </p>
<p>    These are facts and we should accept it as it is. Claiming it as <br />    controversy or contradiction is hypocrasy, because facts are <br />facts.</p>

<p>There are two types of people my friend, the people type who follow Ramayanam and the people who follow iravana kaviyam... the people who say Jesus was a Saint and God send ...and the people who think he was a joke... the people who say Gandhi was a great man...so on and so forth.

        <p>hi</p>
<p>gandhis last moments were described by the people standing closest to <br />him in the most differing ways.<br />not assumptions based on godse's version.<br />what i am saying is based on a full scale research for a set of books <br />we are planning on gandhi. <br />we are having a book on the salt march by a eminent writer who re <br />enacted the entire march at the age of 70.<br />muruganandam ofcourse has started his work on the godse trial. we <br />hope the book will be explanatory to many who dont know much about <br />those two three years.<br />I think we will do a book on these private life aspects too. I dont <br />think you cannot divorce a public and private life of a person who is <br />the father of a nation.</p>
<p>on gandhi's personal life, he himself tried to be an open book and <br />beleived that "caesars wife should be above suspicion"<br />but this dark secret of him, his obsession with a married woman who <br />he be wanted to be the guiding spirit of the freedom movement.<br />eople have a right to know and right to discuss. you just cant wish <br />it away.<br />venketesh</p>

Thats the first time I got an <br />oppurtunity to read about Gandhi, and ofcourse Freedom at Midnight was <br />my reference. I read that book for almost two weeks, weeping as I read <br />through the pages. I got so attached to Gandhi that my friends started <br />teasing me 'pseudo Gandhi', meaning I am making a drama claiming <br />myself a fan of Gandhi.</p>
<p>Later, when i happened to see Kamal's Hey Ram, I got a new dimension <br />about Gandhi. Though it was shocking, on further analysis, reading <br />something about why Godse killed Gandhi, I started realising the other <br />side of the coin. </p>
<p>With the information I have, I respect Gandhi for his greatness, the <br />ahimsa and sathyagraha, the will power he showed, the dedication in <br />getting India's freedom etc, but when it comes to Hindu-Muslim unity <br />and Gandhi's approach towards it, I do have a bitter taste about him. </p>
<p>These are facts and we should accept it as it is. Claiming it as <br />controversy or contradiction is hypocrasy, because facts are facts.</p>

        <p>-Hi</p>
<p>Gopal Godse claims nathuram brought his hands together in respect  <br />for what gandhi had done to the nation.<br />but then it was such a turmoil there at the spot of the asasination.<br />there are so many views onto what actually hppened. one group <br />claiming no last words were uttered and one group claiming a bihari <br />gardner actually chased nathuram and pinned him down to the ground.<br />even the police fir is a utterly chaotic document.<br />kalyanam a south indian P.A of gandhi wrote plenty on the last day <br />but another group claims kalyanam was not even nearby.<br />one question remained. why was gandhi not taken to a hospital when he <br />was declared dead only much later.<br />also another impotant event that took place that day was margret <br />burke white the lay who took all those best last month photos of <br />gandhi tried to photograph the freshly dead gandhi, but feroze gandhi <br />who was in delhi shooed her away.<br />so we dont have any pictures.<br />nathuram fiercely said he had nothing to do with savarkar another co <br />acused and savarkar was acquitted. but 40 years later " the Hindu" <br />cme into possesion of letters and documents mentioning both had been <br />very close.<br />its a very interesting period in history. once again very few <br />deatails both clouded by hindu mahasabha or nationalistic attitudes.</p>

<p>    Hi,</p>
<p>    views differ - mine certainly did - after i read freedom at <br />    midnight..but it was mainly due to mahatma's role post <br />  independance -<br />    please read the book and his feat of stopping the violence in <br />    bengal. its first point view of Lord Mountbatten...he talks of <br />not <br />    having enough neutral corps to ensure peace in the three vital <br />    spots - lahore, amritsar and bengal. so he sends half his troops <br />  to <br />    lahore and the other half to amritsar...not having enough to <br />send <br />  to <br />    bengal he sends his one man army - requests mahatma to go to <br />    bengal...</p>

<p>    two differing accounts</p>
<p>    <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/world/main2415455.shtml" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/world/main2415455.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/world/main2415455.shtml</a><br />    <swf file="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34jm36ZloOA" height="344" width="425" action="swftools_swf_display_direct"></swf></p>
<p>    Godse shot Gandhi three times. Pitaji heard Gandhi utter the <br />    words, "Hai ram [Oh God] ... Hai ram ... Hai Ram" as he hit the <br />    ground. </p>
<p>    Instead of attacking Godse, Pitaji, along with Gandhi's nieces <br />  Manu <br />    and Abha, picked up Gandhi's body and rushed him to nearby Birla <br />    house. Pitaji carried Gandhi by the head. </p>
<p>    It was there that Gandhi was pronounced dead</p>
<p>    <a href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html" title="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html">http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html</a></p>
<p>    TIME: But surely it takes more than good publicity to create a <br />    Gandhi? <br />    Godse: There is another thing. Generally in the Indian masses, <br />    people are attracted toward saintism. Gandhi was shrewd to use <br />his <br />    saintdom for politics. After his death the government used him. <br />  The <br />    government knew that he was an enemy of Hindus, but they wanted <br />to <br />    show that he was a staunch Hindu. So the first act they did was <br />to <br />    put "Hey Ram" into Gandhi's dead mouth. </p>
<p>    TIME: You mean that he did not say "Hey Ram" as he died? <br />    Godse: No, he did not say it. You see, it was an automatic <br />pistol. <br />    It had a magazine for nine bullets but there were actually seven <br />  at <br />    that time. And once you pull the trigger, within a second, all <br />the <br />    seven bullets had passed. When these bullets pass through <br />crucial <br />    points like the heart, consciousness is finished. You have no <br />    strength. </p>
<p>    When Nathuram saw Gandhi was coming, he took out the pistol and <br />    folded his hands with the pistol inside it. There was one girl <br />  very <br />    close to Gandhi. He feared that he would hurt the girl. So he <br />went <br />    forward and with his left hand pushed her aside and shot. It <br />    happened within one second. You see, there was a film and some <br />    Kingsley fellow had acted as Gandhi. Someone asked me whether <br />  Gandhi <br />    said, "Hey Ram." I said Kingsley did say it. But Gandhi did not. <br />    Because that was not a drama. </p>

<p>    The next moment I fired at Gandhi. Gandhi was very weak, there <br />was <br />  a <br />    feeble sound like 'aah' from him and he fell down. </p>
<p>    Those who were close to me saw the weapon in my hand. They <br />rushed <br />    away from the spot. Gandhi had fallen to the ground, I was <br />  standing <br />    and the crowd had formed a ring around us.</p></vj_episteme@></p></blockquote>

<p>hi,</p>
<p>No one is applauding anyone, everyone had/has a right to be heard. <br />there are two signs for every coin. as rightly said the mahatma was <br />trying / testing out his new concepts - not all of which were ` <br />scientifically correct' and he did reverse some of his own views. he <br />did not allow use of medicines on his wife...she suffered from <br />chronic bronchitis, contracted pneumonia ( the british volunteered <br />to fly penicillin) but he refused to permit the use and she passed <br />away - would she have survived is not my point, but there is <br />speculation that later on he allowed western medicine for his fav <br />nephew....his experiments with brahmacharya and self control are <br />subjects that cannot be discussed in this forum. </p>

<p>a person following your text might have thought that it was nathuram.<br />nathuram never gave interviews and even his testimony was banned.<br />did you know this gopal godse's son was married to savarkar's <br />daughter.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  two differing accounts</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/world/main2415455.shtml" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/world/main2415455.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/world/main2415455.shtml</a><br />  <swf file="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34jm36ZloOA" height="344" width="425" action="swftools_swf_display_direct"></swf></p>
<p>  Godse shot Gandhi three times. Pitaji heard Gandhi utter the <br />  words, "Hai ram [Oh God] ... Hai ram ... Hai Ram" as he hit the <br />  ground. </p>
<p>  Instead of attacking Godse, Pitaji, along with Gandhi's nieces Manu <br />  and Abha, picked up Gandhi's body and rushed him to nearby Birla <br />  house. Pitaji carried Gandhi by the head. </p>
<p>  It was there that Gandhi was pronounced dead</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html" title="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html">http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html</a></p>
<p>  TIME: But surely it takes more than good publicity to create a <br />  Gandhi? <br />  Godse: There is another thing. Generally in the Indian masses, <br />  people are attracted toward saintism. Gandhi was shrewd to use his <br />  saintdom for politics. After his death the government used him. The <br />  government knew that he was an enemy of Hindus, but they wanted to <br />  show that he was a staunch Hindu. So the first act they did was to <br />  put "Hey Ram" into Gandhi's dead mouth. </p>
<p>  TIME: You mean that he did not say "Hey Ram" as he died? <br />  Godse: No, he did not say it. You see, it was an automatic pistol. <br />  It had a magazine for nine bullets but there were actually seven at <br />  that time. And once you pull the trigger, within a second, all the <br />  seven bullets had passed. When these bullets pass through crucial <br />  points like the heart, consciousness is finished. You have no <br />  strength. </p>
<p>  When Nathuram saw Gandhi was coming, he took out the pistol and <br />  folded his hands with the pistol inside it. There was one girl very <br />  close to Gandhi. He feared that he would hurt the girl. So he went <br />  forward and with his left hand pushed her aside and shot. It <br />  happened within one second. You see, there was a film and some <br />  Kingsley fellow had acted as Gandhi. Someone asked me whether <br />Gandhi <br />  said, "Hey Ram." I said Kingsley did say it. But Gandhi did not. <br />  Because that was not a drama. </p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm" title="http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm">http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm</a></p>
<p>  The next moment I fired at Gandhi. Gandhi was very weak, there was <br />a <br />  feeble sound like 'aah' from him and he fell down. </p>
<p>  Those who were close to me saw the weapon in my hand. They rushed <br />  away from the spot. Gandhi had fallen to the ground, I was standing <br />  and the crowd had formed a ring around us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/world/main2415455.shtml" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/world/main2415455.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/world/main2415455.shtml</a><br /><swf file="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34jm36ZloOA" height="344" width="425" action="swftools_swf_display_direct"></swf></p>
<p>Godse shot Gandhi three times. Pitaji heard Gandhi utter the <br />words, "Hai ram [Oh God] ... Hai ram ... Hai Ram" as he hit the <br />ground. </p>
<p>Instead of attacking Godse, Pitaji, along with Gandhi's nieces Manu <br />and Abha, picked up Gandhi's body and rushed him to nearby Birla <br />house. Pitaji carried Gandhi by the head. </p>
<p>It was there that Gandhi was pronounced dead</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html" title="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html">http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html</a></p>
<p>TIME: But surely it takes more than good publicity to create a <br />Gandhi? <br />Godse: There is another thing. Generally in the Indian masses, <br />people are attracted toward saintism. Gandhi was shrewd to use his <br />saintdom for politics. After his death the government used him. The <br />government knew that he was an enemy of Hindus, but they wanted to <br />show that he was a staunch Hindu. So the first act they did was to <br />put "Hey Ram" into Gandhi's dead mouth. </p>
<p>TIME: You mean that he did not say "Hey Ram" as he died? <br />Godse: No, he did not say it. You see, it was an automatic pistol. <br />It had a magazine for nine bullets but there were actually seven at <br />that time. And once you pull the trigger, within a second, all the <br />seven bullets had passed. When these bullets pass through crucial <br />points like the heart, consciousness is finished. You have no <br />strength. </p>
<p>When Nathuram saw Gandhi was coming, he took out the pistol and <br />folded his hands with the pistol inside it. There was one girl very <br />close to Gandhi. He feared that he would hurt the girl. So he went <br />forward and with his left hand pushed her aside and shot. It <br />happened within one second. You see, there was a film and some <br />Kingsley fellow had acted as Gandhi. Someone asked me whether Gandhi <br />said, "Hey Ram." I said Kingsley did say it. But Gandhi did not. <br />Because that was not a drama. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm" title="http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm">http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jul/23godse3.htm</a></p>
<p>The next moment I fired at Gandhi. Gandhi was very weak, there was a <br />feeble sound like 'aah' from him and he fell down. </p>
<p>Those who were close to me saw the weapon in my hand. They rushed <br />away from the spot. Gandhi had fallen to the ground, I was standing <br />and the crowd had formed a ring around us. </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>oh ...now are we applauding ghodse :-) <br />Again, gandhi's family members may have actually hated him... i dont blame them either, what did he do to his family...<br />But.... only his family have the right to comment about that, outside of them it would be unethical to talk on his personal life... <br />We are allower to talk about Mahatma Gandhi, we talk about an unrepentant Ghodse... let me ask one thing to many people who believe in God here, is it easy to get a 'anthima smrithi' ? Hey Ram or Rama Rama... how many people die with that name on their lips ? Just a thought on why he was a mahatma.</p>
