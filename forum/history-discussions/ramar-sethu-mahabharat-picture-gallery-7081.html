<p>Dear Vancheeswaran Gopal,</p>
<p>You have made a comment as ".....The discussion re: Krishna and the<br />Mahabharata in Maiyyam doesn't hold water...."</p>
<p>In this connection I wish to draw your attention to the first para of<br />the Maiyyam article, which is as follows:</p>
<p>"......I have selected the version of "Mahabharatha" translated into<br />English Prose by "Mr Kisari Mohan Ganguli" from the original Sanskrit<br />Text of Sage Viysa, and published by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers<br />(Pvt) Ltd, New Delhi, India, from which the following have been<br />extracted... ..."</p>
<p>So in other words what "you are saying" is that - all what is said "in<br />the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Viyasa" - doesnot hold water,<br />because this is what has been highlighted by me in this Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>Please "read the articles or threads of others fully, understand it's<br />contents throughly, and then make comments".</p>
<p>Any how I am interested in answering one point raised by you - that is</p>
<p>".....I think</p>
<blockquote><p>  Sri Krishna and the Mahabharata belong to Dhwabara Yugam - i.e.<br />prior to Kali Yugam<br />  to which we all belong including the South Indian rulers like Chera,<br />Chola and Pandyas!<br />  How come these people find a place in the previous Yugam? Can you<br />clarify?.... .'</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an important point - I too had been pondering over for a long<br />time. In a nutshell what I have got to say is that the Mahabharatha<br />Epic cannot belong to the period of Dhwabara Yugam or to a period<br />about 3500 years ago as held upto now.</p>
<p>My simple argument is - how is that the royal dynasties of India such<br />as Cheras, Cholas, Pandiyas, Keralas, Karnatakas, Andhras, Sinhalas<br />(of Sri Lanka),Maghadas, Kalingas, Hunas, Parasikas, Sakas,Yavanas<br />Chinas, etc "all of the historical period after B.C.500" are mentioned<br />in the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa. </p>
<p>There are references in Mahabharatha - that Cholas Pandiyas and<br />Sinhalas were present at the Yaagam conducted by Prince Tharuma of the<br />Pandavas, and all the Tamil kings of that period - the Cheras<br />(Keralas), Cholas and Pandiyas have participated in the Mahabharatha War.</p>
<p>Sinhala history starts only from a period around B.C.550. Yavanas<br />originally referred only to Greeks, and we are aware king Alexander<br />invaded India only around B.C.550. Then there is a reference to the<br />Maghada king Jayatsena as follows from the Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>[23] "........... and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great strength<br />brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And<br />similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came<br />accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of<br />kings....."</p>
<p>MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31 </p>
<p>Now king Jayatsena was the Magahada king who ruled around second<br />century B.C. He is said to have participated in the Mahabharatha war.</p>
<p>All these points makes me think that Mahabharatha belonged to a period<br />after the king Jayatsena of Maghada which was after king Asoka,<br />possibly first century B.C. - which is further confimed by the fact<br />that Udhiyan Cheralaathan the father of Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan<br />of this period who is said to have provided food for the warriors in<br />the Mahabharatha war. </p>
<p>Based on all these points a "further through study on same have to be<br />made" on the actual Date of 'Mahabharatha war' - which couldnot have<br />been in the Dhwabara Yugam, but happened in the late Kaliyugam about<br />2200 years ago from date.</p>

<p>Dear Vira rajendra<br />your theory on mahabaratha after king ashoka is unique and must be the <br />only one such hypothesis available.<br />but are you aware it will upset the dasavathara theory( putting <br />krishna after buddha.)<br />it will also be contradicted by the archeological dating of the under <br />sea dwarka.<br />surely its tough to imagine a war of the scale of mahabaratha after <br />alexanders visit.</p>

<p>Madan,</p>
<p>Mostly the vessels are much smaller and not that heavy. Even heavy<br />vessels of those days might surely not be of the tonnage we talk about<br />today. So definitely it should have been possible for them to navigate<br />through the sethu.</p>
<p>Infact, I remember Marco describing the difference between Indian and<br />their vessels, where Indian vessels are much larger, heavier and<br />sturdy compared to theirs. And Indian vessels are compartmentalized so<br />that even if a plank is damaged, they can repair it without affecting<br />the other parts of the vessel because the compartment which is damaged<br />alone gets the water first, and they will have enough time to repair<br />that part while the rest of the compartments keep the ship floating.<br />This is another proof for Indian naval supremacy. But again even<br />heariver Indian vessels should have been much lighter to those of<br />current day vessels.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Again I find "no one have still given me a proper answer for what I<br />  highlighted from the original Mahabharatha". </p>
<p>Dear Vira rajendra</p></blockquote>
<p>I think you should get a paper ready on your hypothesis and send it <br />to the organisers of the mahabarat conference.( which seems to be <br />frequently held)<br />you may get a chance to present it before others who have worked on <br />that subject.</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<p>"Do you think you could enlighten me on same".</p>
<blockquote><p>  We will simply forget for the time being what the other Scholars say<br />  re the dates of Mahabharatha Epic, or what has been pointed out at<br />  various conferences, but I will like some one to only answer my<br />  questions on the text which is reproduced below. This is to findout<br />  how Sage Viyasa came about with the list of royal dynasties of India<br />  all of whom belong to the historical period after B.C.500.</p>
<p>  Reproduced: </p>
<p>  ".....My simple argument is - how is that the royal dynasties of <br />India<br />  such as Cheras, Cholas, Pandiyas, Keralas, Karnatakas, Andhras,<br />  Sinhalas (of Sri Lanka),Maghadas, Kalingas, Hunas, Parasikas,<br />  Sakas,Yavanas Chinas, etc "all of the historical period after <br />B.C.500"<br />  are mentioned in the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa.</p>
<p>  There are references in Mahabharatha - that Cholas Pandiyas and<br />  Sinhalas were present at the Yaagam conducted by Prince Tharuma of <br />the<br />  Pandavas, and all the Tamil kings of that period - the Cheras<br />  (Keralas), Cholas and Pandiyas have participated in the <br />Mahabharatha War.</p>
<p>  Sinhala history starts only from a period around B.C.550. Yavanas<br />  originally referred only to Greeks, and we are aware king Alexander<br />  invaded India only around B.C.550. Then there is a reference to the<br />  Maghada king Jayatsena as follows from the Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>  [23] "........... and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great <br />strength<br />  brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And<br />  similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came<br />  accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of<br />  kings....."</p>
<p>  MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31</p>
<p>  Now Jayatsena was a Mauriya king of Magahada who ruled around second<br />  century B.C. He is said to have participated in the Mahabharatha <br />war.</p>

<p>    Dear Vancheeswaran Gopal,</p>
<p>    You have made a comment as ".....The discussion re: Krishna and <br />the<br />    Mahabharata in Maiyyam doesn't hold water...."</p>
<p>    In this connection I wish to draw your attention to the first <br />para of<br />    the Maiyyam article, which is as follows:</p>
<p>    "......I have selected the version of "Mahabharatha" translated <br />into<br />    English Prose by "Mr Kisari Mohan Ganguli" from the original <br />Sanskrit<br />    Text of Sage Viysa, and published by Munshiram Manoharlal <br />Publishers<br />    (Pvt) Ltd, New Delhi, India, from which the following have been<br />    extracted... ..."</p>
<p>    So in other words what "you are saying" is that - all what is <br />said "in<br />    the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Viyasa" - doesnot hold <br />water,<br />    because this is what has been highlighted by me in this Maiyyam <br />article.</p>
<p>    Please "read the articles or threads of others fully, understand <br />it's<br />    contents throughly, and then make comments".</p>
<p>    Any how I am interested in answering one point raised by you - <br />that is</p>
<p>    ".....I think<br />      Sri Krishna and the Mahabharata belong to Dhwabara Yugam - i.e.<br />    prior to Kali Yugam<br />      to which we all belong including the South Indian rulers like <br />Chera,<br />    Chola and Pandyas!<br />      How come these people find a place in the previous Yugam? Can <br />you<br />    clarify?.... .'</p>
<p>    This is an important point - I too had been pondering over for a <br />long<br />    time. In a nutshell what I have got to say is that the <br />Mahabharatha<br />    Epic cannot belong to the period of Dhwabara Yugam or to a period<br />    about 3500 years ago as held upto now.</p>
<p>    My simple argument is - how is that the royal dynasties of India <br />such<br />    as Cheras, Cholas, Pandiyas, Keralas, Karnatakas, Andhras, <br />Sinhalas<br />    (of Sri Lanka),Maghadas, Kalingas, Hunas, Parasikas, Sakas,Yavanas<br />    Chinas, etc "all of the historical period after B.C.500" are <br />mentioned<br />    in the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa. </p>
<p>    There are references in Mahabharatha - that Cholas Pandiyas and<br />    Sinhalas were present at the Yaagam conducted by Prince Tharuma <br />of the<br />    Pandavas, and all the Tamil kings of that period - the Cheras<br />    (Keralas), Cholas and Pandiyas have participated in the <br />Mahabharatha<br />  War.</p>
<p>    Sinhala history starts only from a period around B.C.550. Yavanas<br />    originally referred only to Greeks, and we are aware king <br />Alexander<br />    invaded India only around B.C.550. Then there is a reference to <br />the<br />    Maghada king Jayatsena as follows from the Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>    [23] "........... and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great <br />strength<br />    brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And<br />    similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came<br />    accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of<br />    kings....."</p>
<p>    MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31 </p>
<p>    Now king Jayatsena was the Magahada king who ruled around second<br />    century B.C. He is said to have participated in the Mahabharatha <br />war.</p>
<p>    All these points makes me think that Mahabharatha belonged to a <br />period<br />    after the king Jayatsena of Maghada which was after king Asoka,<br />    possibly first century B.C. - which is further confimed by the <br />fact<br />    that Udhiyan Cheralaathan the father of Imayavaramban <br />Neduncheralathan<br />    of this period who is said to have provided food for the warriors <br />in<br />    the Mahabharatha war. </p>
<p>    Based on all these points a "further through study on same have <br />to be<br />    made" on the actual Date of 'Mahabharatha war' - which couldnot <br />have<br />    been in the Dhwabara Yugam, but happened in the late Kaliyugam <br />about<br />    2200 years ago from date.</p>

          Ramar Sethu &amp; Mahabharat picture gallery        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I am looking for the gallery/pictures too, where are they?</p>
<p>Dear Virarajendra, I think Venkat made a true attempt to address your <br />POV. I will try once again to the extent possible. The Mahabharat, as <br />I said before was a narrative of three phases. It is very hard to say <br />what was said in which phase and by whom. One. Second,anything that <br />is so many years old will have lot of interpolations and <br />interpretations of various manner. Third, we have seen via thala <br />puranams and other means that there are several fictitious kings with <br />dynasty names assigned as chola/pandya etc, does not mean they really <br />existed. Many times these connections are created to make the king or <br />royal family look bigger in eyes of the public as that was one of the <br />means they had in those days.</p>
<p>Lastly the most simple answer - we don't know and we will possibly <br />never know how much of this is 'factual'. The Mahabharat is not a <br />history book. Our love for the epic is not equal to obsession with <br />making it every line of it factual - it does not make Vyasa or <br />Valmiki or anyone liars, they never intended it to be 'factual truth' <br />more of a narrative with great moral and spiritual value. Rajaji <br />states this clearly in his Vyasar Virundhu that Vyasa created the <br />classic to enhance the moral and spiritual well being of the world.</p>
<p>I have answered this to the extent I know,</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Malathi</p>

<p>  Dear Gopal,</p>
<p>  Thanks for the maps, but where are they - uploaded to File <br />section ????</p>
<p>  Again I find "no one have still given me a proper answer for what I<br />  highlighted from the original Mahabharatha". </p>
<p>  "Do you think you could enlighten me on same".</p>
<p>  We will simply forget for the time being what the other Scholars say<br />  re the dates of Mahabharatha Epic, or what has been pointed out at<br />  various conferences, but I will like some one to only answer my<br />  questions on the text which is reproduced below. This is to findout<br />  how Sage Viyasa came about with the list of royal dynasties of India<br />  all of whom belong to the historical period after B.C.500.</p>
<p>  Reproduced: </p>
<p>  ".....My simple argument is - how is that the royal dynasties of <br />India<br />  such as Cheras, Cholas, Pandiyas, Keralas, Karnatakas, Andhras,<br />  Sinhalas (of Sri Lanka),Maghadas, Kalingas, Hunas, Parasikas,<br />  Sakas,Yavanas Chinas, etc "all of the historical period after <br />B.C.500"<br />  are mentioned in the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa.</p>
<p>  There are references in Mahabharatha - that Cholas Pandiyas and<br />  Sinhalas were present at the Yaagam conducted by Prince Tharuma of <br />the<br />  Pandavas, and all the Tamil kings of that period - the Cheras<br />  (Keralas), Cholas and Pandiyas have participated in the <br />Mahabharatha War.</p>
<p>  Sinhala history starts only from a period around B.C.550. Yavanas<br />  originally referred only to Greeks, and we are aware king Alexander<br />  invaded India only around B.C.550. Then there is a reference to the<br />  Maghada king Jayatsena as follows from the Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>  [23] "........... and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great <br />strength<br />  brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And<br />  similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came<br />  accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of<br />  kings....."</p>
<p>  MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31</p>
<p>  Now Jayatsena was a Mauriya king of Magahada who ruled around second<br />  century B.C. He is said to have participated in the Mahabharatha <br />war.</p>

<p>    Dear Vancheeswaran Gopal,</p>
<p>    You have made a comment as ".....The discussion re: Krishna and <br />the<br />    Mahabharata in Maiyyam doesn't hold water...."</p>
<p>    In this connection I wish to draw your attention to the first <br />para of<br />    the Maiyyam article, which is as follows:</p>
<p>    "......I have selected the version of "Mahabharatha" translated <br />into<br />    English Prose by "Mr Kisari Mohan Ganguli" from the original <br />Sanskrit<br />    Text of Sage Viysa, and published by Munshiram Manoharlal <br />Publishers<br />    (Pvt) Ltd, New Delhi, India, from which the following have been<br />    extracted... ..."</p>
<p>    So in other words what "you are saying" is that - all what is <br />said "in<br />    the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Viyasa" - doesnot hold <br />water,<br />    because this is what has been highlighted by me in this Maiyyam <br />article.</p>
<p>    Please "read the articles or threads of others fully, understand <br />it's<br />    contents throughly, and then make comments".</p>
<p>    Any how I am interested in answering one point raised by you - <br />that is</p>
<p>    ".....I think<br />      Sri Krishna and the Mahabharata belong to Dhwabara Yugam - i.e.<br />    prior to Kali Yugam<br />      to which we all belong including the South Indian rulers like <br />Chera,<br />    Chola and Pandyas!<br />      How come these people find a place in the previous Yugam? Can <br />you<br />    clarify?.... .'</p>
<p>    This is an important point - I too had been pondering over for a <br />long<br />    time. In a nutshell what I have got to say is that the <br />Mahabharatha<br />    Epic cannot belong to the period of Dhwabara Yugam or to a period<br />    about 3500 years ago as held upto now.</p>
<p>    My simple argument is - how is that the royal dynasties of India <br />such<br />    as Cheras, Cholas, Pandiyas, Keralas, Karnatakas, Andhras, <br />Sinhalas<br />    (of Sri Lanka),Maghadas, Kalingas, Hunas, Parasikas, Sakas,Yavanas<br />    Chinas, etc "all of the historical period after B.C.500" are <br />mentioned<br />    in the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa. </p>

Then there is a reference to <br />the<br />    Maghada king Jayatsena as follows from the Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>    [23] "........... and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great <br />strength<br />    brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops.

<p>    MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31 </p>
<p>    Now king Jayatsena was the Magahada king who ruled around second<br />    century B.C. He is said to have participated in the Mahabharatha <br />war.</p>
<p>    All these points makes me think that Mahabharatha belonged to a <br />period<br />    after the king Jayatsena of Maghada which was after king Asoka,<br />    possibly first century B.C. - which is further confimed by the <br />fact<br />    that Udhiyan Cheralaathan the father of Imayavaramban <br />Neduncheralathan<br />    of this period who is said to have provided food for the warriors <br />in<br />    the Mahabharatha war. </p>
<p>    Based on all these points a "further through study on same have <br />to be<br />    made" on the actual Date of 'Mahabharatha war' - which couldnot <br />have<br />    been in the Dhwabara Yugam, but happened in the late Kaliyugam <br />about<br />    2200 years ago from date.</p>

<p>Another question that arises to my mind, if this region was navigable then,<br />was it because the vessels were much smaller in size then? Or was it<br />maintained (I hear that sand fills up pretty quick in that region - which I<br />would presume it would owing to the big land masses, and the numerous small<br />islands, that can block large amounts of sand) for navigation?

<blockquote><p>  Just a food for thought... I see Marco Polo's map contains a sea route<br />  "through" the sethu... which begs the question - If this region was<br />  navigable during Marco Polo's time, does it mean that the setu did not exist<br />  then?</p>
<p>  Am asking this question, as I have heard people claim that the sethu<br />  existed for a long time, and that there are literary evidences till the 11th<br />  Century AD, IIRC.</p>

        <p>of course, Marco Polo's map (<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marco_Polo._Map_of_explore.jpg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marco_Polo._Map_of_explore.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marco_Polo._Map_of_explore.jpg</a>) dates<br />1271-1295 AD... which is the 11th Centry AD... any inferences?</p>
<p>Another question that arises to my mind, if this region was navigable then,<br />was it because the vessels were much smaller in size then? Or was it<br />maintained (I hear that sand fills up pretty quick in that region - which I<br />would presume it would owing to the big land masses, and the numerous small<br />islands, that can block large amounts of sand) for navigation? Any thoughts?</p>

<blockquote><p>  Just a food for thought... I see Marco Polo's map contains a sea route<br />  "through" the sethu... which begs the question - If this region was<br />  navigable during Marco Polo's time, does it mean that the setu did not exist<br />  then?</p>
<p>  Am asking this question, as I have heard people claim that the sethu<br />  existed for a long time, and that there are literary evidences till the 11th<br />  Century AD, IIRC.</p>

<p>   Dear Vancheeswaran Gopal,</p>
<p>   You have made a comment as ".....The discussion re: Krishna and the<br />   Mahabharata in Maiyyam doesn't hold water....."</p>
<p>   In this connection I wish to draw your attention to the first para of<br />   the Maiyyam article, which is as follows:</p>
<p>   "......I have selected the version of "Mahabharatha" translated into<br />   English Prose by "Mr Kisari Mohan Ganguli" from the original Sanskrit<br />   Text of Sage Viysa, and published by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers<br />   (Pvt) Ltd, New Delhi, India, from which the following have been<br />   extracted... ..."</p>
<p>   So in other words what "you are saying" is that - all what is said "in<br />   the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Viyasa" - doesnot hold water,<br />   because this is what has been highlighted by me in this Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>   Please "read the articles or threads of others fully, understand it's<br />   contents throughly, and then make comments".</p>
<p>   Any how I am interested in answering one point raised by you - that is</p>
<p>   ".....I think<br />     Sri Krishna and the Mahabharata belong to Dhwabara Yugam - i.e.<br />   prior to Kali Yugam<br />     to which we all belong including the South Indian rulers like Chera,<br />   Chola and Pandyas!<br />     How come these people find a place in the previous Yugam? Can you<br />   clarify?.... .'</p>
<p>   This is an important point - I too had been pondering over for a long<br />   time. In a nutshell what I have got to say is that the Mahabharatha<br />   Epic cannot belong to the period of Dhwabara Yugam or to a period<br />   about 3500 years ago as held upto now.</p>
<p>   My simple argument is - how is that the royal dynasties of India such<br />   as Cheras, Cholas, Pandiyas, Keralas, Karnatakas, Andhras, Sinhalas<br />   (of Sri Lanka),Maghadas, Kalingas, Hunas, Parasikas, Sakas,Yavanas<br />   Chinas, etc "all of the historical period after B.C.500" are mentioned<br />   in the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa.</p>
<p>   There are references in Mahabharatha - that Cholas Pandiyas and<br />   Sinhalas were present at the Yaagam conducted by Prince Tharuma of the<br />   Pandavas, and all the Tamil kings of that period - the Cheras<br />   (Keralas), Cholas and Pandiyas have participated in the Mahabharatha War.</p>
<p>   Sinhala history starts only from a period around B.C.550. Yavanas<br />   originally referred only to Greeks, and we are aware king Alexander<br />   invaded India only around B.C.550. Then there is a reference to the<br />   Maghada king Jayatsena as follows from the Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>   [23] "........... and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great strength<br />   brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And<br />   similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came<br />   accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of<br />   kings....."</p>
<p>   MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31</p>
<p>   Now king Jayatsena was the Magahada king who ruled around second<br />   century B.C. He is said to have participated in the Mahabharatha war.</p>
<p>   All these points makes me think that Mahabharatha belonged to a period<br />   after the king Jayatsena of Maghada which was after king Asoka,<br />   possibly first century B.C. - which is further confimed by the fact<br />   that Udhiyan Cheralaathan the father of Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan<br />   of this period who is said to have provided food for the warriors in<br />   the Mahabharatha war.</p>
<p>   Based on all these points a "further through study on same have to be<br />   made" on the actual Date of 'Mahabharatha war' - which couldnot have<br />   been in the Dhwabara Yugam, but happened in the late Kaliyugam about<br />   2200 years ago from date.</p>

<p>  Based on all these points a "further through study on same have to be<br />  made" on the actual Date of 'Mahabharatha war' - which couldnot have<br />  been in the Dhwabara Yugam, but happened in the late Kaliyugam about<br />  2200 years ago from date.</p>

<p>  Dear Vancheeswaran Gopal,</p>
<p>  You have made a comment as ".....The discussion re: Krishna and the<br />  Mahabharata in Maiyyam doesn't hold water....."</p>
<p>  In this connection I wish to draw your attention to the first para of<br />  the Maiyyam article, which is as follows:</p>
<p>  "......I have selected the version of "Mahabharatha" translated into<br />  English Prose by "Mr Kisari Mohan Ganguli" from the original Sanskrit<br />  Text of Sage Viysa, and published by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers<br />  (Pvt) Ltd, New Delhi, India, from which the following have been<br />  extracted... ..."</p>
<p>  So in other words what "you are saying" is that - all what is said "in<br />  the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Viyasa" - doesnot hold water,<br />  because this is what has been highlighted by me in this Maiyyam <br />  article.</p>
<p>  Please "read the articles or threads of others fully, understand it's<br />  contents throughly, and then make comments".</p>
<p>  Any how I am interested in answering one point raised by you - that is</p>
<p>  ".....I think<br />    Sri Krishna and the Mahabharata belong to Dhwabara Yugam - i.e.<br />  prior to Kali Yugam<br />    to which we all belong including the South Indian rulers like Chera,<br />  Chola and Pandyas!<br />    How come these people find a place in the previous Yugam? Can you<br />  clarify?.... .'</p>
<p>  This is an important point - I too had been pondering over for a long<br />  time. In a nutshell what I have got to say is that the Mahabharatha<br />  Epic cannot belong to the period of Dhwabara Yugam or to a period<br />  about 3500 years ago as held upto now.</p>
<p>  My simple argument is - how is that the royal dynasties of India such<br />  as Cheras, Cholas, Pandiyas, Keralas, Karnatakas, Andhras, Sinhalas<br />  (of Sri Lanka),Maghadas, Kalingas, Hunas, Parasikas, Sakas,Yavanas<br />  Chinas, etc "all of the historical period after B.C.500" are mentioned<br />  in the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa.</p>
<p>  There are references in Mahabharatha - that Cholas Pandiyas and<br />  Sinhalas were present at the Yaagam conducted by Prince Tharuma of the<br />  Pandavas, and all the Tamil kings of that period - the Cheras<br />  (Keralas), Cholas and Pandiyas have participated in the <br />  Mahabharatha War.</p>
<p>  Sinhala history starts only from a period around B.C.550. Yavanas<br />  originally referred only to Greeks, and we are aware king Alexander<br />  invaded India only around B.C.550. Then there is a reference to the<br />  Maghada king Jayatsena as follows from the Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>  [23] "........... and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great strength<br />  brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And<br />  similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came<br />  accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of<br />  kings....."</p>
<p>  MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31</p>
<p>  Now king Jayatsena was the Magahada king who ruled around second<br />  century B.C. He is said to have participated in the Mahabharatha war.</p>
<p>  All these points makes me think that Mahabharatha belonged to a period<br />  after the king Jayatsena of Maghada which was after king Asoka,<br />  possibly first century B.C. - which is further confimed by the fact<br />  that Udhiyan Cheralaathan the father of Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan<br />  of this period who is said to have provided food for the warriors in<br />  the Mahabharatha war.</p>

        <p>Dear Gopal,</p>
<p>Thanks for the maps, but where are they - uploaded to File section ????</p>
<p>Again I find "no one have still given me a proper answer for what I<br />highlighted from the original Mahabharatha". </p>
<p>"Do you think you could enlighten me on same".</p>
<p>We will simply forget for the time being what the other Scholars say<br />re the dates of Mahabharatha Epic, or what has been pointed out at<br />various conferences, but I will like some one to only answer my<br />questions on the text which is reproduced below. This is to findout<br />how Sage Viyasa came about with the list of royal dynasties of India<br />all of whom belong to the historical period after B.C.500.</p>
<p>Reproduced: </p>
<p>".....My simple argument is - how is that the royal dynasties of India<br />such as Cheras, Cholas, Pandiyas, Keralas, Karnatakas, Andhras,<br />Sinhalas (of Sri Lanka),Maghadas, Kalingas, Hunas, Parasikas,<br />Sakas,Yavanas Chinas, etc "all of the historical period after B.C.500"<br />are mentioned in the original Sanskrit Mahabharatha of Sage Viyasa.</p>
<p>There are references in Mahabharatha - that Cholas Pandiyas and<br />Sinhalas were present at the Yaagam conducted by Prince Tharuma of the<br />Pandavas, and all the Tamil kings of that period - the Cheras<br />(Keralas), Cholas and Pandiyas have participated in the Mahabharatha War.</p>
<p>Sinhala history starts only from a period around B.C.550. Yavanas<br />originally referred only to Greeks, and we are aware king Alexander<br />invaded India only around B.C.550. Then there is a reference to the<br />Maghada king Jayatsena as follows from the Maiyyam article.</p>
<p>[23] "........... and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great strength<br />brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And<br />similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came<br />accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of<br />kings....."</p>
<p>MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31</p>
<p>Now Jayatsena was a Mauriya king of Magahada who ruled around second<br />century B.C. He is said to have participated in the Mahabharatha war.</p>

<p>  [23] "........... and the king of Magadha Jayatsena of great strength<br />  brought with him for Yudhishthira an Akshauhini of troops. And<br />  similarly Pandya who dwelt on the coast-land near the sea, came<br />  accompanied by troops of various kinds to Yudhishthira the king of<br />  kings....."</p>
<p>  MAHABHARATHA - UDYOGA PARVA, PAGE 31 </p>
<p>  Now king Jayatsena was the Magahada king who ruled around second<br />  century B.C. He is said to have participated in the Mahabharatha war.</p>
<p>  All these points makes me think that Mahabharatha belonged to a period<br />  after the king Jayatsena of Maghada which was after king Asoka,<br />  possibly first century B.C. - which is further confimed by the fact<br />  that Udhiyan Cheralaathan the father of Imayavaramban Neduncheralathan<br />  of this period who is said to have provided food for the warriors in<br />  the Mahabharatha war. </p>
<p>  Based on all these points a "further through study on same have to be<br />  made" on the actual Date of 'Mahabharatha war' - which couldnot have<br />  been in the Dhwabara Yugam, but happened in the late Kaliyugam about<br />  2200 years ago from date.</p>

<p>    Hi Friend:<br />    ?<br />    The discussion re: Krishna and the Mahabharata in Maiyyam doesn't<br />  hold water.?
