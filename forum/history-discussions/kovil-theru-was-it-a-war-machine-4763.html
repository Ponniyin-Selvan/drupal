</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Always wondered on the use of temple theru - we always grew up <br />watching the ther pulling rituals along mylapore - the thanga teru <br />in tiruchendur to the elaborately carved ( one of the biggest in <br />south india) - in avinashi ( you cant miss it as you drive from <br />coimbatore to tirupur)</p>
<p>.. the height, solid construction, huge wheels... why make <br />something that is so cumbersome to move - obviously it could not be <br />pulled by yoked animals - meaning it couldnt go fast. why put the <br />deity at such a large height, even though you could say it gives <br />everyone a view to the deity - the utsavars are normally pint sized <br />versions of the mulavars. With all the decorations you would be <br />lucky to get a glance of the god on top of some of the larger the'rs.</p>
<p>I dont remember where, but i saw a discription that the traditional <br />temple cart ( kovil theru) was infact a war machine - an armoured <br />car - precussor to the tank but with height....to reach the ramparts <br />of a fort giving the archers protection...with ability to pour down <br />hot oil etc etc - was this what gave the cholas the superiority. <br />Intersting to see the evolution of the temple carts - where they in <br />vougue before the cholas.</p>
<p>could it be that in peace time they were put to use in temples </p>

<blockquote><p>    During the British colonial era, Christian missionaries <br />promulgated <br />  a <br />    fallacy that Hindu devotees of Krishna were lunatic fanatics who <br />    threw themselves under the wheels of these chariots in order to <br />    attain salvation. Such a description can also be found in the <br />  popular <br />    fourteenth-century work "The Travels of Sir John Mandeville." </p></blockquote>
<p>Ra.Ki.Rangarajan's 'Naan Krishna Deva Rayan' has a climax which is <br />spun around this concept of throwing oneself under the wheel of theru. <br />Did RaKiRa bought this idea from this promulgation or did he got any <br />evidence for this???</p>

        <p>Siege Tower</p>
<p><a href="http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/siege-tower.htm" title="http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/siege-tower.htm">http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/siege-tower.htm</a> </p>
<p>A device used during the Middle Ages ( Medieval period ) in siege <br />warfare. The Siege Tower was designed to to protect the soldiers <br />attacking the defensive walls of a castle, town or fortress </p>
<p>Description and Siege Tower Design<br />The Siege Tower was designed to to protect the soldiers attacking <br />the defensive walls of a castle, town or fortress. It was also <br />designed to hold soldiers and siege weapons. The siege tower was <br />usually a tall, rectangular construction with four wheels and a <br />height roughly equal to that of the wall or sometimes higher. The <br />siege tower mechanism carried scores of soldiers, who climbed <br />ladders to move between the different levels of a siege tower. </p>
<p>Siege Tower Coverings<br />The relative safety offered by the Siege tower from missiles or <br />fire was due to the cover that it offered the soldiers. The <br />framework of the siege tower was covered in animal hides. At the <br />last minute when the siege tower was about to be rolled or wheeled <br />into place the hides were soaked in mud and vinegar to add further <br />protection. There were even iron plates which could be added to the <br />siege towers, although this was an extremely expensive option.</p>
<p>Siege Tower Objectives<br />The objective of a siege tower was to allow soldiers to mount a <br />direct and close attack on a fortification - castle, fortress or <br />town. Siege Towers were usually constructed with wheels and reached <br />3 stories in height. A siege tower was a multipurpose machine which <br />could hold men, their weapons and even small siege engines from <br />close-range positions of relative safety. Mangonels were sometimes <br />placed at the top of the siege tower. </p>
<p>Siege Tower Variations<br />The relative safety offered by the Siege tower from missiles or fire <br />led to a series of siege tower variations. A horizontal version of a <br />siege tower was developed to provide cover for a battering ram. <br />Conventional siege towers were also known to have a battering ram <br />built into the lowest level of the structure. Each siege tower was <br />designed to suit the requirements of the wall it was required to <br />attack.</p>
<p>Siege Tower History<br />Siege Tower history dates back to antiquity. The Siege Tower is <br />believed to be an ancient war engine which was used in China and by <br />the Romans and Greeks. Records of major English sieges of the Middle <br />Ages mention the use of siege towers. It was not uncommon for the <br />defenders also to build siege towers to directly oppose those of the <br />attackers. A siege tower was used at the siege of Kenilworth Castle <br />in 1266. Records show that the siege tower held two hundred archers <br />and eleven siege engines. </p>
<p>Preparing to use the Siege Tower<br />Many preparations had to be made before using a siege tower. Many <br />castles and fortresses were surrounded by moats and ditches so <br />before the tower could be moved near the walls the moat or ditch had <br />to be filled with rubble and earth. The ground leading up to the <br />required position had to be chosen to allow for easy transportation <br />of the siege tower.</p>
<p>Attacking with the Siege Tower<br />When all was ready the siege tower would be rolled, pushed or <br />wheeled into into place next to the wall. Men were positioned on all <br />levels. The drawbridge on the top deck was lowered, like a <br />gangplank, enabling the soldiers to rush forward on to the wall of <br />the fortification. As men departed from the siege tower <br />reinforcements moved upwards from the lower levels which added <br />weight to the initial assault. Not all the soldiers left the Siege <br />tower. They were often were defended by archers shooting through <br />arrow slits. </p>
<p>Building a Siege Tower<br />Building a Siege Tower required the design and building skills. <br />Siege weapons, such as the Siege Tower, were made to order! They <br />were far too cumbersome to move from one place to another. In a <br />siege situation the commander would assess the situation and the <br />siege weapons design requirements to break a siege.</p>

<p>BASICALLY FOUR-WHEELERS, MOUNTED ON HEAVY WOODEN SECION - KIND OF <br />RECTANGLE FRAME USING 4 SOLID WOODS CROSS-TIED TO FORM AN INNER-<br />SQUARE. ABOVE THE FRAME, MOSTLY OCTAGONAL WOODEN STRUCTURE RAISED, <br />LIKE " V " - from frame square projecting above the wheels. this <br />also made of wooden frames and covered on top with wooden planks.</p>
<p>as such, though, the wheel, the frame and the octagonal plank looks <br />solid, most of them are on framed structure, except the solid wheel, <br />made of solid wood, multiple- sectioned.</p>
<p>That is the basic THEREU..... SKELETON.</p>
<p>The Pillars / stems above that, Top roof, and the puller-wooden <br />horses, other miniature decoratives are all ACCESSORIES TO basic <br />model.</p>

<p>    Hi,</p>
<p>    1) Now - we are looking at two the'rs - the correct word to be <br />  used <br />    for the ones used by our gods ( and kings - ok kings were gods <br />  those <br />    days) would be ratham - horse drawn chariots. I dont think our <br />    temple carts resemble chariots in any way..</p>
<p>    2) Also when you talk of large temple carts and the popular <br />    festivals - most of them seem to be linked with chola temples. <br />  later <br />    day temples could have just continued based on their formula. </p>
<p>    3) I have seen a couple of contemporary temple carts being <br />built - <br />    they are built with solid team beams - meaning the structure is <br />    mostly hollow ( to allow movement inside and to keep it light). </p>
<p>    4) We also know that these temple carts were usually plated with <br />    metal ( thanga theer - velli theer) - the wood is already <br />  elaborate <br />    carved and it would have been easier to just paint them with <br />  bright <br />    colors - why go through the rigmarole of painstakingly metal <br />  plating <br />    the entire structure. </p>
<p>    5) Normally the back of the diety is not seen /shown ( for <br />  obviously <br />    purposes) - you are not allowed to circumabulate the inside of <br />  garba <br />    graham - you only do the outside. so why is the temple cart open <br />  on <br />    all four sides?</p>
<p>    6) Ok, you build a tall structure with a high pedestal to <br />display <br />    the idol. common sense would be to give it a flight of steps or <br />    atleast some padi/foothold/hand rail on the outside. Why is <br />there <br />  a <br />    complete absense of such tools to get up the theru on the <br />ouside. <br />    Its almost immpossible to climb without assistance /external <br />  ladder. <br />    Is it built to keep people out...</p>
<p>    If someone can look up any temple cart ( preferably old in their <br />    pristine condition) and post some snaps of the internal plan of <br />  the <br />    base and the cone on top - we could see more..</p>

<p>        The term juggernaut is used to describe any literal or <br />    metaphorical <br />        force regarded as unstoppable that will crush all in its <br />path. <br />    In <br />        Britain, it is also used to refer to any large and heavy <br />lorry.</p>
<p>        The word is derived from the Sanskrit Jagann&#257;tha <br />(meaning <br />      "Lord of <br />        the universe") which is one of the many names of Krishna <br />from <br />    the <br />        ancient Vedic scriptures of India. <br />        One of the most famous of Indian temples is the Jagannath <br />  Temple <br />    in <br />        Puri, Orissa, which has the Ratha Yatra (chariot <br />procession), <br />  an <br />        annual procession of chariots carrying the murtis/statues of <br />        Jagann⴨ (Krishna), Subhadra and Baladeva (Krishna's elder <br />      brother). </p>

<p>        During the British colonial era, Christian missionaries <br />    promulgated <br />      a <br />        fallacy that Hindu devotees of Krishna were lunatic fanatics <br />  who <br />        threw themselves under the wheels of these chariots in order <br />  to <br />        attain salvation. Such a description can also be found in <br />the <br />      popular <br />        fourteenth-century work "The Travels of Sir John <br />Mandeville." <br />    The <br />        fact is that devotees have sometimes been crushed <br />accidentally <br />    in <br />      the <br />        past as the massive 45 foot tall, multi-ton chariot slipped <br />  out <br />    of <br />        control. Many have also been killed in the resulting <br />  stampedes. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi,</p>
<p>  1) Now - we are looking at two the'rs - the correct word to be <br />used <br />  for the ones used by our gods ( and kings - ok kings were gods <br />those <br />  days) would be ratham - horse drawn chariots. I dont think our <br />  temple carts resemble chariots in any way..</p>
<p>  2) Also when you talk of large temple carts and the popular <br />  festivals - most of them seem to be linked with chola temples. <br />later <br />  day temples could have just continued based on their formula. </p>
<p>  3) I have seen a couple of contemporary temple carts being built - <br />  they are built with solid team beams - meaning the structure is <br />  mostly hollow ( to allow movement inside and to keep it light). </p>
<p>  4) We also know that these temple carts were usually plated with <br />  metal ( thanga theer - velli theer) - the wood is already <br />elaborate <br />  carved and it would have been easier to just paint them with <br />bright <br />  colors - why go through the rigmarole of painstakingly metal <br />plating <br />  the entire structure. </p>
<p>  5) Normally the back of the diety is not seen /shown ( for <br />obviously <br />  purposes) - you are not allowed to circumabulate the inside of <br />garba <br />  graham - you only do the outside. so why is the temple cart open <br />on <br />  all four sides?</p>
<p>  6) Ok, you build a tall structure with a high pedestal to display <br />  the idol. common sense would be to give it a flight of steps or <br />  atleast some padi/foothold/hand rail on the outside. Why is there <br />a <br />  complete absense of such tools to get up the theru on the ouside. <br />  Its almost immpossible to climb without assistance /external <br />ladder. <br />  Is it built to keep people out...</p>
<p>  If someone can look up any temple cart ( preferably old in their <br />  pristine condition) and post some snaps of the internal plan of <br />the <br />  base and the cone on top - we could see more..</p>

<p>      The term juggernaut is used to describe any literal or <br />  metaphorical <br />      force regarded as unstoppable that will crush all in its path. <br />  In <br />      Britain, it is also used to refer to any large and heavy lorry.</p>
<p>      The word is derived from the Sanskrit Jagann&#257;tha (meaning <br />    "Lord of <br />      the universe") which is one of the many names of Krishna from <br />  the <br />      ancient Vedic scriptures of India. <br />      One of the most famous of Indian temples is the Jagannath <br />Temple <br />  in <br />      Puri, Orissa, which has the Ratha Yatra (chariot procession), <br />an <br />      annual procession of chariots carrying the murtis/statues of <br />      Jagann⴨ (Krishna), Subhadra and Baladeva (Krishna's elder <br />    brother). </p>
<p>      its a case of mistaken identity. european visitors took the <br />ther <br />  to <br />      be jaganath</p>

        <p>"But technology might have moved from one use to another as spin off." Nice thought. I have some thoughts too. Maybe some king made a replica of his war machine and presented it to the temple to get the blessings of the lord (similar to human body part replicas given in some amman temples) to win his war. The other scenarios is he gave the replica or an actual war machine to the local temple after a successful war as a way of showing his gratification to the lord. As time passed his successors probably thought it ismandatory to present a replica of the war machine to a temple to win a warand it continued. </p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1) Now - we are looking at two the'rs - the correct word to be used <br />for the ones used by our gods ( and kings - ok kings were gods those <br />days) would be ratham - horse drawn chariots. I dont think our <br />temple carts resemble chariots in any way..</p>
<p>2) Also when you talk of large temple carts and the popular <br />festivals - most of them seem to be linked with chola temples. later <br />day temples could have just continued based on their formula. </p>
<p>3) I have seen a couple of contemporary temple carts being built - <br />they are built with solid team beams - meaning the structure is <br />mostly hollow ( to allow movement inside and to keep it light). </p>
<p>4) We also know that these temple carts were usually plated with <br />metal ( thanga theer - velli theer) - the wood is already elaborate <br />carved and it would have been easier to just paint them with bright <br />colors - why go through the rigmarole of painstakingly metal plating <br />the entire structure. </p>
<p>5) Normally the back of the diety is not seen /shown ( for obviously <br />purposes) - you are not allowed to circumabulate the inside of garba <br />graham - you only do the outside. so why is the temple cart open on <br />all four sides?</p>
<p>6) Ok, you build a tall structure with a high pedestal to display <br />the idol. common sense would be to give it a flight of steps or <br />atleast some padi/foothold/hand rail on the outside. Why is there a <br />complete absense of such tools to get up the theru on the ouside. <br />Its almost immpossible to climb without assistance /external ladder. <br />Is it built to keep people out...</p>
<p>If someone can look up any temple cart ( preferably old in their <br />pristine condition) and post some snaps of the internal plan of the <br />base and the cone on top - we could see more..</p>

<p>    The term juggernaut is used to describe any literal or <br />metaphorical <br />    force regarded as unstoppable that will crush all in its path. <br />In <br />    Britain, it is also used to refer to any large and heavy lorry.</p>
<p>    The word is derived from the Sanskrit Jagann&#257;tha (meaning <br />  "Lord of <br />    the universe") which is one of the many names of Krishna from <br />the <br />    ancient Vedic scriptures of India. <br />    One of the most famous of Indian temples is the Jagannath Temple <br />in <br />    Puri, Orissa, which has the Ratha Yatra (chariot procession), an <br />    annual procession of chariots carrying the murtis/statues of <br />    Jagann⴨ (Krishna), Subhadra and Baladeva (Krishna's elder <br />  brother). </p>
<p>    its a case of mistaken identity. european visitors took the ther <br />to <br />    be jaganath</p>
<p>    During the British colonial era, Christian missionaries <br />promulgated <br />  a <br />    fallacy that Hindu devotees of Krishna were lunatic fanatics who <br />    threw themselves under the wheels of these chariots in order to <br />    attain salvation. Such a description can also be found in the <br />  popular <br />    fourteenth-century work "The Travels of Sir John Mandeville." <br />The <br />    fact is that devotees have sometimes been crushed accidentally <br />in <br />  the <br />    past as the massive 45 foot tall, multi-ton chariot slipped out <br />of <br />    control. Many have also been killed in the resulting stampedes. </p>

<p>    hi look at it from this point of view:</p>
<p>    lets assume that the temple theru was built for the purpose of <br />    exhibiting the temple diety ( the utsavars) - </p>
<p>    1) i think it was only during late 9th century you come across <br />    utsava murthi's in temples - they were either pancha lokam or <br />    bronzes ( pl correct me if i am wrong) - and these were not big <br />at <br />    all. so why build something so massive to display these</p>
<p>    2) Normally the ther passes through the main through fares ( <br />  leading <br />    to the names theeradi veedhi etc) - we can presume that these <br />were <br />    good roads, if so how do you justify the enormous wheels - they <br />    would be more manageble with smaller wheels but more in number. <br />  were <br />    the larger wheels are needed to negotiate obstacles??</p>
<p>    3) If you looking at displaying an idol - you would normally <br />think <br />    of a platform with the idol being at the topmost point ( ok <br />  discount <br />    for a rain/sun shade on top) - then how do you explain the huge <br />    conical construction on top of the theeru. this infact obstructs <br />  the <br />    vision.</p>
<p>    4) in those days am sure the best you could have in terms of <br />houses <br />    were one addnl storey ( mettha veedu) - ok at best a balcony - <br />how <br />    do you justify these massive carts which tower over three/four <br />    floors.</p>
<p>    5) if you look at even later day movies ( incl lord of the rings) <br />  of <br />    depiction of battle siege scenes - you see the best form of <br />defense <br />    for those inside the sieged fort - are archers, stone throwers, <br />hot <br />    oil and inflammable material. Now envision our humble temple <br />theru <br />    as a seige tower - the conical top shields those inside from <br />    whatever is thrown from top + allows the thrown stuff to slide <br />off <br />    and not accumulate, so does the large wheel base. Greek accounts <br />  of <br />    similar towers talk of fire proofing these with animal hides <br />etc...</p>

        <p>-Hi</p>
<p>lots of our gods are connected with wars.so why not give them thers <br />also.</p>
<p>most hold weapons and are mounted on animals and birds</p>
<p>there are specific legends of gods riding 'ther' like shiva who went <br />to the thirupuram burning<br />( its notable his axle broke in acharapakkam( achu iru paakkam)<br />I feel thers were a part of rituals.</p>

<blockquote><p>  The term juggernaut is used to describe any literal or metaphorical <br />  force regarded as unstoppable that will crush all in its path. In <br />  Britain, it is also used to refer to any large and heavy lorry.</p>
<p>  The word is derived from the Sanskrit Jagann&#257;tha (meaning <br />"Lord of <br />  the universe") which is one of the many names of Krishna from the <br />  ancient Vedic scriptures of India. <br />  One of the most famous of Indian temples is the Jagannath Temple in <br />  Puri, Orissa, which has the Ratha Yatra (chariot procession), an <br />  annual procession of chariots carrying the murtis/statues of <br />  Jagann?th (Krishna), Subhadra and Baladeva (Krishna's elder <br />brother). </p>
<p>  its a case of mistaken identity. european visitors took the ther to <br />  be jaganath</p>
<p>  During the British colonial era, Christian missionaries promulgated <br />a <br />  fallacy that Hindu devotees of Krishna were lunatic fanatics who <br />  threw themselves under the wheels of these chariots in order to <br />  attain salvation. Such a description can also be found in the <br />popular <br />  fourteenth-century work "The Travels of Sir John Mandeville." The <br />  fact is that devotees have sometimes been crushed accidentally in <br />the <br />  past as the massive 45 foot tall, multi-ton chariot slipped out of <br />  control. Many have also been killed in the resulting stampedes. </p>

<p>lets assume that the temple theru was built for the purpose of <br />exhibiting the temple diety ( the utsavars) - </p>
<p>1) i think it was only during late 9th century you come across <br />utsava murthi's in temples - they were either pancha lokam or <br />bronzes ( pl correct me if i am wrong) - and these were not big at <br />all. so why build something so massive to display these</p>
<p>2) Normally the ther passes through the main through fares ( leading <br />to the names theeradi veedhi etc) - we can presume that these were <br />good roads, if so how do you justify the enormous wheels - they <br />would be more manageble with smaller wheels but more in number. were <br />the larger wheels are needed to negotiate obstacles??</p>
<p>3) If you looking at displaying an idol - you would normally think <br />of a platform with the idol being at the topmost point ( ok discount <br />for a rain/sun shade on top) - then how do you explain the huge <br />conical construction on top of the theeru. this infact obstructs the <br />vision.</p>
<p>4) in those days am sure the best you could have in terms of houses <br />were one addnl storey ( mettha veedu) - ok at best a balcony - how <br />do you justify these massive carts which tower over three/four <br />floors.</p>
<p>5) if you look at even later day movies ( incl lord of the rings) of <br />depiction of battle siege scenes - you see the best form of defense <br />for those inside the sieged fort - are archers, stone throwers, hot <br />oil and inflammable material. Now envision our humble temple theru <br />as a seige tower - the conical top shields those inside from <br />whatever is thrown from top + allows the thrown stuff to slide off <br />and not accumulate, so does the large wheel base. Greek accounts of <br />similar towers talk of fire proofing these with animal hides etc...</p>

The <br />  fact is that devotees have sometimes been crushed accidentally in <br />the <br />  past as the massive 45 foot tall, multi-ton chariot slipped out of <br />  control.

        <p>I will come back later to the point raised ..</p>
<p>but even the evolution from siege towers to temple theru or the other <br />way round does not explain the technology behind the massive theru.</p>
<p>What was used for the axle? Iron? When did they get iron/bronze ?</p>
<p>I am sure it is not a 19th/18th century innovation.</p>

<blockquote><p>  hi look at it from this point of view:</p>
<p>  lets assume that the temple theru was built for the purpose of <br />  exhibiting the temple diety ( the utsavars) - </p>
<p>  1) i think it was only during late 9th century you come across <br />  utsava murthi's in temples - they were either pancha lokam or <br />  bronzes ( pl correct me if i am wrong) - and these were not big at <br />  all. so why build something so massive to display these</p>
<p>  2) Normally the ther passes through the main through fares ( <br />leading <br />  to the names theeradi veedhi etc) - we can presume that these were <br />  good roads, if so how do you justify the enormous wheels - they <br />  would be more manageble with smaller wheels but more in number. <br />were <br />  the larger wheels are needed to negotiate obstacles??</p>
<p>  3) If you looking at displaying an idol - you would normally think <br />  of a platform with the idol being at the topmost point ( ok <br />discount <br />  for a rain/sun shade on top) - then how do you explain the huge <br />  conical construction on top of the theeru. this infact obstructs <br />the <br />  vision.</p>
<p>  4) in those days am sure the best you could have in terms of houses <br />  were one addnl storey ( mettha veedu) - ok at best a balcony - how <br />  do you justify these massive carts which tower over three/four <br />  floors.</p>
<p>  5) if you look at even later day movies ( incl lord of the rings) <br />of <br />  depiction of battle siege scenes - you see the best form of defense <br />  for those inside the sieged fort - are archers, stone throwers, hot <br />  oil and inflammable material. Now envision our humble temple theru <br />  as a seige tower - the conical top shields those inside from <br />  whatever is thrown from top + allows the thrown stuff to slide off <br />  and not accumulate, so does the large wheel base. Greek accounts <br />of <br />  similar towers talk of fire proofing these with animal hides etc...</p>

          Kovil Theru .....was it a war machine        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>hi look at it from this point of view:</p>
<p>lets assume that the temple theru was built for the purpose of <br />exhibiting the temple diety ( the utsavars) - </p>
<p>1) i think it was only during late 9th century you come across <br />utsava murthi's in temples - they were either pancha lokam or <br />bronzes ( pl correct me if i am wrong) - and these were not big at <br />all. so why build something so massive to display these</p>
<p>2) Normally the ther passes through the main through fares ( leading <br />to the names theeradi veedhi etc) - we can presume that these were <br />good roads, if so how do you justify the enormous wheels - they <br />would be more manageble with smaller wheels but more in number. were <br />the larger wheels are needed to negotiate obstacles??</p>
<p>3) If you looking at displaying an idol - you would normally think <br />of a platform with the idol being at the topmost point ( ok discount <br />for a rain/sun shade on top) - then how do you explain the huge <br />conical construction on top of the theeru. this infact obstructs the <br />vision.</p>
<p>4) in those days am sure the best you could have in terms of houses <br />were one addnl storey ( mettha veedu) - ok at best a balcony - how <br />do you justify these massive carts which tower over three/four <br />floors.</p>
<p>5) if you look at even later day movies ( incl lord of the rings) of <br />depiction of battle siege scenes - you see the best form of defense <br />for those inside the sieged fort - are archers, stone throwers, hot <br />oil and inflammable material. Now envision our humble temple theru <br />as a seige tower - the conical top shields those inside from <br />whatever is thrown from top + allows the thrown stuff to slide off <br />and not accumulate, so does the large wheel base. Greek accounts of <br />similar towers talk of fire proofing these with animal hides etc...</p>

        <p>Hi<br />It costs around 3-7 lakhs to have a ball bearing supported axle for a <br />temple ther depending on the size of the ther it was first initiated <br />by <acronym title="Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited" BHEL</acronym  and a lot of temples have these systems.</p>
<p>But more than the technology its the lack of pullers that dissuades <br />a lot of temple management.<br />I have observed that in Kalyar koil its a hoiday for the schols and <br />local textile establishments, mainly for people to come over and pull <br />the ther.</p>

<p>    A siege tower (or in the Middle Ages a belfry[1]) is a <br />specialized <br />    siege engine, constructed to protect assailants and ladders <br />while <br />    approaching the defensive walls of a fortification. The tower <br />was <br />    often rectangular with four wheels and a height roughly equal to <br />    that of the wall or sometimes higher to allow archers to stand <br />on <br />    top of the tower and fire into the fortification. Because the <br />  towers <br />    were wooden and thus flammable, they had to have some non-<br />flammable <br />    covering of iron or fresh animal skins.[1] The siege tower was <br />    mainly made from wood but sometimes they had metal parts.</p>
<p>    Used since the 9th century BC in the ancient Near East, 305 BC <br />in <br />    Europe and also in antiquity in the Far East, siege towers were <br />of <br />    unwieldy dimensions and, like trebuchets, were therefore mostly <br />    constructed on site of the siege. Taking considerable time to <br />    construct, siege towers were mainly built if the defense of the <br />    opposing fortification could not be overcome by ladder assault, <br />by <br />    sapping or by breaking walls or gates.</p>
<p>    The siege tower sometimes housed pikemen, swordsmen, or <br />crossbowmen <br />    who shot quarrels at the defenders. Because of the size of the <br />  tower <br />    it would often be the first target of large stone catapults but <br />it <br />    had its own projectiles to fight back with.[1]</p>

<p>    Literally, “destroyer of cities;” the name given to an engine <br />    invented by Demetrius Poliorcetes (q. v.) for besieging <br />fortified <br />    places, consisting of a square tower placed upon wheels, and run <br />up <br />    to the height of nine stories, each of which was furnished with <br />    machines for battering and discharging projectiles of enormous <br />size <br />    and weight </p>

<p>  A siege tower (or in the Middle Ages a belfry[1]) is a specialized <br />  siege engine, constructed to protect assailants and ladders while <br />  approaching the defensive walls of a fortification. The tower was <br />  often rectangular with four wheels and a height roughly equal to <br />  that of the wall or sometimes higher to allow archers to stand on <br />  top of the tower and fire into the fortification. Because the <br />towers <br />  were wooden and thus flammable, they had to have some non-flammable <br />  covering of iron or fresh animal skins.[1] The siege tower was <br />  mainly made from wood but sometimes they had metal parts.</p>
<p>  Used since the 9th century BC in the ancient Near East, 305 BC in <br />  Europe and also in antiquity in the Far East, siege towers were of <br />  unwieldy dimensions and, like trebuchets, were therefore mostly <br />  constructed on site of the siege. Taking considerable time to <br />  construct, siege towers were mainly built if the defense of the <br />  opposing fortification could not be overcome by ladder assault, by <br />  sapping or by breaking walls or gates.</p>
<p>  The siege tower sometimes housed pikemen, swordsmen, or crossbowmen <br />  who shot quarrels at the defenders. Because of the size of the <br />tower <br />  it would often be the first target of large stone catapults but it <br />  had its own projectiles to fight back with.[1]</p>
