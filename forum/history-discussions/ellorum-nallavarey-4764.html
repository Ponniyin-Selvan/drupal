<p>Sirpi Balasubramaniam Iyya avargal</p>
<p>source The Hindu<br />Treading Bharati's path Sahitya Akademi award winner Sirpi Balasubramaniam reflects on his works and shares his views on poetry and literature in a t?te-?-t?te with M. ALLIRAJAN. <br />IT IS not often that one comes across people who remember their inspiration and speak fondly about them long after they become popular. Sirpi Balasubramaniam is one such person. An avid fan of Subramaniya Bharati, he took to writing poems, inspired by the works of the legend. That inspiration, which turned into a passion, has taken him to great heights. Sirpi who has been conferred with the prestigious Sahitya Akademi award twice in two years, says that even now he cannot spend a day without reading Bharathiar's poems. "For me, his writing is scripture and every word of his law," he states. "Sirpi" is a man of many faces&#151; a translator, an academician and a literary journalist. He won his second Akademi award for his poem "Oru Gramathu Nadhi" in 2002. The work revolves around Sirpi's village Athupollachi, situated on the banks of Aliyar river near Pollachi. "The poem portrays life in my village and my memories about the place. Urban life is the same anywhere<br />in the world and one faces the same kind of problems in all cities and towns. But, life in an Indian village is very different." Does Sirpi's village represent the common Indian rural community? "It has some features which are seen in any village in the country. After moving out of my village, I used to go there once in a while. Unfortunately, rich rural customs, traditions and values are fast disappearing. The poem goes to the roots to reflect on the pristine past." "Azhigira gramathu panpadu pizhigirathu manadhai", (The dying village culture wrings my heart) Sirpi wrote in his foreword. And, he regrets that Western ideas find place in Indian literary works. "Some are copying the West without realising that our way of life is a lot different. You cannot have characters that are alien to our culture in our novels and poems. In India, we have a village life and our problems are peculiar". He says that R. K. Narayan's "Malgudi Days" became popular as it<br />realistically depicted life in a South Indian village. "It was appreciated even by western scholars," he points out. "I have tried to highlight the real problems of society in all my works from the very beginning. Contemporary life also provides ample scope for narration and I depict them by adding an artistic touch. Otherwise people won't read." What according to him is good poetry? "Poetry should reflect the society of our times. Over the years, it has been told in different forms. The impact of Bharathiar's poems cannot be brought out even in an article running to ten pages." People now have little time to read and so poetry thrives in shorter forms like Haiku. Short literary pieces are nothing new to Tamil, he avers. "The Tirukkural contains only couplets. Traditionally, there has been a place for such things in Tamil literature." Haiku is not a modern form and has been in existence for over 500 years. "There is a clear set of guidelines for<br />writing Haiku. However, a poem must not be constricted beyond a certain point", he states. Sirpi, who won the Sahitya Akademi award in 2001 for translating Lalithambika Antharjanam's "Agnisakshi" in Tamil, believes that "translation enriches the language into which a work is translated. Translating literary works into other languages is now needed more than ever before. It helps one society learn about the other and to know the developments in the literary field." "To translate, one must have sound knowledge of the language in which the original work is written. One should delve deep into the language and only a poet can do that. As I studied Malayalam till higher secondary, I could translate the works of Malayali poets," he says. What does he think about the present generation Tamil writers? "There are a lot of promising writers and a large number of women has also started writing novels and poems. The voice of feminists and issues Dalits and<br />issues pertaining to them are being heard louder than ever before." Sirpi asserts that they cannot remain on the fringes for long. "It will take some time for them to stabilise. But they will have to come to the mainstream," he feels. Ask him about film lyrics and he says tersely: "Though there is a poetic touch, lyrics in cinema cannot be called literary pieces. There is very little space in cinema for a poets' creative talents." "There may be some exceptions. But, these lyrics are written to suit a particular trend. How can one call them the product of the poet?" he asks. He changes his theme every time and this, he says, is a conscious decision. "There is no point in writing about the same thing over and over again." Does he plan to try out prose? "Poetry is like a flash. I have told stories in pudhukavidhai. But, one should not express emotions in prose. A novelist does not give vent to his emotions. I am still trying to learn that. Once I get a grip<br />on it, I plan to write a novel." Sirpi served as the Head of the Department of Tamil, Bharathiar University and was one of the pioneers of the "Vaanambadi" poetry movement, which made even commoners read poems. "The movement was started by Tamil lecturers. Traditionalists came out and started writing pudhukavidhai. It created a big readership base even in countries like Malaysia and Singapore," he reminisces. How did he manage to combine the roles of an academician and litterateur? "The passion for writing and the creative instinct kept me going. I wrote Poojayangalin Sangili in just two nights while it took me seven days to complete Bharathi Kaithi En 203." Though he has written many poems, his latest work on Bharathiar is the one that has been the most satisfying, he says. <br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Wonderful article by Dr.Jayabharthy Iyya on Palur Port<br />Moderator of agastier group.vetern in yahoo groups </p>
<p>KELING</p>
<p>BY<br />DR.S.JAYABARATHI</p>
<p>In the ancient times and until the ninteenth century, the shipping traffic between India and South East Asia and the Far East, depended very much on the monsoon winds.</p>
<p>In those days(around 800 years ago) the ports and harbours in the Indian seaboard of the Bay of Bengal were many. Among them, the important ones were KoRkai, Kaayal alias KIlzakkarai, PauthiramaNikkapattinam or Vahudhapuri, AlzaganKuLam, ThoNdi, Nagappattinam, Pumpuhar, Thirumalairayan Pattinam, Pugai, KatalMallai, Mayilai, Mimisal, Palur, Kalinggappattinam, and several others. </p>
<p>Among these Palur in Kalinga was the nearest and was in astraight line from SE Asia. The direction of the Monsoon winds were optimum in Palur. Moreover, the sea currents were also very favourable. Therefore, this was the most suitable place for a very fast and safe journey .</p>
<p>There was a undersea current which ran from the mouth of the Godavari River to North Sumatra and South Thailand. </p>
<p>To get the maximum benefit from the South West Monsoon and North East Monsoon, the best ports were situated in Kalinga. <br />These port cities and markets served all the countries which bordered on Kalinga. Not only them, but also the countries which were adjacent to them and beyond. <br />Great kingdoms and empires like the Vakatakas, Chalukyas, Western Chalukyas, Andras, Chodas, Malavas, Paramara Bhojas, and others, these ports were the flowing points.</p>
<p>There was also another reason. <br />Several Kalingan royal dynasties fitted out great expeditions with numerous huge ships with their subject people and colonised many places in South East Asia and Ceylon. The royal houses of Sinhala and the Kalinga dynasty of Java were founded by these people. </p>
<p>In the ancient times, among the people who came from India, the Andras, Kalingas, Bengalis, and Tamils were predominant. Among these, the Kalingas came in large numbers. </p>
<p>People from interior areas like Deccan, Esatern Maraththa and Kannada prefered to travel from Palur and Kalingapattinam. <br />Therefore, these ports of Kalinga had the most amount of traffic and also had the most amount of trade and were of maximum economic importance. </p>
<p>Since the majority of ships were coming from Kalinga, and the travellers, even though of other nationalities embarked and arrived from Kalinga, the people of South East Asia addressed everyone as Kalingans. </p>
<p>In the Malay language, the name 'Keling' which is a derivative of Kalinga, became the common name for all Indians. The Chinese call them as 'Kleynga' They usually add a suffix 'Ki' which means 'devil'. </p>
<p>The ancient Chinese used to call the Kalingas as Kaleynga and the Tamils as Chu-lien. Chu-lien is derived from Cholzia - a native of Cholza Desa. Now the word has become Chulia and is used to denote the Tamil Muslims. </p>
<p>Six hundered years ago, the Bengalis were differentiated from the others. They were addressed as 'Banggali'. Now the name is used to denote anyone from North India. The Punjabi Sikhs are called as Banggali. Even the Tamils call them as 'Seekku VanggaaLi'. The Sikhs came to be called by such a name because they would come all the way from Punjab to Calcutta and take the ships to South East Asia. </p>
<p>When the Portugues first came to Malaya, they were called as Banggali Puteh - 'The White Bengalis'. Later on the mistake was realised and they were called by the name 'Ferringgi' which is a derivative of the word 'Frank'. </p>
<p>Because of the impact that the Frankish Empire had upon the ancient Western world, the name Frank became famous and stuck until the Italians, Porutuguese, Spanish, etc., came to be called by that name.</p>
<p>The advent ot the Kalingas stopped about six hundred years ago. </p>
<p>But the Tamils were still coming and going. However, the name Keling stuck to them. Every town had its own quarter where the Tamils lived. These were known as Pekan Keling, Kampong Keling, and Tanjong Keling.</p>
<p>During the times of the Malaccan Empire, the Tamil merchants lived there in glory with great richness and influence. The Portuguese travellers have written much about them. They address those merchants as Chiitis. </p>
<p>This is a derivative of the Tamil word Chetti. They also called them as Kelings or Quelins. They say that the part of the city of Malacca where the Chiities lived, was bigger, better, more beautiful, and more prosperous than the rest of Malacca. That particular part still exists as 'Tanjong Keling'.</p>
<p>Castanheda was aPortuguese traveller who lived in Malacca during its heyday - 1528 to 1538. He has written about the Kelings.</p>
<p>Castanheda:<br />"In the northern part of the city, live merchants known as Quelins(Kling, the people of Kalinga, from India); In this part, the town is much larger than at any other. There are at Malacca many foreign merchants, who I said before live among themselves. They are moors and pagans. The pagans come principally from Paleacate; they are installed permanently. They are very rich. They are the greatest merchants of the world at thisperiod".</p>
<p>"They evaluate their wealth only in Bahars of gold.; there are some possessing 60 quintals of gold( 1 quintal = 700 kilograms). They do not consider as rich, the merchant who, in a single day, does not buy three or four ships charged with merchandises of grear value, and make them reload(the ships) and pay them their proper amounts.</p>
<p>Thus, this port is the most important in the world and has the richest merchandise known to the whole world".</p>
<p>Castanheda says that they are from Paleakat. PaLaiyakat is a region of Thondai Mandalam which is made up of the south eastern districts of Andra and the north eastern districts of Tamilnadu. It also includes Cholza land. In later times, this was called as Palekat or Pulikat. </p>
<p>The Chulias came to be refered to as Plekat person by the Malays. Special types of sarongs, white cloth and such like items were imported from Palekat. So much so that the sarngs came to called as Pulicat or Paleikat.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Castanheda refers to Non Muslim and Non Christian merchants as Kelings.</p>
<p>There is a big mosque which was built by the Tamil Muslims. It is called the Kapitan Keling Mosque. Kapitan Keling was the name of an officer designated by the Sultan. This officer was the leader of the Kelings and was in-charge of their affairs. This mosque is in Chulia Street. Chulia stand for the Tamil Muslims. It was originally Cholzia and became Malayised into Chulia.</p>
<p>One thousand years ago, when the hegemony of the Cholzas was there, the Tamils were known as the Chulia or Chu lien. </p>
<p>But at a later time, this name came to be applied to only the Tamil Muslim merchants from the region around Nagapattinam. </p>
<p>Now that name is also out-of use. They call them as 'Mamak.</p>
<p>At present, the name Keling stands for Non-Muslim Tamils.</p>
<p>Keling is used in a derogatory manner in Malaysia. But in Indonesia no such bad stigma is attached. It is just a name. </p>
