        <p>Dear All</p>
<p>Everybody has viewpoints and arguments let's not hurt each other..</p>
<p>I think someone was tempting fate by commenting how civil our forum was not<br />long ago.</p>

<p>Rahul, if anyone ha an opinion there will be counter opinion. It is wholly<br />unfair to dub counter opinions as kutram kandu...whatever . I must confess<br />also that I have noticed grouping of people - probably members who have<br />known one another as friends and one lines up supporting <br />anoother, one person even took offence and left a while ago. If we connot<br />hav counter opinions this is only a news group not a healthy discussion<br />board and it may very well be so no harm. But to allow only some people to<br />have opinions and others to read is imbalanced. that is all.</p>

<p>     Dear Sampath, </p>
<p>       What will be our stand if a movie on Veerappan's exploits is <br />  named <br />       "Ponniyin Selvan", the hero of 1500 members of this august <br />  group? <br />       Veerappan has also drank Kaveri water. </p>
<p>       Sampath </p>
<p>     Please note that there is atleast a connection to the count when <br />     Kamal titled it Dasavatharam. Also I did not find anything <br />     derogatory in terming it so. On the contrary I feel that your <br />  above <br />     example is a little far fetched. Definitely Veerappan cannot be <br />     termed Ponniyin Selvan and you know this. So there "will" be <br />     heartburns definitely. </p>
<p>     On the contrary, rather than worrying about the title being <br />     Dasavatharam (of course it was not in a derogatory sense), if one <br />   is <br />     interested in the proper representation of the religious symbols, <br />  I <br />     feel that we need to take up the case of the Comedians making fun <br />   of <br />     the "thiruneeru" and "thiruman" and any other such religious <br />     symbols. I see that these are used in a more derogatory sense in <br />     movies than being titled Dasavatharam. </p>
<p>     So my humble opinion is let us not lose the focus on real <br />  problems, <br />     by looking at something that, in reality, is not a problem at <br />  all, <br />     considering the derogatory remarks, </p>

<p>  Also as you rightly pointed out, as long as we do not do anything to<br />  get rid of the "englishized" usage of avatar, why should we be making<br />  a mountain out of a mole hill here?</p>
<p>  I am really sorry, if my comment looks like rubbing on the wrong<br />  side. But my intention is to say that there are much more serious<br />  defamations going on and we are not protesting it, then why only this?</p>
<p>  Hope you get my point and sorry if my words have hurt you.</p>

<p>      Dear Sampath,</p>
<p>        What will be our stand if a movie on Veerappan's exploits is<br />  named<br />        "Ponniyin Selvan", the hero of 1500 members of this august<br />  group?<br />        Veerappan has also drank Kaveri water.</p>
<p>        Sampath</p>
<p>      Please note that there is atleast a connection to the count when<br />      Kamal titled it Dasavatharam. Also I did not find anything<br />      derogatory in terming it so. On the contrary I feel that your<br />  above<br />      example is a little far fetched. Definitely Veerappan cannot be<br />      termed Ponniyin Selvan and you know this. So there "will" be<br />      heartburns definitely.</p>
<p>      On the contrary, rather than worrying about the title being<br />      Dasavatharam (of course it was not in a derogatory sense), if one<br />    is<br />      interested in the proper representation of the religious symbols,<br />  I<br />      feel that we need to take up the case of the Comedians making fun<br />    of<br />      the "thiruneeru" and "thiruman" and any other such religious<br />      symbols. I see that these are used in a more derogatory sense in<br />      movies than being titled Dasavatharam.</p>
<p>      So my humble opinion is let us not lose the focus on real<br />  problems,<br />      by looking at something that, in reality, is not a problem at<br />  all,<br />      considering the derogatory remarks,</p>

          Kamal Haasan Dasavatharam Movie Review, Facts and Fiction        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sampath,</p>
<blockquote><p>  What will be our stand if a movie on Veerappan's exploits is named<br />  "Ponniyin Selvan", the hero of 1500 members of this august group?<br />  Veerappan has also drank Kaveri water.</p>
<p>  Sampath</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Please note that there is atleast a connection to the count when <br />Kamal titled it Dasavatharam. Also I did not find anything <br />derogatory in terming it so. On the contrary I feel that your above <br />example is a little far fetched. Definitely Veerappan cannot be <br />termed Ponniyin Selvan and you know this. So there "will" be <br />heartburns definitely.</p>
<p>On the contrary, rather than worrying about the title being <br />Dasavatharam (of course it was not in a derogatory sense), if one is <br />interested in the proper representation of the religious symbols, I <br />feel that we need to take up the case of the Comedians making fun of <br />the "thiruneeru" and "thiruman" and any other such religious <br />symbols. I see that these are used in a more derogatory sense in <br />movies than being titled Dasavatharam.</p>
<p>So my humble opinion is let us not lose the focus on real problems, <br />by looking at something that, in reality, is not a problem at all, <br />considering the derogatory remarks,</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

          Kamal Haasan Dasavatharam Movie Review, Facts and Fiction        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>The movie is alright, with a right masala of action, comedy, romance and<br />visual effects. The film and Kamal may get national awards, if political<br />conditions are favourable in future.</p>
<p>There are more dialogues supporting theism than atheism; it is really<br />funny that some went to court to stop release of the movie without even<br />seeing it. This is nothing new, as all those who oppose supposedly<br />controversial books, films or articles never get acquainted with the<br />originals. The whole scene was dignified and impressive, with majority<br />of the local population observing a pained silence during the last<br />procession to immersion (except a couple of stray incidents).</p>
<p>My cribbing is about the title; Dasavataram has a definite connotation<br />and meaning and it must not be indiscriminately used to denote anything<br />adding up to ten. Of course it is anyone's guess what will be the<br />reaction if movies are named after holy symbols of other religions.</p>
<p>A yet to be made film starring Napolean is named as "Pallkondapuram".<br />The author Mr. Padmanabhan, who got the Sahitya Academy award in 1970<br />for the novel "Pallikondapuram" has objected to the use of the novel's<br />title for the film and has sent a legal notice.</p>
<p>What will be our stand if a movie on Veerappan's exploits is named<br />"Ponniyin Selvan", the hero of 1500 members of this august group?<br />Veerappan has also drank Kaveri water.</p>

        <p>If you feel like try something. Write a long email.Follow up with several others. Go back and ask someone what you wrote on first. But who knows, you may remember. Vada prarivada happens in enclosed sessions and are very focused. This is just email exhange with some cross points. I give up , absolutely no hassles for me. My lesson is never to write more than 1 or 2 emails on any thread. Honesly I don&#39;t care about win or lose more if what I said went across. This case clearly it did not. I only wish the subject was something more worthy than a movie.<br />please let us give the group a break, since I apologized I hpe it will stop. thanks.</p>

        <p>Satish, I regard this as a classic case of an email debate..not just me rarely people read every word and syllable we write, it is usually the subjectpredominantly that sticks in people's minds.<br />?<br />I may not have read your first post, my comments predominantly have been onKamal, much less on the movie since I did not see it. If I remember right one other person said so too, yours have been on the lines of Kamal not getting credit, this that (more on the person, less on the movie). Perhaps that is really why I ended up talking more to you, and less to others!!<br />?<br />Regardless it is always a good idea for all of us to keep revisiting our communication skills.<br />?<br />Want to rest this issue for now.

<p>Malathy,</p>
<p>Did you ever read all my mails? In the very first few mails I did say<br />what are all the things that was not good in that movie. Almost in<br />similar lines with others.....but I am questioning my communications<br />skills now....am i not clear in what I am conveying... or is it that<br />you reply to mails without reading (like commenting on the movie<br />without watching :) ) just kidding..</p>

        <p>Malathy,</p>
<p>Did you ever read all my mails? In the very first few mails I did say<br />what are all the things that was not good in that movie. Almost in<br />similar lines with others.....but I am questioning my communications<br />skills now....am i not clear in what I am conveying...or is it that<br />you reply to mails without reading (like commenting on the movie<br />without watching :) ) just kidding..</p>

        <p>Satish,??What made your emails look like 'promos' atleast to me, was that it seemed to think highly of kamal than the movie, unlike Muthu or some others who pointed out obvous flaws in his approach even though they liked the movie.?Kamal is not some pathetic dude in need of credit he has made his millions and will survive regardless of whether peopel like his movie or not.<br />?<br />What you said on <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym , what brought us together is our love for <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and its author with all its ottais. So whether we critque or not we like someting about Kalki that is all. Perhaps a kamal rasigar mandram would feel same abouthis work but unfortunately we are not that.<br />?<br />Lastly if you comment on movies you watch being 'good' that is purely a personal thing. My taste appeals to friends and people I know that is all,neednot be to all.<br />?<br />Anyway nothing personal on my side. Sorry if your feelings were hurt in anyway.<br />?<br />Malathi<br />?<br />?</acronym></p>

        <p>Satish, the amount of publiicity some movies get make it unnecessary to seethem. I was and still am a big fan of kamal with regards to his acting andtalent as Muthu said. Of late his dabbling in subjects too big for him turns me off. I also feel omewhat sad and amused people trying to reduce hardwork of scientists to something this fellow used in his movie. Learning big cocepts is hard work, not entertainment . In any case what people like and do not like is thir choice ultmately, your effort to understand why they do not like seems &#39;over&#39; to me too.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi All,<br />The form of screenplay technique used in the movie is by itself an example<br />of Chaos, The technique is what is reffered to as Non Linear Screenplay,<br />Sujatha (aka Rangarajan) had written about this in one of the kelvi pathil<br />in KP in 2006.<br />The ability to correlate Chaos to most of our life is by itself a challenge<br />and an art</p>
<p>I had an opportunity to be present in one of the discussions of ponnin<br />selvan, when they were trying to use movie magic to write its screenplay,<br />thought that was a great example of chaos!!</p>
<p>Another friend in this group had written about intellectual and pseudo<br />intellectual stuff, being a thalivars fan (and having seen every single<br />movie from mannan till sivaji and hopefully kuselan too, on the first day),<br />it is vasishtar vayal brahma rishi when i say that Dashavataram is a good<br />movie.</p>
<p>When one goes to a rich buffet it is not neccessary to eat every single item<br />there, you eat what you like? or rather when you go to a gold mine , the one<br />who uses a shovel to dig will get the shovels quanity of gold, the one who<br />uses a spoon will get the spoons quanityt and one who uses the nail will get<br />the nails quanity of gold.</p>
<p>My 2 cents!</p>

<p>Butterfly effect,in essence, means that small variables in the <br />intial state of a system can result in calamities/unexpect ed results <br />during a later stage. We, project managers, are hammered this on <br />regular basis to catch up with the issues/defects at the start of <br />the project else pay the price during delivery. <br />But I think for all the pseudo-intellectual explanation, I dont <br />think Dasavatharam is a 'butterfly effect' movie. Its just a plain <br />thriller that is executed well. I would think '12B' as a butterfly <br />effect movie (which is a copy of 'Sliding doors') which diverges at <br />an earlier point and a seemingly innocous decision to board a bus <br />results in drastically different results.<br />To connect the first 20 minutes of the movie (which BTW is the <br />brilliant part of the entire movie) with the rest, the mail says this<br />"Kamal does tell to Asin in a dialogue that idol which gets sunken <br />back then gets struck between the tectonic plates under the sea and <br />causes tsunami"<br />May be I didn't hear it right when I watched it. But the above <br />sentence is the most, absolute BS that can be said and I believe <br />Kamal is not stupid enough to say such a thing. I mean, the writer <br />has no idea of tectonic plates or the subduction process that <br />creates a Tsunami. He/she assumes everyone to be the same and <br />postulates something that is nothing but horse crap.<br />I am not a Kamal fan (primarily because of the intolerable <br />intellectual pretense of his fans in presuming him to be something <br />other than what he is i.e a good actor and someone who works hard, <br />ref. 'ulaga nayagane' song, hubris, anyone?). <br />But I found the movie to be a neat entertainer and having some <br />interesting concepts, new to tamil cinema. No unnecessary songs, <br />biggest relief no Vivek or Vadivelu. I agreed with Jeyamohan's <br />review posted sometime before in this forum. Its just a pop-corn <br />movie and trying to paint it as something else is like trying to <br />understand aliens after watching the 'IJ and crystal skull'. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Very interesting post, thanks Satish. I have not seen<br />  this movie and so i do not choose to judge too much.<br />  But to my mind, you can fit any darn tamil movie into<br />  chaos theory!!! I mean reverse engineer the story to<br />  say this is related to that, you will get it. I have<br />  seen some fake spiritual gurus do the same with Karmic<br />  theories, i mean come up with hugely contrived<br />  explanations especially on puranic stories (eg Vali<br />  was someone in his first birth, Sri Rama was someone<br />  else they are balancing karma, this that).</p>
<p>  Kamal is a very smart guy, really he has introduced<br />  these big concepts like he is doing something great<br />  while telling a regular movie story. It does not hurt<br />  people to think, so I don't think that is anything<br />  wrong. It does take a Kamal however to make people<br />  think that these concepts can be pondered on with the<br />  aid of his movie!!</p>

<p>    Sorry to bring this topic again. As I said earlier,<br />    the movie is a<br />    milestone in Indian cinema and has a lot of<br />    philosophy in it. I didnt<br />    spell out everything that i was thinking about the<br />    movie.</p>

<p>    DASAVATHARAM FAQS - CHAOS THEORY AND BUTTERFLY<br />    EFFECT<br />    Kamal Haasan's ten roles in Dasavaratham</p>
<p>    Rangaraja Nambi (12th century Vaishnavite -- Buddha<br />    avatar??)<br />    Govindarajan Ramaswamy (bio technologist - Rama<br />    avatar??)<br />    George Bush (US President)<br />    Avtaar Singh (Punjabi singer)<br />    Christian Fletcher (US ex-CIA officer)<br />    Shinghen Narahasi (a Japanese martial arts expert -<br />    narasimha avatar??)<br />    Krishnaveni (95-year-old, mentally retarted woman -<br />    Vamana avatar??)<br />    Vincent Poovaraagan (a Dalit neglected by the<br />    society due to their<br />    caste - Krishna avatar?)<br />    Kalifullah Mukhtaar (8 feet tall innocent muslim -<br />    Kalki avatar??)<br />    Balram Naidu (Telugu intelligence officer -<br />    Parasuram avatar??)</p>
<p>    Here is the excellent explanation about Chaos theory<br />    and Butterfly<br />    message -</p>
<p>    FOR THOSE WHO LOVED Dasavatharam AND ALSO FOR THOSE<br />    WHO CUDNT<br />    UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT!!!!! !!!!!</p>
<p>    Too many doubts about correlation of the movie,<br />    Chaos theory and<br />    Butterfly Effect have come into Picture?.!!!</p>
<p>    The movie clearly states about Chaos Theory and<br />    Butterfly Effect<br />    [Kamal says it in his Speech in the Movie ]</p>
<p>    The concept of "CHAOS THEORY" and "BUTTERFLY<br />    EFFECT", by itself is a<br />    complex concept, which mainly highlights the<br />    happening of huge<br />    unimaginable things because of least probable<br />    things?!!!!</p>
<p>    Dasavatharam although deals with these concept, but<br />    does not<br />    necessarily confuse anyone with it,,,, As i said<br />    earlier, its mainly<br />    "YOU"? that plays a factor in how the movie gets<br />    along with "YOU".</p>
<p>    You have got to be Case 1 or Case 2 as i have said<br />    earlier in this<br />    entry,,, No use being Half Baked?..!!!!</p>
<p>    To just brief about these Concepts,</p>
<p>    Q: What is Chaotic System ?<br />    A: Basically a chaotic system is one wherein long<br />    term predictions are<br />    impossible.Like for example,if I push a car, I know<br />    that it is going<br />    to move and it will continue to do so if I go on<br />    pushing it on and<br />    on.However,in a chaotic system,this situation cannot<br />    be predicted over<br />    a long period of time.<br />    Weather for example is a chaotic system.No matter<br />    how good your<br />    instruments are,you simply cannot predict the<br />    weather with 100%<br />    accuracy over a long term basis and forecast it.</p>
<p>    Q: What is the Butterfly Effect ?Matsyavatara<br />    A: It is the most important component of a chaotic<br />    system.Basically, small perturbations results in<br />    amplifications which<br />    completely destroys the original nature of the<br />    system and makes<br />    prediction impossible.<br />    If a butterfly flaps its wings in Africa,it could<br />    result in a cyclone<br />    in USA.(Mark the word COULD).A highly dumbed down<br />    explanation of the<br />    butterfly effect is in the film Anniyan,where<br />    Vikram's sister dies<br />    because a liquor shop owner sells liquor on a dry<br />    day.</p>
<p>    Q: OK, how does Dasavatharam incorporate it ?<br />    A: In essence,Dasavathara m talks about 8 characters<br />    who are<br />    inconsequential as such,but are integrated in a<br />    larger picture.Without<br />    Bush,the plane would have been called back.Without<br />    Shinghen, Govind<br />    would be dead.Without the tsunami,the world would<br />    have been<br />    destroyed.Even Krishnaveni Patti plays a very<br />    important role.If she<br />    had not put the vial in the idol,maybe Govind would<br />    have recovered it<br />    then and there and a powerful weapon would have been<br />    unleashed.The<br />    very fact that it went into the idol meant that it<br />    was being<br />    accelerated to its destiny.Without Kaifulla Khan,<br />    Govind would have<br />    never escaped;the list simply goes on.</p>
<p>    Q:OK,so does the film talk about theism or atheism?<br />    A:Neither.It talks about how humans drive the<br />    destiny of the world.</p>
<p>    The idol that is drowned in the sea along with<br />    Rangarajan in 12th<br />    century by Chozha king results in a fault being<br />    developed at the<br />    bottom of the ocean and creates tremors more than<br />    800 years later.<br />    These tremors result in the Tsunami. This again is a<br />    classic case of<br />    Butterfly Effect wherein a seemingly inconsequential<br />    event (the<br />    drowning of the idol) saves Tamil Nadu from being<br />    wiped off the face<br />    of the earth.</p>
<p>    The 1st scene is perfectly connected to the climax,<br />    remember what<br />    Kamal says in the first scene, that he will not say<br />    "Om Nama Shivaya"<br />    , but Asin tells him to chant it , but still Kamal<br />    refuses , ( in this<br />    kamal in his story tries to tell that ) Nambi<br />    believes in his god more<br />    than anything, but Asin feels "Its ok if we change<br />    the god or chant<br />    other god's name, its life thats most important."<br />    Now if u see the<br />    climax its JUST OPPOSITE?. Kamal doesn't believe in<br />    god much and<br />    values lives of people the most?. but Asin deeply<br />    believes in god and<br />    that too this dialogue comes when both Asin and<br />    Kamal's hand is on the<br />    god which came from the sea , and it also means that<br />    they are getting<br />    united from the place they departed hundreds of<br />    years back ( Kamal and<br />    Asin).The connection between the 1st scene and the<br />    climax in the movie<br />    shows the generation circle combined with<br />    supernatural powers of GOD<br />    and destiny?..!! !</p>
<p>    If you watch it closely u can also find another<br />    actor who has done<br />    double action other than Asin and Kamal.<br />    Asin's father Sahasranamam [12th Century], in the<br />    beginning he says to<br />    Nambi "Panchatchira manthirathai sollitu vaango<br />    mappillai" and at the<br />    End [After tsunami] he says "Avar enna jathiyo inga<br />    vaanga paati ".<br />    Another Eg. of Chaos Theory and circle of life.</p>
<p>    JUST IMAGINE THE CHAOS THEORY IN A TAMIL FILM ??<br />    WILL ANYONE HAVE THE GUTS TO HANDLE THIS KIND OF A<br />    SUBJECT IN A TAMIL<br />    FILM?</p>
<p>    ONLY KAMAL HAS THE GUTS?. U ROCK!!</p>

<p>    Q: What is Chaotic System ?<br />    A: Basically a chaotic system is one wherein long<br />    term predictions are<br />    impossible.Like for example,if I push a car, I know<br />    that it is going<br />    to move and it will continue to do so if I go on<br />    pushing it on and<br />    on.However,in a chaotic system,this situation cannot<br />    be predicted over<br />    a long period of time.<br />    Weather for example is a chaotic system.No matter<br />    how good your<br />    instruments are,you simply cannot predict the<br />    weather with 100%<br />    accuracy over a long term basis and forecast it.</p>
<p>    Q: What is the Butterfly Effect ?Matsyavatara<br />    A: It is the most important component of a chaotic<br />    system.Basically,small perturbations results in<br />    amplifications which<br />    completely destroys the original nature of the<br />    system and makes<br />    prediction impossible.<br />    If a butterfly flaps its wings in Africa,it could<br />    result in a cyclone<br />    in USA.(Mark the word COULD).A highly dumbed down<br />    explanation of the<br />    butterfly effect is in the film Anniyan,where<br />    Vikram's sister dies<br />    because a liquor shop owner sells liquor on a dry<br />    day.</p>
<p>    Q: OK, how does Dasavatharam incorporate it ?<br />    A: In essence,Dasavatharam talks about 8 characters<br />    who are<br />    inconsequential as such,but are integrated in a<br />    larger picture.Without<br />    Bush,the plane would have been called back.Without<br />    Shinghen, Govind<br />    would be dead.Without the tsunami,the world would<br />    have been<br />    destroyed.Even Krishnaveni Patti plays a very<br />    important role.If she<br />    had not put the vial in the idol,maybe Govind would<br />    have recovered it<br />    then and there and a powerful weapon would have been<br />    unleashed.The<br />    very fact that it went into the idol meant that it<br />    was being<br />    accelerated to its destiny.Without Kaifulla Khan,<br />    Govind would have<br />    never escaped;the list simply goes on.</p>
<p>    Q:OK,so does the film talk about theism or atheism?<br />    A:Neither.It talks about how humans drive the<br />    destiny of the world.</p>
<p>    The idol that is drowned in the sea along with<br />    Rangarajan in 12th<br />    century by Chozha king results in a fault being<br />    developed at the<br />    bottom of the ocean and creates tremors more than<br />    800 years later.<br />    These tremors result in the Tsunami. This again is a<br />    classic case of<br />    Butterfly Effect wherein a seemingly inconsequential<br />    event (the<br />    drowning of the idol) saves Tamil Nadu from being<br />    wiped off the face<br />    of the earth.</p>
<p>    The 1st scene is perfectly connected to the climax,<br />    remember what<br />    Kamal says in the first scene, that he will not say<br />    "Om Nama Shivaya"<br />    , but Asin tells him to chant it , but still Kamal<br />    refuses , ( in this<br />    kamal in his story tries to tell that ) Nambi<br />    believes in his god more<br />    than anything, but Asin feels "Its ok if we change<br />    the god or chant<br />    other god's name, its life thats most important."<br />    Now if u see the<br />    climax its JUST OPPOSITE?. Kamal doesn't believe in<br />    god much and<br />    values lives of people the most?. but Asin deeply<br />    believes in god and<br />    that too this dialogue comes when both Asin and<br />    Kamal's hand is on the<br />    god which came from the sea , and it also means that<br />    they are getting<br />    united from the place they departed hundreds of<br />    years back ( Kamal and<br />    Asin).The connection between the 1st scene and the<br />    climax in the movie<br />    shows the generation circle combined with<br />    supernatural powers of GOD<br />    and destiny?..!!!</p>
<p>    If you watch it closely u can also find another<br />    actor who has done<br />    double action other than Asin and Kamal.<br />    Asin's father Sahasranamam [12th Century], in the<br />    beginning he says to<br />    Nambi "Panchatchira manthirathai sollitu vaango<br />    mappillai" and at the<br />    End [After tsunami] he says "Avar enna jathiyo inga<br />    vaanga paati ".<br />    Another Eg. of Chaos Theory and circle of life.</p>
<p>    JUST IMAGINE THE CHAOS THEORY IN A TAMIL FILM ??<br />    WILL ANYONE HAVE THE GUTS TO HANDLE THIS KIND OF A<br />    SUBJECT IN A TAMIL<br />    FILM?</p>
<p>    ONLY KAMAL HAS THE GUTS?. U ROCK!!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Sorry to bring this topic again. As I said earlier,<br />  the movie is a<br />  milestone in Indian cinema and has a lot of<br />  philosophy in it. I didnt<br />  spell out everything that i was thinking about the<br />  movie.</p>
<p>  Today I stepped on this comment by someone in<br />  <a href="http://www.imdb.com" title="www.imdb.com">www.imdb.com</a><br />  (international movie database) and this reflects<br />  most of the things<br />  which I was thinking. </p>

<p>  DASAVATHARAM FAQS - CHAOS THEORY AND BUTTERFLY<br />  EFFECT<br />  Kamal Haasan's ten roles in Dasavaratham</p>
<p>  Rangaraja Nambi (12th century Vaishnavite -- Buddha<br />  avatar??)<br />  Govindarajan Ramaswamy (bio technologist - Rama<br />  avatar??)<br />  George Bush (US President)<br />  Avtaar Singh (Punjabi singer)<br />  Christian Fletcher (US ex-CIA officer)<br />  Shinghen Narahasi (a Japanese martial arts expert -<br />  narasimha avatar??)<br />  Krishnaveni (95-year-old, mentally retarted woman -<br />  Vamana avatar??)<br />  Vincent Poovaraagan (a Dalit neglected by the<br />  society due to their<br />  caste - Krishna avatar?)<br />  Kalifullah Mukhtaar (8 feet tall innocent muslim -<br />  Kalki avatar??)<br />  Balram Naidu (Telugu intelligence officer -<br />  Parasuram avatar??)</p>
<p>  Here is the excellent explanation about Chaos theory<br />  and Butterfly<br />  message -</p>
<p>  FOR THOSE WHO LOVED Dasavatharam AND ALSO FOR THOSE<br />  WHO CUDNT<br />  UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>  Too many doubts about correlation of the movie,<br />  Chaos theory and<br />  Butterfly Effect have come into Picture&#133;.!!!</p>
<p>  The movie clearly states about Chaos Theory and<br />  Butterfly Effect<br />  [Kamal says it in his Speech in the Movie ]</p>
<p>  The concept of "CHAOS THEORY" and "BUTTERFLY<br />  EFFECT", by itself is a<br />  complex concept, which mainly highlights the<br />  happening of huge<br />  unimaginable things because of least probable<br />  things&#133;!!!!</p>
<p>  Dasavatharam although deals with these concept, but<br />  does not<br />  necessarily confuse anyone with it,,,, As i said<br />  earlier, its mainly<br />  "YOU"&#133; that plays a factor in how the movie gets<br />  along with "YOU".</p>
<p>  You have got to be Case 1 or Case 2 as i have said<br />  earlier in this<br />  entry,,, No use being Half Baked&#133;..!!!!</p>

<p>  Q:OK,so does the film talk about theism or atheism?<br />  A:Neither.It talks about how humans drive the<br />  destiny of the world.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Sorry to bring this topic again. As I said earlier, the movie is a<br />milestone in Indian cinema and has a lot of philosophy in it. I didnt<br />spell out everything that i was thinking about the movie.</p>
<p>Today I stepped on this comment by someone in <a href="http://www.imdb.com" title="www.imdb.com">www.imdb.com</a><br />(international movie database) and this reflects most of the things<br />which I was thinking. </p>
<p>A good read... enjoy...</p>
<p>-------------------------------<br /><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479651/board/thread/109836253" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479651/board/thread/109836253">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479651/board/thread/109836253</a></p>
<p>DASAVATHARAM FAQS - CHAOS THEORY AND BUTTERFLY EFFECT<br />Kamal Haasan's ten roles in Dasavaratham</p>
<p>Rangaraja Nambi (12th century Vaishnavite -- Buddha avatar??)<br />Govindarajan Ramaswamy (bio technologist - Rama avatar??)<br />George Bush (US President)<br />Avtaar Singh (Punjabi singer)<br />Christian Fletcher (US ex-CIA officer)<br />Shinghen Narahasi (a Japanese martial arts expert - narasimha avatar??)<br />Krishnaveni (95-year-old, mentally retarted woman - Vamana avatar??)<br />Vincent Poovaraagan (a Dalit neglected by the society due to their<br />caste - Krishna avatar?)<br />Kalifullah Mukhtaar (8 feet tall innocent muslim - Kalki avatar??)<br />Balram Naidu (Telugu intelligence officer - Parasuram avatar??)</p>
<p>Here is the excellent explanation about Chaos theory and Butterfly</p>
<p>FOR THOSE WHO LOVED Dasavatharam AND ALSO FOR THOSE WHO CUDNT<br />UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Too many doubts about correlation of the movie, Chaos theory and<br />Butterfly Effect have come into Picture?.!!!</p>
<p>The movie clearly states about Chaos Theory and Butterfly Effect<br />[Kamal says it in his Speech in the Movie ]</p>
<p>The concept of "CHAOS THEORY" and "BUTTERFLY EFFECT", by itself is a<br />complex concept, which mainly highlights the happening of huge<br />unimaginable things because of least probable things?!!!!</p>
<p>Dasavatharam although deals with these concept, but does not<br />necessarily confuse anyone with it,,,, As i said earlier, its mainly<br />"YOU"? that plays a factor in how the movie gets along with "YOU".</p>
<p>You have got to be Case 1 or Case 2 as i have said earlier in this<br />entry,,, No use being Half Baked?..!!!!</p>
<p>To just brief about these Concepts,</p>
<p>Q: What is Chaotic System ?<br />A: Basically a chaotic system is one wherein long term predictions are<br />impossible.Like for example,if I push a car, I know that it is going<br />to move and it will continue to do so if I go on pushing it on and<br />on.However,in a chaotic system,this situation cannot be predicted over<br />a long period of time.<br />Weather for example is a chaotic system.No matter how good your<br />instruments are,you simply cannot predict the weather with 100%<br />accuracy over a long term basis and forecast it.</p>
<p>Q: What is the Butterfly Effect ?Matsyavatara<br />A: It is the most important component of a chaotic<br />system.Basically,small perturbations results in amplifications which<br />completely destroys the original nature of the system and makes<br />prediction impossible.<br />If a butterfly flaps its wings in Africa,it could result in a cyclone<br />in USA.(Mark the word COULD).A highly dumbed down explanation of the<br />butterfly effect is in the film Anniyan,where Vikram's sister dies<br />because a liquor shop owner sells liquor on a dry day.</p>
<p>Q: OK, how does Dasavatharam incorporate it ?<br />A: In essence,Dasavatharam talks about 8 characters who are<br />inconsequential as such,but are integrated in a larger picture.Without<br />Bush,the plane would have been called back.Without Shinghen, Govind<br />would be dead.Without the tsunami,the world would have been<br />destroyed.Even Krishnaveni Patti plays a very important role.If she<br />had not put the vial in the idol,maybe Govind would have recovered it<br />then and there and a powerful weapon would have been unleashed.The<br />very fact that it went into the idol meant that it was being<br />accelerated to its destiny.Without Kaifulla Khan, Govind would have<br />never escaped;the list simply goes on.</p>
<p>Q:OK,so does the film talk about theism or atheism?<br />A:Neither.It talks about how humans drive the destiny of the world.</p>
<p>The idol that is drowned in the sea along with Rangarajan in 12th<br />century by Chozha king results in a fault being developed at the<br />bottom of the ocean and creates tremors more than 800 years later.<br />These tremors result in the Tsunami. This again is a classic case of<br />Butterfly Effect wherein a seemingly inconsequential event (the<br />drowning of the idol) saves Tamil Nadu from being wiped off the face<br />of the earth.</p>
<p>The 1st scene is perfectly connected to the climax, remember what<br />Kamal says in the first scene, that he will not say "Om Nama Shivaya"<br />, but Asin tells him to chant it , but still Kamal refuses , ( in this<br />kamal in his story tries to tell that ) Nambi believes in his god more<br />than anything, but Asin feels "Its ok if we change the god or chant<br />other god's name, its life thats most important." Now if u see the<br />climax its JUST OPPOSITE?. Kamal doesn't believe in god much and<br />values lives of people the most?. but Asin deeply believes in god and<br />that too this dialogue comes when both Asin and Kamal's hand is on the<br />god which came from the sea , and it also means that they are getting<br />united from the place they departed hundreds of years back ( Kamal and<br />Asin).The connection between the 1st scene and the climax in the movie<br />shows the generation circle combined with supernatural powers of GOD<br />and destiny?..!!!</p>
<p>If you watch it closely u can also find another actor who has done<br />double action other than Asin and Kamal.<br />Asin's father Sahasranamam [12th Century], in the beginning he says to<br />Nambi "Panchatchira manthirathai sollitu vaango mappillai" and at the<br />End [After tsunami] he says "Avar enna jathiyo inga vaanga paati ".<br />Another Eg. of Chaos Theory and circle of life.</p>
<p>JUST IMAGINE THE CHAOS THEORY IN A TAMIL FILM ??<br />WILL ANYONE HAVE THE GUTS TO HANDLE THIS KIND OF A SUBJECT IN A TAMIL<br />FILM?</p>
<p>ONLY KAMAL HAS THE GUTS?. U ROCK!!</p>
<p>FURTHER????-</p>
<p>Nambi explanation</p>
<p>Okay, this is slightly outside the chaotic system driving the film as<br />ideologies like God,the madness surrounding such ideologies and<br />decides to tell the story of the Shaivite-Vaishnavite conflict to show<br />how people go crazy in the name of God as an example.</p>
<p>As a loose end,it gets tied up in the end,when the Ranganathar idol is<br />thrown out of the sea due to the tsunami which highlights the cyclic<br />nature of life.Actually the Nambi character highlights both Chaos and<br />Karma which I explained.That is the brilliance of this film,there is<br />so much to see and understand.</p>
<p>Another explanation(and this is slightly far fetched? as explained<br />earlier) is that Govind is in fact the reincaranation of Nambi. As<br />Nambi he couldn't protect God and died in the name of God.In order to<br />fulfill his Karma,he is reincarnated as Govind Ramasamy who ultimately<br />saves the world from destruction.The idol in the end somewhat hints to<br />this theory; his story began with the idol and it ends with the idol.<br />As far as the connection with Nambi character and events in 12th<br />Century goes?<br />The connection is based on the "Butterfly effect ".</p>
<p>When Govind and Andal goes to the bury the idol in the sands, Andal<br />will stumble on a particular stone couple of times?This is the same<br />stone as the one from 12th Century hen Kothai rips her Thaali and<br />flings it at Kulothunga Chozan?it will end up hanging on the stone.<br />So, the implied message here is Andal is Kothai reborn in the 21s century.</p>
<p>During the encounter with Santhana Bharathi in the sand quarry, it is<br />repeat of the incident from 12th century. Instead of Kulothunga<br />Chozhan, it is the Sand Mafia which tries to inflict damage on the land.</p>
<p>This movie is a brilliant juxtaposition of independent characters<br />whose paths cross, if only briefly, which is stunning example of Chaos<br />Theory.</p>
<p>The idol that is drowned in the sea along with Rangarajan in 12th<br />century by Chozha king results in a fault being developed at the<br />bottom of the ocean and creates tremors more than 800 years later.<br />These tremors result in the Tsunami. This again is a classic case of<br />Butterfly Effect wherein a seemingly inconcsequential event (the<br />drowing of the idol) saves Tamil Nadu from being wiped out off the<br />face of the earth.</p>
<p>But actually kamal has not left anything for our imagination?<br />Explanation struck the right chord, Kamal does tell to Asin in a<br />dialogue that idol which gets sunken back then gets struck between the<br />tectonic plates under the sea and causes tsunami?<br />Many people missed this dialogue i guess. Kamal's accent was so very<br />perfect Tamil, that many people missed it?. Being perfect Is a Problem<br />by Itself !!! :)</p>
<p>Although the explanation is a least possible theory, that is what<br />"Chaos Theory" And "Butterfly Effect" are all about.</p>
<p>Its not just the statue that caused the tsunami, but it just started a<br />large chain of effects which kept multiplying exponentially and<br />finally lead to it after 800 years?.!!</p>
<p>Why just say this concept is perfectly illogical? it is possible?<br />thats what i have been explaining all the while !!!</p>
<p>The story line is that things going wrong are made to be right which<br />involves many people and countries knowingly or unknowingly.</p>
<p>Knowingly:</p>
<p>-Bush, Manmohan Singh, Govindh, Fletcher, Balaram Naidu, Mallika<br />Sherawath.</p>
<p>Unknowingly:</p>
<p>-Nambi's drowning to death with the heavy statue causes simple changes<br />to the seabed that causes a devastating tsunami 800 years later<br />[According to Chaos theory it is possible.... although it is least<br />probable... It is possible.. so nothing TOTALLY WRONG About it ]<br />-Poovaragan(actually saved kamal unknowingly?when poovaragan enters<br />kamal and asin were caught by those manal kollayargal.There poovaragan<br />distracts the gang helping kamal to escape),<br />- Avatar Singh(gave way to Fletcher to escape in the airport unknowingly),<br />- Japanese(saved govind from fletcher, he knows he is saving but he<br />doesnt know about the play and was there only for revenge),<br />- Kallifulla and family(saved govind unknowingly)??..<br />-Vincent is a dalit leader of a lower caste( the so called ) but saved<br />an Iyengar Girl ??and at the end becomes the son of the Iyengar Paati !!<br />- If Shingen Narahashi's sister was not killed, Fletcher could have<br />killed govind and used the virus for wrong purpose..</p>
<p>This is based on Chaos Theory..!!!!! </p>

          Kamal Haasan Dasavatharam Movie Review, Facts and Fiction        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Satish, nobody disputes your liking the moviel- liking<br />a movie is purely someone's taste, there is nothing in<br />it to be defended about..</p>
<p>I disagree with you that 'super ego' is a 'parinama<br />valarchi', it is in fact an immature way to grow. Yes<br />Kamal has done many roles and we can't expect him to<br />do similar roles. But that does not mean he can do<br />everything either, acting is a talent, same way script<br />writing/direction/everything is a talent some people<br />are blessed with. A good script writer need not be a<br />good actor and vice versa. A similar example to what<br />Kamal did is what the late NTR did in telugu - his<br />Narthanashala made in 1953 with a great team (SVR as<br />Kechaka and Savirti as Draupadi) is a great classic<br />and is even used at some universities abroad for<br />indian mythological studies. NTR tried to remake the<br />same movie with himself playing all the key roles -<br />Krishna, Arjuna, Kechaka etc. The movie flopped<br />miserably and was quite unbearable.</p>
<p>Growth is possible if one is realistic about one's own<br />talents and capabilities. Laurence Olivier and Peter O<br />Toole in the later days did custom stage appearances<br />and taught a lot of young actors. Sivaji did not<br />venture beyond his own acting capabilities but did<br />some great very mature roles. SV Rangarao cautiously<br />directed couple of movies and stopped soon after. </p>
<p>The comparison to Rajini movies is the same thing that<br />used to happen between MGR and Sivaji fans. Am not<br />venturing there.</p>

Its produced only for one<br />  purpose - money <br />  for the producers and entertainment for the<br />  audience. </p>
<p>  And definitely Dasavatharam is an wholesome<br />  entertainer and surely a <br />  milestone in Indian cinema. Except Kamal no one else<br />  could dare to <br />  dream such things.</p>
<p>  Everyone says, they missed the Kamal of Nayagan or<br />  moondram pirai or <br />  sagara sangamam....when he has done all those<br />  already, why should he <br />  do the same thing again? Everyone accepts that Kamal<br />  is an <br />  outstanding actor and he has portrayed best of his<br />  roles, then why <br />  should he do which already he is good at? Surely any<br />  skilled person <br />  will try to do something different which has already<br />  not been done. <br />  Microsoft's windows 95 was a mega hit. Does this<br />  mean, they should <br />  not have ventured into any other OS of the later<br />  years? Should they <br />  be selling only 95 till date because they were good<br />  at that, at that <br />  point of time? Silly argument, i would say.</p>
<p>  Its all parinama valarchi. If it has to be termed<br />  super ego, let it <br />  be. He has the stuff to be an egoist. After all he<br />  is human. </p>
<p>  We should be magnanimous to appreciate the thought<br />  process and hard <br />  work went into this at the same time comment on the<br />  flaws. If Kamal <br />  made us to cry in Mahanadhi, doesnt mean he should<br />  do that in every <br />  movie. Watch the movie as an entertainer and surely<br />  its worth it.</p>
<p>  And if I want to derive philosophy out of it, Kamal,<br />  knowingly or <br />  unknowingly has done a wonderful job by giving<br />  beautiful philosophy <br />  n this movie.</p>

        <p>Dear Dr Sri, I did mention Navarathiri as a classic in<br />my response. Navarithiri is a true showcase of<br />Sivaji's acting talent, it is very difficult to choose<br />which of those 9 roles he really excelled in, they<br />were all one better than the other and the movie truly<br />did not have one dull moment. </p>
<p>The reason why Navarithiri stands apart, the actor<br />once again did what he was good at - acting, and left<br />other things to people who excelled in them. Second, a<br />strong story line and no other distraction for the<br />audience.</p>

<p>  I have heard two versions of arguements Ill write my<br />  opinion on Wedenesday..after watching it..</p>
<p>  Campaorisons have been made to Shivaji....MMKR...<br />  Shivaji was a out and out no holds barred masala....</p>
<p>  People talk about Kamal because he has talent and is<br />  capalble of doing some remarkable roles....But I am<br />  tending to agree with most why do all of them? Only<br />  to do one more than Sivaji....Navarathiri...he didnt<br />  have highfy holywood make up man but each charector<br />  stood out on its own...I am amazed no one talked<br />  about that at all....</p>
<p>  MMKR was good without Make up...Indiana and Avvai<br />  Shanmugi were good with makeup though a lot of<br />  expressions were lost in AV....Suganya in Indian<br />  will beg to differ cause she may well have been<br />  weraing a mask....</p>
<p>  So thats where people come from....</p>
<p>  I liked his Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu where he had acted<br />  his age in a nice gripping Thriller though people<br />  said that movie was 2 decades ahead of Indian<br />  Culture and Indian Audience...Unfortunately Truth<br />  Hurts thats what happens in real world Gory<br />  ...stuff...Yes it was a bit upsetting to see two<br />  doctors as the culprits but hey they are human as<br />  well and there are flawed humans in all walks of<br />  life</p>

        <p>If somebody paint the historical references made in the movie, then we<br />our members will find out the percentage of truth behind it. We may be<br />able to consider whether the movie can be used as a reference to<br />history or purely fictional, entertainer and should be disregarded.</p>
<p>So far, it seems that the reference to 12th Century is not relevant in<br />the movie. Request members who have seen it to post the dialogues,<br />real life character names, etc.,</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I have tried hard not to reveal any spoilers in here.Apologies if <br />there are any.</p>
<p>I personally think the movie is pretty good. The first five minutes <br />of the movie where Kamal starts off narrating his views about Science <br />and God is pretty important and forms the basis of the story. The <br />12th century story and the current happenings also gels well with <br />that theory. (Of course I do not endorse that view though)</p>
<p>Kamal also tries to provide some insights into Chaos theory(and the <br />butterfly effect). Only if one watches the movie in that perspective, <br />one can understand some of the key characters of the movie and how <br />some of the smaller acts(which although appears silly though) that <br />they perform have an impact at the end. (Kamal might have marked 10 <br />such characters and chosen to play the 10 characters because of this <br />reason too and so his egoistic self might not be the only reason why <br />he chose to play 10 characters). It is a very good screenplay trying <br />to connect the various characters, painting them in different shades, <br />sizes and shapes and also some times telling the story at places in a <br />non-linear sequence. If one doesn't understand the reason behind the <br />creation of 10 characters one wouldn't be able to appreciate their <br />presence. Kamal as usual tries to put his atheistic/agnostic views <br />about God and it did not really matter to me, as it would take a lot <br />more than just a movie to change my opinion in this respect. As it <br />is expected of Kamal, each and every minute detail on the characters <br />has been very well etched.I also thought that some of the names of <br />the characters in the movie were interesting(when compared to real <br />avatars).In my opinion, Kamal as a perfectionist has exceeded my <br />expectations easily and I beleive, as a movie Dasavatharam stands <br />really tall. </p>
<p>Yes, the graphics could have been done better and they do not live up <br />to the hollywood standard that most of the people expected it to be. </p>
<p>I think the amount of money I spent for the movie ticket is really <br />worth every penny, for the value of entertainment it provided to me.I <br />do not think the movie is that bad as it has been projected in some <br />of the reviews.</p>

        <p>Dear All<br />There have been a flurry of activities in the last two weeks...Been busy teacjing in Paris and in a conference in Bologna Italy...</p>
<p>I have heard two versions of arguements Ill write my opinion on Wedenesday..after watching it..</p>
<p>Campaorisons have been made to Shivaji....MMKR...<br />Shivaji was a out and out no holds barred masala....</p>
<p>People talk about Kamal because he has talent and is capalble of doing someremarkable roles....But I am tending to agree with most why do all of them? Only to do one more than Sivaji....Navarathiri...he didnt have highfy holywood make up man but each charector stood out on its own...I am amazed no one talked about that at all....</p>
<p>MMKR was good without Make up...Indiana and Avvai Shanmugi were good with makeup though a lot of expressions were lost in AV....Suganya in Indian willbeg to differ cause she may well have been weraing a mask....</p>
<p>So thats where people come from....</p>
<p>I liked his Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu where he had acted his age in a nice gripping Thriller though people said that movie was 2 decades ahead of Indian Culture and Indian Audience...Unfortunately Truth Hurts thats what happens in real world Gory ...stuff...Yes it was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  upsetting to see two doctors as the culprits but hey they are human as well and there are flawed humans in all walks of life</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

          Kamal Haasan Dasavatharam Movie Review, Facts and Fiction        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>As for me, the movie just satisfied my expectation. The 2nd half was a<br /><acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of a drag and the most irritating characters were that of Asin's<br />and the muslim Kamalhassan. Asin was total crack and that was the<br />biggest minus of the movie. Another thing was the Panjathantiram type<br />of comedy midst of supposedly high intensity chase. Other than that<br />the movie was a great entertainer. The fight sequence, I could easily<br />say the best in the indian movies so far, almost at par with the<br />hollywood movies. The best Kamal is that of the dalit leader<br />Aravamudan, a character made to talk only to the point, no more no<br />less.<br />As Sathis pointed out, the link between the 12th century sequence and<br />the rest of the movie is not obvious. I made an interpretation that,<br />Kamal and Asin gets killed by the statue and gets together again by<br />the statue :-)</acronym></p>
<p>Over all it was a good entertainer, historic folks of our group will<br />be disappointed though.</p>
<p>regards,<br />siva.</p>
