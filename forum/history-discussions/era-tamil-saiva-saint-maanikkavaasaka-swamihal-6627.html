</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>The era of the Tamil Saiva Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal</p>
<p>Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal also known as Saint Thiruvaathavoorar was<br />one among the four great Saiva Saints of "Tamil Saivaism", of the<br />pre-medieval and medieval period Tamil Nadu. However he has not been<br />included among the 63 - Tamil Saiva Saints listed in the Tamil Saivite<br />religious work "Periyapuraanam" also known as the "Thiruththondar<br />Puraanam", composed by the sage/poet Seakkeelaar.</p>
<p>With him the total number of Tamil Saiva Saints of this period were 64 -<br />in number. The reason for he not being included in the Periyapuraanam by<br />sage/poet Seakkeelaar is yet to be known.</p>
<p>It has been already determined that the approximate period of the Tamil<br />Saiva Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar of Tamil Nadu as A.D.568-649.<br />of two references on the miracle of foxes being transformed into horses,<br />that is said to have taken place during the time of Saint<br />Maanikkavaasakar - by the grace of God Siva, which are as follows.</p>
<p>"?.Nariyai Kuthirai seivaanum?."</p>
<p>4th Thirumurai, (Pathikam - 4, verse - 2)</p>
<p>and as "?..Nariyinaar Pari yaa(hi) mahilkintrathor<br />Periyanar?."</p>
<p>5th Thirumurai (Pathikam - 12, verse - 9)</p>
<p>(Note: Kuthirai &amp; Pari in Tamil = Horse)</p>
<p>Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal himself makes references to this miracle<br />that occured in his life time in his own Tamil Saiva Religious work<br />named "Thiruvaasakam" as follows:</p>
<p>"??Nariyai Kuthirai Pariyaakki gnalam ellaam nihalviththu Periya<br />Thennan Mathurai ellaam pichcha thetrum Perumthuraiyai??."</p>
<p>Thiruvaasakam - "Ananthamaalai", verse - 7</p>
<p>"??Narikal ellaam perum Kuthirai aakkiyava antre un<br />perarulle?."</p>
<p>Thiruvaasakam - "Thiruvesaravu", verse - 7</p>
<p>"??Nariyai Kuthirai aakkiya nanmaiyum?.."</p>
<p>Thiruvaasakam - "Poatri Thiruahaval", line - 35/36</p>
<p>"?..Mathurai Perunan maa nahar irunthu<br />Kuthirai sevahanaakiya kolkaiyum??"</p>
<p>Thiruvaasakam - Poatri Thiruahaval, line - 35/36</p>
<p>Hence it is very clear from the above references of Saint<br />Maanikkavaasakar himself - in his own work "Thiruvaasakam", that the<br />above miracle mentioned by Saiva Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar in his<br />Thevarem (right above) is in fact correct, and occurred during the time<br />of Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal who lived before the year A.D.568 -<br />the appoximate year of birth of Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar.</p>
<p>In the "Thiruvaasakam" of Saint Maanikkavaasakar, even though there are<br />references to the Pandiya king of that period, there is no mention of<br />his actual name in same.</p>
<p>However in his other Tamil Saiva Religious work the<br />"Thiruchitrambalakovaiyaar" (also known as "Thirukkovaiyaar)" there are<br />two references to the Pandiyan king of his time namely the Varaguna<br />Pandiyan - as follows.</p>
<p>"?.Varagunanaam thennavan eaththum Chitrambalaththaan?.."</p>
<p>Thirukkovaiyaar - verse 306</p>
<p>" ??puyaloangalar sadaiyettravan Chitrambalam pugalum mayal<br />oangi irung khaliyaanai Varagunan 'vetpin vaiththa kayal' oangu irung<br />chilai kondu?."</p>
<p>Thirukkovaiyaar - verse 327</p>
<p>Note: The above reference goes to prove Varagunan (the Pandiyan king)<br />referred in Thirukkovaiyaar by Saint Maanikkavaasakar, was different<br />from the Varaguna Pandiyan - 2 of (A.D.862 -880) and the Varaguna<br />Pandiyan - 1 of (A.D.800-830), as the Inscriptions and other historical<br />and literary Documents on the latter two kings have not mentioned of<br />they having carved the Pandiyan emblem the 'kayal fish' on the Himalayan<br />mountain (vetpin - on the mountain).</p>
<p>Hence it is evident that the (earliest) Varagunan being that of<br />Thirukkovaiyaar who possibly went on an expedition towards the north of<br />India, and carved the 'kayal fish' on the Himalayan mountain.</p>
<p>Further though it is not specifically mentioned in Thirukkovaiyaar that<br />the mountain under reference was Himalayas, no Tamil kings be it Chera,<br />Chola or Pandiya would have ever considered it as a 'great pride' to say<br />that they carved their royal emblems on a mountain within Tamil Nadu,<br />instead of the great Himalayas as seen in many Tamil literary works of<br />the Sangam &amp; medieval periods.</p>
<p>The scholar who highlighted this important reference in Thirukkovaiyar<br />'for the first time', was Dr.Sivapriya in her book titled<br />the'Maanikkavaasakare koorum Maanikkavaasakarin varalaarum kaalamum'</p>
<p>The fact the "Thirukkovaiyaar" too was composed by Saint<br />Thiruvathavoorar is confirmed by Saint Nambiyaandaar Nambi as follows.</p>
<p>"?.varu vaasahaththin muttrunarntha thonai van Thillai mannai<br />Thiruvaathavoor Siva Paaththiyaan sei Thirucitrambala<br />porulaar thahu Thirukkovai kannde mattra porulai<br />therulaatha ullaththavar kavi paadi sirippeere?."</p>
<p>11th Thirumurai ? Koyil Thiruppanniyar Viruththam by Saint<br />Nambiyaandaar Nambi ? verse 58</p>
<p>Hence it is clear the Varaguna Pandiyan refered in the<br />Thiruchitrambalakovaiyaar too like Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal lived<br />before the Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar's year of birth A.D.568.</p>
<p>A Sanskrit poetic work titled "Pandiya Kulothaya" too mentions of the<br />miracle of the foxes being transformed into horses during the time of<br />one "Vaathapuri Naayakar" meaning the Saint of Vaathapuri the region of<br />Thiruvaathavur. It also mentions the Pandiya king Varaguna Pandiyan of<br />that period who lost his kingdom to his brother met the Siva Bakthar the<br />Vaathapuri Naayakar and with his blessings he regained his kingdom and<br />continued to rule. It also states that Vaathapuri Naayaker served later<br />under this Pandiyan as his minister. There is also reference in same to<br />the miracle of foxes being transformed into horses,</p>
<p>(Refer "Aaiyvu Katturaihal"- by Kudanthai N.Sethuraman page<br />59-60)</p>
<p>Further from the Tamil grammetical work titled "Kuvalayaanantham" we get<br />two further valuable informations as follows in it's `Sirrappu<br />Paayiram'.</p>
<p>"?thinakara meni Sivan upathesam manathinil unarntha<br />Vaathavooraane?.."</p>
<p>"??Kuvalayaanantham enum noolinai seithanan sahala kalayum<br />therinththu valar Maanikkavaasakan enum gnana<br />thesika sivayohiye mandalam sol Varaguna Pandiyan<br />mun gnana maamaraiyor alangara vadasol ahak<br />kondu iyalaal uraippathanaal Koodal vaalum<br />Kottravan meena thuvasa kurusil nanpaaith<br />than Thamilaal vilakkum ena, Vaathavooran<br />saatrinaan vadamoliyaal thirinthu ulaavum<br />enthisai en `Mimaangisai' enum noolin<br />iyalbu anaiththum Kuvalayaaanantham entre?."</p>
<p>"Kuvalayaanantham" ? published by Dr.S.V.Subramanian, Ulaha<br />Thamilaratchi Niruvanam, Chennai.</p>
<p>Hence from the Saint Thirunaavukkarasar's reference to the miracle<br />in his Thevaram, and the references in the Kuvalayaanantham and Pandiya<br />Kulothaya to this same miracle, we can safely conclude the Saint<br />Thiruvaathavoorar (also known as Saint Maanikkavaasakar in<br />Kuvalayaanantham and Vaathapuri Nayakar in Pandiya Kulothaya), and the<br />Varaguna Pandiyan mentioned in latter two references, it is further<br />confirmed that both lived before Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar that<br />is before A.D. 568.</p>
<p>The instance when Saint Thiruvathavoorar received a further name as<br />Maanikkavaasagar is clearly stated in the two Tamil works named the<br />"Thiruvilaiyadal Puraanam" and "Thiruvaathavoorar Puraanam", was at<br />the occasion when he first started singing songs in praise of God Siva<br />composed of "jewel (Maanikkam) like sentences (Vaasakam)". This name<br />Maanikkavaasakar later was shortened and also used as "Vaasakan" or<br />"Vaasakar" to refer him.</p>
<p>We now find two other instances where Saint Maanikkavaasakar has been<br />referred to by his short names, again in the Thevarems of the Saint<br />Thirunaavukkarasar as follows.</p>
<p>"??Kudamula Nanthi easanai Vaasakan aahak kondar?.."</p>
<p>5th Thirumurai - Pathikam - 112, verse - 2</p>
<p>"??Mangala Vaasakar kusaiyum angaiyit kosamum kondavar?.."</p>
<p>5th Thirumurai - Pathikam - 34, verse - 9</p>
<p>Saint Thirunaavukkarasar, too takes the period of the former as earlier<br />than A.D.568 the year of birth of the latter.</p>
<p>The "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" of Paranjothi Munivar mentions that<br />Saint Thiruvaathavoorar subsequently received the name Maanikkavaasakar,<br />and the ruling king during his time was Arimarthana Pandiyan.</p>
<p>But the same "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" relates to a separate event in<br />respect of Varaguna Pandiyan as a Pandiyan who fought and won a battle<br />with Cholas. This from the history of the medieval Pandiyas we know was<br />the Vargunan - 2 (A.D.862-880). The "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" doesnot<br />associate him with Saint Maanikkavaasakar, or with the story of the<br />miracle of foxes being transformed into horses.</p>
<p>Hence the above gives us a hint that the Varaguna Pandiyan who won the<br />Cholas is the latter Varaguna Pandiyan - 2 (A.D.862-880), and the<br />Pandiyan king who was living during the period of Saint Maanikkavaasakar<br />at the time of the miracle of foxes being transformed into horses was a<br />Pandiya king different to the Varaguna Pandiya - 2, whom it mentions as<br />Arimarthana Pandiyan.</p>
<p>Hence from the references in the "Pandiya Kulothaya", "Kuvalayaanantham"<br />both of which mentions - of the miracle and the Varaguna Pandiyan and<br />the "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" which too mentions of this same miracle<br />but the Arimarthana Pandiyan, we could conclude the Pandiyan of that<br />period as Arimarthanan aana Varaguna Pandiyan (Arimarthanan alias<br />Varaguna Pandiyan) who was no doubt an earlier Pandiyan with the same<br />name Varagunan, and again reaffirm that he was quite different to the<br />Varaguna Pandiyan - 1 (A.D.800-830) and Varaguna Pandiyan - 2 (A.D.862<br />-880).</p>
<p>Also it should be noted that there are no evidences or inscriptions of<br />Varaguna Pandiyan - 2 (A.D.862 -880) to confirm that the Saint Vathapuri<br />Nayager blessed him to get back his lost kingdom as per the "Pandiya<br />Kulothaya" and that too from his own brother. Hence the reference in<br />"Pandiya Kulothaya" must be to the Aritmarthanan aana Varaguna Pandiyan<br />of the earlier period.</p>
<p>Further we have an interesting information in the Thiruvilaiyaadal<br />Puraanam, that it was after eleven generations of Pandiyan kings after<br />Arimarthanan aana Varaguna Paandiyan came the Koon Pandiyan of the Saint<br />Thirugnanasampanthar period. If we take an average of 30 years for each<br />king's period of rule approximately, we note Arimarthana Pandiyan<br />lived (30 x 11) three hundred and thirty years the before Pandiyan<br />Nedumaran (also known as Koon Pandiyan), that is around A.D.312(642<br />-330).</p>
<p>Now referring to the religious work "Thiruvaasakam" of Saint<br />Maanikkavaasagar, we note that there is hardly any reference to Jain<br />religion in same, as compared to the Tamil "Thirumurai Thevarams" of<br />other three great Saints, which refers to Jainism in many places as<br />opposed to Saivaism. Hence we can be sure that Saint Maanikkavaasakar<br />lived during the period when Jainism has not yet gained much deep roots<br />in Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>In the year A.D.350 a king from a ruling dynasty of Karnataka by the<br />name Kalabhras (Kalappirar), invaded Tamil Nadu and Kerala and defeated<br />the Chola, Pandiya and Chera kings, and enforced their religion the<br />Jainism that prevailed in a big way in Karnataka, into Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>(Note: The year of Kalabhra invasion is as per the text "Life and<br />Works of Buddagosha" by K.C.Law, extracted from "Pallavar<br />Varalaaru" by Dr.M.Rasamanikkanar).</p>
<p>This is confirmed by the following reference in in Tamil Saiva work<br />titled "Kalladam"</p>
<p>"??padai naangu udan Panchavan thuranthu Mathurai vaviya Karunada<br />venthan<br />Aruhar sarnthu nintru arutpani adaippa??."</p>
<p>In the above Panchavan is the Pandiyan and "Karunada venthan" is the<br />Kalabra king, and "Aruhar" are the followers of Jain religion.</p>
<p>Kalaadam ? 57, lines 12-13</p>
<p>This date of Kalabhra invasion looks realistic as we have approximately<br />determined the date of the Arimarthana Pandiyan around A.D.312, and<br />possibly the Kalabhra invasion took place during the rule of his son the<br />Sakanaatha Pandiyan in A.D.350 who is known to us from the<br />"Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam".</p>
<p>The Buddhism and Jainism had already spread to some extent in Tamil Nadu<br />earlier during the 3rd Sangam Period, but it was only after the Kalabhra<br />capture of Tamil Nadu the Jainsm became deeply rooted as a religion of<br />this region with the patronage of this king.</p>
<p>Hence it is clear the period of Saint Maanikkavaasakar earlier<br />determined as before A.D.568 the birth year of Saint Thirunaavukkarasar,<br />could now be pushed forward further to a period before A.D.350.</p>
<p>Further from the early days of Tamil Nadu the "Saivaism<br />religion" having "Siva Agamas" as their principal religious<br />texts - long prevailed, and in the "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" we are<br />informed that Saint Maanikkavaasakar too was more interested in learning<br />the "Siva Agamas " in his youth.</p>
<p>This may be the reason while Saint Thirugnanasampanthar, Saint<br />Thirunaavukkarasar and Saint Sundaramoorththy Naayanar have mentioned in<br />many of their Thevaarems to the Vedas &amp; Vedism in addition to Saivaism,<br />Saint Maanikkavaasakar speaks more on Agamas and Saivaism than the Vedas<br />in his Thiruvaasakam. Vedism though was already in existance in Tamil<br />Nadu from the Sangam period, it became deeply rooted in Tamil Nadu only<br />during the period of Pallavas.</p>
<p>Hence it is clear Saint Maanikkavaasakar lived before the invasion of<br />Tamil Nadu by Kalabhras around A.D.350, long before Jainism &amp; Vedism<br />deeply rooted in Tamil Nadu during Kalabhra and Pallava periods.</p>
<p>Further this conclusion is supported by another reference in the<br />"Thiruvaasakam" by Saint Maanikkavaasakar as follows:</p>
<p>".....Mannan, pari misai vantha<br />Vallal Perunthurai meya<br />Thennavan, Cheralan, Cholan,<br />seer Puyangan vara koovai....."</p>
<p>Thiruvaasakam - 'Kuyit Paththu', verse 7</p>
<p>In the above verse (in addition to all other verses) in the 'Kuyit<br />Paththu' composed by Saint Maanikkavaasakar, he is asking the Cuckoo<br />(Kuyil) to coo calling God Siva to (give vision to him), whom he<br />describes as Mannan, Vallal, Thennavan(Pandiyan), Cheralan, Cholan and<br />Puyangan. Since he lived in a period before Kalabhra or Pallava period<br />he has made exemplary note to God Siva as the Thennavan, Cheralan, and<br />Cholan only.</p>
<p>(Note: Should he have lived during the period of Varaguna Pandiyan - 2<br />or - 1 then possibly he would have also referred to the Kalabhra or<br />Pallava too or instead, who were the leading ruling dynasties of Tamil<br />Nadu of that period)</p>
<p>Now from a Copper Plate Grant that remained among the Christians of<br />Kollam in Kerala State we note the following text..</p>
<p>"?..After the royal punishment implemented against 72 - families of<br />Vellalar of Kaviripoompattinam who believed and joined the Christian<br />faith, they boarded a ship and went to the the place Kurakkeni (Kollam)<br />where the (other) Kurakkeni Christians too lived like relations in the<br />year A.D.293. The Christians from Niranam too (north of Kollam) came to<br />Kurakkeni and saw the Tamils there and followed few Tamil customs and<br />Malayalam customs and lived there.</p>
<p>(During this time) the one who performed miracles (and) by the name<br />Maanikkavaasakar met the Christians who came newly to this region, by<br />his miracles set the God he worshiped on them and caused fever,<br />faintishness, and crippling of limbs, and killing the (domestic) animals<br />and those who became sick thus when they humbly meet him and receive<br />holy ash (thiruneeru) and on applying they get cured (of sickness )and<br />rid off evil spirits.</p>
<p>As it was a country of many Saaviya religion, those who respect him on<br />the sly take them to Maanikkavaasakar, and listen to Panchaakra<br />(mantra), and on the sly give donations to temple, and going and preying<br />at temple festivals, and on the sly listening to the religious stories<br />and Kaaviyaas and Mantras.</p>
<p>During this time the 24 families who came from Cholamandaam and the<br />others who came and met Maannikkavaasagar and the 72 families gave and<br />got brides among their families and lived in unity. During that time the<br />72 families got together at the instance of the death of the leader who<br />took up the leadership and executed all assignments, 8 families among<br />the 72 families who got absorbed in the miracles of Maanikkavaasakar and<br />4 families who searched and met him and 20 families who were of this<br />region in all 32 (families) 114 people met with one mind insisted such a<br />respectable leader's body to be covered with new cloth ans cremated.</p>
<p>While the other 94 families in the Malayala 339 families, the Kurakkeni<br />Christians too from the time embraced the Christianity to this day<br />insisted that the the body of the dead be covered in white cloth and be<br />buried in their (own) places, then the former (group) insisted they<br />liked to hear the Guru Mantara of Panchakkara of their forefathers and<br />intake the Panchakavya of the cow dung, urine, milk, curd, ghee, and if<br />you do not listen to the words of Seedar (Sheeshayas)we 119 people will<br />leave your religion.</p>
<p>And so saying openly approached Maanikkavaasakar and arranged to be made<br />the godly image of Maanikkavaasakar installed it at a region (known) as<br />the Panaiyin Naarukaa and called those families after Mannikkavasakar as<br />"Manigramakkaarar". Those who did not follow the guru mantra of<br />Mannikkavasakar and apply the holy ash (being) 96 families jointly used<br />white cloth to cover dead bodies and buried within as practice they were<br />called the Christians??"</p>
<p>(Translation into English of the Tamil version of the Copper Plates from<br />Thiruvananthapuram given in the book) - titled?.<br />Maanikkavaasakar Peruman Varalaaru - by K. Subramaniyapillai.</p>
<p>The above Copper Plate text mentions of one Maanikkavaasakar who<br />performed miracles and who recited Panchaakkara (Panchaatchara) Mantra<br />the Maanikkavasakar mentioned above was a Siva worshipper. Further it is<br />said the people of this country he met were mainly of the<br />"Saaviya" (Saiva) religion. Hence the people of this region kept<br />him in high reference and even made a godly image and worshipped. From<br />the foregoing we can safely conclude he could be no other than the Saiva<br />Saint Maanikkavaasakar.</p>
<p>It is indicated in the Tamil translation that "?..72 - families of<br />Vellalar of Kaviripoompattinam who believed and joined the Christian<br />faith, they boarded a ship and went to the the place Kurakkeni (Kollam)<br />where the (other) Kurakkeni Christians too lived like relations in the<br />year A.D.293??".</p>
<p>But on my reading of the original Tamil-Granthaha writing of the Copper<br />Plates, I find a date has been omitted in the Tamil translation which<br />when included reads as "?.in A.D.315 one who performed miracles<br />(and) by the name Maanikkavaasakar?..", possibly visited<br />(Kurakkeni) Kollam from Pandiya Nadu.</p>
<p>Maanikkavasakar was 32 years.</p>
<p>".....Apparukku enbaththon(dru) arul Vaathavoorarukku<br />seppiya naalettinil theiveekam - ippuviyil<br />Sundararkku moovaaru thon Gnanasampantharkku<br />antham pathinaaru ari......"</p>
<p>Periyapuraanam - by Seakkeelaar, Thiruppananthaal Sri Kaasi Madam, Sri<br />Vaikuntham, Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>We could reasonably expect him to have held the position of chief<br />minister of the Pandiya king at an age of 24. He thereafter visited many<br />Saiva sacred places, and possibly towards the latter period of his life<br />time possibly around 30 years (A.D.315), he visted (Kurakkeni) Kollam in<br />Kerala.</p>
<p>Hence we can conclude that the Tamil Saiva Saint Maanikkavaasakar was<br />born in A.D.285 (317-32) and demised in A.D.317 (315+2), before the<br />period of Kalabra invasion around A.D.350 when Jainism has not deeply<br />rooted in TamilNadu, and at a period when Buddhism held a strong<br />position in Tamil Nadu, and during the period of the Arimarthanan alias<br />Varuguna Pandiyan who has been establised as ruling around A.D.312, at a<br />time when Saivaism with Siva Agamas as their principal texts prevailed<br />along with other religions in Tamil Nadu, and at a period when the<br />Christian faith too was gaining grounds in (Kurakkkeni) Kollam Kerala<br />(Chera Nadu) - a period long befor the Pallava rule in Tamil Nadu.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Kindly see this lead ::</p>
<p>With due regards to Dr. Jaybee and agathiar group.<br />sps<br />---------<br />Re: Manikkavasagar <br />-- In <a href="mailto:agathiyar@yahoogroups.com">agathiyar@yahoogroups.com</a>, "vittalsatish" <vittalsatish@y... <br />wrote:<br />Its kind of confusing, if his period is prior to Appar,<br />why he is not one of the 63 nayanmars, Sekkhizar also has not<br />mentioned him in his periya puranam.</vittalsatish@y...></p>
<p>I had addressed this very question once:<br /><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agathiyar/message/32342" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agathiyar/message/32342">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agathiyar/message/32342</a><br /><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agathiyar/message/32348" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agathiyar/message/32348">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agathiyar/message/32348</a><br />Hope you read Tamil.</p>
<p>The key lies in the type of mukthi yearned for -<br />Padamukthi or Paramukthi. Saint Sekkizar declares in<br />the beginning (in Thiru-k-kutta cirappu) itself that<br />his hagiography is only about the devotees, not even<br />keen on (kUdum anpil kumpidalE anRi vIdum vEndar)<br />Paramukthi. And Saint Manickavasagar stands<br />(meyyE un pon adikaL kaNdu inRu vIdu utREn)<br />for Paramukthi.</p>
<p>Manickavasagar's verses like `Thiru-anda-p-pakuthi<br />and Jnana thAzisai' are also of different genre.<br />Saint Sambandhar cries in the 'VettaveLi' of Thillai<br />for transending time/space - 'kAlam peRa azuthAr'.<br />And Manivasagar has already crossed that state also,<br />narrating his cosmic travel in Thiru-anda-p-pakuthi.</p>
<p>See his specific usage `aiyOn' in 'aNu-th tharum thanmaiyil aiyOn<br />kANka'.</p>
<p>'ai' is not only the Vani bija, seed syllable, but also the<br />fundamental `Vidya' behind all that created, as per Tantra Sastra.<br />AiyOn is the state of non-separable state of Siva-Sakthi.</p>
<p>Shall write more later.</p>

        <p>May I introduce myself.<br />Im a tamil with only a smattering understanding of the ( old Poetic) language.<br /> Ive been following this " controversy " of St MVaasagar for many years.Whist amny of the points raised are nearly convincing ,here are a few comments.<br />1) Neelaganda Shasthri firmly comes down to a period AFTER Sundramurti Nayanaar( one of the  latter 2 Varagunas?)<br />1a He points out that the Tamil used is much more DISTINCT( = easy to delve into ) than that of the othe 3 samayakkuravar. ( I personally can understand it, in contradistinction to the other tirumarais.<br />1b Sundaramurti never mentions MVgar in his poem at Tiruvaarur  when he mentionas all the other 62 saints.</p>
<p>[ Extract from temple net on Tiruvarur and Sundramurthy Nayanaar --</p>
<p>"  The Tiruttondattogai of Sundarar lists the names of the 62<br />Nayanmars who preceded him. Sundarar along with the other 62<br />that he mentioned in his hymn on Tiruvarur constitute the arupattimoovar<br />or the 63 Saivite Saints whose life<br />history is described in detail in the Periya Puraanam - a colossal work<br />by Sekkizhaar a poet of the later Chola period. "  ]</p>
<p>2 It is quite certain that MVsagar was involved in the construction of the  Audaiyaar Kovil<br />2a . Does this temple fit into the relevant century offered? ( early AD 300+s?)                  Was there such stone temples ( ar least begun ) at that time? Even the original portions of the Tiruvaanaikkal Kovil by Kochengganan was probably later?</p>
<p>I will be grateful for some clarifications<br />DR Chandhru</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>-HI <br />Fantasatic</p>
<p>we have discussed it in this forum and many including me said that <br />the thevaram trio never mentioned manikavasakar.<br />so appar has mentioned a miracle that happened in his period but not <br />the saint himself or his remission on account of the miracle</p>
<p>any sceptic would raise the point " whether both were talking about a <br />miracle that happened even before.</p>
<p>but anyway this is a good start. to locate the time period of the <br />saint without any ambiguity.</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<p>-- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, <br />"virarajendra" <virarajendra@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  The era of the Tamil Saiva Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal</p>
<p>  Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal also known as Saint <br />Thiruvaathavoorar was<br />  one among the four great Saiva Saints of "Tamil Saivaism", of the<br />  pre-medieval and medieval period Tamil Nadu. However he has not been<br />  included among the 63 - Tamil Saiva Saints listed in the Tamil <br />Saivite<br />  religious work "Periyapuraanam" also known as the "Thiruththondar<br />  Puraanam", composed by the sage/poet Seakkeelaar.</p>
<p>  With him the total number of Tamil Saiva Saints of this period were <br />64 -<br />  in number. The reason for he not being included in the <br />Periyapuraanam by<br />  sage/poet Seakkeelaar is yet to be known.</p>
<p>  It has been already determined that the approximate period of the <br />Tamil<br />  Saiva Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar of Tamil Nadu as A.D.568-649.<br />note<br />  of two references on the miracle of foxes being transformed into <br />horses,<br />  that is said to have taken place during the time of Saint<br />  Maanikkavaasakar - by the grace of God Siva, which are as follows.</p>
<p>  "?.Nariyai Kuthirai seivaanum?."</p>
<p>  4th Thirumurai, (Pathikam - 4, verse - 2)</p>
<p>  and as "?..Nariyinaar Pari yaa(hi) mahilkintrathor<br />  Periyanar?."</p>
<p>  5th Thirumurai (Pathikam - 12, verse - 9)</p>
<p>  (Note: Kuthirai &amp; Pari in Tamil = Horse)</p>
<p>  Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal himself makes references to this <br />miracle<br />  that occured in his life time in his own Tamil Saiva Religious work<br />  named "Thiruvaasakam" as follows:</p>
<p>  "??Nariyai Kuthirai Pariyaakki gnalam ellaam nihalviththu Periya<br />  Thennan Mathurai ellaam pichcha thetrum Perumthuraiyai??."</p>
<p>  Thiruvaasakam - "Ananthamaalai", verse - 7</p>
<p>  "??Narikal ellaam perum Kuthirai aakkiyava antre un<br />  perarulle?."</p>
<p>  Thiruvaasakam - "Thiruvesaravu", verse - 7</p>
<p>  "??Nariyai Kuthirai aakkiya nanmaiyum?.."</p>
<p>  Thiruvaasakam - "Poatri Thiruahaval", line - 35/36</p>
<p>  "?..Mathurai Perunan maa nahar irunthu<br />  Kuthirai sevahanaakiya kolkaiyum??"</p>
<p>  Thiruvaasakam - Poatri Thiruahaval, line - 35/36</p>
<p>  Hence it is very clear from the above references of Saint<br />  Maanikkavaasakar himself - in his own work "Thiruvaasakam", that the<br />  above miracle mentioned by Saiva Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar <br />in his<br />  Thevarem (right above) is in fact correct, and occurred during the <br />time<br />  of Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal who lived before the year A.D.568 <br />-<br />  the appoximate year of birth of Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar.</p>
<p>  In the "Thiruvaasakam" of Saint Maanikkavaasakar, even though there <br />are<br />  references to the Pandiya king of that period, there is no mention <br />of<br />  his actual name in same.</p>
<p>  However in his other Tamil Saiva Religious work the<br />  "Thiruchitrambalakovaiyaar" (also known as "Thirukkovaiyaar)" there <br />are<br />  two references to the Pandiyan king of his time namely the Varaguna<br />  Pandiyan - as follows.</p>
<p>  "?.Varagunanaam thennavan eaththum Chitrambalaththaan?.."</p>
<p>  Thirukkovaiyaar - verse 306</p>
<p>  " ??puyaloangalar sadaiyettravan Chitrambalam pugalum mayal<br />  oangi irung khaliyaanai Varagunan 'vetpin vaiththa kayal' oangu <br />irung<br />  chilai kondu?."</p>
<p>  Thirukkovaiyaar - verse 327</p>
<p>  Note: The above reference goes to prove Varagunan (the Pandiyan <br />king)<br />  referred in Thirukkovaiyaar by Saint Maanikkavaasakar, was different<br />  from the Varaguna Pandiyan - 2 of (A.D.862 -880) and the Varaguna<br />  Pandiyan - 1 of (A.D.800-830), as the Inscriptions and other <br />historical<br />  and literary Documents on the latter two kings have not mentioned of<br />  they having carved the Pandiyan emblem the 'kayal fish' on the <br />Himalayan<br />  mountain (vetpin - on the mountain).</p>
<p>  Hence it is evident that the (earliest) Varagunan being that of<br />  Thirukkovaiyaar who possibly went on an expedition towards the <br />north of<br />  India, and carved the 'kayal fish' on the Himalayan mountain.</p>
<p>  Further though it is not specifically mentioned in Thirukkovaiyaar <br />that<br />  the mountain under reference was Himalayas, no Tamil kings be it <br />Chera,<br />  Chola or Pandiya would have ever considered it as a 'great pride' <br />to say<br />  that they carved their royal emblems on a mountain within Tamil <br />Nadu,<br />  instead of the great Himalayas as seen in many Tamil literary works <br />of<br />  the Sangam &amp; medieval periods.</p>
<p>  The scholar who highlighted this important reference in <br />Thirukkovaiyar<br />  'for the first time', was Dr.Sivapriya in her book titled<br />  the'Maanikkavaasakare koorum Maanikkavaasakarin varalaarum kaalamum'</p>
<p>  The fact the "Thirukkovaiyaar" too was composed by Saint<br />  Thiruvathavoorar is confirmed by Saint Nambiyaandaar Nambi as <br />follows.</p>
<p>  "?.varu vaasahaththin muttrunarntha thonai van Thillai mannai<br />  Thiruvaathavoor Siva Paaththiyaan sei Thirucitrambala<br />  porulaar thahu Thirukkovai kannde mattra porulai<br />  therulaatha ullaththavar kavi paadi sirippeere?."</p>
<p>  11th Thirumurai ? Koyil Thiruppanniyar Viruththam by Saint<br />  Nambiyaandaar Nambi ? verse 58</p>
<p>  Hence it is clear the Varaguna Pandiyan refered in the<br />  Thiruchitrambalakovaiyaar too like Saint Maanikkavaasaka Swamihal <br />lived<br />  before the Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar's year of birth A.D.568.</p>
<p>  A Sanskrit poetic work titled "Pandiya Kulothaya" too mentions of <br />the<br />  miracle of the foxes being transformed into horses during the time <br />of<br />  one "Vaathapuri Naayakar" meaning the Saint of Vaathapuri the <br />region of<br />  Thiruvaathavur. It also mentions the Pandiya king Varaguna Pandiyan <br />of<br />  that period who lost his kingdom to his brother met the Siva <br />Bakthar the<br />  Vaathapuri Naayakar and with his blessings he regained his kingdom <br />and<br />  continued to rule. It also states that Vaathapuri Naayaker served <br />later<br />  under this Pandiyan as his minister. There is also reference in <br />same to<br />  the miracle of foxes being transformed into horses,</p>
<p>  (Refer "Aaiyvu Katturaihal"- by Kudanthai N.Sethuraman page<br />  59-60)</p>
<p>  Further from the Tamil grammetical work titled "Kuvalayaanantham" <br />we get<br />  two further valuable informations as follows in it's `Sirrappu<br />  Paayiram'.</p>
<p>  "?thinakara meni Sivan upathesam manathinil unarntha<br />  Vaathavooraane?.."</p>
<p>  "??Kuvalayaanantham enum noolinai seithanan sahala kalayum<br />  therinththu valar Maanikkavaasakan enum gnana<br />  thesika sivayohiye mandalam sol Varaguna Pandiyan<br />  mun gnana maamaraiyor alangara vadasol ahak<br />  kondu iyalaal uraippathanaal Koodal vaalum<br />  Kottravan meena thuvasa kurusil nanpaaith<br />  than Thamilaal vilakkum ena, Vaathavooran<br />  saatrinaan vadamoliyaal thirinthu ulaavum<br />  enthisai en `Mimaangisai' enum noolin<br />  iyalbu anaiththum Kuvalayaaanantham entre?."</p>
<p>  "Kuvalayaanantham" ? published by Dr.S.V.Subramanian, Ulaha<br />  Thamilaratchi Niruvanam, Chennai.</p>
<p>  Hence from the Saint Thirunaavukkarasar's reference to the miracle<br />  in his Thevaram, and the references in the Kuvalayaanantham and <br />Pandiya<br />  Kulothaya to this same miracle, we can safely conclude the Saint<br />  Thiruvaathavoorar (also known as Saint Maanikkavaasakar in<br />  Kuvalayaanantham and Vaathapuri Nayakar in Pandiya Kulothaya), and <br />the<br />  Varaguna Pandiyan mentioned in latter two references, it is further<br />  confirmed that both lived before Saint Thirunaavukkarsu Naayanaar <br />that<br />  is before A.D. 568.</p>
<p>  The instance when Saint Thiruvathavoorar received a further name as<br />  Maanikkavaasagar is clearly stated in the two Tamil works named the<br />  "Thiruvilaiyadal Puraanam" and "Thiruvaathavoorar Puraanam", was at<br />  the occasion when he first started singing songs in praise of God <br />Siva<br />  composed of "jewel (Maanikkam) like sentences (Vaasakam)". This name<br />  Maanikkavaasakar later was shortened and also used as "Vaasakan" or<br />  "Vaasakar" to refer him.</p>
<p>  We now find two other instances where Saint Maanikkavaasakar has <br />been<br />  referred to by his short names, again in the Thevarems of the Saint<br />  Thirunaavukkarasar as follows.</p>
<p>  "??Kudamula Nanthi easanai Vaasakan aahak kondar?.."</p>
<p>  5th Thirumurai - Pathikam - 112, verse - 2</p>
<p>  "??Mangala Vaasakar kusaiyum angaiyit kosamum kondavar?.."</p>
<p>  5th Thirumurai - Pathikam - 34, verse - 9</p>
<p>  Saint Thirunaavukkarasar, too takes the period of the former as <br />earlier<br />  than A.D.568 the year of birth of the latter.</p>
<p>  The "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" of Paranjothi Munivar mentions that<br />  Saint Thiruvaathavoorar subsequently received the name <br />Maanikkavaasakar,<br />  and the ruling king during his time was Arimarthana Pandiyan.</p>
<p>  But the same "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" relates to a separate <br />event in<br />  respect of Varaguna Pandiyan as a Pandiyan who fought and won a <br />battle<br />  with Cholas. This from the history of the medieval Pandiyas we know <br />was<br />  the Vargunan - 2 (A.D.862-880). The "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" <br />doesnot<br />  associate him with Saint Maanikkavaasakar, or with the story of the<br />  miracle of foxes being transformed into horses.</p>
<p>  Hence the above gives us a hint that the Varaguna Pandiyan who won <br />the<br />  Cholas is the latter Varaguna Pandiyan - 2 (A.D.862-880), and the<br />  Pandiyan king who was living during the period of Saint <br />Maanikkavaasakar<br />  at the time of the miracle of foxes being transformed into horses <br />was a<br />  Pandiya king different to the Varaguna Pandiya - 2, whom it <br />mentions as<br />  Arimarthana Pandiyan.</p>
<p>  Hence from the references in the "Pandiya Kulothaya", <br />"Kuvalayaanantham"<br />  both of which mentions - of the miracle and the Varaguna Pandiyan <br />and<br />  the "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" which too mentions of this same <br />miracle<br />  but the Arimarthana Pandiyan, we could conclude the Pandiyan of that<br />  period as Arimarthanan aana Varaguna Pandiyan (Arimarthanan alias<br />  Varaguna Pandiyan) who was no doubt an earlier Pandiyan with the <br />same<br />  name Varagunan, and again reaffirm that he was quite different to <br />the<br />  Varaguna Pandiyan - 1 (A.D.800-830) and Varaguna Pandiyan - 2 <br />(A.D.862<br />  -880).</p>
<p>  Also it should be noted that there are no evidences or inscriptions <br />of<br />  Varaguna Pandiyan - 2 (A.D.862 -880) to confirm that the Saint <br />Vathapuri<br />  Nayager blessed him to get back his lost kingdom as per the "Pandiya<br />  Kulothaya" and that too from his own brother. Hence the reference in<br />  "Pandiya Kulothaya" must be to the Aritmarthanan aana Varaguna <br />Pandiyan<br />  of the earlier period.</p>
<p>  Further we have an interesting information in the Thiruvilaiyaadal<br />  Puraanam, that it was after eleven generations of Pandiyan kings <br />after<br />  Arimarthanan aana Varaguna Paandiyan came the Koon Pandiyan of the <br />Saint<br />  Thirugnanasampanthar period. If we take an average of 30 years for <br />each<br />  king's period of rule approximately, we note Arimarthana Pandiyan<br />  lived (30 x 11) three hundred and thirty years the before Pandiyan<br />  Nedumaran (also known as Koon Pandiyan), that is around A.D.312(642<br />  -330).</p>
<p>  Now referring to the religious work "Thiruvaasakam" of Saint<br />  Maanikkavaasagar, we note that there is hardly any reference to Jain<br />  religion in same, as compared to the Tamil "Thirumurai Thevarams" of<br />  other three great Saints, which refers to Jainism in many places as<br />  opposed to Saivaism. Hence we can be sure that Saint <br />Maanikkavaasakar<br />  lived during the period when Jainism has not yet gained much deep <br />roots<br />  in Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>  In the year A.D.350 a king from a ruling dynasty of Karnataka by the<br />  name Kalabhras (Kalappirar), invaded Tamil Nadu and Kerala and <br />defeated<br />  the Chola, Pandiya and Chera kings, and enforced their religion the<br />  Jainism that prevailed in a big way in Karnataka, into Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>  (Note: The year of Kalabhra invasion is as per the text "Life and<br />  Works of Buddagosha" by K.C.Law, extracted from "Pallavar<br />  Varalaaru" by Dr.M.Rasamanikkanar).</p>
<p>  This is confirmed by the following reference in in Tamil Saiva work<br />  titled "Kalladam"</p>
<p>  "??padai naangu udan Panchavan thuranthu Mathurai vaviya Karunada<br />  venthan<br />  Aruhar sarnthu nintru arutpani adaippa??."</p>
<p>  In the above Panchavan is the Pandiyan and "Karunada venthan" is the<br />  Kalabra king, and "Aruhar" are the followers of Jain religion.</p>
<p>  Kalaadam ? 57, lines 12-13</p>
<p>  This date of Kalabhra invasion looks realistic as we have <br />approximately<br />  determined the date of the Arimarthana Pandiyan around A.D.312, and<br />  possibly the Kalabhra invasion took place during the rule of his <br />son the<br />  Sakanaatha Pandiyan in A.D.350 who is known to us from the<br />  "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam".</p>
<p>  The Buddhism and Jainism had already spread to some extent in Tamil <br />Nadu<br />  earlier during the 3rd Sangam Period, but it was only after the <br />Kalabhra<br />  capture of Tamil Nadu the Jainsm became deeply rooted as a religion <br />of<br />  this region with the patronage of this king.</p>
<p>  Hence it is clear the period of Saint Maanikkavaasakar earlier<br />  determined as before A.D.568 the birth year of Saint <br />Thirunaavukkarasar,<br />  could now be pushed forward further to a period before A.D.350.</p>
<p>  Further from the early days of Tamil Nadu the "Saivaism<br />  religion" having "Siva Agamas" as their principal religious<br />  texts - long prevailed, and in the "Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam" we <br />are<br />  informed that Saint Maanikkavaasakar too was more interested in <br />learning<br />  the "Siva Agamas " in his youth.</p>
<p>  This may be the reason while Saint Thirugnanasampanthar, Saint<br />  Thirunaavukkarasar and Saint Sundaramoorththy Naayanar have <br />mentioned in<br />  many of their Thevaarems to the Vedas &amp; Vedism in addition to <br />Saivaism,<br />  Saint Maanikkavaasakar speaks more on Agamas and Saivaism than the <br />Vedas<br />  in his Thiruvaasakam. Vedism though was already in existance in <br />Tamil<br />  Nadu from the Sangam period, it became deeply rooted in Tamil Nadu <br />only<br />  during the period of Pallavas.</p>
<p>  Hence it is clear Saint Maanikkavaasakar lived before the invasion <br />of<br />  Tamil Nadu by Kalabhras around A.D.350, long before Jainism &amp; Vedism<br />  deeply rooted in Tamil Nadu during Kalabhra and Pallava periods.</p>
<p>  Further this conclusion is supported by another reference in the<br />  "Thiruvaasakam" by Saint Maanikkavaasakar as follows:</p>
<p>  ".....Mannan, pari misai vantha<br />  Vallal Perunthurai meya<br />  Thennavan, Cheralan, Cholan,<br />  seer Puyangan vara koovai....."</p>
<p>  Thiruvaasakam - 'Kuyit Paththu', verse 7</p>
<p>  In the above verse (in addition to all other verses) in the 'Kuyit<br />  Paththu' composed by Saint Maanikkavaasakar, he is asking the Cuckoo<br />  (Kuyil) to coo calling God Siva to (give vision to him), whom he<br />  describes as Mannan, Vallal, Thennavan(Pandiyan), Cheralan, Cholan <br />and<br />  Puyangan. Since he lived in a period before Kalabhra or Pallava <br />period<br />  he has made exemplary note to God Siva as the Thennavan, Cheralan, <br />and<br />  Cholan only.</p>
<p>  (Note: Should he have lived during the period of Varaguna Pandiyan <br />- 2<br />  or - 1 then possibly he would have also referred to the Kalabhra or<br />  Pallava too or instead, who were the leading ruling dynasties of <br />Tamil<br />  Nadu of that period)</p>
<p>  Now from a Copper Plate Grant that remained among the Christians of<br />  Kollam in Kerala State we note the following text..</p>
<p>  "?..After the royal punishment implemented against 72 - families of<br />  Vellalar of Kaviripoompattinam who believed and joined the Christian<br />  faith, they boarded a ship and went to the the place Kurakkeni <br />(Kollam)<br />  where the (other) Kurakkeni Christians too lived like relations in <br />the<br />  year A.D.293. The Christians from Niranam too (north of Kollam) <br />came to<br />  Kurakkeni and saw the Tamils there and followed few Tamil customs <br />and<br />  Malayalam customs and lived there.</p>
<p>  (During this time) the one who performed miracles (and) by the name<br />  Maanikkavaasakar met the Christians who came newly to this region, <br />by<br />  his miracles set the God he worshiped on them and caused fever,<br />  faintishness, and crippling of limbs, and killing the (domestic) <br />animals<br />  and those who became sick thus when they humbly meet him and receive<br />  holy ash (thiruneeru) and on applying they get cured (of sickness<br />)and<br />  rid off evil spirits.</p>
<p>  As it was a country of many Saaviya religion, those who respect him <br />on<br />  the sly take them to Maanikkavaasakar, and listen to Panchaakra<br />  (mantra), and on the sly give donations to temple, and going and <br />preying<br />  at temple festivals, and on the sly listening to the religious <br />stories<br />  and Kaaviyaas and Mantras.</p>
<p>  During this time the 24 families who came from Cholamandaam and the<br />  others who came and met Maannikkavaasagar and the 72 families gave <br />and<br />  got brides among their families and lived in unity. During that <br />time the<br />  72 families got together at the instance of the death of the leader <br />who<br />  took up the leadership and executed all assignments, 8 families <br />among<br />  the 72 families who got absorbed in the miracles of <br />Maanikkavaasakar and<br />  4 families who searched and met him and 20 families who were of this<br />  region in all 32 (families) 114 people met with one mind insisted <br />such a<br />  respectable leader's body to be covered with new cloth ans cremated.</p>
<p>  While the other 94 families in the Malayala 339 families, the <br />Kurakkeni<br />  Christians too from the time embraced the Christianity to this day<br />  insisted that the the body of the dead be covered in white cloth <br />and be<br />  buried in their (own) places, then the former (group) insisted they<br />  liked to hear the Guru Mantara of Panchakkara of their forefathers <br />and<br />  intake the Panchakavya of the cow dung, urine, milk, curd, ghee, <br />and if<br />  you do not listen to the words of Seedar (Sheeshayas)we 119 people <br />will<br />  leave your religion.</p>
<p>  And so saying openly approached Maanikkavaasakar and arranged to be <br />made<br />  the godly image of Maanikkavaasakar installed it at a region <br />(known) as<br />  the Panaiyin Naarukaa and called those families after <br />Mannikkavasakar as<br />  "Manigramakkaarar". Those who did not follow the guru mantra of<br />  Mannikkavasakar and apply the holy ash (being) 96 families jointly <br />used<br />  white cloth to cover dead bodies and buried within as practice they <br />were<br />  called the Christians??"</p>
<p>  (Translation into English of the Tamil version of the Copper Plates <br />from<br />  Thiruvananthapuram given in the book) - titled?.<br />  Maanikkavaasakar Peruman Varalaaru - by K. Subramaniyapillai.</p>
<p>  The above Copper Plate text mentions of one Maanikkavaasakar who<br />  performed miracles and who recited Panchaakkara (Panchaatchara) <br />Mantra</p></blockquote>
<p>clear</p>
<blockquote><p>  the Maanikkavasakar mentioned above was a Siva worshipper. Further <br />it is<br />  said the people of this country he met were mainly of the<br />  "Saaviya" (Saiva) religion. Hence the people of this region kept<br />  him in high reference and even made a godly image and worshipped. <br />From<br />  the foregoing we can safely conclude he could be no other than the <br />Saiva<br />  Saint Maanikkavaasakar.</p>
<p>  It is indicated in the Tamil translation that "?..72 - families of<br />  Vellalar of Kaviripoompattinam who believed and joined the Christian<br />  faith, they boarded a ship and went to the the place Kurakkeni <br />(Kollam)<br />  where the (other) Kurakkeni Christians too lived like relations in <br />the<br />  year A.D.293??".</p>
<p>  But on my reading of the original Tamil-Granthaha writing of the <br />Copper<br />  Plates, I find a date has been omitted in the Tamil translation <br />which<br />  when included reads as "?.in A.D.315 one who performed miracles<br />  (and) by the name Maanikkavaasakar?..", possibly visited<br />  (Kurakkeni) Kollam from Pandiya Nadu.</p>
<p>Saint<br />  Maanikkavasakar was 32 years.</p>
<p>  ".....Apparukku enbaththon(dru) arul Vaathavoorarukku<br />  seppiya naalettinil theiveekam - ippuviyil<br />  Sundararkku moovaaru thon Gnanasampantharkku<br />  antham pathinaaru ari......"</p>
<p>  Periyapuraanam - by Seakkeelaar, Thiruppananthaal Sri Kaasi Madam, <br />Sri<br />  Vaikuntham, Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>  We could reasonably expect him to have held the position of chief<br />  minister of the Pandiya king at an age of 24. He thereafter visited <br />many<br />  Saiva sacred places, and possibly towards the latter period of his <br />life<br />  time possibly around 30 years (A.D.315), he visted (Kurakkeni) <br />Kollam in<br />  Kerala.</p>
<p>  Hence we can conclude that the Tamil Saiva Saint Maanikkavaasakar <br />was<br />  born in A.D.285 (317-32) and demised in A.D.317 (315+2), before the<br />  period of Kalabra invasion around A.D.350 when Jainism has not <br />deeply<br />  rooted in TamilNadu, and at a period when Buddhism held a strong<br />  position in Tamil Nadu, and during the period of the Arimarthanan <br />alias<br />  Varuguna Pandiyan who has been establised as ruling around A.D.312, <br />at a<br />  time when Saivaism with Siva Agamas as their principal texts <br />prevailed<br />  along with other religions in Tamil Nadu, and at a period when the<br />  Christian faith too was gaining grounds in (Kurakkkeni) Kollam <br />Kerala<br />  (Chera Nadu) - a period long befor the Pallava rule in Tamil Nadu.</p>
