        <p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "R.venketesh"   veera saivism <br />is still prevalent in parts of karnataka.<br />===============</p>
<p>The NAGAPPA - Former Karnataka Minister - who was allegedly killed <br />after being kidnapped a couple of years - was a VEERA SAIVITE.<br />------------------------- </p>
<p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>To know certain basic details re temple practices in SAIVISM ::</p>
<p>PANCHAVARNA POOJAI :: ( 5 Sutru vazhipadu)</p>
<p>1. Lord Siva in Sanctum.<br />2. Thatpurushan - Agoran - Satyojathyan - Vamadevan - Easanan<br />3. Eight Vidyeswarars :: Nandhi - Mahakalan - Bringi - Ganapathy - <br />Murugan - Chandikeswaran - Ambal - Rishabam<br />4. Thikbala ( Directions )avaranam : Indiran - Agni - Yaman - <br />Niruthi - Varunan - Vaayu - Soman - Kuberan + Akasam / Sky <br />(Brahma) and Keezhthisai (thirumal @ Vishnu).<br />5. Ayutha Avaranam (Weapons of Respective deities).</p>
<p>Ref Appar VI Thirumurai - Thirupurambiyam</p>
<p>" ... KOVAYA INDIRAN ULLITTARAGA KUMARANUM VIGNAVINAYAGANUM<br />POOVALAYA PEEDATHU MEL AYANUM (Brahma) BOOMIYALANDANUM (Thruvikraman)<br />POTRISAIPPA... "</p>
<p>Ref V Thirumurai Thiruppovanur ::</p>
<p>" ... NARANAN NAANMUGAN INDIRAN VAARANAN KUMARAN VANANGUM KAZHAL<br />POORANAN THIRUPOOVANUR MEVIYA KAARANAN .."</p>
<p>There are several quotes..</p>
<p>The Deiteis Siva - Vishnu - Brahma were coexisted and co-worshipped <br />in all the siva temples as could be seen from Thavaram hymns..</p>
<p>Sekkizhar hymned PERIYAPURANAM during Anabaya Kulothunga II period..<br />and was revered by all..</p>
<p>This should have prompted various IDAICHERUGALs in Literatures etc., <br />to caste shadow on the Kings / Saints at later point of time.</p>
<p>We have already clarified that CHITRAKUDAM was a place of worship <br />using Paadagam (Painted Narayan image on clothes) which got <br />detoriated over a period of time and that was submerged in the Sea <br />with reverence during Kulothunga period ..</p>
<p>When a Ramar Bronze was found ( recently )about 100 years back in a <br />village named as THILLAI VILAGAM (near Thiruvarur ) (Pls ref <br />Archieves again) it was postulated whether Thillai vilagam - <br />Chitrakoodam was associated with Lord Rama (of this Thillai vilagam -<br />near Thiruvarur)!</p>

<p>  if kamal can arrange some connectivity between a 12th century start<br />  and a 21st century finish it would be really good.<br />  but then this story too went to court remember. kamal was accused of<br />  plagiarism</p></blockquote>

<p>    I don't want to comment on Kalaignar much.</p>
<p>    Kamal, now yes, he tries to innovte, bring new<br />    ideas/thoughts into movies. He is by no means a mature<br />    intellectual, only seems to try often times in half<br />    baked ways.</p>
<p>    In our hero worshipping culture many people think this<br />    guy is more than he is, that is more of their fault<br />    than his that is all.</p>
<p>    --- ma eswaran <maeswaran@...  wrote:</p>
<p>       I just saw Kalaignar's note about the first scene.<br />      He<br />      mentions that<br />       the Chola king asked Ramanjuar to not tell<br />      "Narayana"<br />       and asked him to<br />       say "Shiva"</p>
<p>      During that function of audio release Kalaignar was<br />      telling that "one has to be firm in his stand in the<br />      life whatever may come" referring to what Ramanujar<br />      refused to say siva?. Kamal was also nodding his<br />      head<br />      to his statement.</p>
<p>      I just could not hide my laughs at these two<br />      gentlemen.</p>
<p>      1) Kalaignar including his party gave up their stand</p>
<p>      for separate Dravida nadu to stand in the election<br />      in<br />      the 50s. Their stand on "politics" is well known</p>
<p>      2)Kamal's stand on the term of "marriage" changes<br />      frequently</p>

        <p>If we really believe in being open minded we should<br />not call iyengars participating in shiva worship as<br />'generosity' in any way. </p>
<p>The correlation of iyers/iyengars to<br />shaivites/vaishavities is tied down to casteism - like<br />Venkat said Lingayats in Karnataka are veera shaivas,<br />there are veera vaishavaas among people in Andhra too,<br />they are not iyers or iyengars.</p>
<p>To me just thinking we have to have all these borders<br />and restrictions and 'respect' those who believe them<br />is itself our unwillingness to acknoweldge that it is<br />wrong to divide God in this way. </p>
<p>I am sorry for sounding strong on the subject.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Very informative discussions and quite interesting.</p>
<p>  The marking of sanku and chakkaram...I think they<br />  call it also as 'deekshai'.. am i right?</p>
<p>  Its good to know that reason for people not going to<br />  Siva temple just because of the <br />  loyalty and nothing else. Is this applicable to<br />  people only who take deeksha or all the <br />  vaishnavites? why I am asking this is,people who<br />  dont take deekshai also dont go to siva <br />  temple. This is not generalized as I know iyengars<br />  generously participating in siva <br />  worship. But there are other kind of people too....<br />  recently a group of iyengars went on a <br />  trip to Badri but they didnt go to Kedar. I really<br />  appreciated their devotion but at the same <br />  time wondering how can they do it? As discussed,<br />  its upto the individual preference and <br />  should not be questions.So lets leave it there.</p>
<p>  In PS Kalki says that saivam and vaishnavam was not<br />  like the current day practice, where a <br />  family will be totally saivam or vaishnavam..A<br />  person can be a strong saivite, and his <br />  brother can be a staunch viashnavite.. But later<br />  days it changed. I think its true.</p>
<p>  We know a family where one is a saivite and his<br />  co-brother was a vaishnavite. when we <br />  built a temple in our area in 1993, when the saivite<br />  donated the whole shrine of Siva, just <br />  for competition his co-brother said he will build<br />  the entire vishnu shrine. this competition <br />  helped the area vasis ultimately :)</p>
<p>  Also, there is an understanding that in brahmins<br />  iyers are saivites and iyengars are <br />  vaishnavites. Iyengars being vaishnavites is<br />  accepted. But iyers being saivites is not.<br />  Kanchi maha periyava clarified that people who<br />  follow sanakara bagavad padal (those who <br />  are considered to be saivites) are not saivites, but<br />  smarthas.</p>
<p>  smartha means those who accept advaitam and in<br />  advaitam there is no supremacy of one <br />  god over other. so there is no question of following<br />  siva or vishnu and consider all the <br />  gods are ONE.</p>
<p>  But the current day understanding is quite<br />  different. </p>
<p>  Coming back to Dasavatharam, given the hype I am<br />  very much eager to watch this. It <br />  should not sothapify as any other kamal movie which<br />  comes with a hype.</p>

<p>  The study of Srngam epigraphs of the time of Kulothunga-I clearly<br />  and in unmistakable terms show the personal interest of the king in<br />  the temple, the devotion of the king , the queens and their<br />  endowments, the provisions for the recitation of Thiruvaimozhi<br />  twice in the same reign, the endowments of flower gardens, the <br />  reclamation<br />  of silted lands, institution of festivals etc., show a period of<br />  great activity in the temple, and its prosperous condition, which is<br />  totally at variance with the Ramanuja legend. </p>

<p>  ------------------------------------<br />  I have ADDED through my earlier mail in MSG 13499 posted on  <br />  01.09.2006 :</p>
<p>  SPS WROTE (13499 dt: 01.09.2006)<br />  PRANAMS TO SAINT SRI RAMANUJAR.</p>
<p>  2. NARASIMHA SWAMY WAS THE KULADEYVAM of KULOTHUNGA I ..... !<br />  ------------- as could be seen by ENNAYIRAM INSCRIPTION :</p>
<p>  KULOTHINGA's inscription in his 41st year which is VERY<br />  IMPORTANT :<br />  THRIBUVANACHAKRAVARTHIYIN K-U-L-A-D-E-Y-V-A-M-A-N-A AZHAGIYA<br />  NARASIMHA PERUMAL THIRUKKOIYILIL DEYVA PRADISTAIYUM,<br />  JALAPRADISTAIYUM SEYDARULINAR. HE performed this on the eve of<br />  commencing war against Kalingam !<br />  =================================<br />  This information is also furnished by<br />  Pacnahjanyam, Shree Vaishnavashree A. Krishnamachariar, Srirangam. <br />  ( Pls write to him to get details of Panchajanyam monthly issue.)</p>
<p>  Kulothunga I ruled from 1070 to 1122 AD with Vikramachozhan<br />  overlapping 1118 to 1135 AD. Vikrama's 13th year is AD 1130. There<br />  were grants almost every year and in 1140 AD there was a grant by<br />  Kulothunga II.as well.</p>
<p>  It is evidenced that during the 120 years of lifetime of Sri<br />  Ramanujar uninterruptedly Chozha dynasty has given grants to<br />  Srirangam temple as could be seen from more 120 inscriptions ..</p>
<p>  ENNAYIRAM : Our members are familiar with this place. On our trip<br />  to Thanjavur, we got down about 10 Km after Tindivanam and found a<br />  recent stone pointing the direction of Ennayiram :: Kavi<br />  Kalamegam's birth place. There are stories that 8000 Jains were<br />  put on Kazhu.</p>
<p>  Another story that Ashta Saharsra Brahmins hail from this place.<br />  however as desired by SARVA SIVA PNDITHAR - GURU OF RAJENDRA I - a<br />  Siva temple was constructed .. nearby place is Esalam where copper<br />  plates confirming that Aditha Karikalan put Veerpandian's head at<br />  the Fort Entrance of Thanjai was found about 20 years back...<br />  -------------------------<br />  " Pillailogam Jeeyar" in his "Ramanujarya Divya Satidhai"<br />  mentioned<br />  that Udayavar (Sri Ramanujar)has visited Thirumalai thrice and<br />  each time he did not fail to visit Thirukkaoilore "Idaikkazhi<br />  Naayanar".<br />  -----------------<br />  ENNAYIRATHU ECHCHAN a devotee of Udayavar was ordered certain<br />  disciplines : Washing THIRUPPARIYATTAM - clothings of Sree<br />  Viahsnavite devotees (like Meykandar - Sivanadiayar of Nallur! -<br />  Actor Nagesh did this role well in Thiruvilayadal movie). From<br />  Thirukkoilore he went to Ennayiram and Blessed Ennayirathu Echchan.</p>
<p>  During Sri Ramanurjar's 120 yr life time (1017 - 1136) Rajendra I</p>
<p>  1012 - 1044) Rajendra II (1052 - 1064) Rajamahendran (1059 - 1062)<br />  veerarajendran (1063 - 1070), Adhirajendran (1068 - 1071)<br />  Kulothubnga I (1070 - 1122), Vikrama chozhan (1118 - 1135) and<br />  Kulothunga II (1133 to 1150) - EIGHT Chozha Kings were in Power.</p>
<p>  RRC (985 - 1014) established RAJARAJA CHARUTVEDI MANGALAM which<br />  included Ennayiram. In Ennayiram, AZHAGIYA NARASIMHA PERUMAL<br />  (VINNAGARM) was constructed.</p>
<p>  1. ARE 335 of 1917 Rajendra I - 25th yr : the income of the temple<br />  lands should be shared by (1) Moolasthanam udayar temple (2)<br />  Rajaraja Vinnagara Azhwar @ NARASIMHA PERUMAL VINNAGARAM (3)<br />  KUNDAVAI VINNAGARAM (Recall Ponniyinselvan !) @ DADAPURAM<br />  KARIVARADHA PERUMAL TEMPLE and (4) SUNDARA CHOZHA VINNAGARAM. Also<br />  daily poojas of Surya .. sapthamatrika .. saastha.. Gramadevathas<br />  etc., need to be performed ..</p>
<p>  2. ARE 341 of 1917: Rajendra I - 30th yr : Aippasi Sadhayam and<br />  Maasi Punarvasu (?) Vizha..</p>
<p>  3. ARE 333 of 1917 : Rajendra I - 45 Veli grant for practicising<br />  Thiruvaymozhi, Vedas, Vyakranas, Vedantha and Meemasa sastras..<br />  Four persons appointed to hymn Thiruvaymozhi daily.. 3 kuruni nel<br />  25 Shree vaishanas fed daily.. Aani Anusham Seven day festival.<br />  60 kalam nel. 3 kazhanju gold for 1000 Shree Vaishnavites. Beggers<br />  given food and clothes. There was a Vedapadasala in Gangaikonda<br />  Chozhan mandapam where 270 Brahmacharis studied and were given 6<br />  naazhi nel daily basis. Teachers given 10506 kalam nel.. 8<br />  kazhanju for those who taught 8 sargas and 12 for those who taught <br />12<br />  sargas.</p>
<p>  4. ARE 347 of 1917 : On Sreejayanthi (Lord Krishna's birthday ) -<br />  Convocation - each successful student was awarded Gold Ring and<br />  Golden Lotus! Long lists of grants and receivables;   <br />  5. ARE 330 of 1917 - Rajadirajan I - Kadaitharam - Least taxing..</p>
<p>  6. ARE 340 of 1947 - KULOTHUNGA I - 7th year - Grant of Cows for<br />  burning perpetual lamps.</p>
<p>  7. ARE 344 of 1947 - KULOTHUNGA I - 39th year - 50th day :: Under<br />  the auspicious of Puliyur (Our Kodambakkam) Verkkadu Kulothunga<br />  Moovenda velalan PERFORMED TEMPLE RENOVATION, TANK FORMED AND<br />  SAMPROKSHANAM !</p>
<p>  ARE 333 of 1917 mentions of similar Samprokshnam by Rajendra I<br />  earlier.</p>
<p>  There are grants from RAJRAJA II (326 OF 1917) and VEERARAJENDRAN<br />  (345 OF 1917).</p>
<p>  (Ennayiram) Narasimha Perumal was considered KULADEYVAM of<br />  KULOTHUNGA I... as seen from the above inscriptions ..<br />  =====================<br />  Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  the INSCRIPTIONAL RECORDS are CONTEMPORARY... Scribed in respective <br />  years .. Meaning Kulothunga I 's regime, Kulothunga II's regime etc.</p>
<p>  " The Guruparambara " details are certainly later to these ..</p>
<p>  PLS CONFIRM WHETHER THESE DETAILS PROVIDE THAT KULOTHUNGA WAS <br />  DEVOTEE OF NARASIMHA SWAMY WHICH WAS HIS KULA DEYVAM !</p>
<p>  We may have to reconsider several things in the light of the above.</p>

<p>------------------------------------<br />I have ADDED through my earlier mail in MSG 13499 posted on  <br />01.09.2006 :</p>
<p>SPS WROTE (13499 dt: 01.09.2006)<br />PRANAMS TO SAINT SRI RAMANUJAR.</p>
<p>2. NARASIMHA SWAMY WAS THE KULADEYVAM of KULOTHUNGA I ..... !<br />------------- as could be seen by ENNAYIRAM INSCRIPTION :</p>
<p>KULOTHINGA's inscription in his 41st year which is VERY<br />IMPORTANT :<br />THRIBUVANACHAKRAVARTHIYIN K-U-L-A-D-E-Y-V-A-M-A-N-A AZHAGIYA<br />NARASIMHA PERUMAL THIRUKKOIYILIL DEYVA PRADISTAIYUM,<br />JALAPRADISTAIYUM SEYDARULINAR. HE performed this on the eve of<br />commencing war against Kalingam !<br />=================================<br />This information is also furnished by<br />Pacnahjanyam, Shree Vaishnavashree A. Krishnamachariar, Srirangam. <br />( Pls write to him to get details of Panchajanyam monthly issue.)</p>
<p>Kulothunga I ruled from 1070 to 1122 AD with Vikramachozhan<br />overlapping 1118 to 1135 AD. Vikrama's 13th year is AD 1130. There<br />were grants almost every year and in 1140 AD there was a grant by<br />Kulothunga II.as well.</p>
<p>It is evidenced that during the 120 years of lifetime of Sri<br />Ramanujar uninterruptedly Chozha dynasty has given grants to<br />Srirangam temple as could be seen from more 120 inscriptions ..</p>
<p>ENNAYIRAM : Our members are familiar with this place. On our trip<br />to Thanjavur, we got down about 10 Km after Tindivanam and found a<br />recent stone pointing the direction of Ennayiram :: Kavi<br />Kalamegam's birth place. There are stories that 8000 Jains were<br />put on Kazhu.</p>
<p>Another story that Ashta Saharsra Brahmins hail from this place.<br />however as desired by SARVA SIVA PNDITHAR - GURU OF RAJENDRA I - a<br />Siva temple was constructed .. nearby place is Esalam where copper<br />plates confirming that Aditha Karikalan put Veerpandian's head at<br />the Fort Entrance of Thanjai was found about 20 years back...<br />-------------------------<br />" Pillailogam Jeeyar" in his "Ramanujarya Divya Satidhai"<br />mentioned<br />that Udayavar (Sri Ramanujar)has visited Thirumalai thrice and<br />each time he did not fail to visit Thirukkaoilore "Idaikkazhi<br />Naayanar".<br />-----------------<br />ENNAYIRATHU ECHCHAN a devotee of Udayavar was ordered certain<br />disciplines : Washing THIRUPPARIYATTAM - clothings of Sree<br />Viahsnavite devotees (like Meykandar - Sivanadiayar of Nallur! -<br />Actor Nagesh did this role well in Thiruvilayadal movie). From<br />Thirukkoilore he went to Ennayiram and Blessed Ennayirathu Echchan.</p>
<p>During Sri Ramanurjar's 120 yr life time (1017 - 1136) Rajendra I</p>
<p>1012 - 1044) Rajendra II (1052 - 1064) Rajamahendran (1059 - 1062)<br />veerarajendran (1063 - 1070), Adhirajendran (1068 - 1071)<br />Kulothubnga I (1070 - 1122), Vikrama chozhan (1118 - 1135) and<br />Kulothunga II (1133 to 1150) - EIGHT Chozha Kings were in Power.</p>

<p>There are grants from RAJRAJA II (326 OF 1917) and VEERARAJENDRAN<br />(345 OF 1917).</p>
<p>(Ennayiram) Narasimha Perumal was considered KULADEYVAM of<br />KULOTHUNGA I... as seen from the above inscriptions ..<br />=====================<br />Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>the INSCRIPTIONAL RECORDS are CONTEMPORARY... Scribed in respective <br />years .. Meaning Kulothunga I 's regime, Kulothunga II's regime etc.</p>
<p>" The Guruparambara " details are certainly later to these ..</p>
<p>PLS CONFIRM WHETHER THESE DETAILS PROVIDE THAT KULOTHUNGA WAS <br />DEVOTEE OF NARASIMHA SWAMY WHICH WAS HIS KULA DEYVAM !</p>
<p>We may have to reconsider several things in the light of the above.</p>

        <p>Hi Sathish</p>
<p>veera saivism is still prevalent in parts of karnataka.<br />here in tamilnadu i think thirupati settled the issue for shavaites.<br />no more 'shiva temple only' shaivaites here.</p>
<p>i know muslims, buddhists and jains visiting tirupathi. its just <br />phenomenal.<br />when ranganathar and govindarajar seek his solace why not mortals.<br />venketesh</p>

<blockquote><p>  Very informative discussions and quite interesting.</p>
<p>  The marking of sanku and chakkaram...I think they call it also as <br />'deekshai'.. am i right?</p>
<p>  Its good to know that reason for people not going to Siva temple <br />just because of the <br />  loyalty and nothing else. Is this applicable to people only who <br />take deeksha or all the <br />  vaishnavites? why I am asking this is,people who dont take deekshai <br />also dont go to siva <br />  temple. This is not generalized as I know iyengars generously <br />participating in siva <br />  worship. But there are other kind of people too.... recently a <br />group of iyengars went on a <br />  trip to Badri but they didnt go to Kedar. I really appreciated <br />their devotion but at the same <br />  time wondering how can they do it? As discussed, its upto the <br />individual preference and <br />  should not be questions.So lets leave it there.</p>
<p>  In PS Kalki says that saivam and vaishnavam was not like the <br />current day practice, where a <br />  family will be totally saivam or vaishnavam..A person can be a <br />strong saivite, and his <br />  brother can be a staunch viashnavite.. But later days it changed. I <br />think its true.</p>
<p>  We know a family where one is a saivite and his co-brother was a <br />vaishnavite. when we <br />  built a temple in our area in 1993, when the saivite donated the <br />whole shrine of Siva, just <br />  for competition his co-brother said he will build the entire vishnu <br />shrine. this competition <br />  helped the area vasis ultimately :)</p>
<p>  Also, there is an understanding that in brahmins iyers are saivites <br />and iyengars are <br />  vaishnavites. Iyengars being vaishnavites is accepted. But iyers <br />being saivites is not.<br />  Kanchi maha periyava clarified that people who follow sanakara <br />bagavad padal (those who <br />  are considered to be saivites) are not saivites, but smarthas.</p>
<p>  smartha means those who accept advaitam and in advaitam there is no <br />supremacy of one <br />  god over other. so there is no question of following siva or vishnu <br />and consider all the <br />  gods are ONE.</p>
<p>  But the current day understanding is quite different. </p>
<p>  Coming back to Dasavatharam, given the hype I am very much eager to <br />watch this. It <br />  should not sothapify as any other kamal movie which comes with a <br />hype.</p>

<PRE I remember reading a story on this, don't know where,<br />possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.<br /><br />A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />better, naamam or thiruneeru. The vaishavite wants to<br />take down al lthe horizontal bricks from the house<br />they are in in defence of the argument. The shaivite<br />does the opposite and removes vertical. Finally there<br />is no house left.<br /><br />This is a century old argument, and ridiculous<br />argument in my opinion. Like the Annamarcharya kirtan<br />rendered in MSS's melodious voice Entha maatramuna<br />evvaaru thalachina antha mathrame neevu - whatever<br />ways devotees seek you, you are that.<br /><br />--- Rahul dhinakaran &lt;rahul.dhinakaran@gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br /><br />&gt; Mr.Venketesh (vinjamoor_venketesh, this is getting<br />&gt; crazy :) )<br />&gt; You writings are very informative. Have you written<br />&gt; in this group before? If<br />&gt; so im sorry, i must have missed the mails. Do keep<br />&gt; this going.<br />&gt; If these are your first mails then i presume on<br />&gt; seeing this topic the<br />&gt; Vaishnavite in you just came out screaming (no<br />&gt; offence, just a joke).<br />&gt; This happens when my father and my family friend<br />&gt; (the one i was talking<br />&gt; about earlier) start having a chat about thier visit<br />&gt; to the meenakshi<br />&gt; temple. This family friend (im delibrately<br />&gt; refraining from naming him)<br />&gt; doesn't go into the Sivan sannidhi. My father, being<br />&gt; a Saivite (not fanatic,<br />&gt; we visit Srirangam too), starts the arguement and it<br />&gt; keeps continuing.<br />&gt; For an arguement and topic which has been going on<br />&gt; for more than 10<br />&gt; centuries i think it remains incredibly fresh.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I just wanted to convey this, this is also a pretty<br />&gt; sensitive topic hence i<br />&gt; request our members to tread VERY carefully and<br />&gt; refrain from hurting<br />&gt; another's feelings. In the name of democracy and<br />&gt; openess of society we seem<br />&gt; to take too much of a liberty. Sometimes an iron<br />&gt; hand is required so i<br />&gt; request our moderators to keep a watch on these<br />&gt; threads and mercilessy<br />&gt; delete any mails which might seem offensive.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Regards<br />&gt; Rahul<br />&gt; <br />&gt; On 5/3/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh<br />&gt; &lt;vinjamoor_venkatesh@yahoo.com&gt; wrote:<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mr Venketesh<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial<br />&gt; debate going on<br />&gt; &gt; between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The<br />&gt; thenkalais claim that<br />&gt; &gt; vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only<br />&gt; after Ramanuja, but<br />&gt; &gt; only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in<br />&gt; the Guruparampara.<br />&gt; &gt; The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated<br />&gt; from Pillai<br />&gt; &gt; Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This debate will never end as both are not ready<br />&gt; to accept the<br />&gt; &gt; other's views. Let us leave it at that. However,<br />&gt; if one enters into a<br />&gt; &gt; philosophical debate, I had recently written a<br />&gt; small writeup<br />&gt; &gt; regarding this kalai differences in one of the<br />&gt; personal mails on that<br />&gt; &gt; debate. If members are willing, I can share it<br />&gt; here. Ofcourse, it is<br />&gt; &gt; subject to a debate.<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived<br />&gt; for 120 years. He<br />&gt; &gt; attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These<br />&gt; are the timelines<br />&gt; &gt; which all the historians accept unopposed.<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no<br />&gt; link to the<br />&gt; &gt; Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />&gt; happened later, though<br />&gt; &gt; within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in<br />&gt; saying that<br />&gt; &gt; Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />&gt; from the sea and got<br />&gt; &gt; it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty<br />&gt; sure, how he was<br />&gt; &gt; reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />&gt; somewhere (may be in<br />&gt; &gt; this group itself) that He was reinstated during<br />&gt; the times of Nayak<br />&gt; &gt; kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of<br />&gt; Chitrakoodam.<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />&gt; neither acting as<br />&gt; &gt; Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest<br />&gt; of the Temple of<br />&gt; &gt; Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />&gt; mention in the<br />&gt; &gt; history.<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,<br />&gt; &gt; Venkatesh<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a><br />&gt; &lt;ponniyinselvan%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,<br />&gt; &gt; "R.venketesh" &lt;abhivencat@...&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; so many venkatesh's in the group now.<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i have seen the tatooing( or branding)<br />&gt; instruments used on ramanuja<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; himself(???) in mathuranthakam temple. they were<br />&gt; discovered in a<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; secret chamber in the last decade<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So if he still has taken such a<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; scene<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like King asking Ramanuja instead of<br />&gt; Koorathazhwan to recite the<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; verses,<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This person im talking about also has the<br />&gt; tatoo (or is it<br />&gt; &gt; burned<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; skin?

        <p>Rahul, I can stand him quite well :) I respect his<br />acting skills tremendously, i think he has great<br />talent, and he seems to be a kind hearted humanitarian<br />too who discouraged hero worship and ecourages social<br />work.</p>
<p>He is not some intellectual trying to teach us ways to<br />live. All his views on athiesm, marriage etc are his<br />own views, not something people should look upto and<br />learn from.

<p>  I think Mr.Venketesh (the author, there are too many<br />  venketesh's here :)<br />  ) is right. Kamal just plays a priest in the temple<br />  who is thrown along with<br />  the idol into the ocean. Im sure the movie would<br />  answer some of these<br />  questions.</p>

<p>    if kamal can arrange some connectivity between a<br />  12th century start<br />    and a 21st century finish it would be really good.<br />    but then this story too went to court remember.<br />  kamal was accused of<br />    plagiarism</p>

<p>      I don't want to comment on Kalaignar much.</p>
<p>      Kamal, now yes, he tries to innovte, bring new<br />      ideas/thoughts into movies. He is by no means a<br />  mature<br />      intellectual, only seems to try often times in<br />  half<br />      baked ways.</p>

<p>         I just saw Kalaignar's note about the first<br />  scene.<br />        He<br />        mentions that<br />         the Chola king asked Ramanjuar to not tell<br />        "Narayana"<br />         and asked him to<br />         say "Shiva"</p>
<p>        During that function of audio release<br />  Kalaignar was<br />        telling that "one has to be firm in his stand<br />  in the<br />        life whatever may come" referring to what<br />  Ramanujar<br />        refused to say siva?. Kamal was also nodding<br />  his<br />        head<br />        to his statement.</p>
<p>        I just could not hide my laughs at these two<br />        gentlemen.</p>
<p>        1) Kalaignar including his party gave up their<br />  stand</p>
<p>        for separate Dravida nadu to stand in the<br />  election<br />        in<br />        the 50s. Their stand on "politics" is well<br />  known</p>
<p>        2)Kamal's stand on the term of "marriage"<br />  changes<br />        frequently</p>

        <p>I remember reading a story on this, don't know where,<br />possibly Kalki but could be someone else too.</p>
<p>A Shaivite and Vaishavite are arguing on which is<br />better, naamam or thiruneeru. The vaishavite wants to<br />take down al lthe horizontal bricks from the house<br />they are in in defence of the argument. The shaivite<br />does the opposite and removes vertical. Finally there<br />is no house left.</p>
<p>This is a century old argument, and ridiculous<br />argument in my opinion. Like the Annamarcharya kirtan<br />rendered in MSS's melodious voice Entha maatramuna<br />evvaaru thalachina antha mathrame neevu - whatever<br />ways devotees seek you, you are that.</p>

<p>    The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial<br />  debate going on<br />    between both the sects of Srivaishnavism.

If members are willing, I can share it<br />  here. Ofcourse, it is<br />    subject to a debate.</p>
<p>    Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived<br />  for 120 years. He<br />    attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These<br />  are the timelines<br />    which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>    Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no<br />  link to the<br />    Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have<br />  happened later, though<br />    within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in<br />  saying that<br />    Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam<br />  from the sea and got<br />    it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty<br />  sure, how he was<br />    reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read<br />  somewhere (may be in<br />    this group itself) that He was reinstated during<br />  the times of Nayak<br />    kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of<br />  Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>    Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is<br />  neither acting as<br />    Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest<br />  of the Temple of<br />    Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no<br />  mention in the<br />    history.</p>

<p>      i have seen the tatooing( or branding)<br />  instruments used on ramanuja<br />      himself(???) in mathuranthakam temple. they were<br />  discovered in a<br />      secret chamber in the last decade</p>
<p>      .     So if he still has taken such a<br />      scene<br />        like King asking Ramanuja instead of<br />  Koorathazhwan to recite the<br />        verses,</p>
<p>          This person im talking about also has the<br />  tatoo (or is it<br />    burned<br />        into the<br />          skin? Can somebody confirm this?) on his<br />  bicep.</p>
<p>      rahul , kamal also had a thenkalai naamam(<br />  straight lined like a<br />      trident rather than the U of vadakalai)</p>
<p>      but one doubt??<br />      didnt vadakalai originate after ramanuja??? then<br />  how does he do<br />    this<br />      say some 50 years prior?</p>
<p>      can sps clarify the timelines of</p>
<p>      a. ramanuja<br />      b. the chitrakootam incident of govindarajar and<br />  the sea dropping.</p>
<p>      isnt there a prevalent story that ramanuja<br />  recovered it and placed<br />      it in kizh tirupathi?????</p>

<p>      They are not<br />        allowed to have<br />          a moustache/beard too.

<p>          Well, that was a really confusing statement from MK.<br />  Actually<br />      according<br />          to the Srivaishnavite Guruparampara which talks about the<br />    stories<br />      of<br />          all the Acharyas of Srivaishnavism starting from Nathamuni<br />  until<br />          Manavalamamuni, it is not Ramanuja who was asked by the Chola<br />      King to<br />          recite Siva's name as supreme.</p>
<p>          The story goes thus: (As taken from the book "Guruparampara<br />      Prabhavam")</p>
<p>          ..... Once when Ramanuja was away from his mutt, at Kaveri<br />  for<br />    his<br />          bath, the soldiers of the Chola King came to his mutt and<br />      informed that<br />          the King has ordained Ramanuja to court. Knowing well about<br />  the<br />          Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, the<br />      foremost<br />          disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome of<br />  the<br />          meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya<br />  and<br />      hence he<br />          silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along with<br />      Periya<br />          Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the<br />  Chola<br />      King in<br />          the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other disciples<br />  of<br />          Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and asked<br />    them<br />      to<br />          prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though<br />    Ramanuja<br />      did<br />          not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that<br />    Koorathazhwan<br />      has<br />          already left in disguise, and also giving in to the pressure<br />  by<br />      his<br />          other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of<br />  his<br />      Acharya<br />          (Periya Nambi) and his Sishya (Koorathazhwan), left for<br />  Melkote<br />    in<br />          present day Karnataka.</p>
<p>          Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However,<br />  there<br />      was a<br />          minister by name "Naalooran" in King's court, who was once<br />      supposed to<br />          have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately identified<br />    him<br />          (traditional accounts vary from calling this act as treachery<br />    to<br />      utmost<br />          concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth yet to<br />  be<br />          deciphered) as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained<br />      Koorathazhwan to<br />          write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The<br />      wording that<br />          Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam<br />    nAsthi".<br />          Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course<br />    Koorathazhwan<br />      did<br />          write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi thatha<br />      param".<br />          Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than 'sivam". In older<br />  days<br />      the<br />          words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. drONam<br />    was<br />      larger<br />          in measurement than sivam.</p>
<p>          On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and asked<br />    the<br />      eyes<br />          of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya Nambi.<br />      However<br />          Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my<br />  eyes.<br />    I<br />      will<br />          do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" and<br />      plucks it<br />          himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the pain.</p>
<p>          This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete screw-<br />  up<br />    in<br />      the<br />          screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true.<br />    However<br />      we<br />          cannot conclude until the movie is out and we see it for<br />      ourselves.</p>

        <p>Hi<br />the way kamal ties his long hair in the trailor is so similar to his <br />appearance in "Hey ram"-<br />hey ram by the way is a lift off from a chapter in khuswant singhs <br />delhi( in my opinion one of the best historical novels ever written)</p>

        <p>Absolutely true...</p>
<p>Thillai incident doesn?t have any connection with that of Kurathazvan incident... as the later incident took place some where near sri rangam, and very much before the Thillai incident<br />And lord Govindarajar was established in kizh tirupathi...By this time Sri.Ramanujar was very old... Some where nearing his 100s.. and it was one of shiyas or nambis who went along with the Govindarajar into the sea.. Thirupathi as a whole used to be domicile for all our lords from down south, weather its muslim invasion or internal problems.... be it Lord Sri Ranganatha..or Govindharajar...  <br />some body was asking about astaksharam.. the same refers to the name of thelord "om namo narayanaya"... this the one mentioned in the dasavatharam song... <br />and this is manthra which sri ramanujar gave into the whole world going on the top of the temple announcing the same to the whole world.. The way to get moksha even if he goes to hell...</p>

<p>Mr Venketesh</p>
<p>The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial debate going on <br />between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The thenkalais claim that <br />vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only after Ramanuja, but <br />only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in the Guruparampara. <br />The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated from Pillai <br />Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.</p>
<p>This debate will never end as both are not ready to accept the <br />other's views. Let us leave it at that. However, if one enters into a <br />philosophical debate, I had recently written a small writeup <br />regarding this kalai differences in one of the personal mails on that <br />debate. If members are willing, I can share it here. Ofcourse, it is <br />subject to a debate.</p>
<p>Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived for 120 years. He <br />attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These are the timelines <br />which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no link to the <br />Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have happened later, though <br />within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in saying that <br />Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam from the sea and got <br />it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty sure, how he was <br />reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read somewhere (may be in <br />this group itself) that He was reinstated during the times of Nayak <br />kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is neither acting as <br />Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest of the Temple of <br />Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no mention in the <br />history. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi<br />  so many venkatesh's in the group now.</p>
<p>  i have seen the tatooing( or branding) instruments used on ramanuja <br />  himself(???) in mathuranthakam temple. they were discovered in a <br />  secret chamber in the last decade</p>
<p>  .     So if he still has taken such a <br />  scene <br />    like King asking Ramanuja instead of Koorathazhwan to recite the <br />    verses, </p>
<p>      This person im talking about also has the tatoo (or is it <br />burned <br />    into the<br />      skin? Can somebody confirm this?) on his bicep. </p>
<p>  rahul , kamal also had a thenkalai naamam( straight lined like a <br />  trident rather than the U of vadakalai)</p>
<p>  but one doubt??<br />  didnt vadakalai originate after ramanuja??? then how does he do <br />this <br />  say some 50 years prior?</p>
<p>  can sps clarify the timelines of</p>
<p>  a. ramanuja<br />  b. the chitrakootam incident of govindarajar and the sea dropping.</p>
<p>  isnt there a prevalent story that ramanuja recovered it and placed <br />  it in kizh tirupathi??? ??</p>
<p>  venketesh</p>
<p>  They are not <br />    allowed to have<br />      a moustache/beard too. But Kamal has both in that particular <br />  scene.<br />      I think its pretty hard to stick with the legend in the movie. <br />    Maybe Kamal<br />      just took the cusp and formed a creative story based on that. <br />The <br />    movie<br />      should clear this up.</p>

<p>        Well, that was a really confusing statement from MK. <br />Actually <br />    according<br />        to the Srivaishnavite Guruparampara which talks about the <br />  stories <br />    of<br />        all the Acharyas of Srivaishnavism starting from Nathamuni <br />until<br />        Manavalamamuni, it is not Ramanuja who was asked by the Chola <br />    King to<br />        recite Siva's name as supreme.</p>
<p>        The story goes thus: (As taken from the book "Guruparampara <br />    Prabhavam")</p>
<p>        ..... Once when Ramanuja was away from his mutt, at Kaveri <br />for <br />  his<br />        bath, the soldiers of the Chola King came to his mutt and <br />    informed that<br />        the King has ordained Ramanuja to court. Knowing well about <br />the<br />        Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, the <br />    foremost<br />        disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome of <br />the<br />        meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya <br />and <br />    hence he<br />        silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along with <br />    Periya<br />        Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the <br />Chola <br />    King in<br />        the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other disciples <br />of<br />        Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and asked <br />  them <br />    to<br />        prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though <br />  Ramanuja <br />    did<br />        not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that <br />  Koorathazhwan <br />    has<br />        already left in disguise, and also giving in to the pressure <br />by <br />    his<br />        other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of <br />his <br />    Acharya<br />        (Periya Nambi) and his Sishya (Koorathazhwan) , left for <br />Melkote <br />  in<br />        present day Karnataka.</p>
<p>        Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However, <br />there <br />    was a<br />        minister by name "Naalooran" in King's court, who was once <br />    supposed to<br />        have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately identified <br />  him<br />        (traditional accounts vary from calling this act as treachery <br />  to <br />    utmost<br />        concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth yet to <br />be<br />        deciphered) as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained <br />    Koorathazhwan to<br />        write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The <br />    wording that<br />        Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam <br />  nAsthi".<br />        Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course <br />  Koorathazhwan <br />    did<br />        write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi thatha <br />    param".<br />        Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than 'sivam". In older <br />days <br />    the<br />        words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. drONam <br />  was <br />    larger<br />        in measurement than sivam.</p>
<p>        On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and asked <br />  the <br />    eyes<br />        of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya Nambi. <br />    However<br />        Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my <br />eyes. <br />  I <br />    will<br />        do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" and <br />    plucks it<br />        himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the pain.</p>
<p>        This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete screw-<br />up <br />  in <br />    the<br />        screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true. <br />  However <br />    we<br />        cannot conclude until the movie is out and we see it for <br />    ourselves.</p>

        <p>Mr Venketesh,</p>
<p>To answer straight, yes, the Thenkalai signs "were" prevalent and <br />they were the only ones prevalent. I am not trying to be biased here <br />but let me present just one proof here. I have already discussed the <br />logic behind Thenkalais only being prevalent during those times in <br />the article that I said I have written. I would like to present it <br />only if some one is interested. Please do not think that I am trying <br />to build-up here. Actually I wrote that article during one of the <br />debates on the Vadakalai and Thenkalai issues. That is the reason, I <br />am asking for the permission to write about it here.</p>
<p>Now for the example/proof about the Thenkalai namam. Again I will <br />take refuge under the Srivaishnava Kulapathi Nammazhwar. In his <br />Thiruvaimozhi, he sings about the style of the namam. He says.....</p>
<p>netRiyuL ninRu ennai AaLum niRai malarp pAdhangaL sooDi......</p>
<p>Note the words, "niRai malarp pAdhangaL". I am sure you would all <br />have noticed at some point of time that it is only the Thenkalai <br />namam which depicted as the two legs of Vishnu over the Lotus flower <br />with Lakshmi embedded between the legs. This just is one example. <br />Incidentally this is the only reference to any namam of any sort in <br />all the 4000 Divya Prabhandams. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>  its not the philosphy but just if the signs of thenkalai were <br />  prevalent during the date of the story line.</p>
<p>  just like the rajagopurams of chidambaram are shown in the song , <br />but <br />  its doubtful if thillai had a rajagopuram at that time.</p>
<p>    Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is neither acting as <br />    Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. </p>
<p>  the song mentions his name as vishnudasan son of rajya lakshmi and <br />  srinivasan( incidentally the names of his real parents.</p>

        <p>Mr Venketesh</p>
<p>The origin of the Vadakalai sect is a perennial debate going on <br />between both the sects of Srivaishnavism. The thenkalais claim that <br />vadakalai as a distinct sect originated, not only after Ramanuja, but <br />only after Manavala Mamunigal, the last acharya in the Guruparampara. <br />The vadakalais claim that thenkaalai originated from Pillai <br />Lokacharya, the predecessor of Manavala Mamunigal.</p>
<p>This debate will never end as both are not ready to accept the <br />other's views. Let us leave it at that. However, if one enters into a <br />philosophical debate, I had recently written a small writeup <br />regarding this kalai differences in one of the personal mails on that <br />debate. If members are willing, I can share it here. Ofcourse, it is <br />subject to a debate.</p>
<p>Ramanuja was born in the year 1017 AD and he lived for 120 years. He <br />attained Paramapadham in the year 1137 AD. These are the timelines <br />which all the historians accept unopposed.</p>
<p>Regarding the Chitrakoodam incident, this has no link to the <br />Koorathazhwan episode. This is said to have happened later, though <br />within the times of Ramanuja. And you are right in saying that <br />Ramanuja retrived the Moolavar of Chitrakoodam from the sea and got <br />it installed in Kizh Thirupathi. I am not pretty sure, how he was <br />reinstalled back at Chitrakoodam. I only read somewhere (may be in <br />this group itself) that He was reinstated during the times of Nayak <br />kings much against the wishes of the Dikshitars of Chitrakoodam.</p>
<p>Coming to the movie, I presume that Kamal is neither acting as <br />Ramanuja nor Koorathazhwan. He is just the priest of the Temple of <br />Govindarajar, a normal character, who finds no mention in the <br />history. </p>

<p>  They are not <br />    allowed to have<br />      a moustache/beard too.

<p>        Well, that was a really confusing statement from MK. <br />Actually <br />    according<br />        to the Srivaishnavite Guruparampara which talks about the <br />  stories <br />    of<br />        all the Acharyas of Srivaishnavism starting from Nathamuni <br />until<br />        Manavalamamuni, it is not Ramanuja who was asked by the Chola <br />    King to<br />        recite Siva's name as supreme.</p>
<p>        The story goes thus: (As taken from the book "Guruparampara <br />    Prabhavam")</p>
<p>        ..... Once when Ramanuja was away from his mutt, at Kaveri <br />for <br />  his<br />        bath, the soldiers of the Chola King came to his mutt and <br />    informed that<br />        the King has ordained Ramanuja to court. Knowing well about <br />the<br />        Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, the <br />    foremost<br />        disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome of <br />the<br />        meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya <br />and <br />    hence he<br />        silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along with <br />    Periya<br />        Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the <br />Chola <br />    King in<br />        the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other disciples <br />of<br />        Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and asked <br />  them <br />    to<br />        prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though <br />  Ramanuja <br />    did<br />        not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that <br />  Koorathazhwan <br />    has<br />        already left in disguise, and also giving in to the pressure <br />by <br />    his<br />        other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of <br />his <br />    Acharya<br />        (Periya Nambi) and his Sishya (Koorathazhwan), left for <br />Melkote <br />  in<br />        present day Karnataka.</p>
<p>        Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However, <br />there <br />    was a<br />        minister by name "Naalooran" in King's court, who was once <br />    supposed to<br />        have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately identified <br />  him<br />        (traditional accounts vary from calling this act as treachery <br />  to <br />    utmost<br />        concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth yet to <br />be<br />        deciphered) as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained <br />    Koorathazhwan to<br />        write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The <br />    wording that<br />        Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam <br />  nAsthi".<br />        Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course <br />  Koorathazhwan <br />    did<br />        write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi thatha <br />    param".<br />        Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than 'sivam". In older <br />days <br />    the<br />        words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. drONam <br />  was <br />    larger<br />        in measurement than sivam.</p>
<p>        On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and asked <br />  the <br />    eyes<br />        of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya Nambi. <br />    However<br />        Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my <br />eyes. <br />  I <br />    will<br />        do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" and <br />    plucks it<br />        himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the pain.</p>
<p>        This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete screw-<br />up <br />  in <br />    the<br />        screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true. <br />  However <br />    we<br />        cannot conclude until the movie is out and we see it for <br />    ourselves.</p>

        <p>Mr Dinakaran,</p>
<p>Let me answer your questions.</p>
<p>1. Regarding the Tatoo:<br />Yes I saw that too. It is correct. The Srivaishnavites will bear the <br />marks of Sangu on their Left Shoulder and Chakra on their Right <br />shoulder. This signifies that, person has completely surrendered to <br />Vishnu and has accepted Him as his Sole-Saviour. </p>
<p>To reflect a little on this, this act of getting the Sangu-Chakram <br />marks embossed is called "samAsrayaNam". The equivalent of this is <br />the "thAli" that the women wears from their husband. Here the husband <br />is supposed to be the Sole Saviour of the women and she is supposed <br />to only rely on her husband for everything. Philosophically, in <br />Srivaishnavism, it is considered that all jeevAthmAs are female in <br />Nature and the only Male is the Supreme Being, which in this case is <br />Vishnu. So when one gets the "samAshrayaNam" done, he is supposed to <br />be faithful only to Vishnu and not to anyone else.</p>
<p>This is why you see that staunch Srivaishnavites do not go to any <br />Siva temple. Rest assured it is not fanaticism, but utmost loyalty to <br />Vishnu considered as their husband. Like any chaste woman would treat <br />any other men (other than her husband) with respect, but will never <br />look forward to them for anything, the Srivaishnavites as a practice, <br />go and pray only at the Vishnu Temples, though inherently the respect <br />is there for all gods, be it Siva or Muruga or Ganapathi.</p>
<p>2. Beard and Moustache:</p>
<p>Together, both are allowed but none in isolation. I honestly do not <br />know what is the significance of this. But that is the practice that <br />I know. I cant have a moustache alone. However if one grows them <br />together, it is okay. Probably some Brahminical Ritualistic <br />significance! Any other learned member can throw some light on this.</p>
<p>However the buzz is that Kamal had contact some Vaishnavite scholars <br />in Triplicane and other places. So if he still has taken such a scene <br />like King asking Ramanuja instead of Koorathazhwan to recite the <br />verses, it is nothing but a GLOBAL SCREW-UP!! :-)</p>

<p>    Well, that was a really confusing statement from MK. Actually <br />according<br />    to the Srivaishnavite Guruparampara which talks about the stories <br />of<br />    all the Acharyas of Srivaishnavism starting from Nathamuni until<br />    Manavalamamuni, it is not Ramanuja who was asked by the Chola <br />King to<br />    recite Siva's name as supreme.</p>
<p>    The story goes thus: (As taken from the book "Guruparampara <br />Prabhavam")</p>
<p>    ..... Once when Ramanuja was away from his mutt, at Kaveri for his<br />    bath, the soldiers of the Chola King came to his mutt and <br />informed that<br />    the King has ordained Ramanuja to court. Knowing well about the<br />    Saivaite inclinations of the Chola King, Koorathazhwan, the <br />foremost<br />    disciple of Ramanuja, was much worried about the outcome of the<br />    meeting. He thought it was his duty to protect his Acharya and <br />hence he<br />    silently adorned the ascetic robes of Ramanuja and along with <br />Periya<br />    Nambi, the Acharya of Ramanuja, went to the court of the Chola <br />King in<br />    the disguise of Ramanuja. He also instructed other disciples of<br />    Ramanuja to carry the normal robes of a "samsari" and asked them <br />to<br />    prevail upon Ramanuja to escape with that robes. Though Ramanuja <br />did<br />    not accept this at the beginning, knowing well that Koorathazhwan <br />has<br />    already left in disguise, and also giving in to the pressure by <br />his<br />    other sishyas, prayed Sri Ranganatha for the well being of his <br />Acharya<br />    (Periya Nambi) and his Sishya (Koorathazhwan), left for Melkote in<br />    present day Karnataka.</p>
<p>    Koorthazhwan stood before the King, in disguise. However, there <br />was a<br />    minister by name "Naalooran" in King's court, who was once <br />supposed to<br />    have been a sishya of Koorthazhwan. He immediately identified him<br />    (traditional accounts vary from calling this act as treachery to <br />utmost<br />    concern about his own acharya being prosecuted - truth yet to be<br />    deciphered) as not Ramanuja. However the King ordained <br />Koorathazhwan to<br />    write a declaration accepting Siva as the Supreme God. The <br />wording that<br />    Koorathazhwan was to have declared was "sivAth paratharam nAsthi".<br />    Meaning there is None Greater than Siva. Of course Koorathazhwan <br />did<br />    write it. But added another line to it. "drONamasthi thatha <br />param".<br />    Meaning, However "drONam" is larger than 'sivam". In older days <br />the<br />    words sivam and drONam were used as the measurements. drONam was <br />larger<br />    in measurement than sivam.</p>
<p>    On hearing this sarcasm the Chola King was outraged and asked the <br />eyes<br />    of Koorathazhwan to plucked along with that of Periya Nambi. <br />However<br />    Koorthazhwan said "why does anyone else need to pluck my eyes. I <br />will<br />    do t myself as I have seen a sinner through these eyes" and <br />plucks it<br />    himself. In this process Periya Nambi dies due to the pain.</p>
<p>    This is how the account goes. So I suspect a complete screw-up in <br />the<br />    screen play, if whatever MK said in the function is true. However <br />we<br />    cannot conclude until the movie is out and we see it for <br />ourselves.</p>

        <p>I just saw Kalaignar's note about the first scene. He mentions that<br />the Chola king asked Ramanjuar to not tell "Narayana" and asked him to<br />say "Shiva"</p>

<p>If this incident never happened, then I don't know who advised Kamal<br />about it and how he took it. But I am sure everybody will think the<br />movie is correct, but we can wait and see once the movie is released<br />and revisit the debates.</p>

<p>  venketesh<br />====================</p></blockquote>
<p>I think we discussed some of these leads earlier too.</p>
<p>Before consolidating we will hear the views of our members again..</p>
<p>I have also been counter checking with some knowledgable sources.</p>
<p>The essence of details like this:</p>
<p>CHITRAKOODAM is how ( Nammazhwar ? Thiruvoymozhi) described this <br />place of worship..</p>
<p>Leading to PAINTED IMAGE on CLOTH which was traditional...</p>
<p>It is also noted from the same Thiruvoymozhi that it was established <br />by the Thillai Moovayiravar (Saivites) and worshipped by them.. !</p>
<p>(Friction theory between Saivites - Vaishnavites at this point goes <br />off ::)</p>
<p>Re Guhai-idi kalagam / Thirumeyyam uprise etc., Pls read Kudanthai <br />Sethuraman (all related to post St.Ramanujar period) collective <br />works.</p>
<p>The Painted image - known as PAADAGAM - which comprised of <br />Govindarajar (along with other Paadagams thus named as <br />Chithrakoodam - Art Place of Worship) was detoriated over a period <br />of time...</p>
<p>OTTAKOOTHAR says " Chozhan Kadalil pugavittan .. " (interpreted as <br />put under the sea with reverence .. )..</p>
<p>Re St Ramajuar's Melkottai details etc., Pls check and read <br />Srirangam Shree Vaishnavashree Krisdhnamachariar's PAANCHAJANYAM <br />issues...</p>
<p>Re Chozha's contributions to Viashnavism, pls check our Archieves..</p>
<p>We will summerise sometime again ...</p>
<p>Re Ginji Nayaks period resistence etc., will post again.</p>

One of his ministers, a vaishnavite, to<br />  avoid the harassement to simple folks, told the king to make <br />Ramanuja<br />  accept Siva's supremacy, as he was their most visible and prominent<br />  guru.

Ramanuja was persuaded by his devotees to leave chola<br />  territory and he eventually settled in Melkote; he returned to <br />Srirangam<br />  only after the king's death.</p>
<p>  The king was not against vishnu or vaisnavas; there is no <br />contradiction<br />  in his making endowments to Srirangam and other temples.</p>

<p>    Re Dr. Nagaswamy's article, it is a well researched work. I am<br />    reading this for the first time. Missed earlier.<br />    ------------------------<br />    CONCLUSION BY DR. NAGASWAMY is as under::</p>
<p>    The study of Srngam epigraphs of the time of Kul?&#7749;ga-I<br />  clearly<br />    and in unmistakable terms show the personal interest of the king <br />in<br />    the temple, the devotion of the king , the queens and their<br />    endowments, the provisions for the recitation of <br />Thiruvaimo&#7739;i<br />    twice<br />    in the same reign, the endowments of flower gardens, the <br />reclamation<br />    of silted lands, institution of festivals etc., show a period of<br />    great activity in the temple, and its prosperous condition, <br />which is<br />    totally at variance with the Ramanuja legend. As per the records <br />the<br />    King , the queen and his officers have particpated with in every <br />form<br />    of pious deed prescribed by the tredtion On the basis of this<br />    scientific study of the subject found in the actual contemporary<br />    records of the temple the story that Kul?&#7749;ga I, was an<br />    antogonist<br />    of ڲi&#7779;h&#7751;avism and that he persecuted R⭢nuja is<br />  a<br />    fiction of<br />    imagination, can not be sustained and must be rejected.<br />    References</p></blockquote>

Ramanuja was persuaded by his devotees to leave chola<br />territory and he eventually settled in Melkote; he returned to Srirangam<br />only after the king's death.</p>
<p>The king was not against vishnu or vaisnavas; there is no contradiction<br />in his making endowments to Srirangam and other temples.</p>
<p>I still firmly believe that we must not jump into hasty conclusions<br />disregarding tradition and faith.</p>

<p>  The study of Srngam epigraphs of the time of Kul?&#7749;ga-I<br />clearly<br />  and in unmistakable terms show the personal interest of the king in<br />  the temple, the devotion of the king , the queens and their<br />  endowments, the provisions for the recitation of Thiruvaimo&#7739;i<br />  twice<br />  in the same reign, the endowments of flower gardens, the reclamation<br />  of silted lands, institution of festivals etc., show a period of<br />  great activity in the temple, and its prosperous condition, which is<br />  totally at variance with the Ramanuja legend. As per the records the<br />  King , the queen and his officers have particpated with in every form<br />  of pious deed prescribed by the tredtion On the basis of this<br />  scientific study of the subject found in the actual contemporary<br />  records of the temple the story that Kul?&#7749;ga I, was an<br />  antogonist<br />  of ڲi&#7779;h&#7751;avism and that he persecuted R⭢nuja is<br />a<br />  fiction of<br />  imagination, can not be sustained and must be rejected.<br />  References</p>

        <p>Hi </p>
<p>Again a small question...</p>
<p>It is said that Ramanuja recovers the Vishnu idol from<br />the sea and re-installs them at Tirupathi... </p>
<p>So is current Tirupathi Venkatesa idol is the same<br />one?</p>

<p>but at this period of time how many raja gopurams were there?<br />perhaps none</p>
<p>The South Gopuram was constructed by a Pandya King.This is evidenced <br />by the presence of the fish emblem of the Pandyas that have been <br />sculpted on the ceiling. Historically, the Pandyas are known to have <br />scupted two fishes facing each other when they complete the Gopuram ( <br />and leave it with one fish in case it is incomplete). The South <br />gopuram bears the two fish insigna of the Pandyas. Subsequently, the <br />Gopuram appears to have been redone by the Pallava King Koperunsingan <br />I ( &#2990;&#3009;&#2980;&#2994;&#3006;&#2990;&#3021; &#2965;&#3019;&#2986;&#3021;&#2986;&#3014;&#2992;&#3009;&#2974;&#3021;&#2970;&#3007;&#2969;&#3021;&#2965;&#2985;&#3021; ) c 1216 -1242 CE ,after <br />retaining the first level. This Gopuram is called the Sokkaseeyan <br />Thirunilai Ezhugopuram (&#2970;&#3018;&#2965;&#3021;&#2965;&#2970;&#3021;&#2970;&#3008;&#2991;&#2985;&#3021; &#2980;&#3007;&#2992;&#3009;&#2984;&#3007;&#2994;&#3016; &#2958;&#2996;&#3009;&#2965;&#3019;&#2986;&#3009;&#2992;&#2990;&#3021; )</p>
<p>The West Gopuram was constructed by Jadavarma Sundara Pandyan I <br />(&#2990;&#3009;&#2980;&#2994;&#3006;&#2990;&#3021; &#2972;&#2975;&#3006;&#2997;&#2992;&#3021;&#2990;&#2985;&#3021; &#2970;&#3009;&#2984;&#3021;&#2980;&#2992; &#2986;&#3006;&#2979;&#3021;&#2975;&#3007;&#2991;&#2985;&#3021;)1251 -1268 CE.</p>
<p>The North Gopuram was constructed by the Vijayanagara King <br />Krishnadevarayar (&#2965;&#3007;&#2992;&#3009;&#2999;&#3021;&#2979;&#2980;&#3015;&#2997; &#2990;&#2965;&#3006;&#2992;&#3006;&#2991;&#2992;&#3021;)1509-1529 CE.</p>
<p>The East Gopuram was first constructed by the Pallava King <br />Koperunsingan II (&#2951;&#2992;&#2979;&#3021;&#2975;&#3006;&#2990;&#3021; &#2965;&#3019;&#2986;&#3021;&#2986;&#3014;&#2992;&#3009;&#2974;&#3021;&#2970;&#3007;&#2969;&#3021;&#2965;&#2985;&#3021;)c 1243 - 1279 CE. <br />Subsequent repairs were carried out by Subbammal (&#2970;&#3009;&#2986;&#3021;&#2986;&#2990;&#3021;&#2990;&#3006;&#2995;&#3021;), who <br />was the mother-in-law of the famous philonthrophist Pachaiappa <br />Mudaliar (&#2980;&#3007;&#2992;&#3009;&#2986;&#2970;&#3021;&#2970;&#3016;&#2991;&#2986;&#3021;&#2986; &#2990;&#3009;&#2980;&#2994;&#3007;&#2991;&#3006;&#2992;&#3021;).</p>

        <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I just finished reveiwing Dasavatharam songs - they were very mediocre.<br />maybe the visuals will help them. As of now, its pretty dull stuff.</p>

<p>=====================</p>
<p>Re Dr. Nagaswamy's article, it is a well researched work. I am<br />reading this for the first time. Missed earlier.<br />------------------------<br />CONCLUSION BY DR. NAGASWAMY is as under::</p>
<p>The study of Srngam epigraphs of the time of Kul?&#7749;ga-I clearly<br />and in unmistakable terms show the personal interest of the king in<br />the temple, the devotion of the king , the queens and their<br />endowments, the provisions for the recitation of Thiruvaimo&#7739;i <br />twice<br />in the same reign, the endowments of flower gardens, the reclamation<br />of silted lands, institution of festivals etc., show a period of<br />great activity in the temple, and its prosperous condition, which is<br />totally at variance with the Ramanuja legend. As per the records the<br />King , the queen and his officers have particpated with in every form<br />of pious deed prescribed by the tredtion On the basis of this<br />scientific study of the subject found in the actual contemporary<br />records of the temple the story that Kul?&#7749;ga I, was an <br />antogonist<br />of ڲi&#7779;h&#7751;avism and that he persecuted R⭢nuja is a <br />fiction of<br />imagination, can not be sustained and must be rejected.<br />References</p>
<p>------------------------------------<br />ADDING : (As earlier posted by me in MSG 13499 / 01.09.2006)</p>
<p>NARASIMHA SWAMY WAS THE KULADEYVAM of KULOTHUNGA I ..... !<br />------------- as could be seen below</p>
<p>ENNAYIRAM INSCRIPTION :: (Further details below) ::</p>
<p>ARE 333 of 1917 mentions of similar Samprokshnam by Rajendra I<br />earlier.</p>
<p>IT IS KULOTHINGA's inscription in his 41st year which is VERY<br />IMPORTANT :<br />THRIBUVANACHAKRAVARTHIYIN K-U-L-A-D-E-Y-V-A-M-A-N-A AZHAGIYA<br />NARASIMHA PERUMAL THIRUKKOIYILIL DEYVA PRADISTAIYUM,<br />JALAPRADISTAIYUM SEYDARULINAR.

<p>  PRANAMS TO SAINT SRI RAMANUJAR.<br />  ====================================================</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Kulothunga I ruled from 1070 to 1122 AD with Vikramachozhan<br />  overlapping 1118 to 1135 AD. Vikrama's 13th year is AD 1130. There<br />  were grants almost every year and in 1140 AD there was a grant by<br />  Kulothunga II.as well.</p>
<p>  It is evidenced that during the 120 years of lifetime of Sri<br />  Ramanujar uninterruptedly Chozha dynasty has given grants to<br />  Srirangam temple as could be seen from more 120 inscriptions ..</p></blockquote>
<p>ENNAYIRAM : Our members are familiar with this place. On our trip</p>
<blockquote><p>  to Thanjavur, we got down about 10 Km after Tindivanam and found a<br />  recent stone pointing the direction of Ennayiram :: Kavi<br />  Kalamegam's birth place. There are stories that 8000 Jains were<br />  put on Kazhu.<br />  Another story that Ashta Saharsra Brahmins hail from this place.<br />  however as desired by SARVA SIVA PNDITHAR - GURU OF RAJENDRA I - a<br />  Siva temple was constructed .. nearby place is Esalam where copper<br />  plates confirming that Aditha Karikalan put Veerpandian's head at<br />  the Fort Entrance of Thanjai was found about 20 years back...<br />  -------------------------<br />  " Pillailogam Jeeyar" in his "Ramanujarya Divya Satidhai"<br />mentioned<br />  that Udayavar (Sri Ramanujar)has visited Thirumalai thrice and<br />each<br />  time he did not fail to visit Thirukkaoilore "Idaikkazhi<br />  Naayanar".</p>
<p>  ENNAYIRATHU ECHCHAN a devotee of Udayavar was ordered certain<br />  disciplines : Washing THIRUPPARIYATTAM - clothings of Sree<br />  Viahsnavite devotees (like Meykandar - Sivanadiayar of Nallur! -<br />  Actor Nagesh did this role well in Thiruvilayadal movie). From<br />  Thirukkoilore he went to Ennayiram and Blessed Ennayirathu Echchan.</p>
<p>  During Sri Ramanurjar's 120 yr life time (1017 - 1136) Rajendra I<br />(<br />  1012 - 1044) Rajendra II (1052 - 1064) Rajamahendran (1059 - 1062)<br />  veerarajendran (1063 - 1070), Adhirajendran (1068 - 1071)<br />  Kulothubnga I (1070 - 1122), Vikrama chozhan (1118 - 1135) and<br />  Kulothunga II (1133 to 1150) - EIGHT Chozha Kings were in Power.</p>
<p>  RRC (985 - 1014) established RAJARAJA CHARUTVEDI MANGALAM which<br />  included Ennayiram. In Ennayiram, AZHAGIYA NARASIMHA PERUMAL<br />  (VINNAGARM) was constructed.</p>
<p>  1. ARE 335 of 1917 Rajendra I - 25th yr : the income of the temple<br />  lands should be shared by (1) Moolasthanam udayar temple (2)<br />  Rajaraja Vinnagara Azhwar @ NARASIMHA PERUMAL VINNAGARAM (3)<br />  KUNDAVAI VINNAGARAM (Recall Ponniyinselvan !) @ DADAPURAM<br />  KARIVARADHA PERUMAL TEMPLE and (4) SUNDARA CHOZHA VINNAGARAM. Also<br />  daily poojas of Surya .. sapthamatrika .. saastha.. Gramadevathas<br />  etc., need to be performed ..</p>
<p>  2. ARE 341 of 1917: Rajendra I - 30th yr : Aippasi Sadhayam and<br />  Maasi Punarvasu (?) Vizha..</p>
<p>  3. ARE 333 of 1917 : Rajendra I - 45 Veli grant for practicising<br />  Thiruvaymozhi, Vedas, Vyakranas, Vedantha and Meemasa sastras..<br />  Four persons appointed to hymn Thiruvaymozhi daily.. 3 kuruni nel<br />  25 Shree vaishanas fed daily.. Aani Anusham Seven day festival.<br />  60 kalam nel. 3 kazhanju gold for 1000 Shree Vaishnavites. Beggers<br />  given food and clothes. There was a Vedapadasala in Gangaikonda<br />  Chozhan mandapam where 270 Brahmacharis studied and were given 6<br />  naazhi nel daily basis. Teachers given 10506 kalam nel.. 8<br />Kazhanju<br />  for those who taught 8 sargas and 12 for those who taught 12<br />sargas.</p>
<p>  4. ARE 347 of 1917 : On Sreejayanthi (Lord Krishna's birthday ) -<br />  Convocation - each successful student was awarded Gold Ring and<br />  Golden Lotus! Long lists of grants and receivables;  <br />  5. ARE 330 of 1917 - Rajadirajan I - Kadaitharam - Least taxing..</p>
<p>  6. ARE 340 of 1947 - KULOTHUNGA I - 7th year - Grant of Cows for<br />  burning perpetual lamps.</p>
<p>  7. ARE 344 of 1947 - KULOTHUNGA I - 39th year - 50th day :: Under<br />  the auspicious of Puliyur (Our Kodambakkam) Verkkadu Kulothunga<br />  Moovenda velalan PERFORMED TEMPLE RENOVATION, TANK FORMED AND<br />  SAMPROKSHANAM !</p>
<p>  ARE 333 of 1917 mentions of similar Samprokshnam by Rajendra I<br />  earlier.</p>
<p>  IT IS KULOTHINGA's inscription in his 41st year which is VERY<br />  IMPORTANT :<br />  THRIBUVANACHAKRAVARTHIYIN K-U-L-A-D-E-Y-V-A-M-A-N-A AZHAGIYA<br />  NARASIMHA PERUMAL THIRUKKOIYILIL DEYVA PRADISTAIYUM,<br />  JALAPRADISTAIYUM SEYDARULINAR. HE performed this on the eve of<br />  commencing war against Kalingam !</p>
<p>  There are grants from RAJRAJA II (326 OF 1917) and VEERARAJENDRAN<br />  (345 OF 1917).</p>
<p>  (Ennayiram) Narasimha Perumal was considered KULADEYVAM of<br />  KULOTHUNGA I... as seen from the above inscriptions ..</p>
<p>  We may have to reconsider several things in the light of the above.</p>

        <p>I listened to the songs. THe song you mentioned is the one of the songs thats good in that <br />movie. Good lyrics too. Typical hindi flavor in some of the songs. 'Mukunda' has the flavor of <br />'konjum mainakkale' from kandukonden kandukonen. Why a hindi music directorfor this <br />movie?</p>
<p>too much hype, oothikkama irukkanum. Because Kamal has bad luck for all hisexperiments <br />and unique movies.</p>

<p>there is one song with the pallaandu in the back ground<br />kallendru paarthaal kadavul therivathillai<br />kadavul endru paarththaal kalladi therivathillai</p>
<p>some words address the king<br />"you may be rajarajan<br />but rangarajan is better than you"</p>
<p>also kamal has a charecter most presumably called vishnudasan<br />the song goes rajya lakshmi and srinivasan are the parents of vishnu <br />dasan<br />( he has punned on the real names of hir real life parents)</p>
<p>also he talks about god sinking in the sea.</p>
