<p>Anyway, the existance of a Hindu temple in Quanzhou, and its Tamil <br />reporting<br />goes to show the trading partnership of south India and China. he <br />details of<br />six lines in Tamil of the Kalvettu:1. harah svasti sri sagaptam 1203 <br />vatu<br />cittirai2. ccittirai nal sri ce[kace]<acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  tirumenikku nan3. raka <br />udaiyar<br />tiruk[ka]niccuramudaiya nayanarai4. eriyaruiap panninar campanda <br />perumal5. ana<br />tavaccakkaravartikal ce[ka]caikan parman6. padiAccording to Prof. <br />Noboru<br />Karashima of Tokyo Taisho university, "The above text reveals that <br />in 1281 a<br />Tamilian called ChampandaPerumal alias tavach-chakkravartikal, by <br />permission of<br />Chekachai <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym , i. e.,<br />Chchchai Kahan (the Chinese Emperor Kublai Khan?) installed an idol <br />of Siva<br />there to pray for the health of the authority. The installation of <br />Siva idol<br />may well be taken for the establishment of a Siva temple which is <br />called as<br />Thirukkanichuram obviuosly named after the emperoer Khan and it is <br />quite<br />interesting to note in this connection that in Quanzhou there are <br />still many<br />pieces of stone sculptures and pillars with carved designs which <br />represent<br />Hindu religion. The sculptures and pillars remaining in a Buddhist <br />temple<br />called the kaiyuansi were studied by A K KUmaraswamy but since 1950 <br />many more<br />pieces have been excavated. These Hindu sculptures and pillars <br />indicate that<br />there was once a fairly big Hindu temple in Quanzhou. It has been <br />suggested by<br />a<br />Chineses scholar that a Hindu temple called the Fanfosi was <br />constructed by a<br />son-in-law of Pu Shougeng a famous muslim high official living in <br />Quanzhou<br />during the thirteenth century. But the Tamil inscription mentioned <br />above may<br />explain better the circumstances in which a Hindu temple was <br />established in<br />Quanzhou. Anyway, the existance of Siva sculptures and a Tamil <br />inscription<br />reporting the establishment of a Hindu temple is a sure indication <br />that there<br />was a considearble Hindu Tamil population in Quanzhou during the <br />thirteenth<br />century"</acronym></acronym></p>

<p>conference at Univ. of California, Berkeley--------------------------<br />--------------------------------The Chola Empire---------------------<br />-----"The Cholas came to power in the late 9th century, and until <br />the late 13th century, they ruled most of South India, Sri Lanka, <br />the Maldive Islands, and even parts of the Indonesian island of Java <br />from their homeland near Thanjavur (Tanjore) on the southeastern <br />coast of what is now Tamil Nadu, India. It was founded by Vijalaya, <br />who captured Tanjore in 850 AD. The greatest among the Chola rulers <br />were the imperialists Rajaraja (985-1014 AD) and his son Rajendra I <br />(1012 1044 AD). These rulers adopted a maritime policy allowing <br />their expansionist arm to reach far longer than pure land expansion <br />would allow, Maldives and Sri Lanka. Under Rajaraja the Chola <br />kingdom grew into an extensive and well knit empire. The empire <br />maintained diplomatic ties with countries as distant as Burma <br />Tremel's site, look at the Chola empire <br />maphttp://mitglied.lycos.de/ernsttremel/Leere%20Seite%205.htm<br />(Ernst's Unicode Tamil <br />site:http://mitglied.lycos.de/ernsttremel/Leere%20Seite%206.htm )<br />When Chola emperors ruled most of S.

Kedah <br />has a wealth of ancient temple structures in the world famous Bujang <br />Valley. Apart from Kadaram, there was also the Kingdom of Gangga <br />Nagaram that lies in ruins today further down south after <br />destruction by King Raja Rajendra.There is yet another forgotten <br />thousand year old city of Kota Gelanggi, raided by the same King, <br />far down South, in the state of Johor. Its ruins in thick jungle <br />have been established via aerial photos and a ground level <br />expedition is being planned.The discovery of this place hit the <br />headlines of today's The Star newspaper, the major English in <br />Malaysia.This is the single most exciting news on the ancient <br />history of Malaysia apart from the Bujang <br />Valley.=======================sps wrote ::I was looking at the net <br />for the information.

Its discovery   was announced in February 2005. The <br />ruins are believed to be as old   as Borobudur and could pre-date <br />Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The   discovery of a temple known as Candi <br />Bemban and several artefacts in   the area have lead to the belief <br />of the existence of a government   before the Johor-Riau-Lingga <br />sultanate.    The site is located in the dense jungles of the <br />Malaysian state of   Johor, somewhere within a 140 square kilometre <br />site of a forest   reserve in the area surrounding Sungai Madek and <br />Sungai Lenggiu.    The discovery was made as a result of research on <br />Malay manuscripts   and local folklore. Reference to Kota Gelanggi <br />can also be found in   the Sejarah Melayu as a city of granite <br />structures located at the   head of the Johor River. Some scholars <br />believe this to also be the   Kingdom of Lo-Yue and the first centre <br />of trade for Srivijaya. There   is also suggestion that the city was <br />later known as Ganggayu or   Khlangkeo, which formed part of the <br />Ayutthaya Kingdom. The city   could also have been the unidentified <br />12th Naksat city.    The city was raided by the Chola conqueror <br />Rajendra Chola I, of the   South Indian Chola Dynasty in 1025.    On <br />April 28th 2006 The Malaysian National News Service (Bernama)   <br />reported that the "lost city" of Gelanggi or Linggiu, claimed to   <br />have been hidden in the jungles of Johor for more than a thousand   <br />years, does not exist. This was stated by an archaeologist in the   <br />National Heritage Department.    Khalid Syed Ali, the curator of <br />archaeology in the department's   research and development division, <br />said a team of researchers   carried out a study over a month in <br />July last year but found no   evidence of the "lost city".    Note <br />that this Kota Gelanggi is different from the Kota Gelanggi   caves <br />near Jerantut in Pahang.  </jaybee555@y...></p>

The installation<br />  of<br />      Siva idol<br />      may well be taken for the establishment of a Siva temple which<br />  is<br />      called as<br />      Thirukkanichuram obviuosly named after the emperoer Khan and it<br />  is<br />      quite<br />      interesting to note in this connection that in Quanzhou there<br />  are<br />      still many<br />      pieces of stone sculptures and pillars with carved designs which<br />      represent<br />      Hindu religion. The sculptures and pillars remaining in a<br />  Buddhist<br />      temple<br />      called the kaiyuansi were studied by A K KUmaraswamy but since<br />    1950<br />      many more<br />      pieces have been excavated. These Hindu sculptures and pillars<br />      indicate that<br />      there was once a fairly big Hindu temple in Quanzhou. It has<br />  been<br />      suggested by<br />      a<br />      Chineses scholar that a Hindu temple called the Fanfosi was<br />      constructed by a<br />      son-in-law of Pu Shougeng a famous muslim high official living<br />  in<br />      Quanzhou<br />      during the thirteenth century. But the Tamil inscription<br />  mentioned<br />      above may<br />      explain better the circumstances in which a Hindu temple was<br />      established in<br />      Quanzhou. Anyway, the existance of Siva sculptures and a Tamil<br />      inscription<br />      reporting the establishment of a Hindu temple is a sure<br />  indication<br />      that there<br />      was a considearble Hindu Tamil population in Quanzhou during the<br />      thirteenth<br />      century"</p>

<p>      20city.pdf      Kota Gelanggi or Perbendaharaan Permata<br />  (Treasury<br />    of<br />      Jewels in Malay   language) is an archaeological site that is<br />      believed to be the first   capital of the Srivijaya empire<br />  dating<br />      back to 650. Its discovery   was announced in February 2005. The<br />      ruins are believed to be as old   as Borobudur and could pre-<br />  date<br />      Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The   discovery of a temple known as<br />  Candi<br />      Bemban and several artefacts in   the area have lead to the<br />  belief<br />      of the existence of a government   before the Johor-Riau-Lingga<br />      sultanate.    The site is located in the dense jungles of the<br />      Malaysian state of   Johor, somewhere within a 140 square<br />    kilometre<br />      site of a forest   reserve in the area surrounding Sungai Madek<br />    and<br />      Sungai Lenggiu.    The discovery was made as a result of<br />  research<br />    on<br />      Malay manuscripts   and local folklore. Reference to Kota<br />  Gelanggi<br />      can also be found in   the Sejarah Melayu as a city of granite<br />      structures located at the   head of the Johor River. Some<br />  scholars<br />      believe this to also be the   Kingdom of Lo-Yue and the first<br />    centre<br />      of trade for Srivijaya. There   is also suggestion that the city<br />    was<br />      later known as Ganggayu or   Khlangkeo, which formed part of the<br />      Ayutthaya Kingdom. The city   could also have been the<br />    unidentified<br />      12th Naksat city.    The city was raided by the Chola conqueror<br />      Rajendra Chola I, of the   South Indian Chola Dynasty in 1025. </p>
<p>    On<br />      April 28th 2006 The Malaysian National News Service (Bernama)  <br />      reported that the "lost city" of Gelanggi or Linggiu, claimed to</p>
<p>      have been hidden in the jungles of Johor for more than a<br />  thousand</p>
<p>      years, does not exist. This was stated by an archaeologist in<br />  the</p>
<p>      National Heritage Department.    Khalid Syed Ali, the curator of<br />      archaeology in the department's   research and development<br />    division,<br />      said a team of researchers   carried out a study over a month in<br />      July last year but found no   evidence of the "lost city".   <br />  Note<br />      that this Kota Gelanggi is different from the Kota Gelanggi  <br />    caves<br />      near Jerantut in Pahang. </p>

<p>      20city.pdf      Kota Gelanggi or Perbendaharaan Permata <br />  (Treasury <br />    of <br />      Jewels in Malay   language) is an archaeological site that is <br />      believed to be the first   capital of the Srivijaya empire <br />  dating <br />      back to 650. Its discovery   was announced in February 2005. <br />The <br />      ruins are believed to be as old   as Borobudur and could pre-<br />  date <br />      Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The   discovery of a temple known as <br />  Candi <br />      Bemban and several artefacts in   the area have lead to the <br />  belief <br />      of the existence of a government   before the Johor-Riau-<br />Lingga <br />      sultanate.    The site is located in the dense jungles of the <br />      Malaysian state of   Johor, somewhere within a 140 square <br />    kilometre <br />      site of a forest   reserve in the area surrounding Sungai <br />Madek <br />    and <br />      Sungai Lenggiu.    The discovery was made as a result of <br />  research <br />    on <br />      Malay manuscripts   and local folklore. Reference to Kota <br />  Gelanggi <br />      can also be found in   the Sejarah Melayu as a city of granite <br />      structures located at the   head of the Johor River. Some <br />  scholars <br />      believe this to also be the   Kingdom of Lo-Yue and the first <br />    centre <br />      of trade for Srivijaya. There   is also suggestion that the <br />city <br />    was <br />      later known as Ganggayu or   Khlangkeo, which formed part of <br />the <br />      Ayutthaya Kingdom. The city   could also have been the <br />    unidentified <br />      12th Naksat city.    The city was raided by the Chola <br />conqueror <br />      Rajendra Chola I, of the   South Indian Chola Dynasty in <br />1025.  </p>
<p>    On <br />      April 28th 2006 The Malaysian National News Service (Bernama) </p>
<p>      reported that the "lost city" of Gelanggi or Linggiu, claimed <br />to </p>
<p>      have been hidden in the jungles of Johor for more than a <br />  thousand </p>
<p>      years, does not exist. This was stated by an archaeologist in <br />  the </p>
<p>      National Heritage Department.    Khalid Syed Ali, the curator <br />of <br />      archaeology in the department's   research and development <br />    division, <br />      said a team of researchers   carried out a study over a month <br />in <br />      July last year but found no   evidence of the "lost city".    <br />  Note <br />      that this Kota Gelanggi is different from the Kota Gelanggi   <br />    caves <br />      near Jerantut in Pahang.  </p>

<p>    20city.pdf      Kota Gelanggi or Perbendaharaan Permata <br />(Treasury <br />  of <br />    Jewels in Malay   language) is an archaeological site that is <br />    believed to be the first   capital of the Srivijaya empire <br />dating <br />    back to 650. Its discovery   was announced in February 2005. The <br />    ruins are believed to be as old   as Borobudur and could pre-<br />date <br />    Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The   discovery of a temple known as <br />Candi <br />    Bemban and several artefacts in   the area have lead to the <br />belief <br />    of the existence of a government   before the Johor-Riau-Lingga <br />    sultanate.    The site is located in the dense jungles of the <br />    Malaysian state of   Johor, somewhere within a 140 square <br />  kilometre <br />    site of a forest   reserve in the area surrounding Sungai Madek <br />  and <br />    Sungai Lenggiu.    The discovery was made as a result of <br />research <br />  on <br />    Malay manuscripts   and local folklore. Reference to Kota <br />Gelanggi <br />    can also be found in   the Sejarah Melayu as a city of granite <br />    structures located at the   head of the Johor River. Some <br />scholars <br />    believe this to also be the   Kingdom of Lo-Yue and the first <br />  centre <br />    of trade for Srivijaya. There   is also suggestion that the city <br />  was <br />    later known as Ganggayu or   Khlangkeo, which formed part of the <br />    Ayutthaya Kingdom. The city   could also have been the <br />  unidentified <br />    12th Naksat city.    The city was raided by the Chola conqueror <br />    Rajendra Chola I, of the   South Indian Chola Dynasty in 1025.  </p>
<p>  On <br />    April 28th 2006 The Malaysian National News Service (Bernama)   <br />    reported that the "lost city" of Gelanggi or Linggiu, claimed to </p>
<p>    have been hidden in the jungles of Johor for more than a <br />thousand </p>
<p>    years, does not exist. This was stated by an archaeologist in <br />the </p>
<p>    National Heritage Department.    Khalid Syed Ali, the curator of <br />    archaeology in the department's   research and development <br />  division, <br />    said a team of researchers   carried out a study over a month in <br />    July last year but found no   evidence of the "lost city".    <br />Note <br />    that this Kota Gelanggi is different from the Kota Gelanggi   <br />  caves <br />    near Jerantut in Pahang.  </p>

The installation of <br />  Siva idol<br />  may well be taken for the establishment of a Siva temple which is <br />  called as<br />  Thirukkanichuram obviuosly named after the emperoer Khan and it is <br />  quite<br />  interesting to note in this connection that in Quanzhou there are <br />  still many<br />  pieces of stone sculptures and pillars with carved designs which <br />  represent<br />  Hindu religion. The sculptures and pillars remaining in a Buddhist <br />  temple<br />  called the kaiyuansi were studied by A K KUmaraswamy but since <br />1950 <br />  many more<br />  pieces have been excavated. These Hindu sculptures and pillars <br />  indicate that<br />  there was once a fairly big Hindu temple in Quanzhou. It has been <br />  suggested by<br />  a<br />  Chineses scholar that a Hindu temple called the Fanfosi was <br />  constructed by a<br />  son-in-law of Pu Shougeng a famous muslim high official living in <br />  Quanzhou<br />  during the thirteenth century. But the Tamil inscription mentioned <br />  above may<br />  explain better the circumstances in which a Hindu temple was <br />  established in<br />  Quanzhou. Anyway, the existance of Siva sculptures and a Tamil <br />  inscription<br />  reporting the establishment of a Hindu temple is a sure indication <br />  that there<br />  was a considearble Hindu Tamil population in Quanzhou during the <br />  thirteenth<br />  century"</p>
