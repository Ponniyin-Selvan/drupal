October 2002, we decided to find out about the places mentioned in the novel- what condition they were in, and could they be visited? We referred books and maps, and found out that they could. A three-day trip was decided upon. Another article appeared in the Express this time, sending an open invite to the public, and a great, gaggling mass appeared on the Marina beach on Jan 26, 2003. The Kalki office people, surprised and curious, arrived with the Editor and a few crew people in tow, along with people from Ananda Vikatan. A tour map was finalised, accomodations arranged, and we started out on February 6, 003. The historical novel-writer 'Vishwaksenan' went with us on behalf of 'Kalki', to cover the trip.]]></description>
