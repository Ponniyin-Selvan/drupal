<p>Dear Vairam, </p>
<p>DR. KALAIKKOVAN, great son of Great Father Dr. Maa. Raasamanickanar, <br />who is an Authority in PALLAVAR VARALAARU ( Re Chozhar varalaru it <br />is KAN Sastry, Re Pandiar Varalaaru it is Sadhasiva Pandarathar )- <br />whose Centenary just concluded, used to say that we should put <br />efforts in finding TRUE HISTORY .. !~</p>
<p>About 5 years back, when we (Gokul - Kamal - Lanvaya - Ram - Krupa <br />and me among others ) listened to this WE did not understand the <br />REAL MEANING of this.. </p>
<p>Now at I realise that what we read or assume know is no were near <br />Truth and hardly efforts are on in this Direction.</p>
<p>I agree with you that THERE IS NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE IN THIS <br />DIRECTION .. All are based on the Iraiyanar Agapporul Nool .. which <br />itself needs authentification ..</p>
<p>1. Rift between the followers of Siva - Vishnu :: The recorded <br />evidences point 11th / 12th Century .. Nothing prior to 10th <br />Century.</p>
<p>Therefore period of SIVA VACKIAR need to be ascertained based on <br />cdertain dedtails. </p>
<p>I will also post evidence that followers of VISHNU displayed <br />VIBOOTHI in their Foreheads - during Bakthi period (8th Century ) <br />and THIRUVOYMOZHI was hymned in Siva Temples during Naayanmar period <br />(same 7th / 8 th Century).</p>
<p>There have been several " Idaicherugals " in History .. related to <br />traditions, literature and religion ..</p>
<p>Dr. Kalaikkovan (and Dr. Nalini) - by virtue of their exposure to <br />several facts - Truth - should have understood what is believed / <br />discussed widely and what is the reality..</p>
<p>To emlighten (history) infants like me, they revealed 5 years back <br />(some examples )::</p>
<p>1. Thanjai Big Temple Kalasm shadow does fall on the ground ..</p>
<p>2. Sigaram is not made of single stone of 80 tons as widely <br />believed..</p>
<p>3. Pillayarpatti is not Vinayaga Temple as widely believed .. it is <br />(Old) Siva Temple with Ayyanar in worship .. Sivalingam South <br />facing..</p>
<p>4. Pillayarpatti Kudavarai is NOT PALLAVA Kudavarai as widely <br />believed (even it is postulated that Pallavas are pioneers on <br />this).. but it is PANDYA KUDAVARAI .. ( with the technology learnt <br />through Jain sculptures !! )</p>
<p>And advised us to look for True History ...</p>
<p>and varalaaru.com was promoted in that direction .. !!</p>
<p>That is why I defer to quote Wikipedia (Source Authorless - but <br />collective and subjected to editing ) in discussions ..</p>
<p>Re BOGHAR, our Dear Member VIJAY has already posted certain details <br />in our Group earlier.<br />anbudan / sps</p>

<p>  Institute of Asian Studies, Chennai<br />  The IAS saw its modest beginning in 1982 at Tiruvanmiyur, a <br />  spiritual centre hallowed in the ancient literary and cultural <br />  traditions of Asia. Since then it has grown to become one of <br />India's <br />  premier indological research and publication institutes.</p>
<p>  Recently the Institute acquired two acres of choice land in <br />  Kanchipuram to launch a Bodhidharma Centre for Indian Philosophy, <br />  named after the South Indian Buddhist monk who traveled to China <br />in <br />  the 8th century AD and started the Ch'an (Japanese Zen) school of <br />  Mahayana Buddhism.</p>

<p>    could all this be true</p>
<p>    Kalangi Nathar was the guru of Bhogarnathar or Bhogar. Kalangi <br />    Nathar was from Benaras.</p>
<p>    Kalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. In <br />  China <br />    he is called as Confucius. Bhogarnathar who is called Laozi in <br />  China <br />    was the successor of Kalangi Nathar(Confucius).</p>
<p>    Bogar was a legendary South Indian siddhar (a mystic, yogi). He <br />  was <br />    said to have miraculous powers. He is also said in some New Age <br />    circles to have been associated with Mahavatar Babaji. Bhogar <br />was <br />  a <br />    South Indian by birth, belonging to the caste of goldsmiths, who <br />    became a siddhapurusha under the guidance of Kalangi Nathar. In <br />    Bogar's Saptakanda he reveals details of various medicinal <br />    preparations to his disciple Pullippani (so named as he is <br />  believed <br />    to have wandered in the forests atop a puli or tiger) and at <br />every <br />    stage he quotes his guru as the authority. Also Pulippani must <br />  have <br />    been a young man then, as he is often referred to as a balaka.</p>
<p>    It is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar <br />  proceeded <br />    to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences and his <br />  journey <br />    is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he <br />    demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction of <br />the <br />    aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a <br />steam <br />    engine. The details of these and other experi- ments <br />demonstrated <br />  by <br />    Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.</p>
<p>    Bogar's guru, Kālāngi Nāthar, is believed to be a Chinese who <br />    attained siddhi in South India and thus became included among <br />the <br />    Eighteen Siddhars.</p>
<p>    Lao Tse - the founder of Taoism (5th century B.C.) was the first <br />    Chinese to propound the theory of duality of matter -- the male <br />  Yang <br />    and female Yin -- which conforms to the Siddha concept of Shiva -</p>
<p>    Shakti or positive-negative forces. This very same concept was <br />  first <br />    revealed by the adi-siddhar Agasthya Rishi, whose period is as <br />old <br />    as the Vedas, which have been conservatively dated at 3500 B.C. <br />  Also <br />    alchemy as a science was practised in China only after B.C. 135 <br />  and <br />    was practiced as an art until B.C. 175 when a royal decree was <br />    enacted banning alchemical preparation of precious metals by the <br />    Celestial Empire; these details are recounted in the two <br />existing <br />    Chinese books of alchemy Shih Chi and Treatise of Elixir Refined <br />  in <br />    Nine Couldrons, both dated to the first century B.C.</p>
<p>    The emergence of Lao Tse with his theory of duality of matter <br />and <br />    the journey of Bhogar to China seem to have taken place about <br />the <br />    same time and it is even possible that Bhogar himself went under <br />  the <br />    name of Lao Tse in China, like another Siddharishi Sriramadevar, <br />  who <br />    was known as Yacob in Arabia.</p>
<p>    This seems likely considering that: before Lao Tse the concept <br />of <br />    duality of matter finds no mention in any Chinese treatise; <br />  alchemy <br />    as a science emerged only after B.C. 135, i.e. four centuries <br />  after <br />    Lao Tse; there was a sudden spurt of alchemical practice aher <br />the <br />    emergency of Lao Tse; and the duality of matter and alchemy have <br />    been mentioned in South Indian scriptures that antidate Lao Tse <br />by <br />    centuries.</p>
<p>    Bogar anticipating that in due course of period, human beings <br />will <br />    suffer from large number of disease. As an expert in medicine he <br />    used 4448 rare herbs and made 9 poisonous medicine, mixing these <br />9 <br />    poisons into one needs great knowledege and skill, to make a <br />  Master <br />    Medicine ( One medicine to cure all disease ). Thirumoolar also <br />    discuss one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. <br />With <br />    the consultation of Agasthiar ( Father of Ayurvedic Medicine) <br />and <br />    other siddhars Bogar mixed the 9 poisons ( Nava Bashanam ) and <br />  made <br />    the Master Medicine in the form of Lord Murugan which is <br />currently <br />    worshiped at Palani Murugan temple. There is a place near Palani <br />    Hill called Thanasiappan Temple which is the place were Bogar <br />  mixed <br />    the Nava Bashanam and made the Murugan idol.</p>
<p>    Bogar and others then decided that by using the milk and <br />    panchamirtham ( a sweet recipe ) poured on the idol, one can <br />  extract <br />    the medicine from the idol. The milk and panchamritham then <br />  becomes <br />    medicine to cure disease. After installing Lord Murugan <br />  Navabashana <br />    idol at the Palani Hill, Bogar used to worship it with milk <br />    abishegam ( pouring milk on the idol ) and panchamirtha <br />abishegam <br />  ( <br />    pouring panchamirtham on the idol ).</p>
<p>    His disciple Pulipani siddhar then took over the job of Lord <br />  Murugan <br />    pooja after Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi - the highest <br />  samadhi <br />    stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy. Bogar <br />    Samadhi is inside Palani Murugan temple at Palani Hill. Actually <br />    Bogar himself constructed his samadhi exactly under the Lord <br />  Murugan <br />    Navabasha idol and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi there. The <br />  entrance <br />    to his samadhi is a cave like structure, now also worship for <br />this <br />    great siddhar is conducted at this entrance where he is last <br />seen <br />  by <br />    his disciples which is at the Palani temple. The shrine at the <br />top <br />    of the hill, though later than the Tiru Avinankudi temple, has <br />    overshadowed the older temple in the present century due to its <br />    popular appeal. Created by Bhogar, it was maintained after him <br />by <br />    sage Pulippani and his descendants almost as their personal and <br />    private temple.</p>
<p>    During the time of Tirumalai Nayak, his general Ramappayyan <br />handed <br />    over the puja rights to newly brought Brahmin priests. The <br />    descendants of Pulippani were compensated for the loss of this <br />  right <br />    by being given: Certain duties of superintendence Right to some <br />    annual presents Right to shoot off, at the Dasara Festival, the <br />    arrow which symbolises Subramanya's victory over asuras. Right <br />to <br />  be <br />    buried at the foot of the steps leading to the hill, if some of <br />  them <br />    so chose.</p>

<p>      Bodhidharma (early 6th century CE) was the Buddhist monk <br />      traditionally credited as founder of Zen. Very little <br />  contemporary <br />      biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and <br />  subsequent <br />      accounts became layered with legend, but most accounts agree <br />  that <br />    he <br />      was a South Indian monk who journeyed to southern China and <br />      subsequently relocated northwards. Some claim Daruma <br />Bodhidharma <br />      (Chinese: Ta Mo; Japanese: Daruma) was the third child of the <br />      Pallava king Sugandan from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>      The Yi Jin Jing credits Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma, which <br />    would <br />      make him an important influence on the martial arts of Asia in <br />      general. However, both the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu to <br />      Bodhidharma and the authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing itself <br />have <br />    been <br />      discredited by historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and <br />  Matsuda <br />      Ryuchi. </p>
<p>      Huiguang and Sengchou were expert in the martial arts before <br />  they <br />      became two of the very first Shaolin monks…quot;years before <br />the <br />    arrival <br />      of Bodhidharma.The Taishō TripiṦamp;shy;aka documents <br />Sengchou's skill <br />    with <br />      the tin staff.</p>
<p>      Bodhidharma is associated with the idea that spiritual, <br />    intellectual <br />      and physical excellence are an indivisible whole necessary for <br />      enlightenment. Such an approach to enlightenment ultimately <br />  proved <br />      highly attractive to the Samurai class in Japan, who made Zen <br />    their <br />      way of life, following their encounter with the martial-arts-<br />      oriented Zen Rinzai School introduced to Japan by Eisai in the <br />    12th <br />      century. Yet in some versions of his legend, Bodhidharma's <br />focus <br />    was <br />      so single-minded during his nine years of meditation that his <br />  legs <br />      atrophied</p>

<p>  Nakkirar is of third sangam...as there is no proof for existence of<br />  first two sangams.....<br />  The three sangam concepts were only introduced by Nakkirar some <br />where<br />  between 6-9th century in his commentary to Iraivanar Agaporul....<br />  None of the literature before has any reference to three<br />  sangams...even in sangam literature there is no reference...</p>
<p>  There are reference in Jain sources that Jains started a Sangam for<br />  Tamil in Madurai...<br />  There are also reference here and there that there might have been<br />  committee of poets setup in and around Madurai ....<br />  So the possiblity is there was some kind of Academy of poets in<br />  Madurai and surely it was not as big and as organized as it is <br />quoted<br />  by Nakkirar(i.e the three sangam lasted for so many thousand years)</p>
<p>  No idea about Bogar as of now....But there are more myths than <br />facts<br />  concerned with Bogar.</p>

<p>    Mr.Vairam, revisiting the older thread, has there been any study <br />of <br />    the St.Bogar and his uruva vazhipadu of Lord Muruga compared to <br />the <br />    1st sangam age? <br />    Any documentation of Bogar's time line to Nakeerar or pallava <br />    dynasty, i would be curious.</p>

<p>      Vairam,</p>
<p>      Thanks for the post. When I read the tamil lines from your <br />site, i <br />    was wondering about the <br />      intro given. None of the two stanza's talk anything about <br />    criticizing a community (atleast <br />      to my knowledge). Both are very generic and a common trend in <br />any <br />    of the sitthar songs</p>
<p>      First stanza is to all those who belive in temple and god. <br />Second <br />    is just a comparison to <br />      say that all are equal. Even many sanskrit slakas use this <br />method <br />    of comparison.</p>
<p>      Can you post the full song and the translation from the book <br />are <br />    quoting this? Please post <br />      from Kamil, what reason he has given to say that these verses <br />were <br />    criticizing brahmin <br />      dominated community?</p>
<p>      Just curious to know about the prevailing trend of those <br />years. </p>
<p>      Regards,<br />      Satish</p>

<p>        Original Tamil poems are in the blog<br />        <a href="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/17/civakaviyam2/" title="http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/17/civakaviyam2/">http://karkanirka.wordpress.com/2008/05/17/civakaviyam2/</a></p>
<p>        Civakaviyar is one of Cittars who heavily criticized the <br />Brahmin<br />        dominated society and caste system of his period. I have <br />given two<br />        poems below which echo this feelings,</p>
<p>        In bricks and in granite,</p>
<p>        in the red rubbed lingam,</p>
<p>        in copper and brass,</p>
<p>        is Siva's adobe-</p>
<p>        thats what you tell us,</p>
<p>        and you are wrong.</p>
<p>        Stay where you are</p>
<p>        and study your own selves.</p>
<p>        Then you will BECOME</p>
<p>        the Temple of GOD,</p>
<p>        full of his dance and spell</p>
<p>        and song.</p>
<p>        ??..<br />        ?..<br />        ..</p>
<p>        What does it mean - a Pariah woman?</p>
<p>        What does it mean - a Brahmin women?</p>
<p>        Is there any difference in flesh,</p>
<p>        skin,or bones?</p>
<p>        Do you feel any difference when you sleep</p>
<p>        with a Pariah or Brahmin woman?</p>
