</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam, karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has not beenreplaced by buddhism,saivism,vaishnavism,islam or christian waves in tamilcountry. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements have notimmobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large in tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>
<p>gandhram<br />chidambaram</p>

          &quot;thee midhi &quot; and some reminisences at chidambaram        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a strategy for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite safety measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places you can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your feet is whatit needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has nothing to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few laughs :))</p>

<p>              Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faith<br />        and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of<br />        accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the appeal does<br />        not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on person's<br />        feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be<br />        anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as these.</p>
<p>              There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not<br />        possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark of<br />        unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked bythe<br />        Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worship in Tamil<br />        nadu..</p>
<p>                But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique" practice<br />        separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism ishighly<br />        flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style of<br />        viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not as whole<br />        and holistic..</p>
<p>                In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is indicative<br />        of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped durign this<br />        festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi amman, Kali<br />        amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman, Draupadi<br />        amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all these<br />        ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy and<br />        great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />        Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part of<br />        Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take literally<br />        thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her devotees in<br />        each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised. Mariamman is<br />        mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi Devi in<br />        these verses!</p>
<p>                ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is Shiva's<br />        emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in most of<br />        the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers shout<br />        "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the poster say<br />        that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktismand<br />        Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that trasncends the<br />        ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so blatantly<br />        visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that calls for<br />        great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the<br />        forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in<br />        chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner<br />        temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in<br />        chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people<br />        than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the<br />        remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam,<br />        karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of<br />        these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from<br />        the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these<br />        people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the<br />        masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has<br />        not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves<br />        in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements<br />        have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>                hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and largein<br />        tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />                i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district<br />        pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>                in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500years<br />        of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>              But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique" practice<br />      separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism is highly<br />      flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial style of<br />      viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not aswhole<br />      and holistic..</p>
<p>              In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is indicative<br />      of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is worshipped durign this<br />      festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi amman,Kali<br />      amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman, Draupadi<br />      amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all these<br />      ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy and<br />      great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga<br />      Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part of<br />      Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will take literally<br />      thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her devotees in<br />      each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised. Mariamman is<br />      mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi Devi in<br />      these verses!</p>
<p>              ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is Shiva's<br />      emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and in most of<br />      the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers shout<br />      "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does the poster say<br />      that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktism and<br />      Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>              Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that trasncends the<br />      ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so blatantly<br />      visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that calls for<br />      great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>              friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the<br />      forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>              last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking)in<br />      chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner<br />      temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in<br />      chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>              no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people<br />      than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the<br />      remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>              the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam,<br />      karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of<br />      these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostlyfrom<br />      the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these<br />      people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>              a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the<br />      masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>              mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has<br />      not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves<br />      in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements<br />      have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>              hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large in<br />      tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />              i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district<br />      pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>              in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years<br />      of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>    Dear Natarajan, I didn't mean all forms of extreme devotion as 'stunt'<br />    sorry for the misunderstanding, I only deem them unnecessary. Just fyi to<br />    you a huge number of thee midhis are used as stunts almost arranged like<br />    circus with an organiser and participant, soon after the participants are<br />    whisked away so that audience does not see any injuries on her foot. Usually<br />    these are very poor women doing it for a living. It is not related to<br />    authentic devotion in the least and those of us who believe also must<br />    strongly discourage.</p>

<p>      Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be like an<br />    acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is relative. I can neverdare<br />    to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt.</p>

<p>          Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faith<br />    and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of<br />    accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the appeal does<br />    not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on person's<br />    feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be<br />    anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as these.</p>
<p>          There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not<br />    possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Natarajan, I didn't mean all forms of extreme devotion as 'stunt' sorry for the misunderstanding, I only deem them unnecessary. Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  to you ahuge number of thee midhis are used as stunts almost arranged like circus with an organiser and participant, soon after the participants are whisked away so that audience does not see any injuries on her foot. Usually these are very poor women doing it for a living. It is not related to authentic devotion in the least and those of us who believe also must strongly discourage.</p>

<p>      Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faithand great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the appeal does not goaway. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on person's feet inKovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as these.</p>
<p>      There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

The "Amman" that is worshipped durign this festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz.? Sakthi amman,Kali amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman, Draupadi amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all these ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy and great mystic symbolism.?? In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part of Markandeya Purana? in its last chapter states taht Devi will take literally thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her devotees in each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.??

<p>        friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on theforthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>        last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>        no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>        the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam,karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>        a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>        mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>        hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large in tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />        i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>        in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>    Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faith and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the appeal does not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on person's feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as these.</p>

<p>      friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>      last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>      no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>      the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam, karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>      a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the masses.a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>      mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>      hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large in tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />      i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>      in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>      friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>      last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>      no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>      the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam, karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>      a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the masses.a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>      mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>      hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large in tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />      i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>      in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>  Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faith andgreat courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the appeal does not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on person's feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as these.</p>
<p>  There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not possible inKaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

          &quot;thee midhi &quot; and some reminisences at chidambaram        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of unflinching faith and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to lot of accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that the appeal does not go away.I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds on person's feet in Kovaiduring thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK protests may be anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such as these.</p>
<p>There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith is not possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>  friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>  last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>  no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>  the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam, karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>  a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>  mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements havenot immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>  hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large in tamilnadu.if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />  i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district pocketsand some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>  in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

          &quot;thee midhi &quot; and some reminisences at chidambaram        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>On sharing the contents of this mail in some other group, I received this reply from:http://jataayu.blogspot.com/</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>?<br />The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a hallmark of unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually mocked by the Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti worship in Tamil nadu.. <br />?<br />But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some "unique" practice separatefrom Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream Hinduism is highly flawed..and is probably a result of Euro-Christian-colonial style of viewing Hinduculture only as bits and pieces and fragment and not as whole and holistic.. <br />?<br />In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual is indicative of its holistic Hindu character.? The "Amman" that is worshipped durign this festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz.? Sakthi amman, Kali amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani amman, Draupadi amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites* all these ammansis the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep philosophy and great mystic symbolism.?? In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called Durga Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship which is part of Markandeya Purana? in its last chapter states taht Devi will take literally thousands ofincarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless her devotees in each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.?? Mariamman is mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as Vaishnavi Devi in these verses! <br />?<br />... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that is Shiva's emblem?and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount? .. and in most of the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the firewalkers shout "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire..? So, how does the poster say that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism? <br />?<br />Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that trasncends the ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is so blatantly visiblein other religions/cultures..? It is *this fact* that calls for great pride and celebration! </p>

<p>friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam, karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has not beenreplaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or christian waves in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>

          &quot;thee midhi &quot; and some reminisences at chidambaram        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice event on the forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire walking) in chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the street corner temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman temples in chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to the people than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman followers. only the remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal kudam oorvalam, karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are halmark of these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are mostly from the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness among these people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation of the masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing tradition which has not beenreplaced by buddhism,saivism,vaishnavism,islam or christian waves in tamilcountry. even the modern atheistic or liberal religious movements have notimmobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil community.</p>
<p>hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and large in tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping ofcourse.<br />i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem rural district pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of kalvarayn hills.</p>
<p>in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after 2500 years of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>
