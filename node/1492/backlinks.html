<p>(1) The Re-Emergence of the Chola Kingdom</p>
<p>gradually re-emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty of Tamilnadu, after <br />a long spell of nearly six centuries both in political obscurity and <br />as feudatory of the Kalabra, Pallava and Pandiya dynasties of South <br />India.</p>
<p>(2) Vijayaalaya Chola reigns from his capital Palaiyaarai in Tamilnadu</p>
<p>In the line of these Cholas sprung king Vijayaalaya Chola (A.D.849-<br />881) ruling a small central region of the present Tamilnadu state <br />with his capital at Palaiyaarai, and as a feudatory of the Pallava <br />king Nandivarman - 3 (A.D.826-850).</p>
<p>(3) Vijayaalaya Chola builds his new capital at Thanjaavur</p>
<p>In the year A.D.852 Vijayaalaya Chola waged war with the Muttaraiyar <br />king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring east, and <br />captured his territory of Thanjaavur.</p>
<p>Vijayalaya Chola built his new capital at Thanjaavur with all <br />facilities of a city commencing with the construction of a temple to <br />the Goddess Kaali named as Nisumbasudani. The Chola country of this <br />period covered the central and the eastern regions of the present <br />Tamilnadu state.</p>
<p>(4) King of Sri Lanka awaits to avenge the invasion of his country by <br />Pandiya</p>
<p>During this period the Sri Lankan king Sena-2 (A.D.851-885) was <br />awaiting an opportune moment to avenge the devastation and disgrace <br />caused to Sri Lanka by an earlier invasion of the Pandiya king <br />Srimara Sri Vallaba (A.D.835-862) which took place during the rule of <br />Sena-1(A.D.831-851). </p>
<p>(5) Rebellious son of Pandiya seeks help from Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Towards this time a son of Srimara Sri Vallaba by one of his other <br />queens, named Maya Pandiya claimed rights to succession against <br />Varaguna Pandiya-2 the legitimate heir to the throne by the chief <br />queen of Srimara Sri Vallaba. This son with dissension with his <br />father over same resolved to take over the Pandiya kingdom to himself <br />and went to Sri Lanka to seek the assistance of the king Sena-2.</p>
<p>(6) Sri Lankan forces invades and captures the Pandiya country</p>
<p>Taking opportunity of the prevailing conditions, the king of Sri <br />Lanka the Sena-2 sent a large army under his general named Kutthaka, <br />who crossed seas from the port of Mahatittha the present Mantota and <br />invaded the Pandiya country in the year A.D.862, killed Srimara Sri <br />Vallaba laid waste the region, and captured the capitol city of the <br />Pandiya the Madurai. However Varaguna Pandiya ? 2 escaped capture and <br />went into hiding. </p>
<p>(7) The Sri Lankan forces crown the rebellious son on the Pandiya <br />throne</p>
<p>The Sri Lankan forces thereafter anointed as the king the rebellious <br />son of Srimara Sri Vallaba the Maya Pandiya who seeked their <br />assistance to gain the throne, and returned to Sri Lanka with much of <br />the earlier lost treasures of the Sinhala country.</p>
<p>(8) Pallava king Nirupatunga assists Varaguna to regain throne</p>
<p>Varaguna Pandiya-2 requested the assistance of the Pallava king <br />Nirupatunga (A.D.850-882) to retrieve his throne. The Pallava king <br />along with Vijayaalaya Chola and his allies invaded and defeated the <br />rebellious son of Pandiya and drove away the remaining Sinhala forces <br />and reinstated Varaguna Pandiya - 2 (A.D.862-880) on throne at <br />Madurai in the year A.D.862.</p>
<p>(9) Aathiththa Chola ascends the Chola throne</p>
<p>Vijayaalaya Chola appointed his son Aathiththa Chola (A.D.871-907) as <br />his co-regent in the year A.D.871. He succeeded on the Chola throne <br />at Thanjavur in the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayaalaya <br />Chola.  </p>
<p>(10) Aathiththa Chola recovers the regions of the Chola country </p>
<p>During his period in the year A.D.880 Varaguna Pandiya - 2 waged war <br />with the Pallava king Nirupathunga successor to Nandivarman, with <br />whom he had friendly relations earlier. The Aathitha Chola assited <br />the Pallavas against Pandiya in this war at Thiruppurambiam. The <br />Pallavas won the battle and Aathiththa Chola too was benefitted by <br />being able to recover the entire Chola country. In the year A.D. 890 <br />he invaded and captured the Thondainadu and put an end to the Pallava <br />dynasty with Aparajitha (A.D.882-890) the son of Nirupathunga. </p>
<p>(11) Paranthaha Chola captures the Pandiya kingdom</p>
<p>Athiththa died while in Thondainadu, and was suceeded by his son king <br />Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-954) at Thanjavur, who in the year A.D.910 <br />captured the Pandiya country the southern region of the present Tamil <br />Nadu state. The Pandiya king Rajasimhan-3 (A.D.905-921) few years <br />after his defeat, escaped from his hiding to Sri Lanka and requested <br />the Sinhala king Kasyappa-5 (A.D.913-923) to assist him in regaining <br />his kingdom.</p>
<p>(12) Pandiya King's second battle with Paranthaha Chola</p>
<p>In the year A.D.919 king Kasyappa sent a large Sinhala force under <br />his general Saka Senapathi to assist Rajasimhan to recapture his <br />kingdom. However Paranthaha's forces along with the forces of his <br />ally the Kannada king Piruthivi-2, defeated the combined forces of <br />Pandiya and the Sinhala forces, in a deadly battle at Vellur. </p>
<p>(13) Pandiya King escapes to Sri Lanka with Regalia</p>
<p>However the Pandiya king Rajasimhan escaped capture by Cholas, and <br />went to Sri Lanka with his crown and the other royal insignia and <br />took shelter in the Sinhala kingdom. He seeked further assistance <br />from the new Sinhala king Dappula-4 (A.D.923-934) in regaining his <br />kingdom. He on not receiving favourable response from Dappula-4 due <br />to heavy repraisels from his nobles against same, left back his crown <br />and insignia with him, and took asylum in the Chera country the <br />present south Kerala state.</p>
<p>(14) Paranthaha Chola wages war with Sri Lanka.  </p>
<p>Paranthaha Chola now requested the next successor to the Sri Lanka <br />throne the Udaya-3 (A.D.934-937) to return the Pandiya crown and <br />insignia, and on the latter's refusal Paranthaha in the year A.D.944 <br />crossed seas to Sri Lanka, and defeated the king Udaya-3 who <br />retreated from his capital Anuradhapura to Rohana in south Sri Lanka <br />with the Pandiyan treasure.</p>
<p>(15) Paranthaha Chola fails in his mission</p>
<p>Paranthaha finding difficult to penetrate into Rohana returned to <br />Chola country with much booty and treasures from Lanka, but failing <br />in his mission to retrieve the Pandiyan crown and royal insignia from <br />king Udaya-3. However Paranthaha with the defeat of the Sinhala king <br />assumed the new title the Singhalanthahan.</p>
<p>(16) Gandarathiththa Chola looses Pandiya Country </p>
<p>Paranthaha-1 was suceeeded on the Chola throne at Thanjavur by his <br />second son Gandarathiththa Chola (A.D.950-957), who spent almost his <br />entire period of rule in spiritualism as an ardent Saivite, and <br />finally was counted as one of the 63 great Saiva Saints of TamilNadu.</p>
<p>(17) Arinjaya's short rule of Chola kingdom</p>
<p>He was followed by his younger brother Arinjaya Chola (A.D956-957) at <br />Thanjavur, who had very short rule.</p>
<p>(18) Chola Forces goes to Sri Lanka to assist the Commander Sena</p>
<p>He was followed by his son Sundera Chola (A.D.957-973) on the throne <br />at Thanjavur. During this period the Sri Lankan commander with much <br />animosity with his own king Sena-5 (A.D972-981) came to Chola country <br />and seeked military assistance from Sundera Chola, who sent as much <br />as 95,000 troops to Sri Lanka led by thr Chola General Paranthahan <br />Siriya Velan in A.D.954.</p>
<p>(19) Chola General Meets his death in the battle in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>In this battle Sena-5 was defeated and escaped to Rohana, but the <br />Chola commander met his death which made the forces to return to <br />their country.</p>
<p>(20) Rule of Utthama Chola </p>
<p>After the death of Sundera Chola in A.D.973 the lawful successor <br />prince Rajaraja Chola gave way to his paternal uncle Utthama Chola <br />(A.D.973-985) who was craving for the Chola throne, on the <br />understanding that the succession to the throne at Thanjavur to be <br />passed on to prince Rajaraja after the death of Utthama Chola.</p>
<p>(21) Rajaraja-1 succeeds on the Chola throne</p>
<p>Likewise in the the year A.D.985 Rajaraja ? 1 came into power. During <br />this period in Sri Lanka king Mahinda-V (A.D.981-1029) ruling from <br />Anuradhapura in the wake of an internal rebellion by the Kerala <br />mercineries of his troops retreated to Rohana in A.D.991, and <br />continued to rule the southern half of the island.</p>
<p>This left the northern half in turmoil with no king for nearly eleven <br />years with various chieftains yeilding power from time to time over <br />territories in this region and a state of anarchy prevailed. Rajaraja <br />taking advantage of the situation crossed seas and invaded Sri Lanka <br />in his seventeenth year the A.D.1002. His great army known <br />as "muntrukai mahasenai' sacked the seaport city of Mathottam the <br />present Mantota and the interior capital of Anuradhapura, and annexed <br />the northen half of the island to his empire.</p>
<p>Rajaraja too on his victory over the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka assumed <br />the a new title as Sinhalanthahan, and a village in Thanjavur in <br />Tamilnadu was named after this title as Singalanthahacchcheri.</p>
<p>(22) Polonnaruwa made the Chola capital in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>He named the captured northern half of Sri Lanka as Mummudi-<br />Cholamandalam after another of his titles, and further divided and <br />named them into various provinces. The present Polonnaruwa which <br />formed a part of the province Nigarili Cholavalanadu was made the new <br />capital of his island territorial possessions and was named as <br />Jananathamangalam also known as Jananathapuram.</p>
<p>(23) Tamil Trading Settlements established in Sri Lanka  </p>
<p>During this period of Chola occupation the Tamil trading guilds <br />Thisaiayiratthu Annuruvar also known as Nanadesi Thisaiayirathu <br />Annuruvar and Nanadesis, the Valanjiyar and Nagaratthar who were <br />already trading in Sri Lanka further increased their activities in <br />the Island.</p>
<p>At Kataneri the present Vahalkade in the Anuradhapura district the <br />guild of Thisaiayyiratththu Annuruvar established a mercantile town <br />known as Virapattinam. Among the members of this guild was a trader <br />of high rank named Kanavathi Cholan alias Mavittamuriparan, a Chetti <br />trader from Java and an officer in charge of a mint in this town.</p>
<p>At Padaviya in the Anuradhapura district too there was a trading <br />establishment of this guild , and also a Siva temple in this area <br />under their protection. One of the traders here too was of a high <br />rank in the trading guild named Uththama Cholan alias Mandalattu <br />Chetti, and another named Kottaikutpatan Cholan alias Kollarun Cinkan.</p>
<p>At Viharehinna near Moragolla in north Matale district <br />Thisaiayiratthu Annuruvar had established another mercantile town <br />known as the Virapattinam.</p>
<p>There had been further trading establishements of this guild at <br />Ilakattu Eba in Chilaw district, and at Detiyamulla and Gaitenpitiya <br />both in Kurunagala district.</p>
<p>In Polonnaruwa near the Rankot Vihara there had been a Buddhist <br />Vihare known as Bholapalli at the village Bahicintai under the <br />patronage of the guild of Thisaiayiraathu Annuruvar.</p>
<p>(24) Chola officials build Hindu Temples in Sri Lanka  </p>
<p>During this period Chola Officials and Tamil traders built many Hindu <br />Temples for worship of Siva and Vishnu in the northern half of Sri <br />Lanka.</p>
<p>A Siva temple was built at Jananathamangalam also known as <br />Jananathpuram the present Polonnaruwa in the province of Nigarili <br />Cholavalanadu alias Pulainari, and was named as Vanavanmadevi Iswarem <br />after the queen of Raja Raja - 1.</p>
<p>They built another Sive temple at Padaviya in the Anuradhapura <br />disctrict and named it as Ravikulamaanikka Iswarem after one of the <br />titles of Rajaraja. Many Chola officials and traders around fifteen <br />of them have made endowements to this temple, and Chenkulavan <br />Katampan being one of them made donations in the year A.D.1005.</p>
<p>A further Siva Temple was built at Padaviya and was named as <br />Uththamar Koyil and there was also a brahmin settlement established <br />in this area known as `Sripathi grama'</p>
<p>There was yet another Siva temple constructed at Atakade in the <br />Anuradhapura district and named as Uththama Chola Iswarem after the <br />Rajarja's predecessor to the Chola throne.</p>
<p>Chola officials also established settlements of Brahmin priests on <br />the lands of Rajavichadira valanadu covering the present Kantalai in <br />the Trincomalee district, and named it as Rajaraja <br />Chathurvedimangalam.</p>
<p>The region of Mathottam in Mannar alias Arunmolideva Valanadu was <br />renamed as Rajarajapuram, and a Siva temple was constructed by Nallur <br />Kilavan Taalikkumaran a Chola Officer in Sri Lanka during this <br />period, and was named as Rajaraja Iswarem. He also made arrangements <br />to celeberate the annual festival of Vaikasi Visakam elaborately at <br />this temple every year in the month of May. </p>
<p>During this period Cholas built another Siva temple at Rajarajapuram <br />alias Mathottam the present Mannar district and named it as <br />Thiruraameeswarem.</p>
<p>The artisans from the Chola country who came to Sri Lanka during this <br />period were employed in the construction of these temples and in the <br />casting of the bronze statues of Hindu deities for their shrines.</p>
<p>(25) Mathotam made a seaport city of Cholas</p>
<p>The village of Mathottam alias Rajarajapuram in Mannar being the <br />closest port of call to the Chola warriors from the mainland <br />developed into an important city with many highways. One of these <br />highways was named as Rajaraja perumtheru. Another highway from this <br />city lead to Arulmolithevavalanadu apparently the present <br />Anuradhapura. </p>
<p>The Chola Officers also built an irrigation tank near Iluppaikkadavai <br />known as Cholamandalakkulam, north of Mathottam in the Mannar <br />district. There had been many weaving looms in this city and tax <br />collectors collected tax on these weaving looms and for transport <br />through the highways.</p>
<p>(26) Chola Officers rebuild Buddhist Temple in Trincomalee</p>
<p>Chola officers further re-constructed Velgam Vihare also known as <br />Sadda Vihare, a Buddhist Temple at the present Tincomalee district, <br />and named it as Rajaraja Perumpalli. The location of this Buddhist <br />temple which was earlier known as Panchasanthulagama was renamed as <br />Sthavayasa Ramyana Manavatinanadu. The region of Trincomalee which <br />formed a Chola province was known as Melaithuru Sriyathan Parakesari <br />Valanadu.</p>
<p>(27) Village revenues from Sri Lanka for Chola Temple </p>
<p>Rajaraja in the year A.D.1011 donated the revenues from the villages <br />Maappisimbu Kottiyara re-named as Rajaraja Valanadu, and Kannakkan <br />Kottiyara re-named as Vikkrama Cholavalanadu both in the Trincomalee <br />district, for the upkeep of the great Rajarajeswarem Temple built by <br />him at Thanjavur in the Chola country in Tamilnadu, a stupendous <br />masterpiece and a living monument of the Chola Temple architecture <br />dedicated to God Siva. </p>
<p>(28) Chola emperor Rajaraja issues new coinage in Sri Lanka.  </p>
<p>Rajaraja during his rule of north Sri Lanka issued gold coins with <br />the legend "Sri Rajaraja" inscribed on them. These were equivalent to <br />ten kalanju or units of gold. There were also coins issued in base <br />metal having the same legend Rajaraja. He also issued a base gold <br />coin called the Madai, and the coin too bore his name Sri Rajarja in <br />Nagari letters. </p>
<p>(29) Further Hindu Temples built in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>During the rule of Rajaraja more Hindu temples were continued to be <br />built at Polonnaruwa, Padaviya, and Mantota and charitable endowments <br />were made to them by Traders and Chola Officers stationed in Sri <br />Lanka. In the year A.D.1013 endowments were made by a Chola officer <br />Arankan Iramesan to Utthamachola Iswarem built earlier at Atakada.</p>
<p>(30) Rajendra Chola ascends the throne as the next Chola Emperor </p>

<p>It appears around this time time there had been a Buddhist temple at <br />Auradhapura named Madhavan Makothai Palli to which Tamil Artisons etc <br />jointly did renovations.</p>
<p>It appears it was during this time the Cholas exacavated a tank named <br />as Cholamandalakkulam on the east and in the close proximity to the <br />present Iluppaikkadavai in Mannar district. </p>
<p>In A.D.1033 (10th year) during the viceroyalty of Sri Sangavanmar <br />Udayar Chola Ilangeswara, the officials of high office (perunguri <br />perumakkal) of Rajraja Chathurvedimangalam encompassing the Rajendra <br />cholavalandu and Rajavitchadira valanadu at the present Kantalai in <br />Trincomalee district, met at the Siva shrine known as Muththangai <br />temple, and diiscussed and approved the plans for inprovising more <br />facilities from the irrigation channel named Vikkrama Chola vaikkal <br />named after one of Rajendra's titles.</p>

All <br />his treasures were transported to the Chola kingdom and consequently <br />he commited suicide.</p>
<p>During this time Vikkrama Pandian the son of Mahalanakitti born to a <br />Pandian queen from Tamilnadu fled to India.</p>

<p>Rajendra sent an expedition to Sri Lanka defeated and killed <br />Virasalamehan and took the two sons of Manabharna as captives. The <br />general Jeyamurinadalvar was left in command of the Chola forces <br />stationed in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>(59) Vijayabahu establishes himself at Rohana in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>During this period in Sri Lanka a local Kesadhatu chief named Kassapa <br />set up his rule at Rohana with his seat at Kataragama. (Kathirkamam).</p>
<p>The Chola general stationed at Polonnaruwa not withstanding this sent <br />an army to Kattaragama against Kasspa in which the Chola forces were <br />defeated and retreated to the north. Kassapa now set up his northern <br />frontier at Rakkhapasana the present Rakwana and returd to <br />Kattaragama.</p>
<p>At this time the prince named Kitti the nephew of Vikkramabahu with <br />his seat at Sippathalaka also in Rohana was taking efforts to <br />establish himself in this province. But Kassayappa sent his forces to <br />futile his attempt where he was defeated, and prince Kitti became the <br />ruler of Rohana with royal name Vijayabahu.</p>
<p>He then made preparations to wage war with the Cholas in north Sri <br />Lanka, but Virarajendra ordered the Chola general Jeyamurinadalvar <br />stationed at Polonnaruwa to invade Kataragama. The Chola forces <br />plundered Kataragama, but Vijayabahu escaped capture and the Chola <br />forces returned to Polonnaruwa. Vijayabahu again returned to <br />Sippatthalaka with strong forces and gradually established himself in <br />Rohona.</p>
<p>(60) Vijayabahu seeks military aid from Burma</p>
<p>He made fresh preparations to attack the Cholas, and sent a few years <br />prior to A.D.1067 envoys with rich presents to king Anuruddha <br />(A.D.1044-1077) of Pagan who was also the overlord of Rammanadesa <br />both being in present Burma, requesting for military assistance <br />against Cholas.</p>
<p>King Anuruddha on the other hand with no intention to create any <br />enmity with the powerful Cholas, and also to prevent any strain in <br />relations with Sri lanka, sent instead many ships with various <br />valuable gifts to king Vijayabahu, who now changed his abode to <br />Tambalagama.</p>
<p>(61) Virarajendra sends fresh expedition to Sri Lanka</p>
<p>During this period in north Sri Lanka many inhabitants grew hostile <br />and paid no tributes to the Chola kingdom. Vijayabahu too continued <br />with his attempts to oust Cholas from Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>This made Virarajendra to send a fresh expedition to Sri Lanka in the <br />year A.D.1067 with many ships of large forces to the port of <br />Mathottam in north Sri Lanka under the general Kurukulaththaraiyan.</p>
<p>He successfully brought the Mummudi Chola mandalam the northern half <br />of Sri Lanka under the Chola control. He then proceeded to Rohana <br />with his forces where two mighty warriors of Vijayabahu, Ravideva <br />and Cala joined the Chola forces and fought against him.</p>
<p>In this battle the Chola general Kurukulatharaiyan, and another <br />commander lost their lives. This made Chola forces more furious in <br />which Rohana again fell into the hands of the Cholas who took <br />Vijayabahu's queen captive with many treasures while he escaped to <br />his hideout. Again the whole of Sri Lanka came under the Chola rule.</p>
<p>(62) Virarajendra issues gold coin in Sri Lanka</p>

<p>His untimely death with no heir apparent to succeed paved way for <br />prince Rajendra of Vengi Nadu, as the next legitimate successor to <br />the Chola throne through his maternal side in the year A.D.1071 with <br />the royal title Kulotunga Chola.</p>
<p>(65) Vijayabahu saves Sri Lanka from Chola imperialism</p>
<p>During this period in Sri Lanka the king Vijayabahu who earlier hid <br />in the south after his defeat at the hands of the Cholas, gradually <br />establised himself at Mahanagahula in the present Ambalangoda in <br />south Sri Lanka, and struggled valiantly to relieve the island from <br />the long standing grip of Cholas.</p>
<p>In the year A.D.1088 he sent two seperate armies with large forces <br />simultaneously to the north-central province of Sri Lanka against the <br />Chola forces.</p>
<p>The first unit of his troops intially captured the Chola strongholds <br />at the villages Muhunnuru, Badalatthagalla, Vapinagara, Buddhigama, <br />Tilagulla, Mahagalla, all in the Dakkinadesa the present Kurunagala <br />district and proceeded to Anuradhapura. Here too Chola forces were <br />defeated and the city of Anuradhapura was captured . These troops <br />further perssued and defeated the Chola forces upto the seaport of <br />Mathottam alias Mahathittha in Mannar district.</p>
<p>The second unit of troops of Vijayabahu was directed to the eastern <br />province avoiding the mountainous regions which defeated the Chola <br />forces at Chagama in the south-central region of Sri lanka. When they <br />reached Pullathinagara the present Polonnnaruwa the Sinhala generals <br />requested Vijayabahu to join them quickly with further fresh forces.</p>
<p>Vijayabahu highly taken up by the heroic deeds of his forces <br />proceeded to Polonnaruwa with his valiant army from his town <br />Mahanugala. After the brief stay on the way in the close vicinity of <br />Mahiyangana Buddhist temple they reached Polonnaruwa along east coast.</p>
<p>The Chola forces stationed at various places in the close vicinity <br />all gathered immediately at Polonnaruwa and had a great battle with <br />Sinhala forces. Vijayabahu's two great warriors Ravideva and Cala who <br />joined the Chola forces earlier against him, now re-joined Vijayabahu <br />and fought with determination to exterminate the Cholas, and ending <br />up with the victory to Sinhala forces.</p>
<p>Vijayabahu to commemorate his victory over Cholas in Sri Lanka, <br />assumed the title "Satru Rajachola Kula-anthaha'.</p>
<p>(66) Vijayabahu marries the Kanyakubja Pricess </p>
<p>During this period the wife and the daughter of the north Indian king <br />Jegathipala who were taken prisoners to Chola country after defeat at <br />the hands of Rajadhiraja-1 earlier at Rohana, escaped from Chola <br />country and came back to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>They met the king Vijayabahu who later married the daughter <br />Leelawathie and took her as his first consort.</p>
<p>(67) KulothungaChola attempts peace with Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola on the reverse after a long weary expedition in the <br />far east seems to have decided to carry the balance regnal years in <br />peace and refrained from reacting further.</p>
<p>In confirming his friendly relations he sought the hands of the king <br />Vijayabahu's sister Mitta, but Vijayabahu with much animosity against <br />cholas preferred the Pandiya prince in marriage to his sister who <br />were long time allies of the sri Lankan kings.</p>
<p>(59) The beginning of the disintegration o the Chola empire</p>
<p>The loss of Sri Lanka from the fold of the cholas marked the <br />beginning of the gradual disintegration of the Chola overseas empire <br />from its healm during the rule of Virarajendra.</p>
<p>(60) King Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka plans war with Chola country</p>
<p>Kullotunga to strengthen the good relations with Sri Lanka sent <br />envoys with rich presents to king Vijayabahu. during this same period <br />the sinhala envoys who were on their way to Karnataka kingdom in the <br />Indian Mailand were humiliated in the Chola country by some natives.</p>
<p>Vijayabahu to avenge his anger over this incidence challenged <br />Kulotunga for war through the same Chola envoys and gathered his <br />troops at the seaports of Mathottam and Mattikavatatittha in the <br />present Mannar district in the year A.D.1089.</p>
<p>The Velaikkara forces of Chola who choose to stay back in Sri Lanka <br />and serve the Sinhala king after their defeat by Vijayabahu earlier <br />now revolted against him on his plan to wage war with thier <br />motherland.</p>
<p>In the revolt they caused destruction around Pullathinagara the <br />present Polonnaruwa and captured the king's sister Mitta with her <br />three sons. Vijayabahu escaped rebels and moved to south.</p>

          THE RELATIONS OF THE CHOLAS OF TAMIL NADU WITH THE SINHALAS OF S        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Anbulla thiru srihari,</p>
<p>Excellent and in depth information. Thanks for taking pains to refer <br />all the original references. Yours cliam that it was sattan pazhili <br />who was defeated by vijayalaya seems to be a very logical <br />conclusion. I will discuss this with Dr.Kalaikkovan further.</p>
<p>Vijayalaya choleeswaram - I understand - was built by one Ilango <br />aadi araiyan (aka semboodhi) - a muttaraiya chief. The temple <br />suffered some damage due to rains and was later renovated by Mallan <br />Viduman - again a muttaraiya chief. This info is available in the <br />inscription below the dwarapalakas of choleeswaram (Ref Early chola <br />art by SR Balasubramaniyam)</p>
<p>Possibly these people were chieftians to sattan pazhiyili or may be <br />even vijayalaya as you have noted. It is possible that the temple <br />was not actually known as vijayalaya choleeswaram as we find no <br />inscriptions of thanjai konda parakesari or any other chola <br />inscriptions.</p>
<p>This term choleeswaram comes from a much later inscription - which <br />you have quoted.</p>

          THE RELATIONS OF THE CHOLAS OF TAMIL NADU WITH THE SINHALAS OF S        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "S.Gokul" <seshadrigokul@y...  <br />wrote:</seshadrigokul@y...></p>
<blockquote><p>  Anbulla thiru.srihari, thiru.SB matrum nanbargalukku,</p>
<p>  I am unable to interact as much as I want to do, because of my <br />  current schedules. Mr.SB and Mr.Srihari are taking the group mails <br />  to new heights. Kudos to both.</p>
<p>  Mr.Srihari : The article on cholas and srilanka was wonderful. Very <br />  informative. I look forward to your final paper where you will <br />quote <br />  all the original sources. I am also looking forward to your <br />research <br />  articles for May and June.</p>
<p>  Will be grateful if you can indicate the source for just this info:</p>
<p>  You have said that Vijayalaya defeated sattan pazhiyili, the <br />  muttaraiya. This is a news to me. No early books could quote the <br />  name of the muttaraiya defeated by vijayalaya. I look forward to <br />the <br />  source of this info.</p>
<p>  In pudukkottai, there is a small hillock called naarthamalai in <br />  which two cave temples and one structural temple are seen. One of <br />  the cave temples as well as the structural temple seems to have <br />been <br />  built by sattan pazhiyili. The structural temple is called <br />  vijayalaya choleeswaram - based on a later record of pandiyan times.</p>
<p>  So I am really lost how a temple built by sattan pazhiyili came to <br />  be known as vijayalaya choleeswaram when there are no records of <br />  vijayalaya or even later chola kings.</p>
<p>  Mikka anbudan<br />  Gokul.S</p></blockquote>
<p>-----------------------</p>
<p>Anbulla Gokul avarkalukku vanakkam.</p>
<p>I am pleased to answer your two queries as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Two 8th century inscriptions of Muththaraiyars refer to these <br />kings as "Thanjaikkoan" and "Thanjai Natpuhalaalan" confirming that <br />Thanjavur region belonged to them. Epigraphica Indica Vol XXII - Page <br />142 &amp; 144</p>
<p>(2) The Thiruvalankaadu Copper Plates of Rajendra Chola - 1 says <br />clearly that "....In the illustrious family of that (king) was born <br />Vijayalaya of praise worthy prowess....He the light of the solar race <br />took possession of Thanjapuri...." South Indian Inscriptions Vol III, <br />Part III No: 205</p>
<p>(3) The inscription on a hero stone from Viracholapuram in <br />Thirukkoyilur Taluk says "....Ta(n)chai kotta Koparakesaripa[n]ma[r]<br />kku yandu 3...."<br />In the above undoubtedly "kotta" should read as "konda" possibly a <br />reading error. Annual Report in Epigraphy - Madras 1935-1936, Page 72</p>
<p>(4) The Virarajendra Chola's inscription in Bagawathiamman temple in <br />Agatheeswarem in Kayakumasri district states "...Vijayalaya <br />constructed in the Chola country a town named Thanchapuri provided <br />with all the facilities of a new (city)". Travancore Archaeological <br />Series - Vol III, Part 1.</p>
<p>ruined mandapa in front of the rockcut shrine on Melamalai hill at <br />Narthamali region, we note the roch-cut shrine was known as Paliyili <br />Iswarem. The inscription reads as follows: "Hail prosperity! In the <br />seventh year of Kovisaiya Nirupatonga Vikkiramar. Great temple which <br />Sattan Paliyili son of Videlavidugu Muththaraiyan had excavated....I <br />Paliyili Siriyanangai made this (gift).....on behalf of God Rudra of <br />the Paliyili Iswarem...." Inscriptions in the Pudukkottai State by <br />Srinivasan, Part I, No: 19.</p>
<p>referred to as "Thajaiyarkon" and "Thanjai Natpuhalaalan" which <br />confirms that they were the kings of Thanjavur prior to the emergence <br />of the Cholas.</p>
<p>of Thanjapuri" form some other - whom we know were the Muththaraiyars <br />from reference (1)</p>
<p>year captured Thanjai. </p>
<p>But we also know from the time of Aathiththa Chola, that Thanjavur <br />was the capital of of Chola kings up to the time of Rajaraja Chola - <br />1.<br />Also we note from the time of Rajendra Chola - 1, even though <br />Gangaikonda Cholapuram was the new Chola capital city up to the time <br />the Pandiyan invasion by Sadaiyavarman Sundarapandiyan - the city <br />Thanjavur was still in the Chola fold. </p>
<p>We also know that Aathiththa Chola the son of Vijayalaya Chola and <br />was known as Rajakesaripanmar. Hence in the light of all the above <br />the Koparakesaripanmar referred above, and the only Chola king among <br />the medieval Cholas who had the neceesity to capture Thanjavur is <br />without any doubt was the Vijayalaya Chola, who captured Thanjavur in <br />his third year (850 + 3) A.D.853 from the Muththaraiyars and re-built <br />Thanjavur as his new capital [in lieu of Palaiyarai which was his <br />first capital] as seen from the reference (4). </p>
<p>Videlvidugu Muththaraiyan, leaving no doubt to any one that Sattan <br />Paliyili was in fact was a Muththaraiyar king even though the <br />inscription has not specifically mentioned of same. This inscription <br />was issued in the 7th year of he Pallava king Nirupathunga, that is <br />in (862+7)A.D.869. </p>
<p>The Thanjavur was captured by Vijayalaya in A.D.853 and the above <br />inscription of A.D.869 refers to the son, daughter, and son-in-law of <br />the Muththaraiyar king Sattan Paliyili making expansions and <br />endowments the Narthamalai rock-cut Siva temple excavated by Sattan <br />Paliyili and named Paliyili Iswarem. </p>
<p>Hence from the foregoing as we know the Muththaraiyar king who lived <br />closely to the time of the Vijayalaya's capture of Thanjavur was <br />Sattan Paliyili, undoubtedly he was the Muththaraiyar king defeated <br />by Vijayalaya Chola.</p>
<p>Further (Thiru Gokul) as mentioned by you one of the cave temples - <br />that is a rock-cut temple was "Sattan Paliyili Iswarem" excavated by <br />the Muththaraiyar king Sattan Paliyili.</p>
<p>But the structural temple built on Narthamalai is quite a different <br />temple from rock-cut (excavated) Paliyili Iswarem, and has nothing to <br />do with Sattan Paliyili or any other Muththaraiyar kings.</p>
<p>This granite structural Siva temple was built by a chief working <br />under Vijayalaya Chola after the capture of Thanjavur, and named it <br />after his king as Vijayalaya Choliswarem (Cholichcharem). <br />Inscriptions of Pudukkottai State - No 282. </p>
<p>Trust the foregoing informations are of interest to you.</p>
<p>Anbudan</p>
<p>Sri Hari.</p>

          THE RELATIONS OF THE CHOLAS OF TAMIL NADU WITH THE SINHALAS OF S        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear SriHari uncle,</p>
<p>Your articles are very informative.Thanks a lot &amp; Plz provide these <br />informations in detail. And...</p>
<p>will u tell me the reference book of this information:</p>
<blockquote><p>  In the year A.D.852 Vijayaalaya Chola waged war with the Muttaraiyar <br />  king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring east, and <br />  captured his territory of Thanjaavur.</p>
<p>Bcos..many books haven't mentioned the name of that "mutharaya </p></blockquote>
<p>king"... they simply mentioned.."a king named some mutharaya".</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  (14) Paranthaha Chola wages war with Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>  Paranthaha Chola now requested the next successor to the Sri Lanka <br />  throne the Udaya-3 (A.D.934-937) to return the Pandiya crown and <br />  insignia, and on the latter's refusal Paranthaha in the year A.D.944 <br />  crossed seas to Sri Lanka, and defeated the king Udaya-3 who <br />  retreated from his capital Anuradhapura to Rohana in south Sri Lanka <br />  with the Pandiyan treasure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is it true..? I referred one book"thennattu pOrgaL" which told <br />that it was "udaya-4". I dont know which one was correct . Can u clear my <br />doubt?</p>
<p>regards<br />kalpanasruthi</p>

          THE RELATIONS OF THE CHOLAS OF TAMIL NADU WITH THE SINHALAS OF S        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Anbulla thiru.srihari, thiru.SB matrum nanbargalukku,</p>
<p>I am unable to interact as much as I want to do, because of my <br />current schedules. Mr.SB and Mr.Srihari are taking the group mails <br />to new heights. Kudos to both.</p>
<p>Mr.Srihari : The article on cholas and srilanka was wonderful. Very <br />informative. I look forward to your final paper where you will quote <br />all the original sources. I am also looking forward to your research <br />articles for May and June.</p>
<p>Will be grateful if you can indicate the source for just this info:</p>
<p>You have said that Vijayalaya defeated sattan pazhiyili, the <br />muttaraiya. This is a news to me. No early books could quote the <br />name of the muttaraiya defeated by vijayalaya. I look forward to the <br />source of this info.</p>
<p>In pudukkottai, there is a small hillock called naarthamalai in <br />which two cave temples and one structural temple are seen. One of <br />the cave temples as well as the structural temple seems to have been <br />built by sattan pazhiyili. The structural temple is called <br />vijayalaya choleeswaram - based on a later record of pandiyan times.</p>
<p>So I am really lost how a temple built by sattan pazhiyili came to <br />be known as vijayalaya choleeswaram when there are no records of <br />vijayalaya or even later chola kings.</p>

<p>-----------------------</p>
<p>Anbulla SB avarkalukku vanakkam,</p>
<p>I intend to publish these two articles in a book form, after <br />polishing the language, the presentation, and the format - further, <br />but complete with the list of original and secondary sources from <br />which the informations have been gathered, the details of the <br />evidences and discussions on which the conclusions have been arrived <br />at, complete with all relevent photographs of Archaelogical monuments <br />&amp; maps connected with same.</p>
<p>However with my other involvements, I visualise that my above <br />ambition could only materialise towards the end of this year.</p>
