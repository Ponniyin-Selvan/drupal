<p>Need more information on Ramanujar<br />S.Balasubramani B+</p>
<p>In the year 1017 A.D., Ramanuja was born in the village of <br />Perumbudur, about twenty-five miles west of Madras. His father was <br />Kesava Somayaji and his mother was Kantimathi, a very pious and <br />virtuous lady. Ramanuja's Tamil name was Ilaya Perumal. Quite early <br />in life, Ramanuja lost his father. Then he came to Kancheepuram to <br />prosecute his study of the Vedas under one Yadavaprakasha, a teacher <br />of Advaita philosophy.</p>
<p>Ramanuja was a very brilliant student. Yadavaprakasha's <br />interpretations of Vedic texts were not quite up to his satisfaction. <br />Ramanuja pointed out many mistakes in the exposition of his master. <br />Sometimes he gave his own interpretations which were much liked by <br />all the co-students. This made Yadavaprakasha very jealous of <br />Ramanuja.</p>
<p>Yadavaprakasha made a plan to take away the life of Ramanuja. He <br />arranged for Ramanuja and his cousin Govinda Bhatta--a fellow student-<br />-a pilgrimage to Varanasi. Govinda Bhatta, being a favourite student <br />of Yadavaprakasha, came to know of the latter's plan while they were <br />travelling. He at once apprised Ramanuja of the danger and helped him <br />to escape. By the grace of God, Ramanuja escaped with the help of a <br />hunter and his wife whom he accidentally met on the way.<br />About the end of the tenth century, the Visishtadvaita system of <br />philosophy was well established in Southern India and the followers <br />of this creed were in charge of important Vaishnavite temples at <br />Kancheepuram, Srirangam, Tirupathi and other important places. The <br />head of the important Vaishnavite institution was Yamunacharya, a <br />great sage and profound scholar; and he was also the head of the Mutt <br />at Srirangam. One of his disciples, by name Kanchipurna, was serving <br />in the temple at Kancheepuram. Although a Sudra, Kanchipurna was so <br />very pious and good that the people of the place had great respect <br />and reverence for him. At present, there is a temple at Kancheepuram <br />where Kanchipurna's image has been installed and where he is <br />worshipped as a saint.</p>
<p>Young Ramanuja came under Kanchipurna's influence and had such <br />reverence for him that he invited him to dinner in his house. <br />Ramanuja's intention was to attend on Kanchipurna and personally <br />serve him at dinner and himself take meals afterwards. Unfortunately, <br />Kanchipurna came to dinner when Ramanuja was not at home, and took <br />his meals being served by Ramanuja's wife. When Ramanuja returned <br />home, he found the house washed and his wife bathing for having <br />served meals to a Sudra. This irritated Ramanuja very much and turned <br />him against his wife who was an orthodox lady of a different social <br />ideal. After a few incidents of this nature, Ramanuja abandoned the <br />life of a householder and became a Sannyasin.</p>
<p>About this time, Yamunacharya being very old was on the look-out for <br />a young person of good ability and character to take his place as <br />head of the Mutt at Srirangam. He had already heard of Ramanuja <br />through his disciples and made up his mind to instal Ramanuja in his <br />place. He now sent for Ramanuja. By the time Ramanuja reached <br />Srirangam, Yamunacharya was dead; and Ramanuja saw his body being <br />taken by his followers to the cremation ground outside the village. <br />Ramanuja followed them to the cremation ground. There he was informed <br />that Yamunacharya, before his death, had left instructions that he <br />had three wishes which Ramanuja was to be requested to fulfil, viz., <br />that a Visishtadvaita Bhashya should be written for the Brahma Sutras <br />of Vyasa which hitherto had been taught orally to the disciples of <br />the Visishtadvaita philosophy and that the names of Parasara, the <br />author of Vishnu Purana, and saint Sadagopa should be perpetuated. <br />Ramanuja was deeply touched, and in the cremation ground itself, <br />before the dead body of Yamunacharya, he made a solemn promise that, <br />God willing, he would fulfil all the three wishes of Yamunacharya. <br />Ramanuja lived for 120 years, and in the course of his long life, <br />fully redeemed his promise by fulfilling all the three wishes of <br />Yamunacharya.</p>
<p>After the death of Yamuna, his disciples at Srirangam and other <br />places wanted Ramanuja to take Yamuna's place as the head of the Mutt <br />at Srirangam. This was also the expressed wish of Yamuna. <br />Accordingly, Ramanuja took his place and was duly installed with all <br />the attendant ceremonies and celebrations as the head of the <br />Visishtadvaita Mutt at Srirangam.</p>
<p>Ramanuja then proceeded to Thirukottiyur to take initiation from <br />Nambi for Japa of the sacred Mantra of eight letters Om Namo <br />Narayanaya. Somehow, Nambi was not willing to initiate Ramanuja <br />easily. He made Ramanuja travel all the way from Srirangam to Madurai <br />nearly eighteen times before he made up his mind to initiate him, and <br />that too, only after exacting solemn promises of secrecy. Then Nambi <br />duly initiated Ramanuja and said: "Ramanuja! Keep this Mantra a <br />secret. This Mantra is a powerful one. Those who repeat this Mantra <br />will attain salvation. Give it only to a worthy disciple previously <br />tried". But Ramanuja had a very large heart. He was extremely <br />compassionate and his love for humanity was unbounded. He wanted that <br />every man should enjoy the eternal bliss of Lord Narayana. He <br />realised that the Mantra was very powerful. He immediately called all <br />people, irrespective of caste and creed, to assemble before the <br />temple. He stood on top of the tower above the front gate of the <br />temple, and shouted out the sacred Mantra to all of them at the top <br />of his voice. Nambi, his Guru, came to know of this. He became <br />furious. Ramanuja said: "O my beloved Guru! Please prescribe a <br />suitable punishment for my wrong action". Ramanuja said: "I will <br />gladly suffer the tortures of hell myself if millions of people could <br />get salvation by hearing the Mantra through me". Nambi was very much <br />pleased with Ramanuja and found out that he had a very large heart <br />full of compassion. He embraced Ramanuja and blessed him. Having thus <br />equipped himself with the necessary qualifications, Ramanuja <br />succeeded Yamuna.</p>
<p>By this time, Ramanuja's fame had spread far and wide. He became a <br />good controversialist. Then he wrote his commentary on the Brahma <br />Sutras known as the Sri Bhashya. The Visishtadvaita system is an <br />ancient one. It was expounded by Bodhayana in his Vritti, written <br />about 400 B.C. It is the same as that expounded by Ramanuja; and <br />Ramanuja followed Bodhayana in his interpretations of the Brahma <br />Sutras. Ramanuja's sect of Vaishnavas is called by the name Sri <br />Sampradaya. Ramanuja wrote also three other books--Vedanta Sara <br />(essence of Vedanta), Vedanta Sangraha (a resume of Vedanta) and <br />Vedanta Deepa (the light of Vedanta).</p>
<p>Ramanuja travelled throughout the length and breadth of India to <br />disseminate the path of devotion. He visited all the sacred places <br />throughout India including Kashi, Kashmir and Badrinath. On his way <br />back he visited the Tirupathi hills. There he found the Saivites and <br />the Vaishnavites quarrelling with one another, one party contending <br />that the image of the Lord in the Tirupathi hills was a Saivite one <br />and the other party saying that it was a Vaishnavite one. Ramanuja <br />proposed that they should leave it to the Lord Himself to decide the <br />dispute. So they left the emblems of both Siva and Vishnu at the feet <br />of the Lord, and after locking the door of the temple, both parties <br />stayed outside on guard. In the morning, when they opened the doors, <br />it was found that the image of the Lord was wearing the emblems of <br />Vishnu, while the emblems of Siva were lying at its feet as left <br />there the evening before. This decided that the temple was a <br />Vaishnavite one and it has remained so ever since.</p>
<p>Ramanuja then visited all the Vaishnavite shrines in South India and <br />finally reached Srirangam. Here he settled himself permanently and <br />continued his labours of preaching the Visishtadvaita philosophy and <br />writing books. Thousands of people flocked to him everyday to hear <br />his lectures. He cleansed the temples, settled the rituals to be <br />observed in them, and rectified many social evils which had crept <br />into the community. He had a congregation of 700 Sannyasins, 74 <br />dignitaries who held special offices of ministry, and thousands of <br />holy men and women, who revered him as God.</p>
<p>He converted lakhs of people to the path of Bhakti. He gave <br />initiation even to washermen. He was now seventy years old, but was <br />destined to live many more years, establish more Mutts, construct <br />more temples and convert many more thousands of people.</p>
<p>The Chola king about this time was Kulothunga I and he was a staunch <br />Saivite. He ordered Ramanuja to subscribe to his faith in Siva and <br />acknowledge Siva as the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Two of the disciples of Ramanuja, Kuresa and Mahapurna, donned the <br />orange robes of Sannyasins and visited the court of Kulothunga I in <br />place of Ramanuja. They argued there for the superiority of Vishnu. <br />The monarch refused to hear them and had their eyes put out.<br />The two unfortunate people started for Srirangam--their native place. <br />Mahapurna was a very old man, and unable to bear the pain, died on <br />the way. Kuresa alone returned to Srirangam.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ramanuja, with a few followers, by rapid marches through <br />day and night, reached the foot-hills of the Western Ghats, about <br />forty miles west of Mysore. There, after great difficulties, he <br />established himself and spent some years in preaching and converting <br />people to the Visishtadvaita philosophy.</p>
<p>The king of the place was Bhatti Deva of the Hoysala dynasty. The <br />Raja's daughter was possessed of some devil and nobody was able to <br />cure her. Ramanuja succeeded in exorcizing the devil and the princess <br />was restored to her former health. </p>
<p>The king was very much pleased with Ramanuja and readily became his <br />disciple and he was converted by Ramanuja into a Vaishnavite. <br />Thereafter Ramanuja firmly established himself in the Mysore king's <br />dominions, constructed a temple at Melkote, and created a strong <br />Vaishnavite community there. </p>
<p>The Pariahs or depressed classes (now called Harijans) of the place <br />were of great service to Ramanuja; and Ramanuja gave them the right <br />of entry inside the temple which he constructed at Melkote--on some <br />fixed days and with some limited privileges--which they enjoy to this <br />day.<br />Ramanuja constructed a few more Vishnu temples in and about Mysore, <br />set up a strong Vaishnavite community and put them in charge of his <br />disciples to continue his work and spread the Visishtadvaita <br />philosophy and Vishnu worship throughout the king's dominions. Thus <br />he continued his labours here for nearly twenty years and his <br />followers numbered several thousands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kulothunga Chola 1, who persecuted Ramanuja, died. The <br />followers of Ramanuja immediately communicated the news to Ramanuja <br />and requested him to come back to Srirangam. Ramanuja himself longed <br />to go back to his followers in Srirangam and worship in the temple <br />there. <br />But his new disciples and followers at Melkote and other places in <br />Mysore would not let him go. So he constructed a temple for himself, <br />installed therein his own image for worship by his disciples and <br />followers, and left the place for Srirangam. </p>
<p>He was welcomed by his friends and disciples at Srirangam. The <br />successor to Kulothunga Chola I was a pro-Vaishnavite and Ramanuja <br />was left undisturbed. Ramanuja continued his labours for thirty years <br />more and closed his long active career after attaining the remarkable <br />age of 120 years.</p>
<p>Ramanuja was the exponent of the Visishtadvaita philosophy or <br />qualified non-dualism. Ramanuja's Brahman is Sa-visesha Brahman, <br />i.e., Brahman with attributes. According to Ramanuja's teachings, <br />Lord Narayana or Bhagavan is the Supreme Being; the individual soul <br />is Chit; matter is Achit. Ramanuja regards the attributes as real and <br />permanent, but subject to the control of Brahman. </p>
<p>The attributes are called Prakaras or modes. Lord Narayana is the <br />Ruler and Lord of the universe. The Jiva is His servant and <br />worshipper. The Jiva should completely surrender himself to the Lord. <br />The oneness of God is quite consistent with the existence of <br />attributes, as the attributes or Shaktis depend upon God for their <br />existence.</p>
<p>Ramanujas ethics still followed at Puri Jagannathar temple .Kings <br />treated god as a emperor. There is a temple called alwarnath temple <br />near by Puri on Ramanuja. near by a place called tamiligudi still <br />existing in orissa as a electoral booth.</p>
<p>Detail report on ramanujas involvement with Orissa History will be <br />covered in my forthcoming articles. </p>

        <p>Hi Satish,</p>
<p>Does this sound like the failure of the leader or the yogi in not been able to communicate and get his views accepted and followed. </p>
<p>Looks like our yogis and mahans failed to imbibe their teachings.. Ramanujar treated harijans as equals, Raghavendrar did the same, many people before and after them have done the same, but did the caste system change?? </p>
<p>Or is it a collective failure that we are not able to assimilate and accept the core teachings, but are able to godify a person and believe he will do all our silly requests and prayers.</p>
<p>I guess this is still found in all religions inclusive.. </p>
<p>Regards<br />Nanda</p>

<blockquote><p>  Strangely, we dont follow the actual teachings and reformings of <br />  Ramanujar</p></blockquote>
<p>Nanda,</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Suganya, Venkatesh and myself met at Venkats house <br />and were discussing many a things. St.Thomas thread was discussed <br />and in the light of it, we all agreed on one point. Christianity <br />came it India much earlier than any other country in the world (as <br />per the belief/proof that st.Thomas visited India). Like wise Islam <br />also came to India during Prophet mohammeds lifetime itself - <br />Cheraman Perumal III. Still compared to other countries, these two <br />religions are minorities in India and cant shake even a bit of <br />Hinduism. <br />You know why - India has produced more spirutual leaders than the <br />whole world compared. Sri Chandrasekharendrar has said, the <br />greatness of Hinduism is, for every century a mahan is being born - <br />or rather avatharam..Common people are not fascinated by teachings, <br />but fascinated by the leader himself. The charisma is what keeps <br />Hinduism intact. How many of us knows the teachings of Ramana or <br />Aurobindo or the Mother...but offlate I see the mothers photo <br />atleast with one of ten people. No one know what she taught. Hope <br />this answeres your point.</p>
<p>SPS, you are always class apart. no one can match you in proving or <br />disproving things with evidence. Let it be RRC's painting or <br />Ramanujar....simply great.</p>
<blockquote><p>  ramanuja would have been treated better if he was living now. so <br />  would<br />  have been appar. they would not have been persecuted for their<br />  beleifs</p></blockquote>
<p>Venkatesh, koncham overa illa. GOod that they are not in this era. <br />Otherwise they would have been branded saffron brigade or Pro BJP <br />and would be been sidelined by the so called secularists.. :)</p>
<blockquote><p>  It is STRONGLY Believed that Sri Ramanujar is in Yoga Samadhi ... <br />not<br />  considered dead </p></blockquote>
<p>SPS, <br />Very good point. Never knew this. Remember Aurobindo's writing in <br />Synthesis of Yoga - Samadhi is the epitome of meditation when the <br />body looses its conscious. Sometimes it happens that the conscious <br />will never return to the body which is Yoga Samadhi and the body <br />will still be alive, but coma like. nothing can be done. So the <br />custom came to break the kapalam, the top portion of the head with <br />coconut so that the spirit can leave the body. For normal people the <br />spirit leaves the body through chest(?) but for yogis it will leave <br />only through the kapalam. This is called kapala motcham.</p>
<p>Ramanujar's shining skull visible - can be that the kapalam was <br />broken similarly...so that the skin is not visible but the inner <br />skull is ....just thinking aloud.</p>
<p>On the meeting front - Talked with chandra and shankaran...both are <br />attending. </p>

          Saint Ramanuja The connecting Link between orissa and Tamilnadu        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Good thread.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Strangely, we dont follow the actual teachings and reformings of <br />  Ramanujar</p></blockquote>
<p>Nanda,</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Suganya, Venkatesh and myself met at Venkats house <br />and were discussing many a things. St.Thomas thread was discussed <br />and in the light of it, we all agreed on one point. Christianity <br />came it India much earlier than any other country in the world (as <br />per the belief/proof that st.Thomas visited India). Like wise Islam <br />also came to India during Prophet mohammeds lifetime itself - <br />Cheraman Perumal III. Still compared to other countries, these two <br />religions are minorities in India and cant shake even a bit of <br />Hinduism. <br />You know why - India has produced more spirutual leaders than the <br />whole world compared. Sri Chandrasekharendrar has said, the <br />greatness of Hinduism is, for every century a mahan is being born - <br />or rather avatharam..Common people are not fascinated by teachings, <br />but fascinated by the leader himself. The charisma is what keeps <br />Hinduism intact. How many of us knows the teachings of Ramana or <br />Aurobindo or the Mother...but offlate I see the mothers photo <br />atleast with one of ten people. No one know what she taught. Hope <br />this answeres your point.</p>
<p>SPS, you are always class apart. no one can match you in proving or <br />disproving things with evidence. Let it be RRC's painting or <br />Ramanujar....simply great.</p>
<blockquote><p>  ramanuja would have been treated better if he was living now. so <br />  would<br />  have been appar. they would not have been persecuted for their<br />  beleifs</p></blockquote>
<p>Venkatesh, koncham overa illa. GOod that they are not in this era. <br />Otherwise they would have been branded saffron brigade or Pro BJP <br />and would be been sidelined by the so called secularists.. :)</p>
<blockquote><p>  It is STRONGLY Believed that Sri Ramanujar is in Yoga Samadhi ... <br />not<br />  considered dead </p></blockquote>
<p>SPS, <br />Very good point. Never knew this. Remember Aurobindo's writing in <br />Synthesis of Yoga - Samadhi is the epitome of meditation when the <br />body looses its conscious. Sometimes it happens that the conscious <br />will never return to the body which is Yoga Samadhi and the body <br />will still be alive, but coma like. nothing can be done. So the <br />custom came to break the kapalam, the top portion of the head with <br />coconut so that the spirit can leave the body. For normal people the <br />spirit leaves the body through chest(?) but for yogis it will leave <br />only through the kapalam. This is called kapala motcham.</p>
<p>Ramanujar's shining skull visible - can be that the kapalam was <br />broken similarly...so that the skin is not visible but the inner <br />skull is ....just thinking aloud.</p>
<p>On the meeting front - Talked with chandra and shankaran...both are <br />attending. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

        <p>Hi nanda</p>
<p>sure we cant follow all the teachings of somebody however great who <br />lived 7 centuries or more before us. times have chnged.</p>
<p>socially speaking I feel the equality among sects of society that <br />ramanuja visualised is better off now than before.</p>
<p>that was a time when a bigger chunk of one's time and energy was <br />devoted to religion. that percentage has come down drastically.<br />but we do have other benefits of materialism.</p>
<p>I can visit kailash or trincomalee that the thevaram trio could not.</p>
<p>ramanuja would have been treated better if he was living now. so would <br />have been appar. they would not have been persecuted for their <br />beleifs.</p>
<p>so you give some and take some. you cant blame your times for <br />everything</p>

        <p>All,</p>
<p>Strangely, we dont follow the actual teachings and reformings of Ramanujar, but only worship him as a god..looks like as a society we are giving more to tokenism than to actually follow the footsteps.. no wonder we have been under alien rule for the last 700 years.</p>
<p>Sorry for putting it blunt :(((</p>

<blockquote><p>    His body is embomed and worshipped in Srirangam temple .. Udayavar<br />    Sannidhi..<br />  is that true?I thought it was a rumour<br />  venketesh</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes it is..There is a seperate sannidhi in Sriranga where the body is <br />preserved. Not sure whether public can see it, because its kept in <br />some kind of nilavarai..once a year they take it out, redo the <br />preservings and do poojai and replace the body back in place. Thats <br />what I have heard.</p>
<p>In Hinduism, dead body, sudukadu are not auspicious. visiting such <br />place is theetu...how come this is an exception? Is there any other <br />temple where such things happen? Can anyone throw light on this?</p>

          Saint Ramanuja The connecting Link between orissa and Tamilnadu        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Some information on Sri Ramanuja</p>
<p>1. Sriperumbudur, Melkote and Srirangam are the three important places related to Ramanuja, the images of Ramanuja in the first two places were installed when Ramanuja was alive. The Sri Ramanuja image at Tirumalai is unique, here one can see Sri Ramanuja with 'gnyana mudra'(the sign of a teacher); usually, Sri Ramanuja's image always present him in the 'anjali mudra' (offering worship, both hands together in obeisance). It is said that Sri Ramanuja there is considered an Acharya to Lord Srinivasa.</p>
<p>2. Ramanuja recovered the utsava murthi of Melkote (Sampath kumar) which was taken away sometime back by Delhi sultan king. There is a story of how he recovered the idol, the sultan accepted the wish of Ramanujar to return back the idol but asked Ramanujar to chose the correct idol from a large collection of idols which were looted. Ramanuja found the correct idol by calling it by the name "Selva pillai" and the idol he was looking for moved to Ramanuja. When he was chased by the Sultan's soldiers for getting back the idol for the Sultan's daughter, Sri Ramanujar had to take refuge in a Harijan's house and then he got back to Melkote (Thiru Narayanapuram). For that reason, Harijan's are allowed to the temple. Sri Ramanuja was a great reformist, he called them as 'Thirukulathor' and he initiated many to the Sri Vaishnava fold.</p>
<p>3. Sri Ramanujar's plan to re-organise the Puri temple regulations based on Pancaratra Agamam was not accepted and he had to return back to Srirangam.</p>
<p>4. Similiarly his attempts to re-organise the Divya desams in Kerala also failed and he was resued by Namperumal. The Divya desams in Kerala are not following the Sri sampradayam of Sri Ramanujar. All the temples of Kerala are sung by Swami Nammalwar and one temple by Sri Kulasekara Alwar. Its said that the idol of Swami Nammalwar from Azhwar Thirunagari was taken to Kerala for safety during Muslim invasions.</p>
<p>5. As per the Sri Vaishnava belief, the first image of Sri Ramanujar was given to Sri Madurakavi alwar by Swami Nammalwar as the future archarya who will spread the Sri Vaishnavam, centuries before Sri Ramanujar's birth, the idol is still in the Azhwar Thirunagari(Thirukkurugoor)(birth place of Swami Nammalwar).</p>
<p>6. Sri Ramanuja's maternal uncle Tirumalai Nambi lived in Tirumala serving Lord Srinivasa. Tirumalai Nambi was a disciple of Yamunarcharya (Alavandar), he gave disclosures on Ramayanam to Sri Ramanuja at Thirupathi. Sri Ramanuja firmly asserted the temple at Tirumalai as that of Vishnu. As per Sri Ramanuja's wish his disciple Anathaalwan with his wife came to Tirumalai and prepared and maintained Nandavanam for devoting garlands to God.</p>
<p>7. Sri Ramanuja was initiated to Sri Vaishnavam by Sri Periya Nambi at the Ramar temple, Madurandagam.</p>
<p>8. Sri Ramanuja coverted more people from different faiths to Sri Vaishnavam, he even had to convert his cousin Govinda Bhatta from Saivism. Latter Govinda Bhatta was called Embar.</p>
<p>9. Sri Ramanuja gave equal importance to both tamil hymns sung by alwars and to the vedas and made tamil hymns a mandatory in all Vishnu temples.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>A point to note on Ramanujar...</p>
<p>Being a reformist, he could have tried to uproot some of the social evils at that time.. I am really not accepting the case, that just because kulothunga I was a shaivite that he went around discriminating against ramanujar.. </p>
<p>The contradiction is really showing if he was such a staunch saivite, he would not allowed Ramayanam to be written by the asthana pular.. </p>
<p>Reformists were never tolerated and hence could be the only reason why Kulothunga I could have been forced to act against Ramanujar. </p>
<p>Likewise there is another story that chettiars were prosecuted by the cholas and they vowed to act and live in kings for all generations. This is one reason, why you find huge palatial houses in chettinad areas. Again, Cholas were heavily dependent on commerce for their empire building activities and have even gone against Cadaram and sri vijaya just to protect their maritime and trading activities. This is also contradicting.. </p>
<p>Can learned people help us identify the root of this story also.</p>

        <p>Dear Bala<br />that was a very informative read...but as SPS has pointed out are there any documentary evidence that Kulothunga chased Ramanuja away<br />My understanding is Kulothunga brought him back to Srirangam....</p>
<p>Diwakar will be better person to enlighten us as this is the background of his Thirumalai Thirudan...(divya soori saritham)</p>
<p>Ramanujarai naadu kadathiyathal Choal Kirumi Kandu aval vamsathukku mutrupulli vaithikaran....(acharya vaibhava manjari)</p>
<p>Both cross referenced from Diwakars book</p>
<p>It then means <br />Adhirajendra(son of Virarajendra) deported Ramanujar and died of Laryngeal cancer his dynasty came to an end and it was the Chola Vengi Prince kulothunga who succeeds him and brings Udaiyavar back to Chola kingdom with all the mariyathai</p>
<p>Any discussions</p>
<p>Diwa please throw some light...</p>
<p>For those who havent read Thirumalai Thirudan its a must read.....a historical novel in the calibres of kalki,akilan,sandilyan etc... </p>
<p>SPS unga must read list perisayitte poguthu<br />Vengaiyin Mainthan Akilan<br />Kanchikathiravan<br />now Thirumalai Thirudan</p>

<p>Very nice to read your informations on Lord Ramanujacharya, a Very prominenet exponent, reformist of very high magnitude. Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Saint Ramanuja <br />The connecting Link between orissa and Tamilnadu <br />during 1060 to 1110.</p>
<p>Need more information on Ramanujar<br />S.Balasubramani B+</p>
<p>In the year 1017 A.D., Ramanuja was born in the village of <br />Perumbudur, about twenty-five miles west of Madras. His father was <br />Kesava Somayaji and his mother was Kantimathi, a very pious and <br />virtuous lady. Ramanuja's Tamil name was Ilaya Perumal. Quite early <br />in life, Ramanuja lost his father. Then he came to Kancheepuram to <br />prosecute his study of the Vedas under one Yadavaprakasha, a teacher <br />of Advaita philosophy.</p>
<p>Ramanuja was a very brilliant student. Yadavaprakasha's <br />interpretations of Vedic texts were not quite up to his satisfaction. <br />Ramanuja pointed out many mistakes in the exposition of his master. <br />Sometimes he gave his own interpretations which were much liked by <br />all the co-students. This made Yadavaprakasha very jealous of <br />Ramanuja.</p>
<p>Yadavaprakasha made a plan to take away the life of Ramanuja. He <br />arranged for Ramanuja and his cousin Govinda Bhatta--a fellow student-<br />-a pilgrimage to Varanasi. Govinda Bhatta, being a favourite student <br />of Yadavaprakasha, came to know of the latter's plan while they were <br />travelling. He at once apprised Ramanuja of the danger and helped him <br />to escape. By the grace of God, Ramanuja escaped with the help of a <br />hunter and his wife whom he accidentally met on the way.<br />About the end of the tenth century, the Visishtadvaita system of <br />philosophy was well established in Southern India and the followers <br />of this creed were in charge of important Vaishnavite temples at <br />Kancheepuram, Srirangam, Tirupathi and other important places. The <br />head of the important Vaishnavite institution was Yamunacharya, a <br />great sage and profound scholar; and he was also the head of the Mutt <br />at Srirangam. One of his disciples, by name Kanchipurna, was serving <br />in the temple at Kancheepuram. Although a Sudra, Kanchipurna was so <br />very pious and good that the people of the place had great respect <br />and reverence for him. At present, there is a temple at Kancheepuram <br />where Kanchipurna's image has been installed and where he is <br />worshipped as a saint.</p>
<p>Young Ramanuja came under Kanchipurna's influence and had such <br />reverence for him that he invited him to dinner in his house. <br />Ramanuja's intention was to attend on Kanchipurna and personally <br />serve him at dinner and himself take meals afterwards. Unfortunately, <br />Kanchipurna came to dinner when Ramanuja was not at home, and took <br />his meals being served by Ramanuja's wife. When Ramanuja returned <br />home, he found the house washed and his wife bathing for having <br />served meals to a Sudra. This irritated Ramanuja very much and turned <br />him against his wife who was an orthodox lady of a different social <br />ideal. After a few incidents of this nature, Ramanuja abandoned the <br />life of a householder and became a Sannyasin.</p>
<p>About this time, Yamunacharya being very old was on the look-out for <br />a young person of good ability and character to take his place as <br />head of the Mutt at Srirangam. He had already heard of Ramanuja <br />through his disciples and made up his mind to instal Ramanuja in his <br />place. He now sent for Ramanuja. By the time Ramanuja reached <br />Srirangam, Yamunacharya was dead; and Ramanuja saw his body being <br />taken by his followers to the cremation ground outside the village. <br />Ramanuja followed them to the cremation ground. There he was informed <br />that Yamunacharya, before his death, had left instructions that he <br />had three wishes which Ramanuja was to be requested to fulfil, viz., <br />that a Visishtadvaita Bhashya should be written for the Brahma Sutras <br />of Vyasa which hitherto had been taught orally to the disciples of <br />the Visishtadvaita philosophy and that the names of Parasara, the <br />author of Vishnu Purana, and saint Sadagopa should be perpetuated. <br />Ramanuja was deeply touched, and in the cremation ground itself, <br />before the dead body of Yamunacharya, he made a solemn promise that, <br />God willing, he would fulfil all the three wishes of Yamunacharya. <br />Ramanuja lived for 120 years, and in the course of his long life, <br />fully redeemed his promise by fulfilling all the three wishes of <br />Yamunacharya.</p>
<p>After the death of Yamuna, his disciples at Srirangam and other <br />places wanted Ramanuja to take Yamuna's place as the head of the Mutt <br />at Srirangam. This was also the expressed wish of Yamuna. <br />Accordingly, Ramanuja took his place and was duly installed with all <br />the attendant ceremonies and celebrations as the head of the <br />Visishtadvaita Mutt at Srirangam.</p>
<p>Ramanuja then proceeded to Thirukottiyur to take initiation from <br />Nambi for Japa of the sacred Mantra of eight letters Om Namo <br />Narayanaya. Somehow, Nambi was not willing to initiate Ramanuja <br />easily. He made Ramanuja travel all the way from Srirangam to Madurai <br />nearly eighteen times before he made up his mind to initiate him, and <br />that too, only after exacting solemn promises of secrecy. Then Nambi <br />duly initiated Ramanuja and said: "Ramanuja! Keep this Mantra a <br />secret. This Mantra is a powerful one. Those who repeat this Mantra <br />will attain salvation. Give it only to a worthy disciple previously <br />tried". But Ramanuja had a very large heart. He was extremely <br />compassionate and his love for humanity was unbounded. He wanted that <br />every man should enjoy the eternal bliss of Lord Narayana. He <br />realised that the Mantra was very powerful. He immediately called all <br />people, irrespective of caste and creed, to assemble before the <br />temple. He stood on top of the tower above the front gate of the <br />temple, and shouted out the sacred Mantra to all of them at the top <br />of his voice. Nambi, his Guru, came to know of this. He became <br />furious. Ramanuja said: "O my beloved Guru! Please prescribe a <br />suitable punishment for my wrong action". Ramanuja said: "I will <br />gladly suffer the tortures of hell myself if millions of people could <br />get salvation by hearing the Mantra through me". Nambi was very much <br />pleased with Ramanuja and found out that he had a very large heart <br />full of compassion. He embraced Ramanuja and blessed him. Having thus <br />equipped himself with the necessary qualifications, Ramanuja <br />succeeded Yamuna.</p>
<p>By this time, Ramanuja's fame had spread far and wide. He became a <br />good controversialist. Then he wrote his commentary on the Brahma <br />Sutras known as the Sri Bhashya. The Visishtadvaita system is an <br />ancient one. It was expounded by Bodhayana in his Vritti, written <br />about 400 B.C. It is the same as that expounded by Ramanuja; and <br />Ramanuja followed Bodhayana in his interpretations of the Brahma <br />Sutras. Ramanuja's sect of Vaishnavas is called by the name Sri <br />Sampradaya. Ramanuja wrote also three other books--Vedanta Sara <br />(essence of Vedanta), Vedanta Sangraha (a resume of Vedanta) and <br />Vedanta Deepa (the light of Vedanta).</p>
<p>Ramanuja travelled throughout the length and breadth of India to <br />disseminate the path of devotion. He visited all the sacred places <br />throughout India including Kashi, Kashmir and Badrinath. On his way <br />back he visited the Tirupathi hills. There he found the Saivites and <br />the Vaishnavites quarrelling with one another, one party contending <br />that the image of the Lord in the Tirupathi hills was a Saivite one <br />and the other party saying that it was a Vaishnavite one. Ramanuja <br />proposed that they should leave it to the Lord Himself to decide the <br />dispute. So they left the emblems of both Siva and Vishnu at the feet <br />of the Lord, and after locking the door of the temple, both parties <br />stayed outside on guard. In the morning, when they opened the doors, <br />it was found that the image of the Lord was wearing the emblems of <br />Vishnu, while the emblems of Siva were lying at its feet as left <br />there the evening before. This decided that the temple was a <br />Vaishnavite one and it has remained so ever since.</p>
<p>Ramanuja then visited all the Vaishnavite shrines in South India and <br />finally reached Srirangam. Here he settled himself permanently and <br />continued his labours of preaching the Visishtadvaita philosophy and <br />writing books. Thousands of people flocked to him everyday to hear <br />his lectures. He cleansed the temples, settled the rituals to be <br />observed in them, and rectified many social evils which had crept <br />into the community. He had a congregation of 700 Sannyasins, 74 <br />dignitaries who held special offices of ministry, and thousands of <br />holy men and women, who revered him as God.</p>
<p>He converted lakhs of people to the path of Bhakti. He gave <br />initiation even to washermen. He was now seventy years old, but was <br />destined to live many more years, establish more Mutts, construct <br />more temples and convert many more thousands of people.</p>
<p>The Chola king about this time was Kulothunga I and he was a staunch <br />Saivite. He ordered Ramanuja to subscribe to his faith in Siva and <br />acknowledge Siva as the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Two of the disciples of Ramanuja, Kuresa and Mahapurna, donned the <br />orange robes of Sannyasins and visited the court of Kulothunga I in <br />place of Ramanuja. They argued there for the superiority of Vishnu. <br />The monarch refused to hear them and had their eyes put out.<br />The two unfortunate people started for Srirangam--their native place. <br />Mahapurna was a very old man, and unable to bear the pain, died on <br />the way. Kuresa alone returned to Srirangam.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ramanuja, with a few followers, by rapid marches through <br />day and night, reached the foot-hills of the Western Ghats, about <br />forty miles west of Mysore. There, after great difficulties, he <br />established himself and spent some years in preaching and converting <br />people to the Visishtadvaita philosophy.</p>
<p>The king of the place was Bhatti Deva of the Hoysala dynasty. The <br />Raja's daughter was possessed of some devil and nobody was able to <br />cure her. Ramanuja succeeded in exorcizing the devil and the princess <br />was restored to her former health. </p>
<p>The king was very much pleased with Ramanuja and readily became his <br />disciple and he was converted by Ramanuja into a Vaishnavite. <br />Thereafter Ramanuja firmly established himself in the Mysore king's <br />dominions, constructed a temple at Melkote, and created a strong <br />Vaishnavite community there. </p>
<p>The Pariahs or depressed classes (now called Harijans) of the place <br />were of great service to Ramanuja; and Ramanuja gave them the right <br />of entry inside the temple which he constructed at Melkote--on some <br />fixed days and with some limited privileges--which they enjoy to this <br />day.<br />Ramanuja constructed a few more Vishnu temples in and about Mysore, <br />set up a strong Vaishnavite community and put them in charge of his <br />disciples to continue his work and spread the Visishtadvaita <br />philosophy and Vishnu worship throughout the king's dominions. Thus <br />he continued his labours here for nearly twenty years and his <br />followers numbered several thousands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kulothunga Chola 1, who persecuted Ramanuja, died. The <br />followers of Ramanuja immediately communicated the news to Ramanuja <br />and requested him to come back to Srirangam. Ramanuja himself longed <br />to go back to his followers in Srirangam and worship in the temple <br />there. <br />But his new disciples and followers at Melkote and other places in <br />Mysore would not let him go. So he constructed a temple for himself, <br />installed therein his own image for worship by his disciples and <br />followers, and left the place for Srirangam. </p>
<p>He was welcomed by his friends and disciples at Srirangam. The <br />successor to Kulothunga Chola I was a pro-Vaishnavite and Ramanuja <br />was left undisturbed. Ramanuja continued his labours for thirty years <br />more and closed his long active career after attaining the remarkable <br />age of 120 years.</p>
<p>Ramanuja was the exponent of the Visishtadvaita philosophy or <br />qualified non-dualism. Ramanuja's Brahman is Sa-visesha Brahman, <br />i.e., Brahman with attributes. According to Ramanuja's teachings, <br />Lord Narayana or Bhagavan is the Supreme Being; the individual soul <br />is Chit; matter is Achit. Ramanuja regards the attributes as real and <br />permanent, but subject to the control of Brahman. </p>
<p>The attributes are called Prakaras or modes. Lord Narayana is the <br />Ruler and Lord of the universe. The Jiva is His servant and <br />worshipper. The Jiva should completely surrender himself to the Lord. <br />The oneness of God is quite consistent with the existence of <br />attributes, as the attributes or Shaktis depend upon God for their <br />existence.</p>
<p>Ramanujas ethics still followed at Puri Jagannathar temple .Kings <br />treated god as a emperor. There is a temple called alwarnath temple <br />near by Puri on Ramanuja. near by a place called tamiligudi still <br />existing in orissa as a electoral booth.</p>
<p>Detail report on ramanujas involvement with Orissa History will be <br />covered in my forthcoming articles. </p>

          Saint Ramanuja The connecting Link between orissa and Tamilnadu        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>This is a very nice article</p>
<p>Lot of finer points are missing - few things incorrect - but overall<br />it is a nice article</p>
<p>****************************************************** </p>
<blockquote><p>  Young Ramanuja came under Kanchipurna's influence and had such <br />  reverence for him that he invited him to dinner in his house. <br />  Ramanuja's intention was to attend on Kanchipurna and personally <br />  serve him at dinner and himself take meals afterwards. Unfortunately, <br />  Kanchipurna came to dinner when Ramanuja was not at home, and took <br />  his meals being served by Ramanuja's wife. When Ramanuja returned <br />  home, he found the house washed and his wife bathing for having <br />  served meals to a Sudra. <br />****************************************************** </p></blockquote>
<p>I forgot the tamil name of this saint kanchipurna.<br />In vaishnavism there is a concept called "sesham". Sesham means left<br />over. Sesham of guru is considered sacred. Ramanuja actually intended<br />to eat the left overs of his guru and his wife could not bear this.<br />That is why she cleansed the house. This irritated ramanuja most and<br />he gave 2 more chances for her. When both chances were exhaused,<br />Ramanuja renounced family life and became a sannyasin</p>
