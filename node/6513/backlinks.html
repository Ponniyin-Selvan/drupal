</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Yesterday Myself and my brother in law and me had a discussion on - What is<br />real literature? He is a voracious reader. ardent fan of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  has read it<br />minimum 7-8 times. His voracious reading has taken him into the blog world<br />where he bumped upon such topics. In those forums they have certain thumb<br />rules I guess</acronym></p>
<p>1. Literature should not be SWARASYAM (Can I replace it with the word<br />"Interesting" / "Entertainer")<br />2. It should be YEDHARTHAM<br />3. YEDHARTHAM is always (Most of the time) painful<br />4. SWARASYAM &amp; YEDHARTHAM dont go hand in hand</p>
<p>We concluded our discussion when we started surfing the TV channels -<br />Chandramukhi was being telecast in one of the channel. he says - Manichitra<br />Thaazh is Yedartham and Chandramukhi is Swarasyam. Manichitra Thazh is<br />classic / Chandramukhi is Entertainer. In their opinion who ever writes in<br />"Vegu Jana Pathrikkai" is not an "ilakkiyavaadhi" and things that are<br />published in such magazines are not literature. So in that lines Kalki is<br />not an ilakkiyavadhi. Ponniyin Selvan is not a literature. Did we have<br />discussions in this line before?</p>

<blockquote><p>  SPS well said.</p>
<p>  Literature is an expression of a deeply felt feeling. An <br />expression of <br />  a beautiful mind. When we savor it - our mind embeds it into the <br />  dimension of another mind. That is why we all had so many <br />  interpretations of Dasavatharam movie. <br />  What more is literature that Nature cannot offer? <br />  Literature in my humble opinion, is not confined to education from <br />  others, what we observe from our mind is the greatest literature <br />one <br />  can read. </p>

<p>    Dear SPs, very well put..I would rather say Puranaanuru or Sanga <br />    Illakkiyam instead of Shakespeare or Paradise lost though just <br />for a <br />    comparison.</p>
<p>    On the same lines am reading Arvind Adiga's White Tiger, the <br />most <br />    recent Pulitzer winning novel, am only a few pages into it. The <br />    library here in US had a book discussion which I was a spectator <br />of, <br />    for this novel. </p></dmaloo@></p></blockquote>
<p>One gentleman there asked a question to me - why are <br />you Indians so keen on selling your poverty/other weaknesses to the <br />rest of the world, we in America have lots of problems too, nobody <br />writes books and wins prizes for them. Interesting point, isn't it <br />not? (Adiga's argument was that his book raises awareness, also not <br />to be dismissed).<br />=================</p>
<p>Dear Ravi,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing. Missed to see your mail earlier.</p>
<p>Dear Malathi,</p>
<p>Thanks. That is EXACTLY MY VIEW POINT ALSO .. on similar issues.</p>
<p>Why to sell poverty ! </p>
<p>In Indian movies, the coveted Golden Lotus award was bagged in the <br />past mostly by storylines on this poverty alone... !</p>
<p>Whereas our Tycoons bid for World Trade houses too !</p>
<p>I am happy with Nadhaswaram !   <br />Shenoy .... Forgive me Khan sahib !</p>

          What is real literature?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>SPS well said.</p>
<p>Literature is an expression of a deeply felt feeling. An expression of <br />a beautiful mind. When we savor it - our mind embeds it into the <br />dimension of another mind. That is why we all had so many <br />interpretations of Dasavatharam movie. <br />What more is literature that Nature cannot offer? <br />Literature in my humble opinion, is not confined to education from <br />others, what we observe from our mind is the greatest literature one <br />can read. </p>

<p>    In their hey days, Sowcar Janaki (was doing Homely Characters) and <br />    Rajashree (was doing glamour roles) were strongly expressing views <br />    on KADHAIYA (Story ? ) - SADHAIYA (Glamour ?).</p>

<p>      HI<br />      great topic</p>
<p>      right you are.<br />      first you cant define literature.</p>
<p>      literature especially fiction is broadly divided as you say. a <br />  man <br />      who wants to tell a story to the best of his ability. kalki is <br />  one.<br />      a man who expresses feelings and situations in great amount of <br />    detail <br />      and writing skill. there are so many contemprory writers.</p>
<p>      simply like your page three stories in hindu and the editorial.</p>
<p>      "life of pi" a booker winning book has some 200 pages with one <br />  man <br />      and 3 animals on the boat in mid sea. imagine the skill of the <br />    author <br />      who describes the scene without any real development in the <br />story.</p>
<p>      rushdie's books too explain a broad design visible only when you <br />      complete the book.<br />      i think most of us who are kalki lovers will come under the <br />    category <br />      of readers who want a story.<br />      venketesh</p>

<p>        Yesterday Myself and my brother in law and me had a discussion <br />    on - <br />      What is<br />        real literature? He is a voracious reader. ardent fan of PS <br />has <br />      read it<br />        minimum 7-8 times. His voracious reading has taken him into <br />the <br />      blog world<br />        where he bumped upon such topics. In those forums they have <br />    certain <br />      thumb<br />        rules I guess</p>
<p>        1. Literature should not be SWARASYAM (Can I replace it <br />with <br />    the <br />      word<br />        "Interesting" / "Entertainer")<br />        2. It should be YEDHARTHAM<br />        3. YEDHARTHAM is always (Most of the time) painful<br />        4. SWARASYAM &amp; YEDHARTHAM dont go hand in hand</p>
<p>        We concluded our discussion when we started surfing the TV <br />    channels <br />      -<br />        Chandramukhi was being telecast in one of the channel. he says <br />-</p>
<p>      Manichitra<br />        Thaazh is Yedartham and Chandramukhi is Swarasyam. Manichitra <br />    Thazh <br />      is<br />        classic / Chandramukhi is Entertainer. In their opinion who <br />  ever <br />      writes in<br />        "Vegu Jana Pathrikkai" is not an "ilakkiyavaadhi" and things <br />    that <br />      are<br />        published in such magazines are not literature. So in that <br />  lines <br />      Kalki is<br />        not an ilakkiyavadhi. Ponniyin Selvan is not a literature. Did <br />    we <br />      have<br />        discussions in this line before?</p>

        <p>I think any writing that gives enjoyment to the intellect (Budhi) <br />rather than to the 'mind' would fall within 'Literature'. Some novels <br />are not so easy to read because you have to 'think' while you are <br />reading. Most popular novels are easy to read. As with many things, <br />the distinction is relative. The more intellectual entertainment and <br />enjoyment a piece of writing gives, the more chance that it will be <br />categorized as 'literature'.</p>
<p>Similar distinction can be made between cassical music and popular <br />music, cassical dance and popular dance,subtle humour and vulgar <br />humour,etc.   </p>

<p>literature can be suppressed as it is usually done for other reasons.<br />just imagine the 1000s of book that must have been written and never <br />published in soviet russia, or today's china or north korea.<br />imagine the struggle solsenztien went thro to get his book see the <br />light of the day.<br />how many could have done it?<br />does it term them bad<br />DR ZHIVAGO<br />nobel laureate boris Pasternak wrote his autobiographical hero <br />Zhivago, derived from the Russian word for live in 1953-54<br />As the book was frowned upon by the Soviet authorities, Doctor <br />Zhivago was smuggled abroad by his friend Isaiah Berlin and published <br />in an Italian translation by the Italian publishing house Feltrinelli <br />in 1957. The novel became an instant sensation, and was subsequently <br />translated and published in many non-Soviet bloc countries. In 1958 <br />and 1959, the American edition spent 26 weeks at the top of The New <br />York Times' bestseller list. Although none of his Soviet critics had <br />the chance to read the proscribed novel, some of them publicly <br />demanded, "kick the pig out of our kitchen-garden," i.e., expel <br />Pasternak from the USSR. This led to a jocular Russian saying used to <br />poke fun at illiterate criticism, "I did not read Pasternak, but I <br />condemn him". <br />Doctor Zhivago was eventually published in the USSR in 1988.</p>
<p>on the other hand back home Godse's speech during his court <br />testifying was published after a court order 30 40 years after it was <br />delivered. forget the author, the content reflects a viewpoint doesnt <br />it?</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<p>If whatever is written, except</p>

<p>  Anything should have a goal, purpose and should address this<br />  irrespective of the time period. It can either be swarasyam (PS) or<br />  yathartham (alai oosai) but should be for a specific purpose. If i<br />  read something today and is not relevant, whats use of reading?</p>
<p>  I feel nature (or should I say time) always handle things in a<br />  balanced way. As we got only the cream of Thevaram and the rest were<br />  destroyed by nature, only the cream will survive and rest will<br />  perish. May be in a short time, it can termed injustice to the <br />author,<br />  but after 1000 years??</p>

          What is real literature?        </div>

        <p>Dear SPs, very well put..I would rather say Puranaanuru or Sanga <br />Illakkiyam instead of Shakespeare or Paradise lost though just for a <br />comparison.</p>
<p>I believe it is positive and very important to develop a likeness and <br />taste for both - the classical as well as the mundane. The problem we <br />have most people think they can only appreciate one of the two, and <br />mostly do not want to make any effort for appreciating something more <br />difficult or challenging. It is easy to read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  than it is to read <br />Sanga Illaiyam of course but we would lose glorious literature if <br />nobody like our Vairam made the effort to read it, is it not?</acronym></p>
<p>On the same lines am reading Arvind Adiga's White Tiger, the most <br />recent Pulitzer winning novel, am only a few pages into it. The <br />library here in US had a book discussion which I was a spectator of, <br />for this novel. One gentleman there asked a question to me - why are <br />you Indians so keen on selling your poverty/other weaknesses to the <br />rest of the world, we in America have lots of problems too, nobody <br />writes books and wins prizes for them. Interesting point, isn't it <br />not? (Adiga's argument was that his book raises awareness, also not <br />to be dismissed).</p>

<p>  In their hey days, Sowcar Janaki (was doing Homely Characters) and <br />  Rajashree (was doing glamour roles) were strongly expressing views <br />  on KADHAIYA (Story ? ) - SADHAIYA (Glamour ?).</p>
<p>  Rajashree criticised Janaki stating Janaki had to stick to homely <br />  roles since she could not exhibit Glamour - appreciable by most of <br />  the viewers!</p>

<p>  Whether it is Literature - or Drama / Movie - it should be <br />  appealing to the MAJORITY OF THE AUDIENCE ... ! MASS ... <br />  particularly the RURAL MASS .. </p>
<p>  This view was also supported in Director KB's Sindhu Bhaivari - <br />  while projecting on NAATTU PAADALGAL (Folk lores)....</p>
<p>  We hail Shakespere's Dramas .. or Milton's Paradise Lost etc., as <br />  classical literature..</p>
<p>  Just compare these with UNNAL MUDIYUM tamil movie... which promotes <br />  positive thoughts among the under-developed or needy youth.</p>
<p>  I will vote for Unnal Mudiym Thambi because I understand this.. it <br />  motivates me... It pertains to my brothers.. kids..</p>
<p>  That way PONNIYINSELVAN pertains to my Mother Land .. It is <br />related <br />  to my past Glory.... </p>
<p>  IALLKIYAM is derived from LAKSHYAM.... TARGET / GOAL !</p>

<p>    HI<br />    great topic</p>
<p>    right you are.<br />    first you cant define literature.</p>
<p>    literature especially fiction is broadly divided as you say. a <br />man <br />    who wants to tell a story to the best of his ability. kalki is <br />one.<br />    a man who expresses feelings and situations in great amount of <br />  detail <br />    and writing skill. there are so many contemprory writers.</p>
<p>    simply like your page three stories in hindu and the editorial.</p>
<p>    "life of pi" a booker winning book has some 200 pages with one <br />man <br />    and 3 animals on the boat in mid sea. imagine the skill of the <br />  author <br />    who describes the scene without any real development in the story.</p>
<p>    rushdie's books too explain a broad design visible only when you <br />    complete the book.<br />    i think most of us who are kalki lovers will come under the <br />  category <br />    of readers who want a story.<br />    venketesh</p>

<p>      Yesterday Myself and my brother in law and me had a discussion <br />  on - <br />    What is<br />      real literature? He is a voracious reader. ardent fan of PS has <br />    read it<br />      minimum 7-8 times. His voracious reading has taken him into the <br />    blog world<br />      where he bumped upon such topics. In those forums they have <br />  certain <br />    thumb<br />      rules I guess</p>
<p>      1. Literature should not be SWARASYAM (Can I replace it with <br />  the <br />    word<br />      "Interesting" / "Entertainer")<br />      2. It should be YEDHARTHAM<br />      3. YEDHARTHAM is always (Most of the time) painful<br />      4. SWARASYAM &amp; YEDHARTHAM dont go hand in hand</p>
<p>      We concluded our discussion when we started surfing the TV <br />  channels <br />    -<br />      Chandramukhi was being telecast in one of the channel. he says -</p>
<p>    Manichitra<br />      Thaazh is Yedartham and Chandramukhi is Swarasyam. Manichitra <br />  Thazh <br />    is<br />      classic / Chandramukhi is Entertainer. In their opinion who <br />ever <br />    writes in<br />      "Vegu Jana Pathrikkai" is not an "ilakkiyavaadhi" and things <br />  that <br />    are<br />      published in such magazines are not literature. So in that <br />lines <br />    Kalki is<br />      not an ilakkiyavadhi. Ponniyin Selvan is not a literature. Did <br />  we <br />    have<br />      discussions in this line before?</p>

<p>YATHARTHAM :: Difficult to defend.</p>
<p>Assume a guy is depicted in movie boarding Brindavan express from <br />Chennai and getting down at Bangalore and has a knap in between in 6 <br />hrs journey.</p>
<p>Central station - Brindavan express - boarding !<br />A second's knap..<br />getting down at Bangalore with the juction Name board !</p>
<p>This did figure in reviews during Jaya (Bachan) Badhuri's days.!~</p>
<p>Was written : sitting casually is Yadartham.</p>
<p>Making even SITTING as a perfect ACTION was what was expected from <br />Artiste !  </p>
<p>Counter argued : If the Character is seen it is YADARTHAM.</p>
<p>If the Actor is seen, it is Not !!</p>
<p>But then this can go on .. and defend more of the inefficients !</p>
<p>Re Literature :: who Needs Label (Certificate) ?</p>
<p>The Petromox Light bearer's NODDING was the greatest applause - <br />considered Nadhaswara Chakravarthy Rajarathnam pillai !</p>

<p>  the alertness of the herd, despite being so close, they were alert <br />to<br />  run off, it was unfortunate for the calf - maybe its lack of wordly<br />  wisdom, let its guard down - to stray too close to the front and not<br />  side the herd.</p>
<p>  the thirst of the calf to survive - its indomitable spirit to live.<br />  despite all the mauling, was in tears as it walked off finally -<br />  never expected it to survive. it had a croc and so many lions on <br />it -<br />  life's lesson learnt - it takes one shrug to loose all your troubles<br />  and be free, however great your troubles are. </p>
<p>  the resilient spirit of the herd of buffalo - though their initial<br />  response was to run, but they regrouped when they saw one of their<br />  suffering.</p>
<p>  the herd mentality - despite numerical superiority - if you watch<br />  closely its only when buffalo that repeatedly charges the lions -<br />  every herd needs a leader.</p>
<p>  the opportunism of the crocodile - you never even notice it lurks in<br />  the waters, the lions planned their attack - but the crocodile' <br />strike<br />  - was so swift and stealthy.</p>

          What is real literature?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Am I getting it wrong? Is there any thing which we call literature is<br />of bad quality? Only good quality work will surface over time. Junk<br />will be discarded in the natural process. So if a literature survives,<br />surely it will be of good quality. If whatever is written, except<br />letters and wills are literature, what do you thing - will all the<br />novels published in 'Pocket Novel','Crime Novel' etc will be treated<br />equal with <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ? both are literature as per your definition, right?<br />Which will survive the test of time? </acronym></p>
<p>Anything should have a goal, purpose and should address this<br />irrespective of the time period. It can either be swarasyam (<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ) or<br />yathartham (alai oosai) but should be for a specific purpose. If i<br />read something today and is not relevant, whats use of reading?</acronym></p>
<p>I feel nature (or should I say time) always handle things in a<br />balanced way. As we got only the cream of Thevaram and the rest were<br />destroyed by nature, only the cream will survive and rest will<br />perish. May be in a short time, it can termed injustice to the author,<br />but after 1000 years??</p>

<p>the alertness of the herd, despite being so close, they were alert to<br />run off, it was unfortunate for the calf - maybe its lack of wordly<br />wisdom, let its guard down - to stray too close to the front and not<br />side the herd.</p>
<p>the thirst of the calf to survive - its indomitable spirit to live.<br />despite all the mauling, was in tears as it walked off finally -<br />never expected it to survive. it had a croc and so many lions on it -<br />life's lesson learnt - it takes one shrug to loose all your troubles<br />and be free, however great your troubles are. </p>
<p>the resilient spirit of the herd of buffalo - though their initial<br />response was to run, but they regrouped when they saw one of their<br />suffering.</p>
<p>the herd mentality - despite numerical superiority - if you watch<br />closely its only when buffalo that repeatedly charges the lions -<br />every herd needs a leader.</p>
<p>the opportunism of the crocodile - you never even notice it lurks in<br />the waters, the lions planned their attack - but the crocodile' strike<br />- was so swift and stealthy.</p>

<p>if we talk about good and bad arent we going into the quality.<br />sometime back we had a list of novels published in tamil. ran into <br />1000's . but most are out of print and not available to the public. <br />isnt it injustice to the writer, publisher and upto the proof reader <br />for them to be left out.<br />i think literature is anything at all that people write for other <br />people to read( of course we should exclude letters and wills) <br />however i remain sympathetic to the cause of loveletters which must <br />be included in literature.<br />i wonder if people even write love letters these days???<br />venketesh</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Our sanga padalgal, tirukural, avvayar padalgal, kamba ramayanam, or<br />  the recent times Bharathiyar, bharathidasan et al...we read and<br />  re-read irrespective of the time period they were written. In that<br />  context, I think PS can be classified as a literature.</p>
<p>  swarasyam - yathartham....may be true superficially, but what moral <br />we<br />  learn from them, what is the goal....yathartham can just picturise <br />the<br />  emotions of an individual, but what it tells the reader?

<p>  Anything which talks about something in a micro level will never <br />last<br />  long. It can be a good read for a few years, but am not sure whether<br />  it will affect the people after a few generations.</p>
<p>  Somethings are even referred as classics and I remember reading<br />  somewhere a definition of classic as 'something which everyone <br />talks<br />  high about, but no one reads'. Probably yathartham falls in this<br />  category :)</p>

        <p>Dear Udanx,</p>
<p>In their hey days, Sowcar Janaki (was doing Homely Characters) and <br />Rajashree (was doing glamour roles) were strongly expressing views <br />on KADHAIYA (Story ? ) - SADHAIYA (Glamour ?).</p>
<p>Rajashree criticised Janaki stating Janaki had to stick to homely <br />roles since she could not exhibit Glamour - appreciable by most of <br />the viewers!</p>
<p>Actress Lakshmi expressed ::</p>
<p>Whether it is Literature - or Drama / Movie - it should be <br />appealing to the MAJORITY OF THE AUDIENCE ... ! MASS ... <br />particularly the RURAL MASS .. </p>
<p>This view was also supported in Director KB's Sindhu Bhaivari - <br />while projecting on NAATTU PAADALGAL (Folk lores)....</p>
<p>We hail Shakespere's Dramas .. or Milton's Paradise Lost etc., as <br />classical literature..</p>
<p>Just compare these with UNNAL MUDIYUM tamil movie... which promotes <br />positive thoughts among the under-developed or needy youth.</p>
<p>I will vote for Unnal Mudiym Thambi because I understand this.. it <br />motivates me... It pertains to my brothers.. kids..</p>
<p>That way PONNIYINSELVAN pertains to my Mother Land .. It is related <br />to my past Glory.... </p>
<p>IALLKIYAM is derived from LAKSHYAM.... TARGET / GOAL !</p>
<p>Restoring or walking towards that Glorious past is my GOAL..</p>
<p>That is my lakshyam.. that is why we are here.</p>
<p>That is my Ilakkiyam !~</p>

<blockquote><p>  HI<br />  great topic</p>
<p>  right you are.<br />  first you cant define literature.</p>
<p>  literature especially fiction is broadly divided as you say. a man <br />  who wants to tell a story to the best of his ability. kalki is one.<br />  a man who expresses feelings and situations in great amount of <br />detail <br />  and writing skill. there are so many contemprory writers.</p>
<p>  simply like your page three stories in hindu and the editorial.</p>
<p>  "life of pi" a booker winning book has some 200 pages with one man <br />  and 3 animals on the boat in mid sea. imagine the skill of the <br />author <br />  who describes the scene without any real development in the story.</p>
<p>  rushdie's books too explain a broad design visible only when you <br />  complete the book.<br />  i think most of us who are kalki lovers will come under the <br />category <br />  of readers who want a story.<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>    Yesterday Myself and my brother in law and me had a discussion <br />on - <br />  What is<br />    real literature? He is a voracious reader. ardent fan of PS has <br />  read it<br />    minimum 7-8 times. His voracious reading has taken him into the <br />  blog world<br />    where he bumped upon such topics. In those forums they have <br />certain <br />  thumb<br />    rules I guess</p>
<p>    1. Literature should not be SWARASYAM (Can I replace it with <br />the <br />  word<br />    "Interesting" / "Entertainer")<br />    2. It should be YEDHARTHAM<br />    3. YEDHARTHAM is always (Most of the time) painful<br />    4. SWARASYAM &amp; YEDHARTHAM dont go hand in hand</p>
<p>    We concluded our discussion when we started surfing the TV <br />channels <br />  -<br />    Chandramukhi was being telecast in one of the channel. he says - <br />  Manichitra<br />    Thaazh is Yedartham and Chandramukhi is Swarasyam. Manichitra <br />Thazh <br />  is<br />    classic / Chandramukhi is Entertainer. In their opinion who ever <br />  writes in<br />    "Vegu Jana Pathrikkai" is not an "ilakkiyavaadhi" and things <br />that <br />  are<br />    published in such magazines are not literature. So in that lines <br />  Kalki is<br />    not an ilakkiyavadhi. Ponniyin Selvan is not a literature. Did <br />we <br />  have<br />    discussions in this line before?</p>

        <p>Thank you Vijay, yes it is nature at its very best and amazing <br />footage.</p>
<p>Regarding the literature part, as Venkat said Kalki is enjoyed by <br />heard from my teachers - lack of contrivance/coicidences forms a big <br />part of classifying any work as great literature. Kalki liberally <br />used those and hence his work is sometimes disqualified. It is <br />difficult to agree with everything technically labelled that way <br />though - Akilan for example had very flat characters with no humor or <br />romance and yet he won Sahitya Akademi Award. </p>
<p>So it is a combination of taste plus some critical factors also.</p>

          What is real literature?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>HI<br />great topic</p>
<p>right you are.<br />first you cant define literature.</p>
<p>literature especially fiction is broadly divided as you say. a man <br />who wants to tell a story to the best of his ability. kalki is one.<br />a man who expresses feelings and situations in great amount of detail <br />and writing skill. there are so many contemprory writers.</p>
<p>simply like your page three stories in hindu and the editorial.</p>
<p>"life of pi" a booker winning book has some 200 pages with one man <br />and 3 animals on the boat in mid sea. imagine the skill of the author <br />who describes the scene without any real development in the story.</p>
<p>rushdie's books too explain a broad design visible only when you <br />complete the book.<br />i think most of us who are kalki lovers will come under the category <br />of readers who want a story.<br />venketesh</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Udanx <udanks@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Yesterday Myself and my brother in law and me had a discussion on - <br />What is<br />  real literature? He is a voracious reader. ardent fan of PS has <br />read it<br />  minimum 7-8 times. His voracious reading has taken him into the <br />blog world<br />  where he bumped upon such topics. In those forums they have certain <br />thumb<br />  rules I guess</p>
<p>  1. Literature should not be SWARASYAM (Can I replace it with the <br />word<br />  "Interesting" / "Entertainer")<br />  2. It should be YEDHARTHAM<br />  3. YEDHARTHAM is always (Most of the time) painful<br />  4. SWARASYAM &amp; YEDHARTHAM dont go hand in hand</p>
<p>  We concluded our discussion when we started surfing the TV channels <br />-<br />  Chandramukhi was being telecast in one of the channel. he says - <br />Manichitra<br />  Thaazh is Yedartham and Chandramukhi is Swarasyam. Manichitra Thazh <br />is<br />  classic / Chandramukhi is Entertainer. In their opinion who ever <br />writes in<br />  "Vegu Jana Pathrikkai" is not an "ilakkiyavaadhi" and things that <br />are<br />  published in such magazines are not literature. So in that lines <br />Kalki is<br />  not an ilakkiyavadhi. Ponniyin Selvan is not a literature. Did we <br />have<br />  discussions in this line before?</p>
