<p>Madurai is a great city and whatever it has badness<br />its minimal compared with Chennai or Coimbatore. So<br />such one sided comparison not at all necessary. </p>
<p>Regarding Pandyas they were Tamil like Cholas. When<br />you compare with achievements Cholas are best.</p>
<p>Generally Pandyas did mistake again and again inviting<br />foreigners to either for war with Cholas or solving<br />internal feuds.</p>
<p>Pandyas put Tamil miserably when invited Srilankans or<br />Malick Kafur. The brothers royal feud ruined<br />their(2000 years of Pandyas) pride.</p>
<p>So what is the point of fighting who were the best. We<br />need acceptance. Together we are Tamil and we need to<br />take the best among the best.</p>
<p>We need the best as Maharastrians boasting Sivaji.<br />They named Sathrapathi Sivaji Terminal in Mumbai.</p>
<p>We guys fighting instead of accepting the best. Tamil<br />never been united until this Pandyas-Cholas fight<br />goes.</p>

<p>    dear Kasirajan<br />    your mail makes madurai sound like an island of<br />    crime amidst an ocean <br />    of peace.<br />    what can be said of madurai can be said of any<br />  other<br />    town.<br />    its the attitude that is changing and changing<br />  alike<br />    thro out the <br />    state, the country and the world<br />    have you ever been to mylapore kapali temple. if<br />  so<br />    never take the <br />    west entrance.<br />    you should take a cholera, diptheria and a tetanus<br />    shot before <br />    venturing there barefoot.<br />    and as for urinating on the temple wall it is a<br />    fundamental right <br />    that is just not enshrined in the constitution.(<br />  and<br />    some body talked <br />    just today about deivam andre kollum) perhaps the<br />    gods are busy <br />    holding their noses from the stink and just dont<br />    have a free hand to <br />    kill.<br />    regards<br />    venketesh</p>
<p>  Apart form the attitude of the people,the<br />  administration is also to be blamed. I remember one<br />  incident during the late seventies. During<br />  the'Vaikunta Ekadesi' festival in Srirangam the<br />  temple<br />  admn used to let in the people with tickets for the<br />  'sorga vaasal' entry in the early morning,as early<br />  as<br />  9.00PM of the previous night and lock the doors.<br />  There<br />  weren't enought toilets provided for thousands of<br />  people assembled there and I have seen many of them<br />  answerering the call of the nature in some dark<br />  spots<br />  inside the temple itself. You cant blame the people<br />  alone,what else you expect them to do having locked<br />  up<br />  for 7/8 hours without adequate facilities?</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>2 years ago, I happened to stay at Sterling Resorts<br />Vilpatti, Kodaikanal.</p>
<p>Just adjacent to the resort, on the backside was a<br />vacant plot which was dumped with thousands of empty<br />mineral water bottles. The dumpage was huge. It might<br />need several lorries to clear it off the site...</p>
<p>One can bribe the forest officer at Kodaikanal and get<br />an entry to the Berijam ( or Perijam ? ) lake. The<br />stretch that takes you there is a natural beauty. But<br />the entire road is polluted by our people mainly with<br />the polythene wrappers from Lays, Cheetos kind of<br />items as well as with mineral water bottles... Some<br />could be even found on the lake itself - they claim<br />that the lake is one of the unpolluted kind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not the people that sleep on the<br />roads that caused the damage. White collar people that<br />think that they have been given the patta for the<br />whole world are the culprits. </p>
<p>Many people that urinate on public places wear decent<br />clothing. So I assume they are not the kind that sleep<br />on the road side.</p>
<p>What is the vision and values we carry to the future<br />generation ?</p>
<p>I hope members of small groups like ours can carry the<br />message and tell everyone out there that this is our<br />country and these are our people and we need to care<br />our country and people for the welfare of our progeny.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Why just put the blame on people who don't use the<br />  toilets. Haven't we <br />  thrown waste papers / plastic covers just like that<br />  on the road. Myself <br />  and a couple of my friends did take a new year<br />  resolution in 2000 not to <br />  throw waste papers / covers on the road. Don't know<br />  how many of them are <br />  following. Atleast I follow it. So let us start from<br />  us instead of <br />  pointing the finger at the low end people.</p>

<p>    As Ramakrishnan points out, the reason mainly is<br />  due to the ppl in <br />    Chennai. There are lot of slums in Chennai.

<p>    The ppl will think as 'this is our country' after<br />  their basic needs <br />    (Fud, Clothes and Shelter) are satisfied. But a<br />  lot of ppls still <br />    sleep in Road Side (like Charlie character in<br />  Anniyan), how can we <br />    expect cleanliness from them???</p>

<p>  Anyone reading "Kathavilasam" in AnandaViketan? It<br />  is<br />  an excellent commentary. A few weeks ago the author<br />  Ramakrishnan wrote something like "Why come to a<br />  city<br />  that can't even provide public toilets?"<br />  Unfortunately, even if the city provides one, people<br />  are comfortable "outside"</p>
<p>  The problem is because we tend to set our self<br />  interest first and always ask the question "what is<br />  in<br />  it for me?" </p>
<p>  Instead, if we had learnt to think 'this is our<br />  country and these are our people' we could have<br />  already become a major power.</p>

<p>    Before we get carried away with our great tamil<br />    heritage, let us also <br />    reflect on the fact that we are basically a very<br />    intolerant and intrusive <br />    society. Even Coimbatore. Yes, my folks settled<br />    there after their retirement <br />    and although I have been pleasantly struck by the<br />    respectful tamil that the <br />    people speak, the really parochial attitudes<br />    especially towards women that <br />    is present in Tamizh Nadu as a whole really<br />    irritates me. I compared <br />    Coimbatore to a place like Mysore (where my wife<br />    grew up, although she is a <br />    Tamil too) and I was completely amazed by how<br />    intellectually vibrant, <br />    liberal and all embracing a place Mysore was.<br />    Although Coimbatore is a <br />    bigger place than Mysore, there is an attitude of<br />    small mindedness about it <br />    that is decidedly rural. And having studied in<br />    Karaikudi, I can say that <br />    this is a general attitude in Tamizh Nadu<br />    (reinforced by the likes of <br />    Rajnikanth and other Kollywood idols with their<br />  male<br />    chauvinistic movies). <br />    Maybe we should try and change our attitudes first<br />    along with rejoicing over <br />    our glorious heritage :-)</p>

<p>      I do not know about Madurai but putting<br />  Coimbatore<br />    and Chennai in the<br />      same basket is a big joke. Language, which<br />    reflects the nature of a<br />      person, can be compared to understand the<br />    difference.<br />      e.g.: In Coimbatore, you will not find a single<br />    auto/taxi/bus<br />      driver/conductor to address a customer in<br />    singular. We know the polish<br />      and cultural depth of the madras baashai!!</p>
<p>      I guess it is due to the huge floating<br />  population<br />    of Chennai. I do not<br />      think it is correct to take Chennai to be a true<br />    reflection of the<br />      great Tamil culture simply because it is<br />  modified<br />    to a great extent<br />      (price for prosperity !!) . Just like Mumbai<br />    cannot be a mirror of<br />      Maharashtra.</p>
<p>      Moments when I read about the Tamil Sangham of<br />    Madurai, read PS and<br />      walked inside the Periya Kovil made me proud of<br />    the lineage I have<br />      inherited.</p>
<p>      The fact that the kings built stronger temples<br />    (which might have<br />      served as the cultural center of that village -<br />  I<br />    have seen Swiss<br />      villages built around the church) that stood the<br />    test of time/invaders<br />      but not-so-stronger forts/palaces for<br />  themselves,<br />    indicates the<br />      benevolent attitude of our kings to OUR people.</p>

<p>    Anyone reading "Kathavilasam" in AnandaViketan? It is<br />    an excellent commentary. A few weeks ago the author<br />    Ramakrishnan wrote something like "Why come to a city<br />    that can't even provide public toilets?"<br />    Unfortunately, even if the city provides one, people<br />    are comfortable "outside"</p>
<p>    The problem is because we tend to set our self<br />    interest first and always ask the question "what is in<br />    it for me?"</p>
<p>    Instead, if we had learnt to think 'this is our<br />    country and these are our people' we could have<br />    already become a major power.</p>

<p>      Before we get carried away with our great tamil<br />      heritage, let us also<br />      reflect on the fact that we are basically a very<br />      intolerant and intrusive<br />      society. Even Coimbatore. Yes, my folks settled<br />      there after their retirement<br />      and although I have been pleasantly struck by the<br />      respectful tamil that the<br />      people speak, the really parochial attitudes<br />      especially towards women that<br />      is present in Tamizh Nadu as a whole really<br />      irritates me. I compared<br />      Coimbatore to a place like Mysore (where my wife<br />      grew up, although she is a<br />      Tamil too) and I was completely amazed by how<br />      intellectually vibrant,<br />      liberal and all embracing a place Mysore was.<br />      Although Coimbatore is a<br />      bigger place than Mysore, there is an attitude of<br />      small mindedness about it<br />      that is decidedly rural. And having studied in<br />      Karaikudi, I can say that<br />      this is a general attitude in Tamizh Nadu<br />      (reinforced by the likes of<br />      Rajnikanth and other Kollywood idols with their male<br />      chauvinistic movies).<br />      Maybe we should try and change our attitudes first<br />      along with rejoicing over<br />      our glorious heritage :-)</p>

<p>        I do not know about Madurai but putting Coimbatore<br />      and Chennai in the<br />        same basket is a big joke. Language, which<br />      reflects the nature of a<br />        person, can be compared to understand the<br />      difference.<br />        e.g.: In Coimbatore, you will not find a single<br />      auto/taxi/bus<br />        driver/conductor to address a customer in<br />      singular. We know the polish<br />        and cultural depth of the madras baashai!!</p>
<p>        I guess it is due to the huge floating population<br />      of Chennai. I do not<br />        think it is correct to take Chennai to be a true<br />      reflection of the<br />        great Tamil culture simply because it is modified<br />      to a great extent<br />        (price for prosperity !!) . Just like Mumbai<br />      cannot be a mirror of<br />        Maharashtra.</p>
<p>        Moments when I read about the Tamil Sangham of<br />      Madurai, read PS and<br />        walked inside the Periya Kovil made me proud of<br />      the lineage I have<br />        inherited.</p>
<p>        The fact that the kings built stronger temples<br />      (which might have<br />        served as the cultural center of that village - I<br />      have seen Swiss<br />        villages built around the church) that stood the<br />      test of time/invaders<br />        but not-so-stronger forts/palaces for themselves,<br />      indicates the<br />        benevolent attitude of our kings to OUR people.</p>

<p>he has elaborated about a story revolving around the urinal...</p>
<p>But believe me the same ramakrishnan making good observations , has wiritten the above nooru kazhipparaigal in a manner that you would never believe it was ramakrishnan who has written it.</p>
<p>Try it </p>
<p>With Regards</p>

<p>Anyone reading "Kathavilasam" in AnandaViketan? It is<br />an excellent commentary. A few weeks ago the author<br />Ramakrishnan wrote something like "Why come to a city<br />that can't even provide public toilets?"<br />Unfortunately, even if the city provides one, people<br />are comfortable "outside"</p>
<p>The problem is because we tend to set our self<br />interest first and always ask the question "what is in<br />it for me?" </p>
<p>Instead, if we had learnt to think 'this is our<br />country and these are our people' we could have<br />already become a major power.</p>

        <p>You know something, I have never known any people as willing to urinate <br />outside or defeacate outside as us subcontinentals. I have been to Africa, <br />to some of the poorest countries there but never say anyone urinating in <br />public. I don't know the reason as to why we do it. It is because everybody <br />does it and so there is some kind of defacto acceptance of this nasty habit? <br />The other thing is of course the lack of clean public urinals. I don't know <br />how it is now, but about 10 years ago, as one entered the Trichy busstand, <br />one was assailed by this pungent urea smell coming from the local urinal. <br />The conditions inside were so bad that people were forced to urinate all <br />around the urinal leading to a surprising increase of NH3 in the air :-) <br />Maybe things have changed for the better now.. I sure hope so or else people <br />will be dropping like flies near Trichy busstand..</p>

        <p>Why just put the blame on people who don't use the toilets. Haven't we <br />thrown waste papers / plastic covers just like that on the road. Myself <br />and a couple of my friends did take a new year resolution in 2000 not to <br />throw waste papers / covers on the road. Don't know how many of them are <br />following. Atleast I follow it. So let us start from us instead of <br />pointing the finger at the low end people.</p>

<p>  As I live in Chennai, I can find lot of ppl not using the Public <br />  Toilets, because it is not maintained properly, (also, bcos of water <br />  scarcity). Of course, the ppl who r using the toilets also should use <br />  it properly. Itz the blame of both the ppl as well as govt.</p>
<p>  As Ramakrishnan points out, the reason mainly is due to the ppl in <br />  Chennai. There are lot of slums in Chennai. Govt. has to make those <br />  ppl to realise that every thing is public property. When compared to <br />  B'lore, in this regard, Chennai is very far behind.</p>
<p>  The ppl will think as 'this is our country' after their basic needs <br />  (Fud, Clothes and Shelter) are satisfied. But a lot of ppls still <br />  sleep in Road Side (like Charlie character in Anniyan), how can we <br />  expect cleanliness from them???</p>

        <p>I'd like to comment on this...</p>
<p>As I live in Chennai, I can find lot of ppl not using the Public Toilets, because it is not maintained properly, (also, bcos of water scarcity). Of course, the ppl who r using the toilets also should use it properly. Itz the blame of both the ppl as well as govt.</p>
<p>As Ramakrishnan points out, the reason mainly is due to the ppl in Chennai. There are lot of slums in Chennai. Govt. has to make those ppl to realise that every thing is public property. When compared to B'lore, in this regard, Chennai is very far behind.</p>
<p>The ppl will think as 'this is our country' after their basic needs (Fud, Clothes and Shelter) are satisfied. But a lot of ppls still sleep in Road Side (like Charlie character in Anniyan), how can we expect cleanliness from them???</p>

<p>Anyone reading "Kathavilasam" in AnandaViketan? It is<br />an excellent commentary. A few weeks ago the author<br />Ramakrishnan wrote something like "Why come to a city<br />that can't even provide public toilets?"<br />Unfortunately, even if the city provides one, people<br />are comfortable "outside"</p>
<p>The problem is because we tend to set our self<br />interest first and always ask the question "what is in<br />it for me?" </p>
<p>Instead, if we had learnt to think 'this is our<br />country and these are our people' we could have<br />already become a major power.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>This is in response to Vijay's email.</p>
<p>I do not know about Madurai but putting Coimbatore and Chennai in the<br />same basket is a big joke. Language, which reflects the nature of a<br />person, can be compared to understand the difference.<br />e.g.: In Coimbatore, you will not find a single auto/taxi/bus<br />driver/conductor to address a customer in singular. We know the polish<br />and cultural depth of the madras baashai!!</p>
<p>I guess it is due to the huge floating population of Chennai. I do not<br />think it is correct to take Chennai to be a true reflection of the<br />great Tamil culture simply because it is modified to a great extent<br />(price for prosperity !!) . Just like Mumbai cannot be a mirror of<br />Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Moments when I read about the Tamil Sangham of Madurai, read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  and<br />walked inside the Periya Kovil made me proud of the lineage I have<br />inherited.</acronym></p>
<p>The fact that the kings built stronger temples (which might have<br />served as the cultural center of that village - I have seen Swiss<br />villages built around the church) that stood the test of time/invaders<br />but not-so-stronger forts/palaces for themselves, indicates the<br />benevolent attitude of our kings to OUR people.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Regarding Madurai vs Thanjavur, Chola vs Pandyas once<br />  again the madness started.</p>
<p>  Madurai is a great city and whatever it has badness<br />  its minimal compared with Chennai or Coimbatore. So<br />  such one sided comparison not at all necessary. </p>
<p>  Regarding Pandyas they were Tamil like Cholas. When<br />  you compare with achievements Cholas are best.</p>
<p>  Generally Pandyas did mistake again and again inviting<br />  foreigners to either for war with Cholas or solving<br />  internal feuds.</p>
<p>  Pandyas put Tamil miserably when invited Srilankans or<br />  Malick Kafur. The brothers royal feud ruined<br />  their(2000 years of Pandyas) pride.</p>
<p>  So what is the point of fighting who were the best. We<br />  need acceptance. Together we are Tamil and we need to<br />  take the best among the best.</p>
<p>  We need the best as Maharastrians boasting Sivaji.<br />  They named Sathrapathi Sivaji Terminal in Mumbai.</p>
<p>  We guys fighting instead of accepting the best. Tamil<br />  never been united until this Pandyas-Cholas fight<br />  goes.</p>

<p>    Apart form the attitude of the people,the<br />    administration is also to be blamed. I remember one<br />    incident during the late seventies. During<br />    the'Vaikunta Ekadesi' festival in Srirangam the<br />    temple<br />    admn used to let in the people with tickets for the<br />    'sorga vaasal' entry in the early morning,as early<br />    as<br />    9.00PM of the previous night and lock the doors.<br />    There<br />    weren't enought toilets provided for thousands of<br />    people assembled there and I have seen many of them<br />    answerering the call of the nature in some dark<br />    spots<br />    inside the temple itself. You cant blame the people<br />    alone,what else you expect them to do having locked<br />    up<br />    for 7/8 hours without adequate facilities?</p>
