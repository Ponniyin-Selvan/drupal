<p>The lost empire explored<br />By David Keys</p>
<p>Deep in the south of India lie the spectacular remains of one of the <br />world's most remarkable and most forgotten civilsations. In its <br />heyday it was one of the half-dozen greatest powers on Earth. It <br />controlled half a million square miles - more than five times the <br />size of Britain. And under its wing literacy and the arts flourished.</p>
<p>Yet today, 1,000 years later, the Chola Empire is remembered only by <br />a handful of specialist historians. If it had been European, or had <br />given its name to some still-surviving nation, things might be <br />different. But despite 400 years of glory, the Chola Empire <br />disappeared from history; a sad fate for a civilisation which was <br />among the most remarkable produced by the medieval world.</p>
<p>In some ways, it was the most significant of the dozen or so empires <br />which rose and fell during India's long, tumultuous history. It <br />lasted some 460 years, longer than any of them. The Chola was also <br />the only Asian empire (bar the Japanese) to have indulged, albeit <br />briefly, in overseas expansion. It conquered Sri Lanka, the Andaman <br />and Nicobar islands and, temporarily, parts of south-east Asia - the <br />islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali, and the southern part of the <br />Malay peninsula.</p>
<p>Most of these overseas conquests are shrouded in mystery. All that <br />is known is that, in 1025, the Chola emperor Rajendra I dispatched <br />an army, presumably on a large fleet, across 2000 miles of ocean to <br />conquer the southern half of south-east Asia. The records show that <br />he succeeded and received the submission of large numbers of cities. <br />Some historians believe that the Cholas then simply sailed back to <br />India, but others suspect that Chola power persisted in some form in <br />south-east Asia for two or three generations.</p>
<p>Certainly, the Chola conquest contributed to a long process that had <br />already started and which linked southern India and south-east Asia <br />together in terms of trade and religion. The Indonesia/Malay region <br />was a pivotal point in trade between China and India (and, indeed, <br />the West), and both Java and Bali were largely Hindu. Rajendra's <br />conquest was perhaps the first military expression of a more general <br />connection which had been developing for centuries.</p>
<p>Closer to home, in Sri Lanka, the Cholas' overseas expansion is <br />better documented, both in text, and in stone. Tourists today can <br />still explore the great ruined city of Polonnaruva, founded by the <br />Cholas as a capital for their newly conquered island territory.</p>
<p>But the emperor's armies didn't only head southwards. In the early <br />11th century, Chola forces marched almost 1000 miles through India <br />to the banks of the Ganges. Like the south-east Asian conquest, this <br />epic ''long march'' is also shrouded in mystery. Whether the <br />emperor's objectives in marching an army<br />to the sacred river were political or purely religious is unknown. <br />Certainly, the north of India, though temporarily subdued, was not <br />incorporated into the empire - although holy Ganges water was <br />carried back to a great new capital named in honour of the sacred <br />river, and the ruler who had conquered it.</p>
<p>This capital was called Gangaikondacholapuram - literally ''the City <br />to which the Chola emperor brought the Ganges''. At the centre of <br />their new metropolis, the Cholas built a magnificent temple and a <br />vast three mile-long reservoir symbolically to hold the ''captured'' <br />waters of the Ganges. Both have survived. Under Chola rule, religion <br />and politics grew ever closer together, with the emperor projecting <br />himself as the representative, almost a manifestation, of God on <br />Earth. Large temples were built, for the first time, as royal <br />establishments. The Cholas probably built more temples than any <br />other Indian kingdom or empire. Each temple was a masterpiece. Even <br />today, the Chola heartland - along the Kaveri River in the state of <br />Tamil Nadu - is full of beautiful, delicately carved temples, some <br />the size of tiny chapels, others as big as European cathedrals. In <br />the very centre of what was the empire, there are still 40 Chola <br />temples in an area half the size of greater London. The most <br />spectacular structure is the 63m-high pyramid- shaped centralshrine <br />in the city of Thanjavur, the Chola capital before <br />Gangaikondacholapuram.</p>
<p>Chola art and architecture were among the finest in the world. <br />Indeed, in cast bronze sculpture and hard-stone sculpture, Chola art <br />is unsurpassed. Millions of figures, deftly carved in granite, can <br />still be seen on their temples, while in museums, in Thanjavur and <br />Madras, visitors can marvel at the artistry and craftsmanship of the <br />bronze figurines and statues.</p>
<p>The Cholas not only nurtured an artistic boom; they also fostered a <br />massive expansion in education. Political stability and imperial <br />grants - both to the temples which ran education and to the students <br />themselves - led to the expansion of local schools and elite <br />colleges for higher castes. The education system - which operated <br />from a religious perspective but also promoted literacy, mathematics <br />and astronomy - was probably, at least in part, responsible for the <br />development of a competent imperial administration and broadened <br />international horizons. Some estimates suggest that literacy rose to <br />around 20 per cent - perhaps the highest in the medieval world.</p>
<p>An unplanned result of this high level of education was an increase <br />in intellectual dissidence. One of the greatest Indian religious <br />thinkers - the 11th-century philosopher Ramanuja - was a product of <br />the Chola empire, although he was ultimately expelled for his views. <br />In many ways, he can be seen as the founder of Hindu monotheism with <br />his belief in a<br />unitary personal god, the ultimate font of love and compassion.</p>
<p>In the 12th century there flourished an even more dissident <br />religious movement. The Lingayats professed a sort of cynical <br />humanism which questioned the very fundamentals of religion - the <br />authority of India's holy books, the Vedas (the equivalent of the <br />Bible), and reincarnation itself. Socially, they were also radical, <br />challenging the taboo on widows re-marrying, and condemning child <br />marriages. This dissident movement derived much support from the <br />lower castes.</p>
<p>The empire also increased the importance and institutionalisation of <br />local government. Each group of five to 10 villages had an elected <br />district council, which in turn had endless sub-committees dealing <br />with everything from land rights to irrigation, law and order to <br />food storage. Every household in a district had the right to vote - <br />and the councils enjoyed considerable power. The Chola emperors <br />encouraged their development, probably as a counter-balance to the <br />power of local vassal rulers, who owed obedience to the empire.</p>
<p>Although the Cholas ruled for more than four centuries, they did so <br />with a remarkable light touch. Local responsibility for local <br />affairs was encouraged, and newly conquered local rulers were <br />allowed to keep their titles and lands, though under ultimate Chola <br />control.</p>
<p>The light touch was brought even to waging war. The Cholas <br />exemplified the Indian principle of war - the dharma yuddha, <br />literally, the principle of the fair fight. Battles were normally <br />pre- arranged and fought in daylight on a level field between equal <br />numbers of troops. Defeated princes could carry on living and <br />prospering, but had to pay homage and cough up tribute for the <br />emperor's treasury and women to act as concubines<br />and courtiers.</p>
<p>Presiding over this mixture of autocracy and democracy, a cocktail <br />of religious orthodoxy and dissidence, and a surge of artistic <br />creativity - not to mention their concubines - the Chola emperors <br />considered themselves the rulers of the world. They did, of course, <br />look on India as the Continent of the Cosmos.</p>
<p>Yet now they are forgotten, their achievements ignored by the world. <br />There is not one book in print on the Chola Empire; nor a travel-<br />company tour to most of their extraordinary temples.</p>

<p>---------------------------------<br />Interesting article..</p>
<p>The lost empire explored<br />By David Keys</p>
<p>Deep in the south of India lie the spectacular remains<br />of one of the <br />world's most remarkable and most forgotten<br />civilsations. In its <br />heyday it was one of the half-dozen greatest powers on<br />Earth. It <br />controlled half a million square miles - more than<br />five times the <br />size of Britain. And under its wing literacy and the<br />arts flourished.</p>
<p>Yet today, 1,000 years later, the Chola Empire is<br />remembered only by <br />a handful of specialist historians. If it had been<br />European, or had <br />given its name to some still-surviving nation, things<br />might be <br />different. But despite 400 years of glory, the Chola<br />Empire <br />disappeared from history; a sad fate for a<br />civilisation which was <br />among the most remarkable produced by the medieval<br />world.</p>
<p>In some ways, it was the most significant of the dozen<br />or so empires <br />which rose and fell during India's long, tumultuous<br />history. It <br />lasted some 460 years, longer than any of them. The<br />Chola was also <br />the only Asian empire (bar the Japanese) to have<br />indulged, albeit <br />briefly, in overseas expansion. It conquered Sri<br />Lanka, the Andaman <br />and Nicobar islands and, temporarily, parts of<br />south-east Asia - the <br />islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali, and the southern<br />part of the <br />Malay peninsula.</p>
<p>Most of these overseas conquests are shrouded in<br />mystery. All that <br />is known is that, in 1025, the Chola emperor Rajendra<br />I dispatched <br />an army, presumably on a large fleet, across 2000<br />miles of ocean to <br />conquer the southern half of south-east Asia. The<br />records show that <br />he succeeded and received the submission of large<br />numbers of cities. <br />Some historians believe that the Cholas then simply<br />sailed back to <br />India, but others suspect that Chola power persisted<br />in some form in <br />south-east Asia for two or three generations.</p>
<p>Certainly, the Chola conquest contributed to a long<br />process that had <br />already started and which linked southern India and<br />south-east Asia <br />together in terms of trade and religion. The<br />Indonesia/Malay region <br />was a pivotal point in trade between China and India<br />(and, indeed, <br />the West), and both Java and Bali were largely Hindu.<br />Rajendra's <br />conquest was perhaps the first military expression of<br />a more general <br />connection which had been developing for centuries.</p>
<p>Closer to home, in Sri Lanka, the Cholas' overseas<br />expansion is <br />better documented, both in text, and in stone.<br />Tourists today can <br />still explore the great ruined city of Polonnaruva,<br />founded by the <br />Cholas as a capital for their newly conquered island<br />territory.</p>
<p>But the emperor's armies didn't only head southwards.<br />In the early <br />11th century, Chola forces marched almost 1000 miles<br />through India <br />to the banks of the Ganges. Like the south-east Asian<br />conquest, this <br />epic ''long march'' is also shrouded in mystery.<br />Whether the <br />emperor's objectives in marching an army<br />to the sacred river were political or purely religious<br />is unknown. <br />Certainly, the north of India, though temporarily<br />subdued, was not <br />incorporated into the empire - although holy Ganges<br />water was <br />carried back to a great new capital named in honour of<br />the sacred <br />river, and the ruler who had conquered it.</p>
<p>This capital was called Gangaikondacholapuram -<br />literally ''the City <br />to which the Chola emperor brought the Ganges''. At<br />the centre of <br />their new metropolis, the Cholas built a magnificent<br />temple and a <br />vast three mile-long reservoir symbolically to hold<br />the ''captured'' <br />waters of the Ganges. Both have survived. Under Chola<br />rule, religion <br />and politics grew ever closer together, with the<br />emperor projecting <br />himself as the representative, almost a manifestation,<br />of God on <br />Earth. Large temples were built, for the first time,<br />as royal <br />establishments. The Cholas probably built more temples<br />than any <br />other Indian kingdom or empire. Each temple was a<br />masterpiece. Even <br />today, the Chola heartland - along the Kaveri River in<br />the state of <br />Tamil Nadu - is full of beautiful, delicately carved<br />temples, some <br />the size of tiny chapels, others as big as European<br />cathedrals. In <br />the very centre of what was the empire, there are<br />still 40 Chola <br />temples in an area half the size of greater London.<br />The most <br />spectacular structure is the 63m-high pyramid- shaped<br />centralshrine <br />in the city of Thanjavur, the Chola capital before <br />Gangaikondacholapuram.</p>
<p>Chola art and architecture were among the finest in<br />the world. <br />Indeed, in cast bronze sculpture and hard-stone<br />sculpture, Chola art <br />is unsurpassed. Millions of figures, deftly carved in<br />granite, can <br />still be seen on their temples, while in museums, in<br />Thanjavur and <br />Madras, visitors can marvel at the artistry and<br />craftsmanship of the <br />bronze figurines and statues.</p>
<p>The Cholas not only nurtured an artistic boom; they<br />also fostered a <br />massive expansion in education. Political stability<br />and imperial <br />grants - both to the temples which ran education and<br />to the students <br />themselves - led to the expansion of local schools and<br />elite <br />colleges for higher castes. The education system -<br />which operated <br />from a religious perspective but also promoted<br />literacy, mathematics <br />and astronomy - was probably, at least in part,<br />responsible for the <br />development of a competent imperial administration and<br />broadened <br />international horizons. Some estimates suggest that<br />literacy rose to <br />around 20 per cent - perhaps the highest in the<br />medieval world.</p>
<p>An unplanned result of this high level of education<br />was an increase <br />in intellectual dissidence. One of the greatest Indian<br />religious <br />thinkers - the 11th-century philosopher Ramanuja - was<br />a product of <br />the Chola empire, although he was ultimately expelled<br />for his views. <br />In many ways, he can be seen as the founder of Hindu<br />monotheism with <br />his belief in a<br />unitary personal god, the ultimate font of love and<br />compassion.</p>
<p>In the 12th century there flourished an even more<br />dissident <br />religious movement. The Lingayats professed a sort of<br />cynical <br />humanism which questioned the very fundamentals of<br />religion - the <br />authority of India's holy books, the Vedas (the<br />equivalent of the <br />Bible), and reincarnation itself. Socially, they were<br />also radical, <br />challenging the taboo on widows re-marrying, and<br />condemning child <br />marriages. This dissident movement derived much<br />support from the <br />lower castes.</p>
<p>The empire also increased the importance and<br />institutionalisation of <br />local government. Each group of five to 10 villages<br />had an elected <br />district council, which in turn had endless<br />sub-committees dealing <br />with everything from land rights to irrigation, law<br />and order to <br />food storage. Every household in a district had the<br />right to vote - <br />and the councils enjoyed considerable power. The Chola<br />emperors <br />encouraged their development, probably as a<br />counter-balance to the <br />power of local vassal rulers, who owed obedience to<br />the empire.</p>
<p>Although the Cholas ruled for more than four<br />centuries, they did so <br />with a remarkable light touch. Local responsibility<br />for local <br />affairs was encouraged, and newly conquered local<br />rulers were <br />allowed to keep their titles and lands, though under<br />ultimate Chola <br />control.</p>
<p>The light touch was brought even to waging war. The<br />Cholas <br />exemplified the Indian principle of war - the dharma<br />yuddha, <br />literally, the principle of the fair fight. Battles<br />were normally <br />pre- arranged and fought in daylight on a level field<br />between equal <br />numbers of troops. Defeated princes could carry on<br />living and <br />prospering, but had to pay homage and cough up tribute<br />for the <br />emperor's treasury and women to act as concubines<br />and courtiers.</p>
<p>Presiding over this mixture of autocracy and<br />democracy, a cocktail <br />of religious orthodoxy and dissidence, and a surge of<br />artistic <br />creativity - not to mention their concubines - the<br />Chola emperors <br />considered themselves the rulers of the world. They<br />did, of course, <br />look on India as the Continent of the Cosmos.</p>
<p>Yet now they are forgotten, their achievements ignored<br />by the world. <br />There is not one book in print on the Chola Empire; nor a travel-<br />company tour to most of their extraordinary temples.</p>
