<p>Looks Seethalakshmi madam is arriving in Chennai (from the USA) next <br />week.</p>
<p>Vizag Dhivakar is likely to be in town ..</p>
<p>Some member has been tossing the idea of having a meeting with <br />respected Dr. Iravatham Mahadevan ... </p>
<p>Today's Kumudham Reporter reported that 10 Kms from Adhichanallur <br />more finds related to stonagemen are being unearthed .. </p>
<p>Can we plan a Chennai meet on the 19th June - say 6 pm - at <br />Bharathiya Vidhya Bhavan and invite Dr. Iravatham Mahadevan ?</p>
<p>Weekends appear to be difficult.</p>
<p>pls advise.</p>
<p>regards/ sps</p>

<p>    hi sps sir,</p>
<p>    Have a doubt - myanmmar was overrun by chola forces thrice..once <br />    under Rjc 1 1024 and the second time by Virarajendra Chola -1068 <br />( <br />    army led by his nephew (sister's son) Kulothunga ) and third <br />time<br />    in 1084 Kulothunga Chola ( this time apparently led by a chola <br />    prince -who brokers peace and marries a chola princess to them!! <br />    whose identities are not known - looks like a good plot for <br />  another <br />    novel)</p>
<p>    Doubt is from below article</p>

<p>    PILLARS OF VICTORY AT PEGU.</p>
<p>    On the Pegu-Thanatpin road two octagonal granite <br />pillars, <br />    measuring about 11 and 5 feet, respectively, were found and one <br />of <br />    them has been re-erected on a masonry plinth in the compound of <br />  the <br />    district court at Pegu. They may be identified with the <br />  Jayastambha <br />    or Pillars of Victory set up by Rajendra Chola I., who overran <br />  Pegu <br />    in 1025-1027 A. D., that is to say, a few years before the <br />  conquest <br />    of Thaton by Anawrata, King of Pagan</p>
<p>    ***************************************************************</p>
<p>    reproducing from an earlier post ( the entire post of <br />  viraranjendra) <br />    down below ( full post further down)</p>
<p>    King Anuruddha chose <br />      Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />    capital <br />      of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />      importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />    capture <br />      of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>    ***************************************************************</p>
<p>    the above means pegu was capital much after RJC period. so the <br />    victory pillars cannot be assigned to rjc.</p>
<p>    from the post below ( dont know the source of the info though)</p>
<p>    Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />      victory "jayastamba" at Prome. this is from the second attack.</p>

<p>      cholas and myanmar</p>
<p>      Period of Rajaraja Chola - 1 {A.D.985 - 1014} </p>
<p>      With the beginning of the tenth century the Cholas with their <br />      capital in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, emerged as a powerful <br />ruling <br />      dynasty after a long spell in partial obscurity in the <br />political <br />      scene of South India. </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.985 king Rajaraja Chola -1 ascended the throne <br />  as <br />      the next successor to the Chola kingdom in Tamil Nadu. He <br />    gradually <br />      conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within <br />the <br />      Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. </p>
<p>      He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />      political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative system <br />      backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to <br />grow <br />      steadily into an overseas empire. </p>
<p>      During this period in Miyanmar (the former Burma) there <br />existed <br />    two <br />      main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the region <br />      called Marammadesa (the present central Miyanmar) having the <br />    capital <br />      at Arimaddanapura (the present Pagan), and the Talaing (Mon) <br />    kingdom <br />      of the region called Rammanadesa (the present southern <br />Miyanmar <br />    also <br />      known as Arumanam in Tamil) having its capital at Sudhammavati <br />    (the <br />      present Thaton). The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the <br />    medieval <br />      period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan. </p>
<p>      While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />      Kyaungbyu (A.D.984 -1006) was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />      kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king Kyizo <br />      {A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who <br />was <br />      ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period of <br />      Rajaraja - 1. </p>
<p>      During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded <br />  with <br />      Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from <br />    Rammanadesa <br />      being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" in <br />  the <br />      Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>      Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012-1044} </p>
<p>      With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola <br />  throne <br />      after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate (A.D.1012-1037) started <br />    rule <br />      in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king <br />  Kyizo, <br />      and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha <br />  (A.D.?? ? <br />      1057) ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>      During this time there had been much sea traffic between these <br />  two <br />      countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in <br />  trade <br />      with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa (also known as <br />  Arumanam) <br />      and the Mirammadesa. </p>
<p>      In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was <br />spreading <br />    it's <br />      authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present <br />    Indonesia <br />      and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at one <br />    time <br />      a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in <br />  South-<br />      East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer <br />hinderences <br />    to <br />      the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present <br />Miyanmar. </p>
<p>      Rajendra Chola ? 1 sent one of his grandson with great force <br />in <br />      A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore the <br />    title <br />      as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East <br />Asia <br />      after capturing the Manakkavaram (Great Nicobar Island), <br />reached <br />    the <br />      country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar. </p>
<p>      They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam (most possibly <br />  the <br />      present Dagon or Rangoon), and the interior capital city of <br />      Sudammavathi (Thaton) with "protected fortress walls" - of the <br />      Talaing (Mon) kingdom of Rammanadesa (Arumanam), and defeated <br />  it's <br />      ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the <br />  Rajendra <br />      Chola's forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. </p>
<p>      At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />      younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha (A.D.1037-<br />  1079) <br />    on <br />      the throne. </p>
<p>      Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by <br />his <br />      eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on <br />  Chola <br />      throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes <br />to <br />    the <br />      Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. </p>
<p>      Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} </p>
<p>      Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 was followed by his younger brother <br />  emperor <br />      Rajendra Chola ? 2 on Chola throne. </p>
<p>      Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who <br />came <br />    to <br />      the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south <br />  Miyanmar <br />      and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin <br />Arahan <br />    also <br />      informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the <br />Talaing <br />      kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and <br />  also <br />      many sacred relics. </p>
<p>      King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent his <br />    wise <br />      minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha <br />requesting <br />    some <br />      copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with much <br />  ill <br />      reply. </p>
<p>      This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with king <br />      Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which <br />  king <br />      Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family <br />to <br />      Arimaddanapura. </p>
<p>    Arimaddana <br />      empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was <br />    appointed <br />      to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />      Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />    capital <br />      of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />      importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />    capture <br />      of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>      It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, and <br />  it <br />      coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own <br />  viceroy <br />    to <br />      rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the <br />Cholas. </p>
<p>      There seems to have been no immediate response and retaliation <br />    from <br />      the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha's forces, <br />and <br />      which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. </p>
<p>      Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} </p>
<p>      Rajendra Chola ? 2 was followed by his younger brother emperor <br />      Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this time <br />  the <br />      viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed by <br />  the <br />      Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>      In this same period the king of Kadarem (present Kedah region <br />of <br />      Malaysia) with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling <br />king <br />    of <br />      Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of <br />Virarajendra <br />      Chola in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>      The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />      A.D.1068 under his nephew (sister's son) Kulothunga to help <br />the <br />    king <br />      of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead <br />  his <br />      great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />      Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />      Tharehkiltara (Prome) and captured the Rammanadesa (Arumanam). </p>
<p>      However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha <br />at <br />      Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to <br />Cholas <br />    and <br />      allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />      appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of Chola <br />      forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests <br />of <br />    the <br />      Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his <br />    victory <br />      over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />      victory "jayastamba" at Prome. </p>
<p>      Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his <br />  son <br />      Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola <br />throne. </p>
<p>      During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 (A.D.1059-1114) of <br />  Sri <br />      Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his <br />    country <br />      from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, <br />few <br />      years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />      presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />      requesting for military assistance against Cholas. </p>
<p>      But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his <br />    growing <br />      empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by <br />  providing <br />      forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents <br />to <br />    him <br />      including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. </p>
<p>      Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} </p>
<p>      Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, <br />which <br />      resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />  ascending <br />      the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. </p>
<p>      In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />      Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and <br />successfully <br />      expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a <br />  period <br />    of <br />      nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half of <br />  Sri <br />      Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />      title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor <br />the <br />      Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />      northern half of Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>      King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />      A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in the <br />      control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious <br />    elderly <br />      Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious <br />  books, <br />      and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this <br />request <br />    and <br />      sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who <br />instituted <br />  a <br />      Nikaya (Sect) known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism in <br />  Sri <br />      Lanka. </p>
<p>      Emperor Anuruddha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />      Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his <br />  rule <br />      the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />      stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. <br />  However <br />      immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and <br />    Kyanzittha <br />      also known as Tribuwanaditya) (A.D.1084-1112), who was also a <br />  son <br />    of <br />      Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from <br />Bengal - <br />      took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. </p>
<p>      At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha's forces returned <br />    back <br />      saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung and <br />  Nga <br />      Thon Pinle (thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - <br />    Traders <br />      and forces) in the present Pegu division, and captured the <br />Tamil <br />      Chola (Tamil Indian) warriors stationed in this region, who <br />were <br />    now <br />      settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur <br />    possibly <br />      under captivity. </p>
<p>      Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an <br />  army <br />      under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to <br />  avenge <br />      the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />      antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely <br />welcomed <br />      him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, and <br />    took <br />      time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />      apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. </p>
<p>      The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />      Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />      Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with <br />  the <br />      Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola <br />prince <br />    and <br />      his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. </p>
<p>      It appears during this period with the newly builtup relations <br />  the <br />      traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the <br />Chola <br />      empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />      capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and they <br />    were <br />      also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without <br />any <br />      hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />      as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". </p>
<p>      Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana <br />Kulasekara <br />      Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram (present Cranganore) of the <br />      Malaimandalam (the present Kerala state) of South India - the <br />    former <br />      capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time under <br />  the <br />      rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa (hall), gave <br />a <br />      sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly <br />in <br />    the <br />      mandapa of this temple. </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay tributes <br />  to <br />      the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung (A.D.1101-1126) of the Sung <br />  Empire. <br />      The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank and <br />      ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the <br />grand <br />      council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri <br />Vijaya. <br />      During the hsi-ning period (A.D.1068-79) imperial decrees were <br />      addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />      wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur) is a big kingdom. We cannot <br />  look <br />      down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire <br />to <br />      adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih (Arabs), <br />    Chiao-<br />      chih (Annam) etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees <br />were <br />    all <br />      written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and <br />stored <br />    in <br />      a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade <br />silk <br />      double wrapper as sealing envelope ? The emperor <br />approved....." </p>
<p>      Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />      (A.D.1112-1187) on the Arimaddanapur throne. </p>
<p>      Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} &amp; Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />      {A.D.1133-1150} </p>
<p>      It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had <br />with <br />      Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ? <br />1, <br />      during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga <br />  Chola ? <br />      2. </p>
<p>      Period of Rajaraja Chola ? 2 {A.D.1146-1163} </p>
<p>      However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the <br />distant <br />      lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the Pappalam <br />  the <br />      seaport city of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>      However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea <br />  traffic <br />      on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar <br />kingdoms <br />    even <br />      thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders <br />  being <br />      aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from <br />China, <br />    has <br />      to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the <br />  Pukan <br />      (Arimaddanapur) kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of <br />    trade <br />      activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. </p>
<p>      Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas </p>
<p>      Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of the <br />      Pandiyan empire, we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />      Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. </p>
<p>      Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ? 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be <br />the <br />      overlord of the king of Poppalam (Pappalam), and Sadaiyavarman <br />      Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received <br />tributes <br />    from <br />      Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country <br />is <br />      left out for further research study as it does not fall within <br />  the <br />      scope of the title of this essay.</p>

<p>      PILLARS OF VICTORY AT PEGU.</p>
<p>      On the Pegu-Thanatpin road two octagonal granite <br />  pillars, <br />      measuring about 11 and 5 feet, respectively, were found and one <br />  of <br />      them has been re-erected on a masonry plinth in the compound of <br />    the <br />      district court at Pegu. They may be identified with the <br />    Jayastambha <br />      or Pillars of Victory set up by Rajendra Chola I., who overran <br />    Pegu <br />      in 1025-1027 A. D., that is to say, a few years before the <br />    conquest <br />      of Thaton by Anawrata, King of Pagan</p>
<p>      ***************************************************************</p>
<p>      reproducing from an earlier post ( the entire post of <br />    viraranjendra) <br />      down below ( full post further down)</p>
<p>      King Anuruddha chose <br />        Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />      capital <br />        of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />        importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />      capture <br />        of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>      ***************************************************************</p>
<p>      the above means pegu was capital much after RJC period. so the <br />      victory pillars cannot be assigned to rjc.</p>
<p>      from the post below ( dont know the source of the info though)</p>
<p>      Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />        victory "jayastamba" at Prome. this is from the second attack.</p>

<p>        cholas and myanmar</p>
<p>        Period of Rajaraja Chola - 1 {A.D.985 - 1014} </p>
<p>        With the beginning of the tenth century the Cholas with their <br />        capital in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, emerged as a powerful <br />  ruling <br />        dynasty after a long spell in partial obscurity in the <br />  political <br />        scene of South India. </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.985 king Rajaraja Chola -1 ascended the <br />throne <br />    as <br />        the next successor to the Chola kingdom in Tamil Nadu. He <br />      gradually <br />        conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within <br />  the <br />        Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. </p>
<p>        He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />        political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative <br />system <br />        backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to <br />  grow <br />        steadily into an overseas empire. </p>
<p>        During this period in Miyanmar (the former Burma) there <br />  existed <br />      two <br />        main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the <br />region <br />        called Marammadesa (the present central Miyanmar) having the <br />      capital <br />        at Arimaddanapura (the present Pagan), and the Talaing (Mon) <br />      kingdom <br />        of the region called Rammanadesa (the present southern <br />  Miyanmar <br />      also <br />        known as Arumanam in Tamil) having its capital at <br />Sudhammavati <br />      (the <br />        present Thaton). The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the <br />      medieval <br />        period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan. </p>
<p>        While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />        Kyaungbyu (A.D.984 -1006) was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />        kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king <br />Kyizo <br />        {A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who <br />  was <br />        ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period <br />of <br />        Rajaraja - 1. </p>
<p>        During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded <br />    with <br />        Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from <br />      Rammanadesa <br />        being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" <br />in <br />    the <br />        Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>        Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012-1044} </p>
<p>        With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola <br />    throne <br />        after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate (A.D.1012-1037) <br />started <br />      rule <br />        in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king <br />    Kyizo, <br />        and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha <br />    (A.D.?? ? <br />        1057) ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>        During this time there had been much sea traffic between <br />these <br />    two <br />        countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in <br />    trade <br />        with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa (also known as <br />    Arumanam) <br />        and the Mirammadesa. </p>
<p>        In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was <br />  spreading <br />      it's <br />        authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present <br />      Indonesia <br />        and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at <br />one <br />      time <br />        a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in <br />    South-<br />        East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer <br />  hinderences <br />      to <br />        the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present <br />  Miyanmar. </p>
<p>        Rajendra Chola ? 1 sent one of his grandson with great force <br />  in <br />        A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore <br />the <br />      title <br />        as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East <br />  Asia <br />        after capturing the Manakkavaram (Great Nicobar Island), <br />  reached <br />      the <br />        country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar. </p>
<p>        They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam (most possibly <br />    the <br />        present Dagon or Rangoon), and the interior capital city of <br />        Sudammavathi (Thaton) with "protected fortress walls" - of <br />the <br />        Talaing (Mon) kingdom of Rammanadesa (Arumanam), and defeated <br />    it's <br />        ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the <br />    Rajendra <br />        Chola's forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. </p>
<p>        At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />        younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha (A.D.1037-<br />    1079) <br />      on <br />        the throne. </p>
<p>        Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by <br />  his <br />        eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on <br />    Chola <br />        throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes <br />  to <br />      the <br />        Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. </p>
<p>        Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} </p>
<p>        Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 was followed by his younger brother <br />    emperor <br />        Rajendra Chola ? 2 on Chola throne. </p>
<p>        Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who <br />  came <br />      to <br />        the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south <br />    Miyanmar <br />        and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin <br />  Arahan <br />      also <br />        informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the <br />  Talaing <br />        kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and <br />    also <br />        many sacred relics. </p>
<p>        King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent <br />his <br />      wise <br />        minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha <br />  requesting <br />      some <br />        copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with <br />much <br />    ill <br />        reply. </p>
<p>        This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with <br />king <br />        Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which <br />    king <br />        Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family <br />  to <br />        Arimaddanapura. </p>
<p>      Arimaddana <br />        empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was <br />      appointed <br />        to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />        Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />      capital <br />        of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />        importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />      capture <br />        of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>        It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, <br />and <br />    it <br />        coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own <br />    viceroy <br />      to <br />        rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the <br />  Cholas. </p>
<p>        There seems to have been no immediate response and <br />retaliation <br />      from <br />        the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha's forces, <br />  and <br />        which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. </p>
<p>        Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} </p>
<p>        Rajendra Chola ? 2 was followed by his younger brother <br />emperor <br />        Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this <br />time <br />    the <br />        viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed <br />by <br />    the <br />        Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>        In this same period the king of Kadarem (present Kedah region <br />  of <br />        Malaysia) with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling <br />  king <br />      of <br />        Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of <br />  Virarajendra <br />        Chola in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>        The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />        A.D.1068 under his nephew (sister's son) Kulothunga to help <br />  the <br />      king <br />        of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead <br />    his <br />        great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />        Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />        Tharehkiltara (Prome) and captured the Rammanadesa <br />(Arumanam). </p>
<p>        However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha <br />  at <br />        Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to <br />  Cholas <br />      and <br />        allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />        appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of <br />Chola <br />        forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests <br />  of <br />      the <br />        Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his <br />      victory <br />        over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />        victory "jayastamba" at Prome. </p>
<p>        Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his <br />    son <br />        Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola <br />  throne. </p>
<p>        During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 (A.D.1059-1114) of <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his <br />      country <br />        from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, <br />  few <br />        years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />        presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />        requesting for military assistance against Cholas. </p>
<p>        But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his <br />      growing <br />        empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by <br />    providing <br />        forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents <br />  to <br />      him <br />        including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. </p>
<p>        Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} </p>
<p>        Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, <br />  which <br />        resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />    ascending <br />        the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. </p>
<p>        In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />        Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and <br />  successfully <br />        expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a <br />    period <br />      of <br />        nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half <br />of <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />        title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor <br />  the <br />        Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />        northern half of Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>        King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />        A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in <br />the <br />        control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious <br />      elderly <br />        Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious <br />    books, <br />        and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this <br />  request <br />      and <br />        sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who <br />  instituted <br />    a <br />        Nikaya (Sect) known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism <br />in <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka. </p>
<p>        Emperor Anuruddha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />        Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his <br />    rule <br />        the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />        stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. <br />    However <br />        immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and <br />      Kyanzittha <br />        also known as Tribuwanaditya) (A.D.1084-1112), who was also a <br />    son <br />      of <br />        Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from <br />  Bengal - <br />        took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. </p>
<p>        At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha's forces <br />returned <br />      back <br />        saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung <br />and <br />    Nga <br />        Thon Pinle (thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - <br />      Traders <br />        and forces) in the present Pegu division, and captured the <br />  Tamil <br />        Chola (Tamil Indian) warriors stationed in this region, who <br />  were <br />      now <br />        settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur <br />      possibly <br />        under captivity. </p>
<p>        Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an <br />    army <br />        under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to <br />    avenge <br />        the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />        antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely <br />  welcomed <br />        him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, <br />and <br />      took <br />        time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />        apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. </p>
<p>        The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />        Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />        Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with <br />    the <br />        Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola <br />  prince <br />      and <br />        his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. </p>
<p>        It appears during this period with the newly builtup <br />relations <br />    the <br />        traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the <br />  Chola <br />        empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />        capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and <br />they <br />      were <br />        also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without <br />  any <br />        hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />        as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". </p>
<p>        Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana <br />  Kulasekara <br />        Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram (present Cranganore) of the <br />        Malaimandalam (the present Kerala state) of South India - the <br />      former <br />        capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time <br />under <br />    the <br />        rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa (hall), <br />gave <br />  a <br />        sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly <br />  in <br />      the <br />        mandapa of this temple. </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay <br />tributes <br />    to <br />        the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung (A.D.1101-1126) of the Sung <br />    Empire. <br />        The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank <br />and <br />        ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the <br />  grand <br />        council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri <br />  Vijaya. <br />        During the hsi-ning period (A.D.1068-79) imperial decrees <br />were <br />        addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />        wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur) is a big kingdom. We cannot <br />    look <br />        down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire <br />  to <br />        adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih <br />(Arabs), <br />      Chiao-<br />        chih (Annam) etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees <br />  were <br />      all <br />        written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and <br />  stored <br />      in <br />        a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade <br />  silk <br />        double wrapper as sealing envelope ? The emperor <br />  approved....." </p>
<p>        Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />        (A.D.1112-1187) on the Arimaddanapur throne. </p>
<p>        Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} &amp; Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />        {A.D.1133-1150} </p>
<p>        It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had <br />  with <br />        Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ? <br />  1, <br />        during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga <br />    Chola ? <br />        2. </p>
<p>        Period of Rajaraja Chola ? 2 {A.D.1146-1163} </p>
<p>        However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the <br />  distant <br />        lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the <br />Pappalam <br />    the <br />        seaport city of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>        However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea <br />    traffic <br />        on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar <br />  kingdoms <br />      even <br />        thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders <br />    being <br />        aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from <br />  China, <br />      has <br />        to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the <br />    Pukan <br />        (Arimaddanapur) kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of <br />      trade <br />        activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. </p>
<p>        Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas </p>
<p>        Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of <br />the <br />        Pandiyan empire, we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />        Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. </p>
<p>        Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ? 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be <br />  the <br />        overlord of the king of Poppalam (Pappalam), and <br />Sadaiyavarman <br />        Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received <br />  tributes <br />      from <br />        Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country <br />  is <br />        left out for further research study as it does not fall <br />within <br />    the <br />        scope of the title of this essay.</p></vj_episteme@></p></vj.episteme@></p></sps10142004@></p></blockquote>

<p>Hi sps</p>
<p>actually many archeologists feel finding stone age or iron age <br />settlements are not that rare.</p>
<p>especially gift siromoney used to give a list of tips to find ancient <br />settlements. he suggests look for hills next to lakes. and then look <br />around for caves or rock over hangs on the hills.<br />using a compass which responds to magnetism he said we could find <br />iron smelting sites pretty fast. the slag ( by product of melting) <br />still remains.</p>
<p>remember he found cavemen settlements next to gst road in guduvancher <br />and a host of them on hills in vandalur kelambakkam area.</p>
<p>we are finding quite a few burial urns these days. surprisngly some <br />were found inside thirukadayur temple itself.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>      PILLARS OF VICTORY AT PEGU.</p>
<p>      On the Pegu-Thanatpin road two octagonal granite <br />  pillars, <br />      measuring about 11 and 5 feet, respectively, were found and one <br />  of <br />      them has been re-erected on a masonry plinth in the compound of <br />    the <br />      district court at Pegu. They may be identified with the <br />    Jayastambha <br />      or Pillars of Victory set up by Rajendra Chola I., who overran <br />    Pegu <br />      in 1025-1027 A.

<p>      reproducing from an earlier post ( the entire post of <br />    viraranjendra) <br />      down below ( full post further down)</p>
<p>      King Anuruddha chose <br />        Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />      capital <br />        of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />        importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />      capture <br />        of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>      ***************************************************************</p>
<p>      the above means pegu was capital much after RJC period. so the <br />      victory pillars cannot be assigned to rjc.</p>
<p>      from the post below ( dont know the source of the info though)</p>
<p>      Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />        victory "jayastamba" at Prome. this is from the second attack.</p>

<p>        cholas and myanmar</p>
<p>        Period of Rajaraja Chola - 1 {A.D.985 - 1014} </p>
<p>        With the beginning of the tenth century the Cholas with their <br />        capital in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, emerged as a powerful <br />  ruling <br />        dynasty after a long spell in partial obscurity in the <br />  political <br />        scene of South India. </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.985 king Rajaraja Chola -1 ascended the <br />throne <br />    as <br />        the next successor to the Chola kingdom in Tamil Nadu. He <br />      gradually <br />        conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within <br />  the <br />        Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. </p>
<p>        He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />        political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative <br />system <br />        backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to <br />  grow <br />        steadily into an overseas empire. </p>
<p>        During this period in Miyanmar (the former Burma) there <br />  existed <br />      two <br />        main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the <br />region <br />        called Marammadesa (the present central Miyanmar) having the <br />      capital <br />        at Arimaddanapura (the present Pagan), and the Talaing (Mon) <br />      kingdom <br />        of the region called Rammanadesa (the present southern <br />  Miyanmar <br />      also <br />        known as Arumanam in Tamil) having its capital at <br />Sudhammavati <br />      (the <br />        present Thaton). The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the <br />      medieval <br />        period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan. </p>
<p>        While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />        Kyaungbyu (A.D.984 -1006) was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />        kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king <br />Kyizo <br />        {A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who <br />  was <br />        ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period <br />of <br />        Rajaraja - 1. </p>
<p>        During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded <br />    with <br />        Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from <br />      Rammanadesa <br />        being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" <br />in <br />    the <br />        Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>        Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012-1044} </p>
<p>        With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola <br />    throne <br />        after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate (A.D.1012-1037) <br />started <br />      rule <br />        in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king <br />    Kyizo, <br />        and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha <br />    (A.D.?? ? <br />        1057) ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>        During this time there had been much sea traffic between <br />these <br />    two <br />        countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in <br />    trade <br />        with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa (also known as <br />    Arumanam) <br />        and the Mirammadesa. </p>
<p>        In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was <br />  spreading <br />      it's <br />        authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present <br />      Indonesia <br />        and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at <br />one <br />      time <br />        a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in <br />    South-<br />        East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer <br />  hinderences <br />      to <br />        the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present <br />  Miyanmar. </p>
<p>        Rajendra Chola ? 1 sent one of his grandson with great force <br />  in <br />        A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore <br />the <br />      title <br />        as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East <br />  Asia <br />        after capturing the Manakkavaram (Great Nicobar Island), <br />  reached <br />      the <br />        country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar. </p>
<p>        They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam (most possibly <br />    the <br />        present Dagon or Rangoon), and the interior capital city of <br />        Sudammavathi (Thaton) with "protected fortress walls" - of <br />the <br />        Talaing (Mon) kingdom of Rammanadesa (Arumanam), and defeated <br />    it's <br />        ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the <br />    Rajendra <br />        Chola's forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. </p>
<p>        At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />        younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha (A.D.1037-<br />    1079) <br />      on <br />        the throne. </p>
<p>        Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by <br />  his <br />        eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on <br />    Chola <br />        throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes <br />  to <br />      the <br />        Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. </p>
<p>        Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} </p>
<p>        Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 was followed by his younger brother <br />    emperor <br />        Rajendra Chola ? 2 on Chola throne. </p>
<p>        Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who <br />  came <br />      to <br />        the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south <br />    Miyanmar <br />        and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin <br />  Arahan <br />      also <br />        informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the <br />  Talaing <br />        kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and <br />    also <br />        many sacred relics. </p>
<p>        King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent <br />his <br />      wise <br />        minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha <br />  requesting <br />      some <br />        copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with <br />much <br />    ill <br />        reply. </p>
<p>        This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with <br />king <br />        Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which <br />    king <br />        Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family <br />  to <br />        Arimaddanapura. </p>
<p>      Arimaddana <br />        empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was <br />      appointed <br />        to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />        Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />      capital <br />        of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />        importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />      capture <br />        of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>        It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, <br />and <br />    it <br />        coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own <br />    viceroy <br />      to <br />        rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the <br />  Cholas. </p>
<p>        There seems to have been no immediate response and <br />retaliation <br />      from <br />        the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha's forces, <br />  and <br />        which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. </p>
<p>        Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} </p>
<p>        Rajendra Chola ? 2 was followed by his younger brother <br />emperor <br />        Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this <br />time <br />    the <br />        viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed <br />by <br />    the <br />        Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>        In this same period the king of Kadarem (present Kedah region <br />  of <br />        Malaysia) with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling <br />  king <br />      of <br />        Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of <br />  Virarajendra <br />        Chola in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>        The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />        A.D.1068 under his nephew (sister's son) Kulothunga to help <br />  the <br />      king <br />        of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead <br />    his <br />        great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />        Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />        Tharehkiltara (Prome) and captured the Rammanadesa <br />(Arumanam). </p>
<p>        However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha <br />  at <br />        Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to <br />  Cholas <br />      and <br />        allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />        appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of <br />Chola <br />        forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests <br />  of <br />      the <br />        Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his <br />      victory <br />        over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />        victory "jayastamba" at Prome. </p>
<p>        Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his <br />    son <br />        Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola <br />  throne. </p>
<p>        During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 (A.D.1059-1114) of <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his <br />      country <br />        from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, <br />  few <br />        years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />        presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />        requesting for military assistance against Cholas. </p>
<p>        But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his <br />      growing <br />        empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by <br />    providing <br />        forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents <br />  to <br />      him <br />        including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. </p>
<p>        Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} </p>
<p>        Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, <br />  which <br />        resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />    ascending <br />        the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. </p>
<p>        In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />        Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and <br />  successfully <br />        expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a <br />    period <br />      of <br />        nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half <br />of <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />        title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor <br />  the <br />        Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />        northern half of Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>        King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />        A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in <br />the <br />        control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious <br />      elderly <br />        Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious <br />    books, <br />        and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this <br />  request <br />      and <br />        sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who <br />  instituted <br />    a <br />        Nikaya (Sect) known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism <br />in <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka. </p>
<p>        Emperor Anuruddha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />        Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his <br />    rule <br />        the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />        stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. <br />    However <br />        immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and <br />      Kyanzittha <br />        also known as Tribuwanaditya) (A.D.1084-1112), who was also a <br />    son <br />      of <br />        Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from <br />  Bengal - <br />        took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. </p>
<p>        At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha's forces <br />returned <br />      back <br />        saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung <br />and <br />    Nga <br />        Thon Pinle (thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - <br />      Traders <br />        and forces) in the present Pegu division, and captured the <br />  Tamil <br />        Chola (Tamil Indian) warriors stationed in this region, who <br />  were <br />      now <br />        settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur <br />      possibly <br />        under captivity. </p>
<p>        Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an <br />    army <br />        under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to <br />    avenge <br />        the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />        antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely <br />  welcomed <br />        him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, <br />and <br />      took <br />        time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />        apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. </p>
<p>        The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />        Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />        Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with <br />    the <br />        Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola <br />  prince <br />      and <br />        his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. </p>
<p>        It appears during this period with the newly builtup <br />relations <br />    the <br />        traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the <br />  Chola <br />        empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />        capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and <br />they <br />      were <br />        also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without <br />  any <br />        hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />        as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". </p>
<p>        Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana <br />  Kulasekara <br />        Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram (present Cranganore) of the <br />        Malaimandalam (the present Kerala state) of South India - the <br />      former <br />        capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time <br />under <br />    the <br />        rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa (hall), <br />gave <br />  a <br />        sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly <br />  in <br />      the <br />        mandapa of this temple. </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay <br />tributes <br />    to <br />        the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung (A.D.1101-1126) of the Sung <br />    Empire. <br />        The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank <br />and <br />        ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the <br />  grand <br />        council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri <br />  Vijaya. <br />        During the hsi-ning period (A.D.1068-79) imperial decrees <br />were <br />        addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />        wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur) is a big kingdom. We cannot <br />    look <br />        down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire <br />  to <br />        adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih <br />(Arabs), <br />      Chiao-<br />        chih (Annam) etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees <br />  were <br />      all <br />        written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and <br />  stored <br />      in <br />        a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade <br />  silk <br />        double wrapper as sealing envelope ? The emperor <br />  approved....." </p>
<p>        Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />        (A.D.1112-1187) on the Arimaddanapur throne. </p>
<p>        Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} &amp; Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />        {A.D.1133-1150} </p>
<p>        It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had <br />  with <br />        Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ? <br />  1, <br />        during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga <br />    Chola ? <br />        2. </p>
<p>        Period of Rajaraja Chola ? 2 {A.D.1146-1163} </p>
<p>        However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the <br />  distant <br />        lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the <br />Pappalam <br />    the <br />        seaport city of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>        However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea <br />    traffic <br />        on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar <br />  kingdoms <br />      even <br />        thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders <br />    being <br />        aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from <br />  China, <br />      has <br />        to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the <br />    Pukan <br />        (Arimaddanapur) kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of <br />      trade <br />        activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. </p>
<p>        Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas </p>
<p>        Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of <br />the <br />        Pandiyan empire, we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />        Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. </p>
<p>        Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ? 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be <br />  the <br />        overlord of the king of Poppalam (Pappalam), and <br />Sadaiyavarman <br />        Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received <br />  tributes <br />      from <br />        Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country <br />  is <br />        left out for further research study as it does not fall <br />within <br />    the <br />        scope of the title of this essay.</p></vj_episteme@></p></vj.episteme@></p></sps10142004@></p></blockquote>
