<p>It's been 18 years since I joined Volvo, a Swedish company. Working for them<br />has proven to be an interesting experience. Any project here takes 2 years<br />to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and brilliant. It's a rule.</p>
<p>Globalize processes have caused in us (all over the world) a general sense<br />of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we have come to posses a need<br />to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly with the slow movements of<br />the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate, debate, debate, hold x<br />quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown scheme. At the end, this<br />always yields better results.</p>
<p>Said in another words:<br />1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in Brazil.<br />2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants.<br />3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people.<br />4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are some of its renowned<br />companies. Volvo supplies the NASA.</p>
<p>The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues picked me up at the<br />hotel every morning. It was September, <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  cold and snowy. We would arrive<br />early at the company and he would park far away from the entrance (2000<br />employees drive their car to work). The first day, I didn't say anything,<br />either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do you have a fixed<br />parking space? I've noticed we park far from the entrance even when there<br />are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied, "Since we're here early<br />we'll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late will be late and need a<br />place closer to the door. Don't you think? Imagine my face.</acronym></p>
<p>Nowadays, there's a movement in Europe name Slow Food. This movement<br />establishes that people should eat and drink slowly, with enough time to<br />taste their food, spend time with the family, friends, without rushing. Slow<br />Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast Food and what it stands<br />for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a bigger movement called Slow<br />Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.</p>
<p>Basically, the movement questions the sense of "hurry" and "craziness"<br />generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of "having in quantity"<br />(life status) versus "having with quality", "life quality" or the "quality<br />of being". French people, even though they work 35 hours per week, are more<br />productive than Americans or British. Germans have established 28.8 hour<br />workweeks and have seen their productivity been driven up by 20%. This slow<br />attitude has brought forth the US's attention, pupils of the fast and the<br />"do it now!".</p>
<p>This no-rush attitude doesn't represent doing less or having a lower<br />productivity. It means working and doing things with greater quality,<br />productivity, perfection, with attention to detail and less stress. It means<br />reestablishing family values, friends, free and leisure time. Taking the<br />"now", present and concrete, versus the "global", undefined and anonymous.<br />It means taking humans' essential values, the simplicity of living.</p>
<p>It stands for a less coercive work environment, more happy, lighter and more<br />productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to do. It's time<br />to stop and think on how companies need to develop serious quality with<br />no-rush that will increase productivity and the quality of products and<br />services, without losing the essence of spirit.</p>
<p>In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there's a scene where Al Pacino asks a girl<br />to dance and she replies, "I can't, my boyfriend will be here any minute<br />now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an instant". Then they dance<br />to a tango.</p>
<p>Many of us live our lives running behind time, but we only reach it when we<br />die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing to be on time. Others are<br />so anxious of living the future that they forget to live the present, which<br />is the only time that truly exists. We all have equal time throughout the<br />world. No one has more or less. The difference lies in how each one of us<br />does with our time. We need to live each moment. As John Lennon said, *"Life<br />is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans".<br />*Congratulations for reading till the end of this message. There are many<br />who will have stopped in the middle so as not to waste time in this<br />globalized world.</p>

          [Forward]: Slowdown culture        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>so 5- 10 % of the people need to slow down by 30-40 %</p>
<p>but then there is a natural phenomenon. these guys crack up if they <br />work too much too.<br />a nature's way of slow down I gues.</p>

<p>  Vekat Sir,</p>
<p>  On seeing the percentage in your mail, the storyline of Atlas <br />Shrugged of<br />  Ayn Rand came to my mind.<br />  The story goes something like this, the hero John Galt believes <br />that the<br />  world wheel is running by a 5-10 %<br />  of people called prime movers, who are working like hell and others <br />around<br />  them are enjoying those people's<br />  hard work. he thinks if he stops those men and women from working <br />then the<br />  world will come to a stand still.</p>
<p>  Yeah, for survival whatever you have said is true, but i think <br />slowdown<br />  culture is just taking a break for those over worked guys.</p>

<p>    we have had some very great slow down cultures in history too.</p>
<p>    the hipie movement- the flower people just left the speedy cities <br />to<br />    adjust to their natural speeds. but that movement became a joke <br />when<br />    it degenerated into drugs and free sex culture.</p>

<p>        Good view Venkatesh. I got that forward more than a week back<br />    and I<br />        too feel that we need to slow up a bit. But on further <br />thoughts<br />    this<br />        fast paced life is only in the cities. Outside cities the <br />life is<br />        still slow.</p>
<p>        As you said, if govt gives 2rs rice and free TV, free Gas <br />etc. who<br />        will work. Right from colonialism till date, the rulers always<br />    wanted<br />        to keep the praja lazy and dump. yosikka arambicha vote poda<br />        matangale...</p>
<p>        But on other hand there is a serious problem of unemployment.<br />    People<br />        tell they dont get job. The problem is that we Indians think, <br />if<br />    we<br />        can read and write, we should get IT job, 6 digit salary at <br />the<br />    first<br />        month and without doing work should get promoted <br />(ayyooo....nethu<br />    than<br />        enga team appraisal mudichen athoda impact kandukatheenga...)</p>
<p>        People never think of what they are capable of and what they<br />    should<br />        get. Talking about people who complaint that they dont get job<br />        easily...I always feel 'muyarchi udayar igazhchi adayar'.</p>
<p>        A recent incident really shook me off and I felt really proud <br />for<br />    this<br />        guy whom I met. A month back, I happened to stay back in <br />office<br />    with<br />        my team late night for some urgent work (as usual in any IT<br />    company).<br />        We thuoght we can leave in next half an hour and so skipped <br />our<br />        dinner, but till 2 in the morning we couldnt retire. By 3am <br />we all<br />        felt a bit (??) hungry and thought lets check out for anything<br />    outside.<br />        (i am in Elnet, near Tidel and except for these two buildings<br />    there is<br />        not establishment near by. manushan saga <br />vendiyathuthan.concrete<br />    jail)</p>
<p>        To our surprise we could find a fellow, on his M80 fully <br />loaded<br />    with<br />        snacks, tea and all possible stuff and doing great business. <br />We<br />    got<br />        something to fill at that hour and when enquired he said he<br />    generally<br />        comes ther by 6pm and retires by 2am, but today just prolonged<br />        sometime (lucky me!!). He also said, they are totally 3 of <br />them<br />    and<br />        comes in three differnt timings. He does good business with<br />    people in<br />        Tidel and Elnet and leads his life. A new business model <br />which he<br />        could innovate. I praised him a lot in my heart and prayed <br />for his<br />        well being.</p>
<p>        I feel if someone wants to survivie decently, they can. Only <br />that<br />    we<br />        lack that instinct. Unless the attitude of blaming others for <br />our<br />        mistakes changes in Indian hearts, slow or fast, we will <br />remain<br />    the<br />        same.</p>

          [Forward]: Slowdown culture        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Okay sivaram</p>
<p>what percentage do you think needs to slow down.</p>
<p>5% 10% 15%</p>
<p>we have had some very great slow down cultures in history too.</p>
<p>the hipie movement- the flower people just left the speedy cities to <br />adjust to their natural speeds. but that movement became a joke when <br />it degenerated into drugs and free sex culture.</p>
<p>I think a natural correction is always in the offing and mankind can <br />adjust to itself.</p>
<p>one nice kutti kathai</p>
<p>in the forest the deer that runs slow is eaten up by the lion<br />in the forest the lion that is slow always goes hungry</p>
<p>it doesnt matter if you are a lion or a deer,</p>
<p>the moment you get up start running.</p>

<p>    Good view Venkatesh. I got that forward more than a week back <br />and I<br />    too feel that we need to slow up a bit. But on further thoughts <br />this<br />    fast paced life is only in the cities. Outside cities the life is<br />    still slow.</p>
<p>    As you said, if govt gives 2rs rice and free TV, free Gas etc. who<br />    will work. Right from colonialism till date, the rulers always <br />wanted<br />    to keep the praja lazy and dump. yosikka arambicha vote poda<br />    matangale...</p>
<p>    But on other hand there is a serious problem of unemployment. <br />People<br />    tell they dont get job. The problem is that we Indians think, if <br />we<br />    can read and write, we should get IT job, 6 digit salary at the <br />first<br />    month and without doing work should get promoted (ayyooo....nethu <br />than<br />    enga team appraisal mudichen athoda impact kandukatheenga...)</p>
<p>    People never think of what they are capable of and what they <br />should<br />    get. Talking about people who complaint that they dont get job<br />    easily...I always feel 'muyarchi udayar igazhchi adayar'.</p>
<p>    A recent incident really shook me off and I felt really proud for <br />this<br />    guy whom I met. A month back, I happened to stay back in office <br />with<br />    my team late night for some urgent work (as usual in any IT <br />company).<br />    We thuoght we can leave in next half an hour and so skipped our<br />    dinner, but till 2 in the morning we couldnt retire. By 3am we all<br />    felt a bit (??) hungry and thought lets check out for anything <br />outside.<br />    (i am in Elnet, near Tidel and except for these two buildings <br />there is<br />    not establishment near by. manushan saga vendiyathuthan.concrete <br />jail)</p>
<p>    To our surprise we could find a fellow, on his M80 fully loaded <br />with<br />    snacks, tea and all possible stuff and doing great business. We <br />got<br />    something to fill at that hour and when enquired he said he <br />generally<br />    comes ther by 6pm and retires by 2am, but today just prolonged<br />    sometime (lucky me!!). He also said, they are totally 3 of them <br />and<br />    comes in three differnt timings. He does good business with <br />people in<br />    Tidel and Elnet and leads his life. A new business model which he<br />    could innovate. I praised him a lot in my heart and prayed for his<br />    well being.</p>
<p>    I feel if someone wants to survivie decently, they can. Only that <br />we<br />    lack that instinct. Unless the attitude of blaming others for our<br />    mistakes changes in Indian hearts, slow or fast, we will remain <br />the<br />    same.</p>

<blockquote><p>  *An interesting reflection: *Slow Down Culture</p>
<p>  It's been 18 years since I joined Volvo, a Swedish company. Working <br />for them<br />  has proven to be an interesting experience. Any project here takes <br />2 years<br />  to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and brilliant. It's a <br />rule.</p>
<p>  Globalize processes have caused in us (all over the world) a <br />general sense<br />  of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we have come to <br />posses a need<br />  to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly with the slow <br />movements of<br />  the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate, debate, debate, hold x<br />  quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown scheme. At the end, <br />this<br />  always yields better results.</p>
<p>  Said in another words:<br />  1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in Brazil.<br />  2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants.<br />  3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people.<br />  4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are some of its <br />renowned<br />  companies. Volvo supplies the NASA.</p>
<p>  The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues picked me up <br />at the<br />  hotel every morning. It was September, bit cold and snowy. We would <br />arrive<br />  early at the company and he would park far away from the entrance <br />(2000<br />  employees drive their car to work). The first day, I didn't say <br />anything,<br />  either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do you have a <br />fixed<br />  parking space? I've noticed we park far from the entrance even when <br />there<br />  are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied, "Since we're <br />here early<br />  we'll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late will be late and <br />need a<br />  place closer to the door. Don't you think? Imagine my face.</p>
<p>  Nowadays, there's a movement in Europe name Slow Food. This movement<br />  establishes that people should eat and drink slowly, with enough <br />time to<br />  taste their food, spend time with the family, friends, without <br />rushing. Slow<br />  Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast Food and what <br />it stands<br />  for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a bigger movement <br />called Slow<br />  Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.</p>
<p>  Basically, the movement questions the sense of "hurry" and <br />"craziness"<br />  generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of "having in <br />quantity"<br />  (life status) versus "having with quality", "life quality" or the <br />"quality<br />  of being". French people, even though they work 35 hours per week, <br />are more<br />  productive than Americans or British. Germans have established 28.8 <br />hour<br />  workweeks and have seen their productivity been driven up by 20%. <br />This slow<br />  attitude has brought forth the US's attention, pupils of the fast <br />and the<br />  "do it now!".</p>
<p>  This no-rush attitude doesn't represent doing less or having a lower<br />  productivity. It means working and doing things with greater <br />quality,<br />  productivity, perfection, with attention to detail and less stress. <br />It means<br />  reestablishing family values, friends, free and leisure time. <br />Taking the<br />  "now", present and concrete, versus the "global", undefined and <br />anonymous.<br />  It means taking humans' essential values, the simplicity of living.</p>
<p>  It stands for a less coercive work environment, more happy, lighter <br />and more<br />  productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to do. <br />It's time<br />  to stop and think on how companies need to develop serious quality <br />with<br />  no-rush that will increase productivity and the quality of products <br />and<br />  services, without losing the essence of spirit.</p>
<p>  In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there's a scene where Al Pacino <br />asks a girl<br />  to dance and she replies, "I can't, my boyfriend will be here any <br />minute<br />  now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an instant". Then <br />they dance<br />  to a tango.</p>
<p>  Many of us live our lives running behind time, but we only reach it <br />when we<br />  die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing to be on time. <br />Others are<br />  so anxious of living the future that they forget to live the <br />present, which<br />  is the only time that truly exists. We all have equal time <br />throughout the<br />  world. No one has more or less. The difference lies in how each one <br />of us<br />  does with our time. We need to live each moment. As John Lennon <br />said, *"Life<br />  is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans".<br />  *Congratulations for reading till the end of this message. There <br />are many<br />  who will have stopped in the middle so as not to waste time in this<br />  globalized world.</p>

        <p>Mr.Venketesh's views are totally accurate. Ive just experienced this first<br />hand. My vendors in Coimbatore are facing severe labour shortage. They are<br />unable to find machinists, etc. Thier labourers are shunning these skilled<br />(but tough) jobs for lesser skilled jobs like painting/whitewashing<br />homes,offices,etc. The pay is more or less the same and they have to work<br />only 4 hours a day (8 hour day reduces to 4 hour because of<br />coffee/lunch/smoking breaks) when compared to the machinist's work where<br />they have to work 8-10hrs a day. The machine shop owners are taking up<br />unskilled labourers from Madurai,Namakkal and training them as machinists!<br />Every machine shop owner is of the opinion that skilled labour would be very<br />very scarce in the next 3-5 years.</p>

<p>    An interesting reflection: Slow Down Culture</p>
<p>    It's been 18 years since I joined Volvo, a Swedish company.<br />  Working for<br />    them has proven to be an interesting experience. Any project here<br />  takes 2<br />    years to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and brilliant.<br />  It's a<br />    rule.</p>
<p>    Globalize processes have caused in us (all over the world) a<br />  general sense<br />    of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we have come to<br />  posses a need<br />    to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly with the slow<br />  movements of<br />    the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate, debate, debate, hold x<br />    quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown scheme. At the end,<br />  this<br />    always yields better results.</p>
<p>    Said in another words:<br />    1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in Brazil.<br />    2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants.<br />    3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people.<br />    4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are some of its<br />  renowned<br />    companies. Volvo supplies the NASA.</p>
<p>    The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues picked me up<br />  at the<br />    hotel every morning. It was September, bit cold and snowy. We would<br />  arrive<br />    early at the company and he would park far away from the entrance<br />  (2000<br />    employees drive their car to work). The first day, I didn't say<br />  anything,<br />    either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do you have a<br />  fixed<br />    parking space? I've noticed we park far from the entrance even when<br />  there<br />    are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied, "Since we're<br />  here early<br />    we'll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late will be late and<br />  need a<br />    place closer to the door. Don't you think? Imagine my face.</p>
<p>    Nowadays, there's a movement in Europe name Slow Food. This<br />  movement<br />    establishes that people should eat and drink slowly, with enough<br />  time to<br />    taste their food, spend time with the family, friends, without<br />  rushing. Slow<br />    Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast Food and what<br />  it stands<br />    for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a bigger movement<br />  called Slow<br />    Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.</p>
<p>    Basically, the movement questions the sense of "hurry" and<br />  "craziness"<br />    generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of "having in<br />  quantity"<br />    (life status) versus "having with quality", "life quality" or the<br />  "quality<br />    of being". French people, even though they work 35 hours per week,<br />  are more<br />    productive than Americans or British. Germans have established 28.8<br />  hour<br />    workweeks and have seen their productivity been driven up by 20%.<br />  This slow<br />    attitude has brought forth the US's attention, pupils of the fast<br />  and the<br />    "do it now!".</p>
<p>    This no-rush attitude doesn't represent doing less or having a<br />  lower<br />    productivity. It means working and doing things with greater<br />  quality,<br />    productivity, perfection, with attention to detail and less stress.<br />  It means<br />    reestablishing family values, friends, free and leisure time.<br />  Taking the<br />    "now", present and concrete, versus the "global", undefined and<br />  anonymous.<br />    It means taking humans' essential values, the simplicity of living.</p>
<p>    It stands for a less coercive work environment, more happy,<br />  lighter and<br />    more productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to<br />  do. It's<br />    time to stop and think on how companies need to develop serious<br />  quality with<br />    no-rush that will increase productivity and the quality of products<br />  and<br />    services, without losing the essence of spirit.</p>
<p>    In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there's a scene where Al Pacino<br />  asks a<br />    girl to dance and she replies, "I can't, my boyfriend will be here<br />  any<br />    minute now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an instant".<br />  Then<br />    they dance to a tango.</p>
<p>    Many of us live our lives running behind time, but we only reach<br />  it when<br />    we die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing to be on<br />  time. Others<br />    are so anxious of living the future that they forget to live the<br />  present,<br />    which is the only time that truly exists. We all have equal time<br />  throughout<br />    the world. No one has more or less. The difference lies in how each<br />  one of<br />    us does with our time. We need to live each moment. As John Lennon<br />  said,<br />    "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans".<br />    Congratulations for reading till the end of this message. There<br />  are many<br />    who will have stopped in the middle so as not to waste time in this<br />    globalized world.</p></bmurga@...></ponniyinselvan%40yahoogroups.com></p></blockquote>

        <p>Good view Venkatesh. I got that forward more than a week back and I <br />too feel that we need to slow up a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym . But on further thoughts this <br />fast paced life is only in the cities. Outside cities the life is <br />still slow. </acronym></p>
<p>As you said, if govt gives 2rs rice and free TV, free Gas etc. who <br />will work. Right from colonialism till date, the rulers always wanted <br />to keep the praja lazy and dump. yosikka arambicha vote poda <br />matangale...</p>
<p>But on other hand there is a serious problem of unemployment. People <br />tell they dont get job. The problem is that we Indians think, if we <br />can read and write, we should get IT job, 6 digit salary at the first <br />month and without doing work should get promoted (ayyooo....nethu than <br />enga team appraisal mudichen athoda impact kandukatheenga...)</p>
<p>People never think of what they are capable of and what they should <br />get. Talking about people who complaint that they dont get job <br />easily...I always feel 'muyarchi udayar igazhchi adayar'.</p>
<p>A recent incident really shook me off and I felt really proud for this <br />guy whom I met. A month back, I happened to stay back in office with <br />my team late night for some urgent work (as usual in any IT company). <br />We thuoght we can leave in next half an hour and so skipped our <br />dinner, but till 2 in the morning we couldnt retire. By 3am we all <br />felt a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  (??) hungry and thought lets check out for anything outside.<br />(i am in Elnet, near Tidel and except for these two buildings there is <br />not establishment near by. manushan saga vendiyathuthan.concrete jail)</acronym></p>
<p>To our surprise we could find a fellow, on his M80 fully loaded with <br />snacks, tea and all possible stuff and doing great business. We got <br />something to fill at that hour and when enquired he said he generally <br />comes ther by 6pm and retires by 2am, but today just prolonged <br />sometime (lucky me!!). He also said, they are totally 3 of them and <br />comes in three differnt timings. He does good business with people in <br />Tidel and Elnet and leads his life. A new business model which he <br />could innovate. I praised him a lot in my heart and prayed for his <br />well being. </p>
<p>I feel if someone wants to survivie decently, they can. Only that we <br />lack that instinct. Unless the attitude of blaming others for our <br />mistakes changes in Indian hearts, slow or fast, we will remain the <br />same.</p>

        <p>An interesting reflection: Slow Down Culture </p>
<p>Very good article Mr.Sivakumar.<br />Slow means 'NITHAANAM'<br />NITHAANAME PRADHAANAM.<br />anbudan<br />Dhivakar.<br />P.S. Even Yahoo <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  also follow this Slow down culture for the past 10/15 days it seems. I am getting <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Mails very very slow. Writer Devan mentions in one of his famous Book (Ms.Janaki) that 'if it is urgent, send Telegram - If it so urgent send one post card too'. Now I can say that if it is not so urgent 'you can mail through <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym -yahoo group.:)<br />Dhivakar.</acronym></p>

<p>It's been 18 years since I joined Volvo, a Swedish company. Working for them has proven to be an interesting experience. Any project here takes 2 years to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and brilliant. It's a rule. </p>
<p>Globalize processes have caused in us (all over the world) a general sense of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we have come to posses a need to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly with the slow movements of the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate, debate, debate, hold x quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown scheme. At the end, this always yields better results. </p>
<p>Said in another words: <br />1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in Brazil. <br />2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants. <br />3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people. <br />4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are some of its renowned companies. Volvo supplies the NASA. </p>
<p>The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues picked me up at the hotel every morning. It was September, <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  cold and snowy. We would arrive early at the company and he would park far away from the entrance (2000 employees drive their car to work). The first day, I didn't say anything, either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do you have a fixed parking space? I've noticed we park far from the entrance even when there are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied, "Since we're here early we'll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late will be late and need a place closer to the door. Don't you think? Imagine my face. </p>
<p>Nowadays, there's a movement in Europe name Slow Food. This movement establishes that people should eat and drink slowly, with enough time to taste their food, spend time with the family, friends, without rushing. Slow Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast Food and what it stands for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a bigger movement called Slow Europe, as mentioned by Business Week. </p>
<p>Basically, the movement questions the sense of "hurry" and "craziness" generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of "having in quantity" (life status) versus "having with quality", "life quality" or the "quality of being". French people, even though they work 35 hours per week, are more productive than Americans or British. Germans have established 28.8 hour workweeks and have seen their productivity been driven up by 20%. This slow attitude has brought forth the US's attention, pupils of the fast and the "do it now!". </p>
<p>This no-rush attitude doesn't represent doing less or having a lower productivity. It means working and doing things with greater quality, productivity, perfection, with attention to detail and less stress. It means reestablishing family values, friends, free and leisure time. Taking the "now", present and concrete, versus the "global", undefined and anonymous. It means taking humans' essential values, the simplicity of living. </p>
<p>It stands for a less coercive work environment, more happy, lighter and more productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to do. It's time to stop and think on how companies need to develop serious quality with no-rush that will increase productivity and the quality of products and services, without losing the essence of spirit. </p>
<p>In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there's a scene where Al Pacino asks a girl to dance and she replies, "I can't, my boyfriend will be here any minute now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an instant". Then they dance to a tango. </p>
<p>Many of us live our lives running behind time, but we only reach it when we die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing to be on time. Others are so anxious of living the future that they forget to live the present, which is the only time that truly exists. We all have equal time throughout the world. No one has more or less. The difference lies in how each one of us does with our time. We need to live each moment. As John Lennon said, "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans". <br />Congratulations for reading till the end of this message. There are many who will have stopped in the middle so as not to waste time in this globalized world. </p>

<p>It stands for a less coercive work environment, more happy, lighter and<br />more productive where humans enjoy doing what they know best how to do.

        <p>Dear Natarajan, Points well projected.</p>
<p>Dear Sivakumar, nice reply again.</p>
<p>Primarily my focus of attention was on the slow - fast aspects and <br />relative merits etc. There I agree with the famous quote of John <br />Lennon. But when the focus is shifted to Globalisation - the <br />plantain leaf example well tossed by our dear friend Natarajan <br />obviously stares at us.</p>
<p>Further dimensions related to India's (Venkat will ask where was it <br />before the British?) past Glory will be more spicy too.</p>
<p>Then as Sivakumar replied it need not be in all the spheres ..</p>
<p>Very interesting views generated.. </p>
<p>thank you both..</p>
<p>best regards / sps</p>

<p>    Slow down culture is a well written article<br />    describing a good way of living. While appreciating<br />    your sincere motive behind writing this article I wish<br />    to record my quick provocations after reading this<br />    article.</p>
<p>    Please note my comments are pertaining to the<br />    attempts to criticize globalization.</p>
<p>    India is a well deserved country to be in the top of<br />    the world. One thing heavily pulling down India is her<br />    economic status. Globalization really trying to pull<br />    us out of this misery. Unless some real, urgent and<br />    rapid efforts are made the economic gap with the rest<br />    of the world will remain big if not growing bigger.</p>
<p>    Our excellent intellectual and hidden wealths are now<br />    being cleaned out of rust and we are coming out of the<br />    thick dark economic ignorance. Globalization scrapes<br />    out these unwanted coverings at least at some sectors.</p>
<p>    A harsh comparison comes to my mind. Your article<br />    reminds me a healthy man sitting in front of a full<br />    plantain leaf served with a hundred dishes along with<br />    a dozen appetizers and a dozen deserts. A little away<br />    I am sitting in front of a stitched leaf served with<br />    curd rice and lemon pickles. The first man really has<br />    his own choice of eating at his own pace.</p>
<p>    Before deciding the pace at which we have to<br />    eat we must sit in the same row of full plantain<br />    leaves. I hope globalization makes us to inch towards<br />    this place.</p>

<p>      *An interesting reflection: *Slow Down Culture</p>
<p>      It's been 18 years since I joined Volvo, a Swedish<br />      company. Working for them<br />      has proven to be an interesting experience. Any<br />      project here takes 2 years<br />      to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and<br />      brilliant. It's a rule.</p>
<p>      Globalize processes have caused in us (all over the<br />      world) a general sense<br />      of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we<br />      have come to posses a need<br />      to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly<br />      with the slow movements of<br />      the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate,<br />      debate, debate, hold x<br />      quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown<br />      scheme. At the end, this<br />      always yields better results.</p>
<p>      Said in another words:<br />      1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in<br />      Brazil.<br />      2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants.<br />      3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people.<br />      4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are<br />      some of its renowned<br />      companies. Volvo supplies the NASA.</p>
<p>      The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues<br />      picked me up at the<br />      hotel every morning. It was September, bit cold and<br />      snowy. We would arrive<br />      early at the company and he would park far away from<br />      the entrance (2000<br />      employees drive their car to work). The first day, I<br />      didn't say anything,<br />      either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do<br />      you have a fixed<br />      parking space? I've noticed we park far from the<br />      entrance even when there<br />      are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied,<br />      "Since we're here early<br />      we'll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late<br />      will be late and need a<br />      place closer to the door. Don't you think? Imagine<br />      my face.</p>
<p>      Nowadays, there's a movement in Europe name Slow<br />      Food. This movement<br />      establishes that people should eat and drink slowly,<br />      with enough time to<br />      taste their food, spend time with the family,<br />      friends, without rushing. Slow<br />      Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast<br />      Food and what it stands<br />      for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a<br />      bigger movement called Slow<br />      Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.</p>
<p>      Basically, the movement questions the sense of<br />      "hurry" and "craziness"<br />      generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of<br />      "having in quantity"<br />      (life status) versus "having with quality", "life<br />      quality" or the "quality<br />      of being". French people, even though they work 35<br />      hours per week, are more<br />      productive than Americans or British. Germans have<br />      established 28.8 hour<br />      workweeks and have seen their productivity been<br />      driven up by 20%. This slow<br />      attitude has brought forth the US's attention,<br />      pupils of the fast and the<br />      "do it now!".</p>
<p>      This no-rush attitude doesn't represent doing less<br />      or having a lower<br />      productivity. It means working and doing things with<br />      greater quality,<br />      productivity, perfection, with attention to detail<br />      and less stress. It means<br />      reestablishing family values, friends, free and<br />      leisure time. Taking the<br />      "now", present and concrete, versus the "global",<br />      undefined and anonymous.<br />      It means taking humans' essential values, the<br />      simplicity of living.</p>
<p>      It stands for a less coercive work environment, more<br />      happy, lighter and more<br />      productive where humans enjoy doing what they know<br />      best how to do. It's time<br />      to stop and think on how companies need to develop<br />      serious quality with<br />      no-rush that will increase productivity and the<br />      quality of products and<br />      services, without losing the essence of spirit.</p>

          [Forward]: Slowdown culture        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sivakumar,</p>
<p>Slow down culture is a well written article<br />describing a good way of living. While appreciating<br />your sincere motive behind writing this article I wish<br />to record my quick provocations after reading this<br />article.</p>
<p>Please note my comments are pertaining to the<br />attempts to criticize globalization.</p>
<p>India is a well deserved country to be in the top of<br />the world. One thing heavily pulling down India is her<br />economic status. Globalization really trying to pull<br />us out of this misery. Unless some real, urgent and<br />rapid efforts are made the economic gap with the rest<br />of the world will remain big if not growing bigger.</p>
<p>Our excellent intellectual and hidden wealths are now<br />being cleaned out of rust and we are coming out of the<br />thick dark economic ignorance. Globalization scrapes<br />out these unwanted coverings at least at some sectors.</p>
<p>A harsh comparison comes to my mind. Your article<br />reminds me a healthy man sitting in front of a full<br />plantain leaf served with a hundred dishes along with<br />a dozen appetizers and a dozen deserts. A little away<br />I am sitting in front of a stitched leaf served with<br />curd rice and lemon pickles. The first man really has<br />his own choice of eating at his own pace.</p>
<p>Before deciding the pace at which we have to<br />eat we must sit in the same row of full plantain<br />leaves. I hope globalization makes us to inch towards<br />this place.</p>
<p>Natarajan.</p>

<blockquote><p>  *An interesting reflection: *Slow Down Culture</p>
<p>  It's been 18 years since I joined Volvo, a Swedish<br />  company. Working for them<br />  has proven to be an interesting experience. Any<br />  project here takes 2 years<br />  to be finalized, even if the idea is simple and<br />  brilliant. It's a rule.</p>
<p>  Globalize processes have caused in us (all over the<br />  world) a general sense<br />  of searching for immediate results. Therefore, we<br />  have come to posses a need<br />  to see immediate results. This contrasts greatly<br />  with the slow movements of<br />  the Swedish. They, on the other hand, debate,<br />  debate, debate, hold x<br />  quantity of meetings and work with a slowdown<br />  scheme. At the end, this<br />  always yields better results.</p>
<p>  Said in another words:<br />  1. Sweden is about the size of San Pablo, a state in<br />  Brazil.<br />  2. Sweden has 2 million inhabitants.<br />  3. Stockholm, has 500,000 people.<br />  4. Volvo, Escania, Ericsson, Electrolux, Nokia are<br />  some of its renowned<br />  companies. Volvo supplies the NASA.</p>
<p>  The first time I was in Sweden, one of my colleagues<br />  picked me up at the<br />  hotel every morning. It was September, bit cold and<br />  snowy. We would arrive<br />  early at the company and he would park far away from<br />  the entrance (2000<br />  employees drive their car to work). The first day, I<br />  didn't say anything,<br />  either the second or third. One morning I asked, "Do<br />  you have a fixed<br />  parking space? I've noticed we park far from the<br />  entrance even when there<br />  are no other cars in the lot." To which he replied,<br />  "Since we're here early<br />  we'll have time to walk, and whoever gets in late<br />  will be late and need a<br />  place closer to the door. Don't you think? Imagine<br />  my face.</p>
<p>  Nowadays, there's a movement in Europe name Slow<br />  Food. This movement<br />  establishes that people should eat and drink slowly,<br />  with enough time to<br />  taste their food, spend time with the family,<br />  friends, without rushing. Slow<br />  Food is against its counterpart: the spirit of Fast<br />  Food and what it stands<br />  for as a lifestyle. Slow Food is the basis for a<br />  bigger movement called Slow<br />  Europe, as mentioned by Business Week.</p>
<p>  Basically, the movement questions the sense of<br />  "hurry" and "craziness"<br />  generated by globalization, fueled by the desire of<br />  "having in quantity"<br />  (life status) versus "having with quality", "life<br />  quality" or the "quality<br />  of being". French people, even though they work 35<br />  hours per week, are more<br />  productive than Americans or British. Germans have<br />  established 28.8 hour<br />  workweeks and have seen their productivity been<br />  driven up by 20%. This slow<br />  attitude has brought forth the US's attention,<br />  pupils of the fast and the<br />  "do it now!".</p>
<p>  This no-rush attitude doesn't represent doing less<br />  or having a lower<br />  productivity. It means working and doing things with<br />  greater quality,<br />  productivity, perfection, with attention to detail<br />  and less stress. It means<br />  reestablishing family values, friends, free and<br />  leisure time. Taking the<br />  "now", present and concrete, versus the "global",<br />  undefined and anonymous.<br />  It means taking humans' essential values, the<br />  simplicity of living.</p>
<p>  It stands for a less coercive work environment, more<br />  happy, lighter and more<br />  productive where humans enjoy doing what they know<br />  best how to do. It's time<br />  to stop and think on how companies need to develop<br />  serious quality with<br />  no-rush that will increase productivity and the<br />  quality of products and<br />  services, without losing the essence of spirit.</p>
<p>  In the movie, Scent of a Woman, there's a scene<br />  where Al Pacino asks a girl<br />  to dance and she replies, "I can't, my boyfriend<br />  will be here any minute<br />  now". To which Al responds, "A life is lived in an<br />  instant". Then they dance<br />  to a tango.</p>
<p>  Many of us live our lives running behind time, but<br />  we only reach it when we<br />  die of a heart attack or in a car accident rushing<br />  to be on time. Others are<br />  so anxious of living the future that they forget to<br />  live the present, which<br />  is the only time that truly exists. We all have<br />  equal time throughout the<br />  world. No one has more or less. The difference lies<br />  in how each one of us<br />  does with our time. We need to live each moment. As<br />  John Lennon said, *"Life<br />  is what happens to you while you're busy making<br />  other plans".<br />  *Congratulations for reading till the end of this<br />  message. There are many<br />  who will have stopped in the middle so as not to<br />  waste time in this<br />  globalized world.</p>

          [Forward]: Slowdown culture        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p></p>
<blockquote><p>  *An interesting reflection: *Slow Down Culture</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Very good mail.</p>
<p>There is a proverb in tibet:<br />"If you want to go to a place quickly - walk slowly<br />If you want to go to a place damn fast - walk very slowly"</p>
<p>This is to tell that walk slowly towords your ambitions and goals<br />without missing the fun of life</p>
<p>This means your journey is as interesting or even more interesting<br />than your destination</p>
<p>There are many stories in zen buddhism which stress this central<br />concept in many ways</p>
<p>Osho has dealt with it in a brilliant manner. He goes to the very<br />depth of the philosophy of time and why west caught up with this<br />concept of fast life. No offence meant to our christian friends - but<br />he actually says that it was mainly because of a fundamental concept<br />about time in christianity.</p>
<p>In hinduism &amp; buddhism (and even jainism) you have come here - to this<br />world - many times. And you will come many more times. So there is no<br />hurry. You are finishing off some of the things that were left undone<br />during your last visit. It is a long and wonderful journey. Your<br />journey does not end with your physical death. You have another<br />chance. Hence you have lot of time.</p>
<p>But the christian faith is different. You come here only once. There<br />is no chance for coming here again. Hence it puts lot of pressure on<br />humans. There is so much that needs to be done in ones life and very<br />little time left ! Hence everything needs to be done within a span of<br />60 to 80 years. Hurry up ! And as western philosophy spread across the<br />world this concept spread all over.</p>
<p>And alas ! Now, it is in the land of buddhism - china / japan etc -<br />where the culture of working more than 40 hours a week is well<br />established ! And it is now in the christian world that slowing down<br />is being looked at seriously.</p>
<p>The good thing about globalization and shrinking world is that humans<br />all over have started looking at other cultures.Time tested<br />philosophies are undergoing massive transformation</p>
<p>We are living in an interesting era</p>
<p>Love<br />G</p>

        <p>Dear Sivakumar,</p>
<p>That is VERY VERY INTERESTING AND OPT MESSAGE.</p>
<p>There have been Corporate Sogans too:</p>
<p>1. WE ARE SLOW, BUT SURE.<br />2. WE ARE SILENT BECAUSE WE ARE SOUND.</p>
<p>As rightly pointed Slow does not mean sacrificing anything .. Very slow<br />is a different matter.</p>
<p>And that John Lennon (Beatles) quote "while you are planning Life is<br />happening" is a wonderful much talked about Quote ...</p>
<p>And I do wish to look into myself for an answer to look at my attidue<br />to my fellow citizen to compare with your friend's that other's may have<br />not time to walk....</p>
<p>Very nice posting..</p>
<p>Thank you so much..</p>
<p>Best regards/</p>
