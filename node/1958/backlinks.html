</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear All,</p>
<p>You all know how the Thanjai Mupperum Vizha went on from the Press <br />release and <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a>, mails from our team members etc. I <br />wanted to write about my experience about the Two day trip to the <br />group all these days, but was held up with my work so much that I <br />could not find time. Initially I thought, anyway Varalaaru team will <br />write a payanakkatturai and so didnt think about it seriously. But <br />Gokul was encouraging me to write a first hand report which might be <br />followed by a Payanakkatturai by the varalaaru team. So thought I <br />will force myself to find time today to finish this task.</p>
<p>After waving Good bye to the Varalaaru team on 25th(I think I wrote <br />about this earlier) for the trip, Shankaran and I were in constant <br />touch with them as to know about their whereabouts. We both were <br />fuming(literally) when we heard that they visited Gangai Konda <br />Cholapuram. It is one of the few places which I was dreaming for <br />long, to visit. </p>
<p>On Firday, the most awaited 28th evening, at 9.30 Shankarn, Sriram<br />(Ram and Lavanyas friend) and I met at the Tambaram station and <br />waited for the Train. The train started late by around 45 mins and we <br />all reached Kumbakkonam around 8.00 in the morning. Kamal,Gokul and <br />his brother were waiting for us. They picked us and dropped at a <br />house, which they said belongs to SPS's son. We should be thankful to <br />SPS for making arrangements to make available the key to the locked <br />house where we could freshen up and start for the tour. Dropping us <br />there Gokul and Kamal went to their hotel to get ready. The entire <br />team,Kamal, Gokul,his brother,Lavanya, Kriupa,Sasi,Ram came back in <br />the van to pick us up. We all went to 'Mami's mess' for Breakfast. <br />Excellent tiffin which we all relished, at unbelievable rates..After <br />finishing the Breakfast, Krupa's punch dialogue came,by which we all <br />were spell bound-"naan rendu moonu mani neram kooda saapdama <br />eruppene"...-:)</p>
<p>Balaji picked up Dr.Kudavoil Balu from Thanjai and joined us at <br />Kumbakkonam. It was fornuate for our entire team, especially the <br />first timers, that Dr.KV came as a guide for us. We were thrilled. <br />First he took us to Sarangapani temple and explained about <br />the 'karanas' in the raja gopuram. We spent nearly an hour there <br />listening to his lecture. Then he took us Ramaswamy temple where he <br />narrated the beautiful sotry of how and who constructed that temple. <br />A movie can be made out of that fascinating history of the <br />Vijayanagara emperors.</p>
<p>Leaving Kumbakkonam, he took us to Patteeswaram and explained about <br />the art and architecture there. He was very much upset when he told <br />us that some beautiful nayak period paintings in the ceiling of the <br />goupram were erased by Sandblasting in the name of renovation. He <br />said those beautiful pictures are in his photos alone and even a <br />trace of them has not been left there. After touring Patteswaram <br />temple, he took us to 'Aaraivadathali', another padal petra <br />sthalam, and said the lingam there is one the most beautiful one, he <br />has ever seen. When we entered the temple we were shell shocked see <br />it dilapated condition. Dr.Kv said this is 100 times better than how <br />it was 5 years back, when he found it. He said the sourrounding <br />peopel were using that temple as toilet and the numerous lingams in <br />the temple premisis were being used to tie buffalows and cows. On his <br />request, on noble soul(I forgot that persons name) came forward to <br />build a compound wall around so that encroachments can be avoided. it <br />was a beautiful temple and the lingam was very beautiful. </p>
<p>Then we all went to Panchavanmadevi Pallipadai. Again, that temple <br />also was in a very worst condition. Dr.KV said, he brought some <br />students and history lovers to repair the entrance mandapam of that <br />temple. Dr.KV said there are two shool of thought - one is that this <br />pallipadaid is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's wife Panchavanmadevi's pallipadai and another is <br />that this is <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym 's wife Panchavanmadevi pallipadai. Dr.KV <br />substantiated with his own proofs that it was <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's wife <br />Panchavanmadevi's pallipadai and not <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym 's wife as told by others. He <br />shows architectural proofs for this as well as quoted other <br />kalvettu's substantiating this point. He also showed the long <br />kalvettu, where the word 'Pallipadia' has been intentionally damaged <br />but still the word could be read with the impression. We all left <br />that place without a desire to do so.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>In the mean time, Mr.Seetharaman, SPS's subordinate joined us who was <br />very much helpful through the rest of the trip. We all went to a <br />hotel for lunch and relaxed a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym . After Lunch Dr.KV said he has some <br />work in his office and after finishing it will join us again at <br />Kandiyur. We also went back to our nest's to pack up and headed <br />towards Kandiyur and roamed around the temple there. Around 5.30 <br />Dr.KV joined us again and took us to a place which was a thennan <br />thoppu. We travelled taking twists and turns as if going through a <br />maze. He showed us hundreds of siva lingams in two three temples <br />there on the way all of same size and shape. Then we all sat in the <br />tennan thoppu to listen to Dr.Kv's lecture. He narrated a historical <br />story about a place called Nandipuram which was of great importance <br />during Pallavas, Cholas and then Pandiyas, which had a 'Aaayiran <br />thali' which was destroyed by Malik Kafoor. After narrating the great <br />story, he said, he is convinced that the place where we were sitting <br />should be Nandipuram and if excavations are done we can get lots of <br />proofs in terms of sculptures, palaces etc. Dr.KV said that whereever <br />they dig the earth, they can find lingams and even they found a very <br />big lingam which could not be taken out by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  and hence was <br />reburried. He said this place should have had the aayiram thali, <br />which was very much exciting for us to hear.On the way back SPS <br />joined us and volunteered to drop Lavanya, Sriram and Ram at the <br />Thiruvaiyaru aaradhanai vizha. </acronym></acronym></p>
<p>By then it was very dark and we all headed to Thanjai, thanking Dr.Kv <br />for his time and effort. Such a great person, spending his whole day <br />for some amatures like us, was something great. We all had dinner <br />with Dr.KV and bid good bye to him thanking for his time. We all were <br />tired that after some discussion we went to bed. Later the next <br />morning only heard that Kamal,Gokul,Krupa were working on the web <br />pages to launch varalaaru sirappidhaz online, till 4 in the morning.</p>
<p>The next morning all got ready for the mupperum vizha. Sasi and I <br />went in search of a DTP center to take print outs of the varalaaru CD <br />which was to be released that day. Being Sunday no shop was open and <br />at last we found one where we started taking print outs. Half <br />way through the shop person said he is short of A4 size papers, and <br />Sasi and I were very much tensed by then. It was already 10 and the <br />function started near the big temple. One hand we were tensed for <br />missing the beautiful programme, on the other we both were tensed <br />for getting the print outs ready. Later we managed with A5 sheets cut <br />in to A4 size and rushed to the venue at 10.30. By then Kamal and <br />Gokul were quite tensed as we didnt arrive on time. I think I need <br />not explain about the function as much of it had been already <br />discussed by SPS and article is being published in varalaaru.</p>
<p>We(the first timers) got the great oppurtunity to meet Dr.KK, <br />Dr.Rajavelu of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  and other prominent people. After lunch, on our <br />request Dr.Rajavelu agreed to take us inside the prohibited area of <br />the big temple. We were very much fortunate enought to visit those <br />places which normal people can never dream of. After relishing the <br />splendour of the big temple and having a great time talking with <br />Dr.KK, Dr.Rajavelu etc. we winded up our tour with a sense of <br />happiness and a urge to learn more of history.</acronym></p>
<p>Thanks to the varalaaru team who organized the entire thing very <br />smoothly. It was a lovely experience which cant be expressed in <br />words.Hope to have many more trips in the future and hope the members <br />grow in size everytime.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  - As the mail was typed during different time period of the day, <br />amidst my work load,their might be some mistakes, lacks continuity <br />etc.(I didnt read it again).So kindly excuse for any mistakes and <br />omissions.</acronym></p>

          Thanjai Trip - A delayed FIR.        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Satish<br />Late vandhalum Latesta Vandeenga!!!!<br />that was a beautiful report of a great event<br />Fantastic Information Report!!<br />Thanks<br />Sri</p>
<p>SatishKumar Arunachalam <satisharun@gmail.com  wrote:</p>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>You all know how the Thanjai Mupperum Vizha went on from the Press <br />release and <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a>, mails from our team members etc. I <br />wanted to write about my experience about the Two day trip to the <br />group all these days, but was held up with my work so much that I <br />could not find time. Initially I thought, anyway Varalaaru team will <br />write a payanakkatturai and so didnt think about it seriously. But <br />Gokul was encouraging me to write a first hand report which might be <br />followed by a Payanakkatturai by the varalaaru team. So thought I <br />will force myself to find time today to finish this task.</p>
<p>After waving Good bye to the Varalaaru team on 25th(I think I wrote <br />about this earlier) for the trip, Shankaran and I were in constant <br />touch with them as to know about their whereabouts. We both were <br />fuming(literally) when we heard that they visited Gangai Konda <br />Cholapuram. It is one of the few places which I was dreaming for <br />long, to visit. </p>
<p>On Firday, the most awaited 28th evening, at 9.30 Shankarn, Sriram<br />(Ram and Lavanyas friend) and I met at the Tambaram station and <br />waited for the Train. The train started late by around 45 mins and we <br />all reached Kumbakkonam around 8.00 in the morning. Kamal,Gokul and <br />his brother were waiting for us. They picked us and dropped at a <br />house, which they said belongs to SPS's son. We should be thankful to <br />SPS for making arrangements to make available the key to the locked <br />house where we could freshen up and start for the tour. Dropping us <br />there Gokul and Kamal went to their hotel to get ready. The entire <br />team,Kamal, Gokul,his brother,Lavanya, Kriupa,Sasi,Ram came back in <br />the van to pick us up. We all went to 'Mami's mess' for Breakfast. <br />Excellent tiffin which we all relished, at unbelievable rates..After <br />finishing the Breakfast, Krupa's punch dialogue came,by which we all <br />were spell bound-"naan rendu moonu mani neram kooda saapdama <br />eruppene"...-:)</p>
<p>Balaji picked up Dr.Kudavoil Balu from Thanjai and joined us at <br />Kumbakkonam. It was fornuate for our entire team, especially the <br />first timers, that Dr.KV came as a guide for us. We were thrilled. <br />First he took us to Sarangapani temple and explained about <br />the 'karanas' in the raja gopuram. We spent nearly an hour there <br />listening to his lecture. Then he took us Ramaswamy temple where he <br />narrated the beautiful sotry of how and who constructed that temple. <br />A movie can be made out of that fascinating history of the <br />Vijayanagara emperors.</p>
<p>Leaving Kumbakkonam, he took us to Patteeswaram and explained about <br />the art and architecture there. He was very much upset when he told <br />us that some beautiful nayak period paintings in the ceiling of the <br />goupram were erased by Sandblasting in the name of renovation. He <br />said those beautiful pictures are in his photos alone and even a <br />trace of them has not been left there. After touring Patteswaram <br />temple, he took us to 'Aaraivadathali', another padal petra <br />sthalam, and said the lingam there is one the most beautiful one, he <br />has ever seen. When we entered the temple we were shell shocked see <br />it dilapated condition. Dr.Kv said this is 100 times better than how <br />it was 5 years back, when he found it. He said the sourrounding <br />peopel were using that temple as toilet and the numerous lingams in <br />the temple premisis were being used to tie buffalows and cows. On his <br />request, on noble soul(I forgot that persons name) came forward to <br />build a compound wall around so that encroachments can be avoided. it <br />was a beautiful temple and the lingam was very beautiful. </p>
<p>Then we all went to Panchavanmadevi Pallipadai. Again, that temple <br />also was in a very worst condition. Dr.KV said, he brought some <br />students and history lovers to repair the entrance mandapam of that <br />temple. Dr.KV said there are two shool of thought - one is that this <br />pallipadaid is <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's wife Panchavanmadevi's pallipadai and another is <br />that this is <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym 's wife Panchavanmadevi pallipadai. Dr.KV <br />substantiated with his own proofs that it was <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's wife <br />Panchavanmadevi's pallipadai and not <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJ</acronym 's wife as told by others. He <br />shows architectural proofs for this as well as quoted other <br />kalvettu's substantiating this point. He also showed the long <br />kalvettu, where the word 'Pallipadia' has been intentionally damaged <br />but still the word could be read with the impression. We all left <br />that place without a desire to do so.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>In the mean time, Mr.Seetharaman, SPS's subordinate joined us who was <br />very much helpful through the rest of the trip. We all went to a <br />hotel for lunch and relaxed a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym . After Lunch Dr.KV said he has some <br />work in his office and after finishing it will join us again at <br />Kandiyur. We also went back to our nest's to pack up and headed <br />towards Kandiyur and roamed around the temple there. Around 5.30 <br />Dr.KV joined us again and took us to a place which was a thennan <br />thoppu. We travelled taking twists and turns as if going through a <br />maze. He showed us hundreds of siva lingams in two three temples <br />there on the way all of same size and shape. Then we all sat in the <br />tennan thoppu to listen to Dr.Kv's lecture. He narrated a historical <br />story about a place called Nandipuram which was of great importance <br />during Pallavas, Cholas and then Pandiyas, which had a 'Aaayiran <br />thali' which was destroyed by Malik Kafoor. After narrating the great <br />story, he said, he is convinced that the place where we were sitting <br />should be Nandipuram and if excavations are done we can get lots of <br />proofs in terms of sculptures, palaces etc. Dr.KV said that whereever <br />they dig the earth, they can find lingams and even they found a very <br />big lingam which could not be taken out by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  and hence was <br />reburried. He said this place should have had the aayiram thali, <br />which was very much exciting for us to hear.On the way back SPS <br />joined us and volunteered to drop Lavanya, Sriram and Ram at the <br />Thiruvaiyaru aaradhanai vizha. </acronym></acronym></p>
<p>By then it was very dark and we all headed to Thanjai, thanking Dr.Kv <br />for his time and effort. Such a great person, spending his whole day <br />for some amatures like us, was something great. We all had dinner <br />with Dr.KV and bid good bye to him thanking for his time. We all were <br />tired that after some discussion we went to bed. Later the next <br />morning only heard that Kamal,Gokul,Krupa were working on the web <br />pages to launch varalaaru sirappidhaz online, till 4 in the morning.</p>
<p>The next morning all got ready for the mupperum vizha. Sasi and I <br />went in search of a DTP center to take print outs of the varalaaru CD <br />which was to be released that day. Being Sunday no shop was open and <br />at last we found one where we started taking print outs. Half <br />way through the shop person said he is short of A4 size papers, and <br />Sasi and I were very much tensed by then. It was already 10 and the <br />function started near the big temple. One hand we were tensed for <br />missing the beautiful programme, on the other we both were tensed <br />for getting the print outs ready. Later we managed with A5 sheets cut <br />in to A4 size and rushed to the venue at 10.30. By then Kamal and <br />Gokul were quite tensed as we didnt arrive on time. I think I need <br />not explain about the function as much of it had been already <br />discussed by SPS and article is being published in varalaaru.</p>
<p>We(the first timers) got the great oppurtunity to meet Dr.KK, <br />Dr.Rajavelu of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  and other prominent people. After lunch, on our <br />request Dr.Rajavelu agreed to take us inside the prohibited area of <br />the big temple. We were very much fortunate enought to visit those <br />places which normal people can never dream of. After relishing the <br />splendour of the big temple and having a great time talking with <br />Dr.KK, Dr.Rajavelu etc. we winded up our tour with a sense of <br />happiness and a urge to learn more of history.</acronym></p>
<p>Thanks to the varalaaru team who organized the entire thing very <br />smoothly. It was a lovely experience which cant be expressed in <br />words.Hope to have many more trips in the future and hope the members <br />grow in size everytime.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  - As the mail was typed during different time period of the day, <br />amidst my work load,their might be some mistakes, lacks continuity <br />etc.(I didnt read it again).So kindly excuse for any mistakes and <br />omissions.</acronym></p>
