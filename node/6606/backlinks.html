<p>Most Welcome dear Vira Rajendra..</p>
<p>Glad to note that you are an Engineer.. History lover..</p>
<p>And researching in Overseas expeditions.. Wonderful..</p>
<p>Let us await your views.... Very best wishes.</p>
<p>Re son and daughters of RRC I : </p>
<p>To this date, Rajendra I, Nadivirpenn @ Madhavedigal and Kundavi w/o <br />Vimladithan are known as his children.</p>
<p>No other name has come to light with an inscriptional evidence.</p>
<p>Re Peruvudayar Kudamuzhukku :: as you have seen the KALASAM was given <br />on 275th day in 25th year .. which has been taken as the date by <br />Sastry, SRB, Sethuraman and others ...</p>
<p>THAT PARTICULAR INSCRIPTION IS A VERY VERY SPECIAL ONE.. THROWING <br />MORE LIGHT ON CHOLA (RRC / RjC) HISTORY .. </p>
<p>We will take this with text for a detailed discussion in due course.</p>
<p>Re GKC Temple construction :: Pls look into Chidambaram <br />inscriptions... since Rajendra was operating from Chidambaram (closer <br />to Bay of Bengal - probably Puhar and Nagai should have been much <br />more active in 1023 - 1030AD atleast !) over here when the GKC temple <br />was constructed.</p>
<p>VIRA RAJENDRA is a very very interesting name in History too.</p>
<p>Chozha geneology is known through Rajendra I's Thiruvalangadu Copper <br />plates, his Aanamangalam (Leyden ) Grants and the THIRD source is <br />VIRARAJENDRA's KANYAKUMARI Inscriptions!</p>
<p>We have Rajendra chola in our Group already... apart from <br />adithakarikala!  </p>
<p>Again most welcome Veera Rajendra !</p>

<blockquote><p>      With the victorius expedition of Rajendra Cholan - 1 to Ganges <br />in<br />      A.D.1023, he claimed a new title as "Gangaikondaan" and gave <br />the title</p></blockquote>
<p>"Gangaikonda Cholan" (the Chola who captured Gangai) to his younger <br />brother who lead the Gangetic expedition. .<br />=================</p></virarajendra@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  3)<br />      His overseas war expedition went up to Kadarem and Sri Vijaya - <br />the<br />      present Kedah and Perak regions of Malaysia, and the present <br />Palembang<br />      region of Sumatra in Indonesia,being the foremost regions of <br />their<br />      interest 'among others' in theirSouth-East Asian war <br />expedition. With<br />      his triumps over these regionsRajendra Chola - 1 assumed <br />another new<br />      title as "Kadaremkondaan", and one of his grandson who lead the<br />  Kadarem<br />      expedition was given the title "Kadaremkonda Cholan", (the Chola<br />  who who<br />      captured Kadarem), and a region of the present Narasingapuram <br />in Tamil<br />      Nadu was named as the "Kadaremkonda Cholapuram".</p>
<p>    This is interesting - we dont see any references to the kadaram<br />    campaign outside of India and am yet to see any specific <br />references <br />    of who led the campaign. pl furnish supportings so that we can all<br />    appreciate this.</p>
<p>    4) <br />      The "Vimanam" of this big temple goes to a height of 176 ft <br />falling<br />      short in height to the Rajarajaeswarem temple of Rajaraja Chola-<br />1, and<br />      the construction of this temple was completed and the Kumba-<br />abishekam<br />      done, possibly around A.D.1028.</p>
<p>    I seem to have missed this reference - as to how the date of<br />    completion of the GKC temple comes up, pl share with us</p>
<p>    5)<br />      Notes:<br />      The Siva and Vishnu temples of the Chola period had <br />tall "Vimanams"<br />      (tower over - Karuvarai i.e. Sanctum Sanctorium of the <br />temples). This<br />      could be seen in the temples namely Rajarajaeswarem <br />(Birahatheeswarem)<br />      at Thanjavur, Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem at Udaiyar Paalayam (in<br />      Kumbakonam), Rajarajaeswarem (Airaavatheswarem) at Darasuram<br />      (Palaiyaarai) built by Rajaraja Cholan - 2 (A.D.1146-1163),<br />      Thiribhuvanaeswarem (Kampaheswarem) at Thiribhuvanam built by<br />  Kulothunga<br />      Cholan - 3 (A.D.1178-1218), and others.</p>
<p>    All the temples you list above are shiva temples. namely tanjore, <br />gkc,<br />    darasuram, and tribuvanam - can you share info on vishnu temples <br />which<br />    were built by cholas and which had vimanams taller than the <br />gopuram.<br />    from my understanding again ( i could be wrong) only tanjore and <br />gkc<br />    vimanams were designed to be built taller than the gopurams - to<br />    signify their 'maha meru' concepts.</p>

<p>  --------------------------------------------------------------------<br />  REPLY FROM VIRARAJENDRA</p>
<p>  Reply to query No - 1</p>
<p>  The inscription of RRC under reference says "??.Yandu<br />  Irupaththaingjavathu, Naal Irunootrelupaththu-thainginaal Udaiyaar <br />Sri<br />  Rajarajathevar Sri Rajarajeehwaram Udaiyaar SriVimaanaththu sembin<br />  isthoopith-thariyil "vaikka kuduththa" seppukudam ontru nirai<br />  moovayirathuenpathu, mupalaththil surukkina thahadu pala pon<br />  adavallaan ennum kallalnirai irandaayiraththu tholaayirathu <br />irupthaaru<br />  kanlanj sarai?."</p>
<p>  (A.D.1010) RRC gave the kudam to "vaikka" (i.e.given to place on <br />Thari<br />  but not yet placed) and donated gold for coating the top finial. It <br />is<br />  after this day and year - the gold plating and the final finish on <br />the<br />  Finial was done - with 90 days left to complete same in the year - <br />on<br />  ground level, and then to erect same at the top of the 216 ft high<br />  Vimanam with final finish, and dressing. This would have definetely<br />  covered this period of 90 days. Only after fitting the Finial on <br />the<br />  Vimanam and other final finishes the Kumba-abishekam would have been<br />  done, which would have definitely fallen in to the year A.D.1011.</p>
<p>  This is why the 26th year Inscription in A.D.1011(985 + 26) of RRC <br />in<br />  the same place in this temple mentions "....(at) Thanjavur in<br />  Thanjavur Kootram the 'sacred granite-stone temple' (Thiru-Kat-<br />trali)<br />  I got it erected, the Sri Rajarajeeswaram Udaiyar....."</p>
<p>  Reply to query No - 2</p>
<p>  Historically we know RRC had a lawful Queen Vaanavan Maadevi and <br />10 -<br />  other <br />  Theviayar. Rajendra Chola - 1 was the lawful heir to the throne by<br />  Vanavan Maadevi. The sons of other Theviyar of Rajaraja Chola - 1 <br />too<br />  are considered as brothers (more precisely step brothers) of <br />Rajendra<br />  Chola ? 1 who took part in active roles - as Chola commanders<br />  (generals) on various war expeditions, and also as chieftains of<br />  various regions of the Chola empire under the ruling Chola kings. <br />They<br />  were given titles bearing the name of the regions they successfully<br />  captured on behalf of the respective Chola kings.</p>
<p>Prince<br />  who went on war expedition to Ganges River successfully, was his<br />  "?.Siriya Thaathai meaning Siriya Thanthai or Father's younger<br />  brother?." who has been given the title by the father of Rajendra<br />  Chola - 2 being the Rajendra Chola - 1 as "Gangaikonda Cholan".<br />  Rajendra Chola - 1 hence assumed the title "Gangaikondaan" for <br />himself.</p>
<p>  Likewise from the same Mikeerthi we note one of the sons (Kathalar) <br />of<br />  Rajendra Chola - 2, being the grandson of Rajendra Chola -1, on <br />behalf<br />  of him went on the Kadarem expedition which he successfully captured<br />  and was given the title as Kadaramkonda Cholan. Hence Rajendra <br />Chola ?<br />  1 himself assumed the title the Kadarem Kondaan.   </p>
<p>  Reply to query No - 3</p>
<p>  Separate research paper is being prepared by me o be published soon<br />  under the title " The medieval Chola Empire and its relations with<br />  Malaysia and Indonesia", which will give you much informations on<br />  same. Await same. </p>
<p>  Reply to query No - 4</p>
<p>  GKC finished his Gangetic expedition in A.D.1023 for sure. <br />Immediately<br />  after his return to Chola country he started the construction of his<br />  new capital city Gangaikonda Cholapuram, the Siva temple <br />Gaingaikonda<br />  Cholaeswarem and the Chola Gangam.<br />  It took seven years for Rajaraja Chola to construct the <br />Rajarajeswarem<br />  temple. But we have positive dates from nthe inscriptions. But in<br />  respect of Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem we have no such positive <br />evidence.<br />  But being an Engineer myself I could approximately studying the <br />extent<br />  of both complexes estimate the time frame for construction of<br />  Gangalkonda Cholaeswarem as five years. Hence Ib arrived at an<br />  approximate date of completion of construction of Gangaikonda<br />  Cholaeswarem as A.D.1028 (1023 + 5).  </p>
<p>  Reply to query No - 5</p>
<p>  Thanks for querying on same but will reply soon.</p>

<p>  Dear Sivapathasekaran,</p>
<p>  "Thanking you very much" for your "very warm welcome". However I <br />wish<br />  to inform you that I am not new to "Ponniyin Selvan". I too can<br />  remember you by name from around A.D.2004. </p>
<p>  My earlier postings and the other members's discussions on my<br />  articles, are ranging from Message No 4013 to 4442 in "ponniyin<br />  selvan" if I am correct. </p>
<p>  Earlier my postings were under my own name. Now I am writing my<br />  articles under my "Pen Name" - Virarajendra.</p>
<p>  I am 64 years old, as such "I wish to accelerate" writing my <br />articles<br />  and research papers on Tamil History, Culture, Fine Arts and many <br />more<br />  related subjects before my health fails. Hence I thought "ponniyin<br />  selvan" is the appropriate website to place "some of my artilcles" <br />and<br />  hence I have come into scene again. Many of my recent new articles -<br />  some of which that have already appeared in "ponniyin selvan" <br />earlier,<br />  can also be seen presently in the website mayyam.com </p>

<p>    Most Welcome dear Vira Rajendra..</p>
<p>    Glad to note that you are an Engineer.. History lover..</p>
<p>    And researching in Overseas expeditions.. Wonderful..</p>
<p>    Let us await your views.... Very best wishes.</p>
<p>    Re son and daughters of RRC I : </p>
<p>    To this date, Rajendra I, Nadivirpenn @ Madhavedigal and Kundavi <br />w/o <br />    Vimladithan are known as his children.</p>
<p>    No other name has come to light with an inscriptional evidence.</p>
<p>    Re Peruvudayar Kudamuzhukku :: as you have seen the KALASAM was <br />given <br />    on 275th day in 25th year .. which has been taken as the date by <br />    Sastry, SRB, Sethuraman and others ...</p>
<p>    THAT PARTICULAR INSCRIPTION IS A VERY VERY SPECIAL ONE.. THROWING <br />    MORE LIGHT ON CHOLA (RRC / RjC) HISTORY .. </p>
<p>    We will take this with text for a detailed discussion in due <br />course.</p>
<p>    Re GKC Temple construction :: Pls look into Chidambaram <br />    inscriptions... since Rajendra was operating from Chidambaram <br />(closer <br />    to Bay of Bengal - probably Puhar and Nagai should have been much <br />    more active in 1023 - 1030AD atleast !) over here when the GKC <br />temple <br />    was constructed.</p>
<p>    VIRA RAJENDRA is a very very interesting name in History too.</p>
<p>    Chozha geneology is known through Rajendra I's Thiruvalangadu <br />Copper <br />    plates, his Aanamangalam (Leyden ) Grants and the THIRD source is <br />    VIRARAJENDRA's KANYAKUMARI Inscriptions!</p>
<p>    We have Rajendra chola in our Group already... apart from <br />    adithakarikala!  </p>
<p>    Again most welcome Veera Rajendra !</p>

<p>    With the victorius expedition of Rajendra Cholan - 1 to Ganges <br />    in A.D.1023, he claimed a new title as "Gangaikondaan" and gave <br />    the title "Gangaikonda Cholan" (the Chola who captured Gangai)to  <br />    his younger brother who lead the Gangetic expedition. <br />    =================</p>
<p>    His overseas war expedition went up to Kadarem and Sri Vijaya - <br />    the present Kedah and Perak regions of Malaysia, and the present <br />    Palembang region of Sumatra in Indonesia,being the foremost <br />regions <br />    of their interest 'among others' in their South-East Asian war <br />    expedition. With his triumps over these regionsRajendra Chola - 1<br />  assumed <br />    another new<br />          title as "Kadaremkondaan", and one of his grandson who lead <br />the<br />      Kadarem<br />          expedition was given the title "Kadaremkonda Cholan", (the <br />Chola<br />      who who<br />          captured Kadarem), and a region of the present <br />Narasingapuram <br />    in Tamil<br />          Nadu was named as the "Kadaremkonda Cholapuram".</p>
<p>        This is interesting - we dont see any references to the <br />kadaram<br />        campaign outside of India and am yet to see any specific <br />    references <br />        of who led the campaign. pl furnish supportings so that we <br />can all<br />        appreciate this.</p>
<p>        4) <br />          The "Vimanam" of this big temple goes to a height of 176 ft <br />    falling<br />          short in height to the Rajarajaeswarem temple of Rajaraja <br />Chola-<br />    1, and<br />          the construction of this temple was completed and the Kumba-<br />    abishekam<br />          done, possibly around A.D.1028.</p>
<p>        I seem to have missed this reference - as to how the date of<br />        completion of the GKC temple comes up, pl share with us</p>
<p>        5)<br />          Notes:<br />          The Siva and Vishnu temples of the Chola period had <br />    tall "Vimanams"<br />          (tower over - Karuvarai i.e. Sanctum Sanctorium of the <br />    temples). This<br />          could be seen in the temples namely Rajarajaeswarem <br />    (Birahatheeswarem)<br />          at Thanjavur, Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem at Udaiyar Paalayam <br />(in<br />          Kumbakonam), Rajarajaeswarem (Airaavatheswarem) at Darasuram<br />          (Palaiyaarai) built by Rajaraja Cholan - 2 (A.D.1146-1163),<br />          Thiribhuvanaeswarem (Kampaheswarem) at Thiribhuvanam built <br />by<br />      Kulothunga<br />          Cholan - 3 (A.D.1178-1218), and others.</p>
<p>        All the temples you list above are shiva temples. namely <br />tanjore, <br />    gkc,<br />        darasuram, and tribuvanam - can you share info on vishnu <br />temples <br />    which<br />        were built by cholas and which had vimanams taller than the <br />    gopuram.<br />        from my understanding again ( i could be wrong) only tanjore <br />and <br />    gkc<br />        vimanams were designed to be built taller than the gopurams - <br />to<br />        signify their 'maha meru' concepts.</p>

<p>      ----------------------------------------------------------------<br />----<br />      REPLY FROM VIRARAJENDRA</p>
<p>      Reply to query No - 1</p>
<p>      The inscription of RRC under reference says "??.Yandu<br />      Irupaththaingjavathu, Naal Irunootrelupaththu-thainginaal <br />Udaiyaar <br />    Sri<br />      Rajarajathevar Sri Rajarajeehwaram Udaiyaar SriVimaanaththu <br />sembin<br />      isthoopith-thariyil "vaikka kuduththa" seppukudam ontru nirai<br />      moovayirathuenpathu, mupalaththil surukkina thahadu pala pon<br />      adavallaan ennum kallalnirai irandaayiraththu tholaayirathu <br />    irupthaaru<br />      kanlanj sarai?."</p>
<p>year<br />      (A.D.1010) RRC gave the kudam to "vaikka" (i.e.given to place <br />on <br />    Thari<br />      but not yet placed) and donated gold for coating the top <br />finial. It <br />    is<br />      after this day and year - the gold plating and the final finish <br />on <br />    the<br />      Finial was done - with 90 days left to complete same in the <br />year - <br />    on<br />      ground level, and then to erect same at the top of the 216 ft <br />high<br />      Vimanam with final finish, and dressing. This would have <br />definetely<br />      covered this period of 90 days. Only after fitting the Finial <br />on <br />    the<br />      Vimanam and other final finishes the Kumba-abishekam would have <br />been<br />      done, which would have definitely fallen in to the year <br />A.D.1011.</p>
<p>      This is why the 26th year Inscription in A.D.1011(985 + 26) of <br />RRC <br />    in<br />      the same place in this temple mentions "....(at) Thanjavur in<br />      Thanjavur Kootram the 'sacred granite-stone temple' (Thiru-Kat-<br />    trali)<br />      I got it erected, the Sri Rajarajeeswaram Udaiyar....."</p>
<p>      Reply to query No - 2</p>
<p>      Historically we know RRC had a lawful Queen Vaanavan Maadevi <br />and <br />    10 -<br />      other <br />      Theviayar. Rajendra Chola - 1 was the lawful heir to the throne <br />by<br />      Vanavan Maadevi. The sons of other Theviyar of Rajaraja Chola - <br />1 <br />    too<br />      are considered as brothers (more precisely step brothers) of <br />    Rajendra<br />      Chola ? 1 who took part in active roles - as Chola commanders<br />      (generals) on various war expeditions, and also as chieftains of<br />      various regions of the Chola empire under the ruling Chola <br />kings. <br />    They<br />      were given titles bearing the name of the regions they <br />successfully<br />      captured on behalf of the respective Chola kings.</p>
<p>very<br />    Prince<br />      who went on war expedition to Ganges River successfully, was his<br />      "?.Siriya Thaathai meaning Siriya Thanthai or Father's younger<br />      brother?." who has been given the title by the father of <br />Rajendra<br />      Chola - 2 being the Rajendra Chola - 1 as "Gangaikonda Cholan".<br />      Rajendra Chola - 1 hence assumed the title "Gangaikondaan" for <br />    himself.</p>
<p>      Likewise from the same Mikeerthi we note one of the sons <br />(Kathalar) <br />    of<br />      Rajendra Chola - 2, being the grandson of Rajendra Chola -1, on <br />    behalf<br />      of him went on the Kadarem expedition which he successfully <br />captured<br />      and was given the title as Kadaramkonda Cholan. Hence Rajendra <br />    Chola ?<br />      1 himself assumed the title the Kadarem Kondaan.   </p>
<p>      Reply to query No - 3</p>
<p>      Separate research paper is being prepared by me o be published <br />soon<br />      under the title " The medieval Chola Empire and its relations <br />with<br />      Malaysia and Indonesia", which will give you much informations <br />on<br />      same. Await same. </p>
<p>      Reply to query No - 4</p>
<p>      GKC finished his Gangetic expedition in A.D.1023 for sure. <br />    Immediately<br />      after his return to Chola country he started the construction <br />of his<br />      new capital city Gangaikonda Cholapuram, the Siva temple <br />    Gaingaikonda<br />      Cholaeswarem and the Chola Gangam.<br />      It took seven years for Rajaraja Chola to construct the <br />    Rajarajeswarem<br />      temple. But we have positive dates from nthe inscriptions. But <br />in<br />      respect of Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem we have no such positive <br />    evidence.<br />      But being an Engineer myself I could approximately studying the <br />    extent<br />      of both complexes estimate the time frame for construction of<br />      Gangalkonda Cholaeswarem as five years. Hence Ib arrived at an<br />      approximate date of completion of construction of Gangaikonda<br />      Cholaeswarem as A.D.1028 (1023 + 5).  </p>

        <p>Dear Sivapathasekaran,</p>
<p>"Thanking you very much" for your "very warm welcome". However I wish<br />to inform you that I am not new to "Ponniyin Selvan". I too can<br />remember you by name from around A.D.2004. </p>
<p>My earlier postings and the other members's discussions on my<br />articles, are ranging from Message No 4013 to 4442 in "ponniyin<br />selvan" if I am correct. </p>
<p>Earlier my postings were under my own name. Now I am writing my<br />articles under my "Pen Name" - Virarajendra.</p>
<p>I am 64 years old, as such "I wish to accelerate" writing my articles<br />and research papers on Tamil History, Culture, Fine Arts and many more<br />related subjects before my health fails. Hence I thought "ponniyin<br />selvan" is the appropriate website to place "some of my artilcles" and<br />hence I have come into scene again. Many of my recent new articles -<br />some of which that have already appeared in "ponniyin selvan" earlier,<br />can also be seen presently in the website mayyam.com </p>
<p>Mikka anbudan <br />Virarajendra  </p>

<p>  Most Welcome dear Vira Rajendra..</p>
<p>  Glad to note that you are an Engineer.. History lover..</p>
<p>  And researching in Overseas expeditions.. Wonderful..</p>
<p>  Let us await your views.... Very best wishes.</p>
<p>  Re son and daughters of RRC I : </p>
<p>  To this date, Rajendra I, Nadivirpenn @ Madhavedigal and Kundavi w/o <br />  Vimladithan are known as his children.</p>
<p>  No other name has come to light with an inscriptional evidence.</p>
<p>  Re Peruvudayar Kudamuzhukku :: as you have seen the KALASAM was given <br />  on 275th day in 25th year .. which has been taken as the date by <br />  Sastry, SRB, Sethuraman and others ...</p>
<p>  THAT PARTICULAR INSCRIPTION IS A VERY VERY SPECIAL ONE.. THROWING <br />  MORE LIGHT ON CHOLA (RRC / RjC) HISTORY .. </p>
<p>  We will take this with text for a detailed discussion in due course.</p>
<p>  Re GKC Temple construction :: Pls look into Chidambaram <br />  inscriptions... since Rajendra was operating from Chidambaram (closer <br />  to Bay of Bengal - probably Puhar and Nagai should have been much <br />  more active in 1023 - 1030AD atleast !) over here when the GKC temple <br />  was constructed.</p>
<p>  VIRA RAJENDRA is a very very interesting name in History too.</p>
<p>  Chozha geneology is known through Rajendra I's Thiruvalangadu Copper <br />  plates, his Aanamangalam (Leyden ) Grants and the THIRD source is <br />  VIRARAJENDRA's KANYAKUMARI Inscriptions!</p>
<p>  We have Rajendra chola in our Group already... apart from <br />  adithakarikala!  </p>
<p>  Again most welcome Veera Rajendra !</p>

<p>  With the victorius expedition of Rajendra Cholan - 1 to Ganges <br />  in A.D.1023, he claimed a new title as "Gangaikondaan" and gave <br />  the title "Gangaikonda Cholan" (the Chola who captured Gangai)to  <br />  his younger brother who lead the Gangetic expedition. <br />  =================</p>
<p>  His overseas war expedition went up to Kadarem and Sri Vijaya - <br />  the present Kedah and Perak regions of Malaysia, and the present <br />  Palembang region of Sumatra in Indonesia,being the foremost regions <br />  of their interest 'among others' in their South-East Asian war <br />  expedition. With his triumps over these regionsRajendra Chola - 1<br />assumed <br />  another new<br />        title as "Kadaremkondaan", and one of his grandson who lead the<br />    Kadarem<br />        expedition was given the title "Kadaremkonda Cholan", (the Chola<br />    who who<br />        captured Kadarem), and a region of the present Narasingapuram <br />  in Tamil<br />        Nadu was named as the "Kadaremkonda Cholapuram".</p>
<p>      This is interesting - we dont see any references to the kadaram<br />      campaign outside of India and am yet to see any specific <br />  references <br />      of who led the campaign. pl furnish supportings so that we can all<br />      appreciate this.</p>
<p>      4) <br />        The "Vimanam" of this big temple goes to a height of 176 ft <br />  falling<br />        short in height to the Rajarajaeswarem temple of Rajaraja Chola-<br />  1, and<br />        the construction of this temple was completed and the Kumba-<br />  abishekam<br />        done, possibly around A.D.1028.</p>
<p>      I seem to have missed this reference - as to how the date of<br />      completion of the GKC temple comes up, pl share with us</p>
<p>      5)<br />        Notes:<br />        The Siva and Vishnu temples of the Chola period had <br />  tall "Vimanams"<br />        (tower over - Karuvarai i.e. Sanctum Sanctorium of the <br />  temples). This<br />        could be seen in the temples namely Rajarajaeswarem <br />  (Birahatheeswarem)<br />        at Thanjavur, Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem at Udaiyar Paalayam (in<br />        Kumbakonam), Rajarajaeswarem (Airaavatheswarem) at Darasuram<br />        (Palaiyaarai) built by Rajaraja Cholan - 2 (A.D.1146-1163),<br />        Thiribhuvanaeswarem (Kampaheswarem) at Thiribhuvanam built by<br />    Kulothunga<br />        Cholan - 3 (A.D.1178-1218), and others.</p>
<p>      All the temples you list above are shiva temples. namely tanjore, <br />  gkc,<br />      darasuram, and tribuvanam - can you share info on vishnu temples <br />  which<br />      were built by cholas and which had vimanams taller than the <br />  gopuram.<br />      from my understanding again ( i could be wrong) only tanjore and <br />  gkc<br />      vimanams were designed to be built taller than the gopurams - to<br />      signify their 'maha meru' concepts.</p>

<p>    --------------------------------------------------------------------<br />    REPLY FROM VIRARAJENDRA</p>
<p>    Reply to query No - 1</p>
<p>    The inscription of RRC under reference says "??.Yandu<br />    Irupaththaingjavathu, Naal Irunootrelupaththu-thainginaal Udaiyaar <br />  Sri<br />    Rajarajathevar Sri Rajarajeehwaram Udaiyaar SriVimaanaththu sembin<br />    isthoopith-thariyil "vaikka kuduththa" seppukudam ontru nirai<br />    moovayirathuenpathu, mupalaththil surukkina thahadu pala pon<br />    adavallaan ennum kallalnirai irandaayiraththu tholaayirathu <br />  irupthaaru<br />    kanlanj sarai?."</p>
<p>    (A.D.1010) RRC gave the kudam to "vaikka" (i.e.given to place on <br />  Thari<br />    but not yet placed) and donated gold for coating the top finial. It <br />  is<br />    after this day and year - the gold plating and the final finish on <br />  the<br />    Finial was done - with 90 days left to complete same in the year - <br />  on<br />    ground level, and then to erect same at the top of the 216 ft high<br />    Vimanam with final finish, and dressing. This would have definetely<br />    covered this period of 90 days. Only after fitting the Finial on <br />  the<br />    Vimanam and other final finishes the Kumba-abishekam would have been<br />    done, which would have definitely fallen in to the year A.D.1011.</p>
<p>    This is why the 26th year Inscription in A.D.1011(985 + 26) of RRC <br />  in<br />    the same place in this temple mentions "....(at) Thanjavur in<br />    Thanjavur Kootram the 'sacred granite-stone temple' (Thiru-Kat-<br />  trali)<br />    I got it erected, the Sri Rajarajeeswaram Udaiyar....."</p>
<p>    Reply to query No - 2</p>
<p>    Historically we know RRC had a lawful Queen Vaanavan Maadevi and <br />  10 -<br />    other <br />    Theviayar. Rajendra Chola - 1 was the lawful heir to the throne by<br />    Vanavan Maadevi. The sons of other Theviyar of Rajaraja Chola - 1 <br />  too<br />    are considered as brothers (more precisely step brothers) of <br />  Rajendra<br />    Chola ? 1 who took part in active roles - as Chola commanders<br />    (generals) on various war expeditions, and also as chieftains of<br />    various regions of the Chola empire under the ruling Chola kings. <br />  They<br />    were given titles bearing the name of the regions they successfully<br />    captured on behalf of the respective Chola kings.</p>
<p>  Prince<br />    who went on war expedition to Ganges River successfully, was his<br />    "?.Siriya Thaathai meaning Siriya Thanthai or Father's younger<br />    brother?." who has been given the title by the father of Rajendra<br />    Chola - 2 being the Rajendra Chola - 1 as "Gangaikonda Cholan".<br />    Rajendra Chola - 1 hence assumed the title "Gangaikondaan" for <br />  himself.</p>
<p>    Likewise from the same Mikeerthi we note one of the sons (Kathalar) <br />  of<br />    Rajendra Chola - 2, being the grandson of Rajendra Chola -1, on <br />  behalf<br />    of him went on the Kadarem expedition which he successfully captured<br />    and was given the title as Kadaramkonda Cholan. Hence Rajendra <br />  Chola ?<br />    1 himself assumed the title the Kadarem Kondaan.   </p>
<p>    Reply to query No - 3</p>
<p>    Separate research paper is being prepared by me o be published soon<br />    under the title " The medieval Chola Empire and its relations with<br />    Malaysia and Indonesia", which will give you much informations on<br />    same. Await same. </p>
<p>    Reply to query No - 4</p>
<p>    GKC finished his Gangetic expedition in A.D.1023 for sure. <br />  Immediately<br />    after his return to Chola country he started the construction of his<br />    new capital city Gangaikonda Cholapuram, the Siva temple <br />  Gaingaikonda<br />    Cholaeswarem and the Chola Gangam.<br />    It took seven years for Rajaraja Chola to construct the <br />  Rajarajeswarem<br />    temple. But we have positive dates from nthe inscriptions. But in<br />    respect of Gangaikonda Cholaeswarem we have no such positive <br />  evidence.<br />    But being an Engineer myself I could approximately studying the <br />  extent<br />    of both complexes estimate the time frame for construction of<br />    Gangalkonda Cholaeswarem as five years. Hence Ib arrived at an<br />    approximate date of completion of construction of Gangaikonda<br />    Cholaeswarem as A.D.1028 (1023 + 5).  </p>

<p>    Thanks for querying on same but will reply soon.</p></virarajendra@></p></blockquote>
