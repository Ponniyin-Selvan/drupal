<p>      Friends,</p>
<p>      Count me in on the 26th of Aug. Kolar and Nandhi hills are in<br />    opposite direction. I would suggest to stick to places on one of this<br />    direction and likewise Talakadu is on the South-Western direction. </p>
<p>      Mr. Krishnan,</p>
<p>      Talakadu, Chennapatna, Melkote will be in one direction(all towns<br />    are within 30kms on both sides of Srirangapatna) , returning time will<br />    be slightly at 8pm to 9pm, if we leave bangalore by 7am in the<br />morning.</p>
<p>      Kolar - we will need a seperate day to visit may places from your<br />    original list.</p>
<p>      Nandi Hills - same as kolar,as there are lots of hillocks with<br />    temples, eg. Devarayanadurga, savanthdurga, etc.</p>

<p>      Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />      day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th)<br />around<br />      7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at<br />  7.00PM.</p>
<p>      We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the<br />places<br />      by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>      Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />      cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont<br />know abt<br />      the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />      road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>      Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>        Sir,</p>
<p>        I have a feeling that planning a one-day trip(with a max of 2 - 3<br />      places) would be ideal as you would get to see and know about things<br />      in detail about a particular place or location.</p>
<p>        Planning for too many places in 1 or 2 days might leave us with a<br />      shallow experience.</p>
<p>        let me know everyone's opinions and we can plan the trip<br />  accordingly.</p>

<p>      We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the<br />places<br />      by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>      Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />      cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont<br />know abt<br />      the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />      road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>      Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>      Friends,</p>
<p>      Count me in on the 26th of Aug. Kolar and Nandhi hills are in<br />    opposite direction. I would suggest to stick to places on one of this<br />    direction and likewise Talakadu is on the South-Western direction. </p>
<p>      Mr. Krishnan,</p>
<p>      Talakadu, Chennapatna, Melkote will be in one direction(all towns<br />    are within 30kms on both sides of Srirangapatna) , returning time will<br />    be slightly at 8pm to 9pm, if we leave bangalore by 7am in the<br />morning.</p>
<p>      Kolar - we will need a seperate day to visit may places from your<br />    original list.</p>
<p>      Nandi Hills - same as kolar,as there are lots of hillocks with<br />    temples, eg. Devarayanadurga, savanthdurga, etc.</p>

<p>    Friends,</p>
<p>    Count me in on the 26th of Aug. Kolar and Nandhi hills are in<br />  opposite direction. I would suggest to stick to places on one of this<br />  direction and likewise Talakadu is on the South-Western direction. </p>
<p>    Mr. Krishnan,</p>
<p>    Talakadu, Chennapatna, Melkote will be in one direction(all towns<br />  are within 30kms on both sides of Srirangapatna) , returning time will<br />  be slightly at 8pm to 9pm, if we leave bangalore by 7am in the morning.</p>
<p>    Kolar - we will need a seperate day to visit may places from your<br />  original list.</p>
<p>    Nandi Hills - same as kolar,as there are lots of hillocks with<br />  temples, eg. Devarayanadurga, savanthdurga, etc.</p>
<p>    Regards<br />    Nanda</p>

<p>    Kindly confirm individual participation in our Trip cum bangalore meet</p>
<p>    the following places are with in a radius of 75 Km fro Bangalore<br />  East and North east.</p>
<p>    1. Kolar</p>
<p>    2.Nandhi Hills </p>
<p>    3. Begur</p>
<p>    This visit is possible in a day very comfortably if a vehicle is<br />  hired.</p>

<p>    Suganya <suganya_ml@  wrote:<br />    So....we have plenty of places around Banglore to explore with.</suganya_ml@></p>
<p>    Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />    day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th) around<br />    7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at<br />7.00PM.</p>
<p>    We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the places<br />    by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>    Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />    cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont know abt<br />    the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />    road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>    Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>      Sir,</p>
<p>      I have a feeling that planning a one-day trip(with a max of 2 - 3<br />    places) would be ideal as you would get to see and know about things<br />    in detail about a particular place or location.</p>
<p>      Planning for too many places in 1 or 2 days might leave us with a<br />    shallow experience.</p>
<p>      let me know everyone's opinions and we can plan the trip<br />accordingly.</p>

<p>So now we have minimum .No of Participants and i am ready with all Bus routes . I have enquired the Tempo Traveller Van ( Brand New ) for our Trip Possibly with Tamil Driver conversent with Kannada who is our official contracter for transportation. , The Charges are as follows</p>
<p>Tempo Traveller .Rent Approx., Rs.1950/- @ Rs.7.50 Km -1 + Rs200/- Driver Charges<br />For around 250 kms. I have to Confirm the Date with Travels Co. and Place of Pick up and Drop ( One Place ) after receiving the suggestions from Participants. </p>
<p>So once again all have to Confirm the Date and Commom Point for Pick Up and Drop.</p>

<p>Please drop "madam" while addressing me. I am a small girl still! :))</p>
<p>Now the attendees list is slightly reduced, but still my grand mother<br />also wants to attend this trip.</p>
<p>Hence, the attendees are, </p>
<p>1. SanthanaKrishnan <br />2. Madan<br />3. Abiramalakshmi<br />4. Bhuvaneswari<br />5. Chandrasekaran (plastics_chandra)<br />6. Suganya<br />7. Suganya's mother<br />8. Suganya's grand-mother<br />9. Nandakumar<br />10. Mrs. Nandakumar</p>
<p>We can still go ahead with a tempo-traveller. Money can be collected<br />on the spot and paid in the travels office. Else, if some money has to<br />be given as advance, then we should do it beforehand.</p>
<p>I am assuming that the food expenses would be taken care by the<br />individuals and the money is collected only for the transportation.</p>
<p>Let us have a great time on 26th.</p>
<p>Regards<br />Suganya</p>

<p>      Friends,</p>
<p>      Count me in on the 26th of Aug. Kolar and Nandhi hills are in<br />    opposite direction. I would suggest to stick to places on one of this<br />    direction and likewise Talakadu is on the South-Western direction. </p>
<p>      Mr. Krishnan,</p>
<p>      Talakadu, Chennapatna, Melkote will be in one direction(all towns<br />    are within 30kms on both sides of Srirangapatna) , returning time will<br />    be slightly at 8pm to 9pm, if we leave bangalore by 7am in the<br />morning.</p>
<p>      Kolar - we will need a seperate day to visit may places from your<br />    original list.</p>
<p>      Nandi Hills - same as kolar,as there are lots of hillocks with<br />    temples, eg. Devarayanadurga, savanthdurga, etc.</p>
<p>      Regards<br />      Nanda</p>

<p>      the following places are with in a radius of 75 Km fro Bangalore<br />    East and North east.</p>
<p>      1. Kolar</p>
<p>      2.Nandhi Hills </p>
<p>      3. Begur</p>
<p>      This visit is possible in a day very comfortably if a vehicle is<br />    hired.</p>

<p>      Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />      day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th)<br />around<br />      7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at<br />  7.00PM.</p>
<p>      We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the<br />places<br />      by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>      Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />      cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont<br />know abt<br />      the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />      road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>      Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>        Sir,</p>
<p>        I have a feeling that planning a one-day trip(with a max of 2 - 3<br />      places) would be ideal as you would get to see and know about things<br />      in detail about a particular place or location.</p>
<p>        Planning for too many places in 1 or 2 days might leave us with a<br />      shallow experience.</p>
<p>        let me know everyone's opinions and we can plan the trip<br />  accordingly.</p>

<p>      Friends,</p>
<p>      Count me in on the 26th of Aug. Kolar and Nandhi hills are in<br />    opposite direction. I would suggest to stick to places on one of this<br />    direction and likewise Talakadu is on the South-Western direction. </p>
<p>      Mr. Krishnan,</p>
<p>      Talakadu, Chennapatna, Melkote will be in one direction(all towns<br />    are within 30kms on both sides of Srirangapatna) , returning time will<br />    be slightly at 8pm to 9pm, if we leave bangalore by 7am in the<br />morning.</p>
<p>      Kolar - we will need a seperate day to visit may places from your<br />    original list.</p>
<p>      Nandi Hills - same as kolar,as there are lots of hillocks with<br />    temples, eg. Devarayanadurga, savanthdurga, etc.</p>
<p>      Regards<br />      Nanda</p>

<p>      Kindly confirm individual participation in our Trip cum<br />bangalore meet</p>
<p>      the following places are with in a radius of 75 Km fro Bangalore<br />    East and North east.</p>
<p>      1. Kolar</p>
<p>      2.Nandhi Hills </p>
<p>      3. Begur</p>
<p>      This visit is possible in a day very comfortably if a vehicle is<br />    hired.</p>

<p>      Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />      day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th)<br />around<br />      7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at<br />  7.00PM.</p>
<p>      We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the<br />places<br />      by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>      Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />      cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont<br />know abt<br />      the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />      road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>      Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>        Sir,</p>
<p>        I have a feeling that planning a one-day trip(with a max of 2 - 3<br />      places) would be ideal as you would get to see and know about things<br />      in detail about a particular place or location.</p>
<p>        Planning for too many places in 1 or 2 days might leave us with a<br />      shallow experience.</p>
<p>        let me know everyone's opinions and we can plan the trip<br />  accordingly.</p>

        <p>GSK sir,</p>
<p>Please drop "madam" while addressing me. I am a small girl still! :))</p>
<p>Now the attendees list is slightly reduced, but still my grand mother<br />also wants to attend this trip.</p>
<p>Hence, the attendees are, </p>
<p>1. SanthanaKrishnan <br />2. Madan<br />3. Abiramalakshmi<br />4. Bhuvaneswari<br />5. Chandrasekaran (plastics_chandra)<br />6. Suganya<br />7. Suganya's mother<br />8. Suganya's grand-mother<br />9. Nandakumar<br />10. Mrs. Nandakumar</p>
<p>We can still go ahead with a tempo-traveller. Money can be collected<br />on the spot and paid in the travels office. Else, if some money has to<br />be given as advance, then we should do it beforehand.</p>
<p>I am assuming that the food expenses would be taken care by the<br />individuals and the money is collected only for the transportation.</p>
<p>Let us have a great time on 26th.</p>

<p>      Talakadu, Chennapatna, Melkote will be in one direction(all towns<br />    are within 30kms on both sides of Srirangapatna) , returning time will<br />    be slightly at 8pm to 9pm, if we leave bangalore by 7am in the<br />morning.</p>
<p>      Kolar - we will need a seperate day to visit may places from your<br />    original list.</p>
<p>      Nandi Hills - same as kolar,as there are lots of hillocks with<br />    temples, eg. Devarayanadurga, savanthdurga, etc.</p>
<p>      Regards<br />      Nanda</p>

<p>      Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />      day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th)<br />around<br />      7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at<br />  7.00PM.</p>
<p>      We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the<br />places<br />      by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>      Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />      cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont<br />know abt<br />      the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />      road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>      Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>    Friends,</p>
<p>    Count me in on the 26th of Aug. Kolar and Nandhi hills are in<br />  opposite direction. I would suggest to stick to places on one of this<br />  direction and likewise Talakadu is on the South-Western direction. </p>
<p>    Mr. Krishnan,</p>
<p>    Talakadu, Chennapatna, Melkote will be in one direction(all towns<br />  are within 30kms on both sides of Srirangapatna) , returning time will<br />  be slightly at 8pm to 9pm, if we leave bangalore by 7am in the morning.</p>
<p>    Kolar - we will need a seperate day to visit may places from your<br />  original list.</p>
<p>    Nandi Hills - same as kolar,as there are lots of hillocks with<br />  temples, eg. Devarayanadurga, savanthdurga, etc.</p>

<p>    Kindly confirm individual participation in our Trip cum bangalore meet</p>
<p>    the following places are with in a radius of 75 Km fro Bangalore<br />  East and North east.</p>
<p>    1. Kolar</p>
<p>    2.Nandhi Hills </p>
<p>    3. Begur</p>
<p>    This visit is possible in a day very comfortably if a vehicle is<br />  hired.</p>

<p>    Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />    day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th) around<br />    7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at<br />7.00PM.</p>
<p>    We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the places<br />    by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>    Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />    cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont know abt<br />    the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />    road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>    Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>      Sir,</p>
<p>      I have a feeling that planning a one-day trip(with a max of 2 - 3<br />    places) would be ideal as you would get to see and know about things<br />    in detail about a particular place or location.</p>
<p>      Planning for too many places in 1 or 2 days might leave us with a<br />    shallow experience.</p>
<p>      let me know everyone's opinions and we can plan the trip<br />accordingly.</p>

<p>  Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />  day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th) around<br />  7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at 7.00PM.</p>
<p>  We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the places<br />  by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>  Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />  cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont know abt<br />  the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />  road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>  Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>    I have a feeling that planning a one-day trip(with a max of 2 - 3<br />  places) would be ideal as you would get to see and know about things<br />  in detail about a particular place or location.</p>
<p>    Planning for too many places in 1 or 2 days might leave us with a<br />  shallow experience.</p>

<p>    Planning for too many places in 1 or 2 days might leave us with a<br />  shallow experience.</p>
<p>    let me know everyone's opinions and we can plan the trip accordingly.</p>

<p>  Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />  day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th) around<br />  7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at 7.00PM.</p>
<p>  We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the places<br />  by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>  Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />  cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont know abt<br />  the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />  road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>  Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>Count me in on the 26th of Aug. Kolar and Nandhi hills are in opposite direction. I would suggest to stick to places on one of this direction and likewise Talakadu is on the South-Western direction. </p>
<p>Mr. Krishnan,</p>
<p>Talakadu, Chennapatna, Melkote will be in one direction(all towns are within 30kms on both sides of Srirangapatna) , returning time will be slightly at 8pm to 9pm, if we leave bangalore by 7am in the morning.</p>
<p>Kolar - we will need a seperate day to visit may places from your original list.</p>
<p>Nandi Hills - same as kolar,as there are lots of hillocks with temples, eg. Devarayanadurga, savanthdurga, etc.</p>

<p>the following places are with in a radius of 75 Km fro Bangalore East and North east.</p>
<p>1. Kolar</p>

<p>Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th) around<br />7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at 7.00PM.</p>
<p>We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the places<br />by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont know abt<br />the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>  Let us nail down to the list of places which can be covered in one<br />  day. We shall start on a saturday morning (either 19th or 26th) around<br />  7.30 am and plan such that we will reach back Bangalore city at 7.00PM.</p>
<p>  We can hire a cab for one day. Let us plan to visit to all the places<br />  by organising one trip per month. :))</p>
<p>  Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />  cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont know abt<br />  the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />  road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>  Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>    Sir,</p>
<p>    I have a feeling that planning a one-day trip(with a max of 2 - 3<br />  places) would be ideal as you would get to see and know about things<br />  in detail about a particular place or location.</p>
<p>    Planning for too many places in 1 or 2 days might leave us with a<br />  shallow experience.</p>
<p>    let me know everyone's opinions and we can plan the trip accordingly.</p>

          PS Meeting in Bangalore ....Again!!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Friends,</p>
<p>Count me in on the 26th of Aug. Kolar and Nandhi hills are in opposite direction. I would suggest to stick to places on one of this direction and likewise Talakadu is on the South-Western direction. </p>
<p>Mr. Krishnan,</p>
<p>Talakadu, Chennapatna, Melkote will be in one direction(all towns are within 30kms on both sides of Srirangapatna) , returning time will be slightly at 8pm to 9pm, if we leave bangalore by 7am in the morning.</p>
<p>Kolar - we will need a seperate day to visit may places from your original list.</p>
<p>Nandi Hills - same as kolar,as there are lots of hillocks with temples, eg. Devarayanadurga, savanthdurga, etc.</p>

<p>Coming to list of places for the first trip, my opinion is we shall<br />cover places which are located adjacent to each other. I dont know abt<br />the location of the places suggested. I know that Kolar is in Madras<br />road whereas Nandhi Hills is in Hyderabad road.</p>
<p>Experts, please finalise the places for an one day trip.</p>

<p>    Hi verey PSG members of bangalore<br />    are the bangalore PSG members ready for a adventure trip?. They <br />can <br />    go to Kolar and al places around Kolar like Kendatti Madivala, <br />Arbi <br />    Kotnur, Sivarapatna ( one centre where the are still some <br />stapathis, <br />    at least 10years back when i explsored the area)has excellent <br />    inscriptions of Cholas. Kolaramma temple itself is an <br />interesting <br />    temple as it is one of the few exclusive temple dedicated to <br />    Saptamatrikas. Rajaraja did not change the temple in any way as <br />it <br />    is the presiding deity of the region. The inscriptions are one <br />on <br />    the way of temple management. The original ancient shrine still <br />has <br />    the stucco saptamatrika images. The other shrine with stone is <br />under <br />    worship.</p>
<p>    About 25 km from Kolar on the Malur-Bangarpet road is small <br />hillock <br />    called Banahallibetta. There are some extraodinary rock shelters <br />    right on the top ( large as a cinemahall)with peremnnial water <br />    spring. Needs local guide as you have to jump few crevices of <br />    about ??? deep. Once you reach there the experience is so <br />    exhilerating. When you clime you can do so by the sloping edge <br />of <br />    the hillock, and you climb down, you do it rihjt through the <br />    boulders in the dark. </p>
<p>    There is a fantastic neolithic habitation site below with 300 <br />years <br />    old potsherds strewn around. There is an image of Chola period <br />    Chamuda in a rockshelter. </p>

        <p>Hi Suganya,</p>
<p>Yep, Madan is from chennai. Lets see we conduct a <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  chapter meeting on 20th as you said, I would still prefer to have a meeting before that just to familiarise with everybody else.. 5th at meenakshi temple - bannerghatta road, is good for me.. </p>
<p>Just let me know the time for the meeting tomm, preferably in the evening.</p>
<p>Regards<br />Nanda</p>
<p>Suganya <suganya_ml@yahoo.com  wrote:<br />Pls Hold On....</suganya_ml@yahoo.com></p>
<p>First of all, I dont know who are all from Blore. I assumed Madan is<br />from Blore but seems its Nanda, who is here.</p>
<p>Anyway, let us first finalize the venue, date and agenda. Let us go<br />for a trip to Nandi hills on 20th Aug, sunday. We can hire a Tempo or<br />Qualis depending on the number of people.</p>
<p>Now, pls put fwd ur convenience and suggestions. Also, anyone from<br />Chennai wants to join on that weekend are also most welcome.</p>

<p>    This time do not miss to plan for Nandhi hills trip. It is worth <br />    visiting. Chola inscriptions are little more clear and easy to read. <br />    And some good sculptures too.</p>
<p>    Regarding the place, Why dont you check up in ASI office in <br />    bangalore if they have any meeting hall or library. It is a chance <br />    to meet some epigraphists also.</p>

<p>I heard 4 or 5 thamizh people and many thamizh books are there. But, <br />it didnt strike to me that it is holiday for <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  on weekends. So, <br />rule out that idea. :-) Trip to Nandhi hills would be better.</acronym></p>
<p>Chennai people also can plan something like visiting Manimangalam <br />(just 8 km from tambaram) or Madambakkam (between velacheri and <br />tambaram, paranthaga temple).</p>
<p>Thanks<br />Kamal</p>

          PS Meeting in Bangalore ....Again!!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Wonderful idea, Kamal......</p>
<p>Instead of just a meet, why not a trip to Nandhi Hills ? On the way we<br />can have good discussions....It can be a small one day trip.</p>
<p>Meeting in <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  Office, we need to check out for their permission.<br />Initially, we need to get to know them and introduce us....(Language<br />problem vera irrukku....though English is there to help!!)</acronym></p>
<p>Suggestions...Welcome.</p>

<p>  This time do not miss to plan for Nandhi hills trip. It is worth <br />  visiting. Chola inscriptions are little more clear and easy to read. <br />  And some good sculptures too.</p>
<p>  Regarding the place, Why dont you check up in ASI office in <br />  bangalore if they have any meeting hall or library. It is a chance <br />  to meet some epigraphists also.</p>
