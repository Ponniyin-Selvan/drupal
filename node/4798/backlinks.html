<p>R. N. Iyengar</p>
<p>Strong earthquakes in quick succession in the country have heightened<br />the sensitivity of the common man towards this natural phenomenon.<br />Effects of earthquakes can be so severe as to cause social and<br />political upheavals apart from property damage.</p>
<p>Thus mitigation of seismic risk in big cities is a matter of concern<br />to engineers and administrators alike. All the current scientific<br />approaches the world over, depend on historical records for estimating<br />the seismic hazard in a given region.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Indian subcontinent, reliable data on place and<br />date are available for the past two hundred years only. A recent work<br />undertaken by<br />Iyengar et al.1 has led to a reliable identification of another twenty<br />earthquake occurrences in the medieval period (12?18th century AD).<br />This still leaves the ancient period almost blank except for stray<br />references. However, this does not mean that ancient Indians were not<br />fascinated or not affected by earthquakes. </p>
<p>The Vedas, Puranas and the epics contain many references to<br />earthquakes and allied phenomena. But what may be of interest in the<br />contemporary context, are the writings of persons who were acclaimed<br />scholars of their days. There exist a large number of writings in<br />Sanskrit on natural phenomena. Among these, at least two are available<br />in print namely, Brihat Samhita (B.S.) of Varaha Mihira2 (5?6th<br />century AD) and Adbhuta Sagara (A.S.) of Ballala Sena3 (10?11th<br />century AD).</p>
<p>Discussion on causes of earthquakes had been a perennial topic in<br />ancient Indian literature. According to A.S., the opinion of Kashyapa<br />was that earthquakes were due to movement of sea creatures, whereas<br />Garga opined that it was due to the sigh of elephants carrying the earth.</p>
<p>According to Vasishta, tremors were due to interaction of two strong<br />winds which eventually impacted the oceans and shook the earth.<br />Another opinion was that earthquakes occurred due to chance or unseen<br />forces. Finally, both B.S. and A.S. give an explanation due to<br />Parashara that once upon a time mountains could fly and move. Thus<br />they were frequently falling on the earth causing earthquakes<br />continuously. At the request of the earth, the Creator ordered Indra<br />(thunder) to cut the wings of the mountains so that the earth became<br />stable. </p>
<p>Yet, the four elements namely Wind, Fire and Water along with Indra<br />cause the earth to shake. This explanation originating from the Rig<br />Veda has been given in the two texts as a rudimentary theory on<br />formation of stable continents and not in any religious sense. Ballala<br />Sena quotes another writer Ushanas, who was categorical that the four<br />elements shake the earth in the four quarters east, south, west and<br />Parashara was of the opinion that eclipses and planetary aberrations<br />could also cause earthquakes. Over the centuries this idea might have<br />been given up since A.S. does not list this reason.</p>
<p>After discussing the causes, both the books turn their attention to<br />classification of earthquakes into four groups, depending on the time<br />of occurrence and the reigning stellar constellation. Thus, an<br />earthquake which occurs from north in the last quarter of the night or<br />in the first quarter of the day under any of the stars Asvini,<br />Mrigasira, Punarvasu, Hasta, Chitta, Svati or Uttarapalguni belongs to<br />the wind group (Vayavya). </p>
<p>The directions of occurrence are not explicitly mentioned in B.S.<br />These were given by Ushanas as quoted in A.S. It is also mentioned<br />that many scholars do not accept the classification based on the time<br />of occurrence. Similarly, earthquakes of the Agni (fire), Indra and<br />Varuna (water) group originate from south, east and west, respectively<br />and are governed by specific star groups. Neither of the books<br />indicate how the directions are to be fixed. It is observed that so<br />far the effort has been only to group the earthquakes after their<br />occurrence, according to some recognizable attributes.</p>
<p>About the effects of earthquakes, Varaha Mihira does not mention about<br />damages to buildings. However other writers are categorical that<br />Vayu-type earthquakes lead to extensive destruction of houses,<br />monasteries, temples, palaces, towers and forts. The after-effects<br />mentioned are occurrences of windstorms within a week after such an<br />earthquake. Similarly, the Agni-type earthquake induces surface fires<br />engulfing villages and towns.</p>
<p>Rivers and water sources dry up. Indra-type tremors, lead to rains<br />and elimination of pest colonies. The Varuna-type earthquake kills<br />people living along river and sea coasts. Earthquakes were also<br />supposed to be a portent for impending death of kings, outbreak of<br />wars and epidemics. In B.S. the list of regions affected, is short,<br />whereas information given in A.S. from various sources including those<br />of B.S. is more exhaustive. The geographical regions disturbed by<br />earthquakes according to both the books are as follows.</p>
<p>Vayu-type earthquake</p>
<p>B.S.: Saurashtra, Kuru, Magadha, Dasarna, Matsya; A.S.: Yavana,<br />Dandaka, Salva, Sauvardhana, Pulinda, Videha, Nala, Darada, Anga,<br />Vanga, Avanti, Malva, Trigarta, Sauvira, Yaudheya, Ksudraka, Shivika,<br />Madraka, Shaka, Kamboja, Bahlika, Gandhara, Kalinga, Sabara, Mlechha,<br />Tangana.</p>
<p>Agni-type earthquake</p>
<p>B.S.: Ashmaka, Anga, Bahlika, Tangana, Kalinga, Vanga, Dravida,<br />Shabara; A.S.: Pulinda, Yavana, Odhra, Avanti, Iksvaku, Kuluta,<br />Tushara, Shivika, Trigarta, Videha, Surastra, Madhyadesh, Dasarna.</p>
<p>Indra-type earthquake</p>
<p>B.S.: Kashi, Yugandhara, Paurava,<br />Kirata, Kira, Abhisara, Hala, Madra,<br />Arbuda, Saurastra, Malva; A.S.: Kashmira, Dravida, Andhaka, China,<br />Prachya, Shaka, Pahlava, Dandaka, Kailasa, Malla, Vahala.</p>
<p>Varuna-type earthquake</p>
<p>B.S.: Gonarda, Chedi, Kukkura, Kirata, Videha; A.S.: Kashmira, Parata,<br />Vatsa, Abraka, Karusha, Sinhala.</p>
<p>It was recognized by all the authors that earthquakes may occur under<br />any star at any time. Thus, combination-type earthquakes became<br />possible. The places affected by such mixed-type tremors as mentioned<br />by Parashara, are reported in A.S.</p>
<p>Vayu?Agni: Kuru, Salva, Matsya, Nishadha, Pundra, Andhra, Kalinga,<br />Vindhya foothills.</p>
<p>Vayu?Indra: Prachya, Shaka, China, Pahlava, Yaudheya, Yavana, Magadha.</p>
<p>Vayu?Varuna: Avantika, Pulinda, Videha, Kashmira, Darada.</p>
<p>Agni?Indra: Ikshvaku, Patachara, Abhira, China, Barukacha.</p>
<p>Agni?Varuna: Gonarda, Anganarajya, Coastal regions.</p>
<p>Indra?Varuna: Kashi, Abhisara, Achyuta, Kachadvipa.</p>
<p>The effects of these earthquakes were supposed to be a combination of<br />the effects of the primary types described earlier. Many of the places<br />in the list given earlier are easily identifiable with their<br />present-day equivalents. Several regions are outside the present-day<br />Indian political boundary. </p>
<p>In Figure 1, the regions are marked taking into account the ancient<br />geography of India as described in the works of Kautilya, Varaha<br />Mihira, Bana, Kalhana and others. A question may arise as to how<br />widespread the knowledge was about seismic regions in ancient times,<br />and whether Dravida was in South India. Fortunately, a book in<br />Kannada, Lokopakarakam, written in 1025 AD by Chamunda Raya4 under the<br />patronage of the Chalukyan king Jayasimha is available as a<br />cross-reference. This author devotes briefly eight stanzas for<br />describing the four types of earthquakes. For the Vayu-type<br />earthquake, he indicates the affected places as Kurumagadha, Magadha,<br />Dravida and Kuntala. In his own explanation, Chamunda Raya identifies<br />Dravida with Tigula Desha</p>
<p>(Tamil country). For Agni-type earthquakes he includes in his list<br />Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Kerala, Bahlika and Dravida. According to this<br />book, Indra-type earthquakes affect only Saurashtra and Abhisara; whereas Varuna-type earthquakes affect Videha, Govardhana, Nishadha<br />and Vihara.</p>
<p>Interpretation of old texts concerning natural phenomena is difficult.<br />Still, seen critically from the present-day perspective the<br />delineation of the country into four major seismic zones of differing<br />damage types, 1500 years ago is no mean achievement. This indicates<br />some kind of observation and data collection. All the regions listed<br />are presently known to be susceptible to earthquakes. But it is<br />interesting to note that Dravida (Tamil country), Kuntala (North<br />Karnataka), Ashmaka (Maharashtra), Andhra and Odhra (Orissa) were<br />considered to be earthquake prone to varying degrees. </p>
<p>A significantly quantitative approach to earthquakes is reflected in<br />the ancient writings. Vayu-type earthquake was unanimously accepted as<br />the most destructive. Opinions differed about the other three. Some<br />held that Agni-, Varuna-, and Indra-type earthquakes in that order<br />were decreasingly harmful. It was perhaps in this context that the<br />ancient writings introduced the extent of ground shaking as a measure<br />of the four types. Ballala Sena in his A.S. first cites the book<br />Bhargaviya which perhaps belongs to a period earlier than B.S.<br />According to this text, the extent of ground shaking is 200 yojanas<br />during Vayu-type earthquake. The corresponding values for Agni-,<br />Indra- and Varuna-type earthquakes are given as 90, 80 and 70 yojanas,<br />respectively. It may be speculated that this order was a reflection of<br />the descending order of socially harmful effects associated with the<br />four types of tremors. Varaha Mihira agrees with only the first value<br />and for the other three, his values are Varuna-type 180, Indra-type<br />160, and Agni-type 110. No information is available on how these were<br />obtained or measured. However, these values are amenable for </p>
<p>interpretation from a contemporary perspective. One yojana is equal to<br />6 miles or 9.6 km as per actual measurements carried out by Stein5, of<br />distances mentioned by Kalhana in his Rajatarangini. Thus, Vayu-type<br />earthquakes could have had a radius of area of perceptibility of (100<br />yojana) 960 km.</p>
<p>This may be compared with some modern values. The mean radius of<br />percep-tibility for the great earthquakes of Assam (1897) and Bihar<br />(1934) were 1440 km and 1280 km, respectively6. The level of human<br />perceptibility for ground acceleration is generally accepted as 1<br />cm/s2. For this level of acceleration, the attenuation results<br />currently available lead to magnitude estimates of 6?8 for the<br />Vayu-type earthquake. It is quite well known that damage to man-made<br />structures generally occurs from shocks of magnitude 5 and above.<br />Thus, the regions said to be affected by Vayu-type earthquakes, shown<br />in Figure 1, are the most likely places where damage-causing<br />earthquakes have been felt in the ancient past. </p>
<p>About prediction of earthquakes, Varaha Mihira is essentially silent.<br />In chapter 4 of B.S. he echoes a previous opinion that when the moon's<br />orb appears like the yoke of a cart stretched south to north, there<br />would be an earthquake. There was also a belief that comets were<br />precursors for earthquakes. Parashara mentions that the comet chala<br />ketu which appears once in 5000 years shakes the earth and destroys a<br />populated country in the Madhyadesha. Similarly, he held the opinion<br />that the comet Dhruva Ketu which appears at irregular intervals also<br />portends earthquakes.<br />There was also a strong belief about earthquakes being an omen for<br />further tragedy. Ballala Sena would like us to believe earthquake<br />citations from Puranas and Mahabharatha as historical evidence to this<br />effect. The great epic cites earthquakes in Udyoga Parvan, in Drona<br />Parvan, in Salya Parvan and three times in Gada Parvan. The graphic<br />description in Salya Parvan is Chachala Sabdam Kurvana Saparvatavana<br />Mahi (The earth moved along with mountains and forests making sound).<br />At other places, the epic does not associate sound with the tremors.<br />If accepted as factual, this would be the main shock accompanied by<br />three aftershocks felt at Kurukshetra during the great war (circa 3000<br />BC). Apart from this speculation nothing more can be gleaned about the<br />dates of earthquakes, from the books under reference.</p>
<p>The belief of linking earthquakes with the demise of important<br />personages, appears to be derived from Buddhist traditions. </p>
<p>Narratives7 about Buddha's life mention that immediately after Buddha<br />attained Nirvana (at Kushinagara in 483 BC), the earth trembled, stars<br />fell down and celestial music was heard. Three months prior to this<br />final act, the traditional texts state that when Buddha was camping in<br />a grove to the north of the village Upabhoga, there was an earthquake.<br />Buddha himself is said to have interpreted the earthquake as the sign<br />that he would soon pass away into Nirvana.</p>
<p>Earthquakes have been occurring from ancient times in India and our<br />ancestors took considerable interest in these as with other unusual<br />phenomena. There has been an effort over centuries, to identify places<br />which suffered from earthquakes. Varaha Mihira's approach of<br />describing earthquakes in terms</p>
<p>of the extent of ground shaking is refreshingly scientific. The<br />information available so far though very little, is valuable. It is<br />quite likely that there are Sanskrit manuscripts with scientific<br />information yet to be published. It is hoped that persons responsible<br />for preparing seismic zonation maps of the country, study the relevant<br />literature written prior to the colonial period before drawing<br />conclusions on the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  Earthquakes in ancient India </p>
<p>  R. N. Iyengar</p>
<p>  Strong earthquakes in quick succession in the country have <br />heightened<br />  the sensitivity of the common man towards this natural phenomenon.<br />  Effects of earthquakes can be so severe as to cause social and<br />  political upheavals apart from property damage.</p>
<p>  Thus mitigation of seismic risk in big cities is a matter of <br />concern<br />  to engineers and administrators alike. All the current scientific<br />  approaches the world over, depend on historical records for <br />estimating<br />  the seismic hazard in a given region.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately for the Indian subcontinent, reliable data on place <br />and<br />  date are available for the past two hundred years only. A recent <br />work<br />  undertaken by<br />  Iyengar et al.1 has led to a reliable identification of another <br />twenty<br />  earthquake occurrences in the medieval period (12?18th century AD).<br />  This still leaves the ancient period almost blank except for stray<br />  references. However, this does not mean that ancient Indians were <br />not<br />  fascinated or not affected by earthquakes. </p>
<p>  The Vedas, Puranas and the epics contain many references to<br />  earthquakes and allied phenomena. But what may be of interest in <br />the<br />  contemporary context, are the writings of persons who were <br />acclaimed<br />  scholars of their days. There exist a large number of writings in<br />  Sanskrit on natural phenomena. Among these, at least two are <br />available<br />  in print namely, Brihat Samhita (B.S.) of Varaha Mihira2 (5?6th<br />  century AD) and Adbhuta Sagara (A.S.) of Ballala Sena3 (10?11th<br />  century AD).</p>
<p>  Discussion on causes of earthquakes had been a perennial topic in<br />  ancient Indian literature. According to A.S., the opinion of <br />Kashyapa<br />  was that earthquakes were due to movement of sea creatures, whereas<br />  Garga opined that it was due to the sigh of elephants carrying the <br />earth.</p>
<p>  According to Vasishta, tremors were due to interaction of two <br />strong<br />  winds which eventually impacted the oceans and shook the earth.<br />  Another opinion was that earthquakes occurred due to chance or <br />unseen<br />  forces. Finally, both B.S. and A.S. give an explanation due to<br />  Parashara that once upon a time mountains could fly and move. Thus<br />  they were frequently falling on the earth causing earthquakes<br />  continuously. At the request of the earth, the Creator ordered <br />Indra<br />  (thunder) to cut the wings of the mountains so that the earth <br />became<br />  stable. </p>
<p>  Yet, the four elements namely Wind, Fire and Water along with Indra<br />  cause the earth to shake. This explanation originating from the Rig<br />  Veda has been given in the two texts as a rudimentary theory on<br />  formation of stable continents and not in any religious sense. <br />Ballala<br />  Sena quotes another writer Ushanas, who was categorical that the <br />four<br />  elements shake the earth in the four quarters east, south, west and<br />  Parashara was of the opinion that eclipses and planetary <br />aberrations<br />  could also cause earthquakes. Over the centuries this idea might <br />have<br />  been given up since A.S. does not list this reason.</p>
<p>  After discussing the causes, both the books turn their attention to<br />  classification of earthquakes into four groups, depending on the <br />time<br />  of occurrence and the reigning stellar constellation. Thus, an<br />  earthquake which occurs from north in the last quarter of the <br />night or<br />  in the first quarter of the day under any of the stars Asvini,<br />  Mrigasira, Punarvasu, Hasta, Chitta, Svati or Uttarapalguni <br />belongs to<br />  the wind group (Vayavya). </p>
<p>  The directions of occurrence are not explicitly mentioned in B.S.<br />  These were given by Ushanas as quoted in A.S. It is also mentioned<br />  that many scholars do not accept the classification based on the <br />time<br />  of occurrence. Similarly, earthquakes of the Agni (fire), Indra and<br />  Varuna (water) group originate from south, east and west, <br />respectively<br />  and are governed by specific star groups. Neither of the books<br />  indicate how the directions are to be fixed. It is observed that so<br />  far the effort has been only to group the earthquakes after their<br />  occurrence, according to some recognizable attributes.</p>
<p>  About the effects of earthquakes, Varaha Mihira does not mention <br />about<br />  damages to buildings. However other writers are categorical that<br />  Vayu-type earthquakes lead to extensive destruction of houses,<br />  monasteries, temples, palaces, towers and forts. The after-effects<br />  mentioned are occurrences of windstorms within a week after such an<br />  earthquake. Similarly, the Agni-type earthquake induces surface <br />fires<br />  engulfing villages and towns.</p>
<p>  Rivers and water sources dry up. Indra-type tremors, lead to rains<br />  and elimination of pest colonies. The Varuna-type earthquake kills<br />  people living along river and sea coasts. Earthquakes were also<br />  supposed to be a portent for impending death of kings, outbreak of<br />  wars and epidemics. In B.S. the list of regions affected, is short,<br />  whereas information given in A.S. from various sources including <br />those<br />  of B.S. is more exhaustive. The geographical regions disturbed by<br />  earthquakes according to both the books are as follows.</p>
<p>  Vayu-type earthquake</p>
<p>  B.S.: Saurashtra, Kuru, Magadha, Dasarna, Matsya; A.S.: Yavana,<br />  Dandaka, Salva, Sauvardhana, Pulinda, Videha, Nala, Darada, Anga,<br />  Vanga, Avanti, Malva, Trigarta, Sauvira, Yaudheya, Ksudraka, <br />Shivika,<br />  Madraka, Shaka, Kamboja, Bahlika, Gandhara, Kalinga, Sabara, <br />Mlechha,<br />  Tangana.</p>
<p>  Agni-type earthquake</p>
<p>  B.S.: Ashmaka, Anga, Bahlika, Tangana, Kalinga, Vanga, Dravida,<br />  Shabara; A.S.: Pulinda, Yavana, Odhra, Avanti, Iksvaku, Kuluta,<br />  Tushara, Shivika, Trigarta, Videha, Surastra, Madhyadesh, Dasarna.</p>
<p>  Indra-type earthquake</p>
<p>  B.S.: Kashi, Yugandhara, Paurava,<br />  Kirata, Kira, Abhisara, Hala, Madra,<br />  Arbuda, Saurastra, Malva; A.S.: Kashmira, Dravida, Andhaka, China,<br />  Prachya, Shaka, Pahlava, Dandaka, Kailasa, Malla, Vahala.</p>
<p>  Varuna-type earthquake</p>
<p>  B.S.: Gonarda, Chedi, Kukkura, Kirata, Videha; A.S.: Kashmira, <br />Parata,<br />  Vatsa, Abraka, Karusha, Sinhala.</p>
<p>  It was recognized by all the authors that earthquakes may occur <br />under<br />  any star at any time. Thus, combination-type earthquakes became<br />  possible. The places affected by such mixed-type tremors as <br />mentioned<br />  by Parashara, are reported in A.S.</p>
<p>  Vayu?Agni: Kuru, Salva, Matsya, Nishadha, Pundra, Andhra, Kalinga,<br />  Vindhya foothills.</p>
<p>  Vayu?Indra: Prachya, Shaka, China, Pahlava, Yaudheya, Yavana, <br />Magadha.</p>
<p>  Vayu?Varuna: Avantika, Pulinda, Videha, Kashmira, Darada.</p>
<p>  Agni?Indra: Ikshvaku, Patachara, Abhira, China, Barukacha.</p>
<p>  Agni?Varuna: Gonarda, Anganarajya, Coastal regions.</p>
<p>  Indra?Varuna: Kashi, Abhisara, Achyuta, Kachadvipa.</p>
<p>  The effects of these earthquakes were supposed to be a combination <br />of<br />  the effects of the primary types described earlier. Many of the <br />places<br />  in the list given earlier are easily identifiable with their<br />  present-day equivalents. Several regions are outside the present-<br />day<br />  Indian political boundary. </p>
<p>  In Figure 1, the regions are marked taking into account the ancient<br />  geography of India as described in the works of Kautilya, Varaha<br />  Mihira, Bana, Kalhana and others. A question may arise as to how<br />  widespread the knowledge was about seismic regions in ancient <br />times,<br />  and whether Dravida was in South India. Fortunately, a book in<br />  Kannada, Lokopakarakam, written in 1025 AD by Chamunda Raya4 under <br />the<br />  patronage of the Chalukyan king Jayasimha is available as a<br />  cross-reference. This author devotes briefly eight stanzas for<br />  describing the four types of earthquakes. For the Vayu-type<br />  earthquake, he indicates the affected places as Kurumagadha, <br />Magadha,<br />  Dravida and Kuntala. In his own explanation, Chamunda Raya <br />identifies<br />  Dravida with Tigula Desha</p>
<p>  (Tamil country). For Agni-type earthquakes he includes in his list<br />  Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Kerala, Bahlika and Dravida. According to <br />this<br />  book, Indra-type earthquakes affect only Saurashtra and Abhisara;   whereas Varuna-type earthquakes affect Videha, Govardhana, Nishadha<br />  and Vihara.</p>
<p>  Interpretation of old texts concerning natural phenomena is <br />difficult.<br />  Still, seen critically from the present-day perspective the<br />  delineation of the country into four major seismic zones of <br />differing<br />  damage types, 1500 years ago is no mean achievement. This indicates<br />  some kind of observation and data collection. All the regions <br />listed<br />  are presently known to be susceptible to earthquakes. But it is<br />  interesting to note that Dravida (Tamil country), Kuntala (North<br />  Karnataka), Ashmaka (Maharashtra), Andhra and Odhra (Orissa) were<br />  considered to be earthquake prone to varying degrees. </p>
<p>  A significantly quantitative approach to earthquakes is reflected <br />in<br />  the ancient writings. Vayu-type earthquake was unanimously <br />accepted as<br />  the most destructive. Opinions differed about the other three. Some<br />  held that Agni-, Varuna-, and Indra-type earthquakes in that order<br />  were decreasingly harmful. It was perhaps in this context that the<br />  ancient writings introduced the extent of ground shaking as a <br />measure<br />  of the four types. Ballala Sena in his A.S. first cites the book<br />  Bhargaviya which perhaps belongs to a period earlier than B.S.<br />  According to this text, the extent of ground shaking is 200 yojanas<br />  during Vayu-type earthquake. The corresponding values for Agni-,<br />  Indra- and Varuna-type earthquakes are given as 90, 80 and 70 <br />yojanas,<br />  respectively. It may be speculated that this order was a <br />reflection of<br />  the descending order of socially harmful effects associated with <br />the<br />  four types of tremors. Varaha Mihira agrees with only the first <br />value<br />  and for the other three, his values are Varuna-type 180, Indra-type<br />  160, and Agni-type 110. No information is available on how these <br />were<br />  obtained or measured. However, these values are amenable for </p>
<p>  interpretation from a contemporary perspective. One yojana is <br />equal to<br />  6 miles or 9.6 km as per actual measurements carried out by <br />Stein5, of<br />  distances mentioned by Kalhana in his Rajatarangini. Thus, Vayu-<br />type<br />  earthquakes could have had a radius of area of perceptibility of <br />(100<br />  yojana) 960 km.</p>
<p>  This may be compared with some modern values. The mean radius of<br />  percep-tibility for the great earthquakes of Assam (1897) and Bihar<br />  (1934) were 1440 km and 1280 km, respectively6. The level of human<br />  perceptibility for ground acceleration is generally accepted as 1<br />  cm/s2. For this level of acceleration, the attenuation results<br />  currently available lead to magnitude estimates of 6?8 for the<br />  Vayu-type earthquake. It is quite well known that damage to man-<br />made<br />  structures generally occurs from shocks of magnitude 5 and above.<br />  Thus, the regions said to be affected by Vayu-type earthquakes, <br />shown<br />  in Figure 1, are the most likely places where damage-causing<br />  earthquakes have been felt in the ancient past. </p>
<p>  About prediction of earthquakes, Varaha Mihira is essentially <br />silent.<br />  In chapter 4 of B.S. he echoes a previous opinion that when the <br />moon's<br />  orb appears like the yoke of a cart stretched south to north, there<br />  would be an earthquake. There was also a belief that comets were<br />  precursors for earthquakes. Parashara mentions that the comet chala<br />  ketu which appears once in 5000 years shakes the earth and <br />destroys a<br />  populated country in the Madhyadesha. Similarly, he held the <br />opinion<br />  that the comet Dhruva Ketu which appears at irregular intervals <br />also<br />  portends earthquakes.<br />  There was also a strong belief about earthquakes being an omen for<br />  further tragedy. Ballala Sena would like us to believe earthquake<br />  citations from Puranas and Mahabharatha as historical evidence to <br />this<br />  effect. The great epic cites earthquakes in Udyoga Parvan, in Drona<br />  Parvan, in Salya Parvan and three times in Gada Parvan. The graphic<br />  description in Salya Parvan is Chachala Sabdam Kurvana <br />Saparvatavana<br />  Mahi (The earth moved along with mountains and forests making <br />sound).<br />  At other places, the epic does not associate sound with the <br />tremors.<br />  If accepted as factual, this would be the main shock accompanied by<br />  three aftershocks felt at Kurukshetra during the great war (circa <br />3000<br />  BC). Apart from this speculation nothing more can be gleaned about <br />the<br />  dates of earthquakes, from the books under reference.</p>
<p>  The belief of linking earthquakes with the demise of important<br />  personages, appears to be derived from Buddhist traditions. </p>
<p>  Narratives7 about Buddha's life mention that immediately after <br />Buddha<br />  attained Nirvana (at Kushinagara in 483 BC), the earth trembled, <br />stars<br />  fell down and celestial music was heard. Three months prior to this<br />  final act, the traditional texts state that when Buddha was <br />camping in<br />  a grove to the north of the village Upabhoga, there was an <br />earthquake.<br />  Buddha himself is said to have interpreted the earthquake as the <br />sign<br />  that he would soon pass away into Nirvana.</p>
<p>  Earthquakes have been occurring from ancient times in India and our<br />  ancestors took considerable interest in these as with other unusual<br />  phenomena. There has been an effort over centuries, to identify <br />places<br />  which suffered from earthquakes. Varaha Mihira's approach of<br />  describing earthquakes in terms</p>
<p>  of the extent of ground shaking is refreshingly scientific. The<br />  information available so far though very little, is valuable. It is<br />  quite likely that there are Sanskrit manuscripts with scientific<br />  information yet to be published. It is hoped that persons <br />responsible<br />  for preparing seismic zonation maps of the country, study the <br />relevant<br />  literature written prior to the colonial period before drawing<br />  conclusions on the subject.</p>
