<p>the earlier discussion on this also discussed ice ages.<br />the period that many claim to have a civilisation ,we should also <br />analyse if the ice covered the continents.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>
<blockquote><p>  We can only produce logical conclusions for these facts. For ex: <br />Darwins theory, It is my personal opinion (along with many religious </p></blockquote>
<p>sects) that the theory is flawed and not true, simple question for a <br />layman would be, if Man was to have come from the monkey, why are <br />monkeys not becoming men any more? Geological environmental <br />situations ? I would not buy that. So how does this context relate <br />with Lemurians and the rest of the world. I believe that creations <br />has been simultaneous and not based out of migration from one land to <br />another(which is a by product at some places). Human evolution has <br />been spontaneous and there are always super humans and normal / under <br />evolved humans on earth. Comparitively, New york is more developed <br />than a remote village in Africa or the aborginees of australia. In <br />about a few thousand years later, when the world graphics change and <br />it reconstructs itself (as it did during the ice age), there may be a <br />place where the future archeologists will</p>
<blockquote><p>  find that we did not exist and the native australians were the <br />first ones to figure out farming. </p>
<p>  Again this is a theory and logical. There are relative figuratives <br />when we look to religion to side with this theory though. for ex: </p></blockquote>
<p>those who believe in hinduism can say that Super humans (persons like <br />Rama / ravana etc) coexisted with humans ( common men / sages etc) <br />and super evolved animals (hanuman etc). In short creation has been <br />spontanic and there is no practical timeline to adjudicate the fact <br />that this event happened only at this point in time etc. These are <br />guidelines for this era. Creation (shristi) has been simultaneous and <br />we are only working on a sequential program once we figure out the <br />non sequential process of creation it will give various answers to <br />unsolved mysteries.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hence, according to me, the real origins of physical findings on <br />1st tamil sangam are a very difficult pill to swallow. There can be </p></blockquote>
<p>only logical conclusions. </p>

<p>  wheel, and agriculture were the primary instruments of an <br />advancing <br />  civilisation.</p>
<p>  Most historians regard the wheel as one of the oldest and most <br />  important inventions, which originated in ancient Sumer in <br />  Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in the 5th millennium BC, originally in <br />the <br />  function of potter's wheels. The wheel reached India and Pakistan <br />  with the Indus Valley Civilization in the 3rd millennium BC</p>
<p>  so did lemuria function with out a wheel?</p>
<p>  LEMURIA</p>
<p>  Geologists today regard sunken continents as physical <br />  impossibilities, given the isostatic equilibrium of continental <br />  plates floating on the thermoplastic mantle.</p>
<p>  Though the living modern lemurs are only found in Madagascar and <br />  several surrounding islands, the biogeography of extinct lemurs <br />  extending from Pakistan to Malaysia inspired the name Lemuria, <br />which <br />  was coined in 1864 by the geologist Philip Sclater in an article <br />"The <br />  Mammals of Madagascar" in The Quarterly Journal of Science. <br />Puzzled <br />  by the presence of fossil lemurs in both Madagascar and India, but <br />  not in Africa nor the Middle East, Sclater proposed that <br />Madagascar <br />  and India had once been part of a larger continent, which he named <br />  "Lemuria" for its lemurs.</p>
<p>  Sclater's theory was hardly unusual for his time. The acceptance <br />of <br />  Darwinism led scientists to seek to trace the diffusion of species <br />  from their points of evolutionary origin; prior to the acceptance <br />of <br />  continental drift, biologists frequently postulated submerged land <br />  masses in order to account for populations of land-based species <br />now <br />  separated by barriers of water. </p>
<p>  In 1999, drilling by the JOIDES Resolution research vessel in the <br />  Indian Ocean discovered evidence [1] that a continent about a <br />third <br />  of the size of Australia sank about 20 million years ago. Samples <br />  showed pollen and fragments of wood in a 90 million-year-old <br />  sediment. This might lead one to expect similarity of dinosaur <br />fossil <br />  evidence and will help to understand the breakup of the Indian and <br />  Australian land masses; it does not support the concept of Lemuria <br />OF <br />  6TH MILLIENIUM BC</p>

<p>    Hello</p>
<p>    Personally I think Lemuria sinking is prior to the age of <br />Mathura's <br />  destruction. Lemuria is quoted as a place where Mt.Meru is ( a <br />  philosophical quote). <br />    The association of Tamil with Lemuria as Atlantis to Sanskrit is <br />  somewhat known. Veeramahendra puram and Elangai (depicted in the <br />  legends) seem to have association with the 1st tamil sangam. Ages <br />of <br />  those are into the treta yuga and earlier to it dating the 1st to <br />be <br />  atleast 6000 yrs BC. </p>

<p>    dear friends,<br />    it is interesting to read the different view points.<br />    lemuria taken over by the sea(indian ocean?)is more or<br />    less an established fact.<br />    so we have to take that also into consideration.<br />    so we would have had first and second sangams much<br />    much before our known chronology.<br />    second sangam in my personal opinion would have been<br />    in and around 2000 B.C.<br />    can any body correct me if i am wrong?<br />    regards,<br />    ramnath.</p>

<p>      Perfect analysis, real good information.</p>
<p>      Fiction or not : on a side track: The origins of<br />      Sangam age have always been very confusing and<br />      debatable, I have read one convincing argument that<br />      Sangam age was in the Lemuria (for ones who believe<br />      in one) and prior to the sinking ( &amp; Tsunamis), the<br />      then Pandya king was made to move his Capital to a<br />      high land, Then Mathurai with the same model<br />      constructions. So the origin of actual sangam age<br />      (&amp;Tamil by itself) could be much older. </p>

<p>        I doubt if there were Telugu inscriptions before<br />      or during <br />      Karikala's time(2century BC-1century AD?) Most of<br />      the inscriptions <br />      north of Tamilakam were mostly in Prakarit or<br />      sanskrit or in Brahmi. <br />      This was something I read, but no clear proof or<br />      evidences currently <br />      available. If for the very same logic or reasoning<br />      then Pallavas <br />      should be giving their inscriptions in Telugu or a<br />      Telugu Brahmi, <br />      but clearly no, as they are mostly in Sanskrit or<br />      variant. Refer to <br />      Mahabalipuram or Kanchi inscriptions from<br />      Simhavishnu or Rajasimhan.<br />      ===============</p>
<p>      DEAR NANDA :: FOR QUICK RECOLLECTION :  </p>
<p>      AROUND 3RD AD : (TAMIL ) SANGAM AGE. NO<br />      INSCRIPTION. NO STANDING <br />      EVIDENCE. DURING THE BRITISH, ATLEAST TILL<br />      RECENTLY. THANKS TO <br />      TSUNAMI, DR. THIAGA SATHIYAMURTHY (AASAI Founder)<br />      Retd Suptt <br />      Archeologist FOUND &amp; IDENTIFIED A TEMPLE - MURUGA<br />      TEMPLE - WITH <br />      THREE TIER BASEMENT - BRICK - STONE - BRICK AND<br />      ATTRIBUTED TO SAMGAM <br />      AGE. NOW ASI - AFTER SCIENTIFIC TESTS - HAS AGREED<br />      TO THIS TO BE OF <br />      SANGAM AGE TEMPLE - STANDING EVIDENCE. </p>
<p>      3RD TO 5TH AD :: KALABRAS. SPECULATIONS OF THEIR<br />      ORIGIN.. INCLUDING <br />      WHETHER THEY ARE JAINS... KAADVARKON PANDYA IS<br />      CONSIDERED KALABRA - <br />      WHO IS DESIGNATED NAAYANMAR.</p>
<p>      6 to 8th AD :: " Jithath Simha Vishnu, Thanja <br />      Haraha " is the <br />      inscription (as you rightly mentioned ) in Saskrit<br />      - in Rock Fort <br />      Temple, Trichy, CONFIRMING that Trichy - Thanjavur<br />      - Cauvery Belt <br />      was under Pallava Rule from Simhavishnu Days ..</p>
<p>      Around 850 AD : (Recall PS - Kalki - Chozha<br />      details) :: Vijayalayan  <br />      conquored and occupied Thanjai. Thiruvalangadu<br />      Copper plates are <br />      silent on the Mutharayas who were subdued. Our<br />      Group has discussed <br />      this extensively - thanks to Srilankan member<br />      SriHari :: SAATAN <br />      PAZHIYILI was the Mutharaya - who constructed a<br />      Siva temple and <br />      named after him as Pazhayileeswaram in Naarthamalai<br />      (enroute <br />      Pudukkottai from Trichy) - around mid 9th century<br />      (850 or so ). But <br />      from Senthalai (Near Nemam / Thirukkaattupalli<br />      inscriptions) we have <br />      KAVARAN MAARAN and Co., as Mutharayas operated from<br />      Thanjavur around <br />      that period. So it was postulated that Two Sects<br />      of Mutharayas - <br />      one Around the bordering with Pandyas at <br />      Pudukkottai and other sect <br />      at Nemam - close to Thanjai and most probably this<br />      sect of <br />      Mutharayas would have been conquered by<br />      Vijayalayan.</p>
<p>      Dr. Nagaswamy, on his study of Muthurasas<br />      postulated that the <br />      VRIDHARAJA found at Mysore around 5th AD are<br />      MUTHURAJAS from TN who <br />      paved way for this sect and probably this is time<br />      for evolution of  <br />      Kannada language !</p>
<p>      Therefore with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions (pre<br />      Sangam) - Adhiyaman <br />      period inscriptions in Thirukkoilore / Dharmapuri<br />      (Sangam period), <br />      we have Sanskrit / Grantha mix inscriptions<br />      followed and then Tamil <br />      inscriptions again.... with Sankrit separated. For<br />      instance <br />      Thiruvalangadu Copper plates copper plates<br />      (Released by Rajendra I) <br />      comprised of Sanskrit Verses first followed by<br />      Tamil scripts..</p>
<p>      PLEASE PLACE KARIKALA around 500 -550 AD only.</p>
<p>      Telugu / Kannada / Malayam are of later period in<br />      comparison with <br />      Tamil - almost in that Order.</p>
<p>      Linguistic experts may step in and enlighten.</p>

        <p>Precisely, sinking of the super continents in sync with (Noah arc / Macha avatar whatever ) alterations of land mass and geographic patterns prompting an ice age. I still believe humans lived across the earth and only the super humans were able to communicate effectively by remote means. </p>
<p>"R.venketesh" <abhivencat@yahoo.com  wrote: The Lemurian (&amp; Atlantis) continent was super developed by the time <br />the reminder of the world was seen to even discovering fire. </abhivencat@yahoo.com></p>
<p>the earlier discussion on this also discussed ice ages.<br />the period that many claim to have a civilisation ,we should also <br />analyse if the ice covered the continents.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>
<blockquote><p>  We can only produce logical conclusions for these facts. For ex: <br />Darwins theory, It is my personal opinion (along with many religious </p></blockquote>
<p>sects) that the theory is flawed and not true, simple question for a <br />layman would be, if Man was to have come from the monkey, why are <br />monkeys not becoming men any more? Geological environmental <br />situations ? I would not buy that. So how does this context relate <br />with Lemurians and the rest of the world. I believe that creations <br />has been simultaneous and not based out of migration from one land to <br />another(which is a by product at some places). Human evolution has <br />been spontaneous and there are always super humans and normal / under <br />evolved humans on earth. Comparitively, New york is more developed <br />than a remote village in Africa or the aborginees of australia. In <br />about a few thousand years later, when the world graphics change and <br />it reconstructs itself (as it did during the ice age), there may be a <br />place where the future archeologists will</p>
<blockquote><p>  find that we did not exist and the native australians were the <br />first ones to figure out farming. </p>
<p>  Again this is a theory and logical. There are relative figuratives <br />when we look to religion to side with this theory though. for ex: </p></blockquote>
<p>those who believe in hinduism can say that Super humans (persons like <br />Rama / ravana etc) coexisted with humans ( common men / sages etc) <br />and super evolved animals (hanuman etc). In short creation has been <br />spontanic and there is no practical timeline to adjudicate the fact <br />that this event happened only at this point in time etc. These are <br />guidelines for this era. Creation (shristi) has been simultaneous and <br />we are only working on a sequential program once we figure out the <br />non sequential process of creation it will give various answers to <br />unsolved mysteries.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hence, according to me, the real origins of physical findings on <br />1st tamil sangam are a very difficult pill to swallow. There can be </p></blockquote>
<p>only logical conclusions. </p>

<blockquote><p>  like lemuria we should also see the parallel development of mankind</p>
<p>  wheel, and agriculture were the primary instruments of an <br />advancing <br />  civilisation.</p>
<p>  Most historians regard the wheel as one of the oldest and most <br />  important inventions, which originated in ancient Sumer in <br />  Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in the 5th millennium BC, originally in <br />the <br />  function of potter's wheels. The wheel reached India and Pakistan <br />  with the Indus Valley Civilization in the 3rd millennium BC</p>
<p>  so did lemuria function with out a wheel?</p>
<p>  LEMURIA</p>
<p>  Geologists today regard sunken continents as physical <br />  impossibilities, given the isostatic equilibrium of continental <br />  plates floating on the thermoplastic mantle.</p>
<p>  Though the living modern lemurs are only found in Madagascar and <br />  several surrounding islands, the biogeography of extinct lemurs <br />  extending from Pakistan to Malaysia inspired the name Lemuria, <br />which <br />  was coined in 1864 by the geologist Philip Sclater in an article <br />"The <br />  Mammals of Madagascar" in The Quarterly Journal of Science. <br />Puzzled <br />  by the presence of fossil lemurs in both Madagascar and India, but <br />  not in Africa nor the Middle East, Sclater proposed that <br />Madagascar <br />  and India had once been part of a larger continent, which he named <br />  "Lemuria" for its lemurs.</p>
<p>  Sclater's theory was hardly unusual for his time. The acceptance <br />of <br />  Darwinism led scientists to seek to trace the diffusion of species <br />  from their points of evolutionary origin; prior to the acceptance <br />of <br />  continental drift, biologists frequently postulated submerged land <br />  masses in order to account for populations of land-based species <br />now <br />  separated by barriers of water. </p>
<p>  In 1999, drilling by the JOIDES Resolution research vessel in the <br />  Indian Ocean discovered evidence [1] that a continent about a <br />third <br />  of the size of Australia sank about 20 million years ago. Samples <br />  showed pollen and fragments of wood in a 90 million-year-old <br />  sediment. This might lead one to expect similarity of dinosaur <br />fossil <br />  evidence and will help to understand the breakup of the Indian and <br />  Australian land masses; it does not support the concept of Lemuria <br />OF <br />  6TH MILLIENIUM BC</p>

<p>    Hello</p>
<p>    Personally I think Lemuria sinking is prior to the age of <br />Mathura's <br />  destruction. Lemuria is quoted as a place where Mt.Meru is ( a <br />  philosophical quote). <br />    The association of Tamil with Lemuria as Atlantis to Sanskrit is <br />  somewhat known. Veeramahendra puram and Elangai (depicted in the <br />  legends) seem to have association with the 1st tamil sangam. Ages <br />of <br />  those are into the treta yuga and earlier to it dating the 1st to <br />be <br />  atleast 6000 yrs BC. </p>

<p>    dear friends,<br />    it is interesting to read the different view points.<br />    lemuria taken over by the sea(indian ocean?)is more or<br />    less an established fact.<br />    so we have to take that also into consideration.<br />    so we would have had first and second sangams much<br />    much before our known chronology.<br />    second sangam in my personal opinion would have been<br />    in and around 2000 B.C.<br />    can any body correct me if i am wrong?<br />    regards,<br />    ramnath.</p>

<p>      Perfect analysis, real good information.</p>
<p>      Fiction or not : on a side track: The origins of<br />      Sangam age have always been very confusing and<br />      debatable, I have read one convincing argument that<br />      Sangam age was in the Lemuria (for ones who believe<br />      in one) and prior to the sinking ( &amp; Tsunamis), the<br />      then Pandya king was made to move his Capital to a<br />      high land, Then Mathurai with the same model<br />      constructions. So the origin of actual sangam age<br />      (&amp;Tamil by itself) could be much older. </p>

<p>        I doubt if there were Telugu inscriptions before<br />      or during <br />      Karikala's time(2century BC-1century AD?) Most of<br />      the inscriptions <br />      north of Tamilakam were mostly in Prakarit or<br />      sanskrit or in Brahmi. <br />      This was something I read, but no clear proof or<br />      evidences currently <br />      available. If for the very same logic or reasoning<br />      then Pallavas <br />      should be giving their inscriptions in Telugu or a<br />      Telugu Brahmi, <br />      but clearly no, as they are mostly in Sanskrit or<br />      variant. Refer to <br />      Mahabalipuram or Kanchi inscriptions from<br />      Simhavishnu or Rajasimhan.<br />      ===============</p>
<p>      DEAR NANDA :: FOR QUICK RECOLLECTION : </p>
<p>      AROUND 3RD AD : (TAMIL ) SANGAM AGE. NO<br />      INSCRIPTION. NO STANDING <br />      EVIDENCE. DURING THE BRITISH, ATLEAST TILL<br />      RECENTLY. THANKS TO <br />      TSUNAMI, DR. THIAGA SATHIYAMURTHY (AASAI Founder)<br />      Retd Suptt <br />      Archeologist FOUND &amp; IDENTIFIED A TEMPLE - MURUGA<br />      TEMPLE - WITH <br />      THREE TIER BASEMENT - BRICK - STONE - BRICK AND<br />      ATTRIBUTED TO SAMGAM <br />      AGE. NOW ASI - AFTER SCIENTIFIC TESTS - HAS AGREED<br />      TO THIS TO BE OF <br />      SANGAM AGE TEMPLE - STANDING EVIDENCE. </p>
<p>      3RD TO 5TH AD :: KALABRAS. SPECULATIONS OF THEIR<br />      ORIGIN.. INCLUDING <br />      WHETHER THEY ARE JAINS... KAADVARKON PANDYA IS<br />      CONSIDERED KALABRA - <br />      WHO IS DESIGNATED NAAYANMAR.</p>
<p>      6 to 8th AD :: " Jithath Simha Vishnu, Thanja <br />      Haraha " is the <br />      inscription (as you rightly mentioned ) in Saskrit<br />      - in Rock Fort <br />      Temple, Trichy, CONFIRMING that Trichy - Thanjavur<br />      - Cauvery Belt <br />      was under Pallava Rule from Simhavishnu Days ..</p>
<p>      Around 850 AD : (Recall PS - Kalki - Chozha<br />      details) :: Vijayalayan <br />      conquored and occupied Thanjai. Thiruvalangadu<br />      Copper plates are <br />      silent on the Mutharayas who were subdued. Our<br />      Group has discussed <br />      this extensively - thanks to Srilankan member<br />      SriHari :: SAATAN <br />      PAZHIYILI was the Mutharaya - who constructed a<br />      Siva temple and <br />      named after him as Pazhayileeswaram in Naarthamalai<br />      (enroute <br />      Pudukkottai from Trichy) - around mid 9th century<br />      (850 or so ). But <br />      from Senthalai (Near Nemam / Thirukkaattupalli<br />      inscriptions) we have <br />      KAVARAN MAARAN and Co., as Mutharayas operated from<br />      Thanjavur around <br />      that period. So it was postulated that Two Sects<br />      of Mutharayas - <br />      one Around the bordering with Pandyas at <br />      Pudukkottai and other sect <br />      at Nemam - close to Thanjai and most probably this<br />      sect of <br />      Mutharayas would have been conquered by<br />      Vijayalayan.</p>
<p>      Dr. Nagaswamy, on his study of Muthurasas<br />      postulated that the <br />      VRIDHARAJA found at Mysore around 5th AD are<br />      MUTHURAJAS from TN who <br />      paved way for this sect and probably this is time<br />      for evolution of <br />      Kannada language !</p>
<p>      Therefore with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions (pre<br />      Sangam) - Adhiyaman <br />      period inscriptions in Thirukkoilore / Dharmapuri<br />      (Sangam period), <br />      we have Sanskrit / Grantha mix inscriptions<br />      followed and then Tamil <br />      inscriptions again.... with Sankrit separated. For<br />      instance <br />      Thiruvalangadu Copper plates copper plates<br />      (Released by Rajendra I) <br />      comprised of Sanskrit Verses first followed by<br />      Tamil scripts..</p>
<p>      PLEASE PLACE KARIKALA around 500 -550 AD only.</p>
<p>      Telugu / Kannada / Malayam are of later period in<br />      comparison with <br />      Tamil - almost in that Order.</p>
<p>      Linguistic experts may step in and enlighten.</p>
