<p>Was NANDHINI - daughter of Veerapandian or his Lover ?</p>
<p>should also add was nadhini good or bad?<br />was she a feminine repesentation of naganandhi- kalkis common<br />personification of evil?</p>
<p>just one small info. many people assumed kalki finished <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  abruptly<br />because he could nto justify nandini's charecter. he was writing a<br />weekly and had comited himself much ahead. but then in1954 kalki<br />finished <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  serial in may, fell sicj in august and died in december.<br />perhaps he had a premonition.<br />so we can absolve nandini of that.</acronym></acronym></p>

        <p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>Thank you and (y)our dear friend Kannan for brininging out these <br />mathemtical marvels.</p>
<p>And NANDHINI ..</p>
<p>Right from her very name, everything is seductive about her !</p>
<p>So near .. yet not in reach .. mix of almost all of the Navarasas !</p>
<p>Pazhuvur - Avani Ganthaveeswaram Temple inscriptions - talk of Pazhuvur <br />Nakkan Panchavanmadevi .. !</p>
<p>They do mention of Maravan Kandan pazhuvettarayar. Pls refer Archives <br />for detailed discussion on Pazhuvettarayar..</p>
<p>just for those who are get to dip into detailed History, Chinna <br />Pazhuvettarayar and Nandhini are FICTITIOUS characters !</p>
<p>Most probably the Panchavanmadevi @ Thillayazhagiyar, would have <br />provided inspiration to Kalki to create Nandhini .. !</p>
<p>To know more of PAZHUVUR Historically, pls go through the series <br />articles by Dr. Kalaikkovan (and Dr. Nalini / Dr. Akila) in <br />www.varalaaru.com.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Venkat<br />I beg to differ Nandhini was one of his greatest charectorisations of the female pshche along with Seetha and sivakami....They are complex They change...Nandhini herself agrees that she accepted to tend to Veera pandiyan as he propsed to make her queen however later claims to <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym she said that just to infuriate him...<br />Daughter...is probably correct...</acronym></p>
<p>Regarding Her becomin the band leader...its by her design ....<br />Remember Ravidasan reciting to her the events....She tries to say something...they let her live...and she runs in front to pazhuvettarayar...she then works up the rungs and uses Ravidasan and co as much as she uses the rest to reach the top to get back at all those who caused her pain as a child...</p>

<p>    Hi, This is K.Balaji;     <br />    It is presented in many places in the novel, subsequent to the <br />death <br />    of Peria Pazhuvettaraiyar, that Nandhini is daughter of Pandian, <br />    presumably Veerapandian.</p>
<p>  HI veerapandian - was a name many kings took - so were there two <br />veera <br />  pandian - one the father of nandhini and the other her <br />  lover....because in the start kalki's clearly says that when AK <br />hunted <br />  down pandian to the hut, nandhini asks him to spare her lover. this <br />  infuriates him to behead the wounded and unarmed pandia much <br />against <br />  yuddha darma..also AK laments and repents on hearing who <br />veerapandia <br />  was just before he is assasinated (??) killed / comitts suicide.</p>
<p>  pandya's seem to crop up every where during that time. same way who <br />  was the small boy who was crowned in the jungle as pandya king ?</p>
<p>  so much for fiction, now some facts for discussion:</p>
<p>  incidentally i was with Kudavoil Balu sir and he explained to me <br />that <br />  the initial reading of the Udayarkudi inscription was wrong and <br />this <br />  led to whole line of wrongful inferences ( incl KAN)...as per him <br />the <br />  udayarkudi inscription - is as follows:</p>
<p>  a resident of south arcot wishes to create an endowment for the <br />local <br />  temple. in this regard he seeks a small portion of land and the <br />  village authorities look for an eligible piece - the land <br />identified <br />  is a smallpart of the lands confisticated after the assasination of <br />AK <br />  by the traitors ravidasan/soman sambavan who ran away /banished / <br />  punihsed ( earlier???) - since this is a high profile case and <br />inroder <br />  to clear the title of the land - RRC who was ruling at that time <br />sends <br />  his high officer to ensure that the endowment is done properly. so <br />as <br />  per him the inscription is not noting the date of punishment ( 986 <br />ad) <br />  but the date of the endowment. So there is no proof that ravidasan <br />and <br />  gang held high posts in uttama rule ( if anyone does have any such <br />- <br />  please do let me know), they could have run away after comitting <br />the <br />  crime, justice was not delayed for 16 years.</p>

<p>  Ravidasan was a high officer during sundara time. anyone <br />controdicting <br />  this</p>

<p>Hi venkat,</p>
<p>even though he wrote it as a weekly, am sure he would have had his <br />basics storyline in place - meaning atleast the logical end.....did <br />he as a story teller twist around with the main plot. what made him <br />do it - maybe he had something else in mind when he started and <br />later something came up that made him change his mind....</p>
<p>Or was he doing something akin to our TV serials now, which just <br />meander around based on audience trp - characters are chopped / <br />propped based on popular following - maybe nandhini grew as a <br />character and made him change her role from that of a vamp ( which <br />is how she is initially portrayed) to that of a heroine. maybe he <br />had to come up with the episode where she is tied up and about to be <br />thrown into the funeral pyre of veerapandian to justify her support <br />to the assasins...</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>I remember kalki comparing nandini to a snake, (which he does with <br />naga nandhi.) does anyone else remember the sequence.</p>
<p>by the way what does the name nandhini mean in sanskrit.</p>

<p>  if kalki had written as a novel perhaps he could have corrected it.</p>
<p>  but then he wrote in weekly instalments which a lakh and ten <br />thousand <br />  people( 2 readers per copy) had read already and registered in <br />their <br />  minds.</p>

<p>      Hi, This is K.Balaji;       <br />      It is presented in many places in the novel, subsequent to the <br />  death <br />      of Peria Pazhuvettaraiyar, that Nandhini is daughter of <br />Pandian, <br />      presumably Veerapandian.</p>
<p>    HI veerapandian - was a name many kings took - so were there two <br />  veera <br />    pandian - one the father of nandhini and the other her <br />    lover....because in the start kalki's clearly says that when AK <br />  hunted <br />    down pandian to the hut, nandhini asks him to spare her lover. <br />this <br />    infuriates him to behead the wounded and unarmed pandia much <br />  against <br />    yuddha darma..also AK laments and repents on hearing who <br />  veerapandia <br />    was just before he is assasinated (??) killed / comitts suicide.</p>
<p>    pandya's seem to crop up every where during that time. same way <br />who <br />    was the small boy who was crowned in the jungle as pandya king ?</p>
<p>    so much for fiction, now some facts for discussion:</p>
<p>    incidentally i was with Kudavoil Balu sir and he explained to me <br />  that <br />    the initial reading of the Udayarkudi inscription was wrong and <br />  this <br />    led to whole line of wrongful inferences ( incl KAN)...as per him <br />  the <br />    udayarkudi inscription - is as follows:</p>
<p>    a resident of south arcot wishes to create an endowment for the <br />  local <br />    temple. in this regard he seeks a small portion of land and the <br />    village authorities look for an eligible piece - the land <br />  identified <br />    is a smallpart of the lands confisticated after the assasination <br />of <br />  AK <br />    by the traitors ravidasan/soman sambavan who ran away /banished / <br />    punihsed ( earlier???) - since this is a high profile case and <br />  inroder <br />    to clear the title of the land - RRC who was ruling at that time <br />  sends <br />    his high officer to ensure that the endowment is done properly. <br />so <br />  as <br />    per him the inscription is not noting the date of punishment ( <br />986 <br />  ad) <br />    but the date of the endowment. So there is no proof that <br />ravidasan <br />  and <br />    gang held high posts in uttama rule ( if anyone does have any <br />such <br />  - <br />    please do let me know), they could have run away after comitting <br />  the <br />    crime, justice was not delayed for 16 years.</p>
<p>    some more points for discussion - </p>
<p>    Ravidasan was a high officer during sundara time. anyone <br />  controdicting <br />    this</p>
<p>    his close relative was a high officer in pandya kingdom same time</p>
<p>    Both of them were trained in the chera academy ( kandhalur salai)</p>
<p>    they both plot to assasinate AK as his above unfair treatment of <br />a <br />    fallen foe ( exhibiting his head on a pole)</p>
<p>    due to this reason RRC's first assignment or claim to fame is <br />    destruction of kandalur salai...</p>

<p>dear nanda</p>
<p>KAN colas doesnt give the actual inscription but only his <br />interpretation. now the interpretation itself is being questioned. <br />They couldnt have gone to pandya lands and hence they could hv moved <br />back into chera country.</p>
<p>coming to the actual inscription - unfortunately i dont hv this on <br />me, but will try and source. i too hv the same questions as you and <br />hence i had listed them below my earlier mail - we could pool <br />resources to come up with a conclusion - that could prove the above <br />+ absolve uttama /sembian madevi ( udayar version of events). </p>
<p>maybe arul mozhi was still an infant in 969 ad - as below intersting <br />post in our archives suggest</p>
<p>Vaanavan maadevi - wife of sundara chozha (tirukkovilur malayaman <br />vamsam) - entered funeral pyre of her husband leaving behind a <br />suckling infant     </p>
<p>"...raajarajan ennum puliyai payandha pon maan..<br />...surandha mulaip paal magavodu piriyath thaiyal...."</p>
<p>Further, i am also trying to see the actual tamil words for the <br />famous quote from <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym </p>
<p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym in his eagerness to see the heavens..........Arulmozhi, who is <br />well versed ......, did not desire the kingdom even inwardly as long <br />as his uncle coveted the throne.</acronym></p>
<p>this kind of indicates that uttama wanted the throne....the use of <br />the words desire ( for <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ) and covet ( for Uttama) are suttle - <br />however would love to see the actual tamil version</acronym></p>

        <p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>Do you have any references that Ravidasan was trained at Kandalur salai or he had a relative in a similar position in the Pandiya kingdom? Also as perthe reading provided by <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym , Ravidasan and all his family was banished from Chola or South India, if so which direction would he have to go? north ? if so, which kingdom would have received him?</p>

        <p>Many people would agree, but in the scene which Aditya karikalan remembers from his memory, Nandhini falls in front of Veera pandiyan's and pleads with him to spare her lover(Veera Pandiya). Kalki never tries to prove or state vehemently, that this Veera Pandiyan is the same the one who impregnates Mandakini ammaiyar. So sense of timeline loss is evident here and as alwaysyou have five pandiyas ruling from the pandiya kingdom always. </p>
<p>Another question when it comes to five brothers ruling the pandiya kingdom and the resultant thayathi/pangali fighting? What is the selection process of the pandiya kings? We have seen the chola kings being selected from a council of cheiftains and generals, taking popular public opinion into account also.</p>

<blockquote><p>  nice eternal question</p>
<p>  Was NANDHINI - daughter of Veerapandian or his Lover ?</p>
<p>  should also add was nadhini good or bad?<br />  was she a feminine repesentation of naganandhi- kalkis common<br />  personification of evil?</p>
<p>  just one small info. many people assumed kalki finished PS abruptly<br />  because he could nto justify nandini's charecter. he was writing a<br />  weekly and had comited himself much ahead. but then in1954 kalki<br />  finished ps serial in may, fell sicj in august and died in <br />december.<br />  perhaps he had a premonition.<br />  so we can absolve nandini of that.</p>

<p>Hi, This is K.Balaji;</p>
<p>It is presented in many places in the novel, subsequent to the death <br />of Peria Pazhuvettaraiyar, that Nandhini is daughter of Pandian, <br />presumably Veerapandian.</p>
