</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I cannot find apt words to thank sps sir for his kind introduction - <br />that i got to spend an evening with a legend..Dr. Nagaswamy. during <br />the course of the evening he mentioned about this particular article <br />of his.....</p>
<p><a href="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume1/articles/judges_tenure.h" title="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume1/articles/judges_tenure.h">http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume1/articles/judges_tenure.h</a><br />tml</p>
<p>LIMITATIONS OF JUDGES' TENURE<br />AN ANCIENT EXAMPLE<br />Dr. R. Nagaswamy<br />Recently some of the Judges of the High court were transferred from <br />one place to another. This attracted the attention of the public <br />from different angles. The transfers were effected, according to the <br />authorities, to maintain the highest standards of the judiciary and <br />improve its efficiency. Others questioned this stand and imputed <br />motive. Even one of the judges expressed his disappointment over the <br />transfers. In this connection an ancient lithic (epigraphic) record <br />dated over one thousand years ago, regarding limitation of service <br />tenure of the Judges, would come as a revelation to those interested <br />in the history of Ancient Indian Judiciary. </p>
<p>The record is dated 930 CE, in the reign of the Chola King <br />Parantaka, and is found on a ceiling slab of the Bhaktavatsala <br />temple of Thiruninravur near Madras, Tamilnadu. It is engraved in <br />Tamil letters and relates to the constitution of Judiciary and the <br />limitation of their service.</p>
<p>Before the inscription is studied, it is necessary to note that the <br />Chola emperors, aimed at superlative efficiency in all walks of <br />public administration and did achieve splendid standards, which even <br />modern administrators would envy. The famous Uttaramerur <br />inscription, relating to the qualifications, dis-qualifications, and <br />process of election to the village assembly is an instant, well-<br />known. Two important records from Tamilnad, give a vivid picture of <br />the constitution of judiciary in ancient times. One is an 8th cent. <br />record that comes from the Pandya country and the other 10th cent. <br />record, from a place near Madras, mentioned above.</p>
<p>The judiciary was by and large in the hands of elected village <br />elders, and only in exceptional cases went to the territorial <br />assemblies or ultimately to the King's council. The village courts <br />served as the main back bone of judicial system in ancient India. <br />Called the Panchayat system, in modern times, the village judiciary <br />is mostly misunderstood, as the collective decision of the elders, <br />without the application of any legal procedures known to present <br />times. Most historians held that the legal-judicial system came to <br />be introduced and learned only after the advent of European rule in <br />India. The 8th cent. record from Pandyan country, disproves this <br />assumption emphatically. This record comes from Manur, in <br />Tirunelveli district, and is virtually a written constitution of the <br />village, regarding the election of judges to the village court. The <br />entire village assembly met and drafted the constitution for <br />selecting Judges.</p>
<p>The first qualification prescribed was that a person to be elected <br />as a judge should be a master of at least one legal treatise. The <br />legal treatises are known as dharma sastras and there were many <br />schools of dharma sastras like Manu, Yajnavalkya, Brhaspati, <br />Parasara and others. The one who was to be elected as a Judge, <br />should be a master of at the least one dharma sastra, which means <br />that the village courts were presided over by legal experts and not <br />by casual elders, as is commonly understood. There were strict legal <br />procedures to be adopted, before the case is taken to the village <br />courts.</p>
<p>The Manur record also specifies that the person to be elected to the <br />court should be one, known for his sterling conduct (suvrittaray <br />iruppar). The village assembly should accept the person to be of <br />good conduct to be elected. Since this village was a Brahmin <br />settlement, it further prescribed that a person to be elected should <br />be a master of one Veda and one Brahmana text. It is not mere <br />knowledge, that was wanted, but he should have appeared for an <br />examination in one Veda and one brahmana, and passed the test. There <br />are other aspects mentioned in the record with which we are not <br />concerned here. Thus the above record, stipulates, virtuous conduct, <br />a pass in the stipulated examination and mastery of one law book as <br />basic requirements for being elected to the court. This record does <br />not, however, stipulate the duration for which he can serve or if he <br />has served once the interval that was required for re-election.</p>
<p>This gap is filled up by the Thiruninravur record of 10th cent. <br />mentioned earlier. It mainly addresses itself to the interval that <br />was obsolutely needed to serve in the same court. The Thiruninravur <br />record is also a written constitution of the village judiciary <br />drafted by the whole village assembly, which met for the purpose in <br />930 CE is clear. That the village judiciary and administrative <br />committees were elected to serve for one term.</p>
<p>Once the elected judges have served for one term, they should not be <br />elected for another five years to serve not only as judges but also <br />in other administrative committees. The restriction of five year <br />interval was reduced to two years in the case of relatives like <br />fathers,brothers or sons of those who had served once.</p>
<p>It was thus made obligatory on the part of the judges not to serve <br />two terms consiquently in the same court within an interval of five <br />years, once he has served in the court. His close relatives could <br />not also aspire to become Judges within two years of his service. </p>
<p>It is pertinent to recall the qualification stipulated for a Judge <br />of the village court; a pass in the prescribed examination, mastery <br />of a legal text and above all noble conduct. The dharma sastras <br />insist on the sanctity of judicial pronouncement, failing which, the <br />judge was liable for punishment and would also incur a sin and his <br />emancipation was in danger. Inspite of such strict standards, like <br />upright judgements, good conduct, and high qualifications, his <br />tenure was limited, and that he could not serve in the same court <br />for five years subsiquently.</p>
<p>This indicates the height to which the standards of judicial <br />administration was taken in the Chola period in the l0th and llth <br />cent. C.E. </p>
<p>Whether this system could be applied in modern times is not the <br />concern of this article. The Standards are different now. But it <br />does focus attention on the history of ancient Indian Judiciary, <br />often labelled Pancayat system which is brushed aside as a <br />collective conventional decision, rather than based on written <br />constitution and legal system. The ancient Indian Judiciary <br />functioned only with solid legal procedures and written constitution <br />(called Lekhya Pramanam). In view of the importance of Thiruninravur <br />constitution, an English rendering of the record is given below.</p>
<p>This is the resolution adopted for the prosperity of our <br />village,with<br />effect from the month of Kumbha in the 23rd year, by us the members <br />of<br />the great assembly, which include </p>
<p>(1) the judicial assembly, </p>
<p>(2) the tank maintenance committee (eri variya perumakkal). </p>
<p>(3) the garden maintenance committee (Totta Variya Perumakkal), </p>
<p>(4) the exponents of Sastras (Bhattas) and </p>
<p>(5) the great men (Visishta Perumakkal). </p>
<p>and who assembled in full, inclusive of the young and the old, in <br />the<br />great hall of our village on this day :<br />When the judicial assembly and the (various) committees are to   <br />be<br />constituted from this year onwards, the great assembly <br />(mahasabha)<br />should meet in full in the Brahmasthana of our village, and select<br />only those who are acceptable to the mahasabha: Those who are <br />so<br />selected should not have served in judicial capacity or in the<br />(administrative) committees within five years, prior (to the date <br />of<br />selection), <br />The brothers, fathers and sons of those who served (within) two <br />years<br />prior (to the date of selection), should be excluded. <br />One who is so selected, should not be demanded to do <br />(other)<br />obligatory services, while serving in the Mahasabha. <br />Those who demand other obligatory services from such selected <br />persons,<br />contrary to this resolution, are proclaimed offenders of the <br />village. <br />They (the selected) will receive one Kunri of gold per duration? <br />Those who complete their service, in the judicial assembly, and <br />the<br />(other) cormnittees, should, settle and hand over accounts to   <br />the<br />assembly. <br />We the members of the great assembly resolved thus. <br />Those who act contrary to this resolution, should pay twenty <br />five<br />Kalancu of gold as fine at the court (dharmasana) at the request <br />of<br />the shareholders of Sravanai of our village. <br />This resolution (may be) inscribed on stone. </p>

<p>Our tiny Group met Dr. Kalaikkovan - Dr. Nalini - Dr. Kudavoil - <br />Dr. Rajavelu .. mudhal yaathirai .. varalaaru.com., presenting <br />papers in local meets ...</p>
<p>Now we are now able to sit and discuss and seek clarifications with <br />such respected Scholars !!</p>
<p>Kamal is interviewing Airavatham Mahadevan - Karoshima (Japan) and  <br />writing in detail ..</p>
<p>Gokul's keenness in History ..</p>

<p><a href="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume1/articles/judges_tenure.h" title="http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume1/articles/judges_tenure.h">http://tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume1/articles/judges_tenure.h</a><br />  tml</p>
<p>  LIMITATIONS OF JUDGES' TENURE<br />  AN ANCIENT EXAMPLE<br />  Dr. R. Nagaswamy<br />  Recently some of the Judges of the High court were transferred <br />from <br />  one place to another. This attracted the attention of the public <br />  from different angles. The transfers were effected, according to <br />the <br />  authorities, to maintain the highest standards of the judiciary <br />and <br />  improve its efficiency. Others questioned this stand and imputed <br />  motive. Even one of the judges expressed his disappointment over <br />the <br />  transfers. In this connection an ancient lithic (epigraphic) <br />record <br />  dated over one thousand years ago, regarding limitation of service <br />  tenure of the Judges, would come as a revelation to those <br />interested <br />  in the history of Ancient Indian Judiciary. </p>
<p>  The record is dated 930 CE, in the reign of the Chola King <br />  Parantaka, and is found on a ceiling slab of the Bhaktavatsala <br />  temple of Thiruninravur near Madras, Tamilnadu. It is engraved in <br />  Tamil letters and relates to the constitution of Judiciary and the <br />  limitation of their service.</p>
<p>  Before the inscription is studied, it is necessary to note that <br />the <br />  Chola emperors, aimed at superlative efficiency in all walks of <br />  public administration and did achieve splendid standards, which <br />even <br />  modern administrators would envy. The famous Uttaramerur <br />  inscription, relating to the qualifications, dis-qualifications, <br />and <br />  process of election to the village assembly is an instant, well-<br />  known. Two important records from Tamilnad, give a vivid picture <br />of <br />  the constitution of judiciary in ancient times. One is an 8th <br />cent. <br />  record that comes from the Pandya country and the other 10th cent. <br />  record, from a place near Madras, mentioned above.</p>
<p>  The judiciary was by and large in the hands of elected village <br />  elders, and only in exceptional cases went to the territorial <br />  assemblies or ultimately to the King's council. The village courts <br />  served as the main back bone of judicial system in ancient India. <br />  Called the Panchayat system, in modern times, the village <br />judiciary <br />  is mostly misunderstood, as the collective decision of the elders, <br />  without the application of any legal procedures known to present <br />  times. Most historians held that the legal-judicial system came to <br />  be introduced and learned only after the advent of European rule <br />in <br />  India. The 8th cent. record from Pandyan country, disproves this <br />  assumption emphatically. This record comes from Manur, in <br />  Tirunelveli district, and is virtually a written constitution of <br />the <br />  village, regarding the election of judges to the village court. <br />The <br />  entire village assembly met and drafted the constitution for <br />  selecting Judges.</p>
<p>  The first qualification prescribed was that a person to be elected <br />  as a judge should be a master of at least one legal treatise. The <br />  legal treatises are known as dharma sastras and there were many <br />  schools of dharma sastras like Manu, Yajnavalkya, Brhaspati, <br />  Parasara and others. The one who was to be elected as a Judge, <br />  should be a master of at the least one dharma sastra, which means <br />  that the village courts were presided over by legal experts and <br />not <br />  by casual elders, as is commonly understood. There were strict <br />legal <br />  procedures to be adopted, before the case is taken to the village <br />  courts.</p>
<p>  The Manur record also specifies that the person to be elected to <br />the <br />  court should be one, known for his sterling conduct (suvrittaray <br />  iruppar). The village assembly should accept the person to be of <br />  good conduct to be elected. Since this village was a Brahmin <br />  settlement, it further prescribed that a person to be elected <br />should <br />  be a master of one Veda and one Brahmana text. It is not mere <br />  knowledge, that was wanted, but he should have appeared for an <br />  examination in one Veda and one brahmana, and passed the test. <br />There <br />  are other aspects mentioned in the record with which we are not <br />  concerned here. Thus the above record, stipulates, virtuous <br />conduct, <br />  a pass in the stipulated examination and mastery of one law book <br />as <br />  basic requirements for being elected to the court. This record <br />does <br />  not, however, stipulate the duration for which he can serve or if <br />he <br />  has served once the interval that was required for re-election.</p>
<p>  This gap is filled up by the Thiruninravur record of 10th cent. <br />  mentioned earlier. It mainly addresses itself to the interval that <br />  was obsolutely needed to serve in the same court. The <br />Thiruninravur <br />  record is also a written constitution of the village judiciary <br />  drafted by the whole village assembly, which met for the purpose <br />in <br />  930 CE is clear. That the village judiciary and administrative <br />  committees were elected to serve for one term.</p>
<p>  Once the elected judges have served for one term, they should not <br />be <br />  elected for another five years to serve not only as judges but <br />also <br />  in other administrative committees. The restriction of five year <br />  interval was reduced to two years in the case of relatives like <br />  fathers,brothers or sons of those who had served once.</p>
<p>  It was thus made obligatory on the part of the judges not to serve <br />  two terms consiquently in the same court within an interval of <br />five <br />  years, once he has served in the court. His close relatives could <br />  not also aspire to become Judges within two years of his service. </p>
<p>  It is pertinent to recall the qualification stipulated for a Judge <br />  of the village court; a pass in the prescribed examination, <br />mastery <br />  of a legal text and above all noble conduct. The dharma sastras <br />  insist on the sanctity of judicial pronouncement, failing which, <br />the <br />  judge was liable for punishment and would also incur a sin and his <br />  emancipation was in danger. Inspite of such strict standards, like <br />  upright judgements, good conduct, and high qualifications, his <br />  tenure was limited, and that he could not serve in the same court <br />  for five years subsiquently.</p>
<p>  This indicates the height to which the standards of judicial <br />  administration was taken in the Chola period in the l0th and llth <br />  cent. C.E. </p>
<p>  Whether this system could be applied in modern times is not the <br />  concern of this article. The Standards are different now. But it <br />  does focus attention on the history of ancient Indian Judiciary, <br />  often labelled Pancayat system which is brushed aside as a <br />  collective conventional decision, rather than based on written <br />  constitution and legal system. The ancient Indian Judiciary <br />  functioned only with solid legal procedures and written <br />constitution <br />  (called Lekhya Pramanam). In view of the importance of <br />Thiruninravur <br />  constitution, an English rendering of the record is given below.</p>
<p>  This is the resolution adopted for the prosperity of our <br />  village,with<br />  effect from the month of Kumbha in the 23rd year, by us the <br />members <br />  of<br />  the great assembly, which include </p>
<p>  (1) the judicial assembly, </p>
<p>  (2) the tank maintenance committee (eri variya perumakkal). </p>
<p>  (3) the garden maintenance committee (Totta Variya Perumakkal), </p>
<p>  (4) the exponents of Sastras (Bhattas) and </p>
<p>  (5) the great men (Visishta Perumakkal). </p>
<p>  and who assembled in full, inclusive of the young and the old, in <br />  the<br />  great hall of our village on this day :<br />  When the judicial assembly and the (various) committees are <br />to   <br />  be<br />  constituted from this year onwards, the great assembly <br />  (mahasabha)<br />  should meet in full in the Brahmasthana of our village, and select<br />  only those who are acceptable to the mahasabha: Those who <br />are <br />  so<br />  selected should not have served in judicial capacity or in the<br />  (administrative) committees within five years, prior (to the <br />date <br />  of<br />  selection), <br />  The brothers, fathers and sons of those who served (within) two <br />  years<br />  prior (to the date of selection), should be excluded. <br />  One who is so selected, should not be demanded to do <br />  (other)<br />  obligatory services, while serving in the Mahasabha. <br />  Those who demand other obligatory services from such selected <br />  persons,<br />  contrary to this resolution, are proclaimed offenders of the <br />  village. <br />  They (the selected) will receive one Kunri of gold per duration? <br />  Those who complete their service, in the judicial assembly, and <br />  the<br />  (other) cormnittees, should, settle and hand over accounts to   <br />  the<br />  assembly. <br />  We the members of the great assembly resolved thus. <br />  Those who act contrary to this resolution, should pay twenty <br />  five<br />  Kalancu of gold as fine at the court (dharmasana) at the <br />request <br />  of<br />  the shareholders of Sravanai of our village. <br />  This resolution (may be) inscribed on stone.</p>
